Oil options volatility rose as the
underlying futures fell to the lowest level since May 23 on
speculation that faltering economic growth is dragging down fuel
demand.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 32 percent as of 4 p.m. in  New York , up
from 29.1 percent June 3.  Crude oil for July delivery tumbled $1.21, or 1.2 percent,
to $99.01 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . It was
the first time since May 17 that futures declined for two
consecutive trading days.  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
July $95 puts, with 2,388 lots changing hands. They gained 24
cents to 86 cents a barrel. August $90 puts, the next-most
active option, rose 18 cents to $1.10 a barrel with 1,806 lots
trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  August $85 puts were the most active options traded in the
previous session, with 9,666 lots changing hands. They slipped 2
cent to 47 cents a barrel. The next-most active options, July
$95 puts, dropped 13 cents to 62 cents a barrel on volume of
5,410 lots.  Open interest was highest for December 2012 $80 puts with
46,177 contracts. Next were December 2011 $120 calls with 42,917
and December 2011 $100 calls with 36,956.  To contact the reporter on this story:
