The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries is unlikely to raise production quotas at
this week’s meeting in Vienna, according to Venezuelan Oil
Minister  Rafael Ramirez .  “We have to wait to discuss the situation in the market,
we believe at the moment we’re in balance,” Ramirez said as he
arrived today in the Austrian capital.  Ministers of the 12-nation group will meet on June 8 to
decide whether to keep its production ceiling, which applies to
11 members except  Iraq , at 24.845 million barrels a day. OPEC’s
compliance with existing quotas was 65 percent in April, the
group said on May 11.  Ramirez declined to comment when asked about a possible
increase later this year. “We don’t have any concerns regarding
supply,” he said.  OPEC, responsible for 40 percent of global oil supplies,
needs to discuss the situation in  Libya , Ramirez said. Armed
conflict in the North African nation halted oil production
earlier this year at fields owned by companies including Total
SA and BASF SE.  Sanctions against  Venezuela ’s state-owned oil company are
“unacceptable,” he said. The U.S. last month imposed economic
sanctions on Petroleos de Venezuela SA for working with  Iran ’s
energy industry in ways that might bolster the country’s
“illicit” nuclear program.  The sanctions prohibit PDVSA, as the company is known, from
competing for U.S. government procurement contracts, receiving
financing from the U.S. Export-Import Bank and from obtaining
U.S. export licenses. They don’t prohibit the export of crude
oil to the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
