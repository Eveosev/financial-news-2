South African Minister for Trade and
Industry Rob Davies said food and  oil prices  posed “major
threats” to  Africa ’s biggest economy, while an “overvalued”
rand undermined its manufacturing industry.  “We have to take account of the fact that there are some
major threats on the inflation front: oil prices and food
prices,” Davies told reporters in Johannesburg today. The
 Reserve Bank  last month said inflation will exceed its 3 percent
to 6 percent target range in the first quarter of next year,
before dropping back into the band the next quarter.  Meanwhile, manufacturers “would have made more progress if
we had a more competitive currency” which was inflated due to
capital inflows, some of which stem from quantitative easing in
the U.S., Davies said. “It’s fuelling an appreciation of our
currency,” he said.  Manufacturing, which makes up 15 percent of the economy,
was the best-performing industry in the first quarter, expanding
14.5 percent compared with annualized growth of 4.8 percent in
gross domestic product. That performance may not last, Davies
said.  The rand, which has gained more than 9 percent against the
dollar in the last 18 months, strengthened as much as 0.6
percent to 6.6759 to the dollar today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
