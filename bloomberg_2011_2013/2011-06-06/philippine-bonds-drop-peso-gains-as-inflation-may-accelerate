Philippine benchmark three-year bonds
fell, pushing their yield to a two-week high, before a report
tomorrow that economists predict will show the fastest inflation
in more than two years. The peso was unchanged.  Consumer prices rose 5.1 percent from a year earlier in May,
the most since March 2009, according to the median forecast of
10 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Bangko Sentral ng
Pilipinas, which has raised its benchmark interest rate twice
this year to 4.50 percent, next meets on June 16 to review
borrowing costs.  “If inflation is beyond 5 percent, there is a greater
likelihood of more rate increases,” said Antonio Espedido, a
treasurer at China Banking Corp. in  Manila . “That is putting
some pressure on domestic bonds.”  The yield on the 6.25 percent note due January 2014 climbed
2.5 basis points, or 0.025 percentage point, to 5 percent, as of
2:26 p.m. in Manila, according to Tradition Financial Services.
That is the highest level since May 19. The peso matched its
June 3 closing level of 43.213, after strengthening 0.4 percent
last week, according to Tullett Prebon Plc.  The central bank is “prepared to take additional action if
necessary” to meet this year’s inflation target of 3 percent to
5 percent, Governor Amando Tetangco said May 27.  To contact the reporter for this story:
