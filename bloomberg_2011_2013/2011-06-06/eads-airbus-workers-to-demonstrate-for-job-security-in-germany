Workers at European Aeronautic,
Defence and Space Co. NV’s Airbus SAS unit will demonstrate at
the company’s German factories on Wednesday to try to make the
aircraft maker ensure the future of jobs in the country.  “We now want to get clarification about the next few years
and secure the locations, employment and income until 2020,”
Daniel Friedrich, a spokesman for  Germany ’s IG Metall union,
said today at a meeting with journalists in Hamburg, Germany.  Apart from ensuring that production stays at the four
locations Airbus has in Germany until 2020, the union wants to
increase the number of people getting education at the company,
limit the number of temporary workers to 15 percent of the
workforce from today’s 20 percent, give them equal pay and make
them permanent employees after two years of work, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
