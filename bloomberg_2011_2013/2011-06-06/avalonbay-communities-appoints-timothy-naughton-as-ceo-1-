AvalonBay Communities Inc. (AVB) , the
second-largest publicly traded U.S. apartment owner, appointed
President Timothy J. Naughton to replace Bryce Blair as chief
executive officer at the end of 2011.  Blair will remain as chairman of the board through 2012 and
focus on development and construction, the Virginia-based real
estate investment trust said today in a statement.  AvalonBay, which develops, acquires and manages apartments,
owns or holds an interest in 187 communities with 55,027 homes
in 10 states. Blair started at the company more than 25 years
ago and served as CEO for a decade. Naughton, who has been
president since 2005, joined the company in 1989.  “We are well positioned for the future,” Blair said in
the statement. “Consequently, I felt that the time was right
for me personally and for AvalonBay to initiate a leadership
transition.”  To contact the reporter on this story: Prashant Gopal in New
