The U.S. Supreme Court left intact a
 California  law that makes illegal immigrants eligible for the
reduced tuition paid at public colleges and universities by
legal state residents.  The justices today turned away an appeal by a group of non-
Californians who attend school in the state and pay as much as
$20,000 per year more than residents. The students said 25,000
illegal aliens pay the lower tuition each year, costing the
state $208 million.  California is one of nine states that make undocumented
aliens eligible for in-state tuition, according to the suing
students.  The case turned on a 1996 federal law that limits the power
of states to offer reduced tuition to those in the country
illegally. The law says illegal immigrants can’t claim lower
tuition “on the basis of residence within a state” unless all
U.S. citizens are similarly eligible.  The California law doesn’t explicitly tie the tuition of
illegal aliens to their place of residency. The measure instead
says those students are entitled to the lower tuition if they
graduated from a California high school after having attended
one for at least three years.  The California Supreme Court unanimously upheld the state
law, saying it is based on “other criteria,” not residency.  The case is Martinez v. Regents of the  University of
California , 10-1029.  To contact the reporter on this story:
