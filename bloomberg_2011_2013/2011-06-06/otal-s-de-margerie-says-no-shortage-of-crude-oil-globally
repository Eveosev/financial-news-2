Total SA (FP) ’s Chief Executive Officer
Christophe de Margerie said there’s “no shortage” of oil in
the market as OPEC remains prepared to supply crude.  “It is important that OPEC maintains its commitment to put
on the market as much oil as is necessary, which it will be
doing,” de Margerie told reporters after attending the Asia Oil
and Gas Conference in Kuala Lumpur today. “They will raise
production if there is demand. If there’s an increase in  oil
prices , it is not because of OPEC.”  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
probably leave its output target unchanged on June 8, according
to a Bloomberg survey of 30 analysts conducted May 24-31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
