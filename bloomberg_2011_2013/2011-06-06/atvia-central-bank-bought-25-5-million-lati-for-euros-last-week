Latviaâ€™s central bank bought 25.5
million lati ($52.6 million) for euros last week, the Riga-based
bank said today on its  website .  Latvia, like neighboring  Lithuania , is a member of the pre-
euro exchange-rate mechanism and pegs its currency to the euro.
Latvia keeps the exchange rate within a 1 percent band around a
target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
