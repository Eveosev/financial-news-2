Guy Hands ’s Terra Firma Capital
Partners Ltd. hired former  Citigroup Inc. (C)  banker Kamal Tabet as
head of  investor relations , four months after the U.S. lender
took control of EMI Group Ltd. from the private equity firm.  Tabet was formerly head of a team at Citigroup that advised
private equity firms on acquisitions and raising funds, the
London-based company said in a statement today. He left the New
York-based bank in January 2009, and wasn’t directly involved in
Hands’s purchase of EMI.  Tabet “has had a hugely successful career at senior levels
in international banking, most recently serving the best private
equity firms in the world,” Hands said. “He will make a huge
contribution to the future development of Terra Firma.”  Hands, who bet and lost almost a third of his firm’s 5.4
billion-euro ($7.9 billion) leveraged-buyout fund on EMI, told
investors last months he expects his next fund will at least be
44 percent smaller. Terra Firma last year lost a lawsuit in
which it accused Citigroup of tricking it into overpaying for
EMI in 2007. Citigroup was advising EMI while also providing
debt financing to fund Hands’s offer for the Beatles’ label.  Private equity firms raised $225 billion last year, the
least since 2004 as investors became reluctant to commit money
to new funds before reaping profits from previous investments,
according to London research firm Preqin Ltd.  Tabet, who has worked at Citigroup for 14 years, previously
worked at Lazard Ltd. in  New York  and Republic National Bank of
New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
