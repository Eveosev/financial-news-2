Olam International Ltd. (OLAM)  is offering
to pay as much as 364 basis points more than the London
interbank offered rate for a $1.25 billion loan facility,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  The supplier of food commodities, based in Singapore, has
given banks until July 4 to respond, the person said, asking not
to be identified because the details are private.  Olam is offering an all-in payment of 364 basis points more
than Libor on a five-year portion of the loan, the person said.
A three-year portion will pay an all-in rate of 258 basis points
more than Libor, the person said.  Olam, which is building a $1.3 billion fertilizer plant in
the Republic of Gabon, is expanding its assets with palm-oil
plantations, sugar refineries and wheat milling to meet African
and Asian demand for commodities. It has $2.2 billion of loans
maturing before the end of 2017, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The companyâ€™s shares were placed on a trading halt this
morning in  Singapore  pending an announcement.  Banks contributing to the $1.25 billion facility, which is
in the process of being marketed to other lenders, include
 Australia  and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., Commerzbank AG,
Rabobank International, Credit Suisse Group AG, DBS Bank Ltd.,
Emirates NBD PJSC, HSBC Holdings Plc, ING Groep NV, JPMorgan
Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley, National Australia Bank Ltd.,
Natixis, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Standard Chartered
Plc and UBS AG, according to a May 27 company statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
