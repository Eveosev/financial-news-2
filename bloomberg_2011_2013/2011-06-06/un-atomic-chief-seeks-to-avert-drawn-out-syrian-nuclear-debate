The United Nations nuclear agency
concluded that  Syria  was building a surreptitious nuclear
reactor because inspectors wanted to avert a drawn-out debate
about the site destroyed by an Israeli raid in 2007.  “It was in no one’s interest to let this situation drag on
indefinitely,” International Atomic Energy Agency Director
General Yukiya Amano said today in a statement in Vienna. “I am
confident about our conclusion and I look forward to engaging
further with Syria.”  The IAEA’s 35-member board of governors is meeting this
week in Vienna to discuss Syria’s alleged nuclear cover-up.
While the IAEA found at least four man-made uranium particles at
the site, it abstained from offering a definitive conclusion
before issuing its report May 24.  U.S. intelligence, which suspected Syria of having a covert
nuclear program in the 1990s, was certain the country was
building a secret facility in Dair Alzour with North Korean help
during the first quarter of 2007, according to  congressional
testimony  in April 2008. Syria has alleged that the handful of
uranium particles found at the site came from Israeli munitions
used to destroy the complex. The facility was a conventional
military base, the country told IAEA inspectors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
