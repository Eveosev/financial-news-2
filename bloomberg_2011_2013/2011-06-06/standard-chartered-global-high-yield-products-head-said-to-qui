Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) ’s global head
of high-yield financial products, Sameer Sopori, has left the
bank after less than two years in the job, according to two
people familiar with the matter.  Sopori joined the London-based bank in  Singapore  in
November 2009 and reported to Standard Chartered’s Dubai-based
global head of debt capital markets, Henrik Raber, one of the
people said, asking not to be identified as details are private.  Standard Chartered is the No. 3 arranger of corporate high-
yield bond sales in either dollars, euro or yen in Asia outside
of  Japan  this year with a 9.5 percent market share, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Deutsche Bank AG and Citigroup Inc.
lead the 2011 rankings with shares of 13 percent and 12 percent
respectively, the data show.  Per Nordstrom, the bank’s former Asia head of euro medium-
term notes, based in  Hong Kong , also resigned recently, to join
SEB AB as head of capital markets in the region. Nordstrom
helped with Standard Chartered’s marketing of so-called dim sum
bonds, which are yuan-denominated notes sold in the city.  Valerie Tay, a spokeswoman for Standard Chartered, confirmed
in an e-mail that Sopori had left the bank. Sopori couldn’t be
immediately reached.  To contact the reporter on this story:
