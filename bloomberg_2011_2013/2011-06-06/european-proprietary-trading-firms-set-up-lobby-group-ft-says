Fifteen trading companies that use
their own money to deal in equities, derivatives and foreign-
exchange markets have set up a lobby group called the FIA
European Principal Traders Association, the Financial Times
reported, citing FIA president John Damguard.  The move comes as regulators ponder whether such firms,
which often use “high-frequency trading,” should be subject to
“an appropriate regulatory structure,” the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
