Japanese finance ministry officials
lowered their assessment of the economy for the first quarter,
saying that the record earthquake and tsunami in March hurt
production and consumer spending.  “The economy is showing weakness” because of the disaster,
managers of the finance ministry’s regional branches said in a
quarterly report in  Tokyo  today.  That was the second straight quarter that the overall
evaluation was downgraded, while seven out of 11 regions
including the area around Tokyo cut their assessments, according
to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
