Iraq  will ask Lebanon to hand over
Hussein al-Uzri, the former president and chairman of state-
owned Trade Bank of Iraq, as part of a corruption probe, said
Ali al-Allaq, secretary general of the  Council of Ministers .  Trade Bank of Iraq is under investigation for alleged
irregularities and al-Uzri is facing an arrest warrant issued by
the Iraqi authorities, al-Allaq said in a press conference in
 Baghdad  today. Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki appointed
Hamida al-Jaf to replace him, the bank’s deputy Director-General
Abdel Hadi Sadeq Abdel Mahdi said yesterday.  “We hope the Lebanese government will cooperate with us
and we are sure that he is in Lebanon,” al-Allaq said. “He is
wanted and we will resort to all legal and diplomatic means to
return al-Uzri to Iraq, including the Interpol.”  The irregularities are valued at “millions of dollars, and
we have been following this for more than two years,” he said.  Al-Jaf has 30 years of banking experience and previously
worked at state-owned Rafidain bank. Trade Bank of Iraq is
“working normally and the new administration appointed by the
prime minister is carrying out its duties normally,” al-Allaq
said.  Demonstrations calling for an end to corruption and better
services in Iraq preceded the wave of unrest that has swept
through North Africa and the  Middle East . Berlin-based
 Transparency International , an anti-graft group, placed Iraq in
fourth to last place in its 2010 corruption index of 178
countries.  To contact the reporters on this story:
