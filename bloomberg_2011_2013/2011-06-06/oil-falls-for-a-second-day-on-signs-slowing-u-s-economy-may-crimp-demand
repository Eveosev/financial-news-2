Oil dropped for a second day in  New
York , extending last week’s 0.4 percent decline, on signs of a
slowdown in demand as OPEC ministers arrived in Vienna to
discuss production quotas.  Futures fell as much as 1.4 percent as the highest U.S.
jobless rate this year fueled concern that the recovery in the
world’s largest economy is faltering. The Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries is unlikely to change targets when
it meets June 8, according to a Bloomberg News survey of 30
analysts conducted in the week to May 31.  “We have been stuck in a range for a long time now with
Libyan pressures seemingly passing away,” said Alexander Ridgers, London-based head of commodities at CMC Markets.
“Around $99 seems like the right price. The current data coming
out suggests a falloff in economic activity and a decrease in
demand, but if this happens OPEC will tighten their supply.”  Crude for July delivery dropped as much as $1.41 to $98.81
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $98.83 at 12:51 p.m. London time. Prices are
39 percent higher the past year.  Brent crude  for July delivery lost as much as $1.62, or 1.4
percent, to $114.22 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange, and traded at $114.31 after climbing 30 cents,
or 0.3 percent, on June 3. Prices are 59 percent higher in the
past year.  U.S. Economy  The  unemployment rate  in the U.S. unexpectedly climbed to
9.1 percent in May and payrolls grew at the slowest pace in
eight months, showing employers are losing confidence as the
economy slows. Employers added a less-than-projected 54,000 jobs
last month, after a revised 232,000 gain in April that was
smaller than initially estimated. The median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey called for payrolls to rise 165,000.  The  U.S. trade deficit  probably widened in April to a 10-
month high, reflecting higher crude oil costs that have since
retreated, economists said before a report this week.  OPEC will probably maintain production levels when it
meets, resisting calls to ease the pressure of $100-a-barrel oil
on the global economy, according to a survey of analysts by
Bloomberg News.  OPEC won’t announce any supply increase and will keep its
formal quota unchanged for an eighth consecutive meeting at the
June 8 gathering, 27 of 30 analysts said. Brent crude rallied 22
percent this year as conflict halted Libyan exports. The
 International Energy Agency , an adviser to importing nations,
said on May 19 that there is “an urgent need” for more oil.  Supply Concern  “We don’t expect any changes, but who knows. The market is
still concerned about the supply side,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , London-based vice president of commodities research
at VTB Capital.  Crude at $75 to $80 a barrel is a reasonable price, Shamsul Azhar Abbas, chief executive officer of  Malaysia ’s state oil
company, Petroliam Nasional Bhd., said at the Asia Oil and Gas
Conference in  Kuala Lumpur  today.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators decreased
their net-long position in crude futures in the week ended May
31, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.  Managed money bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 224,441
futures, the Washington-based regulator said in its weekly
Commitments of Traders report. Net long positions fell by 1,236
contracts, or 0.55 percent, from a week earlier.  Keystone Pipeline  TransCanada Corp. started transporting crude through its
591,000 barrel-a-day Keystone pipeline after it was shut because
of a leak, the second unplanned closure in a month. The shutdown
of the pipeline on May 29 helped push the front-month crude
contract in New York to a 20-day high of $103.39 on May 31.  The system resumed oil flows June 5 after the U.S.
Pipelines and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration approved
the company’s restart plan, Calgary-based TransCanada said in a
statement dated yesterday.  The company shut the pipeline on May 29 after a fitting
started leaking at a pump station in Doniphan County,  Kansas ,
about 60 miles (97 kilometers) northwest of  Kansas City ,
 Missouri . The incident spilled less than 10 barrels of oil,
TransCanada said.  Brent traded at a premium of $15.55 a barrel to U.S.
futures, from $15.62 on June 3. The difference between front-
month contracts in  London  and New York reached a record $19.54
on Feb. 21. The spread averaged 76 cents last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
