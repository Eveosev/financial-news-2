Ethanol futures tumbled the most in
three weeks in  Chicago  on signs of a slowing economy and as corn
dropped amid favorable planting weather.  The grain-based additive slumped to the lowest price in
more than two weeks after the most recent U.S. jobless report
showed the  unemployment rate  climbed to the highest level this
year. Separately, dry, warm weather in the U.S. Midwest may help
farmers plant corn, the primary ingredient for ethanol
production.  “It’s just following suit with everything else,” said
Mike Blackford, a consultant at INTL FC Stone Group in  Des
Moines ,  Iowa . “Today it’s more of the outside markets. Planting
is progressing.”  Denatured ethanol for July delivery fell 4.9 cents, or 1.9
percent, to settle at $2.60 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the lowest price since May 17 and the steepest decline
since May 11.  In cash market trading ethanol in Chicago lost 4 cents, or
1.5 percent, to $2.60 a gallon and in  New York  the additive slid
3.5 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $2.70, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf slipped 2 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to $2.755 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel plunged 1.5
cents, or 0.5 percent, to $2.77.  Corn futures for July delivery dropped 22 cents, or 2.9
percent, to $7.32 a bushel in Chicago.  Average ethanol mills in Iowa are losing 9 cents on every
gallon produced, while plants in Illinois are losing 5 cents on
a spot basis, according to Ag Trader Talk, an online grains
information service in Clive, Iowa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
