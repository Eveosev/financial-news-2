Turkiye Petrolleri AO, the Turkish
state oil and gas producer known as TPAO, and other Turkish
companies will seek to get new oil and gas production contracts
from  Iraq ’s fourth round of auctions,  Star  reported, citing
Energy Minister  Taner Yildiz .  Iraq, eager to supply natural gas to its overburdened power
plants, signed agreements with  Korea Gas Corp. (036460) , Kuwait Energy
Co. and TPAO to develop two gas fields.  The three companies already secured rights to develop the
Mansouriya field in Iraq’s eastern Diyala province, while TPAO
and Kuwait Energy won a license for the Siba field in southern
Basra province, Oil Minister Abdul Kareem al-Luaibi said
yesterday. The government awarded rights to both deposits in
October, together with a license to a third field called Akkas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
