Hungary ’s budget overhaul may prompt
credit rating services to raise the country’s debt in the second
half of 2011, news portal  Mfor.hu  reported today, citing Roland Natran, deputy state secretary at the  Economy Ministry .  The increasing confidence among investors that Hungary can
cut its public debt may push the country into a “positive
spiral” that gets reflected in its credit ratings, Natran said
in an interview with Mfor.hu. The market may put pressure on
ratings companies to revise their stance on Hungary in the fall
of this year, Natran said.  The implementation of the program announced this year to
cut spending is going according to schedule, Natran said, adding
that the government is willing to introduce new measures if the
plan doesn’t succeed in reining in the  budget deficit  as much as
expected.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
