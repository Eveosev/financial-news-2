T-Hrvatski Telekom d.d. of  Croatia 
and  Telekom Austria AG (TKA)  were chosen by the Kosovo government as
the finalists for the stake in  Posta dhe Telekomunikacioni i
Kosoves Sh.A. , the country’s state-owned telecommunications
company.  The Croatian operator, majority owned by  Deutsche Telekom
AG (DTE) , and the Austrian phone company, beat rivals including
Orascom Telecom Holdings SAE for as much as 75 percent in the
Kosovo phone company, the country’s Ministry for  Economic
Development  said on its  website .  The sale is part of the Kosovo government’s efforts to
cover this year’s budget spending. The sale may fetch as much
as 600 million euros ($879 million), the ministry has
estimated.  To contact the reporters on this story:
