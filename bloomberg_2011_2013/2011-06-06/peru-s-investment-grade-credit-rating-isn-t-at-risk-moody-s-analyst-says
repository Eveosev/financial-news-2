Peru’s investment-grade credit rating
isn’t at risk from Ollanta Humala, who claimed victory in
yesterday’s presidential elections, and the country’s
fundamentals remain “unbelievably strong,” said Patrick Esteruelas, a senior analyst at the sovereign risk group at
Moody’s Investors Service.  Humala toned down his anti-business rhetoric toward the end
of the campaign season and doesn’t appear poised to seek any
sharp policy changes that would threaten the foundations of the
country’s economy, Esteruelas said in a telephone interview from
 New York .  “Peru’s credit fundamentals are so unbelievably strong to
begin with, which frankly leaves plenty of space for potential
additional upgrades if things were to remain as is,” Esteruelas
said. “Peru has the highest potential growth rate in the
region.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
