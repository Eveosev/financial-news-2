Emanuele Ravano, a managing director
of Pacific Investment Management Co., isn’t convinced by  Spain ’s
savings banks and doesn’t “have a good opinion” about the
risks associated with them, Expansion reported, citing an
interview with him.   Even so, Spain’s debt is in better shape than a year ago
and there will be many investment opportunities this year in
Spain where the big banks are well managed, the newspaper said,
citing Ravano.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
