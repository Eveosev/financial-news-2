Governments must maintain efforts to
toughen global financial regulation and step up efforts to
reduce debt to prevent future crises, European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development President Thomas Mirow said.  “There is still important unfinished business in fixing
those flaws in financial systems that contributed to causing the
crisis,” Mirow said today in  Montreal ,  Canada , according to the
text of a speech distributed by e-mail by the London-based
lender. “Financial lobbies argue that determined regulation,
such as the enforcement of new capital standards, could kill the
sector’s contribution to recovery. I am not convinced by that
argument and I believe that reform is necessary and urgent.”  Mirow also said he sees a risk of a build-up of
“macroeconomic tensions and financial sector distortions” and
warned that governments no longer have the “necessary fiscal
space” to deal effectively with any crisis.  There has been a “very significant increase” in public
debt, limiting governments’ ability for stimulus measures and
bank bailouts, he said. In the euro area, governments must
recognize that “monetary union calls for a degree of fiscal
union” and that there is a need for a convergence in
competitiveness, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
