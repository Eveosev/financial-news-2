OAO Sberbank’s preferred shares
climbed to a seven-week high after Chief Executive Officer
 German Gref  said June 3 the lender may convert some to common
stock.  The preferred shares rallied 2.4 percent to 71.70 rubles by
the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, the highest since April 15.
Sberbank’s ordinary shares rose 0.8 percent to 95.92 rubles.  The preferred stock surged 6.1 percent on June 3, the most
in more than a year, after Gref said Russia’s largest lender is
considering options to reduce its preferred shares.  “We expect the discount to narrow further in the coming
months and see the prefs as the better near-term way to play
Sberbank,” Troika Dialog analysts Andrew Keeley and Olga
Veselova said in an e-mailed report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
