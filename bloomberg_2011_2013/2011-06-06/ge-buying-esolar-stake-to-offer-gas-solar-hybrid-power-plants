General Electric Co. (GE) , the largest
supplier of  wind turbines  in the U.S., plans to purchase a
minority stake in closely held eSolar in a bid to develop power
plants that can use both solar thermal energy and natural gas.  The investment gives GE an exclusive license to sell
eSolarâ€™s solar thermal technology, which it plans to combine
with its energy-efficient gas turbines, Fairfield, Connecticut-
based GE said today in a statement.  Combining the two technologies in a hybrid plant will
increase efficiency of the gas turbines to 70 percent from 61
percent, lowering fuel costs and emissions, GE said. ESolar is
based in Burbank,  California . The companies did not say how
large a stake in eSolar GE will buy or how much it agreed to
pay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
