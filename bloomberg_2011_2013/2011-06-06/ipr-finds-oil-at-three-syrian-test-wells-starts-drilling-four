IPR Mediterranean Exploration Ltd., a
subsidiary of Texas-based Improved Petroleum Recovery Group of
Companies, found oil at three test wells in eastern  Syria .  IPR made discoveries at the Abu Khashab-1, Abu Khashab-2
and South Abu Khashab-1 wells in Block 24, project partner
General Petroleum Corp. said in a statement on its website. The
explorer started drilling the Abu Khashab-3 well on May 30,
General Petroleum said without giving more details.  IPR has produced oil in Syria since 2010 through Al Rasheed
Petroleum Co., a joint venture with Syriaâ€™s state-owned General
Petroleum, according to the statement.  Syria is seeking foreign investment to help stabilize crude
output this year at 386,000 barrels a day, Oil Minister Sufian Alao said in March. Production peaked at 583,000 barrels a day
in 1996 and the country will deplete existing reserves within 18
years, according to calculations by BP Plc.  With assistance from Nayla Razzouk in Amman.--Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
