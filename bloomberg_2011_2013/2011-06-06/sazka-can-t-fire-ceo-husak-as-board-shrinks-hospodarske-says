Sazka AS can’t fire Chief Executive
Officer Ales Husak after the executive board of the bankrupt
lottery company shrank to three members out of seven,
Hospodarske Noviny  reported , citing two members who quit last
week.  Six votes are needed to remove the CEO, the Prague-based
newspaper said. The board now doesn’t have enough members to
summon a general meeting of shareholders who could elect new
board members, according to Hospodarske Noviny.  To contact the reporter on this story:
