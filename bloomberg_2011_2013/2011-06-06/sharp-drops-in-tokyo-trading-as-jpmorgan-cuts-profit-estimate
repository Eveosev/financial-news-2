Sharp Corp.,  Japan ’s largest liquid-
crystal-display maker, fell the most in three weeks in Tokyo
trading after JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut its estimate for profit
on costs related to panel factories.  Sharp dropped as much as 3 percent, the biggest intraday
decline since May 16, to 716 yen, before trading 1.5 percent
lower at 727 yen at the 11 a.m. break on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.8 percent.  The  Osaka , Japan-based company on June 3 forecast an 87
percent gain in operating profit this year to 32 billion yen
($399 million) for its LCD business as it shifts some output to
smaller panels to meet demand for smartphones and tablet
computers. Sharp’s estimate doesn’t include utilization losses
related to suspending operations at two plants in Japan as it
reallocates production, Yoshiharu Izumi, an analyst at JPMorgan,
wrote in a note to clients today.  “We revise our forecast because we count utilization
losses as an operating expense, since overseas LCD companies do
not record utilization losses as extraordinary losses,” Izumi
wrote in the report. He cut his estimate for operating profit
for the year started April 1 to 11 billion yen from an earlier
prediction of 42 billion yen. The company has a forecast of 97
billion yen.  Izumi also reduced his six-month price estimate for Sharp
shares by 8 percent to 690 yen. He estimated utilization losses
would be 27 billion yen at the Sakai plant and 15 billion yen at
the Kameyama facility, as the company temporarily halts output
to shift to smaller panels.  Sharp on June 3 forecast a 69 percent drop in net income to
6 billion yen this fiscal year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
