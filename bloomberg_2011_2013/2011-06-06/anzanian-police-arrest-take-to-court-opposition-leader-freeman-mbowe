Tanzanian police said they arrested
opposition leader Freeman Mbowe.  “We are delivering him in the court in Arusha as per the
wishes of the court,” Advera Senso, a spokeswoman for the
Tanzanian police, said in a phone interview today. She didn’t
provide further details.  A Tanzanian court issued an arrest warrant for Mbowe after
he failed to appear in court on charges of organizing an illegal
gathering earlier this year, the Dar es Salaam-based  Guardian
newspaper  reported on June 3.  Mbowe is chairman of Chama Cha Demokrasia na Manedeleo, the
East African nation’s biggest opposition party.  To contact the reporter on this story:
