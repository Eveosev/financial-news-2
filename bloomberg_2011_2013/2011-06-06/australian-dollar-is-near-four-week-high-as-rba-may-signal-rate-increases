Australia ’s dollar dropped against
the majority of its most-traded counterparts after the central
bank held  interest rates  unchanged and said current policy
settings are appropriate.  The Aussie fell versus the currencies of other commodity
exporters including New Zealand and Canada after  Reserve Bank  of
Australia Governor Glenn Stevens said the decision reflected
“softened” prices for raw materials and a jobless rate that’s
been little changed at almost 5 percent. New Zealand’s dollar
rose as speculation eased that  Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen,
boosting demand for higher-yielding assets.  The RBA statement “sounded a little bit more downbeat than
expected,” said  Mitul Kotecha , head of global foreign-exchange
strategy in  Hong Kong  at Credit Agricole SA. “Gains for the
Aussie dollar will be more difficult in the months ahead.”  Australia’s dollar fell 0.7 percent to NZ$1.3056 at 11:36
a.m. in  New York , from NZ$1.3151 yesterday. It was little
changed against the greenback at $1.0706, and gained less than
0.1 percent to 85.86 yen, from 85.81. The Aussie fell 0.7
percent versus Canada’s dollar to C$1.0440.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, appreciated 0.7
percent to 81.98 U.S. cents, from 81.45. It touched a record
82.64 U.S. cents on May 31. The kiwi advanced 0.8 percent to
65.76 yen, from 65.24.  The Australian central bank kept the overnight cash rate
target at 4.75 percent, as forecast by 23 of 28 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Five had predicted a quarter
percentage-point increase.  Rate Bets Lowered  Swaps traders are betting the RBA will raise the rate by 20
basis points over the next 12 months, down from a forecast
yesterday of 26 basis points, a Credit Suisse Group AG index
showed. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The kiwi rose after the European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet yesterday gave his first signal that he
endorses encouraging investors to buy new Greek bonds to replace
maturing securities, potentially making the euro region’s
sovereign-debt situation more sustainable.  To contact the reporter on this story:
