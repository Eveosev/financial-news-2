The risk of owning U.S. government
debt is as great as any time since the 1950s with yields at the
year’s lows and Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  locking
in borrowing costs by selling longer-term securities.  Yields on Treasuries would only need to rise 0.3 percentage
point over one year on average from 1.67 percent to produce a
loss, based on the benchmark Barclays Treasury index, a study by
Los Angeles-based First Pacific Advisors shows. The last time
bonds were close to this level was in March 2009, when a 0.43
percentage point rise in yields would have left holders of
comparable maturity five-year Treasuries with losses.  “You have to go back into the 1950s to find this kind of
activity,” said Thomas Atteberry, who manages $3.7 billion in
fixed income assets at First Pacific in  Los Angeles . “Interest-
rate risk is the most acute it’s been in an extremely long time.
I have to stay short, five years and in.”  By shifting more of the risk of higher interest rates onto
investors as it increases the average maturity of  U.S. debt , the
Treasury risks damping demand at bond auctions needed to finance
the government’s $1.3 trillion  budget deficit . The average due
date of the $9.1 trillion of marketable debt outstanding rose to
60 months in March from a 24-year low of 49 months in 2008.  “For new money that comes in today, there isn’t much of a
cushion,” said James Sarni, senior managing partner at Los
Angeles-based Payden & Rygel, which manages $50 billion. “The
risk of losing money is, I believe, quite substantial.”  Yields Fall  Bonds rallied last week as reports showed manufacturing in
May expanded at the slowest pace in 20 months, unemployment rose
to 9.1 percent and  consumer confidence  fell to a six-month low.  The yield on the benchmark five-year note was little
changed at 1.59 percent at 7 a.m. in New York after falling 12
basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, last week. The price of
the 1.75 percent security due in May 2016 rose 18/32 in the five
days to June 3, or $5.63 per $1,000 face amount, to 100 23/32,
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices show. Ten-year yields dropped 9
basis points to 2.99 percent last week after reaching 2.94
percent on June 1, the lowest since Dec. 6.  The median estimate of 70 economists and strategist
surveyed by Bloomberg News is for the 10-year yield to rise to
3.8 percent by year-end. Investors in the security would lose
4.63 percent, Bloomberg data show, because prices of bonds with
longer maturities are typically more vulnerable to movements in
 interest rates  since their payments extend over a greater
period.  ‘Sweet Spot’  Holders of two-year notes would lose about 1.02 percent if
the yield climbs to the median estimate of 1.33 percent from
0.42 percent on June 3. The price of the notes would fall about
$13 per $1,000 to 98 27/32 from 100 5/32, exceeding the $5 in
annual interest on the security.  Allstate Corp., which manages $80.2 billion in fixed-income
assets, and Loews Corp.’s CNA Financial Corp. unit, which
oversees $38 billion of bonds, said they are shifting to
intermediate maturities given the risk to the principal of
longer-term securities.  “What we’re focused on is maintaining yields in the
portfolio and optimizing interest-rate risk,” Judy Greffin,
Northbrook, Illinois-based Allstate’s chief investment officer,
said on a June 1 conference call with analysts.  Medium-term bonds are “basically the sweet spot for us,”
James Tisch, chief executive officer of Loews, said June 3 at a
conference in  New York . “It provides us protection in case
interest rates continue to decline, but likewise if interest
rates rise it provides us a steady cash flow of both cash and
maturing investments so we can then reinvest at the higher
rates.”  Elevated Demand  Of the $2.249 trillion of notes and bonds sold by the
Treasury in 2010, 38 percent or $851 billion were of maturities
of more than five years, compared with 25 percent or $231
billion of the $922 billion sold in 2008. Demand has increased
as sales continue at a near-record pace. The Treasury has
received $3 in bids for every dollar auctioned this year,
compared with last year’s record $2.99, government data show.
The U.S. has sold $895 billion of notes and bonds in 2011,
versus $1.003 trillion at this time in 2010.  Yields on 10-year notes are 2.2 percentage points below the
average over the past 20 years and about half the average since
1953, when President Dwight Eisenhower began his administration.  Eisenhower Recessions  The yield remained below 3 percent from the third quarter
of 1953 through the second quarter of 1956, and dipped below
that level again in 1958 as Eisenhower grappled with an economy
that fell into a 10-month recession in 1953, an eight-month
contraction in 1957 and another 10-month slowdown in 1960.  Bond yields began a 20-year climb after the end of the last
Eisenhower recession in 1961, reaching a peak at 15.8 percent in
1981 as Fed Chairman  Paul Volcker  raised the central bank’s
target rate for overnight loans between banks to 20 percent to
contain surging inflation.  While the risk of holding bonds may be the same as the
1950s, new financial products derived from Treasuries may raise
the danger level, according to  David Jones , 72, former vice
chairman of Aubrey G. Lanston & Co. The firm was one of the
original primary dealers that are obligated to bid at Treasury
auctions.  “We now have a Treasury bond market that is global and we
have so many different categories of debt and derivatives that
you can almost make no comparison,” Jones said. “It lends a
lot of volatility to the Treasury yield we never had before when
it was a much more domestically focused market.”  Inflation Speculation  This year’s rally led  James Kochan , who helps manage $231
billion as chief fixed-income strategist at Wells Fargo Fund
Management LLC in  Menomonee Falls ,  Wisconsin , to stop advocating
the purchase of long-term  U.S. government debt . Yields on
Treasuries due in 10 years or sooner are all less than the 3.2
percent increase in the  consumer price index  in the 12 months
ended April 30.  “You’ve got a lot more risk in this market now,” Kochan
said. “If I had to own Treasuries here I’d be coming in on the
curve,” buying shorter-term notes, he said. “This rally’s
overdone.”  Yields have declined as government and private measures of
economic growth have fallen below economist forecasts, boosting
speculation inflation may slow and make bonds more valuable.  The  Institute for Supply Management  said June 1 that its
factory index plunged to 53.5 in May from 60.4 the prior month.
A day earlier, the Conference Board’s confidence index dropped
to 60.8 from a revised 66 reading in April.  Employers added a fewer-than-projected 54,000 jobs last
month, the Labor Department said June 3. The median forecast in
a Bloomberg News survey called for payrolls to rise by 165,000.  Growth Forecast  Economists at Barclays Capital Inc. cut their forecast for
second-quarter economic growth on June 3 to a 2 percent annual
rate from a prior estimate of 3.5 percent. They lowered their
projection for the third quarter to 3 percent from 3.5 percent.  Even with the economy slow, the potential for losses on
Treasuries is too great to make the securities attractive after
yields fell to the lowest this year, according to David Brownlee, head of fixed income at Sentinel Asset Management in
Montpelier,  Vermont , which manages $28 billion.  “We’ve been liquidating Treasuries,” Brownlee said.
“It’s not that we hate them as an asset class, but we’ve been
looking at more short-term mortgage backed securities.”  ‘Close to a Floor’  Treasuries have returned 2.85 percent on average this year,
including reinvested interest, according to bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data. Mortgage securities returned 3 percent
on average.  The rally is dependent on the economy falling back into
recession, said Krishna Memani, director of fixed income at
OppenheimerFunds Inc. in New York, who helps manage $70 billion.  If the market gets improving data in the U.S. and signs of
stabilization in  Japan  and  Europe  “I can see rates rising 50 to
60 basis points fairly quickly,” Memani said. “We are getting
quite close to a floor in Treasury yields.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
