Ukraine’s inflation accelerated in
June to the fastest pace since December 2009 as utility and food
costs increased, undermining government efforts to keep
consumer-price growth below 10 percent for a second year.  Consumer prices advanced 11.9 percent from a year earlier,
compared with 11 percent in May, the government’s statistics
service in Kiev said today on its  website . That matched the
median estimate of 10 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Prices
rose 0.4 percent in the month, compared with 0.8 percent in May.  Ukraine raised natural-gas prices for households by 50
percent last August and promised the  International Monetary Fund 
it would increase them again in 2011 to meet conditions for a
$15.2 billion bailout approved last year. The government also
lifted electricity prices by 30 percent from February.  Producer prices, an early indicator of inflation trends,
rose 20 percent from a year earlier and advanced 0.5 percent in
the month, the statistics committee said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
