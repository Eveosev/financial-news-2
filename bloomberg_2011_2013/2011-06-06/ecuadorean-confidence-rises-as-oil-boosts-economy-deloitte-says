Ecuador  business confidence rose to
its highest level in two months as the price of crude, the
nation’s biggest export, traded higher than government
forecasts, spurring economic growth, Deloitte & Touche LLP said.  An index measuring company confidence in Ecuador rose to
84.5 last month from 76.2 in April out of a possible 250, the
research firm’s  Quito office  said today in a report. A year ago,
Ecuador’s business confidence registered 81.6 points, the survey
said.  Ecuador, the smallest member of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, has seen prices for its Oriente
crude rise to about $100 a barrel this year, 36 percent higher
than the $73.30 forecast in the  Finance Ministry ’s 2011 budget.
The windfall profits from oil, which provides the government
with about 24 percent of its revenue, will allow President
 Rafael Correa  to cover “most” of the nation’s estimated $3.7
billion  budget deficit  and boost spending on roads, bridges and
hydroelectric dams, economist Walter Spurrier, director of
Guayaquil-based economic research company Grupo Spurrier, said
in a May 31 speech in Quito.  “Among the positive factors, those with the largest impact
are the high price of oil, lower unemployment and stability in
macroeconomic data,” Deloitte said in the report. These
“permit sustained vigor in the economy.”  Deloitte didn’t publish the number of survey participants
or report a margin of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
