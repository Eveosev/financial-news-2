The  Iran  Mercantile Exchange has
started trading fuel oil in the Persian Gulfâ€™s island of Kish,
according to the  Fars   news agency .  Fuel oil totaling about 35,000 metric tons was offered on
June 1 on the free trade zone at a base price of $621.35 a ton,
the report published today on the state-run news agency showed.
Payments will be made in euros and dirham through accounts held
overseas under the supervision of the National Iranian Oil Co.,
it said, without specifying details of the transactions.  Iran, the second-largest crude producer in the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries, aims to revive its mostly
government-controlled economy and expand its influence in energy
markets in the  Middle East . The country is constrained by
international economic and financial sanctions over its nuclear
program, which complicates trading for foreign companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
