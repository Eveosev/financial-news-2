AS Eesti Krediidipank is majority
owned by offshore companies registered in Cyprus and the British
Virgin Islands after a string of transactions beginning in
December,  Aeripaeev  reported, citing data from regulators.  Fifty-four percent of the Estonian lender, formerly
majority owned by Bank of Moscow, is held by seven offshore
companies after eight transactions, each with stakes just below
10 percent, the newspaper said.  Ownership exceeding 10 percent is considered significant
and requires a specific clearance from the regulator. Estoniaâ€™s
Financial Supervision Authority is still investigating the
transactions, the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
