Shipments from Richards Bay Coal
Terminal,  Africa ’s largest export terminal for the fuel, fell 22
percent in May from a year earlier after railway maintenance
work and a decline in coal prices.  The terminal shipped 3.57 million metric tons, compared
with 4.57 million tons a year earlier and 4.81 million tons in
the previous month, according to Bloomberg calculations based on
statistics e-mailed by RBCT today. Stocks rose to 4.41 million
tons at the end of May from 3.63 million tons in April.  State-owned Transnet Ltd. is carrying out maintenance on
its Richards Bay railroad line, the main feed to the terminal on
 South Africa ’s east coast, from May 23 to June 11.  Terminal owners including  Anglo American Plc (AAL) ,  BHP Billiton
Ltd. (BHP)  and  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  saw coal prices decline 1.6 percent to
average $121.29 a ton in May from $123.25 in April, according to
data by Hampshire-based IHS McCloskey on Bloomberg.  RBCT received 4.41 million tons in May, when 560 trains
delivered coal. The terminal shipped 63.4 million tons in 2010,
when it finished an expansion of capacity to 91 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
