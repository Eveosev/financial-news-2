Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) , the largest U.S.
chemicals manufacturer, and  Aksa Akrilik Kimya Sanayii (AKSA)  AS, a
Turkish maker of synthetic acrylic fibers, are in talks to form
a joint venture to make carbon fiber and derivatives, the
companies said.  Dow and Istanbul-based Aksa signed an accord to “examine
opportunities to develop and market a broad range of products
and technical service offerings in the carbon fiber-based
composites industry,” the companies said today in a statement.  The manufacturers will work on products aimed at
“increasing the energy capture of wind turbines, improving the
fuel economy of automobiles, and extending the life of roads and
buildings,” Andrew Liveris, chairman and chief executive
officer of Midland, Michigan-based Dow, said in the statement.  Aksa planned to double its annual carbon fiber production
to 3,000 tons in 2010, Chairman Mehmet Ali Berkman said last
year. That compares with total global carbon fiber production
capacity of 30,000 tons a year, he said. The fibers are used in
ships, planes,  wind turbines , sports equipment and other
products.  Aksa is the world’s largest producer of acrylic fiber, with
more than 13 percent of the worldwide market, the Turkish
company said in the statement. The manufacturer had revenue of
about $850 million last year and expects to exceed $900 million
this year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
