(Corrects first paragraph to show crude fell.)  Abu Dhabiâ€™s Murban crude fell on
speculation that the highest official selling price in almost
three years relative to Dubai oil may cut demand from refiners.  Murban crude for immediate loading declined 22 cents, or
0.2 percent, to $113.24 barrel, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Dubai oil for loading in August shrank 17 cents cents
to $108.44. Oman dropped 18 cents to $108.90.  Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. set the May official price for
Murban crude at $113.60 a barrel, the company said in notices to
buyers last week. That means the grade is at a premium of $5.22
to Dubai for the same period, the most since July 2008,
according to Bloomberg calculations.  The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps for July narrowed 19
cents to $6.33 a barrel, PVM said. The exchange for swaps for
August increased 5 cents to $6.32 a barrel.  Oman futures for August delivery fell $1.24 to $109.03 a
barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 6:16 p.m. Singapore
time, with 882 contracts traded. The settlement price was at
$108.57 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
