The Pittsburgh Pirates selected
 University of California , Los Angeles pitcher Gerrit Cole with
the No. 1 overall selection in Major League Baseballâ€™s first-
year player draft.   Cole, a junior right-hander, had a 6-8 record with a 3.31
earned run average for  UCLA  this season, with 119 strikeouts and
24 walks in 114 1/3 innings. He went 2-0 with a 0.72 ERA in 25
innings for Team USA in 2010 and was 11-4 with a 3.37 ERA as a
sophomore with the Bruins.   Cole is the fourth pitcher drafted No. 1 in the past six
years, following Stephen Strasburg by Washington in 2009,  David Price  by Tampa Bay in 2007 and Luke Hochevar by  Kansas City  in
2006. The Pirates last had the top overall pick in 2002, when
they drafted pitcher Bryan Bullington, who appeared in 26 major-
league games including six for Pittsburgh.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
