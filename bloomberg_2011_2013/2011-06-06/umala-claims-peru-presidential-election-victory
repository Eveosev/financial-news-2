 Peruvian opposition presidential
candidate Ollanta Humala claimed victory in today’s runoff over
Congresswoman Keiko Fujimori.  Humala, speaking to reporters in  Lima , said exit polls and
official results indicate that he will be elected President  Alan
Garcia ’s successor.  “This economic growth will be the great motor of social
improvement,” Humala said.  Humala won 50.1 percent compared with 49.9 percent for
Fujimori, after 78 percent of votes were counted. The tally
corresponded to 12 million votes counted nationwide and abroad,
most of them in Lima and other urban areas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
