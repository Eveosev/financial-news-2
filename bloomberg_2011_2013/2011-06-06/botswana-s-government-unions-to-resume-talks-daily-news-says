Botswana’s government agreed to
resume talks with labor unions to end a strike by state
employees that is in its eighth week, the Daily News reported.  The agreement came after the Botswana Council of Churches
called both sides to a church service yesterday, the state-owned
newspaper said.  The minister for presidential affairs, Mokgweetsi Masisi,
said he was confident the dispute could be resolved, while
Masego Mogwera, president of the Botswana Federation of Public
Sector Unions, said the strike had gone on too long, according
to the Daily News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
