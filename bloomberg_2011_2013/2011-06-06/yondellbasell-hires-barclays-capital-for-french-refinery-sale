LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB)  hired
 Barclays Plc (BARC)  to help with the sale of its Berre oil refinery
in southern  France , according to an e-mailed statement today.  Last week, the Rotterdam-based company said it’s seeking a
buyer for the 105,000 barrel-a-day plant because it hadn’t
“fulfilled economic projections” made when the site was
acquired from Royal Dutch Shell Plc in 2008. LyondellBasell will
keep its chemicals operations at Berre.  Refiners such as Total SA and Petroplus Holdings AG are
cutting capacity in response to declining profits from
processing crude and falling demand for fuels such as gasoline.  The Berre refinery may fetch $500 million based on the
price PetroChina Co. paid in January for a 50 percent stake in
two refineries owned by Ineos Group Holdings Plc,  Hassan Ahmed ,
an analyst at Alembic Global Advisors, said May 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
