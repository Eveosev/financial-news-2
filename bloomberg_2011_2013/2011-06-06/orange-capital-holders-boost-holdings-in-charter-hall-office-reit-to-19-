Orange Capital LLC, Luxor Capital
Group LP and Point Lobos Capital LLC have increased their stake
in  Charter Hall Office REIT (CQO)  to 19.06 percent from 18.15 percent,
according to a regulatory filing.  Charter Hall Group (CHC) , the REIT’s manager, has rejected the
funds’ call for the trust to consider selling its Australian
assets, appoint additional independent directors and return
excess cash and proceeds from the sale of its U.S. assets to
shareholders, Orange said in a media release.  Orange last week requested a copy of Charter Hall Office’s
unitholder registry to call a shareholder vote to remove the
trust’s manager after failing to reach agreement on a sale of
all its assets. Apollo Global Management LLC and Broadway
Partners offered to buy Charter Hall Office’s U.S. real estate
holdings for more than $1.68 billion, the value the Sydney-based
company put on the assets last year, three people with knowledge
of the bid said last week.  Charter Hall has, through its advisers, been seeking to
acquire shares owned by the funds to prevent a shareholder vote,
Orange said today. The Australian Financial Review today
reported that the funds had approached Charter Hall adviser
Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty to buy out their A$320
million investment, without saying where it got the information.  Charter Hall spokeswoman Kylie Ramsden didn’t immediately
respond to a voicemail message seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
