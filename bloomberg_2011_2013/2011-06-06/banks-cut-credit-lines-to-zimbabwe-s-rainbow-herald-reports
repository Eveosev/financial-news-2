Rainbow Tourism Group (RTG)  Ltd. has lost
access to credit after it was suspended from the Zimbabwe Stock
Exchange, the state-controlled  Herald  said, citing the company’s
Chief Executive Officer Chipo Mtasa.  Banks cut the company’s lines of credit immediately after
Rainbow’s suspension from the Harare-based exchange on May 12,
the Herald cited Mtasa as saying on its website. Finance
Minister Tendai Biti ordered the suspension because of
“irregular” transactions between RTG and Zimbabwe’s
Renaissance Merchant Bank (Private) Ltd, said the Herald, adding
that Rainbow denied knowledge of any wrongdoing.  Renaissance, which owns 26 percent of Rainbow Tourism, was
placed under central bank supervision on June 3 over debts it
has accrued. Rainbow Tourism owns hotels and lodges in  Zimbabwe ,
Zambia and  Mozambique .  To contact the reporter on this story:
