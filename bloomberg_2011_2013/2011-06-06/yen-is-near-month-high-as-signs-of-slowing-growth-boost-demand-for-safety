The yen traded within 0.2 percent of
a one-month high against the dollar on speculation the global
economic recovery is slowing, spurring demand for the Japanese
currency as a refuge.  Switzerland ’s franc was 0.3 percent from a record high
versus the greenback before reports today and tomorrow that may
show a U.S. index of economic optimism fell in June and German
exports declined in April. The Dollar Index held onto
yesterday’s gain on prospects that Asian equities will extend a
global slide, prompting investors to reduce holdings of higher-
yielding assets.  “Mounting worries about a global economic slowdown are
weighing on risk appetite,” said  Mike Jones , a currency
strategist at Bank of New Zealand Ltd. in Wellington. “This may
cause ‘safe-haven’ currencies such as the yen and the Swiss
franc to outperform.”  The yen traded at 80.13 per dollar as of 8:26 a.m. in  Tokyo 
from 80.10 in  New York  yesterday, when it rose to 79.98, the
highest level since May 5.  Japan ’s currency was at 116.88 per
euro from 116.75. The euro was at $1.4586 from $1.4576
yesterday, when it touched $1.4658, the strongest since May 5.  The franc bought 83.51 centimes per dollar from 83.46
yesterday, when it rose to an all-time high of 83.28. The Dollar
Index, which tracks the greenback against the currencies of six
major U.S. trading partners, fetched 73.988 from 73.989
yesterday, when it reached 73.640, the weakest since May 5.  An index of U.S. economic optimism fell to 42.0 in June
from 42.8 in May, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
economists before today’s report. A reading over 50 indicates a
positive outlook.  Germany ’s exports, adjusted for work days and seasonal
changes, dropped 3 percent in April from March, when they rose
7.3 percent, a separate Bloomberg survey showed. The  Federal
Statistics Office  in Wiesbaden releases the data tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
