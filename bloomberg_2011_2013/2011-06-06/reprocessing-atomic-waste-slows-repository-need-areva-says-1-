Creating a facility to reprocess
spent nuclear fuel would put off for 50 years the need to open a
permanent waste repository, the head of Areva SA’s U.S unit
said.  A U.S. recycling plant proposed by the company, which may
cost $20 billion to $30 billion, would postpone debate over
reviving an abandoned facility at Yucca Mountain in  Nevada ,
Jacques Besnainou, chief executive officer of Areva Inc., said
today at a breakfast in  Washington .  “This would delay the decision on Yucca for 50 years,”
Besnainou said.  Areva, based in Paris and the world’s largest supplier of
nuclear equipment, already recycles spent nuclear fuel in
 Europe . The U.S. reprocessing facility, which may be operating
by 2025, would create thousands of jobs in the community where
it is built, Besnainou said.  President  Barack Obama  in 2009 decided to cancel funding
for Yucca Mountain, and named a panel to develop alternatives.
The 15-member  Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future 
has studied storage options and is scheduled to release a draft
report July 29.  A commission subcommittee said in May that the panel should
urge one or more temporary sites for nuclear waste. Such
facilities would store fuel for about 100 years, giving
officials time to determine whether to recycle used fuel or move
it to a permanent site, according to a subcommittee report.  “An interim storage facility is kicking the can down the
road,” Besnainou said.  House Republicans  proposed last week allocating $35 million
from the 2012 federal budget for Yucca Mountain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
