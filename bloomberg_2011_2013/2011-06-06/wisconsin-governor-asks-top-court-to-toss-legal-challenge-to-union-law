Wisconsin Governor  Scott Walker ’s
administration will ask the state’s highest court to take over
and then dismiss a legal challenge to legislation limiting
public employees’ ability to engage in collective bargaining.  The Wisconsin Supreme Court today is hearing arguments from
lawyers for the administration, the state prosecutor who
challenged the legality of the law and the trial court judge who
last month ruled the measure was the improper product of a state
open-meetings law violation.  “The public interest in compliance with the open meetings
law outweighs any public interest there might be in sustaining
the validity of the action taken,” Dane County state court
Judge Maryann Sumi said in her May 26 ruling striking down the
law.  Walker, a first-term Republican, signed the challenged
legislation on March 11. It requires annual recertification
votes for public employees’ union representation and makes their
payment of membership dues voluntary.  The cases are State, ex-rel Ozanne v. Fitzgerald,
2011AP613; and State v. Circuit Court for  Dane County ,
2011AP765, Wisconsin Supreme Court (Madison).  To contact the reporters on this story:
