The  Czech Republic ’s benchmark equity
index fell for a fourth day as deepening concern the U.S.
recovery is slowing damped investor appetite for riskier assets.  The PX gauge of 15 companies retreated 0.5 percent to
1,225.5 at 4:28 p.m. in  Prague , its lowest close in seven weeks.
 CEZ AS (CEZ) , the country’s biggest power producer, dropped 1.1
percent to 889.9 koruna, its lowest since April 19.  Erste Group
Bank AG (EBS)  slid 0.7 percent to 837.1 koruna.  Stocks fell globally after American manufacturing and labor
data last week added to speculation the world’s largest economy
may be faltering. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index retreated
today for a fourth day and Stoxx  Europe  600 Index slipped 0.7
percent.  “The eagerly awaited data from the labor market in the end
delivered a negative surprise,” Ondrej Moravansky, an analyst
at Cyrrus brokerage in Brno, Czech Republic, wrote in a report
to clients today. “European stock markets also started the week
with a decline.”  Fortuna Entertainment Group NV (FORTUNA)  traded without the right to
a 0.3 euro-per-share dividend, according to a company statement
on May 26. The stock fell 6.7 percent to 125 koruna. Adjusting
for the payout, the shares traded 1.3 percent lower.  To contact the reporter on this story:
