Israel ’s 10-year bonds gained as a
decline in global stocks bolstered demand for the relative
safety of government assets amid concern about the pace of
economic growth in the U.S.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index retreated for a fourth day
and oil declined after weaker-than-forecast reports on U.S.
manufacturing, employment and consumer confidence last week led
traders to raise bets the Federal Reserve will keep rates near
zero. The  Tel Aviv 25 Index (TA-25)  of the country’s 25 biggest
companies fell 0.1 percent to 1,229.20 at the 4:30 p.m. close in
Tel Aviv. Earlier, the benchmark lost as much as 0.5 percent.  “There is negative sentiment in the market spurred by a
slump in stocks on bets the pace of recovery in the  U.S. economy 
will be slower than expected and that  interest rates  will remain
low,” Yaron Chechik, a trader at Financial Immunities Ltd. in
Rehovot, Israel, said today by telephone. "Investors are moving
out of stocks into safer assets."  The yield on the benchmark Mimshal Shiklit due January 2020
fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.07 percent
at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv. The shekel depreciated for
the first time in more than a week, retreating 0.1 percent to
3.3720 per dollar at 5:16 p.m.  U.S. payrolls grew at the slowest pace in eight months in
May and the unemployment rate unexpectedly climbed to 9.1
percent from 9 percent in April, Labor Department figures
released on June 3 showed. The  Federal Reserve  has said it will
hold interest rates at record lows for an “extended period.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
