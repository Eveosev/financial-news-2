BNP Paribas (BNP)  and its Turkish unit,
 Turk Ekonomi Bankasi AS (TEBNK) , will be the title sponsors of the year-
ending tournament for women’s tennis.  The agreement will last three years, through the 2013
final, the WTA, the organizer of women’s tennis, said today in
an e-mailed statement. The event brings together the top eight
female singles players and top four doubles teams, who will
compete for $5 million in prize money.  It’s the fifth large agreement signed by the WTA in the
past 12 months. Sony Ericsson is the sport’s lead global
sponsor, and cosmetics maker Oriflame, Chinese clothes maker
Peak and Qantas Airways Ltd.’s Jetstar subsidary signed new
agreements. Usana, a vitamin maker, renewed its sponsorship.  TEB is among the top 10 banks in  Turkey , and has more than
3 million clients at its 600 branches, the WTA said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
