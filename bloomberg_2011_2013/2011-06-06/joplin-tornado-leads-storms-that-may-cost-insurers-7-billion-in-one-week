Insurers may face U.S. storm claims
of as much as $7 billion from a single week last month, led by
costs from the tornado that struck Joplin,  Missouri , modeling
firm AIR Worldwide said.  Insured losses to homes, businesses and cars in the week
ended May 27 will probably be $4 billion to $7 billion, the
Boston-based firm said in an e-mailed statement today. More than
500 people have been  killed  from tornadoes this year, including
at least 130 in Joplin.  State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. and  Allstate
Corp. (ALL) , the largest U.S. home and auto insurers, are among
companies coping with costs from natural disasters this quarter.
The  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  reported
that 1,429 tornadoes had been reported in the U.S. through June
2, compared with 1,282 in all of 2010.  “More than 150 confirmed tornadoes raged across the heart
of the country” from May 20 to May 27, said Tim Doggett,
principal scientist at AIR Worldwide, in a statement.
“Thousands of buildings were damaged, hundreds more were
completely destroyed, and more than a thousand people were
injured.”  State Farm paid $916 million in claims from storms this
quarter, the policyholder-owned insurer said May 27.
Catastrophes, including tornadoes in  Alabama , cost Allstate $1.4
billion in April, the Northbrook, Illinois-based company said
before the Joplin storms. U.S. storms in the week ended April 28
cost $3.7 billion to  $5.5 billion , AIR said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
