Saudi Aramco , the world’s largest
crude exporter, increased its natural-gas production by 6.3
percent last year as local demand increased.  Gas output climbed to 3.4 trillion cubic feet from 3.2
trillion cubic feet a year earlier, Aramco said today in its
2010 annual review.  The Arab country’s gas reserves grew 3.8 trillion cubic
feet to 279 trillion cubic feet at the end of 2010, Aramco said.
The company plans to boost production capacity to 15 billion
cubic feet a day from 10 billion over the next five years to
meet growing local demand and cut crude use in power production.  Aramco discovered four new  oil fields  and a  gas field  in
al-Jalamid in the northern part of the kingdom during the year
and added six new oil reservoirs and three gas reservoirs to
existing fields, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
