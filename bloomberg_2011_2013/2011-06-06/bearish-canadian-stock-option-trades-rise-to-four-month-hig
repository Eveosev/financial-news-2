Trading of U.S. options to protect
against a retreat in Canadian stocks jumped to a four-month high
in the U.S. as the nation’s benchmark erased its 2011 gain amid
a decline in  oil prices .  Volume for puts to sell to sell the  iShares MSCI Canada
Index Fund (EWC)  rose to 1,550 contracts, 14 times the four-week
average and 55 times the number of calls to buy. The U.S.
exchange-traded fund tracking 100 Canadian companies fell a
fourth day, slumping 1.7 percent to $31.32 as of 4 p.m. in New
York. Canada’s Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index decreased
1.5 percent.  Almost all of the put volume was concentrated in the
September $31 puts. Those contracts had an open interest of 95
contracts before today, while 61 percent of today’s trades were
on the ask price, indicating that buyers of new bearish
positions initiated most of today’s transactions. The ETF hasn’t
closed below $31 since January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
