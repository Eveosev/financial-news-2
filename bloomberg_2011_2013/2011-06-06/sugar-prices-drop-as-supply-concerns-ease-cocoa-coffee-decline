Sugar fell in  New York  on
expectations that tight global supplies will ease next season.
Cocoa and coffee also dropped.  Sugar supplies will exceed demand by 10.3 million metric
tons in the year that begins in October, reversing a 500,000-ton
deficit this crop year, as producers respond to higher prices,
according to C. Czarnikow Sugar Futures Ltd. Production will
rise by 14.2 million tons to a record 182.2 million, helping
consumers replenish inventories, the broker said.  “The supply situation is looking comfortable,” said
Marius Sonnen, the president of Sonnen & Co., a New York-based
sugar trader. “There may be some short-term delays because of
port congestions, but a  bumper crop  in  Brazil  will help wipe out
the global deficit.”  Raw sugar for July delivery slid 0.36 cent, or 1.5 percent,
to settle at 23.59 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York. The most-active contract has slumped 35 percent
from a 30-year high of 36.08 cents reached in February.  In  Thailand , vessels were lining up to load as much as
400,000 tons of sugar because of port congestion, according to
Thai Sugar Trading Corp. About 2.25 million tons were waiting to
be loaded at Brazil’s main ports last week, data from shipping
agency Williams Servicos Maritimos Ltda showed.  Cocoa futures for July delivery dropped $15, or 0.5
percent, to $2,863 a ton on ICE.  Arabica-coffee futures for July delivery fell 10.45 cents,
or 3.9 percent, to $2.605 a pound in New York, the most since
March 10.  In  London , refined sugar advanced, while cocoa and robusta
coffee retreated.  To contact the reporters on this story:
