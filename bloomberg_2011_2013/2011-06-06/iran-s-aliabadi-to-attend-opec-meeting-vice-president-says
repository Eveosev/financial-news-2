Iran ’s Mohammad Aliabadi, appointed
last week by President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  as the nation’s
acting oil minister, will represent the nation when OPEC members
meet this week, the ministry’s news website  Shana  said.  Aliabadi, former head of Iran’s Physical Education
Organization, will participate in the June 8 OPEC meeting, Vice
President Mohammad Reza Rahimi said today, according to Shana.  Iran, the second-biggest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries after  Saudi Arabia , holds the
group’s rotating presidency this year.  Ahmadinejad appointed Aliabadi as a caretaker for the oil
ministry on June 2, a day after Iran’s parliament voted to ask
the courts to review whether the president broke the law by
failing to appoint a temporary oil minister after he fired the
previous one and put himself in charge.  Ahmadinejad sacked the country’s oil minister, Masoud Mir- Kazemi, in a reshuffle on May 14. He appointed himself one day
later as the country’s oil caretaker, a move that was criticized
by local industry experts and described on May 20 as
“unlawful” by the Guardian Council, Iran’s top legal
authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
