Helical Bar Plc (HLCL) , a U.K. real-estate
developer, has put on hold a plan to create office campuses for
public-sector bodies in which facilities, accommodation and
services would be shared, the Financial Times reported.  The decision results from a government freeze on property
moves by state organizations, the newspaper said.  The company formed a joint venture called Helical Governetz
with former civil servants in 2007 after consultants recommended
shifting employees out of  London  and out of buildings that were
inefficient and poorly located, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
