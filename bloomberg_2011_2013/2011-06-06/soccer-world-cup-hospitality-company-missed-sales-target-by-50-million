The company that held the corporate
hospitality rights to soccer’s World Cup in  South Africa  missed
its break-even sales target by about $50 million, a director
said.  Match Hospitality AG  agreed to pay soccer ruling body FIFA
$120 million for the rights to the 32-nation event and got $292
million in sales, after forecasting $340 million, according to
director Enrique Byrom, co-founder of U.K.-based Byrom Plc,
Match Hospitality’s biggest investor.  “We lost in South Africa,” Byrom said in an interview
without quantifying the loss. “It was a very difficult market
to sell.”  Last year was the first time the tournament was held in
Africa since the World Cup began in 1930. The location, as well
as trying to sell to businesses during the worst economic crisis
since the Great Depression, meant sales failed to meet
expectations, Byrom said.  The next  World Cup  will take place in  Brazil  in 2014. Match
has forecast sales of $500 million and early indications are
that the target will be met, Byrom said.  “We have a 70 percent higher commitment than for the same
time before the previous tournament,” he said. Hospitality
rights for Brazil also cost $120 million.  FIFA in an e-mailed statement also said “there is a very
demanding market” for the 2014 World Cup.  The U.S. market is showing the strongest interest in
Brazil. Byrom said its American partner SportsMark has booked
$45 million in sales, compared with $15 million for South
Africa. The biggest factor in sales is which nations qualify, he
added.  FIFA said it will begin working on its offering for the
2018 and 2022 World Cups after the tournament in Brazil.  The other partners in Match Hospitality are Infront Sports
& Media AG,  Dentsu Inc. (4324)  and  Bidvest Group Ltd. (BVT)   The draw for the 2014 World Cup qualifying stages takes
place in Rio de Janeiro on July 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
