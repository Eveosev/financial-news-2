Telefonica SA (TEF)  may have to pay 240
million euros ($352 million) to  Spain ’s social security system
because the agency says it failed to pay “additional” fees for
integrating workers into the system,  El Mundo  reported, citing a
document from the Labor Ministry.  The fees relate to 75,000 employees that the
telecommunications operator had in 1992 in an organization
called Institucion Telefonica de Prevision, who were integrated
into the social security system, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
