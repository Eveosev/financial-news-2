Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC (ADCB) 
climbed to the highest level in more than two years after a
report the United Arab Emirates’ third-biggest bank may sell its
25 percent stake in Malaysia’s  RHB Capital Bhd. (RHBC)  for twice the
book value.  The shares rallied 2.7 percent to 3.03 dirhams, the
strongest since October 2008, at the 2 p.m. close in  Abu Dhabi .
ADCB has surged 11 percent in the past seven trading days.  The Star reported June 1 that ADCB identified three top
bidders for its RHB Capital stake in a board meeting May 31
after receiving bids from  Japan ’s Sumitomo Mitsui Financial
Group Inc., a Chinese bank and several private equity firms that
include  Carlyle Group . The bidders have offered between 2 and
2.5 times book value for the stake, the Star reported, citing an
unidentified person.  Should the bank successfully sell the stake “at these
prices, it would make around 1.5 billion dirhams ($408 million)
to 2 billion dirhams on the sale,” said Nabil Farhat, a partner
at Abu Dhabi-based Al Fajer Securities. “That would bring 2011
profits back above 3 billion dirhams to pre-crisis levels.”  An ADCB official, who didn’t want to be identified because
of company policy, declined to comment when contacted by
Bloomberg today. ADCB wants to sell its RHB stake and has
appointed  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and Bank of America Corp.’s
Merrill Lynch & Co. to advise on an exit, Chief Executive
Officer Ala’a Eraiqat said in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
