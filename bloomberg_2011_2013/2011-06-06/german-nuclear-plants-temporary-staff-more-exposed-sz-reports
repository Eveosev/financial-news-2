German nuclear plants employ more
than 24,000 temporary workers who are exposed to more radiation
than directly employed staff,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported,
citing a government document.  The plants employ 6,000 people who carry so-called
radiation passes and these are exposed to about 1.7 sievert of
radiation a year in total; external staff with radiation passes
are exposed to a total of 12.8 sievert a year, the newspaper
said, citing government data from 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
