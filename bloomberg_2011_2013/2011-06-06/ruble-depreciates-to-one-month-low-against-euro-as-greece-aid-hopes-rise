The ruble advanced to the strongest
level in four weeks versus the dollar as oil,  Russia ’s chief
export earner, advanced.  The ruble appreciated 0.4 percent to 27.8250 per dollar at
the 5 p.m. close in Moscow, the strongest level since May 11.
The Russian currency declined 0.5 percent to 40.6510 per euro,
leaving it little changed at 33.5967 versus the central bank’s
target dollar-euro basket.  Crude for July delivery gained 49 cents a barrel from the
close of ruble trading on June 3, to $99.20 per barrel by 5 p.m.
in Moscow today. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries will probably maintain current production levels when
it meets June 8, according to 27 out of 30 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
