President  Eric Rosengren  said it’s “too soon” to tell whether
the economy needs more stimulus from the central bank following
a jobs report last week that is a “disappointment.”  “We’re still talking about what the appropriate exit
strategy will be,” the regional bank chief said in an interview
today with CNBC. “As to timing, it depends on how the incoming
data come in.”  U.S. employers in May added just 54,000 payroll jobs, 
the fewest number of workers in eight months, Labor
Department figures showed on June 3. Unemployment unexpectedly
rose to 9.1 percent from 9 percent a month earlier.  “It’s too soon to determine what the next steps for
monetary policy will be,” Rosengren said. He added that the
U.S. should grow about 3 percent in the second half of the year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
