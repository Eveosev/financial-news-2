International Paper Co. (IP)  said it has
made an unsolicited bid to buy  Temple-Inland Inc. (TIN)  for $30.60 a
share in cash.  International Paper said it informed Temple-Inland of the
bid “verbally” on May 17 and had further communication after
that.  The company said Temple-Inland’s board rejected a takeover
proposal on June 4. International Paper said it sent a letter to
Temple-Inland today “expressing its continued interest” in
pursuing a deal. A copy of the letter was included in a
PRNewswire statement.  International Paper said its offer represented a 44 percent
premium for Temple-Inland shareholders.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
