Tokyo Gas Co.,  Japan ’s biggest gas
distributor, plans to buy stakes in natural-gas projects to
ensure supplies, and import between 10 million and 11 million
metric tons of the fuel this year, a company official said.  “We want to be the foundation buyer” from liquefied
natural gas projects, Kunio Nohata, senior general manager of
gas resources, said in an interview after attending the Asia Oil
and Gas Conference in  Kuala Lumpur  today. He didn’t identify the
developments that Tokyo Gas is considering.  Demand for natural gas from factories and businesses in
Japan has fallen between 5 percent and 10 percent after the
March 11 earthquake, he said. The decline was compensated by
increased consumption at  power plants  making up for a loss of
generation from nuclear reactors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
