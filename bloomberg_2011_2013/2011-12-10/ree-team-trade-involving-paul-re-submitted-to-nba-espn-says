The three-team trade that would send
guard  Chris Paul  to the  Los Angeles Lakers  has been re-submitted
to the National Basketball Association office, ESPN reported on
its website.  Commissioner David Stern two days ago rejected a deal
sending Paul, a four-time All-Star who’s scheduled to become a
free agent after this season, to Los Angeles from the league-
owned New Orleans Hornets. The NBA cited unspecific basketball
reasons in denying the deal.  Details of the new proposal weren’t immediately known, but
the changes were made to get Stern’s approval, ESPN said, citing 
people close to the negotiations.  New Orelans would have received forward Lamar Odom from the
Lakers, as well as guards Kevin Martin and Goran Dragic, forward
Luis Scola and a first-round draft pick from Houston in the
original trade, with the Rockets getting  Pau Gasol  from the
Lakers.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
