The  Boston Celtics  signed guards
Marquis Daniels and Keyon Dooling, forward Chris Wilcox and
center Greg Stiemsma on the first day of free agency in the
 National Basketball Association .  Terms of the agreements werenâ€™t disclosed, the team said.  Daniels, 30, who also plays forward, appeared in 49 games

5.6 points and hit 49.5 percent from the floor.  Wilcox, 29, played in 57 games for the Detroit Pistons last

acquired from the  Milwaukee  Bucks in exchange for the draft
rights to Albert Miralles which were obtained Aug. 3, 2005, when
the Celtics traded Antoine Walker to the  Miami Heat  in a five-
team trade. Dooling was in a career-high 80 games last season
with Milwaukee, leading the franchise with assists in 20 games

NBA.com reported, citing a person familiar with the
negotiations. The two-time All-Star is coming off a
rehabilitation stint for a torn ACL.  Earlier yesterday, the Celtics acquired forward Brandon Bass, 26, from the  Orlando Magic  for 25-year-old forward Glen Davis, Yahoo! Sports.com reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
