Allianz SE (ALV)  Chief Economist Michael Heise said the  European Central Bank  shouldn’t massively widen
its bond purchases,  Tagesspiegel  reported, citing an interview.  Heise said the ECB shouldn’t do anything that reduces the
member states’ willingness to reform, the newspaper said.  The decisions made at the summit of European leaders in
Brussels was a step toward “fiscal integration” while avoiding
a “rash pooling of national debt,” Heise said, according to
Tagesspiegel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
