Israelis and Palestinians must show
restraint, the U.K. Foreign Office said, as  Israel  carried out
airstrikes on Gaza and Palestinian groups launched rocket
attacks on Israel.  “We are concerned by the escalation in violence over recent
days, and reports of civilian casualties,” the Foreign Office
said in an e-mailed statement, condemning actions that hurt or
kill civilians and calling on all sides “to show restraint.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
