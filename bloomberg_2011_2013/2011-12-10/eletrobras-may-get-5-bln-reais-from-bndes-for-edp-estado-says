Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA 
will get as much as 5 billion reais ($2.8 billion) in financing
from Brazil’s development bank, known as BNDES, to bid for a
stake in  EDP-Energias de Portugal SA (EDP) ,  O Estado de S. Paulo 
reported, citing a person it didn’t identify.  Eletrobras, as Latin America’s largest publicly traded
utility is known, made a binding offer for the 21.35 percent
stake in EDP that Portugal’s government is selling, the Rio de
Janeiro-based power company said yesterday in a regulatory
filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
