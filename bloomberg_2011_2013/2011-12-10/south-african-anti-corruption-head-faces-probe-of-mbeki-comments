South Africa’s anti-corruption unit
head, Willem Heath, faces an investigation into comments he made
about former President  Thabo Mbeki , less than two weeks after
being appointed to the position.  President  Jacob Zuma  has instructed his office to
investigate the “facts and circumstances surrounding the Heath
interview” published in Johannesburg-based City Press on Dec.
4, Zuma’s office said in an e-mailed statement today. Heath
alleged in the interview that Mbeki had instructed the National
Prosecuting Authority to prosecute Zuma for corruption and rape.  “The presidency and the government in general have nothing
whatsoever to do with the comments made by Mr. Heath,” the
presidency said. “None of the allegations made by Mr. Heath
have been attributed to any duty or function which he exercises
as head of the Special Investigative Unit.”  Heath, who was appointed as head of the unit on Nov. 29,
advised Zuma during his corruption trial. The former judge left
as head of the unit more than a decade ago after Mbeki excluded
him from investigating a multi billion-rand arms purchase.  Zuma, who ousted Mbeki as leader of the ruling  African
National Congress  in 2007, was acquitted on rape charges in
2006. Corruption charges against him were dropped in 2009, weeks
before he became president.  To contact the reporter on this story:
