Bundesbank President and European
Central Bank council member Jens Weidmann said decisions reached
at the European summit in Brussels amount to a “fiscal pact, not
a fiscal union,” Frankfurt Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reported.  Weidmann said sovereign rights over budgets were preserved
and that the European Union won’t have the ability to directly
intervene, according to an e-mailed preview of an interview that
will appear in tomorrow’s edition of the newspaper.  Weidmann said issuing euro bonds wouldn’t solve fundamental
government debt problems, but exacerbate them, the paper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
