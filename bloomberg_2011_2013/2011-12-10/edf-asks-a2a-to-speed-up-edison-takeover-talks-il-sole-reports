Electricite de France SA, the French
company trying to buy Italyâ€™s  Edison SpA (EDN) , asked  A2A SpA (A2A)  and
other Italian shareholders to speed up the conclusion of
takeover talks,  Il Sole 24 Ore  reported.  Since there is still discussion around the amount of debt
each shareholder will take on after the breakup of Edison
assets,  EDF (EDF)  proposed a different division that would burden the
Italians with less debt, Il Sole reported, citing a private
letter from EDF Chief Financial Officer Thomas Piquemal to A2A
general manager Renato Ravanelli. EDF is not however willing to
give Italian shareholders veto power over whether to undertake a
capital increase in the future, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
