U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
members tried to impede Chairman  Gregory Jaczko ’s response to
 Japan ’s reactor crisis in March, according to a report from
Representative  Edward Markey .  Commissioners George Apostolakis, William Magwood IV,
William Ostendorff and Kristine Svinicki “conspired, with each
other and with senior NRC staff, to delay the release of and
alter” an agency task-force study on the crisis, according to
the 22-page report released by Markey’s office yesterday.  The report is based on documents submitted by the
commissioners in response to an October request from Markey of
 Massachusetts , the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources
Committee.  Jaczko, a former congressional science fellow for Markey,
has urged the NRC to move quickly in implementing the task-
force’s recommendations to improve safety at U.S. reactors after
an earthquake and tsunami in March caused radiation leaks and
meltdowns at  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) ’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi
nuclear plant.  Commissioners have endorsed some of the task force’s
findings and differ on how to implement them, agency spokesman
Eliot Brenner said in a phone interview.  Markey’s report found e-mails and other documents with
“high levels of suspicion and hostility directed” at Jaczko.
At other times, e-mails showed Jaczko’s colleagues “assumed ill
intent on the part of the chairman” and tried to “undermine
his efforts or refuse his requests.”  The House Oversight and Government Reform committee has
summoned the commissioners to a Dec. 14 hearing to discuss rifts
in the agency’s leadership.  Jaczko wasn’t open with colleagues about his intent to stop
work on a proposed waste site at  Nevada ’s Yucca Mountain,
according to a June report from the NRC’s inspector general.  Republicans have accused Jaczko of stopping work on the
Yucca project for political reasons, which he has denied.  To contact the reporter on this story:
