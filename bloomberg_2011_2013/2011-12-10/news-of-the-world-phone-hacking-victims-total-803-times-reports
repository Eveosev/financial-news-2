The final number of people whose
phones were hacked by  News Corp. (NWSA) â€™s now-defunct News of the World
tabloid will be about 800,  The Times  reported, citing an
interview with the Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers of
the Metropolitan Police.  Officers have contacted 803 people who are thought to have
been hacked, The Times said, citing Akers. A further 1,200
people who have contacted the inquiry are thought not to have
been victims, the paper said.  The cost of the investigation, known as Operation Weeting,
is expected to be 4 million pounds ($6.3 million) a year,
according to the report. Arrests since the operation began in
January have totaled 18, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
