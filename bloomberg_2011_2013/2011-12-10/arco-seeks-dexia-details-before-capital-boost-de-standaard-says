Dexia SA (DEXB)  shareholder Groep Arco is
seeking further information on the business plan of French unit
Dexia Credit Local SA before it will agree to sign off on a 4.2
billion euro ($5.6 billion) capital increase,  De Standaard 
reported, citing people it didnâ€™t identify.  Dexia said last month that it would bolster the shareholder
equity of its French unit through a conversion of subordinated
debt due to Dexia SA into stock, and allocating proceeds from
the sale of the Belgian bank to the French unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
