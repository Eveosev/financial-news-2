United Nations global warming talks
headed toward a deadlock as China and  India  blocked a European
Union proposal the 27-nation bloc said was essential for it to
extend limits on pollution.  India’s Environment Minister Jayanthi Natarajan said she
objected to efforts by the EU to force developing nations into a
legally-binding treaty limiting fossil fuel emissions by 2020.
Chinese envoy Xie Zhenhua said rich nations are “not acting on
their commitments” to cut  greenhouse gases .  “India will never be intimidated by threats,” Natarajan
said at the talks in Durban, South Africa today. “How do I give
a blank check and give a legally-binding agreement to sign away
the rights of 1.2 billion people?”  The EU said involvement of all nations in curtailing
greenhouse gases is essential for it to extend the emissions
limits in the  Kyoto Protocol  expiring next year. The Kyoto
extension and the EU’s “road map” toward the next climate
treaty are part of a package the UN proposed for envoys from
more than 190 nations to debate in Durban.  EU Climate Commissioner  Connie Hedegaard  called for more
talks between countries with “divergent views” after hearing
India’s objections to the current draft text.  “We heard some interesting proposals from India on
equity,” she said. Hedegaard stressed that the focus should be
on helping “land this Durban package.”  The South African envoy hosting the talks said she’d work
to break the deadlock.  To contact the reporters on this story:
