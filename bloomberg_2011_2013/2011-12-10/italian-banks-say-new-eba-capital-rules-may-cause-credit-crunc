Italy ’s banking association said it
opposes the new  capital requirements  set by the European Banking
Authority because they increase market volatility and may cause
a credit crunch.  “The timing of the move and the consequent
recapitalization transactions are inappropriate” because they
increase market volatility and “could force a reduction in
assets and a consequent squeeze on credit provided to the
economy,” the association, known as ABI, said in an e-mailed
statement late yesterday.  ABI, which groups together Italy’s main banks, said it has
formally requested a review of the requirements and “intends to
verify” their legitimacy “at all levels.”  The EBA said on Dec. 9 that European Union banks must raise
114.7 billion euros ($153 billion) in fresh capital to withstand
writedowns caused by the area’s sovereign-debt crisis. Italian
banks need to raise an additional 15.4 billion euros in capital,
while German banks will need 13.1 billion euros and Spanish
lenders 26.2 billion euros.  The new requirement is 8 billion euros higher than the
capital needs requested by the EBA in October. The EBA said
lenders should look to boost reserves by cutting bonuses,
retaining earnings or issuing shares, not by shrinking credit.
The banks will have until Jan. 20 to submit their plans for
raising cash.  To contact the reporter on this story:
