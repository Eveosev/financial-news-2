Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  is close
to signing a deal to work with  General Motors Co. (GM)  on fuel-cell
technology,  WirtschaftsWoche  reported, citing unidentified
people with knowledge of the agreement.  BMW will get access to GMâ€™s fuel-cell technology and in
return will help cover research and development costs, the
magazine reported on its website. The two carmakers plan to sign
a memorandum of understanding following the car show in  Detroit 
in January, the magazine said.  GM declined to comment to WirtschaftsWoche while BMW
confirmed it is in negotiations with a U.S. carmaker, without
going into details, WiWo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
