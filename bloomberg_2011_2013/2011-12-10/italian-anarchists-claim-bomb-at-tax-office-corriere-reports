Italian anarchists who sent a letter
bomb to Josef Ackerman, chief executive officer of  Deutsche Bank
AG  on Dec. 8, claimed responsibility for a similar device that
wounded an Italian tax-collection official yesterday in  Rome ,  Il
Corriere della Sera  reported.  Investigators found a message from a group calling itself
FAI, an Italian acronym for “Informal Anarchist Federation,”
the same one that claimed responsibility for the Deutsche Bank
bomb, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
