Barcelona rebounded from an early
deficit to beat Real Madrid 3-1 and join its rival at the top of
the standings in Spanish soccer’s Primera Liga.  Karim Benzema scored in the opening minute last night for
Real, which was seeking its 16th straight win overall and 10th
consecutive in the league.  Alexis Sanchez  pulled Barcelona even
in the first half and the defending Spanish and European
champion got goals after the break on Xavi Hernandez’s deflected
shot and  Cesc Fabregas ’s header.  The teams are tied with 37 points with Real having played
one fewer game. Barcelona holds the tiebreaker after the win and
will host the rematch of the game known as “El Clasico” in
April.  Benzema scored after just 23 seconds at the Bernabeu
stadium following a poor clearance from goalkeeper Victor Valdes. Sanchez tied it in the 30th minute when he took a pass
from Lionel Messi and fired a shot past Iker Casillas.  Barcelona used some luck to take the lead eight minutes
into the second half as Xavi’s long shot deflected off defender
Marcelo and past lunging goalkeeper Casillas.  Real’s Cristiano Ronaldo then sent a header wide from six
yards out after being left alone and Fabregas clinched the
victory by heading in Dani Alves’s cross less than a minute
later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
