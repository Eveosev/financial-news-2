European Aeronautic, Defence and
Space Co. ’s board agreed to delay a decision to give details of
changes to its senior management until January, the Financial
Times newspaper said.  EADS may have postponed the move because the French
government hasn’t approved the moves as it’s focused on the
eurozone crisis, the report said, citing two unidentified people
familiar with the plans. EADS had been hoping to detail changes
to management including a new chairman and chief executive
officer by the end of 2011, the report said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
