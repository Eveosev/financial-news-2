Monchengladbach missed a chance to
move into first place in German soccer’s Bundesliga after a 1-0
loss at Augsburg.  Jan-Ingwer Callsen-Bracker scored in the 51st minute to
give Augsburg, which sits 17th in the 18-team league, the home
victory. Monchengladbach remains tied with Dortmund with 30
points, one behind  Bayern Munich  and Schalke.  Werder Bremen moved up to fifth place by beating Wolfsburg
4-1, Hoffenheim beat Nurnberg 2-0 and Cologne defeated Freiburg
4-0. Mainz and Hamburg finished 0-0, as did the game between
Hannover and  Bayer Leverkusen .  Schalke beat Hertha Berlin 2-1 last night to pull even with
Bayern Munich, which visits Stuttgart tomorrow. Dortmund hosts
Kaiserslautern in tomorrow’s other game.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
