Properties in  London  valued at 1
million pounds ($1.6 million) have risen in value by 395 pounds
a day this year, driven by foreign investors from Asia, Europe
and the  Middle East , according to Knight Frank LLP.  While London prices also gained overall, across the U.K. as
a whole they fell by 7.30 pounds a day through the beginning to
December as demand was curbed by a weak economy and lack of
mortgages, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
