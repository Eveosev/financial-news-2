The  New York Knicks  acquired center
Tyson Chandler as part of a three-team trade with the  Dallas 
Mavericks and  Washington Wizards .  The Knicks sent center Ronny Turiaf and a 2013 second-round
draft pick to the Wizards and guard Andy Rautins to Dallas.  “Signing a player of Tyson’s caliber, with championship
experience, to this roster, is an opportunity we could not pass
up,” interim general manager Glen Grunwald said in a statement.  Chandler, 29, averaged 10.1 points and 9.4 rebounds for the
National Basketball Association champion Mavericks last season.  The Knicks also waived guard Chauncey Billups under the
NBA’s new amnesty clause. Billups, 34, averaged 16.8 points and
5.4 assists in 72 games last season with Denver and the Knicks.
He was scheduled to make $14.2 million.  The amnesty clause, included in the league’s new labor
agreement, allows every team one opportunity to waive a player
without the remainder of his contract counting toward the salary
cap or tax threshold.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
