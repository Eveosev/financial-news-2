Bayerische Motoren Werke AG , Audi
AG,  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes and  Porsche AG (PAH3)  will shorten planned
factory closures over Christmas to deal with a backlog of
orders,  Automobilwoche  reported, citing managers at the
carmakers.  Plants are operating at full capacity and some factories
will only close for a week over the holidays, according to the
e-mailed preview of an article that will appear in the
magazine’s Dec. 12 edition.  Meanwhile, volume carmakers like  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ,  Ford Motor
Co. (F)  and  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Opel are mostly planning a two-week
production break, the magazine said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
