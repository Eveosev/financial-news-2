U.K. 10-year gilts completed their
biggest weekly gain in a month as investors sought safer assets
after  Standard & Poor’s  said it may cut the ratings of 15 euro-
area nations due to the region’s debt crisis.  Two-year yields dropped to a record as U.K. reports showed
manufacturing output fell and economic growth slowed, and amid
speculation investors reinvested coupon payments. The pound rose
versus most its major counterparts on concern measures agreed by
European leaders will be sufficient to resolve the debt turmoil.
 Bank of England  policy makers left their asset-purchase target
at 275 billion pounds ($430 billion).  “There’s fairly captive demand for gilts so the default
option is to reinvest the cash back into gilts, that’s partly
what we’ve seen” helping shorter-maturity notes this week, said
 Sam Hill , a fixed-income strategist at  RBC Capital Markets  in
London. “The prospects for more quantitative easing in the U.K.
in 2012 and the slant that the rating agencies have taken is a
factor that’s supporting” longer-dated gilts, he said.  The 10-year yield fell 13 basis points, or 0.13 percentage
point, this week to 2.16 percent at the 5 p.m. close of trading
in London yesterday. The 3.75 percent bond due September 2021
gained 1.19, or 11.90 pounds per 1,000 pound face amount, to
113.89. The yield earlier dropped to a record 2.09 percent.  Two-year yields fell to 0.317 percent on Dec. 8, the lowest
since at least 1992, when Bloomberg began collecting the data.
They rose two basis points to 0.39 percent over the week.  Manufacturing Shrank  Gilts were supported as reports underlined the damage
caused to the U.K. economy by the debt crisis in  Europe .  Manufacturing output shrank 0.7 percent in October, the
 Office for National Statistics  said Dec. 7. The National
Institute of Economic and Social Research said the same day that
economic growth slowed in the three months through November.  “The euro economy is clearly a growing downside risk for
the U.K., and data this week has increased the chance of the
U.K. entering a technical recession,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , an
Edinburgh-based fixed-income strategist at RIA Capital Markets
Ltd. “Further quantitative easing is likely early next year.”  Gilts have returned 21 percent in the 19 months since euro
leaders forged their first plan to contain the debt turmoil.
That outpaced the 9.1 percent gain in German government debt in
the same period, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and
the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  The U.K. is scheduled to sell 3 billion pounds of gilts
maturing in 2022 on Dec. 14, and 4 billion pounds of debt due
2017 the following day. The Debt Management Office said it plans
to hold up to 17 gilt auctions in the first quarter of 2012.  The pound strengthened 0.5 percent in the week to 85.44
pence per euro, and climbed 0.3 percent to $1.5640.  Sterling has appreciated 0.9 percent in the past three
months, outperforming six of the other nine developed-nation
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
