Eckhard Wurzel, chief economist at
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, said
the euro can only be saved if member countries commit to
structural reforms in their administrations and in the labor-and
product markets,  WirtschaftsWoche  reported.  Wurzel wants to move state supervision and regulation of
banks to the European level, and said it will be necessary to
establish “binding rules” for how to deal with private
investors in the event of sovereign debt defaults, according to
the e-mailed preview of a guest column that Wurzel wrote for the
magazine’s Dec. 12 edition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
