Manchester United captain Nemanja
Vidic may be sidelined for up to a year with a knee injury, the
Daily Mail said.  United manager  Alex Ferguson  said yesterday the defender
will miss the rest of the season after rupturing a cruciate
ligament in a Champions League loss at Basel three days ago.  The Mail reported today that Vidic also damaged his medial
and lateral collateral ligaments, which may force him to a
longer spell on the sidelines. He’ll see a specialist in two
days, but is not expected to have surgery fo another two weeks,
the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
