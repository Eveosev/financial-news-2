Italy’s Catholic Church is “open”
to possible revisions of a norm that exempts it from paying real
estate taxes, Corriere della Sera  reported , citing Angelo Bagnasco, the country’s top bishop.  The norm accounts for between 500 million euros ($669
million) and 2.2 billion euros every year in lost revenue for
the state, Corriere reported, citing two different studies. The
law also exempts other religious and non-profit organizations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
