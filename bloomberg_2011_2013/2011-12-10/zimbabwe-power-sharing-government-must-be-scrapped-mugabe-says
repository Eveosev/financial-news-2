Zimbabwean President  Robert Mugabe 
said a power-sharing government between his Zimbabwe African
National Union-Patriotic Front and the Movement for Democratic
Change must be scrapped.  “We’re preparing a grave for this monster, we must now see
its death,” Mugabe said at the closing ceremony of a  party 
congress in the second-city of Bulawayo today. “It must come to
an end and we must dig its grave so we can now prepare for
elections.”  Mugabe, 87, was forced to share power in February 2009
after his party lost parliamentary elections to the  MDC  in 2008.
Mugabe has been calling for fresh elections since 2010. Prime
Minister and MDC leader  Morgan Tsvangirai  has said his party
won’t contest elections until violence against party members end
and restrictions on media lifted.  Under the terms of the power-sharing agreement,  Zimbabwe 
can’t hold elections until a new constitution is approved by
referendum. Finance Minister  Tendai Biti , who is also secretary-
general of the MDC, didn’t allocate money for elections or a
referendum in 2012 when he presented the country’s national
budget on Nov. 24.  “We can’t continue to have this nonsense of calling for
elections soon,” Mugabe said. “They must be next year and I
hope we can put an end to this impasse.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
