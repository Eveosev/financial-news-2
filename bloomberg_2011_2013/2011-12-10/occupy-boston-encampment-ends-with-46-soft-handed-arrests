Police shut Occupy Boston’s
encampment at about 5 a.m. today, arresting 46 protesters after
Mayor Thomas M. Menino ordered their eviction from parkland in
Dewey Square.  Protesters sat in a circle with their arms linked as more
than 100 officers descended on the camp. Some were singing as
they were arrested and carried away by police.  “This morning, we moved slowly and methodically,’’ said
Boston police spokeswoman Elaine Driscoll. “We’ve had excellent
communication with these individuals and we give them credit.’’  Driscoll said 32 men and 14 women were arrested on charges
of trespassing and disorderly conduct. One member of Occupy
Boston’s media team, who broadcast live on the Internet during
the raid, called the arrests “soft-handed’’ and thanked the
police for not using pepper spray or excessive force.  Garbage trucks quickly arrived and workers began clearing
away remnants of the camp.  The raid occurred almost 30 hours after Menino ordered
protesters to leave by midnight Dec. 8.  To contact the reporters on this story:
