Areva SA (CEI)  is likely to report a loss
for 2011 after it next week announces 2 billion euros ($2.7
billion) of provisions,  Le Figaro  reported, without saying where
it got the information.  The French nuclear company will write down the value of
assets including a uranium mine in Namibia, Le Figaro said,
though there shouldnâ€™t be any provisions against the Olkiluoto
reactor project in  Finland .  Areva spokeswoman Patricia Marie declined to comment today
when contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
