Repsol YPF SA (REP)  and Alliance Oil Co.,
a Stockholm-listed producer and refiner that operates in Russia,
will create a unit to search for oil in the country,  El
Economista  reported, citing unidentified people with knowledge
of the matter.  Repsol will invest 200 million euros ($267.4 million) in
the unit and spend another 200 million euros buying shares in
the joint venture and Alliance Oil will contribute 400 million
euros worth of  oil wells  that are already under exploration as
well as new wells, the newspaper said.  Alliance Oil will own 51 percent of the unit, which will be
created by the year end, and Repsol will own 49 percent, the
newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
