Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez ’s
approval rating rose a half-percentage point to 71.5 percent in
November from the previous month, Ultimas Noticias reported,
citing a poll by Instituto Venezolano de Analisis de Data, or
IVAD.  If the election, scheduled for Oct. 7 of next year, were
to take place today, Chavez would defeat Henrique Capriles Radonski, the current favorite to win an opposition primary, by
55.5 percent to 31.8 percent, the Caracas-based daily said,
citing the poll.  The Caracas-based polling firm’s survey of 1,200 people,
taken between Nov. 21 and Nov. 28, had a margin of error of
about 2.4 percentage points, Ultimas Noticias reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
