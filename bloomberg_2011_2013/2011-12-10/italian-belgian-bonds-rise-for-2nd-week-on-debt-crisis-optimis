Italian  government bonds  rose for a
second week, leading advances among the euro area’s higher-
yielding government securities, as  Europe ’s leaders boosted
their rescue fund in a bid to stem the region’s crisis.  German  two-year note yields  touched a record low on Dec. 8
as the ECB lowered its benchmark rate by a quarter point to 1
percent and extended the range and maturity of loans it offers
to banks. Belgian and  Portuguese 10-year bonds  rallied. The EU’s
leaders said they would channel 200 billion euros ($267 billion)
into the  International Monetary Fund  and tighten anti-deficit
rules.  “We have had a marked improvement in sentiment in the past
two weeks,” said  Michael Leister , a fixed income strategist at
WestLB AG in London. “The market is hopeful that the
politicians are coming up with a solution which supports Italian
bonds. We are cautious because after previous summits we have
seen relief and a risk-rally, but the mood has subsequently
worsened.”  Italy’s  10-year government bond yields  fell 33 basis points
over the week to 6.35 percent as of 4:35 p.m. yesterday in
 London , extending last week’s 58 basis point decline. Two-year
 Italian yields  dropped 58 basis points to 5.99 percent, after
declining 1.10 percentage points the previous week.  Belgian  10-year bond yields  fell 11 basis points to 4.54
percent and similar-maturity Portuguese rates fell 98 basis
points to 12.99 percent.  ECB Cash  ECB President  Mario Draghi  offered banks unlimited cash for
three years on Dec. 8, while damping speculation that the ECB
will buy more government bonds to stem the debt crisis. Spanish
 10-year government bonds  fell for the eighth time in nine weeks,
with yields rising six basis points to 5.74 percent. Italian 10-
year bonds pared their weekly advance after Draghi’s comments
about bond buying.  German two-year note yields were little changed over the
week at 0.32 percent, after falling to a record 0.265 percent on
Dec. 8.  Italian  government bonds  may decline next week as the
nation sells up to 7 billion euros of one-year bills on Dec. 12
and auctions five-year notes on Dec. 14.  Spain  plans to sell
securities maturing in 2016, 2020 and 2021 on Dec. 15, and 12-
and 18-month bills on Dec. 13.  “We have Spain and Italian supply coming up next week so
that will be carefully watched and the bonds will react
depending on how well they go,” Leister said.  Italian government bonds have handed investors a loss of
7.6 percent this year through Dec. 8, according to indexes
compiled by the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies and Bloomberg. German bunds have returned 8.2 percent,
 France ’s debt has earned 2.6 percent and Spain’s has gained 1.6
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
