German Economy Minister and Free
Democrat leader Philipp Roesler said a plan to include  Europe ’s
permanent rescue fund within his party’s constitution has
failed, Bild am Sonntag reported, citing an interview.  Frank Schaeffler , an FDP lawmaker on the parliament finance
committee, hasn’t been able to include the European Stability
Mechanism because it received 16,000 votes, short of the 21,500
votes from party members needed by Dec. 13, Roesler said,
according to the newspaper.  FDP is the junior party in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s
coalition government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
