Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) , the
BlackBerry smartphone maker, said it will “work through” any
concerns the Indonesian government has with the Canadian company
to avert any threats of service interruption in the country.  “I’m quite confident we’ll work through this without any
significant negative impacts,”  David Paterson , Research in
Motion’s vice president of government relations, said today in a
telephone interview.  Media reports this week said that  Indonesia ’s government is
threatening to cut BlackBerry data services if it doesn’t comply
with commitments made in January. Research In Motion sent a
letter Sept. 23 to the Indonesian government saying it had
“fully addressed” the issues raised by the government, which
included adding content filters and speeding up its regional
network, Paterson said.  “As recently as last week, they’ve acknowledged that we
have done the things that we said we would do,” Paterson said.
“So these are new quotes that are coming through the media,
they have not been raised with us directly.”  The Waterloo, Ontario-based company said in a separate e-
mailed statement that it hasn’t been advised of any new specific
requirements beyond the initial requests by the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
