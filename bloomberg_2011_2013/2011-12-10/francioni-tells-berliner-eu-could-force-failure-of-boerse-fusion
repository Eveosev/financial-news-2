Reto Francioni, the chief executive
officer of Deutsche Boerse AG, said his company’s merger plans
with NYSE Euronext could be made unworkable by too-strict
European Union competition conditions, the  Berliner Zeitung  and
 Frankfurter Rundschau  reported, citing an interview.  If the condition for allowing the fusion was the sale of
either Eurex or Liffe, “a significant part of the advantage”
would be lost, Francioni was quoted by the newspapers as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
