UCLA hired former National Football
League coach Jim L. Mora as its football coach, the school said
on its website.  Mora went 31-33 in four seasons as coach of the  Atlanta
Falcons  and Seattle Seahawks between 2004 and 2009. The son of
former NFL coach Jim E. Mora, he spent the past two seasons as a
television analyst with the NFL network.  Mora replaces Rick Neuheisel, who was fired last month
after a 50-0 loss to rival  Southern California  in the regular
season finale. Nehueisel went 21-29 in his four seasons with the
Bruins.  UCLA said Mora will be introduced at a press conference
next week.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
