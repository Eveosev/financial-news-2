The delivery of 22 oil-drilling rigs
to  Petroleo Brasileiro SA  may be delayed by Estaleiro Atlantico
Sul, the Brazilian shipyard,  O Estado de S. Paulo  reported,
citing a government report.  The first rig, originally delivered in May 2010, has been
under repair for 19 months and is expected to be shipped to
Petrobras this month, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper said. That
delay may affect the construction of the other rigs ordered,
Estado said, citing the report.  Petrobras will receive the second rig by July or August of
next year, about four months later than initially expected, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
