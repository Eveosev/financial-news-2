 A weaker Mexican peso may translate
into inflationary pressures and the potential impact of a
considerable depreciation is “unknown,” said Bank of  Mexico 
Deputy Governor Manuel Sanchez.  Sanchez added that the pass-through from exchange rate
movements to consumer prices has fallen in recent years. His
comments were published on the central bank’s  website  today.  While international financial turbulence has negatively
impacted the Mexican peso-denominated bond market the effects on
the national currency have been greater, Sanchez said.  “The relatively minor impact of the financial instability
on Mexico’s yield curve seems to reflect the high proportion of
long-term bonds within foreign holdings of peso-denominated
 government securities ,” Sanchez said.  International investors held 40.5 percent of the fixed-rate
peso bonds known as Mbonos on Nov. 30 compared with 29.7 percent
a year earlier, according to the most recent data available from
the central bank.  The peso gained 1 percent today to 13.5744 per  U.S. dollar 
for an advance of 0.5 percent this week. The increase pared its
decline in 2011 to 9.1 percent, the worst performance among
Latin America’s six-most traded currencies.  The central bank official spoke today at the U.S.- Mexico
Chamber of Commerce in  Los Angeles , according to a transcript
published on the bank’s website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
