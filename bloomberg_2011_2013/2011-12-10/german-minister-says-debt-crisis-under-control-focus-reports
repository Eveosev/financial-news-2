German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said the euro-zone debt crisis is “under control”
following reforms agreed in Brussels,  Focus  magazine reported.  Schaeuble writes in Focus that the euro is “stable” and
that the real problem is the high debt of individual states and
their lack of competitiveness, the magazine said in an e-mailed
