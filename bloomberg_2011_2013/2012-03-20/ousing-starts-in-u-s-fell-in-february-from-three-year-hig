Housing starts in the U.S. hovered
in February near a three-year high and building permits rose,
adding to signs that the industry at the heart of the last
financial crisis is stabilizing.  Builders  broke ground  on 698,000 homes at an annual rate,
in line with the median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News and down 1.1 percent from a January pace that was
stronger than previously reported, Commerce Department figures
showed today in  Washington .  Building permits , a proxy for future
construction, climbed to the highest level since October 2008.  Gains in homebuilding are benefitting construction-material
suppliers like  Owens Corning Inc. (OC)  as the industry heals
following the worst slump on record. The jump in applications is
a reflection of growing confidence that indicates housing will
no longer hold back the economic expansion.  “The housing market continues to recover at a very gradual
rate,” said  Sal Guatieri , a senior economist at BMO Capital
Markets in Toronto, who forecast a 697,000 pace for housing
starts. “The increase in permits likely flags further strength
in the months ahead.”  Stocks fell as commodities slumped on concern about an
economic slowdown in  China . The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
dropped 0.3 percent to 1,405.52 at the close in  New York .  The  median estimate  in a Bloomberg survey of 80 economists
called for a rise to 700,000. Estimates ranged from 650,000 to
775,000. The prior month was revised up to 706,000, the highest
since October 2008, from a 699,000 pace.  More Permits  Permits (NHSPATOT)  increased to a 717,000 annual pace, the most since
October 2008, today’s report showed. They were projected to rise
to a 686,000 annual rate, from 682,000 the prior month,
according to the survey median.  The pace of homebuilding last month was led by a jump in
multifamily construction that indicates demand for rental
housing is increasing.  Work on  multifamily homes , including townhouses and
apartment buildings, last month advanced 21 percent to an annual
rate of 241,000. Construction of single-family houses fell 9.9
percent, the biggest drop in a year, to a 457,000 rate.  Both categories saw permits increase last month, indicating
the drop in single-family activity will be short-lived.  Combined sales of new and existing homes climbed in January
to the highest level in more than a year. They probably kept
improving last month.  Home Sales  Demand for previously owned houses advanced in February to
the highest level since May 2010, according to the median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg before a report
tomorrow from the National Association of Realtors. Two days
later, figures from the Commerce Department will show purchases
of new homes increased to the highest level since December 2010,
according to the Bloomberg survey.  Building materials-makers like Owens Corning are among
companies benefiting as housing stabilizes.  “We have the wind at our back as the economy recovers and
housing improves,” Sheree Bargabos, president of roofing and
asphalt at the Toledo, Ohio-based company, said on a March 9
conference call. “Growth is anticipated as the housing market
recovers, driven by home affordability, improving home values
and home remodeling activity.”  Paul Hylbert, chairman of Kodiak Building Partners in
Denver,  Colorado , a building materials supplier, said “business
is definitely picking up. We are on the road to recovery.”
Nonetheless, “we will see some fits and starts,” he said in an
interview last month. Sales were up 44 percent in December from
a year earlier and 60 percent in January, Hylbert said.  Annual Data  The February homebuilding data compare with 608,800 housing
starts last year, up from 586,900 in 2010 and reflecting gains
in multifamily construction. The 554,000 housing units begun in
2009 were the fewest since record-keeping began in 1959. During
the past decade’s housing boom, starts reached a peak of 2.07
million in 2005.  Two of four regions showed a decrease in February starts,
led by a 12 percent drop in the Northeast. In the West,
construction fell 5.9 percent. Homebuilding climbed 3 percent in
the Midwest and 1.5 percent in the South.  Optimism among homebuilders has been improving in recent
months. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo
 index  of builder confidence held in March at the highest level
since June 2007 as sales expectations climbed for a sixth month,
figures showed yesterday.  Mortgage Rates  The average  30-year fixed-rate  mortgage reached an all-time
low of 3.87 percent in February, according to data from  Freddie
Mac .  A measure of housing  affordability  a month earlier climbed
to a record 206.1, according to the National Association of
Realtors. A value of 100 means a family earning the national
median income can afford a median-priced property at current
 mortgage rates .  Federal Reserve policy makers last week said they will
continue to swap $400 billion in short-term securities with
long-term debt to lengthen the average maturity of the central
bank’s holdings, a move dubbed Operation Twist and aimed at
bringing down borrowing costs like mortgage rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
