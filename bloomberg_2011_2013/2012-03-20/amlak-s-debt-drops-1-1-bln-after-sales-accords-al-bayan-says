Amlak Finance PJSC (AMLAK) ’s debt was
reduced by 4 billion dirhams ($1.1 billion) after the lender
sold land and reached agreements with some creditors,  Al Bayan 
reported, citing Sultan Bin Saeed al-Mansouri, the  United Arab
Emirates ’ economy minister.  It will be some time before the company’s shares resume
trading as a government committee tries to stabilize the
mortgage provider, the newspaper cited al-Mansouri as saying.
The government would rather help the company to reorganize its
debt than declare it bankrupt, he said.  Amlak Finance’s total liabilities reached 11 billion
dirhams at the end of September. Its shares haven’t traded since
November 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
