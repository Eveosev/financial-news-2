U.S. stocks posted the best returns
when 10-year Treasury yields rose to close to 4 percent,
according to a study by Standard & Poor’s that tracked market
performance since 1953.  The  S&P 500 Index (SPX) , the benchmark measure of U.S. equities,
advanced 1.7 percent a month on average during periods when 10-
year yields climbed to a range of 3 percent to 4 percent,
according to data compiled by New York-based S&P. That’s the
best performance among six categories of rising yields studied
by the firm. Stocks began to fall when yields exceeded 6
percent, the study found.  While rising yields tend to boost borrowing costs for
companies and act as “a depressant in intrinsic value
calculations,” they can also suggest a strengthening economy
and prompt investors to switch to equities, according to  Sam Stovall , S&P’s chief equity strategist.  “The ‘sweet spot’ for equity prices appears to be a rising
rate environment between 3 percent and 4 percent, as a growing
economy reduces unemployment while increasing corporate
earnings, yet does not trigger growth-slowing efforts by the
central bank,” Stovall wrote in a report yesterday.  Stocks rallied last week while 10-year yields had the
biggest weekly increase in eight months as the  Federal Reserve 
raised its assessment of the economy. The  S&P 500  yesterday
climbed 0.4 percent to 1,409.75, the highest level since May
2008. The 10-year yield rose eight basis points to 2.38 percent,
the highest level since October, according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader prices.  The S&P 500’s monthly gain averaged 1.2 percent when 10-
year yields climbed to no higher than 3 percent, according to
Stovall’s study. The return was 1.3 percent when yields rose to
between 4 percent and 5 percent, the data show. The S&P 500 fell
0.03 percent a month when yields jumped to 6 percent to 7
percent. The loss widened to 0.5 percent when yields surpassed 7
percent, the study shows.  “Rising rates don’t necessarily sound the death knell of
equity price advances,” Stovall wrote. “On the contrary, they
could instead offer a catalyst to equity prices, as new cash
from fleeing bond investors seeks a new home. The key seems to
be where  interest rates  are relative to the ‘line in the sand’
at 6 percent.”  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  has kept the central bank’s
benchmark interest rate near zero since December 2008 and
expanded the Fed’s balance sheet with two rounds of asset
purchases totaling $2.3 trillion. S&P forecast the yield on 10-
year notes to average no more than 3 percent through 2013 on
expectations that economic growth will remain slow.  The  U.S. economy  will expand 2.2 percent this year,
according to the median forecast of 72 economists in a Bloomberg
survey. While that’s up from 1.7 percent in 2011, it’s less than
the 3.7 percent  average  from 1983 to 2000.  “Should they be proven to have underestimated the speed
with which interest rates climb in the coming year, history
would say, but not guarantee, that rising rates might actually
speed the price advance of equities, not slow them,” Stovall
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
