Slovak Premier-elect  Robert Fico 
selected Peter Kazimir, a lawmaker from his Smer party, to be
finance minister in a new Cabinet after winning March 10
elections.  The nomination was confirmed to Bloomberg by Smer spokesman
Erik Tomas by phone today from Bratislava, Slovakia. Fico has
said he’ll ask President Ivan Gasparovic to appoint Cabinet
members before the new parliament’s first session on April 4.  Kazimir, 43, was a deputy of Finance Minister Jan Pociatek
during Fico’s previous rule from 2006 to 2010. he helped oversee
Slovakia’s entry into the euro region in 2009 as well as
participation in the creation of the area’s bailout mechanisms.  Smer will form the government alone after it won 83 of the
chamber’s 150 seats on pledges to cut the  budget deficit  by
taxing the rich. Fico has pledged to bring the country in line
with European Union efforts to fight the sovereign-debt crisis
after toppling a government that held up the approval of the
bloc’s enhanced rescue mechanism.  To contact the reporter on this story:
