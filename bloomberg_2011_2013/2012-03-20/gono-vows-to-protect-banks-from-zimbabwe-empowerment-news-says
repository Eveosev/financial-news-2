Zimbabwe central bank Governor
Gideon Gono vowed to protect banks from empowerment laws that
could destabilize the industry,  Daily News  said, citing Gono.  The law, which requires foreign and white-owned businesses
to sell or cede 51 percent of their shares to black Zimbabweans,
may lead to unintended consequences for banks, the Harare-based
Daily News cited Gono as saying. Black Zimbabweans without
enough capital should consider licensing unsecured lenders
rather than targeting established banks, the newspaper cited
Gono as saying.  The matter is not in Gono’s domain, Daily News cited
Indigenization Minister Saviour Kasukuwere as saying.  Barclays Bank Plc (BARC) ,  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  and South
Africa’s  Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED)  have units in Zimbabwe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
