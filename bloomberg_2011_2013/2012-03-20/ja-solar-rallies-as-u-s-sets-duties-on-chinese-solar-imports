JA Solar Holdings Co. (JASO) , the world’s
largest solar-cell maker, rose the most in a month as lower-
than-expected preliminary U.S. duties on solar-energy equipment
imports from  China  offset the company’s fourth-quarter loss.  JA Solar’s American depositary receipts rose the most in a
month, gaining 4.4 percent to $1.90 in  New York .  President Barack Obama’s administration imposed preliminary
duties of as much as 4.73 percent on solar-energy equipment
imported from China. Aaron Chew, an analyst at Maxim Group LLC,
said some had expected a tariff of as much as 10 percent.  Shanghai, China-based JA Solar reported a  net loss  per
diluted share of 39 cents, compared with a loss of 36 cents in
the third quarter and profit of 62 cents in the same period a
year ago, the company said in a statement today. JA Solar also
reported a $48.2 million impairment charge related to a
manufacturing facility. Gross margin was 0.5 percent, the
company said, compared with 19 percent a year earlier.  “Gross margins came in significantly below expectations on
higher costs,” said  Gordon Johnson , an analyst at Axion Capital
Management in New York. “They also had to write down the value
of their wafer-making equipment, in effect saying that equipment
is effectively inefficient.”  Johnson has a sell rating on JA Solar’s shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
