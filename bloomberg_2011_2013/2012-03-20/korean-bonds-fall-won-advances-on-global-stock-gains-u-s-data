South Korea ’s government bonds
reversed losses and the won weakened as local stocks retreated.  The  Kospi (KOSPI)  Index of shares declined after closing at 2,047
yesterday, the highest since Aug. 3. Bonds dropped earlier as
upbeat U.S. data prompted investors to favor riskier assets.
Confidence among U.S. homebuilders held at the highest level
since June 2007 in March, figures showed yesterday.  “The Kospi failing to extend gains today has triggered
demand for bonds, especially as some investors saw the recent
drop in bond prices as a buying opportunity,” said Huh Kwan, a
fixed-income trader at Korea Investment & Securities Co. in
Seoul. “Bond futures expire today, and it seems players are
buying the securities as they roll over.”  The yield on the 3.25 percent notes due December 2014 fell
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.59 percent as
of 3:25 p.m. in  Seoul , Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. It
touched 3.64 percent earlier, the highest level for a benchmark
three-year security since August. Three-year debt futures
climbed 0.06 percent to 103.63. The one-year interest-rate swap
declined three basis points to 3.54 percent.  The won weakened 0.2 percent to 1,124.90 per dollar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, fell 60 basis points to 7.98 percent.  “The won is moving within a range as it has become
difficult to predict a direction for the currency, and not many
investors are betting on one position,” said Kim Seong Soo, a
Seoul-based currency trader at Kyongnam Bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
