Enel SpA (ENEL) , Italy’s largest utility,
plans to invest about 750 million euros ($990 million) in
 Romania ’s power distribution network in the next five years.  The Rome-based company, which operates Romania’s grid
through a series of distribution and supply companies, will use
the investment to improve the Balkan country’s network and
install smart meters to improve efficiency from 2012 to2016, a
company spokesman said in an e-mailed message.  Enel is investing in developing markets like Romania,
Russia and Latin America to offset weaker performance in mature
economies such as Italy and Spain. The company also plans to
have 500 megawatts of wind power installations in Romania by
2016 through its renewable energy unit  Enel Green Power SpA. (EGPW)   The completion of the Mochovce nuclear power plant in
 Slovakia , delayed by stress tests following last year’s nuclear
accident in Fukushima, Japan, will not translate into additional
costs, Enel said.  The first of the two 440-megawatt reactors will start
commercial operations at the end of 2013 and the second one will
follow 8 months later, according to the company, which controls
66 percent of utility Slovenske Elektrarne AS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
