Royal Bank of Canada , the country’s
largest bank, agreed to buy private banking assets in  Latin
America , the Caribbean and Africa of Royal Bank of Scotland’s
Coutts unit.  The price wasn’t disclosed, Toronto-based Royal Bank said
today in a statement. The business has client assets of more
than $2 billion.  Royal Bank has said it wants to expand its wealth-
management business globally. The unit accounted for 12 percent
of the lender’s  profit  in 2011.  “This business represents an excellent opportunity to
increase our market share with high net worth and ultra high net
worth clients in key high growth markets,” RBC Wealth
Management Group head George Lewis said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
