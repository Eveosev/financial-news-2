OAO Lukoil (LKOH) , Russia’s biggest non-
state oil producer, will sign an agreement with  Samsung Group 
this week on the development of the West Qurna-2 oil field in
 Iraq , according to the Iraqi Oil Ministry.  South Korea’s Samsung will install “a crude-gathering
facility and a central processing plant for West Qurna-2,” the
ministry said in an e-mailed statement. The deal will be signed
March 22, it said, without elaborating further.  Lukoil expects to complete the purchase of  Statoil ASA (STL) ’s
stake in West Qurna-2 in May, Chief Executive Officer  Vagit Alekperov  said March 14. Lukoil may invite new partners to join
the project, he said.  Moscow-based Lukoil and Norway’s state-controlled Statoil
won the rights to develop the second phase of the field in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
