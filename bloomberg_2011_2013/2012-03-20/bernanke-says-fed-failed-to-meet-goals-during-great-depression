Federal Reserve  Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the U.S. central bank failed during the Great
Depression to keep prices stable and to fulfill its role as
lender of last resort.  “The Federal Reserve failed in both parts of its
mission,” Bernanke said today in the first of four lectures on
the history of the Fed that he plans to deliver at George
Washington University, according to slides of his presentation.  “It did not use monetary policy to prevent deflation and
the collapse in output and employment,” Bernanke said in slides
focused on historical topics and not current monetary policy or
the economic outlook.  The Fed also “did not adequately perform its function as
lender of last resort, allowing many  bank failures  and a
resulting contraction in credit,” he said. “We will want to
keep these lessons in mind as we consider the Fed’s response to
the crisis of 2008-2009.”  Bernanke, a former economics professor at  Princeton
University , returns to the classroom twice this week and next to
explain the central bank’s actions during the financial crisis
and the longest recession since the Great Depression. His
lecture today is titled “Origins and Missions of the Federal
Reserve.”  The chairman plans to speak on March 22 about the central
bank after World War II, and on March 27 and March 29 about the
Fed’s response to the financial crisis and the ensuing
recession.  The lecture series will be streamed live on the  Fed’s
website  and on ustream.tv. Afterwards, the Fed will post the
lectures on its YouTube page.  To contact the reporter on this story:
