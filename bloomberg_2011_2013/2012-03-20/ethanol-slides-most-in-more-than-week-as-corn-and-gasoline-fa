Ethanol declined the most in more
than a week in  Chicago  as corn and gasoline fell.  Futures dropped as corn, the primary ingredient in the
biofuel in the U.S., faltered on speculation that rain in the
Midwest will improve soil moisture before planting starts next
month. Gasoline slipped on concern that demand in  China  will
wane because of increased prices for the motor fuel.  “Corn had an interesting sell-off; some of it is
weather,” said  Ian Jackson , a trader at SCB & Associates in
Chicago. “Ethanol sold off with corn and the energies were
down, sort of a broad-based sell-off.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery fell 3.6 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $2.30 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
biggest decline since March 7. Prices have risen 4.4 percent
this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf decreased
1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.30 a gallon and on the West Coast
the biofuel slipped 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.395, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago dropped 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.29
a gallon and in  New York  the additive lost 0.5 cent to $2.355.  Corn for May delivery sank 16 cents, or 2.4 percent, to
$6.475 a bushel in Chicago. One such unit makes at least 2.75
gallons of the renewable fuel.  Gasoline for April delivery fell 0.47 cent to $3.3631 a
gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The contract
includes reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with
ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
