The  Texas Rangers  re-signed pitcher
 Derek Holland  to a five-year contract after the 25-year-old
left-hander went 16-5 for the American League champions last
season.  Holland’s contract replaces the one-year deal he agreed on
at the start of spring training and runs through the 2016
season. It includes club options for 2017 and 2018, the Rangers
said in a news release without disclosing financial terms.  ESPN
said  the deal is worth $28.5 million, with options for $11
million in 2017 and $11.5 million in 2018.  Holland led the Rangers in wins last season, when he had a
3.95 earned run average in 32 regular-season starts. He won 12
of his final 13 decisions, including the playoffs, while posting
a 2.89 ERA.  Over three Major League Baseball seasons with the Rangers,
who have lost in the  World Series  the past two years, Holland
has a 27-22 record with a 4.73 ERA. He’s 3-0 with a 3.82 ERA in
12 postseason appearances, including four starts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
