The  Federal Reserve  paid $75.4
billion to the  U.S. Treasury  as an expanded bond portfolio
generated $83.6 billion in interest income from its open-market
operations last year.  The Fed’s total assets stood at $2.92 trillion at the end
of 2011, up from $2.43 trillion at the end of the previous year
and about $894 billion in 2007, according to financial
statements released by the central bank today.  The central bank’s balance sheet expanded as it purchased
$2.3 billion of securities in a bid to bring down long-term
borrowing costs and spur the economy after cutting short-term
rates almost to zero in December 2008. Remittances to the
Treasury generated by income from securities holdings are likely
to decline as the economy revives.  “Certainly, the numbers are going to go down,” said
 Stephen Stanley , chief economist at Pierpont Securities LLC in
Stamford,  Connecticut . “From a fiscal standpoint, I think it is
OK because if  interest rates  are going up, that means the
economy is improving and  tax revenue  is going up.”  Treasury 10-year notes fell for a 10th consecutive trading
day, the longest stretch of declines since at least 1985, as
investors bet a strengthening economy will diminish the refuge
appeal of U.S. government securities.  Yields on 10-year notes rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 2.38 percent at 2:02 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. They fell to 2.33
percent earlier after climbing to levels that lured investors.  Monetary Policy  While the Fed returns interest income to the Treasury after
covering its own expenses, sales and purchases of assets by the
Fed are intended to steer  monetary policy , not generate profits.
Remittances in 2011 were up from $74.7 billion in 2010.  The Fed said its reserve banks had net income of $77.4
billion last year. The Fed doesn’t require an appropriation from
Congress to fund its operations because of the self-funding that
results from the interest income.  The Fed said its holdings of  Treasury securities  rose $683
billion last year. Holdings of debt issued by government-
sponsored enterprises fell $45 billion, while holdings of agency
and GSE mortgage-backed securities declined by $156 billion. The
balances held under central bank liquidity swap arrangements
increased by $99.7 billion.  Federal Reserve Bank assets related to credit and liquidity
programs decreased by $95.8 billion. The closing of the American
International Group Inc. recapitalization plan in January 2011
resulted in asset reductions of $47 billion, the Fed said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
