MF Global Inc. was the third most
actively traded bankruptcy case in February, after  Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  and its former brokerage,  Lehman Brothers
Inc ., according to a report.  Investors traded almost $11 million of the defunct MF
Global commodity brokerage as they bet on the value of its
claims, SecondMarket Holdings Inc. said in a report released
today. The trustee liquidating the brokerage said this month he
would return another $685 million to commodity customers, giving
some of them 80 percent of their assets -- previously frozen
when the firm failed --- including earlier distributions of $3.9
billion.  According to court filings this month, Fulcrum Credit
Partners LLC bought more than $130 million of claims on the MF
Global brokerage. The largest claims were bought from ITB
Premium Funds.  The Lehman parent’s debt accounted for 91 percent of the
value of all trading in claims on bankrupt companies in
February, totaling $3.2 billion, the report said. The total was
swollen by a large transfer that wound up with Elliott
Associates LP. Trades in the Lehman brokerage totaled $37.8
million.  All amounts refer to the face value of the claims, not the
trading prices, which reflect payment prospects and aren’t
disclosed.  Once the world’s fourth-biggest investment bank,  New York- 
based Lehman filed the biggest U.S. bankruptcy in history in
2008 listing debt of $613 billion. MF Global Holdings Ltd., the
brokerage’s parent company, filed the eighth-largest U.S.
bankruptcy on Oct. 31 with debt of almost $40 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
