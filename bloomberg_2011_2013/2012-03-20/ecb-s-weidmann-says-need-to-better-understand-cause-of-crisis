European Central Bank council
member Jens Weidmann said policy makers still need to gain a
“deeper understanding” of what caused the financial crisis.  One “important channel of contagion has been the heavy
concentration of sovereign debt at the respective national
banks,” Weidmann, who heads  Germany ’s Bundesbank, said at a
conference in  Frankfurt  today. “When risk perceptions started
to change, banks holding large amounts of distressed sovereign
debt became a severe burden on financial stability. We need to
know more about how to best address this sovereign bank nexus.”  Weidmann said while global research efforts have been
“remarkable,” a “deeper understanding is still required of
those trends in financial markets that led to financial
instability -- and monetary policy measures that sometimes took
central banks to the limits of their mandate.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
