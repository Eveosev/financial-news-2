Lafarge SA (LG) , the world’s biggest
cement maker, has extended a 1.2 billion-euro ($1.6 billion)
credit facility, according to a statement from the company.  The  credit line , originally due to mature in July 2013,
will now run to July 2015 after a deal supported by 24 lenders,
the Paris-based  company  said.  The facility doesn’t include any default clauses linked to
financial covenants, credit ratings or material adverse change,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
