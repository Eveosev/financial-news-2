CEZ AS (CEZ) , the biggest power utility
in the  Czech Republic , snapped two days of gains as commodities
tumbled worldwide amid signs the Chinese economy is slowing.  The stock slid 0.3 percent to 808 koruna, after rising 1.3
percent in the previous two sessions. Electricity for next-year
delivery in  Germany , where CEZ exports some of its output, slid
0.9 percent to 52.25 euros per megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
