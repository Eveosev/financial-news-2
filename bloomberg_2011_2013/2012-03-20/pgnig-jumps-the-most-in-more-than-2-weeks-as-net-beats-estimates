Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i
Gazownictwo SA , Poland’s biggest natural-gas distributor, gained
the most in more than two weeks after earnings exceeded
analysts’ estimates.  The stock rose as much as 2.5 percent, the most since March
2, and traded 0.8 percent higher at 3.97 zloty as of 9:49 a.m.
in Warsaw.  Fourth-quarter net income fell to 302 million zloty ($97
million) from 1.12 billion zloty a year earlier, the company
said today. That beat the mean estimate of nine analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg, which called for a loss of 180.7 million
zloty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
