The dollar may rally versus the
Swiss franc as stronger economic growth in the U.S. increases
interest rates, according to Royal Bank of Scotland Plc.  Investors should buy the franc and target appreciation to
99.50 centimes, Robert Sinche, global head of foreign exchange
strategy at RBS Securities Inc. in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , wrote
to clients today. The wager should be exited if the  currency
pair  closes below the 200-day moving average for two consecutive
days. The 200-day moving average is currently 88.24 centimes per
dollar.  “This is a good entry level for this trade as better data
translates in to a stronger dollar via interest rate
expectations,” Sinche said in an interview. An internal model
shows fair value for the pair to be more than 94, he said.  Stronger-than-forecast employment and manufacturing data
have led the dollar to rally against its major counterparts in
March. The overnight index swap market is indicating an
interest-rate increase from the  Federal Reserve  in the fourth
quarter of 2013, compared with a July 2014 forecast in February.  The  yield premium  investors get from purchasing 10-year
Treasuries versus similar-maturity Swiss debt rose to 142 basis
points, or 1.42 percentage points, from 127 basis points at the
beginning of the month.  RBS forecast the dollar trade at 95 centimes by midyear
before weakening to 90 centimes by December. The franc weakened
0.1 percent to 91.17 yesterday in  New York  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
