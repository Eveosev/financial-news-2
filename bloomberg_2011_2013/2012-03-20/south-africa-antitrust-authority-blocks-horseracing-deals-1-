South Africa’s  Competition
Commission  recommended that a series of transactions involving
 Phumelela Gaming & Leisure Ltd. (PHM)  be blocked because it will limit
competition in the horseracing and betting industry.  As part of the transaction, Kenilworth Racing (Pty) Ltd.
plans to buy the Western Cape business of closely-held  Gold
Circle (Pty) Ltd. , the Pretoria-based commission said. The
Thoroughbred Horseracing Trust, the largest shareholder in
Phumelela, will then acquire Kenilworth, a company specifically
created for the transaction, the commission said. Phumelela will
then manage Kenilworth and Gold Circle, it said.  “The proposed transactions will significantly lessen
competition in the horseracing administration, horseracing
television rights as well as the betting markets,” the
commission said in an e-mailed statement today. “This will
allow Phumelela to further entrench its already strong position
such that it can exert market power in these markets.”  Phumelela and Gold Circle are the only operators with
licenses for betting and gambling activities in each province,
the commission said. Gold Circle holds the license in the
Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal and Phumelela the remaining
provinces. After the transaction, Phumelela will operate in
eight of  South Africa ’s nine provinces, leaving Gold Circle with
only its KwaZulu-Natal business, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Sikonathi Mantshantsha in
