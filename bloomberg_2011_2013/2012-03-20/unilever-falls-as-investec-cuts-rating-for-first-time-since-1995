Unilever (UNA) , the world’s second-
biggest consumer-products maker, fell the most in a month in
Amsterdam trading after Investec Securities removed its “buy”
recommendation on the shares for the first time in 17 years.  The shares dropped as much as 1.6 percent, the  steepest 
intraday decline since Feb 24, and traded down 1.4 percent at
25.61 euros at 11 a.m.  Investec analyst  Martin Deboo  cut his recommendation to
“hold” today on concern about higher ingredients costs and
increased competition from  Procter & Gamble Co. (PG)  Deboo said he
expects operating profit margins to be little changed in 2012,
compared with his previous estimate of increased profitability.  Costs for commodities such as crude oil, palm oil, tea and
sugar will increase as much as 10 percent in 2012, higher than
the company’s forecast of about 5 percent, Deboo wrote in a
report. A $10 billion cost-cutting program announced last month
by P&G is a “direct threat” to Unilever, as it may lead to
price wars in  emerging markets  such as India, the analyst said.  “This reflects less a fundamental change of view, but more
a hard-nosed response to the threats of re-inflating commodities
and change afoot at P&G,” Deboo said in the note. “We
anticipate another year of slow grind in 2012. And grindstones
are never very comfortable places to sit.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
