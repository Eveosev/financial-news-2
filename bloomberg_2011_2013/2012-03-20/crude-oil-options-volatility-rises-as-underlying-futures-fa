Crude oil options volatility rose
as the underlying futures fell the most in three months after
 Saudi Arabia  said it has the ability to boost output immediately
to stave off shortages.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 25.4 percent as of 3 p.m. in  New York , up
from 24.3 percent in the previous session. The measure has
declined from 30.8 on March 6.  “The volatility firmed up a little on the down move but
overall, it is quite low,” said Ray Carbone, president of
Paramount Options Inc. in New York. “We’re stuck in the range
of about $104 to $110.”  Crude for May delivery fell $2.49, or 2.3 percent, to
settle at $106.07 on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Since
Feb. 21, the front-month contract has traded in a range of
$103.78 to $110.55.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
May $100 puts, with 3,692 lots changing hands as of 2:32 p.m.
They rose 40 cents to 98 cents a barrel. May $110 calls, the
second-most active options, fell 82 cents to $1.40 with 3,589
lots trading.  Calls accounted for 56 percent of electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Bullish options accounted for 56 percent of the 101,825
trades yesterday. May $140 calls were the most actively traded,
with 6,153 lots changing hands as they rose 1 cent to 13 cents a
barrel. The next-most-active options, May $95 puts, fell 13
cents to 21 cents on volume of 4,920.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 45,862
contracts. Next were December $150 calls with 38,604 lots and
