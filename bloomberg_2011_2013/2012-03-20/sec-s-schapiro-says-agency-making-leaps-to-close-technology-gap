The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission is updating the technology it uses to understand
operations at the financial firms it regulates and to catch
wrongdoing, said SEC Chairman  Mary Schapiro .  “We’ve begun to migrate our technology infrastructure into
the current decade,” Schapiro said in remarks prepared for a
Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association event
today in  Miami Beach ,  Florida . The SEC, she said, has been
behind other regulators in use of technology that may help the
agency analyze and search the information it gathers so that
“malefactors will find themselves trapped by more comprehensive
investigations.”  The SEC has also been working on a wide range of technology
upgrades to core areas, Schapiro said, such as the EDGAR
financial filing system used by all U.S.-listed companies, the
agency’s website and in the way it takes in and evaluates
enforcement tips. She said the agency is putting its latest
budget increase into new data-driven models will help the agency
target its investigations and exams.  Shapiro, who often says some large firms her agency
monitors spend more on technology than the SEC’s budget, told
House lawmakers at a March 6 budget hearing that she intended to
build “a data warehouse that is the single gold source of
information from all SEC systems, which then different
applications can pull data out of so that we don’t replicate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
