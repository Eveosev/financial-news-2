OAO  Uralkali (URKA)  extended gains in
Moscow trading after the world’s largest potash producer said
its trading arm signed a second-quarter supply contract with
 China  at $470 a metric ton, the same price as agreed in June
last year.  The shares climbed 2.3 percent to 229.12 rubles as of 5:18
p.m. in Moscow. A close at that level would mark their strongest
advance since March 11.  Belarusian Potash Co., as the trader is known, agreed to
ship 400,000 tons to China’s Sinochem and CNAMPGC under the
contact, with an option to ship 100,000 tons more, the Russian
producer said today in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
