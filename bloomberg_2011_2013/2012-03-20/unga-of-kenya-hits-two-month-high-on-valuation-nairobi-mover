Unga Group Ltd. (UNGL) , a Kenyan grain
miller, rose to its highest level in more than two months on
investor bets that its current price-to-earnings ratio makes the
stock attractive.  The stock gained 6.7 percent to 9.6 shillings, the
strongest since Jan. 16, by the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi.  “At its current valuation, Unga has obviously peaked
somebody’s interest,” Aly Khan Satchu, chief executive officer
of Nairobi-based investment company  Rich Management , said in a
phone interview today.  Unga has a price-to-earnings ratio of 2.69 while its peers
in other countries have a ratio of about 10, Satchu said.  In the year to June 30, net income climbed to 441.04
million shillings ($5.34 million), from 236.2 million shillings
a year earlier, the company said in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
