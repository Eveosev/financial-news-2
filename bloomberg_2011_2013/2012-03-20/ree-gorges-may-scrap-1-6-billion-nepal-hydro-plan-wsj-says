China Three Gorges Corp. may scrap
its proposed $1.6 billion hydro-dam in  Nepal  amid a probe to
determine whether the license for the project was awarded in
accordance to rules, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a
government spokesman for the South Asian nation.  Three Gorges has told the Nepalese government that the two
sides can mutually agree to end the project if matters aren’t
resolved, the newspaper said, citing Arjun Kumar Karki, joint
secretary in the policy and foreign-coordination section at the
energy ministry.  A shelving of the proposed 750-megawatt hydropower plant
would be the second overseas project in the region to be halted
in six months.  China Power Investment Corp.  said on March 12 it
is in talks with Myanmar on resuming a 6,000-megawatt project
suspended by the government in September following protests by
environmentalists and ethnic groups living near the site.  The decision whether to proceed with the project is up to
Nepal, the newspaper said, citing an official at Three Gorges
that it didn’t identify. Zhu Guangming, the company’s Beijing-
based spokesman, didn’t answer two telephone calls to his office
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
