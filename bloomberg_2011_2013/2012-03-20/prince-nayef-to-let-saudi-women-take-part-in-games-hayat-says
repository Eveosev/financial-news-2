Prince Nayef,  Saudi Arabia ’s
interior minister and crown prince, agreed to permit female
Saudi athletes to take part in the 2012 Olympics in  London , al-
Hayat reported, citing a report submitted to a Shoura Council
panel.  Approval applies to sports that suit the nature and decency
of women and don’t conflict with Islamic law teachings, the
London-based newspaper said, citing a report prepared by the
kingdom’s General Presidency of Youth Welfare.  The London Games start July 27. Saudi Arabia, Qatar and
Brunei haven’t included female athletes in their delegations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
