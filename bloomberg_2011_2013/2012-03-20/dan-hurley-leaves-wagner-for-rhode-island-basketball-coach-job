Dan Hurley is leaving  Wagner
College  to coach the  University of  Rhode Island  men’s basketball
team, which had its worst record in eight seasons with seven
wins.  Hurley, 39, will become the 19th head coach in Rams history,
Athletic Director Thorr Bjorn announced today in an e-mailed
release. He replaces Jim Baron, who was fired this month from
the Kingston, Rhode Island, school.  “Dan is a proven winner at every level and I am looking
forward to partnering with him to build on the solid foundation
we have in place,” Bjorn said. “Our goals are to compete for
and win Atlantic 10 championships and advance to play in NCAA
tournaments.”  Details of Hurley’s contract weren’t provided.  CBS Sports 
reported today on its website that Hurley had agreed on a six-
year deal.  Hurley is the son of  Basketball Hall of Fame  high school
coach Bob Hurley and brother of former Duke University point
guard Bobby Hurley, who was the National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament’s Most Outstanding Player in 1992. Bobby,
on Dan’s staff at Wagner, may follow him to Rhode Island, CBS
said.  Hurley’s team was 25-6 this season, his second at Wagner.
The Seahawks beat the  University of Pittsburgh , then ranked No.
15 in the Associated Press poll, on Dec. 23, and had four losses
to teams that made this year’s NCAA tournament --  Lehigh
University ,  the University of  Connecticut , and two to  Long
Island University, Brooklyn .  The Rams were 7-24 this season, the team’s worst season
since finishing 6-22 in 2004-05.  To contact the reporter on this story:
