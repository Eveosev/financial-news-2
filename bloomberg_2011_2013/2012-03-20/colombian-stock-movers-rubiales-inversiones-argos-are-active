The following companies had unusual
price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close of trading.  The  IGBC Index (IGBC)  fell 0.7 percent to 14,784.44, while the
Colcap Index gained 0.5 percent to 1,713.25.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE)  , the Toronto-based
oil producer that operates fields in Colombia, fell 4 percent to
50,180 pesos.  RBC Capital Markets cut its price target for Rubiales’s
Canadian shares to C$38 from C$39, citing factors including
exposure to Colombian security risks, sensitivity to
fluctuations in  oil prices  and political risks related to a
possible change in the country’s fiscal regime, according to an
e-mailed report today.  Inversiones Argos SA (INVARGOS)  , the owner of Colombia’s
biggest cement company, gained 6.2 percent, the most in a year,
to 16,560 pesos.  Investors may be speculating that  Colombia ’s securities
regulator will give final approval in coming days for a spinoff
in which the company will absorb assets of its Cementos Argos
unit, after the board announced a plan in October to do so, said
Jorge Zuniga, an analyst at Interbolsa SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
