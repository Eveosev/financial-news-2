Pacific Investment Management Co.’s
 Neel Kashkari , who heads global equities at the  Newport Beach ,
California-based investment firm, said Greece and Portugal will
need additional bailouts.  “We don’t think that Greece will actually be able to
deliver on the austerity measures they’re promising,” Kashkari
said today in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s
“InBusiness with Margaret Brennan.” “Risks in Europe remain,
so we’re being very selective.”  Europe’s approval of a 130 billion-euro ($172 billion)
rescue package for Greece, the second such bailout since 2010,
doesn’t solve the region’s sovereign-debt crisis, Kashkari said.
While U.S. economic indicators have been improving, risks of
further “shocks” coming out of Europe and slowing growth in
the emerging markets are leading Pimco to buy stocks only
selectively, he said.  Kashkari said he likes  Ensco Plc (ESV) , a London-based offshore
drilling company, and farm-equipment maker  Deere & Co. (DE) , based in
Moline, Illinois, because it sells to emerging-market consumers.  “We do think that China will have a soft landing,”
Kashkari said, citing Pimco’s forecast of 7 percent to 8 percent
real GDP growth in the country. “It’s still very strong growth
relative to the rest of the world.”  Pimco hired Kashkari, a former U.S. Treasury official, in
December 2009 to lead the expansion into equities and reduce its
dependence on traditional fixed-income strategies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
