Francois Hollande , the Socialist
candidate in France’s presidential election, risks isolating his
country if he insists on renegotiating Europe’s debt-limit pact,
said  Peter Altmaier , a senior ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel.  “As far as we are concerned, the negotiations on the
fiscal pact are closed,” said Altmaier, the majority whip for
Merkel’s  Christian Democrats . Twenty-five of the European
Union’s 27 leaders signed the German-inspired treaty on March 2,
he said. French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  was among them.  “I hope that Mr. Hollande won’t place himself outside this
broad consensus,” Altmaier told reporters in Berlin today. “He
would isolate France in Europe and that can’t be in anyone’s
interest.”  The treaty is due to take effect on Jan. 1, 2013, and must
be ratified by at least 12 euro-area countries out of the 17
members. All countries in the euro area and eight EU members
outside the currency bloc signed the pact.  Hollande has pledged to renegotiate the treaty. If elected,
the Socialists “won’t accept sanctions that are against
countries’ interests” and would add measures including joint
euro-area bonds, he said in a French television interview on
March 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
