JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the largest
and most profitable U.S. bank, dismissed about 5 percent of its
equities trading desk today, according to two people with
knowledge of the cuts.  William Gulya, an equity-derivatives sales representative
in  emerging markets , was among the departing employees,
according to the people, who asked for anonymity because
personnel matters are private. Data on the current size of the
equities trading staff wasn’t immediately available. The New
York-based bank ranks first by assets among U.S. lenders.  JPMorgan typically culls its workforce as part of periodic
staff reviews, according to one of the people.  Jennifer Zuccarelli , a spokeswoman for the bank, said she couldn’t
comment. Dealbreaker reported the job cuts earlier today, saying
they were closer to 10 percent of the trading floor.  The bank’s treasury and securities services division in
January dismissed about 100 people, less than 1 percent of the
unit’s workforce, as part of the bank’s periodic staff
adjustments, a person briefed on the move said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
