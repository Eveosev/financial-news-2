Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said he doesn’t think the Volcker rule ban on
proprietary trading will present a “meaningful risk” to
liquidity or credit availability in European countries.  “I don’t believe, that despite the concerns expressed by
governments and central banks, the rule as drafted presents a
meaningful risk to liquidity or credit in those countries,”
Geithner told the House Financial Services Committee today. He
said he’s confident U.S. regulators will find the “right
balance” in implementing the rule.  The Volcker rule, named for its original champion, former
Federal Reserve Chairman  Paul Volcker , is intended to reduce the
chance that banks will make risky investments with their own
capital that put depositors’ money at risk. The regulation is
one of the most contentious provisions of the 2010 Dodd-Frank
Act.  Officials from  Canada , Japan, the U.K. and the European
Banking Federation have said in letters to U.S. regulators that
the measure would harm global liquidity and international
cooperation.  Banks “shouldn’t be able to run internal hedge funds that
take a huge amount of risk relative to capital because that
could put us in a situation where their failures cause too much
damage to the innocent,” Geithner said. The rule also provides,
“appropriately so, some exemptions for market-making and for
hedging, things that they need to do.”  The restrictions on banks’ trading activities are scheduled
to take effect July 21. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben Bernanke 
said Feb. 29 that regulators probably won’t have the rule ready
in time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
