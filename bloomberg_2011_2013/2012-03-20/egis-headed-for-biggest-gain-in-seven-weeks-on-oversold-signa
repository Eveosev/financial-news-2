Egis Nyrt. (EGIS) , a Hungarian drugmaker
owned by Laboratoires Servier, headed for the biggest gain in
seven weeks as a technical indicator suggested the stock’s
decline was overdone.  The shares rose 2 percent to 15,000 forint by 1:25 p.m. in
Budapest, the biggest increase on a closing basis since Feb. 1.
The stock’s 2.5 percent slump yesterday pushed its 14-day
 relative strength index  to 25, the lowest since August. A
reading below 30 indicates to some technical analysts a security
may rise. The RSI last stood at 31.5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
