The U.S. Bureau of Land Management,
which is drafting rules for natural gas production by hydraulic
fracturing on federal property, said it will use industry
standards for cementing.  Cementing is the “most critical part of the drilling
operations,” Robert Abbey, director of the bureau, said in
testimony to the House Natural Resources Committee in  Washington 
today.  The rules, a draft of which the agency may release as early
as April for public comments, will adopt the American Petroleum
Institute standards for cementing, and require the driller to
prove the actual job was consistent with engineer’ drawings
provided before the work began, Abbey said.  Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is used in about 90
percent of wells on federal lands. It involves injecting
millions of gallons of water, chemicals and sand thousands of
feet underground to free oil and gas. The cement is used to seal
the outside of the steel pipe lining the well to the surrounding
rock so that oil and gas won’t seep up to the surface.  Companies using fracking include  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ,  Chevron
Corp. (CVX)  and  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)   To contact the reporter on this story:
