Developing  India ’s rupee into an
international currency isn’t a key strategic policy goal,
 Reserve Bank  of India Deputy Governor Subir Gokarn said.  “I don’t see it at this point as an explicit strategic
objective,” Gokarn said at a conference in New Delhi today. “The
focus of short- to medium-term policy on our capital-account
management is gradual liberalization.”  India’s rupee tumbled 16 percent against the dollar in
2011, the worst performance in Asia, as the nation’s growth
slowed and the central bank struggled to contain inflation.
While the currency has rebounded about 5.5 percent in 2012,
trade and fiscal deficits have stoked concern that India’s
 economic  outlook is deteriorating.  India “at this point” isn’t “looking at a very strategic
currency diversification,” Gokarn also said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
