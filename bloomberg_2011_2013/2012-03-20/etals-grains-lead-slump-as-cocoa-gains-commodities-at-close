The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities declined 1.5 percent to 701.53 at 4:35 p.m. in
 New York . Lead, silver and corn led the decline. Cocoa was the
biggest gainer.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials fell 1.3
percent to 1,626.213 at 4:40 p.m.  BASE METALS  Copper futures fell the most in two weeks as swelling
supplies and a slowing economy signaled slackening demand in
 China , the world’s biggest consumer.  Shanghai inventories at bonded warehouses not monitored by
the local futures exchange rose to 530,000 metric tons last
week, the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey showed.
That compares with 200,000 tons in the fourth quarter, said Qu Yi, an analyst at CRU International Ltd., a metal researcher.  Copper futures for May delivery dropped 2 percent to settle
at $3.8305 a pound at 1:15 p.m. on the Comex in New York, the

economy .  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months fell 1.6 percent to $8,430 a metric ton ($3.82 a pound).  Zinc, nickel aluminum, lead and tin also fell in London. A

weeks.  Base metals markets: {NI BMMKTS}  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold declined for the second time in three sessions on
concern that demand will drop in India and China, the world’s
biggest buyers. Silver also retreated.  China may reduce purchases as the economy slows and fuel
costs rise, according to  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath
Trading in Chicago. The country is set to displace  India  in 2012
as the top consumer, the World Gold Council said last month.
India’s demand may plunge 35 percent this year after the
government increased the gold-import tax, according to the
Bombay Bullion Association.  Gold futures for April delivery fell 1.2 percent to settle
at $1,647 an ounce at 1:43 p.m. on the Comex in New York. Last

$31.834 an ounce on the Comex, the lowest settlement since Jan.

delivery slid 1.5 percent to 697.05 an ounce. Platinum futures
