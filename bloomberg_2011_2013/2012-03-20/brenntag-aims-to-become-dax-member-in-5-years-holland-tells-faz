Brenntag AG (BNR)  Chief Executive Officer
Steven Holland said he would like to see the chemical
distributor join  Germany â€™s benchmark DAX index within five
years,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported, citing an
interview.  The German company, which has a market value of 4.5 billion
euros ($6 billion), needs to grow further and increase trading
in its shares, Holland said, according to the Frankfurt-based
newspaper.  Brenntag plans to grow by expanding its existing business
and through acquisitions, on which it spends 150 million euros
to 200 million euros a year, Holland told FAZ.  To contact the reporter on this story:
