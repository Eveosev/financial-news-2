The U.K. government’s so-called
Green Deal to insulate every home will double jobs in  energy
efficiency  by 2015, Climate Change Minister  Greg Barker  said.  The government is introducing new measures to cut
“prohibitive barriers to market entry” for small businesses
and setting up an advisory service from April 2 for consumers to
learn about renewable energy and energy efficiency incentives,
Barker said today at the Ecobuild conference in London.  The Green Deal, the centerpiece of the government’s energy
legislation, lays out incentives to insulate the nation’s 26
million homes as Britain strives to cut carbon dioxide emissions
by 34 percent from 1990 levels in 2020.  “The green deal will put energy efficiency at the heart of
government policy, bringing it into the mainstream,” Barker
said. “It is as much about economic growth as about narrow
climate change policy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
