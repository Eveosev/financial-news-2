The  Reserve Bank  of  Australia  is in
final consultations to revise standards and limit the surcharge
merchants can put on card transactions in order to better
reflect costs, central bank official Malcolm Edey said.  “The proposal preserves the original goal of giving
merchants the right to recover their costs,” Edey, an RBA
assistant governor, said in the text of a speech in Sydney
today. It “will allow schemes to limit surcharging to a
reasonable cost of acceptance, but schemes will not be able to
prohibit surcharging altogether,” he said.  Edey said that polling shows only 12 percent of merchants
say they aren’t at least considering applying a surcharge. He
cited anecdotal evidence of surcharging not reasonably related
to the cost of acceptance.  “One example is the practice of blended surcharging, where
a merchant might be recovering costs on an average basis without
distinguishing between high- and low-cost card payments,” he
said. “Another would be where a surcharge simply exceeds any
reasonable estimate of the cost of acceptance.”  Edey, who didn’t address monetary policy or the nation’s
economy in the text of the speech, said the RBA isn’t setting
itself up as a regulator of merchant behavior.  “What the proposed standard does is to empower the schemes
to take action where surcharging is clearly excessive,” he
said. “It will be in their own interests to make use of this
power.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
