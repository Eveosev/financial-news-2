A pressure-reduction station in
southwest  England  will be completed early in the winter heating
season, allowing maximum pipeline flows from liquefied natural
gas terminals in Wales, National Grid Plc said.  Full capacity for the station at Tirley, Gloucestershire,
will be about 88 million cubic meters of gas a day, the grid
manager said. An earlier rejection of planning permission meant
that the pipeline carrying gas from the Dragon and South Hook
LNG terminals in south Wales was limited to 80 percent of
capacity.  “It’s all on target,” Caroline Davidson, a National Grid
spokeswoman in Tirley, said by telephone. “Commissioning will
be late autumn, early winter.” The winter heating season in
Britain,  Europe ’s biggest gas market, begins on Oct. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
