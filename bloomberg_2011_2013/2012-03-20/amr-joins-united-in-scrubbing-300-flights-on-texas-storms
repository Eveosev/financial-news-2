American Airlines (AAMRQ)  and its American
Eagle regional unit canceled 192 flights at the Dallas- Fort
Worth  airport due to thunderstorms, while  United Continental
Holdings Inc. (UAL)  scrubbed 110 flights at its Houston hub.  Lightning forced ramp shutdowns for about four hours early
today at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, said Mary
Frances Fagan, a spokeswoman for Fort Worth, Texas-based
American. The airline dropped 162 flights and Eagle cut 30, she
said.  Cancellations by United and its regional carriers led to
some arrival delays and diversions at other Texas cities,
including Dallas and San Antonio, said Mary Ryan, a spokeswoman.
Chicago-based United’s dropped flights consisted of 95 on its
main jet operations and 15 by regional partners, she said.  “The weather is moving on now and we’re looking to get
back on track” in the coming hours, she said before midday
Chicago time.  Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV)  scrapped three flights at its
hometown base at Dallas Love Field and 10 flights at Houston’s
Hobby airport, said  Brad Hawkins , a spokesman for the discount
carrier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
