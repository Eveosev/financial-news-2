Argentine truck arrivals at grain
ports fell amid a truckers’ strike over pay that began
yesterday, disrupting exports from the South American country,
 data  from the Rosario Cereals Exchange shows.  Only 26 trucks arrived at grain ports on  Argentina ’s Parana
River today, compared with 4,834 on the same day a year ago, the
exchange said on its website. Truck arrivals are down 14 percent
so far this year, compared with the same period in 2011.  The grain-truckers’ strike will continue today after its
union known as  FETRA  failed to reach an agreement with the
government over rates and payment schedules in talks yesterday,
union president Ovidio Rodriguez wrote on its website.  The truckers’ dispute adds to a dockworkers’ strike that
disrupted the flow of corn and soybeans from the cluster of
grain ports operated by Cargill Inc.,  Bunge Ltd. (BG)  and Archer-
Daniels Midland Co. near Rosario, Argentina that account for
more than 80 percent of the country’s grain and oilseed exports.  Argentina is the world’s second-largest corn exporter
behind the U.S. and the third-largest in soybeans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
