Shareholders of  State Bank of
India , the nation’s largest by assets, approved a plan to shore
up the lender’s capital by raising 79 billion rupees ($1.57
billion) from the sale of equity to the government.  The  state-owned  bank has decided to sell more than 36
million  shares (SBIN)  to the government on a preferential basis at
2,191.69 rupees apiece, according to a filing to stock
exchanges. The lender has been seeking funds for more than two
years to boost its capital ratio depleted by increased
provisions for soured loans and credit growth.  Shares of  State Bank  rallied 35 percent this year on
speculation the capital would be infused in the first quarter.
The lender had informed the bourses on Jan. 30 that it would
receive as much as 79 billion rupees.  “Finally their wait for capital is over and can grow
lending book with minimal concerns of squeeze on capital,”
Nitin Kumar, a banking analyst at Mumbai-based Quant Broking
Ltd., said in a telephone interview today.  The investment may push the bank’s Tier I capital ratios
above 9 percent by March, Pratip Chaudhuri, chairman, State Bank
of  India  said on Feb. 13.  State Bank climbed 1.4 percent, snapping a three-day loss,
to 2,187.35 rupees in Mumbai. The stock’s advance this year
compares with the 12 percent gain in the benchmark  Sensitive
Index. (SENSEX)   Last week India announced plans to invest as much as 158.9
billion rupees in state-run banks for the year ending March 2013
as it sought to bolster risk buffers and boost credit growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
