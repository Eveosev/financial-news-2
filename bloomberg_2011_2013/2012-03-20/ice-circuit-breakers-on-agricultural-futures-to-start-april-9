IntercontinentalExchange Inc. plans
to use “circuit breakers” effective April 9 in markets for
sugar, coffee and other agricultural futures to curb wide price
swings.  The so-called interval price limit “acts as a temporary
circuit-breaker feature on the electronic platform to diminish
the likelihood and extent of short-term price spikes or aberrant
market moves” on  ICE (ICE)  Futures U.S., the Atlanta-based parent
company said today in a  statement . ICE futures in raw sugar,
arabica coffee, cocoa, cotton and orange juice trade only
electronically.  A band of limits will prevent a contract from trading above
or below an anchor price by more than a specific amount over
short intervals, according to ICE.  The interval price limits started on March 12 in currency
and equity contracts, partly in compliance with government
rules.  ICE also offers agriculture options that people trade on
the exchange floor or online.  To contact the reporter on this story:
