European Union foreign-policy chief
 Catherine Ashton  said a “distortion” is at the root of Israeli
criticism of her reaction to yesterday’s killing of four people
outside a Jewish school in southern  France .  “I’m really saddened of the distortion of my remarks,”
Ashton told a European Parliament committee in Brussels today.
“I condemn unreservedly the terrible murders. I drew no
parallel whatsoever between this tragedy and events elsewhere in
the Middle East.”  Ashton faced Israeli rebukes today for a speech in which
she listed the French school shooting along with “what is
happening in Gaza,” last week’s bus crash in Switzerland and
the 2011 mass murder at a Norwegian youth outing as examples of
tragedies involving children.  Seizing on the Gaza reference, Israeli Prime Minister
 Benjamin Netanyahu  said Ashton compared “the premeditated
slaughter of children to the defensive surgical activities of
the  Israel Defense Forces  aimed at hitting terrorists who use
children as shields.”  EU aides have since posted an  updated version  of
yesterday’s speech on Ashton’s website that adds a reference to
Palestinian rocket attacks on the southern Israeli city of
Sderot.  To contact the reporter on this story:
