South Africa , the biggest corn
producer on the continent, may lower its forecast for the crop
to 11.35 million metric tons when the Crop Estimates Committee
announces its projection on March 27.  Estimates from eight traders surveyed by Bloomberg ranged
from 11 million to 11.6 million with the median seeing output
fall from the previous estimate of 11.7 million tons. About 10.8
million tons of corn was produced last season.  Farmers may harvest 11.35 million tons, including 6.5
million tons of white corn and 4.67 million tons of the yellow
variety, according to the survey. White and yellow corn for July
delivery surged the most in two weeks yesterday, as a drought in
the countryâ€™s main production areas may cut maize stocks this
season.  White corn increased 0.6 percent to 2,246.80 rand ($295) a
ton by the noon close in Johannesburg, while the yellow variety
was unchanged at 2,180 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
