A  Wisconsin  judge refused to halt
enforcement of his ruling that the state’s voter identification
law is unconstitutional.  Wisconsin Circuit Judge Richard G. Niess in Madison today
denied a request by Attorney General J.B.  Van Hollen  and the
state agency that administers elections to enforce the ID law
while they appeal his March 12 decision that it burdened
otherwise qualified voters with a statutory requirement not
found in the state’s constitution.  “An unconstitutional law is void ab initio,” Niess wrote,
using a Latin phrase meaning from the inception. “It is as if
it never existed. Therefore there can be no justification for
enforcement.”  Signed into law by Governor Scott K. Walker in May, the
measure required voters to present a government-issued
photographic form of identification at their polling place such
as a driver’s license, passport or military or college ID,
before being permitted to vote.  Wisconsin is scheduled to hold its spring election and
presidential primary on April 3.  Dana Brueck, a spokeswoman for Van Hollen, said he will
seek similar relief from the state’s intermediate-level
appellate court. The attorney general has already asked that
court for permission to take his challenge directly to the
state’s  Supreme Court .  The case is League of Women Voters of Wisconsin v. Walker,
11cv4669,  Dane County , Wisconsin, Circuit Court (Madison).  To contact the reporter on this story:
