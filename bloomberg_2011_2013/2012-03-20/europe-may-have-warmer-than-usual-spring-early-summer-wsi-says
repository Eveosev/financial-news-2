Europe  may have warmer-than-normal
weather from April through June, forecaster Weather Services
International said.  The Nordic region and the northern mainland of Europe will
have above-average temperatures in the second quarter of 2012,
while the U.K. and the southern mainland will have a cooler-
than-usual April before temperatures rise to above-normal values
in May and June, the Andover, Massachusetts-based forecaster
said in an  online report  yesterday.  “As we head into April, we expect most of Europe to
continue to have higher-than-normal temperatures,”  Todd Crawford , chief meteorologist, wrote in the report. “We expect
a drier summer in the U.K. and Nordic regions.”  The lack of North Atlantic blocking is likely to result in
“greater chances for summer heat in western and northern
sections,” according to WSI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
