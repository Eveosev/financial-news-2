Millers in  Brazil , the world’s
largest sugar producer, may switch to making ethanol at the
expense of the sweetener if prices for both commodities continue
to approach similar levels, Societe General SA said.  Domestic sugar sales in Brazil were last week 32 percent
more profitable than anhydrous ethanol, the type blended into
gasoline, according to Cepea, a university of Sao Paulo research
group. Local sugar sales were 35 percent more advantageous last
week than the hydrous kind, used in flex-fuel cars. That
compares with a 40 percent advantage in the week ended March 2
for both types, the data show.  “Sugar and ethanol prices have slowly begun trending back
to parity, suggesting that more cane could be diverted to
ethanol production,”  Michael Haigh , the New York-based global
head of commodities research at the French bank, said in a
report e-mailed yesterday. “If prices continue to trend towards
parity, we would expect to see a greater shift and less sugar
available for both consumption and global trade.”  Both sugar and ethanol are made from raw material sugar
cane in the South American country. Higher prices for sugar have
resulted in millers favoring production of the sweetener over
the past year. A switch to ethanol could add “upside risk to
sugar prices,” Haigh wrote in the report.  Raw sugar will average 24.5 cents a pound in the first
quarter and 23 cents a pound in the second, before recovering to
23.9 cents a pound in the third and 24 cents a pound in the
fourth, Societe Generale estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
