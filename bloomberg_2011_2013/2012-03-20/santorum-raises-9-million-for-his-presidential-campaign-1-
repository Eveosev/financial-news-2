Republican front-runner Mitt Romney
raised $12 million last month, more than any of his contenders,
and entered March with $7.3 million to spend, Federal Election
Commission reports show.  Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, has taken in $75.6
million for his presidential bid, more than the rest of the
Republican field combined. He has spent $68.3 million on his
campaign, including $12.4 million last month. He reported his
latest campaign-finance figures yesterday, the day he won the
Illinois Republican primary.  Registered lobbyists brought in $545,005 for the campaign
in February, FEC records show. Romney added Dirk Van Dongen,
president of the National Association of Wholesaler-
Distributors, who had been raising money for Texas Governor  Rick Perry . Van Dongen, who raised more than $500,000 for 2008
Republican presidential nominee  John McCain , brought in $22,500
for Romney last month.  Edward Ingle, a  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  lobbyist, raised $41,355.
Microsoft employees and their families are the top contributors
to President Barack Obama’s re-election, according to the Center
for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based research group.  Romney is required by federal law to list those fundraisers
who are registered lobbyists. He doesn’t release his other
bundlers, nor do any other Republican candidates. Obama is the
only presidential candidate who publicly identifies those
raising at least $50,000 for the campaign.  Santorum’s Haul  Republican rival  Rick Santorum  took in $9 million in
February, bringing his campaign fundraising to $15.7 million. He
had $2.6 million in the bank at the end of the month.  Santorum, a former U.S. senator from  Pennsylvania ,
collected 53 percent of his money in contributions of $200 or
less last month. He spent almost $8 million in February,
including repaying $20,000 that he lent his campaign, for total
expenditures of $13.1 million. He owed $922,448, including
$489,304 for media and $293,973 for Internet services.  Former U.S. House Speaker  Newt Gingrich  of Georgia raised
$2.6 million in February, bringing his total to $20.9 million.
He spent $2.9 million last month and $19.4 million in total.
Gingrich finished the month with $1.5 million in the bank and
about the same amount in debt, including almost $200,000 for
consulting, $184,302 for media and $119,045 in legal fees.  U.S. Representative  Ron Paul  of Texas reported on March 16
that he had raised $3.3 million last month and had $1.4 million
in the bank. He has raised $34.4 million for his campaign. He
spent $3.5 million in February and $33 million overall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
