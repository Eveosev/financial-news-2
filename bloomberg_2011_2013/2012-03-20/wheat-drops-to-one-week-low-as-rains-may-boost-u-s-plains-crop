Wheat futures fell to a one-week
low on signs that rains in the U.S. Great Plains this month have
improved prospects of winter crops emerging from dormancy.  Fifty-four percent of the crop in  Kansas  was in good or
excellent condition as of March 18, up from 53 percent a week
earlier, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said yesterday.
Conditions in  Oklahoma  and  Texas  also improved. Northeast Texas,
south-central and eastern Oklahoma and southeast  Kansas  got as
much as 3.5 inches (8.9 centimeters) of rain since yesterday,
and showers may linger until March 22, Telvent DTN forecast.  “We’re pressured by the forecast for rain in the winter-
wheat belt,” Brian Hoops, the president of Midwest Market
Solutions in Springfield, Missouri, said in a telephone
interview. The rain “is exactly” what the crop needs, “as
long as we don’t get any low-level type flooding,” he said.  Wheat futures for May delivery fell 1.2 percent to $6.4425
a bushel at 10:29 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade, after
reaching $6.40, the lowest since March 12.  Wheat is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $14.4
billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
