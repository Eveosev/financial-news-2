Enka Insaat & Sanayi AS (ENKAI) , a builder
with operations in  Russia , rose after reporting profit climbed
3.8 percent to 849.6 million liras ($471 million) last year.  The shares increased 2 percent to 5.20 liras, its highest
since Feb. 8, while the Istanbul Stock Exchange National 100
Index fell 0.6 percent, the measure’s first decline in six days.  Enka’s results showed a “basic improvement in the
company’s financials” from its rent and energy businesses, “as
a result of an increase in rents, especially in the Russian
Federation, along with an increase in electricity prices,”
Hakan Aklar, chief economist for Istanbul-based brokerage Ak
Investment, said in an e-mailed note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
