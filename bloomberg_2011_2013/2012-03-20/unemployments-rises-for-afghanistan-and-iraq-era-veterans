The  unemployment rate  for U.S.
veterans who’ve served during the wars in Iraq and  Afghanistan 
increased last year, while the rate for non-veterans declined,
the Labor Department reported yesterday.  The jobless rate for veterans who were in service following
the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks was 12.1 percent last year, up from
11.5 percent in 2010, the department’s data show. Among all non-
veterans, 8.7 percent were jobless last year, down from 9.4
percent in 2010.  “This is a national security issue,” Kevin Schmiegel,
vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s veterans
employment program, said in an interview. “What happens to the
all-volunteer force? We’re not going to be able to recruit
enough people to serve in the military if we don’t do something
now.”  The chamber, the largest U.S. business lobbying group,
created a “Hiring Our Heroes” campaign last year, which has
held more than 100 job fairs in at least 45 states and the
 District of Columbia . The chamber plans to hold 400 fairs by
2014.  Even with such efforts, concern has grown that post-Sept.
11 veterans will continue to struggle with unemployment,
particularly as the Pentagon prepares to bring more troops home
from Afghanistan and to shed 123,900 troops by fiscal 2017.  “This is a problem that I worry about a great deal,”
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said at a Feb. 14 hearing of the
Senate Armed Services Committee. “And frankly, it’s one of the
risks involved as we reduce the budget by this level, is how to
ensure that we take care of those that are returning.”  Tax Credits  The report, issued a day after President  Barack Obama 
declared “A National Day of Honor” to commemorate the return
of U.S. forces from Iraq, underscores the importance of
“initiatives to increase employment among veterans,” Labor
Secretary Hilda Solis said in a statement.  Legislation signed last year by Obama provides tax credits
of as much as $5,600 for employers who hire a veteran who has
been unemployed more than six months. The credit rises to as
much as $9,600 for hiring a disabled veteran.  Obama also is seeking $1 billion over five years to develop
a Veterans Job Corps that would hire as many as 20,000 veterans
to work on conservation projects.  Among all veterans, including those who served before the
wars in  Iraq  and Afghanistan, the jobless rate dropped slightly
to 8.3 percent last year from 8.7 percent in 2010.  The figures compiled by the Labor Department were obtained
from the Current Population Survey, a monthly sample survey of
about 60,000 households that provide employment information in
the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
