Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR) 
dropped the most in two weeks after the second-largest U.S. coal
producer said its founder Michael Quillen will retire as
chairman.  Alpha fell 4.2 percent to $16.60 at 10:59 a.m. in  New York .
Earlier it declined as much as 6.3 percent, the biggest intraday
drop since March 5.  Chief Executive Officer Kevin Crutchfield will succeed
Quillen following Alphaâ€™s May 17 annual meeting, the Bristol,
Virginia-based company said today in a statement.  Quillen, 63, formed Alpha in 2002 and led it through an
initial public offering three years later and more than 12
subsequent mergers and acquisitions, the company said in the
statement. Quillen has served as chairman since 2006.  Alpha bought Massey Energy Co. for about $6.66 billion in
June. Coal prices have declined since then after some U.S.
utilities switched to natural gas to generate electricity. Alpha
said in February it will reduce output by about 2.5 million tons
a year of thermal coal and 1.5 million tons of lower-quality
metallurgical coal.  Power companies burn thermal coal while metallurgical coal
is used as a raw material in steel blast furnaces.  Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU)  is the largest U.S. coal producer by
revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
