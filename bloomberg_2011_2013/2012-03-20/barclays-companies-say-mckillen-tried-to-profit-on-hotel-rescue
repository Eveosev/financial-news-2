Patrick McKillen, the developer
suing David and  Frederick Barclay , sought a $5 million-pound
($7.9 million) annual fee as part of a failed bid to use Qatari
investors to restructure the debt of three luxury London hotels,
lawyers for the Barclays’ companies said.  McKillen was questioned on the second day of the London
trial about his efforts as the director of Coroin Ltd., the
owner of  Claridge’s , the  Berkeley  and the  Connaught , to find a
solution to its 660-million-pound debt in 2010 and 2011.  The proposed fee for McKillen to stay on if Qatari
investors took a majority stake “was really an inducement to
sell your shares,” said Kenneth Maclean, who represents the
Barclays’ companies. McKillen said the money was for hotel
refurbishment. “This was a budgeted fee for future work,” he
told the court.  Coroin is worth more than 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion),
according to McKillen, who owns 36 percent of it. The Barclays
bought 800 million euros ($1.06 billion) of its debt last year
from Ireland’s National Asset Management Agency, the so-called
“bad bank” which houses distressed loans resulting from the
country’s property crash.  McKillen says the brothers acted dishonorably in trying to
acquire the hotels and is seeking a court ruling that he has the
right to buy the remaining shares in Coroin. His lawyers argued
the Barclays intend to divide up the company and sell the 200-
year-old Claridge’s and the other hotels.  The Barclays, who own  London ’s Daily Telegraph newspaper,
won’t appear at the trial.  To contact the reporter on this story:
