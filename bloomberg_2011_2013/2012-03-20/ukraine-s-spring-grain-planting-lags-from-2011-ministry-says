Ukraine’s farmers planted 8,800
hectares (21,745 acres) with spring grains as of yesterday, said
Mykola Prysyazhnyuk, agriculture minister.  The planting, which is off to a late start due to cold
weather, compares with about 113,300 hectares in same period
last year, according to the Kiev-based Agriculture Ministry’s
website. The planting started in Crimea, Prysyazhnyuk said in an
e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
