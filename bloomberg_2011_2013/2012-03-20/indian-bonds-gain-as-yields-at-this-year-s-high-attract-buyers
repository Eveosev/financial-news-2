India ’s bonds advanced for a second
day on speculation yields at the highest level this year are
luring buyers.  Yields on government notes due 2021 jumped 20 basis points
this month as the government plans to borrow a record 5.69
trillion rupees ($113 billion) fiscal year beginning April 1, a
12 percent increase over this year. Investors are probably
adding to their holdings as no auction is due this month,
according to R.S. Chauhan, chief dealer of fixed-income and
currencies at  State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur. (SBBJ)   “Bonds have gained slightly because yields have jumped
quite a bit this month,” Mumbai-based Chauhan said.  The yield on the 8.79 percent bonds due November 2021 was
8.41 percent in Mumbai, compared with 8.42 percent yesterday,
according to the central bank’s trading system. The rate reached
8.43 percent earlier, matching the level touched on March 16,
the highest since Dec. 30.  One-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.20 percent, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
