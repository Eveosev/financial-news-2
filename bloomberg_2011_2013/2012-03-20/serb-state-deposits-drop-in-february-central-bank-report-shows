Serbia spent 30.9 billion dinars
($369.2 million) of its foreign currency and dinar reserves kept
with the central bank in February to finance the budget after
freezing a program with the  International Monetary Fund .  Both dinar and foreign exchange deposits fell to the lowest
since August 2011, a month before Serbia sold a $1 billion
debut, 10-year Eurobond, according to central bank data. The
foreign-currency deposits, calculated in dinars, dropped by 15.8
billion dinars to 82.382 billion dinars at the end of February.
Dinar deposits shrank by 15.1 billion dinars to 44.2 billion.  The government tapped the assets it holds with the
Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije last month, when its
domestic market borrowing began to falter after the IMF and
Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic agreed to freeze a $1.3 billion
precautionary loan program until a new government is formed
after May 6 parliamentary elections.  The government borrowed 30.5 billion dinars in all debt
tenors that ranged between six months and three years, falling
short of a planned sale of 51 billion dinars in February. It
also sold 55.2 million euros ($72.75 million) worth of 53-week
euro-denominated Treasury-bills of 120-million euros for sale.  The government has not yet published its budget data for
February, after reporting a shortfall of 10.4 billion dinars in
January. Serbia would need to contain its three-month fiscal
deficit within 26 billion dinars, allowing it to expand to 61
billion dinars through end-June, to prove that its policies
remain broadly on track with the frozen IMF program.  Serbiaâ€™s fiscal gap is estimated to widen to 5.25 percent
of GDP this year if the government fails to generate  tax revenue 
to cover spending increases, the Belgrade-based FREN economic
research institute said in a March 19 report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
