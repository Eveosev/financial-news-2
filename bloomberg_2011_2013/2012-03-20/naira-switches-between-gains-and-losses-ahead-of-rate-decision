Nigeria ’s naira appreciated for a
second day after the central bank held its  benchmark interest
rate  at a record high to keep the currency stable.  The currency of  Africa ’s largest oil producer gained 0.1
percent to 160.75 per dollar as of 2:50 p.m. in Lagos the
commercial capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank kept its  interest rate  unchanged at 12
percent for a fifth consecutive meeting, in line with 12 out of
13  economists surveyed  by Bloomberg News. Inflation accelerated
to 12.9 percent in June, from 12.7 percent in May, the Abuja-
based National Bureau of Statistics said July 18.  “Retaining the policy rate at 12 percent will enhance the
ability of the central bank to support the naira and curb
inflationary threat,” Sewa Wusu, a currency analyst at Lagos-
based Sterling Capital Ltd., said by phone today. “I think the
bank’s decision is positive, with all the pressure on the naira
recently.”  The yield on Nigeria’s 7-year domestic bonds due June 2019
fell 12 basis points to 16.05 percent, according to July 23 data
on the Financial Markets Dealers Association website. Yields on
the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due 2021 fell five basis
points to 5.459 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi depreciated 0.2 percent to 1.9575 per dollar
in Accra, the capital, the lowest since at least 1993.
