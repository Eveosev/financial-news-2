Hungary’s benchmark BUX stock index
fell 0.1 percent to 19,232.77 as of the close in Budapest. The
following were among the most active equities in the Hungarian
market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  CIG Pannonia Eletbiztosito Nyrt. (PANNONIA HB), a Hungarian
life insurance company, slumped to a record low after asking
investors to authorize a capital increase. The shares plunged as
much as 6.7 percent and last traded 2.8 percent lower at 451
forint, the lowest since the stock’s listing in November 2010.  Egis Nyrt. (EGIS)  , a Hungarian drugmaker owned by
Laboratoires Servier, gained the most in seven weeks as a
technical indicator suggested the stock’s decline was overdone.
The shares rose 1.7 percent to 14,950 forint, the biggest jump
since Feb. 2. The stock’s 2.5 percent slump yesterday pushed its
14-day relative strength index to 25, the lowest since August. A
reading below 30 indicates to some technical analysts a security
may rise. The RSI last stood at 31.5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
