Kenya’s NSE  20 share index (KNSMIDX)  declined
for a seventh day, the longest losing streak in more than three
months, as investors booked gains from a rally inspired by
banks’ year-end results.  The benchmark 20 Share Index slid 1 percent to 3285.51
points by the close of trading in Nairobi, the capital,
according to data from the Nairobi Securities Exchange. The
retreat was preceded by a 14-day rally, the longest since 2007,
that added 7 percent to the index, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “We attribute the decline to profit taking and the fact
that we are over the banking announcement season,” Renaldo d’Souza, a research analyst with Genghis Capital Ltd., said in a
phone interview today. “The rally was inspired by the banks’
reporting season mainly.”  Over the past month publicly traded Kenyan lenders
announced their full-year earnings through to December with
 Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd., (KNCB)  the biggest lender by assets,
reporting a 53 percent advance in net income to 11 billion
shillings ($133.1 million).  “Earnings that have been reported by listed companies have
been very good, reflecting the resilience of businesses,” Peter Mwangi, chief executive officer of the Nairobi Securities
Exchange, said in an interview today.  “After a rally there
will always be some profit taking by short-term investors.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
