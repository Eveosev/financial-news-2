Mauritius may face inflationary
pressure from the rising cost of imported fuel and foods, Bank
of Mauritius Governor Rundheersing Bheenick said.  “The first concern is the energy cost,” he told reporters
today in  Port Louis , the capital. “With what’s happening in the
Gulf and  Iran , there might be an inflationary pressure coming.”
The food price index of the  Food and Agriculture Organization  is
at its second highest in five years, he said.  As the world economy gathers pace, price pressures might
come from the fuel and food components, he said, resulting in
imported inflation.  Mauritius, an Indian Ocean island nation of 1.3 million
people, is a net buyer of fuels and food, which represented
almost 40 percent of the country’s imports last year. Bills for
fuel and lubricants increased by 25 percent to 31.9 billion
rupees ($1.1 billion) in 2011 compared with a year earlier,
Statistics Mauritius said in a Feb. 28  report , while the cost of
food imports rose 9.4 percent  Inflation declined to 4.1 percent in February, according to
the data agency, a 15-month low. The economy expanded 4 percent
in 2011 compared with a 4.1 percent forecast, and is seen to
grow 3.8 percent this year, according to Bheenick. With a view
to spurring growth, the central bank’s monetary policy committee
cut its benchmark  interest rate  by 50 basis points to 4.9
percent yesterday.  The rupee appreciated 0.3 percent to 29.1 per dollar by
2:35 p.m., in Port Louis. The dollar is the main currency for
the country’s import bills.  To contact the reporter on this story:
