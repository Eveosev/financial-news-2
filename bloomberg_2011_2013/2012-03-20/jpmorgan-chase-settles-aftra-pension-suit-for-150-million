JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  will pay
$150 million to settle a lawsuit claiming losses from the bank’s
securities lending program, according to court papers.  The suit was filed by three union pension funds, which
represented a class of all investors in a group of structured
debt securities. The settlement was announced last month. The
parties disclosed the terms of the agreement in a filing in
Manhattan federal court March 16.  The funds claim they lost money that New York-based
JPMorgan invested for them in medium-term notes issued by Sigma
Finance Corp., a structured investment vehicle that collapsed in
2008.  The union pension funds representing the class are the
AFTRA Retirement Fund, the Imperial County Employees’ Retirement
System and the Investment Committee of the  Manhattan  and Bronx
Surface Transit Operating System.  The settlement must be approved by a judge before it can
take effect.  The case is Board of Trustees of the AFTRA Retirement Fund
v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 09-cv-686, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
