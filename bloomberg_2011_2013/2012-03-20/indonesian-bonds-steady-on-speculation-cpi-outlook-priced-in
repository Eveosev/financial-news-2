Indonesia ’s bonds and rupiah were
little changed on speculation yields near a two-month high
factor in faster inflation forecast by the central bank.  The government sold 7.3 trillion rupiah ($797 million) of
local-currency notes and bills at an auction today, exceeding
its target of 6 trillion rupiah, according to a statement from
the debt management office. The yield on the 7 percent
securities due May 2022 has surged 75 basis points since Feb. 22
to an eight-week high of 6.02 percent last week, when President
Bambang Susilo Yudhoyono said fuel prices need to be raised.  “We see that the bond markets have priced in inflation
expectations,” said Artanavaro Gasali, Jakarta-based head of
global markets at PT Bank ICBC Indonesia.  The yield on the 10-year bonds rose two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 5.91 percent as of the close in
Jakarta, according to prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association.  The rupiah traded at 9,173 per dollar, compared with 9,176
yesterday, according to prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency’s one-month implied volatility, which
measures exchange-rate swings used to price options, held at
8.25 percent, the lowest level since Feb. 15.  Increases in consumer prices may measure 6.8 percent if the
government revises energy costs, Bank Indonesia Governor Darmin
Nasution said on March 8. The consumer-price index climbed 3.56
percent in February from a year earlier, the least in 23 months.  To contact the reporters on this story:
