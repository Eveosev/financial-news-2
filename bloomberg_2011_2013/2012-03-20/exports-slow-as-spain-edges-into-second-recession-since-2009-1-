The rise in Spanish  export s slowed
in January, undermining the only growth driver left to the euro
region’s fourth-biggest economy as the strictest austerity push
in decades tips it into a second  recession  since 2009.  Exports grew 3.9 percent from a year earlier in January,
compared with 6.6 percent in December, and 32 percent last year,
the  Economy Ministry  said in an e-mailed statement today.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s People’s Party government
overhauled Spanish labor rules on Feb. 10, making it easier for
companies to cut payroll in times of downturn. The move seeks to
improve competitiveness while efforts to cut the euro region’s
fourth-largest  budget gap  weigh on demand.  The government forecasts domestic demand will shrink 4
percent in 2012, more than four times last year’s rate. Public
spending is seen contracting 11.5 percent after 2.2 percent last
year, while a 24.3 percent unemployment rate will push household
spending down 1.4 percent, after a 0.1 percent drop in 2011.  The economy will contract 1.7 percent as export growth
slows to 3.4 percent this year from 9 percent last year and 13.5
percent in 2010, the government said on March 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
