Russia ’s state debt relative to
economic output will be less than forecast in 2014, according to
a marketing presentation for the government’s sale of sovereign
Eurobonds obtained by Bloomberg News.  Debt as a percentage of gross domestic product will
increase to 15.7 percent by the end of 2014 from 9.8 percent
last year, according to the document, prepared by Russia’s
 Finance Ministry  and the central bank. The Finance Ministry said
in August that debt would rise to as much as 17 percent in 2014.  Russia is meeting U.S. and U.K. investors this month to
market its first international bonds in almost a year. The
government last sold international bonds denominated in rubles
in May and hasn’t issued dollar debt since April 2010. The
world’s largest energy exporter had the lowest government debt-
to-GDP ratio among all investment-grade sovereigns in 2011,
Moody’s Investors Service said Feb. 29.  “Budget oil-price assumptions have traditionally been
conservative and hence consistently below the actual average oil
price,” the authors of the government report wrote. The break-
even oil price is expected to start declining after growing
“substantially” in recent years.  The average crude oil price needed to balance the budget
will drop from $117 a barrel this year to $113 next year and
$107 in 2014, according to the document.  The government predicts its  budget deficit  will narrow to
0.7 percent of GDP in 2014, from a projected 1.5 percent
shortfall this year, according to the presentation. Next year’s
budget gap is forecast at 1.6 percent.  Oil Funds  By 2014, the  Reserve Fund  is projected to exceed the 2008
peak and total 4.2 trillion rubles ($141 billion), the
government estimates. The National Wellbeing Fund will reach 2.8
trillion rubles. In August, the Finance Ministry projected the
Reserve Fund at 1.6 trillion rubles and the National Wealth Fund
at 2.6 trillion rubles by 2014. Russia stows away its oil wealth
in the two sovereign wealth funds.  Domestic demand will be the “key growth driver” through
2014 as the economy expands an estimated 3.7 percent to 4.4
percent per year, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
