Kenya ’s shilling weakened, paring
yesterday’s gains, on increased demand for dollars by businesses
looking to capitalize on the currency’s strength.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated
as much as 0.3 percent and traded 0.1 percent weaker at 82.55 by
1:04 p.m. in Nairobi. The shilling stood at 82.13 per dollar on
March 13, its highest level in more than a year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The shilling has weakened on increased demand as
businesses accumulate the recent gains it had made,” Bernard Matimu, chief dealer at Nairobi based  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB) , said in a
phone interview today.  Tanzania’s shilling moved between gains and losses,
weakening as much as 0.6 percent and trading 0.1 percent lower
at 1,595 per dollar as of 1:26 p.m. The curency’s highest
intraday level is 0.4 percent stronger at 1,588.5 per dollar.  “The shilling has depreciated today on increased demand
and the central bank has slowed its support for the local
currency,” Hakim Sheik, a trader with Commercial Bank of Africa
Tanzania Ltd., said by phone today from Dar es Salaam, the
commercial capital.  The Ugandan shilling appreciated for the first time in
seven days. The currency of the third-biggest economy in East
Africa appreciated 0.3 percent to 2,475 per dollar.  -- With assistance from David Malingha Doya in  Dar es Salaam .
