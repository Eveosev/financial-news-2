The U.S. has opened a civil rights
investigation into the shooting death of a black teenager killed
by a community watch member in Florida, according to a  Justice
Department  statement.  “The department will conduct a thorough and independent
review of all of the evidence and take appropriate action at the
conclusion of the investigation,” the Justice Department said
today in an e-mailed statement.  Trayvon Martin, 17, was shot and killed by a volunteer
community watch member while walking in a gated neighborhood
near Orlando last month, according to the Orlando Sentinel.
George Zimmerman, 28, said he acted in self-defense, according
to the Sentinel.  The Justice Department’s civil rights division, the  Federal
Bureau of Investigation  and the U.S. attorney’s office for the
Middle District of Florida are participating in the
investigation into the “facts and circumstances” of Martin’s
death, according to the department statement.  Students held rallies on the campus of  Florida  A&M
University in Tallahassee and outside the Seminole County
Criminal Justice Center, where prosecutors are reviewing the
case to determine if charges should be filed, the  Associated
Press  reported. The students demanded Zimmerman’s arrest by
local authorities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
