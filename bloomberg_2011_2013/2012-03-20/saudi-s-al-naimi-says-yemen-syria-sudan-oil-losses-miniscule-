Oil supply disruptions in Yemen,
Sudan and  Syria  are located in “miniscule” producers and total
no more than 500,000 barrels a day, Saudi Arabian Oil Minister
Ali al-Naimi said.  At the same time, members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries are boosting capacity, Al-Naimi told a
gathering of seven reporters today in Doha, Qatar.  Libya  will
probably restore output to about 1.7 million barrels a day
“very soon” and Iraq has commissioned an export facility to
ship 900,000 barrels a day, he said.  “The supply side is far more firm today, unlike 2008,”
al-Naimi said. “The supply side is coming from producers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
