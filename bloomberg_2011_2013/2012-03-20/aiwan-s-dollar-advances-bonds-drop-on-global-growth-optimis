Taiwan ’s dollar weakened for the
first time in three days as foreign funds cut holdings of the
island’s assets on concern slowing growth in China will hurt
demand for exports.  Government bonds  were little changed.  Global funds sold $93 million more Taiwanese shares than
they bought in the past two days, according to exchange data.
China cut on March 5 its target for annual economic expansion to

Eric Hsing, a fixed-income trader at First Securities Inc. in
Taipei. “The central bank will probably keep  interest rates 
unchanged.”  Taiwan’s dollar weakened 0.1 percent to NT$29.558 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings that
traders use to price options, was little changed at 4.5 percent.  Official data showed today that export orders rebounded
17.6 percent last month from a year earlier, following an 8.63

highest level for a benchmark 10-year note since Jan. 6,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Ministry of Finance
