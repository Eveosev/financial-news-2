Explosions rocked four cities
across  Iraq  today, including a bombing near the Foreign Ministry
in  Baghdad  where the annual Arab League summit is due to be held
next week.  A total of 27 people were killed and 161 wounded in the
explosions in the capital as well as in Kirkuk, Salaheddin,
Karbala, Hilla and Ramadi, according to Health Ministry and
police officials. The highest toll was in Karbala, where 13
people were killed and 58 others wounded, Health Ministry local
spokesman Jamal Mehdi said in a telephone interview.  Baghdad is due to host the Arab League annual summit on
March 29. Foreign ministers are scheduled to gather there on
March 28 and economy ministers a day earlier. The meeting was
postponed from last year after a wave of popular protests across
the region.  The Iraqi government, which is struggling to rebuild the
country’s economy and energy industry after years of conflict,
has promoted the Arab summit as a sign of the return of
stability. Iraq, which holds the world’s fifth-largest oil
reserves, has been engulfed by violence since the 2003 U.S.-led
invasion that ousted President  Saddam Hussein .  To contact the reporter on this story:
