CDC Corp. (CDCAQ) , a maker of business-
management software, won court approval to sell the majority
stake in a software unit to Vista Equity Partners for about $250
million.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Paul W. Bonapfel granted the company
permission to sell its 87 percent equity interest in CDC
Software Corp. at a hearing today in Atlanta, according to court
documents.  The sale to Vista allows CDC to pay all creditors in full
and provide a recovery to shareholders, according to court
papers. CDC estimates investors may get a payout of about $5.05
a share. The company canceled a March 16 auction after receiving
no competing offers.  CDC (CDCAQ)  rose 10 cents to $4.70 at 3:37 p.m. New York time. The
shares have surged more than 2700 percent this year, spurred by
the agreement with Vista.  Gregory D. Ellis, a lawyer for CDC, declined to comment on
the ruling. Stuart E. Casillas, a lawyer representing Vista, and
Vista officials werenâ€™t immediately available to comment on the
acquisition.  Vista, a San Francisco-based private-equity firm, has
completed 20 transactions during the past three years with a
total value of more than $6 billion, according to court papers.  CDC provides business-software applications and services,
information-technology consulting and IT staffing, according to
its  website . The company also develops online games in  China .  The case is In re CDC Corp., 11-79079,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Northern District of  Georgia  (Atlanta).  To contact the reporter on this story:
