Treasuries rose, pushing 10-year
note yields down from four-month highs and ending a nine-day
decline that was the longest run of losses since 2006, as yields
climbed to levels that lured investors.  The benchmark notes dropped earlier for a 10th consecutive
trading day in what would have been the longest run of declines
since at least 1985. The  Federal Reserve  bought $1.97 billion of
Treasuries today in a program to lower borrowing costs. Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said one lesson from the Great
Depression is to avoid moving quickly in reversing Fed policy.  “The market is taking a bit of a breather after testing
the 2.4 percent level yesterday,” said Larry Milstein, managing
director in New York of government and agency debt trading at
R.W. Pressprich & Co., a fixed-income broker and dealer for
institutional investors. “We are in a new range from 2.1
percent to 2.4 percent.”  Yields on 10-year notes fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.36 percent at 5:03 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. Earlier they slid to
2.33 percent  and rose  to 2.4 percent, the highest level since
Oct. 28. The 2 percent securities due in February 2022 gained
5/32, or $1.56 per $1,000 face amount, to 96 27/32. They traded
this year between 1.79 percent and 2.09 percent until March 13.  Ten-year Treasury notes yielded 11.9 percent on March 20,
1985, down from the record high of 15.8 percent reached in
September 1981, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ronald
Reagan  had been sworn in for a second term as president two
months earlier, while  Paul Volcker  served as Fed chairman.  Below 2011 High  While 10-year yields were up 27 basis points last week,
they’re still below last year’s high of 3.77 percent and their
average of 3.87 percent over the past decade.  The 14-day  relative strength index  for 10-year yields was
74.2 today, exceeding 70 for a fifth day. A reading above that
level indicates to some traders that a gain in the yields may be
hard to sustain.  “The market is trying to establish fair value for Treasury
debt,” said  Christopher Sullivan , who oversees $1.9 billion as
chief investment officer at United Nations Federal Credit Union
in  New York .  Valuation measures show government debt is trading near the
least expensive level since October. The term premium, a model
created by economists at the Fed, was negative 0.27 percent. It
dropped to negative 0.79 percent on Feb. 2, the most expensive
ever. A negative reading indicates investors are willing to
accept yields below what’s considered fair value.  ‘Fundamental Shift’  “There’s been a fundamental shift in the market,” said
 George Goncalves , head of interest rate strategy at Nomura
Holdings Inc., one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the
U.S. central bank. “The market looks broken. There’s really no
support other than the Fed.”  Thirty-year bond  yields declined three basis points to 3.45
percent after increasing yesterday to 3.49 percent, the highest
level since September.  Stocks pared losses. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 (SPX)  Index ended
the day down 0.3 percent after dropping as much as 0.9 percent.  Treasury investors in a weekly survey by JPMorgan Chase &
Co. increased bets the price of the securities will rise.  The percent of “net longs” rose to 10 in the week ended
yesterday, according to the survey. The decline in the level of
outright shorts, 8 percent, was the largest since Feb. 13, the
firm said in a statement.  Last week, investors bet for the first time since January
that the price of the securities would drop. The survey shifted
to a “net short” position for the first time since Jan. 3.  Volatility Rises  Volatility climbed to the highest level this year. Bank of
America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE  index , which measures price swings
based on options, increased to 93.3 basis points, the most since
Dec. 29.  Volume (ICPTVOL)  declined today, with about $284 billion of
Treasuries changing hands through ICAP Plc, the world’s largest
interdealer broker, as of 5:01 p.m. It rose yesterday to $303
billion. Volume reached $439 billion on March 14, the highest
since August. The average daily volume over the past year is
$268 billion.  The Treasury will announce on March 22 the amounts it will
auction in two-, five- and seven-year debt next week on three
consecutive days beginning March 27. The government will sell
$13 billion in 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities
on March 22.  The Fed raised its assessment of the economy last week
while reiterating it plans to keep the target lending rate at
virtually zero through at least late 2014.  Comfort Level  Central-bank policy makers need to be relatively
comfortable with where the economy is going before reversing
policy, Bernanke said today in  Washington . He spoke in the first
of four lectures on the history of the Fed that he’s delivering
at George Washington University.  The Fed bought Treasuries today maturing from February 2036
to February 2042 as part of its effort to replace $400 billion
of shorter-term securities in its holdings with longer-term
bonds through June. Traders dubbed the program Operation Twist
after a similar plan in the 1960s.  Treasuries rose earlier as BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s
largest mining company, said  China ’s steel production is
slowing, underpinning demand for the safest assets. China
increased gasoline and diesel prices for the second time in less
than six weeks amid speculation the move will damp growth.  Housing starts in the U.S. fell in February from a three-
year high. Builders  broke ground  on 698,000 homes at an annual
rate, in line with the median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey and down 1.1 percent from a January pace that was
stronger than previously reported, Commerce Department figures
showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
