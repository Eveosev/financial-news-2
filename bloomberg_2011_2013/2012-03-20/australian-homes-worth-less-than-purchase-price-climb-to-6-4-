The number of Australian homes
worth less than the price they were bought for climbed to 6.4
percent in the December quarter reflecting declining demand,
according to property researcher  RP Data .  Properties in Far North Queensland fared the worst, with
22.6 percent of homes with negative equity, Brisbane-based RP
Data said in an e-mailed report. Loddon Shire in Victoria state
had the fewest homes worth less than their purchase prices at
1.9 percent, followed by Canberra, the nation’s capital, at 2
percent, the report showed. In the previous three months, houses
with negative equity accounted for 4.9 percent.  “Since late 2010, the Australian housing market has been
quite weak,” RP Data said in the report. “More than 75 percent
of all homes currently worth less than their initial purchase
price have been owned for less than five years.”  Reserve Bank  of  Australia  Governor Glenn Stevens kept the
benchmark  interest rate  at 4.25 percent on March 6, saying that
while  home prices  have shown some signs of stabilizing, the
market remains soft.  Home prices in Australia’s eight capital cities fell 4.4
percent in the 12 months to February, RP Data said on March 1.
The number of loans to build or buy homes dropped 1.2 percent in
January, the first decline in 10 months, according to a March 13
government report.  About 42 percent of homes are worth more than twice what
their owners paid for them, down from 43 percent in September,
according to the RP Data report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
