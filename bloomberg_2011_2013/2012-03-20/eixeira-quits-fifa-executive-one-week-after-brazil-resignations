Ricardo Teixeira  resigned from the
executive committee of soccer’s governing body, one week after
quitting as head of the Brazilian federation and the group
organizing the 2014 World Cup.  Teixeira, 64, said he was  stepping down  from FIFA’s 24-
person executive, of which he’d been a member since 1994, for
personal reasons, the South American Football Confederation, or
CONMEBOL, said on its website yesterday. CONMEBOL didn’t give
further details for the “irrevocable” decision.  Teixeira, who has suffered bouts of ill health this year,
resigned last week as both president of  Brazil ’s soccer
federation and head of the organizing committee for the 2014
World Cup. He was replaced in both posts by his vice president
and former Sao Paulo governor Jose Maria Marin.  His resignation from the CBF ended a 23-year tenure marked
by an unmatched  World Cup  record for the national team during
that period and accusations of corruption off the field.  In 2001, Brazil’s Congress investigated Teixeira over
alleged irregularities. The British Broadcasting Corp. named him
as a beneficiary of bribes paid by FIFA’s bankrupt former
marketing partner ISL in a separate case. He has denied all the
allegations.  Brazil played in three World Cup finals during Teixeira’s
tenure, winning the 1994 and 2002 editions to lift its tally to
a record five victories at the four-yearly championship.  To contact the reporter on this story:
