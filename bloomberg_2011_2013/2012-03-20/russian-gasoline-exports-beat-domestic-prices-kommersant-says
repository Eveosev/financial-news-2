Gasoline exports from  Russia  became
more profitable than domestic sales last week even with the
government’s special duty on motor fuel exports to curb domestic
shortages,  Kommersant  said, citing data from Kortes.  Increased gasoline exports may lead the state to either
increase duties or let  prices  rise, Kommersant said, without
citing anyone. Last week two companies exported small volumes of
gasoline, Kommersant reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Deputy Prime Minister  Igor Sechin  may hold talks on
domestic gas prices tomorrow, after discussions he led March 12
on prolonging gasoline price caps until May, Kommersant said.
Sechin’s proposals for compensating oil refiners for the caps
have been rejected by government agencies, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
