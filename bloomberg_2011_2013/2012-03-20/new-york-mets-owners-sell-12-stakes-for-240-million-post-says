New York Mets owners  Fred Wilpon 
and Saul Katz sold 12 minority stakes for $240 million last
week, easing financial pressure on the  Major League Baseball 
franchise, the  New York Post  reported.  Wilpon and Katz used the sales to repay $65 million in
loans from Major League Baseball and Bank of America and at
least $100 million of the money-losing franchise’s $430 million
debt, according to the Post.  The Mets owners bought three of the 12 units and  Time
Warner Cable Inc. (TWC) , Comcast Corp. and billionaire hedge fund
manager  Steve Cohen  acquired at least one each, the Post said. A
phone Call to the office of Wilpon and Katz outside office hours
wasn’t answered.  To contact the reporters on this story:
