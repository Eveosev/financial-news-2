Siemens AG (SIE) ,  Europe ’s largest
engineering company, agreed to buy a subsea power-grid equipment
supplier from Expro Holdings for 470 million euros ($621
million) to expand its offering to the oil and gas industry.  The unit, which posted sales of 90 million euros last year,
makes cable connectors, sensors and measuring devices for use on
sea beds at depths down to 3,000 meters (9842 feet), Munich-
based Siemens said today in an e-mailed statement.  “Deep-sea applications are one of the fastest-growing
market segments within the oil and gas industry,” the company
said in the statement. “The market volume is expected to reach
2 billion euros by 2020.”  The acquisition is Chief Executive Officer  Peter Loescher ’s
second largest after the purchase of Dade Behring for $7 billion
in 2007. Siemens has pursued smaller acquisitions of less than 1
billion euros, opting to preserve its cash holdings that stood
at 12.5 billion euros at the end of its most recent financial
year. By contrast, power-grid builder ABB has spent about $7.6
billion in the past three years on acquisitions, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Siemens traded 1.3 percent lower at 78.46 euros as of 10:48
a.m. in Frankfurt.  Expro is owned by Arle Capital Partners. The Expro unit’s
equipment ensures a reliable power supply that can withstand the
pressures of deepsea oil and gas drilling, Siemens said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
