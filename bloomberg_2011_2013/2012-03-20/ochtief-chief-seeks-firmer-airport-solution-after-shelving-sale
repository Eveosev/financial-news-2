Hochtief AG (HOT) ,  Germany ’s largest
construction company, will put together a firmer plan to exit
its airport business after shelving a planned sale a second
time, Chief Executive Officer Frank Stieler said.  “We’ve now tried twice to sell our airports,” Stieler
said today at an event in Munich. “Before we make an
announcement for a third time, we’ll try and have a presentable
solution in place.”  Hochtief in January had said it still aims to sell the unit
this year, though conceded market conditions were making a sale
more difficult than expected. A buyer of the airports
concessions business would gain stakes in six airports serving
cities such as Hamburg, Sydney, Budapest and  Athens .  Hochtief in December 2009 shelved an attempt for an initial
public offering of its wider concessions unit, which included
the airports operations, citing a slump in global  capital
markets .  To contact the reporter on this story:
