AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)  said it won’t seek
regulatory approval of an experimental antidepressant licensed
from  Targacept Inc. (TRGT)  after the compound failed in its two
remaining late-stage studies.  AstraZeneca will take an impairment charge of $50 million,
the London-based drugmaker said today in a statement.
AstraZeneca and Targacept were testing the drug, known as
TC-5214, as an adjunct treatment for major depressive disorder.  The setback may further test AstraZeneca’s strategy of
avoiding large acquisitions since its 2007 purchase of MedImmune
Inc. for about $15.2 billion. AstraZeneca’s second-best-selling
drug, Seroquel for schizophrenia, loses U.S. patent protection
in March, while the patent on Nexium for ulcers, the third-
biggest seller, expires in 2014. Together the two medicines
generated more than $10 billion in sales last year.  AstraZeneca had licensed the depression treatment from
Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based Targacept in 2009 in a deal
valued at as much as $1.24 billion. Targacept shares fell 36
percent on Dec. 20 after the two drugmakers said TC-5214 had
failed in the second of four late-stage trials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
