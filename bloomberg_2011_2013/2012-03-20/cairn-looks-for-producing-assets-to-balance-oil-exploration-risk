Cairn Energy Plc (CNE) , the U.K. oil
explorer with the largest number of licenses in Greenland, will
look for investments in producing fields to balance the risk of
exploration plans.  Cairn, which doesn’t plan to drill any wells this year,
will focus exploration on Greenland, where it’s analyzing
seismic data from the Pitu block, and a seismic survey of two
blocks off Spain. Cairn also plans to bid in licensing rounds in
Lebanon and Cyprus.  “Exploration activity, however, needs to be funded from
within a balanced portfolio of assets capable of generating
sustainable  cash flow  from producing properties,” Chief
Executive Officer Simon Thomson said.  Thomson declined to say where Cairn may look to acquire
assets. The Edinburgh-based company retains a 22 percent holding
in  Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR)  after completing the sale of a 40 percent
stake to  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  for $5.4 billion. After returning
$3.5 billion to shareholders in February, Cairn holds a cash
balance of about $1.2 billion.  “The company highlighted that it is looking to generate
shareholders return through near-term exploration, development
and producing assets,” Nomura analysts said in a note today.
“It is not going to spend any more money drilling in Greenland
in 2012, which should assure the market on preservation of the
$1.2 billion cash pile.”  Cairn drilled eight wells off Greenland in 2010 and 2011
without making a commercial discovery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
