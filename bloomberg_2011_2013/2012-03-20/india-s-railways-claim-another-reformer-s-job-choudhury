India 's ruling coalition government, the  United Progressive Alliance , or UPA, advanced its fast-growing reputation for perverse populism and policy paralysis last week when it ratified the dismissal of its own railway minister, Dinesh Trivedi, shortly after he presented a fiscally prudent and forward-looking budget for India's railroad system. Trivedi's offense was to  propose a modest increase in passenger fares  (currently subsidized by the government and cross-subsidized by freight fares) for the first time in nine years -- a necessary step to ensure the health of a network that ferries about 30 million passengers daily over routes totaling about 65,000 kilometers (39,000 miles). For this crime he was promptly yanked out of his job by his party boss, the firebrand  Mamata Banerjee  of the Trinamul Congress, who attacked the decision as "anti-poor" and sought to replace Trivedi with the presumably more obedient Mukul Roy. Not only did the government  agree to Trivedi's ouster , citing "the compulsions of coalition politics," it refused to commit itself to the provisions of his budget, which were surely not a surprise as they were presented in Parliament by Trivedi. It is probable that some of the proposed fare increases will be "rolled back" -- a fair image for the direction taken by the present government itself. The entire episode reeked of intellectual bankruptcy, petulance and pusillanimity. When queried about the wisdom of her move, Banerjee proffered a rationalization that reveals much about the character of Indian democracy: that the very parties that work the democratic system have no commitment to democracy internally, and that almost every one has some grand paterfamilias, or  mater , who runs the show, coasting serenely on a sea of sycophancy. “It is my right to decide who will be the railway minister, Why Sonia [Gandhi, the chairperson of the UPA and the most powerful figure in Indian politics] decides who should be the prime minister of the country?” Banerjee asked. Meanwhile, Roy was  sworn in  as the new railway minister, becoming the third occupant of the post in this government in less than a year. The first was Banerjee herself, who then ceded the post to Trivedi when her party won a  historic election  in West Bengal last May to end 34 years of Communist rule in that state. In a stinging piece in the Indian Express called " The Trivedi Tutorial ," the newspaper's editor Shekhar Gupta called Trivedi "the first martyr" of the process of  economic reforms  that began in India in 1991, when the ruling Congress Party took a number of steps to liberalize the economy under the direction of the present prime minister, Manmohan Singh. Gupta correctly pointed out: And on the website of the news channel CNN-IBN, the longtime railways correspondent  Vivian Fernandes wrote  that Trivedi had surprised everyone with the audacity of his budget and his insistence that the railway system had to "bite the bullet" if it was to expand and modernize. He also supplied a summary of the shenanigans of various railway ministers before Trivedi, including Banerjee: In the Sunday Guardian,  Prayaag Akbar took a contrary view , suggesting that it was erroneous to criticize the railways for continuing to subsidize passengers -- or indeed Banerjee for opposing a hike in fares -- when subsidies were everywhere in the economy, including in the education of the middle class and the rich: Perhaps the point to make here, though, is that Trivedi's budget was by general consensus only mildly reformist. Yet it gave every indication of the minister having taken, unlike his more cynical predecessors, a genuine and detailed interest in the present and the future of the  Indian Railways , and his prepared speech is a  document of considerable elegance and insight  -- one that should have ensured for him a long and distinguished tenure and not an unceremonious dismissal. Very simply, the speech is a positive illustration of the art of politics: of providing a survey of a complex field, of outlining various choices made and the reasons for making them, of not always taking the path of least resistance, and of trying to balance the short-term view with the long-term one. As Trivedi argued: Among the other things we learned from the railway budget was that the corrosion of tracks from the human waste deposited on them from  train toilets  costs the Railways 350 crore ($70 million) every year, an amount that would be saved with a new model of "green toilets." Also, the Railways had just completed the building of an "11 km long tunnel through Pir Panjal Mountain Range, which would provide connectivity to the  Kashmir valley ," hitherto unlinked by the Indian rail system. There is plenty of reason to believe, as Trivedi claimed in the last paragraph of the speech, that in India "rail gadi ke chuk-chuk mein hi/ aam aadmi ki dhak-dhak hai" ("In the sound of the train/ can be heard the heartbeat of the common man"). It is a pity, though, that this  enormously diverse , complex and accessible system -- one in which Indians of all stripes and classes can be found travelling together, on journeys stretching from a few minutes to almost  three days  -- is being inhibited by a coterie of short-sighted and spineless elected representatives from scaling up to meet the demands and infrastructure requirements of a time in which ever more human beings are on the move.
