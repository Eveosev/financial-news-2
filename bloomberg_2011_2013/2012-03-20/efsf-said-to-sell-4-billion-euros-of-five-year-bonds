The European Financial Stability
Facility plans to sell 4 billion euros of five-year bonds that
may be priced at a yield in the low to mid-40 basis-point area
more than the benchmark swap rate, according to a banker
involved in the transaction.  Citigroup Inc., Nomura Holdings Inc. and  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  are
managing the sale, the banker said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
