Societe Generale (GLE)  recommended paying
one-year lira cross-currency at current levels, saying the trade
would be “a hedge against the risk of a shift in the policy
message” by the Turkish central bank, a sliding lira and
inflation risk.  “We are watchful of the short-term risks,” the bank’s
emerging-market strategist Guillaume Salomon said in a report
from  London . “We prefer expressing these short-term concerns
via rates than foreign exchange, as paying one-year cross-
currency generates a positive carry in contrast to a short lira
position.”  SocGen recommended entry at 8 percent with a target of 8.6
percent and a stop at 7.68 percent.  The swaps traded at 8.01 percent at 2:52 p.m. today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
