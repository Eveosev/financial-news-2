Schaeffler AG, the world’s second-
biggest maker of roller bearings, forecast slower sales growth
and lower profitability in 2012 as the European market weakens.  Earnings before interest and taxes in 2012 will represent
more than 13 percent of revenue, which will climb more than 5
percent, the Herzogenaurach, Germany-based company said in a
statement today. The 2011 Ebit margin was 15.8 percent, while
sales gained 13 percent to 10.7 billion euros ($14.2 billion).  “We are currently seeing demand in the European markets
weaken,” Chief Executive Officer Juergen Geissinger said in the
statement. “Globally, however, our business is continuing to
show a positive trend.”  Schaeffler, which is closely held and accumulated 12
billion euros of debt from purchasing a controlling stake in
car-parts maker  Continental AG (CON)  in 2008, became a joint-stock
corporation in October to improve access to outside funding. The
company had net financial debt of about 7.1 billion euros at the
end of 2011.  An 18 percent increase in Asian sales last year led revenue
increases, while the industrial division’s 15 percent growth
exceeded the 13 percent gain at the automotive unit. Growth last
year surpassed the company’s targets of more than 10 percent
sales growth and an operating margin of more than 13 percent.  Net income grew more than fourteen-fold in 2011 to 889
million euros from 63 million euros a year earlier. Operating
profit gained 12 percent to 1.7 billion euros, Schaeffler said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
