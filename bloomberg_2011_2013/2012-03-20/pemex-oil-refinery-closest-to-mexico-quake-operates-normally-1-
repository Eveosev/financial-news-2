Petroleos Mexicanos ’ Salina Cruz
oil refinery, the country’s largest, is operating normally after
a 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck in the southwestern state of
Oaxaca.  Operations are “under control” and the facilities at
Salina Cruz, which produces 330,000 barrels of oil a day, are
“stable,” refinery spokeswoman Fatima Campos said by telephone
today.  Mexican President Felipe Calderon, in a message posted on
his Twitter account, said no major damage had been detected in
the country so far, echoing reports based on a helicopter
flyover by Milenio TV.  Petroleos Mexicanos , known as Pemex, is the world’s third-
largest oil producer and the biggest in  Latin America . There
aren’t any reports yet of damage at other facilities, an
official for the Mexico City-based company, who can’t be named
because of corporate policy, said by e-mail today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
