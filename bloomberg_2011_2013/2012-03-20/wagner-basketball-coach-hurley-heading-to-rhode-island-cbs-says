Dan Hurley is leaving  Wagner
College  to coach the  University of Rhode Island  men’s basketball
team, according to  CBS Sports .  Hurley, 39, agreed on a six-year deal to become the Rams’
coach, CBS reported on its  website . He replaces Jim Baron, who
was fired earlier this month from the Kingston,  Rhode Island ,
school.  Athletics spokesmen at both Wagner and Rhode Island didn’t
immediately return e-mails seeking comment.  Dan Hurley is the son of  Basketball Hall of Fame  high
school coach Bob Hurley and brother of former Duke University
point guard Bobby Hurley, who was the National Collegiate
Athletic Association tournament’s Most Outstanding Player in
1992. Bobby, on Dan’s staff at Wagner, may follow him to Rhode
Island, CBS said.  Hurley’s team was 25-6 this season, his second at Wagner,
but didn’t receive an invitation to any postseason tournament.
The Seahawks beat the  University of Pittsburgh , then ranked No.
15 in the Associated Press poll on Dec. 23, and had four losses
to teams that made this year’s NCAA tournament --  Lehigh
University ,  the University of  Connecticut , and two to  Long
Island University, Brooklyn . Rhode Island was 7-24 this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
