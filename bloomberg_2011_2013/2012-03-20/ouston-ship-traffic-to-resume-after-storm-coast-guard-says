Maritime pilots who guide tankers
and other deep-draft ships through the  Houston Ship Channel  to
the largest U.S. petroleum port will resume operations by 1:30
p.m. local time today.  Houston Pilots halted boardings yesterday at 10:40 p.m.
local time because of rough seas caused by thunderstorms that
passed through the area, Brian Wear, a Coast Guard watch
supervisor in Houston, said in a telephone interview today.  The suspension stalled 59 ships, including 28 bound for
Houston and 31 waiting to leave the port, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
