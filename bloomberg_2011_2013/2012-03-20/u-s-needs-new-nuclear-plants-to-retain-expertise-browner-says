Carol Browner , who resigned as the
White House’s top adviser on climate change last year, said the
U.S. needs to build new nuclear power plants to retain the
technical knowledge.  “I’m concerned that if we don’t build new nuclear plants
we’ll lose the engineers, scientists and construction workers
with the know-how,” Browner said today in an interview at the
Bloomberg New Energy Finance Summit in New York.  “We tried to jumpstart the process and get more people
interested in nuclear to improve the technology and reduce
costs,” she said.  Browner is now senior counselor at Albright
Stonebridge Group.  Southern Co. (SO) , based in Atlanta, received approval in
February to build two new reactors at its Vogtle plant. The $14
billion project is the first to receive a license to build from
the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission since before the partial
meltdown at the Three Mile Island facility in 1979.  To contact the reporter on this story:
