China Gas Holdings Ltd. (384)  said it
objects “in the strongest terms” to the delays by  ENN Energy
Holdings Ltd. (2688)  and  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028)  in completing
their joint takeover of the mainland city-gas supplier.  The delays are “extremely frustrating for China Gas, for
our staff and for our shareholders,” President Eric Leung said
in an e-mailed statement today.  Sinopec, as China Petroleum is known, and ENN offered to
acquire China Gas for HK$3.50 (45 cents) a share in December,
which the city-gas supplier rejected. The bidders yesterday
extended the deadline for completing negotiations to May 15 from
March 31, and ENN said it would dispatch a circular on the bid
to its shareholders by April 30.  “This new timetable allows ENN and Sinopec five months to
formalize an offer, and yet they still retain the right to
extend this even further,” Leung said. “This is totally
unreasonable. We object in the strongest terms to this
extension.”  An external spokesman for the two bidders said in an e-
mailed statement today that China Gas’s response is “surprising
as we have been completely transparent that we are going through
a standard regulatory approval process.”  “In parallel, we continue to seek principal to principal
discussions on the proposed acquisition, which we believe will
benefit the stakeholders of all parties involved,” the
spokesman said.  China Gas has gained 36 percent in  Hong Kong  trading since
the takeover was proposed in December. The shares rose 1.6
percent to close at HK$3.82 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
