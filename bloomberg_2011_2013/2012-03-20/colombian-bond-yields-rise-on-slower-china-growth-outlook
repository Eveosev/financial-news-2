Colombia ’s peso bonds fell, pushing
yields on benchmark securities to the highest level in three
weeks, as signs of slower growth in  China  led to reduced demand
for higher-yielding assets.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent peso-denominated bond
due July 2024 rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point,
to 7.36 percent, according to the central bank. Yields are at
the highest since Feb. 24. The price fell 0.319 centavo to
120.871 centavos per peso.  Signs of a slowdown in China boosted concern about the
world economy, leading investors to decrease holdings of higher-
yielding, emerging-market assets, said William Florez, an
analyst at  Helm Bank SA (PFBHELMB) ’s brokerage unit in Bogota.  China’s steel production is slowing, according to Ian Ashby, president of  iron ore  at  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
third-largest exporter. Automobile sales may miss industry
forecasts this year as economic growth slows, an official from
the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said.  Yields also rose on forecast for economic growth ahead of
the government’s report this week, Florez said in a telephone
interview. “With expectations for higher growth, the market
starts anticipating rate increases going forward, which impacts
the longer-dated maturities,” he said.  The national statistics agency will report 2011 annual
growth of 5.9 percent on March 22, according to the median
forecast of 23 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Banco de la
Republica increased the overnight lending rate 25 basis points
to 5.25 percent on Feb. 24, the ninth increase since January
2011. Policy makers next meet on March 23.  The peso rose 0.1 percent to 1,757.95 per  U.S. dollar . It
has jumped 10 percent this year, the third-biggest advance among
all currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Colombian markets were
closed yesterday for a holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
