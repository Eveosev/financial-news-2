European (SXXP)  stocks dropped the most in
two weeks as an official at  China ’s association of carmakers
said auto sales will miss its forecast in 2012.  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  and Daimler AG fell more than 4
percent.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  slumped 4.1 percent, leading a gauge
of mining companies lower.  Metro AG (MEO)  advanced after  Germany ’s
largest retailer posted fourth-quarter earnings that matched
analysts’ estimates.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index retreated 1.1 percent to 268.96
at the close for the benchmark measure’s biggest drop since
March 6. The gauge has still  gained 10 percent this year  as the
 European (SXXP)  Central Bank disbursed 1 trillion euros ($1.3 trillion)
to the region’s lenders.  “Last week was a major move and there’s no surprise that
we’ve seen a bit of a rest this week,”  David Miller , a partner
at Cheviot Asset Management in  London  said in a Bloomberg
Television interview with Caroline Hyde. “There’s been a
growing realization that in fact the economic numbers
particularly out of the States have been better than expected
and consistently good and in Europe we’ve had the absence of bad
news.”  The benchmark Stoxx 600 slipped 0.1 percent yesterday,
paring the previous week’s 2.6 percent rally, its biggest weekly
gain since early February.  National benchmark indexes declined in 15 of the 18
western-European markets. Germany’s DAX Index slid 1.4 percent
and  France ’s CAC 40 Index retreated 1.3 percent. The U.K.’s FTSE
100 Index sank 1.2 percent.  VStoxx Index Gains  The  VStoxx Index (V2X) , which measures the cost of option prices
on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, jumped 8.5 percent to 19.91 today.
The European volatility gauge has still  plunged 63 percent  since
its almost 32-month high on Sept. 12 and is 24 percent below its
 historical average  before today of 26.37, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg going back to January 1999.  The volume of shares changing hands on the Euro Stoxx 50
Index was 13 percent less than the average over the past 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A U.S. Commerce Department report showed that housebuilding
in the world’s largest economy fell in February.  Housing starts 
dropped to a 698,000 annual rate last month from a revised
706,000 pace in January. That fell short of the  median estimate
of 80 economists  surveyed by Bloomberg News. Building permits, a
proxy for future construction, climbed  to the highest level
since October 2008.  China’s Car Sales  Vehicle sales in the world’s second-largest economy will
probably miss the  China Association of Automobile Manufacturers ’
forecast for 2012, according to an official at the state-backed
body.  Total vehicle deliveries -- forecast to grow 8 percent this
year -- may fail to increase by even 5 percent because of the
“difficult” economy, Gu Xianghua, one of two deputies to the
secretary general at the CAAM, said at a conference in Qingdao
today, giving his personal opinion.  BMW, the  world’s largest maker of luxury vehicles , sank 5
percent to 68.22 euros.  Daimler AG (DAI) , whose Mercedes-Benz division
is  third-biggest  after BMW and Audi, dropped 4.4 percent to
45.05 euros.  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , which owns Audi, slid 4.4 percent to
133.05 euros. Porsche SE decreased 3.9 percent to 44.71 euros.
 Continental AG (CON) , Europe’s second-largest tiremaker, plunged 4.6
percent to 68.52 euros.  Renault Shares Retreat  Renault SA (RNO)  slid 3.4 percent to 40.16 euros. The French
carmaker and its Japanese affiliate Nissan Motor Co. will
probably complete a deal to acquire control of OAO AvtoVAZ
“soon,” said Igor Komarov, president of  Russia ’s biggest
carmaker.  The shareholders have reached an agreement, though the deal
is “complex and multifaceted,” Komarov said at a conference in
Moscow, declining to elaborate or clarify what he meant by
“soon.’  BHP Billiton , the world’s biggest mining company, slid 4.1
percent to 1,965 pence as a gauge of mining shares fell. Rio
Tinto Group, the  world’s third-largest mining company , dropped
4.2 percent to 3,464.5 pence.  BHP Billiton said China’s steel production has slowed as
the world’s fastest-growing major economy switches its focus
toward consumers and away from large building projects.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  dropped 1.9 percent to
28.63 pence. Britain’s biggest state-owned lender will shut some
operations in  South Korea ,  Indonesia  and  Singapore  after failing
to find a buyer for its businesses in those countries.  HSBC, Deutsche Bank  Banking shares as a group declined 1.7 percent as HSBC
Holding Plc,  Europe’s biggest bank , slid 2.2 percent to 565.3
pence.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Germany’s largest lender , fell 1.8
percent to 38.80 euros.  Lafarge SA (LG) , the world’s largest cement maker, sank 3.5
percent to 35.53 euros, leading construction stocks lower.  Akzo Nobel NV (AKZA) , the world’s biggest paintmaker, slid 1.9
percent to 44.57 euros. The stock was cut to underperform from
neutral at Bank of America Corp., meaning that shares will
perform worse than benchmark indexes.  Metro (MEO)  gained 0.9 percent to 31.16 euros after posting
earnings before interest, taxes and special items that declined
to 1.31 billion euros from 1.5 billion euros in the year-earlier
period. That matched the  average estimate  of 14 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Telekom Austria AG (TKA)  led telecommunications shares higher,
gaining 2.3 percent to 8.78 euros.  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  rose 2.1
percent to 170.8 pence. Telecom shares posted the best
performance of the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporter on this story:
