France Telecom SA (FTE) ,  France ’s largest
phone company, will roll out faster wireless networks by 2015
after the European Union decided to make more frequencies
available.  Networks based on the so-called long-term evolution
standard will be available in all its European markets, the
company said in a statement today. The move will support the
European Commission’s plan to boost the region’s digital
business, the company said.  France Telecom  Chief Executive Officer Stephane Richard is
meeting Neelie Kroes, the EU commissioner for digital affairs,
today to set out the program, Paris-based France Telecom said.
The company today unveiled 10 “digital commitments,” including
targets to sell more handsets that allow contactless payments;
to bolster cloud-computing services; and to provide hospitals
and consumers with electronic  health services .  To contact the reporter on this story:
