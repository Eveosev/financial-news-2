Philippine bonds declined on
speculation the central bank will halt interest-rate cuts as the
risk of faster inflation increases. The peso fell.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas may pause after this year’s two
reductions in borrowing costs as higher  oil prices  threaten to
spur inflation, Governor Amando Tetangco said March 10. The next
policy meeting is on April 19. The Trade Union Congress of the
Philippines is seeking higher wages in the capital, according to
Labor Secretary Rosalinda Baldoz.  “There’s a probability that the rate-cutting cycle will be
paused,” said Rafael Algarra, executive vice president of
financial markets at Security Bank Corp. in  Manila . “This has
pushed yields higher.”  The yield on the 7.375 percent debt due March 2021 rose
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 5.30 percent as
of 5 p.m. in Manila, according to Tradition Financial Services.
The peso weakened 0.4 percent to 43.068 per dollar, according to
Tullett Prebon Plc. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, fell to 6.1 percent
from 6.3 percent.  Consumer prices  in the  Philippines , which imports most of
its energy needs, rose 2.7 percent from a year earlier in
February, the smallest increase since September 2009. The
central bank has lowered its  benchmark rate  by half a percentage
point this year to 4 percent. The government approved a 0.50
peso ($0.01) increase in minimum fares in jeepneys, a common
form of public transport, Transportation Secretary Mar Roxas
said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
