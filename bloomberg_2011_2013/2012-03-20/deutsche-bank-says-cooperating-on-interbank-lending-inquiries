Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Germany ’s biggest
lender, said for the first time U.S. and European regulators
have asked it for information related to their probes into the
suspected manipulation of interbank lending rates.  The U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the European Commission are among watchdogs to subpoena the
lender or request information, the Frankfurt-based bank said in
its  annual report  today. Their requests relate to periods
between 2005 and 2011, Deutsche Bank said, adding that it’s
cooperating with the enquiries.  Regulators from Canada to  Japan  are probing whether banks
lied to hide their true cost of borrowing and traders colluded
to rig the London interbank offered rate. The rate is the
benchmark for $360 trillion of securities and is the basis for
 interest rates  on securities from mortgages to derivatives.  Deutsche Bank said a number of civil actions, including
putative class actions, have been filed in federal courts in the
U.S. in relation to the alleged manipulation of U.S. dollar
Libor and derivatives linked to the rate, the bank said. The
civil actions have been consolidated for pre-trial purposes in
the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of  New York 
and the litigations are “in their early stages,” it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
