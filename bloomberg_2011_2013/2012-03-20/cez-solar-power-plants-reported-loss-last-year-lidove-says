CEZ AS (CEZ) , the  Czech Republic ’s
largest power producer, reported a loss in most of its solar
power plants because operations started late in the fiscal year
and the company had to pay a 26 percent solar tax, Lidove Noviny
said, citing spokesman Ladislav Kriz.  CEZ’s two largest solar plants reported a combined loss of
96 million koruna ($5.2 million), the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
