The supply of crude oil cargoes for
the largest tankers rose 32 percent so far this year as  Saudi
Arabia  boosted exports to compensate for the possibility of
fewer Iranian cargoes, Arctic Securities ASA said.  Very large crude carriers hauled 97 million metric tons of
oil in the first 11 weeks of the year, up from 73.7 million tons
during the same period of 2011, Oslo-based analyst Erik Nikolai Stavseth said by phone today, referring to about 65 percent of
single-voyage, or spot, charters. Shipments strengthened as
Saudi Arabia boosted production before an embargo on Iranian oil
takes effect in July, he said.  The U.S., the world’s biggest oil consumer, imported an
average of 1.5 million barrels a day from Saudi Arabia this
year, on course for the highest quarterly average since
September 2008, according to preliminary data from the Energy
Department.  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) , also known as
Sinopec, booked 14 VLCCs to load cargoes in the Persian Gulf
last week, according to investment bank Dahlman Rose & Co.  “This is Iran playing into the market,” Stavseth said.
“The 2012 volume is 4 percent lower than the volume shipped in
the same period in 2007, which was a peak year in the world
economy, which tells me that demand is strong.”  The number of crude cargoes hauled to  Asia  on VLCCs from
the  Middle East  jumped 34 percent from the prior year to 229 in
the period, Stavseth said. Shipments of West African oil to Asia
rose by the same amount, and deliveries to the region from the
U.S. increased 19 percent to 37, he said.  Rates for the vessels on the benchmark Saudi Arabia-to-
Japan route advanced 32 percent to 65.66 industry standard
Worldscale points since the start of this year, according to the
 Baltic Exchange  in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
