BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA is studying the
securitization of trade-finance loans to help  France ’s biggest
bank cope with higher commodity prices, said Jacques-Olivier
Thomann, Geneva-based head of structured finance.  “We as a bank are studying several solutions in that
respect,” Thomann said today at the  Geneva Trading and Shipping
Association  conference. “It’s going to be a new asset class.”  BNP is seeking funds from investors to help it meet demand
for loans from traders buying and selling energy, metals and
grains. The Paris-based bank has already discussed the idea with
rating companies and has assigned working groups to design
securitized loans for a new market that may be worth “a few
billion dollars,” Thomann, president of the GTSA, said on the
sidelines of the conference.  “Prices are moving up and our balance sheet cannot move up
the same way that commodities are moving,” Thomann said. New
securitized products may be developed this year, he said.  Investing in commodity trade finance loans is a good
proposition because borrowers rarely default, said Pierre
Lorinet, chief financial officer of Trafigura Beheer BV, the
world’s third-largest independent oil trading company.  “The next stage is to explain to participants other than
banks what is the value of this asset class,” Lorinet said.  The CFO doesn’t advocate involving rating companies in new
securitization projects.“Their way of analyzing this type of
asset will make it over-onerous.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
