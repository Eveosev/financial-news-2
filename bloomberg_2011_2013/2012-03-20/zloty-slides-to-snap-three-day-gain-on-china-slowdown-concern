The Polish zloty weakened following
a three-day advance after  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  said  China ’s steel
production is slowing.  The zloty retreated 0.7 percent to 4.1366 per euro as of
11:54 a.m. in Warsaw for the second-steepest decline among 25
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  China, the world’s biggest energy consumer and steelmaker,
is raising fuel prices for the second time in less than six
weeks. The nation’s vehicle sales may miss industry forecasts
this year as economic growth slows, an official from the China
Association of Automobile Manufacturers said.  The reports follow data from the Polish statistics office
yesterday that showed industrial output grew 4.6 percent in
February, missing the 8.8 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of 24 economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
