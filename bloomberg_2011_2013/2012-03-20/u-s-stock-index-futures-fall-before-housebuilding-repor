U.S. stocks declined, snapping a
three-day advance for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, as
commodities fell on concern about a Chinese economic slowdown.  Industrial and  commodity  shares slumped as  China  raised
fuel prices by the most in two years and BHP Billiton Ltd. said
the nation’s steel production is slowing. Caterpillar Inc. and
 Alcoa Inc. (AA)  dropped more than 1.5 percent.  Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE) 
sank 3.9 percent as its profit forecast missed some estimates.
 Bank of America Corp.  jumped 2.9 percent.  Tiffany & Co. (TIF)  surged
6.7 percent after forecasting profit that beat projections.  The S&P 500 retreated 0.3 percent to 1,405.52 at 4 p.m. New
York time, after the benchmark measure yesterday advanced to the
highest level since  May 2008. (SPX)  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
declined 68.94 points, or 0.5 percent, to 13,170.19 today. The
Russell 2000 Index of small companies slumped 1 percent to
829.24. About  6.2 billion  shares changed hands on U.S.
exchanges, or 6.5 percent below the three-month average.  “A Chinese slowdown is inevitable,” said  Peter Jankovskis , who helps manage about $2.9 billion at Oakbrook
Investments in Lisle,  Illinois . “It’s possible that will take
some of the heat out of commodities. Yet China is not the only
growth story out there. China will continue to be an important
player, but the  U.S. economy  seems to have found its legs.”  Equities fell as China is raising fuel prices for the
second time in less than six weeks. The nation’s vehicle sales
may miss industry forecasts this year as economic growth slows,
an official from the China Association of Automobile
Manufacturers said.  BHP Billiton (RIO) , the world’s biggest mining
company, said China’s steel production is slowing. In the U.S.,
housing starts hovered in February near a three-year high.  $3.6 Trillion  The S&P 500 has rallied 12 percent this year amid better
than estimated economic and corporate data. More than $3.6
trillion was restored to U.S. equity values since last year’s
low for the benchmark gauge in October. The rally drove the
index to about  14.6 times  reported earnings yesterday, the
highest valuation level since July.  Companies most dependent on economic growth had the biggest
declines in the S&P 500. The Dow Jones Transportation Average
retreated 1.3 percent. A gauge of  homebuilders  in S&P indexes
dropped 1 percent as 10 of its 11 stocks fell.  Measures of industrial and commodity shares in the S&P 500
dropped more than 0.5 percent.  Caterpillar (CAT) , the world’s biggest
maker of construction and mining-equipment, slumped 2.6 percent
to $110.76. Alcoa Inc., the largest U.S. aluminum producer, slid
1.5 percent to $10.44.  Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU) , the biggest U.S.
coal producer, declined 5.4 percent to $31.64.  Adobe, Disney  Adobe sank 3.9 percent to $33.16. Excluding some costs,
profit will be 57 cents to 61 cents a share in the second
quarter, Adobe said. The midpoint of that range -- 59 cents --
missed the 60 cents predicted by  analysts , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  dropped 0.5 percent to $43.24. The world’s
largest entertainment company said the box-office disappointment
“John Carter” will post a loss of about $200 million, possibly
the biggest ever for a single film.  A rally in financial companies helped the S&P 500 trim a
decline of as much as 0.9 percent. The  KBW Bank Index (BKX)  added 0.4
percent. Bank of America rallied 2.9 percent, the most in the
Dow, to $9.81.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  gained 1.7 percent to $20.41.  Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF)  climbed 2.3 percent to $19.49. The
investment bank that surged by almost half during the fiscal
first quarter reported a  profit  decline that was smaller than
analysts estimated as net revenue climbed to a record.  Tiffany Surges  Tiffany surged 6.7 percent to $73.27. The company is
benefiting from stock-market gains that have prompted luxury
consumers to resume jewelry purchases, a turnabout from January,
when the retailer said weak spending from U.S. customers had
slowed holiday sales.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  added 0.8 percent to a record $605.96. The
Cupertino, California-based technology provider yesterday
disclosed plans to pay a dividend and buy back $10 billion of
stock.  Barton Biggs , the hedge-fund manager who increased bets on
equities before the  S&P 500  rallied this year, is getting more
bullish.  “I’ve been gradually increasing and I’m up to 90 percent
now,” said Biggs, referring to the proportion of his fund that
benefits from higher share prices. He spoke in a radio interview
today on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene . “There is
an awful lot of money that is out of stocks and in very low-
yielding fixed-income instruments. I think the odds are that
money is going to migrate back.”  Net Long  Biggs, the founder of the Traxis Partners LP, said last
month that his net-long position, a gauge of bullish versus
bearish investments, in stocks is about 75 percent, up from 65
percent in January.  Treasuries rebounded today following the longest drop since
2006, with yields on 10-year notes falling to 2.36 percent. U.S.
stocks posted the best returns when 10-year Treasury yields rose
to close to 4 percent, according to a study by S&P that tracked
market performance since 1953.  The S&P 500 advanced 1.7 percent a month on average during
periods when 10-year yields climbed to a range of 3 percent to 4
percent, according to data compiled by New York-based S&P.
That’s the best performance among six categories of rising
yields studied by the firm. Stocks began to fall when yields
exceeded 6 percent, the study found.  While rising yields tend to boost borrowing costs for
companies and act as “a depressant in intrinsic value
calculations,” they can also suggest a strengthening economy
and prompt investors to switch to equities, according to  Sam Stovall , S&P’s chief equity strategist.  “The ‘sweet spot’ for equity prices appears to be a rising
rate environment between 3 percent and 4 percent, as a growing
economy reduces unemployment while increasing corporate
earnings, yet does not trigger growth-slowing efforts by the
central bank,” Stovall wrote in a report yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
