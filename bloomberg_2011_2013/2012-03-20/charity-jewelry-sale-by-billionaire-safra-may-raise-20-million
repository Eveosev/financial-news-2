The Brazilian-born billionaire  Lily Safra  is selling a collection of jewels at an auction in
 Switzerland  that’s set to raise more than $20 million for
charity.  Safra will offer 70 lots of her jewelry, dating from the
1970s to the present day, in a sale conducted by  Christie’s
International (CHRS)  at the Four Seasons Hotel des Bergues, Geneva, on
May 14. The event will include 18 pieces by JAR, the largest
private collection of items by this exclusive Parisian maker
ever offered at auction, the London-based company said in an e-
mailed statement.  Proceeds from the auction will be donated to 20 different
charitable institutions, said Christie’s. The Elton John AIDS
Foundation (Worldwide), Henry Street Settlement,  New York  and Le
Ballet de l’Opera National de Paris will be among the
beneficiaries.  A ruby and diamond Camellia flower brooch by JAR, specially
created for Safra in 2003, is estimated at $1.2 million to $1.5 
million.   Safra is the widow of the Lebanese banker Edmond J. Safra,
who died in a fire in his Monaco apartment in 1999. She has a
net worth of $1.2 billion, according to Forbes’s March 2012
listing of the world’s wealthiest individuals, and has headed
the philanthropic foundation bearing her late husband’s name
since 2000.  Giacometti, Richter  As well as being a philanthropist, London-based Safra is
also a prominent art collector. She paid a record 65 million
pounds (then $103.4 million) for  Alberto Giacometti ’s 1961
bronze sculpture “Walking Man I” at  Sotheby’s (BID) , London, in
February 2010, dealers said. She donated  Gerhard Richter ’s
painting “Abstraktes Bild 849-3 (1997)” to the Israel Museum,
the Jerusalem-based institution said in January. The Richter had
been bought for $20.8 million at a Sotheby’s auction in New York
in November 2011.  The following day (May 15), Sotheby’s Geneva will be 
offering for sale the Beau Sancy diamond. Weighing 34.98 carats, 
the modified pear double rose-cut stone was worn by Marie de 
Medici in her crown at her coronation as Queen Consort of Henri 
IV of  France  in 1610. It is currently owned by the Royal House
of Prussia, who acquired the diamond in the 18th century. 
Sotheby's has valued the gem at $2 million to $4 million.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
