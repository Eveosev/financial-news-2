Malaysia ’s ringgit fell toward a
two-month low on speculation investors will favor dollar assets
on signs the U.S. economic recovery is gathering pace.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific  Index (MXAP)  of stocks dropped, halting a
five-day advance, after a report showed confidence among U.S.
homebuilders held in March at the highest level since June 2007.
Positive U.S. economic data will boost demand for the greenback
and eventually feed through to Asian exports, said Saktiandi
Supaat of Singapore-based Malayan Banking Bhd. Government
figures tomorrow may show consumer-price gains in Malaysia
slowed for a fourth month in February.  “Some of the flows are going back to the U.S.,” said
Supaat, head of foreign-exchange research. “There’ll be a
second stage pass-through effect into Asian currencies as the
impact on trade will take time to filter through.”  The ringgit declined 0.7 percent to 3.0745 per dollar as of
4:40 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 3.0783 earlier, the weakest level since
Jan. 26. One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-
rate swings used to price options, fell 10 basis points, or 0.10
percentage point, to 7.80 percent.  Consumer prices rose 2.4 percent in February from a year
earlier, the least since January 2011, according to the median
 forecast  of 21 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The
National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo index of U.S.
builder confidence held at 28 this month.  Five-year Malaysian  government bonds  were little changed.
The yield on the 4.262 percent notes due September 2016 was 3.29
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
