New York Life Insurance Co., the
biggest U.S. life insurer owned by policyholders, plans to
eliminate about 200 jobs nationwide as Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Ted Mathas reshapes management.  “With any re-org you try to leverage efficiencies and
there will be some adjustments to staffing needs,” William Werfelman, a spokesman for the New York-based insurer, said
today in an e-mailed statement. “The number of affected
positions is very small relative to our base of more than 9,000
positions in the  United States  today.”  Mathas, 44, named John Kim to run the newly created
investments group in January, giving him oversight of the
company’s retail mutual funds and annuities, and institutional
asset management and retirement plan services. Chris Blunt was
selected to head the company’s insurance group, which manages
U.S. life and long-term care products.  Life insurers, which buy bonds to back obligations to
policyholders, have been under pressure as yields fell to near
record lows. MetLife Inc., the biggest U.S. life insurer,
reported a  4.74 percent  net investment income yield on its $494
billion portfolio in the fourth quarter, down from 5.21 percent
a year earlier. New York Life hasn’t reported results for 2011.  The positions will be eliminated across business lines,
Werfelman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
