Israel ’s shorter-term government
bonds fell, pushing yields to the highest level in a week, on
bets the central bank may start to raise  interest rates  later
this year amid signs of improving global growth.  The yield on the 3.5 percent notes due September 2013
climbed one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.72
percent at 12:13 p.m. in Tel Aviv, matching the level on March
14. Shorter-maturity notes are typically more sensitive to rate
fluctuations.  One-year interest-rate swaps , an indicator of
investor expectations for rates over the period, increased two
basis points to 2.59 percent.  The  Bank of Israel , led by Governor Stanley Fischer, held
the benchmark  rate  at 2.5 percent at the end of February, after
cutting it three times since September, citing signs of
improvement in the  U.S. economy . The  Federal Reserve  last week
raised its assessment of the world’s largest economy. The U.S.
is one the Middle East nation’s largest export markets.  “Yields are rising as the market is pricing in that the
central bank may start to increase borrowing costs as early as
the end of the year amid a global recovery,” said Amir Haik,
chief economist at Union Bank of Israel Ltd., in Tel Aviv. “The
U.S. economy is already showings signs of improvement, so the
timing of a rate increase will depend on developments in
 Europe .”  Israeli consumer prices are expected to increase by 2.6
percent in the next 12 months, compared with last month’s 2.4
percent, according to a survey of economists released by the
central bank today. The government’s target is 1 percent to 3
percent.  The yield on the 5.5 percent bonds due January 2022 dropped
one basis point to 4.77 percent. The rate has increased 11 basis
points this month.  The  Tel-Bond 40 (TEL-B40)  index of corporate bonds dropped less than
0.1 percent to 265.18. The shekel weakened 0.2 percent to 3.7532
a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
