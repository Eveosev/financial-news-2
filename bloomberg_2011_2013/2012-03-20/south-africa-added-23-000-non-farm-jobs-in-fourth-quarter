South Africa , which has the highest
unemployment rate of 61 countries tracked by Bloomberg, added
23,000  non-farm jobs  in the fourth quarter.  Employment in the formal, non-agricultural industries rose
0.3 percent to 8.4 million from the previous quarter, Pretoria-
based Statistics South Africa said on its website today. The
data is based on a survey of companies registered to pay taxes.  President  Jacob Zuma  has pledged to create 5 million new
jobs by 2020 in order to cut the jobless rate to 14 percent from
23.9 percent currently. Africa’s largest economy isn’t growing
fast enough to make a dent in unemployment as a possible
recession in Europe curbs demand from a region that buys about a
third of South African manufactured goods.  The  Reserve Bank  has kept the benchmark  interest rate  at
5.5 percent, the lowest level in more than 30 years, to support
the economy’s recovery. Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  on Feb.
22 cut the government’s forecast for growth this year to 2.7
percent from a previous estimate of 3.4 percent.  The statistics office compiles the  jobless rate  from the
Quarterly Labor Force report that surveys the formal and
informal industries, including agriculture. That report
published on Feb. 7 showed the number of employed workers rose
by 179,000 to 13.5 million in the fourth quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
