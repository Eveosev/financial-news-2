OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel (NILSY)  fell to a
three-week low in U.S. trading as prices for the metal slumped
on concern a slowdown in China will stem demand.  American depositary receipts of Norilsk, the world’s
largest producer of nickel and palladium, slipped 5.8 percent to
$18.60 in New York, the lowest level since Feb. 23. The stock
was the biggest decliner on the  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN) 
of Russian companies listed in the U.S.  Nickel was unchanged at $19,050 a metric ton on the London
Metal Exchange as investors speculated rising fuel prices in
China, the world’s biggest consumer of industrial metals, may
cut manufacturing. Vehicle sales may miss an industry forecast
this year as economic growth slows, Gu Xianghua, deputy
secretary general of the  China  Association of Automobile
Manufacturers said today.  “China’s slowdown is a negative sign,” Oleg Petropavlovskiy, a metals and mining analyst at Moscow’s Broker
Credit Service, said by phone today. “Nickel prices depend on
the Chinese demand, if the demand in China falls, the metals
prices will be under pressure.”  Norilsk got 22 percent of revenue from Asian sales in 2010,
up from 17 percent in 2006,  data  compiled by Bloomberg show.  Shares of  Norilsk (GMKN)  lost 3.9 percent to 5,523 rubles, or the
equivalent of $188.69, on Moscow’s Micex Index today. The ADRs
traded at a 1.4 percent  discount  to the Moscow shares, the
widest since March 7, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
