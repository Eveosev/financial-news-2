lower-quality coal from 2014, according to Edi Prasodjo, the
coal business director at the Energy and Mineral Resources
Ministry. The government hasn’t set a target for when the ban
will be applied or which type of coal it will affect because
it’s still seeking feedback from miners, Prasodjo said.  PT Kalbe Farma (KLBF)  , the pharmaceutical company fell
0.7 percent to 3,400 rupiah. Kalbe is in talks with five to
eight firms in the region for acquisitions as the cash-rich

Vidjongtius’s office wasn’t answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
