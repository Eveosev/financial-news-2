Assured Guaranty Ltd. (AGO)  insurance
units’ financial strength ratings were placed on review for
ratings cuts by Moody’s Investors Service.  Moody’s is reviewing the Aa3 rankings of Assured Guaranty
Municipal Corp., Assured Guaranty Corp. and their affiliated
insurance operating companies, the New York-based ratings
company said today in a statement.  Standard & Poor’s  lowered
Assured’s rating two steps in November.  Moody’s cited lower origination volume and reduced demand
for the Hamilton, Bermuda-based bond insurer’s business,
economic stress in the U.S. and Europe related to mortgage and
municipal finance and pressure on operating margins with
interest rates at about record lows.  “Today’s rating action reflects Moody’s opinion that
Assured Guaranty’s business and financial profiles may have
meaningfully deteriorated due to the firm’s narrower business
opportunities and substantial exposure to sectors adversely
affected by the financial crisis and current economic stress,”
Stanislas Rouyer, an associate managing director at the firm,
said in the statement.  Ashweeta Durani, a spokeswoman for Assured in  New York ,
said the company had no immediate comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
