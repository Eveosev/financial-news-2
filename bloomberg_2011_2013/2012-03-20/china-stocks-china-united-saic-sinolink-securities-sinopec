Shares of the following companies
had  unusual  moves in China trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses as of the close.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, fell 33.35 points, or 1.4 percent, to
2,376.84. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  declined 1.7 percent to 2,584.45.  Automakers:  SAIC Motor Corp. (600104)  (600104 CH), China’s largest
carmaker, dropped 3.8 percent to 14.35 yuan. Chongqing Changan
Automobile Co. (000625 CH), the Chinese partner of Ford Motor
Co. and Mazda Motor Corp., lost 3.9 percent to 4.45 yuan.  Total vehicle deliveries -- forecast by the China
Association of Automobile Manufacturers to grow 8 percent this
year -- may fail to increase by even 5 percent because of the
“difficult” economic backdrop, Gu Xianghua, one of two
deputies to the secretary general at CAAM, said at a conference
in Qingdao today, citing his personal opinion.  Refiners:  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028)  (600028 CH),
Asia’s biggest oil refiner, fell 0.5 percent to 7.60 yuan.
PetroChina Co. (601857 CH), the nation’s second-biggest refiner,
slipped 0.5 percent to 10.21 yuan.  Gasoline and diesel prices will rise by 600 yuan ($95) a
metric ton starting today after the three crude grades tracked
by the National Development and Reform Commission climbed more
than 10 percent, according to a statement on the planning
agency’s website yesterday. Chinese refiners are unlikely to
break even because of higher feedstock costs from the “current
oil price environment,”  Barclays Capital  said in a report.  China United Network Communications Ltd. (600050)  (600050 CH), which
controls the nation’s second-largest cell phone operator, lost
1.5 percent to 4.48 yuan, the lowest close since Aug. 22. Its
Hong Kong-listed unit China Unicom Ltd. (762 HK) said yesterday
it added the least number of third-generation subscribers last
month since October.  Sinolink Securities Co. (600109)  (600109 CH) slumped 4.7 percent to
11.63 yuan, its biggest decline since Jan. 4. The brokerage said
it would sell as many as 300 million shares for at least 10.31
yuan each in a private placement to boost capital, according to
a statement to the  Shanghai Stock Exchange .  --Zhang Shidong. Editor: Allen Wan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
