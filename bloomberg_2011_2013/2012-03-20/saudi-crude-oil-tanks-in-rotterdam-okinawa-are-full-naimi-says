Saudi Arabia ’s overseas crude
storage tanks are full, according to the country’s oil minister
Ali al-Naimi.  “Our inventories both in Saudi Arabia and worldwide are
full,” the minister said today during a meeting with seven
reporters in Doha, Qatar. “Our Rotterdam inventory is full, our
Sidi Kerir is full, our Okinawa is full. 100 percent full.”  Saudi stockpiles held at international storage facilities
are at about 10 million barrels, while local supplies are
“significantly higher,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
