Presco Plc (PRESCO) , a Nigerian palm-oil
producer, headed for its highest close in more than three years
as investors speculated it would pay a dividend for 2011.  The stock rose 4.9 percent to 9.81 naira as of 2:12 p.m. in
Lagos, the commercial capital, and headed for the highest
closing level since January 2009.  “Investors are expecting that the company will give a
dividend of at least 1 naira that it gave last year,” David
Adonri, chief executive officer of Lambeth Trust and Investment
Co., a Lagos-based brokerage, said by phone today. “At this
price, that will be a good rate.”  The stock has risen 13 percent this year, compared with a
0.9 decline in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index in
the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
