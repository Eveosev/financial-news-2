Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF)  climbed in New
York trading and helped boost  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and
 Morgan Stanley (MS)  after reporting fixed-income trading revenue
doubled.  Jefferies advanced 2.3 percent to $19.49 at 4:15 p.m. in
New York, the biggest increase in the 80-company Standard &
Poor’s Midcap Financials  Index. (S4FINL)  Goldman Sachs rose 1.4 percent
and Morgan Stanley gained 1.7 percent.  Revenue from fixed-income trading at Jefferies climbed to
$339.1 million in the fiscal first quarter, more than twice the
fourth-quarter figure, the New York-based company said today in
a statement. Net income for the three months ended Feb. 29 was
$77.1 million, or 33 cents a share, 4 cents higher than the
 average estimate  of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “We view the stronger-than-expected rebound in trading
revenues as a positive for the shares of JEF and its larger-cap
investment-bank peers,”  Jeff Harte , an analyst at Sandler
O’Neill & Partners LP, said in a note, referring to the company
by its stock symbol.  Net revenue advanced to a record $780 million in the
quarter. Revenue from sales and trading dropped 1.4 percent to
$488.5 million, and investment banking rose 20 percent to $285.8
million.  “Market prices have improved throughout fixed income for
the quarter,” Chief Executive Officer  Richard Handler , 50, said
on a conference call with investors. “The large percentage of
the gains were due to healthy customer flows and reasonable bid-
ask spreads.”  Europe Concern  Jefferies battled investor concern in November that its
European sovereign-debt holdings would lead to losses after the
Oct. 31 bankruptcy of MF Global Holdings Ltd. Handler said in
December that the speculation led to a reduction of client flows
in November.  Average daily  equity trading on major U.S. exchanges was
about 6.8 billion shares in the period, a 9.9 percent drop from
the same quarter a year earlier, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The decline helped drive Jefferies’s equity-trading
revenue down 23 percent in the quarter to $136.2 million.
Handler said equity trading picked up at the end of February.  The jump in  investment-banking  revenue was driven by
increases in the underwriting and advisory businesses. Jefferies
booked a 21 percent rise in underwriting stocks and bonds, which
rose to $135.9 million, and advisory climbed 19 percent to
$149.9 million.  Assets Decline  The firm had total assets of $34.6 billion at the end of
the quarter, compared with $35 billion as of Nov. 30. The
 leverage ratio , a measure of total assets divided by
stockholders’ equity, was 9.5-to-1, compared with 9.9-to-1 at
the end of the fiscal fourth quarter. Handler said the company
doesn’t need to expand its leverage ratio to produce returns.  “It’s not likely that their investors are going to give
them a lot of credit for earnings generated just through
increasing the leverage on their balance sheet,” Joel Jeffrey,
an analyst at KBW Inc., said today in a phone interview. “It
would be viewed as a risky way to do it.”  Jefferies set aside $446.5 million, or 57 percent of net
revenue, for compensation in the period, compared with $442.9
million a year earlier. The firm’s  headcount  rose to 3,851 from
3,082 in the year-earlier period and fell from 3,898 in the
firm’s fiscal fourth quarter.  Handler said in December he and other senior leaders at the
firm gave back their bonuses for the year. Jefferies said that
month it would claw back 2011 bonuses from any employees who
defect to competitors this year. Workers have the option to
receive the stock portion of their 2011 bonus in shares or in
cash at a 25 percent discount.  To contact the reporter on this story:
