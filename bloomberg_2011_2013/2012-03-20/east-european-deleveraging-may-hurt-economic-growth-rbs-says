Western European lenders will
continue to reduce their eastern exposure to meet stricter
regulations, curtailing access to credit and  economic growth ,
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc said.  “Distressed deleveraging will likely slow, but European
banks are still likely to want to reduce balance sheets,” RBS
emerging-markets analysts Timothy Ash and David Petitcolin wrote
in an e-mailed note yesterday. “Loan books will continue to
shrink in aggregate, which would suggest still a very weak
credit growth channel across the region, which will continue to
act as a broader drag on growth and recovery.”  New capital and liquidity requirements are forcing western
lenders controlling three quarters of eastern  Europe ’s banking
industry to sell assets and bolster capital, threatening to curb
credit needed to fund the region’s companies and households.
European bank exposure in the third quarter dropped by about 8
percent to $1.26 trillion, according to the Bank of
International Settlements, the analysts wrote in the note.  The  European Central Bank ’s cash provisions, which helped
lenders in the region’s west overcome a liquidity squeeze,
served as “the big game changer,” the analysts wrote.  “It is clear the risk of imminent banking collapse in the
 euro zone  and consequential spill-over risks in emerging Europe
has been significantly moderated,” they said in the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
