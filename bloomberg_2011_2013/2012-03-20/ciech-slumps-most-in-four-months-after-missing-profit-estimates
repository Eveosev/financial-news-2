Ciech SA (CIE)  tumbled the most in four
months after the Polish chemicals producer missed analysts’
estimates.  The stock declined as much as 8.2 percent, the most since
Nov. 2, and traded 7.7 percent lower at 17.31 zloty at 10:35
a.m. in Warsaw.  Full-year net income at the  state-controlled company  fell
to 1.5 million zloty ($480,000) from 24.3 million zloty a year
earlier after a “tough year of restructuring,” Ciech said
today in a regulatory statement. That missed the 17.7 million-
zloty  mean estimate  of three analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
