Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) ’s new smartphone
platform, Microsoft Corp.’s Windows Phone 7, outsold its older
smartphone system in the U.K. this year, market researcher
 Kantar Worldpanel  said.  About 2.5 percent of U.K. phone buyers chose a Windows
Phone compared with 2.4 percent for Espoo, Finland-based Nokia’s
older Symbian line, according to an e-mailed research report
based on interviews with mobile phone purchasers over three
months ending February 19. Nokia’s Lumia 800 accounted for 87
percent of Windows Phone 7 sales in  Europe , the Madrid-based
researcher said.  Nokia Chief Executive Officer Stephen Elop shifted the
company to Windows Phone last year, saying the long-term
potential to create a “third ecosystem” would outweigh the
short-term loss in Symbian sales.  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android and
 Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone remained the top selling smartphone systems
in the U.K., according to the study.  “The fact that Windows Phone sales have overtaken Symbian
based on one handset is encouraging,” said Dominic Sunnebo, a
London-based Kantar analyst. “However, Nokia will need to
expand the range quickly in order to keep up with the slew of
next generation competitor products being launched in quarter
two.”  Symbian declined from a 12.4 percent share in the U.K. a
year earlier and also fell to a single digit share in Germany,
France and Australia, Kantar said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
