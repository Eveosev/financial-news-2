A film dramatizing the Ottoman
Turks’ conquest of Constantinople, the city that would be
renamed Istanbul, in 1453 has become the most-watched film of
all time in  Turkey ,  Hurriyet  reported.  Producer Faruk Aksoy’s “ Fetih 1453 ,” whose name
translates as “Conquest 1453,” has been viewed in cinemas
almost 6 million times, the newspaper said.  The film, now in its fifth week of showings, takes first
place in box-office records from Aksoy’s 2009 comedy “Recep
Ivedik 2,” Hurriyet said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
