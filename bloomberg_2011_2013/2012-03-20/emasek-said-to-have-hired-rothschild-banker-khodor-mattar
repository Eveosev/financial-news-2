Khodor Mattar, a Dubai-based
director at Rothschild, is leaving the investment bank to join
 Temasek Holdings Pte (TMSK) ,  Singapore ’s state-owned investment
company, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Mattar will join Temasek’s group overseeing energy and
resources investments, said the person, who asked not to be
named as the information isn’t public. Mattar didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail and calls to his mobile phone. Temasek
spokesmen couldn’t be reached immediately.  Mattar’s move was reported earlier today by Reuters, which
cited an unidentified person familiar with the matter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
