The Italian government is seeking
to revise  labor laws  to make it easier for companies to fire
workers during economic downturns or for disciplinary reasons,
Labor Minister Elsa Fornero told unions and employers at talks
today, according to a union official.  The government wants to limit Article 18 of the labor code,
which gives labor judges the power to force companies with more
thatn 15 employees to compensate and rehire any worker deemed to
have been let go without just cause.  Prime Minister Mario Monti government wants to remove the
threat of rehiring when companies fire workers for economic
reasons, Fornero told the meeting, the official said. In cases
where a court overules a company that fires a worker for
disciplinary reasons, compensation would be limited to 27 weeks
and a judge would be able to order the workerâ€™s reinstatement.  Article 18 would not change for other types of dismissals
if a court ruled a company lacked just cause, Fornero said. That
protection would be extended to all companies, Fornero said.
Currently it only applies to companies with more than 15
workers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
