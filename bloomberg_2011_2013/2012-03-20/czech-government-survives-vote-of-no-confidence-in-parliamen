Czech Premier Petr Necas’s
government survived a no-confidence vote in parliament initiated
by the opposition in a protest against the administration’s
austerity measures.  The government was supported by 113 lawmakers in the 200-
seat chamber of parliament, results of the vote showed. The
opposition mustered 85 votes against the Cabinet, short of the
101 mandates it needed to oust the 19-month-old administration.  Necas’s three-party coalition plans to freeze budget
spending to cut the budget shortfall this year and is
considering raising the value-added tax to meet its deficit
target in 2013. The Cabinet already increased the VAT rate at
the beginning of this year.  The  Social Democrats , the largest opposition party, opposes
the government’s austerity plans saying they are hurting poorer
Czechs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
