Thailand ’s Cabinet approved
development proposals for five southern provinces, Cabinet
Secretary Ampon Kittiampon said.  Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has asked the operators
of individual projects to conduct public opinion and
environmental impact studies before making a budget request,
Ampon told reporters today. Funding may also come from state
agencies or through joint ventures, he said.  A committee led by Yingluck yesterday approved a three-
year, 5.79 billion-baht ($188 million) plan to increase the
annual capacity of Phuket’s airport to 12.5 million passengers.
The committee also proposed a dual-track railway between Bangkok
and Padang Besar near the Malaysian border that will cost about
20 billion baht.  The committee also agreed to study a proposed rail route
along the Andaman coast valued at 58 billion baht, said
Payungsak Chartsutipol, chairman of the Federation of Thai
Industries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
