Barton Biggs , the hedge-fund
manager who increased bets on equities before the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index rallied this year, is getting more bullish.  “I’ve been gradually increasing and I’m up to 90 percent
now,” said Biggs, referring to the proportion of his fund that
benefits from higher share prices. He spoke in a radio interview
today on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with Tom Keene. “There is
an awful lot of money that is out of stocks and in very low-
yielding fixed-income instruments. I think the odds are that
money is going to migrate back.”  Biggs, the founder of the Traxis Partners LP, said last
month that his net-long position, a gauge of bullish versus
bearish investments, in stocks is about 75 percent, up from 65
percent in January. His optimism fluctuated along with the
market, with at least eight changes in the past six months,
according to interviews with Bloomberg.  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  has rallied 12 percent this year and is on pace
for the best first quarter since 1998 amid better-than-estimated
economic reports and confidence that Europe’s debt crisis won’t
derail the global recovery. The index is 10 percent below its
October 2007 record of 1,565.15. It trades at about 14.5 times
 reported earnings , the highest valuation level since July, while
still below the average since 1954 of 16.4.  The benchmark gauge for U.S. equities fell 0.3 percent to
1,405.52 in New York today.  Net-Long Positions  Biggs reduced the net-long position in the Traxis Global
Equity Macro Fund to about 40 percent at the end of September
before increasing it to 65 percent on Oct. 17 and 80 percent on
Oct. 31, according to interviews with Bloomberg. On Nov. 21, he
said he cut the level to less than 40 percent. On Dec. 2, he
said he boosted it to about 60 percent.  Biggs said on Dec. 12 that he was investing in U.S. and
Asian stocks. He said at the time that equities might rise or
fall 20 percent because of concern about budget negotiations and
 Europe . The  S&P 500  rose 14 percent from that day through
yesterday, while the MSCI All-Country Asia Pacific Index
advanced 11 percent.  He sees risk to the markets from tensions in the  Middle
East . If Israel were to “take a shot” at Iran, it “would be
very, very serious for the world economy and would cause a
double dip,” Biggs said today.  “The ‘gloom crew’ is looking over their shoulders at
what’s happened, and it certainly isn’t a perfect world,” he
said.  Biggs said today that while the problems in Europe haven’t
been solved, he is encouraged by the quality of the leadership
at the  European Central Bank  and the  International Monetary
Fund , and in  Italy .  To contact the reporters on this story:
