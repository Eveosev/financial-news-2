Kuwait plans to issue a tender
within four weeks to choose consultants for its new refinery and
clean-fuel projects, the state-run news agency  KUNA  reported
today, citing an official.  Each consulting contract will cost about $300 million and
there may be as many as nine international pre-qualified
consultants for the projects, the news service cited Fahad al-
Ajmi, chairman of Kuwait National Petroleum Co., as saying. The
budget for the projects, planned to be completed by 2018, is
about 8.5 billion dinars ($30.5 billion), al-Ajmi said,
according to KUNA.  Kuwait National, the state-run refiner, is awaiting final
approval from the Supreme Petroleum Council, the country’s
highest decision-making body for oil policy, on the 615,000
barrel-a-day refinery. Kuwait National approached companies
including  Fluor Corp. (FLR)  of Irving,  Texas ,  Technip SA (TEC)  and U.K.-
based  Amec Plc (AMEC)  to work as project management consultants, KNPC’s
spokesman said in a Sept. 27 interview.  The Al-Zour project, which will help meet domestic demand,
stalled three years ago amid political opposition. The project
got the first approval from the Supreme Council last June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
