The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars fell against their U.S. counterpart as stocks declined
amid damped demand for higher-yielding assets.  The Aussie and kiwi extended yesterday’s drops, which came
after  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s biggest mining company,
said steel output growth in  China  has slowed as it puts greater
focus on consumers rather than building projects. The currencies
earlier gained after Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  won
parliamentary approval for a 130 billion-euro ($172 billion)
international bailout. The currencies have rallied against the
dollar this year.  “It might be a feeling that this move is getting a little
bit overextended,” said Carl Forcheski, a director on the
corporate currency sales desk at Societe Generale SA in New
York. “The market is getting a bit tired up here and at some
point it’s going to correct.”  Australia’s currency fell 0.4 percent to $1.0438 at 11:43
a.m. in  New York  after declining 1.2 percent yesterday, the
sharpest slide since Dec. 12. It rose as much as 0.5 percent
earlier. The Aussie dropped 0.3 percent to 87.44 yen after
dropping 0.8 percent yesterday, the most since March 12.  New Zealand’s dollar lost 0.5 percent to 81.32 U.S. cents,
after earlier rising 0.6 percent, and slumped 0.4 percent to
68.12 yen. The MSCI World Index of equities dropped 0.3 percent.  The kiwi has gained 4.6 percent against the dollar this
year and the Aussie has added 2.2 percent.  Australia’s currency weakened yesterday on concern an
economic slowdown in China, the nation’s biggest trading
partner, would damp demand for its commodity exports.  Earnings from  Australia ’s minerals and energy exports may
total A$199.2 billion ($208 billion) in the year ending June 30,
the Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics said in a report
today. That compares with a December forecast of a record
A$205.8 billion, and A$179.2 billion a year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
