Passport Capital LLC, the $3.8
billion hedge fund run by  John Burbank , fired 14 employees
within the past week after losses in 2011, said two people with
knowledge of the the matter.  Passport’s dismissals include seven employees on the
investment staff, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the information is private. Passport, which
slumped 18 percent in 2011, gained 3.7 percent this year through
February, the people said.  “We made the difficult decision to do some downsizing of
staff last week, reducing to approximately the headcount we had
at the beginning of 2011,” San Francisco-based Passport said in
an e-mailed statement.  Steve Bruce , a spokesman for the firm, declined to comment
on the firings beyond the statement.  Passport, a multistrategy hedge fund, was founded by
Burbank in 2000 and now employs 76 people, 34 of whom are
investment staff, one of the people said. It invests in
agriculture, basic materials, energy, financial services, health
care,  capital markets  and the Internet, among other things,
according to the firm’s website.  Hedge funds , which lost 5.8 percent on average last year
amid concern the European debt crisis would worsen, gained 3.6
percent in the first two months of 2012 on expectations it would
be contained, according to the Bloomberg aggregate hedge fund
 index .  To contact the reporters on this story:
