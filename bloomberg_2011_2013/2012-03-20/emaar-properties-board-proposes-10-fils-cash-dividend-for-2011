Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR)  retreated the
most in two weeks after a 10 fils cash dividend for 2011
proposed by the board of the United Arab Emirates’ biggest
developer fell short of investor expectations.  Emaar, developer of the world’s tallest tower in Dubai,
slumped 2.6 percent, the most since March 7, to 2.97 dirhams at
the 2 p.m. close in the emirate. The decline dragged Dubai’s DFM
General Index 1.5 percent lower to 1,643.31. Emaar also paid a
10 fils  dividend  for 2010 after it hadn’t initially proposed
one. That decision was made after a heated three-hour meeting
between shareholders and executives.  “There were speculations about dividend as high as 15
fils,” said Dubai-based Fadi Al Said, who oversees $250 million
as senior investment manager at ING Investment Management for
the  Middle East  and North Africa. “Since the company maintained
the dividend, it may be a positive sign that it’s comfortable
with its financial position.”  Emaar,  owned 31 percent  by Dubai’s government, didn’t
distribute dividends in 2009 and 2008, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Its profit plunged 89 percent and 54
percent those years, respectively, as the company that derives
more than  90 percent of revenue domestically  suffered when
Dubai’s real-estate crash dragged  home prices  down 65 percent
from a mid-2008 peak.  Profit Doubles  The developer said last month its fourth-quarter profit
more than doubled to 716 million dirhams ($195 million), beating
analysts’ estimates. Recurring income from hotels and malls grew
to 41 percent of revenue last year compared with 24 percent in
2010.  The shareholders are scheduled to meet on April 23 to
discuss the dividend proposal, the company  said in a statement 
to the  Dubai Financial Market  today. Emaar said yesterday that
it may expand its board to 11 members from eight and replace
four directors.  Emaar’s shares  have gained 16 percent this year compared
with a 21 percent advance for the benchmark Dubai Financial
Market General Index. Fifteen analysts  recommend  investors buy
Emaar shares, two have a hold rating and one a sell
recommendation, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
