French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
narrowed his deficit against Socialist candidate  Francois Hollande  to 1 point in an Ipsos SA poll of voting intentions in
the first round of the election in 33 days.  Hollande would get 28.5 percent and Sarkozy 27.5 percent in
the April 22 first round with Sarkozy up 2.5 percentage points
and Hollande down a point. The gap was 3.5 percentage points in
a March 3 poll by Ipsos for  France  Televisions, Radio France and
Le Monde newspaper showed.  For the second round on May 6, Hollande’s lead narrowed to
55 percent against 44 for Sarkozy, compared with a 16-point lead
in the previous poll.  Paris-based Ipsos interviewed 950 respondents aged 18 and
more, by telephone on March 16 and 17. Ipsos didn’t publish
margins of error.  The Ipsos poll follows surveys by the Ifop polling
institute published last week that showed Sarkozy taking the
lead in the first round.  National Front’s Marine Le Pen gathered 15 percent support,
 Francois Bayrou  of the centrist Democratic Movement 13 percent
support and Left Front candidate Jean-Luc Melanchon 11.5
percent, up two percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
