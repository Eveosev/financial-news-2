Shares of the following companies
had  unusual  moves in  Indonesian trading . Stock symbols are in

largest coal producer, fell 1 percent to 2,400 rupiah and  PT
Tambang Batubara Bukit Asam (PTBA)  , a state-coal producer,
slid 0.2 percent to 20,500 rupiah.  Indonesia needs to further study a plan to ban the sale of
lower-quality coal from 2014, according to Edi Prasodjo, the
coal business director at the ministry. The government hasn’t
set a target for when the ban will be applied or which type of
coal it will affect because it’s still seeking feedback from
miners, Prasodjo said.  PT Indofood Sukses Makmur (INDF)  , the parent of the
nation’s biggest instant-noodle maker gained 0.5 percent to
4,925 rupiah. Indofood’s 2011 net income rose to 3.08 trillion
rupiah from 2.95 trillion rupiah a year earlier, the company
said in a statement published in  Bisnis Indonesia .  PT Indofood CBP Sukses Makmur (ICBP)  , Indonesia’s

from 1.7 trillion rupiah a year earlier, the company said in a
statement published today in Bisnis Indonesia.  PT Kalbe Farma (KLBF)  , the pharmaceutical company rose
0.7 percent to 3,450 rupiah. Kalbe is in talks with five to
eight firms in the region for acquisitions as the cash-rich firm

Vidjongtius, a director at the company. A call to Vidjongtius’s
office wasn’t answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
