Restore Our Future, the political
action committee backing  Mitt Romney  for president, spent $12.2
million last month -- more than $400,000 a day -- as the former
Massachusetts governor won the Michigan Republican primary and
prepared for Super Tuesday.  Red White and Blue Fund, a super-PAC backing former U.S.
Senator  Rick Santorum  of Pennsylvania, spent $3.2 million in
February. It received $600,000 from Wyoming investor Foster Friess and $500,000 from Louisiana energy executive William
Dore, both of whom had previously donated $1 million to the PAC.  The super-PAC backing  Newt Gingrich , Winning Our Future,
spent $5.8 million in support of the former U.S. House speaker
last month, helped by $5 million from  Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS) 
Chairman  Sheldon Adelson  and his wife, Miriam. The couple also
gave $10 million to the PAC in January. The Adelsons’ daughter,
Shelley, gave $500,000 in February.  Restore Our Future, the pro-Romney group, spent $10.1
million on television ads, $775,000 on  Internet advertising  and
$523,000 on direct mail last month, according to documents filed
today with the Federal Election Commission. The spending helped
Romney swamp his competitors on the airwaves, with most of the
ads attacking his rivals.  After winning Michigan, Romney defeated Santorum in the key
state of Ohio on Super Tuesday, March 6.  Houston Homebuilder  Restore Our Future took in $6.4 million in February, with
$3 million coming from Houston homebuilder Bob Perry, who helped
fund the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth ads that attacked
Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry’s Vietnam War service
during the 2004 campaign. Perry gave $1 million to the super-PAC
last year.  The committee, which can take in unlimited donations,
received $100,000 apiece from Harold Simmons, chairman of
Dallas-based Contran Corp., and $100,000 from  Kenneth Griffin ,
president of the Chicago-based hedge fund Citadel LLC. Both
Simmons and Griffin each had donated $100,000 to the PAC
earlier. Simmons also gave $100,000 to Gingrich’s PAC after
donating $500,000 earlier.  Through Feb. 29, Restore Our Future raised $43.2 million
and had $10.5 million to spend.  Romney previously announced that his campaign had raised
$11.5 million in February, more than any other Republican.  Pro-Santorum Group  The pro-Santorum PAC raised $5.8 million through Feb. 29,
including $2.9 million in February. It received $1 million from
Simmons’s wife, Annette. The PAC had $365,000 left to spend at
the end of the month, or less than 4 percent of what the pro-
Romney PAC had left to spend.  The pro-Gingrich PAC raised $18.9 million through Feb. 29,
including $5.7 million last month, and had $2.3 million in the
bank, less than one-fourth of the pro-Romney PAC.  Endorse Liberty, the super-PAC backing Texas Representative
 Ron Paul  for president, said it brought in $282,467 last month,
ending up with $206,778 in the bank. The PAC has raised $4.1
million overall.  Priorities USA Action, a super-PAC supporting President
 Barack Obama , raised $2 million in February, including $1
million from comedian  Bill Maher . It began this month with $2.8
million in the bank. Jim Messina, Obama’s campaign manager, said
Feb. 6 that White House and Cabinet officials would begin
helping the super-PAC raise money to take on Republican groups.  To contact the reporters on this story:
