Copper declined on concerns that
high inventories in  Shanghai  won’t be absorbed any time soon
amid slowing growth in the world’s second-largest economy. Zinc
and nickel also fell.  Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange lost as
much as 0.6 percent to $8,520 a metric ton and traded at $8,531
by 1:49 p.m. Shanghai time. The June-delivery contract traded
little changed at 60,250 yuan ($9,533) a ton on the Shanghai
Futures Exchange.  “Domestic demand isn’t particularly bad, but the inventory
level is too high,” Wang Ning, an analyst at Xiangyu Futures
Co., said by phone from Shanghai.  Copper inventories at bonded warehouses in Shanghai climbed
to 530,000 tons last week, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of seven traders and analysts. This
compares with about 200,000 tons in the fourth quarter, said Qu
Yi, an analyst at CRU International Ltd.  May-delivery metal on the Comex dropped 0.6 percent to
$3.8840 a pound.  On the LME, zinc fell 0.4 percent to $2,070 and nickel
declined 0.4 percent to $18,979 a ton. Aluminum dropped 0.2
percent to $2,269.75 a ton and lead dropped 0.4 percent to
$2,096.75 a ton. Tin was little changed at $23,600 a ton.  Metal is being moved within warehouses monitored by the
London Metal Exchange, and “causing problems for copper,” said
Michael Jansen, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
