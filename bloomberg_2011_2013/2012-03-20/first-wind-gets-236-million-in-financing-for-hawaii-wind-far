First Wind Holdings LLC (WIND) , a closely
held wind-farm developer, received a $220 million construction
loan and $16 million in letters of credit for a project in
 Hawaii .  Construction began on the 69-megawatt Kawailoa project in
December and it’s expected to be completed by the end of this
year, Boston-based First Wind said today in a statement.  Siemens
AG (SIE)  is providing turbines and Hawaiian Electric Co. received
approval in December from state regulators to buy the project’s
electricity.  Union Bank NA, Bayern LB, Rabobank Groep NV and Siemens
Financial Services Inc. led the financing. Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce and CoBank ACB also participated, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
