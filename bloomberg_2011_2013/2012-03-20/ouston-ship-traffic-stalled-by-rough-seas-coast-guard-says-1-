Traffic in the  Houston Ship
Channel , which leads to the largest petroleum port in the U.S.,
was stalled because of high seas.  The Houston Pilots, whose members guide tankers and other
deep-draft ships through the channel, halted boardings yesterday
at 10:40 p.m. local time, Coast Guard Lieutenant Junior Grade
 Michael Scott  said today in a telephone interview.  The suspension stalled 39 ships, including 18 bound for
Houston and 21 waiting to leave the port, he said. Seas too
rough for pilots to board vessels safely were whipped up by a
line of severe thunderstorms west of Houston, Scott said.  The  National Weather Service   posted  a severe thunderstorm
watch for 19 southeast Texas counties until 9 a.m. today, an
area that includes Houston and Galveston.  To contact the reporter on this story:
