Ukraine’s government has enough
funds to repay and service its debt this year, a  Finance
Ministry  official said after the former Soviet state indicated
it may seek to restructure a bailout loan.  The government has accumulated about $2 billion to repay
foreign debt, according to Halyna Pakhachuk, who heads the
ministry’s financial policy and government-debt management
department.  “Our policy allows us to service of our all debts,” she
told reporters today in the capital, Kiev. “The budget law
envisages a plan for borrowing and debt repayments and that plan
is being followed on time.”  Ukraine is seeking to bolster public finances by agreeing
with  Russia  on a cheaper price for natural-gas imports or
restarting a $15.6 billion loan from the  International Monetary
Fund  that was frozen last year. It wants to postpone $3 billion
of repayments under an earlier loan from the Washington-based
fund, First Deputy Economy Minister Vadym Kopylov said March 15.  Ukraine must repay 42.27 billion hryvnia ($5.3 billion) of
foreign debt in 2012, according to the  Finance Ministry , which
has raised 12 billion hryvnia domestically so far, about $810
million of which was through sales of dollar-denominated bonds.
The government plans to borrow more domestically this year to
“optimize” its debt and ensure a “positive” effect on
economic growth, Pakhachuk said.  Gross external debt rose 7.6 percent to $126.24 billion in
2011, with more than two thirds denominated in dollars and about
10 percent in euros, the central bank said today on its website.
Total external debt equaled 77 percent of gross domestic product
last year, down from 85 percent in 2010, the bank said.  Short-term debt rose to $56.8 billion as of Jan. 1 from
$50.37 billion a year earlier, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
