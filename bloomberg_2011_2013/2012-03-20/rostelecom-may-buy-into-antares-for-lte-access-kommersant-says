OAO Antares, which owns so-called
long term evolution frequencies in  Russia , is offering to sell a
controlling stake to state-controlled OAO Rostelecom, Kommersant
reported, citing unidentified industry officials and a
representative of Antares.  The companies may be able to cut costs by using the same
infrastructure for both Antaresâ€™s LTE frequencies and third-
generation frequencies that Rostelecom is set to acquire after
buying Sky Link, an affiliate that plans to start rolling out 3G
in the third quarter, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
