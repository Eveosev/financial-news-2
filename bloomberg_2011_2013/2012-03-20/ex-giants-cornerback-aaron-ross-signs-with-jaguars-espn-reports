Former  New York  Giants cornerback
Aaron Ross agreed on a three-year contract with the Jacksonville
Jaguars worth as much as $15.3 million,  ESPN said , citing an
unidentified National Football League official.  Ross, 29, had a career-high four interceptions for the
Super Bowl-champion Giants last season, starting 15 of 16 games
following an injury to  Terrell Thomas .  A first-round draft pick in 2007, Ross was the Giants’
third cornerback behind Thomas and Corey Webster during the 2010
season. Thomas and Webster are projected as starters in New York
next season, with Prince Amukamara, the team’s first-round pick
last year, as the third cornerback.  To contact the reporter on this story:
