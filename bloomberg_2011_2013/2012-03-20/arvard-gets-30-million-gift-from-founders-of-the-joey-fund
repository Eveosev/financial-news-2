     March 20 (Bloomberg) -- Harvard University , the oldest and
richest U.S. college, received a $30 million donation from
Joseph and Kathy O’Donnell, who started the Joey Fund to benefit
cystic fibrosis patients and research in 1986.  The gift is intended to support planning and spur donors as
Harvard plans a major fundraising effort that will help shape
the university’s future, the school in Cambridge,  Massachusetts ,
said today in a  statement  on its website.  A graduate of Harvard College and  Harvard Business School ,
where he once served as associated dean, Joseph O’Donnell has
been an active volunteer at the college, Harvard said in the
statement. The institution has made a difference to families
around the world, as it has in theirs, O’Donnell said.  “We’ve reached a significant moment in Harvard’s long
history, and what we do today will, in large measure, enable the
University to expand its critical work in the years ahead -- not
only in Cambridge but also globally,” O’Donnell said.  Joseph O’Donnell is the founder of Boston Culinary Group, a
food service corporation. He and his wife established the  Joey
Fund  in memory of their son who died at age 12 of cystic
fibrosis. The group has raised more than $35 million since its
founding, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
