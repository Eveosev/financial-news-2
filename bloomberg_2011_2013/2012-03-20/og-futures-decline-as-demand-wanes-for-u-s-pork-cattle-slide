Hog futures fell for a fifth
straight session, heading for the longest slump since October,
on speculation that U.S. pork demand is waning. Cattle dropped
to the lowest price in more than two months.  Wholesale  pork  slid to 82.29 cents a pound yesterday, the
lowest since January 2011, U.S. Department of Agriculture data
show.  Stockpiles  of the meat totaled 584.4 million pounds at the
end of January, 8.5 percent more than a year earlier, the most
recent government data show. The USDA will update its inventory
figure on March 22.  “The meat complex in general is softer,” Lawrence Kane, a
market adviser at Stewart-Peterson Group in  Yates City ,
 Illinois , said in a telephone interview. In the USDA report,
“people are looking for another increase, so that’s one of the
negatives. The question is: How big of an increase do we see? We
have plenty of pork.”  Hog futures for June settlement dropped 0.7 percent to
92.775 cents a pound at 10:04 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The last time prices posted a five-session slide was
on Oct. 27.  Cattle futures for June delivery were down less than 0.1
percent at $1.221 a pound in Chicago, after touching $1.214, the
lowest for a most-active contract since Jan. 10. The price
touched a record $1.315 on Feb. 22.  Feeder-cattle futures for May settlement slid 0.1 percent
to $1.5455 a pound on the CME, after falling to $1.534, the
lowest since Feb. 10.  Wholesale choice beef, which rose 1 percent yesterday to
$1.9174 a pound, is still down 4.6 percent since reaching the
highest prices since at least 2004 on Feb. 29, USDA data show.
U.S. export  sales  of beef fell to 8,769 metric tons in the week
ended March 8, the least since January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
