Thailand ’s baht snapped a two-day
gain on speculation importers are stepping up purchases of the
dollar to replace machinery damaged by last year’s floods.  The currency touched the strongest level in almost a week
yesterday as overseas investors purchased $106 million more
local equities than they sold, taking net buying this month to
$690 million, exchange data show. Foreign funds bought a net
$2.2 billion of government debt in March, according to data from
the Thai Bond Market Association.  “Appreciation pressure on the baht was countered by dollar
demand from importers,” said Kozo Hasegawa, a trader at
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. in Bangkok. “The baht may stay in
quite a narrow range for a while.”  The baht weakened 0.1 percent to 30.75 per dollar as of
8:49 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency touched 30.67 yesterday, the strongest level since
March 14. It may trade between 30.50 and 30.85 for the rest of
this week, Hasegawa said. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of foreign-exchange swings used to price options, was
unchanged at 6.5250 percent.  The yield on the 3.25 percent government notes due June
2017 was little changed at 3.61 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Onshore interest-rate swaps fell before the central bank
reviews borrowing costs tomorrow. Nineteen of 21 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the rate will be held at 3
percent, while two predict a 25-basis point cut. One-year swaps,
the fixed cost needed to receive a floating payment, dropped
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.06 percent.  “The main forecast is for no change at tomorrow’s BOT
meeting, so we don’t see much impact on the currency from
that,” Hasegawa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
