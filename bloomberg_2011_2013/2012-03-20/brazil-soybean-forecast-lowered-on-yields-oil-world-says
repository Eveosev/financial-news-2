South American soybean production
will be less than previously expected after conditions
deteriorated because of dry and hot conditions in southern
 Brazil  and northern  Argentina , Oil World said.  Output in  South America  may slide to 120.6 million metric
tons from 136.5 million tons in 2010-11, the Hamburg-based
oilseed researcher wrote in a report today, cutting its outlook
for at least the fifth time since December.  Soybean futures have gained 12 percent on the Chicago Board
of Trade this year, compared with corn’s 1.2 percent rise and
little changed wheat prices, on concern adverse weather will
curb supplies of the oilseed.  “It is now getting more and more likely that world soybean
production will decline by an unprecedented quantity,” Oil
World wrote. The drop may equal 22 million to 23 million tons
this season, according to Oil World.  World soybean production is forecast to decline to 243.2
million tons from 265.8 million tons, the researcher said.  Brazilian soybean farmers will harvest 66.5 million tons of
the oilseed, 1.5 million tons less than its previous forecast
and down from 75.3 million tons in 2010-11, on lack of moisture
in the southern regions of  Rio Grande  do Sul, Santa Catarina and
Parana, as well as damage from Asian rust fungus in Mato Grosso,
according to Oil World.  “The drought in Rio Grande do Sul is considered the worst
in many years,” Oil World wrote. “In Mato Grosso, damage from
Asian rust is considered the worst in five years and will
probably exceed 1 million tons.”  Argentina’s soybean crop is forecast to slide to 46.5
million tons from 49.2 million tons, 500,000 tons less than
forecast in February, the Oil World report showed. Farmers in
 Paraguay  will produce 4 million tons, less than half of their
2010-11 production, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
