The budget proposed today by
Republican House Budget Committee Chairman  Paul Ryan  would
“guarantee there will be no farm bill this year,” Minnesota
Representative Colin Peterson said.  Republican leaders, in attempting to avoid defense cuts,
have chosen to “leave farmers and hungry families hurting,”
Peterson, the ranking Democrat on the House Agriculture
Committee, said in an e-mailed message. Ryan’s plan would cut
$30 billion from agriculture spending over 10 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
