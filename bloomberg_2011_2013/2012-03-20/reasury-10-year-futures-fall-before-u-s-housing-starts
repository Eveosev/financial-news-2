Treasury 10-year futures contracts
were about 0.2 percent from the lowest level since October
before a government report economists said will show U.S.
homebuilding climbed to a three-month high.  Ten-year notes dropped for a ninth day yesterday, the
longest stretch since June 2006, as investors bet a
strengthening economy will diminish the refuge appeal of U.S.
government securities. A 10th decline today would be the longest
stretch since April 1974 following the OPEC  oil embargo . Markets
were closed in  Japan  today for a holiday.  “The data have been getting better,” said Roger Bridges,
who oversees the equivalent of $15.9 billion of debt as the
Sydney-based head of fixed income at Tyndall Investment
Management Ltd., a unit of Nikko Asset Management Co. “U.S. 10-
year notes still look expensive.” Bridges said he is holding
fewer Treasuries than the percentage in the benchmark he uses to
gauge performance.  Ten-year Treasury futures contracts for June delivery rose
2/32, or 63 cents per $1,000 face amount, to 128 1/32 as of 1:58
p.m. in  Singapore . They were as low as 127 25/32 earlier in
Asian trading, a level not seen since Oct. 28.  Yields (USGG10YR)  on 10-year notes rose as much as 10 basis points, or
0.10 percentage point, to 2.39 percent yesterday, the most since
Oct. 28. The rate was 2.38 percent at the end of the day in  New
York . They are still less than the average of 3.87 percent over
the past decade.  U.S. Housing  The increase helped push up real estate borrowing costs,
with the average U.S. 30-year fixed mortgage  rate  rising to a
four-month high of 4.05 percent, according to Bankrate.com in
 North Palm Beach ,  Florida . The  rate  is 1.67 percentage points
more than 10-year yields, the narrowest difference since July.  Housing starts probably rose to a 700,000 annual rate last
month from a 699,000 pace in January, according to the median
 estimate  of 80 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The figure
would be the strongest reading since November’s three-year high
of 702,000.  Treasuries have fallen enough that they are beginning to
attract investors.  “Yields overshot,” said Will Tseng, who trades the
securities at Taipei-based Shin Kong Life Insurance Co., which
has the equivalent of $52.1 billion in assets. “I will
definitely jump in” if rates rise further. Tseng said he is
planning to buy 10-year Treasuries at 2.4 percent.  Volatility  Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE  index , which measures
price swings based on options, rose to 92.3 basis points
yesterday. It was the highest level this year.  The 14-day  relative strength  index for 10-year note yields
was at a level indicating they may not rise much further. The
index was 76.5 yesterday, exceeding 70 for a fourth day. A
reading of more than 70 suggests to some traders that rates may
be about to reverse direction.  Futures contracts trimmed losses today as the MSCI Asia
Pacific excluding Japan Index of shares declined 0.5 percent,
dropping for a fourth day.  Treasuries fell after the  Federal Reserve  raised its
assessment of the economy last week, reducing speculation about
additional asset purchases known as quantitative easing.  “It feels like continued liquidation,” said  Brian Edmonds , head of  interest rates  at Cantor Fitzgerald LP in New
York, one of the 21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed.
“We’ve seen a dramatic move in a quick period of time.”  Policy Outlook  Fed Bank of New York President William C. Dudley said
yesterday that policy makers may raise interest rates sooner or
later than 2014, in a speech in Melville, New York. Fed said in
its statement last week that it will probably keep the benchmark
close to zero through at least the later part of that year.  Real yields, or what investors get after inflation, are
improving. The benchmark that the Fed targets, the annual change
in the  price index  for personal consumption expenditures, is at
2.4 percent, two basis points more than 10-year Treasury rates.
The real yield of negative two basis points compares to negative
1.19 percentage points in October.  The central bank in January set a target of 2 percent for
the gauge.  Using the Labor Department’s consumer price index, the
yield after inflation is negative 52 basis points, about a
quarter of the deficit in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
