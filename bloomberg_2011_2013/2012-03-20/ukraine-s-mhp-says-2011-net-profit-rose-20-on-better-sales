Mironovskiy Hleboproduct SA (MHPC) , a
Ukrainian poultry and grain producer, said profit rose 20
percent last year as it sold more chicken at higher prices and
land acquisitions boosted its harvest.  Net income jumped to $259 million on revenue that was 30
percent higher at $1.23 billion, the Kiev-based company said in
an e-mailed statement today. Sales volume rose 12 percent to
370,900 tons.  The company “delivered a strong financial performance
across our chicken, grain growing and other agricultural
divisions,” Chief Executive Officer Yuriy Kosyuk said in the
statement. Field expansion in 2010 helped to generate
“outstanding profit” from grain.  Ukraine relies on agriculture to boost economic growth,
which accelerated to 5.2 percent last year as other east
European states struggled against recession. The former Soviet
republic reaped a record 56.7 million tons of grain, 44 percent
higher than in 2010. Mironovskiy harvested 1.7 million tons,
according to the statement.  Grain Yields  MHP, which raised $322.5 million in a May 2008 initial
public offering in  London , announced a year ago plans to expand
land holdings to 0.5 million hectares (1.2 million acres) and
boost grain exports. The company said it achieved average grain
yields  “significantly” higher than Ukraine’s average.  Chicken prices rose 10 percent in 2011 and export sales
increased almost 80 percent, partly because of new markets in
 Libya , Lebanon, Uzbekistan and Angola, MHP said. The company is
looking at further export markets in  Africa , the  Middle East  and
 Asia , CEO Kosyuk said in a phone interview after the results
were released.  He said MHP is preparing to increase exports after the
Vinnytsya poultry complex, which begins trial production this
year, raises output to full planned capacity in 2015 or 2016.
The plan is for Vinnytsya to produce 220,000 tons of chicken a
year from 2015, according to the statement.  Vinnytsya will supply mainly the domestic market once it
starts, the CEO said, adding that consumption of chicken in
Ukraine may grow by 20 to 25 percent a year.  MHP is in “active talks” to acquire processing and
distribution facilities in  Europe , Kosyuk said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
