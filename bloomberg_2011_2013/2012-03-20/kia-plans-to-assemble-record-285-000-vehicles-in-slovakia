Kia Motors Corp. (000270)  plans to increase
car output at its Slovak unit 13 percent next year, benefiting
from rising demand for sport-utility vehicles.  The South Korean carmaker’s Slovak unit wants to produce
more than 285,000 vehicles this year, the company based in
Zilina, Northern Slovakia, said in an e-mailed statement today.
Last year it assembled a record 252,000 cars, a 10 percent
increase from 2010.  SUVs represented more than half of Kia’s Slovak output last
year as the company and its affiliate  Hyundai Motors Co. (005380)  are
tapping rising demand for such models to gain market share in
 Europe . The carmaker produces Kia Sportage and until June also
assembled the Hyundai-brand ix35 in Zilina.  Additional models made at the 1.1 billion-euro ($1.5
billion) plant, which became operational in 2006, are Kia’s
cee’d and Venga cars. Last year, it also boosted production of
engines 12 percent to 359,000 units.  To contact the reporter on this story:
