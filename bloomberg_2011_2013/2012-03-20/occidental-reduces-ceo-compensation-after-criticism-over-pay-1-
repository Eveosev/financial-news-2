Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) , the
fourth-largest U.S. oil company, reduced new Chief Executive
Officer Stephen I. Chazen’s compensation package after facing
criticism for former CEO Ray R. Irani’s salary in 2010.  Chazen, who became CEO in May, received $31.7 million in
2011 compared with $38.1 million the year before when he was
president, according to a  filing  today with the U.S. Securities
& Exchange Commission. Chazen’s compensation included $1.27
million in salary, a $1.34 million bonus and $28.6 million in
cash and stock awards.  Irani received $49.8 million in cash, stock and other
benefits versus $76.1 million in 2010, when his compensation
nearly doubled, making him the highest-paid CEO in the  energy
industry . Irani retired as CEO and became executive chairman.  Occidental announced revisions to the compensation plan in
October 2010 after the hedge fund Relational Investors
criticized his pay and called for changes on the Los Angeles-
based company’s board, according to a statement released at the
time. The previous pay formula included incentives based on the
company’s returns, established in 2007.  Irani’s 2011 pay included $1.3 million in salary, a $1.25
million bonus and $45.5 million in cash and stock awards.  Occidental fell 3.5 percent to $97.96 at the close in  New
York . The shares have risen 4.6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
