Canadian planting of canola may
jump 6.6 percent to 12 percent to a record this year as farmers
respond to higher prices, Oil World said.  Canola planting in the country is forecast to exceed the
European Union’s combined sowing of winter and spring rapeseed
for the first time, the Hamburg-based oilseed researcher said
today in an e-mailed report.  Production of the oilseed may climb to between 15 million
and 15.4 million metric tons from about 14.4 million tons a year
earlier and 13.1 million tons in 2010, according to Oil World.
Plantings will gain to 8.1 million to 8.5 million hectares (20
million to 21 million acres), from 7.6 million hectares a year
earlier.  “Farmers are expected to respond to the recent price
increase in the futures and cash markets,” Oil World wrote.
“Canola increased more sharply than grain prices on concern
about prospective tighter-than-expected old-crop canola stocks
as of end July 2012.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
