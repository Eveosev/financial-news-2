South Korea  should revise a
bilateral nuclear accord with the U.S. so that it can export
reactor technology in an expanding global atomic power plant
market, a Seoul-based private research institute said.  The agreement, which restricts South Korea from exporting
the technology independently, must reflect the country’s status
as the world’s fifth-largest reactor operator, Jang Woo Seok, a
research fellow at  Hyundai Research Institute , said in a note.  The world’s nuclear power project construction market may
reach as much as $1.15 trillion by 2030 with the addition of up
to 350 reactors, the institute estimated. South Korea had to
seek the consent of the U.S. after winning its first order in
2009 to export nuclear reactor technology to the  United Arab
Emirates , according to the note.  Talks with the U.S. on revising the agreement, signed in
1974, started in October 2010. The government should seek to
shorten the terms of the accord, expiring in 2014, according to
Hyundai Research.  Under the agreement, South Korea is also not allowed to
reprocess nuclear power plant fuel until 2020. The Ministry of
 Knowledge Economy  has said the country’s temporary waste
repository will run out of space in 2016.  South Korea started trial operations of its first nuclear
power plant in 1977, and currently operates 21 reactors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
