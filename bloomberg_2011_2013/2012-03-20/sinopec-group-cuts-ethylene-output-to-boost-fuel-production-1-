China Petrochemical Corp. (1314) , the
nation’s largest oil refiner, is cutting ethylene output this
month and boosting fuel production to meet rising demand in the
planting season.  Five refining units, including Maoming, Yanshan and
Zhongyuan, will reduce March ethylene production by a total
30,000 metric tons versus an earlier plan and increase oil-
product output by 100,000 tons, the company known as Sinopec
Group said in a  statement  on its website today. The measures may
continue in April if there is a need from the market, it said.  The state oil refiner, parent of  Hong Kong  listed  China
Petroleum & Chemical Corp (600028) , or Sinopec, is boosting gasoline and
diesel output as the central government increases oil-product
prices as much as 7.8 percent starting today. The economic
planner said yesterday that the tariff adjustment is aimed to
ensure domestic fuel supplies amid the planting season.  The measures will help ensure stable fuel supply to the
market as some refining plants will conduct maintenance in March
and April, the Chinese  oil company  said. Sinopec Group will
continue maintain “high refinery run rates”, according to the
company statement, which didn’t elabrate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
