Chinese equities traded in the U.S.
dropped to a two-week low, led by  E-House (EJ)  China Holdings Ltd.,
on concern slower growth in the world’s second-largest economy
is hurting corporate earnings.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S. dropped 1.1 percent to 103.47
yesterday in  New York , the weakest level since March 8.  China
Telecom Corp. (CHA)  plunged to a five-week low as profit missed the
average analyst estimate.  Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP)  led solar
companies higher after U.S. imposed lower-than-expected duties
on solar-equipment imports from China.  Property developer  China Real Estate Information Corp. (CRIC) ,
video sharing website Youku Inc. and insurance agency  CNinsure (CISG) 
Inc. all reported net losses for the last quarter of 2011 as the
economy recorded the slowest growth since mid-2009.  Europe ’s
debt crisis, a sluggish U.S. recovery and climbing  oil prices 
are crimping the outlook for  China , the world’s biggest exporter
and second-largest consumer of crude.  “Everybody starts to talk about a soft landing when a
really strong economy starts to slow down, and it may end up
being somewhat worse than that,”  Michael Shaoul , chairman of
New York-based Marketfield Asset Management, which manages $1.5
billion of assets and holds short positions in Chinese shares
betting on their decline, said by phone yesterday. “Europe’s
problem allowed people to ignore the deterioration in the
emerging markets story.”  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., slid 1.8 percent in its third
day of declines to $37.27, the lowest level since Jan. 13. The
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  fell 0.3 percent to 1,405.52, after
climbing the previous three days.  China Telecom Slumps  American depositary receipts of China Telecom, the nation’s
largest fixed-line carrier, declined 1.1 percent, extending a
three-day loss to $56.46, the lowest level since Feb. 14.  The company said yesterday on its website that profit
excluding gains from connection fees increased 11 percent to
2.84 billion yuan in the three months ended Dec. 31, from a
restated 2.55 billion yuan a year earlier. That compares with
the 3.15 billion-yuan average of five analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Shanghai-based E-House, a provider of property agency
services, plunged 6.2 percent to $5.92, the lowest level since
March 6.  China Real Estate Woes  New home prices fell in 27 of 70 Chinese cities last month
from a year earlier, while prices were unchanged in six others,
China’s statistics bureau said on March 18. That was the worst
performance since the government started releasing individual
data for 70 cities at the start of 2011.  China Real Estate, based in  Shanghai , sank 5.2 percent in
New York to $5.06 for a two-day loss of 9.3 percent.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell, snapping a two-day
advance, to lose 1.4 percent to 2,376.84 yesterday. The  Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies traded in Hong
Kong declined 1.5 percent to a two-month low of 10,870.61. The
gauge has retreated five days in a row, the longest losing
streak since Dec. 15.  Suntech, the world’s largest solar-panel maker, surged 14
percent to $3.57, the biggest one-day gain in two months.  Yingli
Green Energy Holding Co. (YGE) , a solar-panel marker based in Baoding
in China’s northern Hebei province, soared 12 percent to a four-
week high of $4.27.  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL) , based in Changzhou in
China’s eastern Jiangsu province, advanced 7.9 percent to a one-
month high of $8.38.  Solar Tariffs  The U.S. government imposed preliminary duties of as much
as 4.73 percent on solar-energy equipment imported a China, a
Commerce Department statement yesterday showed. Suntech was told
to pay a 2.9 percent tariff and Trina will pay 4.73 percent,
while the rate is 3.61 percent for other Chinese manufacturers,
according to the statement.  Maxim Group LLC analyst Aaron Chew said the tariff levels
were much lower than expected as some people had predicted
duties of as much as 10 percent.  Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. , the nation’s biggest producer
of the lightweight metal, sank for the third day in a row,
sliding 3.4 percent to $12.12, the weakest level since Jan. 30.  The company, known as Chalco, said on March 19 that it may
be unprofitable in the first quarter this year following a loss
in the second half of 2011.  Chalco’s net loss was 174.6 million yuan ($28 million) in
the six months ended Dec. 31, compared with profit of 247.4
million yuan a year earlier, according to calculations by
Bloomberg based on Chalco’s full-year earnings released last
week. The loss was wider than the 43.6 million-yuan median
estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Chalco Discount  Chalco’s ADRs, each representing 25 common shares in the
company, traded 0.7 percent  below  its  Hong Kong  stock, from a
premium a day earlier. The  shares  retreated 2.6 percent in Hong
Kong to HK$3.79 yesterday, the equivalent of 49 U.S. cents per
share. Chalco’s Shanghai-traded stock fell 2.5 percent to 6.9
yuan, or $1.09 per share.  E-Commerce China Dangdang Inc. (DANG) , known as Dangdang, slid for
a second day and lost 4.7 percent to $7.03, the biggest daily
drop in two weeks. Dangdang has posted three straight quarters
of  losses  because of price cuts and promotions to lure users
from websites including 360Buy.com and Alibaba Group Holding
Ltd.’s Tmall.com.  There will be mergers and acquisitions in the nation’s
online retail market this year as operators face difficulty
obtaining funds, Dangdang’s Chief Financial Officer Conor Yang
said in an interview in Hong Kong yesterday.  Youku (YOKU) , based in Beijing, fell for a sixth day and slid 3.9
percent to a one-week low of $25.07. Guangzhou-based CNinsure
declined 2 percent to $6.81 in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
