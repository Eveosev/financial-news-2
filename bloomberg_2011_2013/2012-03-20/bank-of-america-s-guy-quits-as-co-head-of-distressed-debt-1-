Michael Guy resigned as  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) ’s co-head of distressed sales and trading for
Europe, the  Middle East  and Africa after three years in the job.  Guy, who was based in the London office, said in a phone
interview that while he’s not retiring, he has “no intention of
taking a role in another investment bank.”  Alex Parry, a spokeswoman for  Bank of America  in London,
declined to comment.  Guy, 45, started his career in 1989 trading high-yield and
convertible bonds in New York at JPMorgan Chase & Co. He joined
the London office of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in 1998, two
years before the firm was bought by Credit Suisse Group AG.  At DLJ, Guy worked with high-yield market veteran Bennett Goodman, now senior managing director and co-founder of New
York-based GSO Capital Partners LP, the credit-investment unit
of  Blackstone Group LP. (BX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
