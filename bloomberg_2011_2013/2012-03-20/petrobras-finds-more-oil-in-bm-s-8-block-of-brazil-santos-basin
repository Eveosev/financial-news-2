Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) ,  Brazil ’s
state-controlled oil company, said it discovered “good
quality” oil at a well in the  Santos Basin , where 39 percent of
the country’s offshore discoveries have been made this year.  The find at the Caracara well, officially called BM-S-8, is
located 232 kilometers (144 miles) off the coast of Sao Paulo
state, the Rio de Janeiro-based company said today in a
statement. Santos holds Lula, Brazil’s largest oil field.  The basin is part of the so-called pre-salt region, named
after the layer of salt under which at least 50 billion barrels
of oil are trapped. Drilling is continuing at Carcara to
identify the bottom of the well, according to Petrobras.  Petrobras controls 66 percent of the block holding
Caracara, while Portgual’s  Galp Energia SGPS SA (GALP)  owns 14 percent
and Barra Energia do Brasil Petroleo & Bas Ltda. and  Queiroz
Galvao Exploracao & Producao SA (QGEP3)  each hold 10 percent.  The well is 5,750 meters (18,866 feet) deep and holds
“good quality” oil, according to a separate statement by Galp,
which also holds stakes in three other blocks in Santos. The
discovery hasn’t yet been declared commercially viable,
according to a posting on the website of Brazil’s National
Petroleum Agency.  There have been 18 off-shore oil and gas discoveries so far
this year in Brazil, 7 of which where in Santos,  according  to
the ANP website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
