The U.S.  Postal Service  aims to
better direct advertising mail from dentists, pizza parlors and
real estate brokers to prospective customers to help stem
anticipated annual losses of as much as $18.2 billion by 2015.  The Postal Service today said it will make permanent a
year-old project that lets small businesses micro-target areas
without having to address each piece of mail.  The effort will generate $1 billion in revenue by 2016,
Paul Vogel, chief marketing officer of the Washington-based
service, said at a press conference. This year, the service
anticipates $750 million to $800 million in revenue, he said.  “It has to be affordable,” Vogel said. “It has to
demonstrate a return on investment.”  The Postal Service reported $65.7 billion in revenue in the
fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, a 2 percent decline from the
previous period.  The service predicts an annual loss of $18.2 billion by
2015 and is shutting as many as 4,800 post offices, cutting as
many as 220,000 jobs and seeking congressional approval to end
Saturday mail delivery as part of its cost-cutting plans.  The new mailing service, called Every Door Direct, is being
marketed to the 54 percent of small businesses that advertise
and don’t use direct mail, Vogel said.  Customers pay 14.5 cents to mail a piece in the program and
don’t have to get a permit to send bulk mail, Vogel said. The
service allows as many as 5,000 pieces to be sent a day. That
price compares with 45 cents for a First Class stamp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
