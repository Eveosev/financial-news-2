The  Swiss Financial Market
Supervisory Authority , or Finma, should step up monitoring
internal deals between subsidiaries of insurance companies, the
 International Monetary Fund  said.  “Given the relatively high level of intra-group balances
in insurance companies, the current monitoring of intra-group
transactions by Finma is welcome, but needs to be strengthened
to contain contagion risk,” the Washington-based IMF said in an
 assessment of the economy  published on the Swiss government’s
website today.  An insurance group is made up of at least two legal
entities bound by some type of ownership arrangement, whereby at
least one of the entities runs insurance operations, according
to Finma.  The Swiss solvency test, introduced in January last year,
requires insurers to provide a mark-to-market valuation of
assets and liabilities, including their investment portfolios.
It already examines the solvency requirement of subsidiaries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
