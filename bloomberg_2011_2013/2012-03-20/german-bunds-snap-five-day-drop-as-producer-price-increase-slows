German bonds rose for the first
time in six days as signs growth in  China  and  Europe  is slowing
spurred demand for the euro-area’s safest securities.  Ten-year bunds halted their longest run of losses since
November on speculation benchmark yields near the highest level
in three months attracted some investors. Portuguese bonds
advanced before a debt sale tomorrow. Spanish two-year notes
advanced for a fourth day after the nation’s borrowing costs
fell as it sold 5 billion euros ($6.6 billion) of bills.  “The main reason for the downbeat tone to sentiment was
renewed concerns over the growth outlook in China,” said  John Davies , a fixed-income strategist at WestLB AG in London. “The
bund yield dropped by as much as four basis points.”  Germany’s 10-year yield fell two basis point, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.04 percent at 4:28 p.m. in  London  after
rising to 2.07 percent on March 16, the highest since Dec. 13.
The 2 percent bond due January 2022 climbed 0.14, or 1.40 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 99.645.  China’s steel production is slowing, Jacques Nasser,
chairman of  BHP Billiton  Ltd., the world’s biggest mining
company, said today according to the Australian Financial
Review. Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  announced this month an
economic growth target of 7.5 percent for 2012, down from an
annual 8 percent over the past seven years.  ‘Support for Bunds’  “If someone like BHP Billiton says the golden age of  iron
ore  in China is over then people take that very seriously,”
said  Marc Ostwald , a fixed-income strategist at Monument
Securities Ltd. in London. “A lot of the support for bunds is
coming from the fact it looks like being an equities down day
and people just want to know where they go from here.”  German producer-price inflation slowed to 0.4 percent last
month from 0.6 percent in January, the German Federal Statistics
Office said today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey was for an increase of 0.5 percent.  Bunds also rallied as a technical indicator used by traders
showed the securities were poised to change direction. The 14-
day  relative-strength index  for 10-year yields climbed to 66
yesterday, the highest since November, approaching the level of
70 that signals they were set to fall.  Ten-year bund yields jumped 33 basis points to 2.07 percent
on March 16, from a four-month low of 1.74 percent on March 12.  Portuguese Notes  Portuguese bonds rose as the nation prepared to hold its
first debt sale since Feb. 15. The country will auction bills
maturing in 119 and 364 days tomorrow.  The yield on  Portugal ’s two-year note slid 32 basis points
to 12.09 percent. That’s down 85 basis points from March 14,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Spain  sold 3.6 billion euros of 12-month bills at an
average yield of 1.418 percent, down from 1.899 percent at the
prior auction of the maturity on Feb. 14. The country also sold
1.45 billion euros of 18-month bills.  Spanish two-year note yields dropped three basis points to
2.34 percent.  The European Financial Stability Facility intends to sell 4
billion euros of five-year bonds that may be priced at a yield
in the low to mid-40 basis-point area more than the benchmark
swap rate, according to a banker involved in the transaction.  Germany  plans to sell an additional 5 billion euros of two-
year notes tomorrow.  German 10-year bund futures may drop to a three-month low
should they fail to climb above a key resistance level, UBS AG
said, citing trading patterns.  Bund futures “are bearish while they trade below 136.72,”
and may decline to 133.50,  Richard Adcock , head of fixed-income
technical strategy at UBS in London, wrote in a research note. A
resistance level refers to an area on a graph where technical
analysts anticipate sell orders to be clustered.  The bund contract expiring in June gained 0.2 percent to
135.67. The so-called leading contract last fell to as low as
133.50 on Nov. 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  German bunds have declined 1.3 percent this year, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish bonds advanced 2 percent,
the data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
