Gulf Coast gasoline strengthened as
 ConocoPhillips (COP)  said it plans to shut a fluid catalytic cracker
for maintenance at its Borger, Texas, refinery.  The 146,000-barrel-a-day plant expects to restart the unit
tomorrow after repairing a leak on a catalyst transfer line,
according to a filing with the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality.  Reformulated 87-octane gasoline, or RBOB, in the  Gulf Coast (MOSGR87P) 
strengthened 1.15 cents versus futures traded on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , moving to a premium of 0.75 cent a gallon
at 12:06 p.m. from a discount yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose 0.8 cent to $3.3718
a gallon.  Alon USA Energy Inc. (ALJ)  reported emissions at its Big Spring,
Texas, refinery yesterday after an upset in a fuel gas treater,
according to a filing with state regulators.  The discount to futures for the same fuel in  New York
Harbor (MOSN87PM)  narrowed 3 cents to 16.13 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
