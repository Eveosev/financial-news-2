Nissan Motor Co. (7201) ,  Japan ’s second-
biggest automaker, will revive its Datsun brand after three
decades in a bid to increase sales in  emerging markets  such as
Russia,  India (INVSDPAS)  and Indonesia.  Nissan will add two Datsun models every year in each of
those markets helping the brand account for as much as half the
company’s sales in India, Indonesia and Russia by March 2017,
the Yokohama, Japan-based carmaker said in a statement today.
The Datsun brand was officially discontinued in 1981,
Christopher Keeffe, a spokesman for the company, said yesterday.  The carmaker, which gets about 33 percent of its revenue
from  North America  and 21 percent from Japan, will start selling
the Datsun cars in the three emerging markets from 2014, Nissan
said. The brand, its third, will help the company compete
against companies such as  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL)  in India and
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  in Indonesia, according to Ammar Master, an
analyst at LMC Automotive in Bangkok.  “Datsun could bring in volumes at the lower end of the
market,” said Master. “While the Nissan brand will continue to
move upmarket.”  In India, Nissan sells its  Micra  compact hatchback from
421,765 rupees ($8,330).  Nissan shares fell 2.5 percent to 869 yen as of 1:35 p.m.
in Tokyo trading, while the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average
declined 0.6 percent.  Low-End Competition  Maruti Suzuki, India’s biggest automaker, derives the
majority of its sales from the mini-car segment that includes
cars with 1 liter engines and less than 3.6 meters long. The
New-Delhi based unit of  Suzuki Motor Corp. (7269)  offers its best-
selling Alto model from 240,352 rupees. In October,  Hyundai
Motor Co. (005380)  added its cheapest model, the Eon, priced from 269,999
rupees, to compete with Maruti in this segment.  Compacts and mini-cars accounted for more than 75 percent
of total passenger-car sales in the nation in the eleven months
ended February, according to data released by the  Society of
Indian Automobile Manufacturers . Maruti had 42 percent of the
total Indian passenger-car market while Hyundai had 19 percent
and Nissan 1.5 percent, according to data from the group.  Vehicle sales in Indonesia are projected to rise more than
50 percent in five years as the growing working class demands
minivans and compact cars. Nissan expects industrywide sales to
double in  Indonesia  by 2017, it said.  CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets estimates Indonesia had 32
vehicles for every 1,000 people in 2010, compared with 123 in
Thailand and 300 in Malaysia. Indonesia’s economy and population
are bigger than those two Southeast Asian neighbors combined.  To contact the reporters on this story:
