Former Jacksonville Jaguars
quarterback David Garrard signed with the  Miami Dolphins , who
missed out on free agents Peyton Manning and Matt Flynn.  Garrard, who was out of the National Football League in
2011 after being cut by the Jaguars, said last night on his
 Twitter page  he “couldn’t be happier” about his new team.  Garrard, 34, may compete with Matt Moore for the starting
quarterback job in Miami next season. The Dolphins had Manning,
Flynn and Alex Smith in for visits, though Manning is headed for
the Denver Broncos, ESPN reported, and Flynn signed with the
 Seattle Seahawks . The Dolphins may still consider signing Smith,
who spent the past six NFL seasons with the  San Francisco 49ers ,
the  Associated Press  said.  In nine seasons in Jacksonville, Garrard passed for 16,003
yards, with 89 touchdowns and 54 interceptions. He was the
Jaguars’ starter from 2005-10 and was released five days before
the first game of the 2011 regular season.  The Dolphins reached out to Garrard when Chad Henne
suffered a season-ending shoulder injury, but Garrard underwent
back surgery in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
