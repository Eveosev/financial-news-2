Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (1688)  is
considering completing a $3 billion loan without marketing it to
other lenders in general syndication, according to a person
familiar with the matter.  The company may close the loan just among senior-level
banks after receiving strong initial interest in the deal, the
person said, asking not to be identified because the details are
private.  A bank meeting to discuss the facility with those
interested in joining in so-called senior syndication was
attended by some 96 people, the person said. Alibaba invited
about 18 banks to join in the senior phase earlier this month,
offering to pay a blended all-in rate of 525 basis points to 600
basis points over the London interbank offered rate.  Nearly all
of the banks invited attended, the person said.  The loan is being underwritten and arranged by  Australia &
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) , Credit Suisse Group AG, DBS Bank
Ltd., Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc and Mizuho Corporate
Bank Ltd.  Alibaba Group, run by billionaire Jack Ma, offered HK$13.50
($1.74) a share for the 27 percent it doesn’t already own in
Alibaba.com, according to a Feb. 21 regulatory filing to the
Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Ma is seeking to buy out minority
Alibaba.com shareholders four years after a $1.7 billion initial
public offering as the unit warned of slowing earnings growth
tied to a change in strategy.  John Spelich, a Hong Kong-based spokesman at Alibaba,
wasn’t immediately available to comment on the syndication
strategy when contacted on his mobile telephone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
