Jerry Sandusky, the ex-Pennsylvania
State University coach accused of sexual abuse, won a court
request for psychological records of his alleged victims.  Prosecutors must deliver the records under seal to
Sandusky’s lawyer unless the state can establish that the
reports are privileged, state court Judge John M. Cleland said
in a ruling today.  “Other than reading the reports, counsel for the defendant
shall make no use of the information contained in the reports
without the prior authorization of the court,” Cleland said in
the ruling.  Sandusky, 68, a former assistant football coach, is charged
with more than 50 counts stemming from the alleged abuse of boys
over a 15-year period. He had asked for a court order requiring
prosecutors to disclose medical evaluations of the alleged
victims, court judgments involving drug or alcohol abuse and
transcripts of grand jury proceedings.  Cleland ordered the state to disclose records of juvenile
court judgments of any witness prosecutors intend to call to
testify. The state isn’t required to include drug or alcohol
violations in its disclosure, Cleland said.  Sandusky is scheduled to go on trial May 14.  The Sandusky case is Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v.
