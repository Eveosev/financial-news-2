The  Memphis Grizzlies  signed three-
time All-Star guard  Gilbert Arenas , the National Basketball
Association team said in a statement.  Arenas, 30, played 70 games last season with the
Washington Wizards and the Orlando Magic, averaging 10.8 points
and 3.9 assists. An All-Star in 2005, 2006 and 2007, he has
scored 11,330 points in his 10-year career.  In January 2010, Arenas was suspended by the NBA for the
remainder of the season after he pleaded guilty to gun charges
involving a locker-room incident with Wizards teammate Javaris
Crittenton.  Arenas was waived by Orlando in December.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
