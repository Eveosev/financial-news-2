Spain  sold 5.04 billion euros ($6
billion) of bills at the lowest rates in almost two years as
European Central Bank lending boosted demand.  Spain sold 3.6 billion euros of 12-month bills at 1.418
percent, the lowest since April 2010, and down from 1.899
percent at the last auction on Feb. 14, the Bank of Spain said
in Madrid today. Spain also sold 1.4 billion euros of 18-month
bills at 1.711 percent, down from 2.308 percent previously.  The ECB has loaned euro-area banks more than 1 trillion
euros for three years since December, boosting demand for
 government securities . Spain’s 10-year bond yield has remained
at about 5.2 percent, near the level when the operations began
on Dec. 20, after it failed to meet its budget-deficit goal and
public debt surged.  Spain sold 5.04 billion euros of both bills, less than the
5.5 billion-euro maximum target, and demand for the one year
notes declined. Investors ordered 2.14 times the amount of the
securities sold, compared with 2.27 times last month. Demand for
the 18-month bills was 2.93 times, compared to 2.88 times on
Feb. 14.  Spain’s  10-year benchmark bond  yield rose 1 basis point to
5.209 basis points 11:10 a.m.  Madrid  time. The yield was 5.188
before the sale. The yield spread over similar-maturity German
bunds widened 2 basis points to 317 points.  ECB Lending  Spanish banks’ average borrowings from the ECB last month
surged to a record of 152 billion euros, three times as much as
they were taking a year ago, after increasing their holdings of
the nation’s bonds to 202 billion euros in December, from 178
billion euros in November, Treasury data show.  Yields fell for both securities even as the nation’s
overall debt last year overshot the government’s forecast of
67.3 percent of gross domestic product, surging to 68.5 percent,
the most in more than two decades, from 61 percent in 2010.  The European Commission forecasts that Spain’s debt will
have almost doubled to 78 percent of GDP by next year from where
it was when  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis began, as the
country’s deficit-reduction efforts are hobbled by a relapse
into recession. The  International Monetary Fund  expects the
economy to contract 1.7 percent this year.  Euro-area finance chiefs agreed on March 12 that Spain’s
deficit goal for 2012 was unachievable after the shortfall came
in at 8.5 percent of GDP last year, compared with a 6 percent
target. For 2012, ministers agreed to ease the goal to 5.3
percent from an initial 4.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
