First City Monument Bank Plc (FCMB) , a
Nigerian lender, said it is aiming for a full-year profit of 19
billion naira ($120 million) in 2012.  “We are targeting 141 billion naira for full-year revenue
and full-year earnings per share of 1.10 naira,” the Lagos-
based lender, also known as FCMB, said today in an e-mailed
statement.  FCMB, which last year acquired  Finbank Plc (FIRSTINL) , a lender bailed
out by the central bank in 2009, plans to complete the
integration of the two banks by June, “with Finbank expected to
add 10 percent to FCMB’s overall profitability,” Chief
Executive Officer Ladi Balogun said on a conference call from
Lagos. The bank, with the merger, is forecast “to generate a
return on equity of 14 percent,” he said.  FCMB posted a full-year loss of 9.9 billion naira in 2011,
compared with a profit of 7.9 billion naira a year earlier, as
it made a provision of 29 billion naira for bad loans, it said
yesterday in an e-mailed statement. Revenue rose 28 percent to
80.4 billion naira.  The stock gained 4.6 percent to 3.87 naira today by the
close in Lagos, the biggest rise in six weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
