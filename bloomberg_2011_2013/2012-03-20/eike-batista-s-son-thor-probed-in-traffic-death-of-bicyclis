Thor Batista, the son and heir
apparent of Brazil’s richest man, is being investigated for
possible manslaughter after he ran over a cyclist on a highway
outside  Rio de Janeiro  on the evening of March 17, the city’s
police said.  Thor, 20, son of billionaire  Eike Batista , hit a 30-year-
old man as he drove a Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren sports car on
Washington Luiz highway, about 45 kilometers (27.9 miles) from
Rio, Rio police said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The
accident led to the death of Wanderson Pereira, police said.  Batista, who has another, younger son, defended his eldest
in messages posted on Twitter. He said Thor’s behavior was
“exemplary,” and that he wasn’t reckless.  EBX Group Co., the holding company for most of Batista’s
assets, said on March 18 that Thor was “deeply sorry” for the
accident and that the victim was crossing the road when he got
hit, according to an e-mailed statement.  The billionaire has been taking Thor to public events and
introducing him to investors as his likely successor. Batista,
who has a net worth of $28 billion, according to Bloomberg
Billionaires Index, built an empire of interlinked commodities
and logistics companies with assets in  Brazil ,  Colombia  and
 Chile .  Thor, the victim’s wife and a witness are scheduled to
testify on March 21, the police said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
