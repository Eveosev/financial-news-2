The  Madrid  region’s 2011 deficit
will be larger than first forecast because income fell by 1
billion euros ($1.3 billion) as a result of the economic crisis,
 Expansion  reported, citing Percival Manglano, an economic
adviser of the regional government.  Madrid was expected to end the year with a 1.13 percent
deficit, which would have made it the only Spanish region to
meet the target of less than 1.3 percent set by the European
Union; the actual figure will be greater, the newspaper said.  Manglano said he’d be surprised if other regions hadn’t
also suffered revenue declines, Expansion reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
