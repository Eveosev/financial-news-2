Refineria la Pampilla SA fell the
most among stocks in  Peru ’s benchmark index after the Repsol  YPF
SA (YPFD)  unit said a rule limiting sulfur levels in diesel will cost
its refinery $16 million over the next 12 months.  Relapasa, as the company is known, slumped 4.6 percent, the
most in a month, to 1.04 soles at 11:11 a.m. Lima time. The Lima
General Index declined 0.7 percent.  Relapasa will process less crude oil after a March 18
energy ministry ruling banned production of diesel with over 50
million parts per million of sulfur, according to a company
statement on the securities regulator’s website.  Oil for April delivery fell $1.91, or 1.8 percent, to
$106.18 a barrel at 11:47 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
