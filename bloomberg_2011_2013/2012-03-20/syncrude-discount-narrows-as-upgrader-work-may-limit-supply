Syncrude’s discount to benchmark
West Texas Intermediate narrowed to the smallest margin in two
weeks as upgrader maintenance may limit supplies.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  began shutting an upgrader at its oil-
sands plant in  Alberta  for three to five weeks for unplanned
maintenance earlier this month. Output from the Fort McMurray,
Alberta, facility will be reduced to about 140,000 barrels a
day. The oil-sands plant had average output of 361,000 barrels a
day in February, according to a posting on the Calgary-based
company’s website.  Syncrude (USCSSYNS) ’s discount to U.S. benchmark West Texas
Intermediate narrowed $1.50 to $9 a barrel at 2:06 p.m. in  New
York , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the smallest
gap since March 6.  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS) ’s discount narrowed $1 to $28 a
barrel. Bakken gained $2 to $12.50 under WTI.  In the U.S. Gulf Coast,  Light Louisiana Sweet’s (USCSLLSS)  premium to
WTI narrowed by 5 cents to $22.35 a barrel.  Heavy Louisiana
Sweet (USCSHLSE)  added 50 cents to a premium of $22.50.  Thunder Horse ’s premium to WTI widened by 20 cents to
$19.65 and  Mars Blend (USCSMARS)  added 15 cents to a premium of $14.50.
Poseidon’s premium increased 70 cents to $14. Southern Green
Canyon’s premium narrowed 20 cents to $14.50 over WTI.  West Texas Sour (USCSWTSM) ’s discount widened 30 cents to $5.60 a
