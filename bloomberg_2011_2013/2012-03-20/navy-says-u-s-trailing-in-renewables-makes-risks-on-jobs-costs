(Corrects amount spent on fuel in third paragraph of story
published March 20.)  U.S. Navy Secretary Ray Mabus said
he’s working to boost the use of biofuels and other forms of
renewable energy by the armed forces because falling behind on
the technology raises security risks for the nation.  “The risk is that other countries get ahead in those
technologies, and they’re producing the jobs and not us,” Mabus
said at the Bloomberg New Energy Finance conference in  New York 
today. “I don’t want to trade oil from overseas for biofuels
from overseas. I don’t want to fall behind.”  The Navy spends $4.5 billion a year on fuel and is
considering ways to use renewables as an alternative to oil.
Each $1 increase in the cost of a barrel adds $31 million to the
Navy’s energy bill, he said. The Navy will use a 50 percent
blend of biofuels at war games near  Hawaii  in July, Mabus said.  “We’re absolutely confident that if we bring a market
here, biofuel costs will come down and become competitive with
fossil fuels,” Mabus said.  The U.S. imports about half its oil from overseas,
according to the Energy Information Agency.  “We’re trying to drive down our exposure to energy-price
fluctuations,” Mabus said. “We’re only doing this to be better
war fighters.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
