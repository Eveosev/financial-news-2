More than two-thirds of the 100
largest U.S. metropolitan areas grew more slowly over the last
decade than during the 1990s, largely because of the slumping
economy, a study released today said.  The  Brookings Institution ’s Metropolitan Policy Program
found the slowdown most pronounced in Southern and Western metro
areas, especially in the suburbs of cities such as Denver,
Atlanta, Miami,  Salt Lake City  and  Las Vegas .  The slower growth affects the 65 percent of the U.S.
population that lives in a metro area with more than 500,000
people. More than 80 percent of Americans live in metropolitan
areas, with 45 percent living in suburbs.  “As U.S. job and housing markets stabilize and expand once
again, population will likely return to interior Sun Belt
metropolitan areas and suburban communities,” William H. Frey,
a senior Brookings fellow, wrote in a summary of the study,
which was based on U.S. census data. “However, the places that
succeed in this new regime will probably not mirror the winners
at either the middle or the end of the turbulent 2000s.”  Instead, he said, areas with “knowledge-based economies”
-- possibly including Austin,  Texas , and Raleigh, North Carolina
-- are likely to draw the most people over the long run.  Winners and Losers  Frey said the dot-com bust, Sept. 11 attacks, hurricanes
Katrina and Rita, and the worst  economic downturn  since the
Great Depression conspired to slow growth. During the 1980s, the
U.S. population increased by 9.8 percent. It rose by 13.2
percent in the 1990s before falling back to 9.7 percent growth
from 2000 to 2010.  Growth slowed especially over the latter part of the last
decade, with 63 metro areas growing more slowly after 2007 than
during the middle of the 2000s. Las Vegas, Phoenix, Boise,
Idaho, and Orlando, Cape Coral and Lakeland,  Florida , were among
the hardest-hit places, the study said. The housing market
collapse triggered the sharpest declines in Hispanic growth in
 Charlotte ,  North Carolina , and Raleigh, Atlanta, Provo,  Utah ,
and Las Vegas.  Las Vegas’s population grew 60.1 percent in the 1980s,
third-fastest among U.S. metro areas. It grew 85.5 percent
during the 1990s and 41.8 percent during the 2000s, both the
highest rate among metro areas during those decades.  Frey said areas such as Austin and Raleigh, “with
diversified, knowledge-based economies are likely to fare best
in the long run, though predicting which areas these will be is
hardly an exact science.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
