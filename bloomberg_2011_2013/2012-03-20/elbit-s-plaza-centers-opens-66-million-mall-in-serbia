Plaza Centers NV (PLAZ) , an Israeli
property developer focused on eastern Europe, is opening its
first Serbian commercial space today in a city where  Fiat SpA (F) 
helped revive the local  auto industry .  The 60,000-square-meter (642,000 square-foot)  shopping mall 
in  Kragujevac  cost more than 50 million euros ($66 million)
since construction began in 2008, said Sagiv Meger, Plaza’s
director for Serbia. Amsterdam-based  Plaza  has another three
projects in the Balkan country.  “Plaza Centers is focused on the whole of Serbia, we are
looking for new lots in key cities,” Meger said in e-mailed
comments ahead of the opening in Kragujevac, 110 kilometers (70
miles) south of Belgrade. The mall is the city’s first modern
retail center, with more than 100 stores and a six-theater
cinema.  A subsidiary of  Elbit Imaging Ltd, (EMIT) , a member of  Europe
Israel (EURO)  Group controlled by Mordechay Zisser, Plaza plans a
70,000-square-meter mixed-use  complex  with hotel, retail and
office space in Belgrade, a 45,000-square-meter retail and
