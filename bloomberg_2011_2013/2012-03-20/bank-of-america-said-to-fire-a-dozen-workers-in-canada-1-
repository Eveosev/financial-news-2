Bank of America Corp.  has fired
almost a dozen workers at its Canadian capital markets business
as part of a global staff reduction, a person familiar with the
situation said.  The move leaves the bank with almost 500 people at offices
in Toronto,  Montreal , Vancouver and Calgary, said the person,
who declined to be identified because the company doesn’t
disclose this information publicly.  Sheryl King, the bank’s head economist for Canada, left the
firm as part of the cuts, Dow Jones reported. A call to her
work telephone extension was forwarded to a general company
directory and her mobile phone voicemail said she was
unavailable.  Chief Executive Officer Brian T. Moynihan is cutting jobs
this month as the second-largest U.S. lender seeks to reduce
costs throughout its operations. The Charlotte, North Carolina-
based bank recently dismissed Steven Milunovich and two other
energy analysts, said two people with knowledge of the moves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
