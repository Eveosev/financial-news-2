Poland , the largest eastern member
of the European Union, will remain a recipient of funds from the
European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development  in the coming
years, the bank’s President  Thomas Mirow  said.  “There’s still room for the EBRD to invest in Poland,”
Mirow told reporters in Warsaw today. “We continue to expect
Poland to graduate over time, but not in the immediate future.”  In 2007 the  Czech Republic  became the first, and so far the
only country, where the London-based development bank stopped
investing. The EBRD was created in 1991 to foster the building
of market economies in post-communist east Europe.  The investments will target the financial industry,
“especially with the aim of deepening the capital market,” and
the energy industry, he said.  The financial crisis that followed the collapse of  Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  uncovered fragilities in the region,
Mirow said.  “The situation in central Europe was more complex than had
been earlier expected,” he said. “The transition process the
EBRD was focusing on was less advanced than initially thought.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
