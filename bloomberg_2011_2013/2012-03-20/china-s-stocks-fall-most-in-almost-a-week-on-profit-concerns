China’s stocks  fell the most in
almost a week after the government raised fuel prices and
profits for state-owned companies dropped in the first two
months of this year.  SAIC Motor Corp. (600104)  and Chongqing Changan Automobile Co. led
declines for automakers after the government increased gasoline
prices and an industry group said China’s vehicle sales growth
may miss its forecast. Shipper China Cosco Holdings Co. and Air
China Ltd. declined 2.7 percent on concern slowing economic
growth will curb transport demand.  Shanghai Pudong Development
Bank (600000)  Co. fell to the lowest level in seven weeks after Citigroup
Inc. sold its entire stake in the lender.  “Higher energy costs and falling profits may worry
investors that the economy is slowing even further,” said Dai Ming, a  fund manager  at Shanghai Kingsun Investment Management &
Consulting Co.  The Shanghai Composite Index lost 33.35 points, or 1.4
percent, to 2,376.84 at the close. The CSI 300 Index declined
1.7 percent to 2,584.45. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the
measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies,
retreated 0.2 percent in  New York  yesterday.  Thirty-day  volatility  in the Shanghai Composite was at
14.91, the lowest in a week. About 14.5 billion shares changed
hands in the measure yesterday, or 15 percent higher than the
daily average this year.  The Shanghai Composite has advanced 8.1 percent this year
on expectations the central bank will add to a Feb. 18 cut in
the reserve requirement ratio. Stocks in the index trade at 9.8
times estimated profit, compared with a record low of 8.9 times
on Jan. 6, weekly data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Transport Stocks  Profits for China’s state-owned companies fell 11 percent
in the first two months this year, according to a statement
posted on the finance ministry’s website. Revenue increased 9.9
percent, the statement said.  China Cosco retreated 2.7 percent to 5.14 yuan. Cosco
Shipping Co., a unit of China’s biggest shipping company, slid
3.5 percent to 4.67 yuan.  Air China Ltd. (601111) , the nation’s largest
international carrier, lost 2.7 percent to 6.54 yuan.  China
Eastern Airlines Corp. (600115) , the second-biggest carrier, fell 3
percent to 3.93 yuan. Emerging market and Asian transport stocks
were cut to underweight yesterday at Morgan Stanley because of
rising oil prices.  China, the world’s largest oil consumer after the U.S.,
increased gasoline and diesel prices after crude had its biggest
monthly gain in a year. Brent oil rose 11 percent in February,
the biggest monthly gain since February 2011.  Fuel Prices  Prices gained by 600 yuan ($95) a metric ton starting
today, after the three crude grades tracked by the National
Development and Reform Commission climbed more than 10 percent,
according to a statement on the planning agency’s website
yesterday evening. Retail gasoline prices will increase as much
as 6.6 percent and diesel will be as much as 7.2 percent more
expensive, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) ,  Asia ’s biggest oil
refiner, fell 0.5 percent to 7.60 yuan. PetroChina Co., the
nation’s second-biggest refiner, slipped 0.5 percent to 10.21
yuan. Chinese refiners are unlikely to break even because of
higher feedstock costs from the “current oil price
environment,”  Barclays Capital  said in a report.  SAIC Motor dropped 3.8 percent to 14.35 yuan. Chongqing
Changan Automobile Co., the Chinese partner of Ford Motor Co.
and Mazda Motor Corp., lost 3.9 percent to 4.45 yuan.  Anhui
Jianghuai Automobile Co. (600418) , a unit of China’s biggest light-truck
exporter, fell 1.6 percent to 6.96 yuan.  Total vehicle deliveries -- forecast by the China
Association of Automobile Manufacturers to grow 8 percent this
year -- may fail to increase by even 5 percent because of the
“difficult” economic backdrop, Gu Xianghua, one of two
deputies to the secretary general at CAAM, said at a conference
in Qingdao today, citing his personal opinion. Demand for
commercial automobiles would be hit the hardest, Gu said.  Economic Slowdown  BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s biggest mining company, said
 China ’s steel production is slowing as the world’s fastest-
growing major economy starts to shift to focus more on consumers
than large building projects.  Pudong Bank lost 1.7 percent to 9.12 yuan, the lowest close
since Feb. 1. Citigroup sold its 2.71 percent holding through
block trades to institutional investors for a total of $668
million, the New York-based lender said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday. The shares were sold at 8.33 yuan apiece, or about 10
percent less than Pudong Bank’s closing price yesterday.  Brokerages Drop  Citic Securities Co. paced declines for brokerages, sliding
4.1 percent to 11.75 yuan. GF Securities Co. slid 3.7 percent to
28.60 yuan. Haitong Securities Co. lost 4.6 percent to 9.14
yuan.  Chinese property stocks listed in the U.S. slipped, led by
 China Real Estate Information Corp. (CRIC) , as  home prices  in the
world’s second-largest economy posted the worst month in at
least a year.  “Property stocks may rebound in a longer run” as the data
indicates that the government’s efforts to control price gains
has been successful, said Jeff Papp, a senior analyst at
Oberweis Asset Management Inc., which manages $700 million
including Chinese stocks.  Premier  Wen Jiabao  signaled last week that China won’t
relax property curbs aimed at controlling price increases, even
as economic growth slowed to the least in 10 quarters in the
last three months of 2011 and the government’s growth target has
been cut for this year.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Richard Frost  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
