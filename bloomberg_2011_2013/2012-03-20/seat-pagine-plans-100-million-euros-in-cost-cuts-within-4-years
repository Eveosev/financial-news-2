Seat Pagine Gialle SpA (PG) ,  Italy ’s
largest phone-book publisher, plans cost cuts of about 100
million euros ($132 million) over the next three to four years,
Chief Executive Officer Alberto Cappellini said.  The savings will help the Turin-based company maintain its
Ebitda margin, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization as a percentage of sales, higher than 40
percent, the CEO said at a presentation in Milan today.  “We have a significant cost management program as the
company transitions from print to online offerings,” Cappellini
said.  Phone-book publishers in  Europe  including Seat Pagine are
beefing up their Internet offerings as users and advertisers
ditch printed directories. The company’s online revenue exceeded
print sales for the first time last year.  The stock rose as much as 14 percent to 5.97 euro cents,
and was up 8.8 percent at 3:36 p.m. in Milan. The stock surged
20 percent yesterday.  “There are no elements that can explain the share
movements,” CEO Cappellini said. Chief Financial Officer
Massimo Cristofori added that the stock is mainly held by retail
investors and therefore it “trades a lot on sentiment.”  The company has said it plans to generate 80 percent of
revenue from the Web in 2015 and is evaluating whether to
purchase Glamoo, a company it has a coupon partnership with.  Seat Pagine, whose bondholders agreed this month to a 1.28
billion-euro debt-for-equity swap proposal, plans to complete
its debt restructuring plan in October, Cappellini said in a
March 13 interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
