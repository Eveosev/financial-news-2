U.S. gasoline demand rose 3.4
percent last week even as demand slipped below year-earlier
levels for the 29th consecutive week,  MasterCard Inc. (MA)  said.  Drivers bought 8.78 million barrels a days of gasoline in
the seven days ended March 16, according to MasterCard’s
SpendingPulse report.  Purchases totaled 61.4 million barrels, exceeding 60
million for the first time in 12 weeks.  Gasoline demand year-to-date is 5.6 percent below a year
earlier. That’s the biggest decline for this time of the year in
MasterCard records, which go back to July 2004.  Last week’s demand also fell 5.6 percent below a year
earlier. Fuel use over the previous four weeks was 6.6 percent
below the same period in 2011, the 52nd consecutive decline in
that measure.  The average pump price rose 7 cents to $3.84 a gallon, the
highest price since May 20. Gasoline has jumped 15 percent this
year and 7.9 percent in the past year.  The highest prices are on the West Coast, where the average
was $4.22 a gallon. The lowest prices were in the Lower
Atlantic, where a gallon averaged $3.75.  The report from Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is
assembled by MasterCard Advisors, the company’s consulting arm.
The information is based on credit-card swipes and cash and
check payments at about 140,000 U.S. gasoline stations.  Visa Inc. (V)  is the biggest payments network company by
transactions processed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
