New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the Czech
Republic’s biggest producer of coking coal, headed for its
steepest four-day decline since November as signs the Chinese
economy is slowing drove investors from riskier assets.  NWR retreated 1.7 percent to 130.3 koruna by 1:32 p.m. in
Prague, extending losses in the past four days to 9.5 percent.  Stocks and commodities dropped worldwide after China, the
world’s biggest energy consumer and steelmaker, raised fuel
prices by the most in two years.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
biggest mining company, said China’s steel output is slowing and
the nation’s Association of Automobile Manufacturers said
