Indonesia â€™s Shariah-compliant
insurance assets increased by 32 percent to 9.2 trillion rupiah
($1 billion) in 2011 from a year earlier, according to data from
the  Capital Market and Financial Supervisory Agency .  Islamic insurance, or takaful, has grown by 50 percent on
average in the last five years, the agency said in an e-mailed
statement today. Takaful is based on the Koranic principle of
mutual support where policy holders contribute a sum of money to
a fund managed by the company for use in the event of a loss by
one of its members.  Malaysian insurers Mayban Ageas and Syarikat Takaful
Malaysia Bhd. plan to expand in Indonesia to take advantage of
the growth rate, the companies told Bloomberg this month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
