Hines Ward  announced his retirement
from the  National Football League  after winning two Super Bowl
titles and catching 1,000 passes during 14 seasons with the
Pittsburgh Steelers.  Ward, 35, is the Steelers’ career leader in receptions,
yards receiving (12,083) and touchdown catches (85). The team
this month released Ward, who is one of eight players in NFL
history with 1,000 receptions.  Ward said at a news conference that he doesn’t want to join
another team even though he thinks he still has the ability and
competitive drive to play. He said several other teams had
expressed an interest in him since free agency started, without
being specific.  “I don’t want to play in any other uniform,” Ward said
today in Pittsburgh. “The black and gold runs deep in me, and I
will remain a Steeler for life.”  Ward joins Hall of Fame receiver  Jerry Rice  as the only
players with 1,000 receptions and multiple Super Bowl titles.
He’s the third receiver in league history to accumulate 12,000
receiving yards while spending his entire career with the same
team, following Marvin Harrison of the  Indianapolis Colts  and
 Steve Largent  of the Seattle Seahawks.  “When I first came into this league I didn’t think I’d
have such a long and productive career,” said Ward, a four-time
Pro Bowl selection. “I’ve accomplished all that I’ve set out to
and more. I really have nothing left to prove.”  Ward was the Most Valuable Player of the 2006 Super Bowl,
in which he had 123 yards receiving and a touchdown to lead the
Steelers to a 21-10 victory over the  Seattle Seahawks . He also
played on the Pittsburgh team that won the 2009 Super Bowl.  Ward had 46 catches for 381 yards and two touchdowns last
season. All three totals were his fewest since becoming a
starter in 1999, a year after being drafted by the Steelers in
the third round out of the  University of Georgia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
