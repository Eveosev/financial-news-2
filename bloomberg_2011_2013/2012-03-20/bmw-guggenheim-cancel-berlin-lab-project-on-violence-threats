Threats by left-wing activists in
Berlin prompted  New York ’s Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation to
cancel a planned stop in the city’s Kreuzberg district for its
mobile laboratory, the  BMW Guggenheim Lab .  The project, sponsored by  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , was
scheduled to travel to nine cities worldwide over six years to
encourage debate and proposals for the future of urban life. It
was due to open in Berlin on May 24.  “This decision was made as a consequence of threats to the
project,” the BMW Guggenheim Lab said in a statement. Police
and local authorities said there was an elevated risk, it said.  Left-wing activists used the Internet to urge protesters to
“derail” the project, according to the daily Tagesspiegel
newspaper. Their protest was that the project would accelerate
the gentrification of Kreuzberg, leading to higher rents and new
luxury residential developments, the newspaper said.  The BMW Guggenheim Lab mobile project will now move
elsewhere, the release said, though it didn’t specify where.  To contact the reporter on the story:
