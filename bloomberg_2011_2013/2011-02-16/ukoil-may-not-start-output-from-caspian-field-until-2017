OAO Lukoil,  Russia ’s largest non-
state oil producer, said output from its main field in the
Caspian may not start until 2017 without tax assurances.  Production at the Filanovsky deposit could start as early
as 2014 if the government offers tax concessions, Lukoil said in
a presentation in Moscow today. Without a friendly tax regime,
output won’t begin until 2017, according to the company.  Lukoil aims to produce more than 200,000 barrels a day,
equal to about 2 percent of Russia’s current output, from
Filanovsky alone. Deputy Energy Minister Sergei Kudryashov
called the field the “pearl” of the Russian Caspian in April.  Oil output from the  Caspian Sea  is exempt from Russia’s
mineral extraction tax for 12 years or until output reaches 10
million tons. Crude from the Caspian also qualifies for a
discounted export duty, which is revisited on a monthly basis.  The Moscow-based company began production from Russia’s
sector of the Caspian in April at the Korchagin deposit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
