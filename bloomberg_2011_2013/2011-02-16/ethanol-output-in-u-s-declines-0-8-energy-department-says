U.S. ethanol production fell 0.8
percent to 893,000 barrels a day last week, according to the
Energy Department.  Stockpiles remained unchanged at 19.6 million barrels, the
department reported today in  Washington .  Production of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol
rose 0.1 percent to 4.66 million barrels a day. Refiners receive
a 45-cent tax credit for every gallon of ethanol blended into
the motor fuel.  Denatured ethanol for March delivery fell 1.9 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $2.425 a gallon at 11:10 a.m. New York time on the
Chicago Board of Trade.  Average ethanol mills in Iowa and  Illinois  are losing 9
cents and 6 cents, respectively, on every gallon produced on a
spot basis, according to Ag Trader Talk, an online grains
information service in Clive,  Iowa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
