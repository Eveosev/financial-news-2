Bank of Italy Governor  Mario Draghi 
is the favorite to replace  Jean-Claude Trichet  as president of
the  European Central Bank , according to Paddy Power Plc.  The Irish bookmaker offered odds of 4 to 9 on Draghi
succeeding Trichet, whose term ends in October. That means a
gambler betting 9 euros ($12) would win 4 euros and their stake
back if Draghi was picked by European leaders. Bank of Finland
Governor Erkki Liikanen was installed as second favorite with
odds of 2 to 1.  The race for the ECB presidency was thrown open last week
by the withdrawal of Bundesbank President  Axel Weber , who
economists had anointed the frontrunner. Draghi, chairman of the
Financial Stability Board, is the only declared candidate for
the job.  Weber’s departure “seems to clear the way for Mr. Draghi
to succeed Mr. Trichet,” Stephen Lewis, chief economist at
Monument Securities Ltd. in London, said in a note to clients
today.  Draghi, 63, is a former official in the Italian finance
ministry and the World Bank. Italy’s reputation for fiscal
imprudence and his three years at  Goldman Sachs Group Inc . may
count against him, as might the fact that another southern
European, Vitor Constancio of Portugal, is already vice
president at the ECB.  Paddy Power offered odds of 8 to 1 on central bankers Yves Mersch of Luxembourg and Nout Wellink of the Netherlands taking
over at the ECB. Klaus Regling, head of Europe’s bailout fund,
is a 20 to 1 outsider, the Dublin-based company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
