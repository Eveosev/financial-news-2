   Massmart Holdings Ltd . will
increase its purchases of South African-made goods after it has
sold a controlling stake to Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Business Day
said, citing Chief Executive Officer Grant Pattison.  The retailer aims to expand the number of its food stores
by about 40 to 300, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said. The
company is responding to labor union concerns that jobs will be
lost after the purchase is completed, Business Day said.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
