electricity from a proposed Turkish nuclear power plant for as
low as $0.1 per kilowatt-hour, Aksam newspaper reported.  Toshiba, backed by the Japanese government is prepared to
lower the price of the electricity depending on how large as
stake the Turkish state-run power company Euas takes in the
plant at Sinop on the Black Sea coast, Aksam said, without
