Real-estate investor  Sam Zell  may
buy a stake in Chicagoâ€™s 200 S. Wacker office building, the Wall
Street Journal reported, citing an unidentified person familiar
with the matter.    Behringer Harvard, which manages the real-estate investment
trust that owns the tower, declined to comment, the Journal
said. Behringer said last year it was seeking a partner to
invest more capital into the building.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
