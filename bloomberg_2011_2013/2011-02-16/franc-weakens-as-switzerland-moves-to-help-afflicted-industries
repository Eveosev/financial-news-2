The Swiss franc strengthened against
13 of its 16 most-traded counterparts, reversing an earlier
decline, after Israeli Foreign Minister  Avigdor Lieberman  said
two Iranian gunboats are planning to sail tonight to Syria.  The franc rose a third day versus the dollar after
Lieberman called the move a “provocation,” boosting demand for
the perceived safety of the franc. The currency earlier
fluctuated after Swiss National Bank President Philipp Hildebrand told L’Agefi newspaper that the strong franc is
helping to counter some inflationary tendencies, while the
economy ministry said it will take measures to help industries
hurt by the franc’s strength.  “There’s a pick-up in safe-haven demand for the Swiss
franc driven by concern of escalating tensions between Israel
and Iran,” said  Lee Hardman , a foreign-exchange strategist at
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in  London . “The initial
reaction is to buy the Swiss franc.”  The franc was 0.1 percent stronger at 1.3034 per euro as of
5:32 p.m. in London, and appreciated 0.7 percent to 96.08
centimes per dollar.  The currency earlier strengthened as Hildebrand told the
newspaper that the SNB won’t be able to maintain current
monetary policy should growth meet projections, signaling the
central bank may be preparing to raise  interest rates .  To contact the reporter on this story:
