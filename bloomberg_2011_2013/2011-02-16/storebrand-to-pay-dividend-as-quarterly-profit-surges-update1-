  Storebrand ASA ,  Norway ’s largest
publicly traded insurer, plans to make its first dividend
payment since 2008 after fourth-quarter profit rose 78 percent
on higher premium income.  Net income climbed to 955 million kroner ($165 million)
from 536 million kroner a year earlier, the Oslo-based company
said in a statement today. That beat the average 602 million-
krone estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Premium
income rose 2.9 percent to 5.46 billion kroner.  “Continued growth is expected in the life and pensions
market and wages growth will be the most important factor in the
short term,” the company said in a statement.  Storebrand plans to pay a dividend of 1.1 kroner a share,
it said.  The Norwegian company, which offers  life insurance , banking
services as well as property and casualty insurance, acquired
Sweden’s SPP from Svenska Handelsbanken AB in 2007 to become the
Nordic region’s biggest occupational-pensions group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
