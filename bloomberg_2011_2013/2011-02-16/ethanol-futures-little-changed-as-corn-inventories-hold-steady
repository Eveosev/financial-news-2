Ethanol futures were little changed
in  Chicago  as corn prices and U.S. inventories of the fuel
additive were steady.  The grain-based additive declined 0.2 percent after corn
pared early losses on speculation that rain may boost crops in
Brazil and  Argentina , the world’s biggest exporters after the
U.S. Ethanol stockpiles remained unchanged at 19.6 million
barrels, while production fell 0.8 percent to 893,000 barrels a
day last week, the Energy Department reported today.  “There’s been talk of a slowdown here in the last couple
of weeks and margins have been tight for the ethanol
producers,” said Matt Janney, a trader at Citigroup Global
Markets Inc. in Chicago. “Hopefully, there will be a pickup in
gasoline demand and there’s been a buildup of gasoline stocks
recently.”  Denatured ethanol for March delivery fell 0.4 cent to
$2.440 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. It has risen 42
percent this year.  Ethanol, made from corn in the U.S., is blended with
gasoline to stretch supply and meet federal mandates.  Production of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol
rose 0.1 percent to 4.66 million barrels a day. Refiners receive
a 45-cent tax credit for every gallon of ethanol blended into
the motor fuel.  Cash Market Trading  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. West Coast
gained 0.5 cent, or 0.2 percent, to $2.55 a gallon, and in
Chicago the additive increased by 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to
$2.43, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  gained 1 cent to $2.545 a gallon and on
the U.S. Gulf the biofuel was unchanged at $2.505.  Corn futures for May delivery were unchanged at $7.01 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. On Feb. 14, the price
touched $7.21, the highest since July 2008, after bad weather
reduced global production and as demand rose.  Average ethanol mills in Iowa and  Illinois  are losing 9
cents and 6 cents, respectively, on every gallon produced on a
spot basis, according to Ag Trader Talk, an online grains
information service in Clive,  Iowa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
