Electricite de France SA may propose
building a nuclear power plant rather than coal-fired units for
Elektrownia Kozienice, a unit of  Enea SA , Dziennik  reported ,
without citing anyone.  Enea, which EDF wants to buy from the Polish government, is
now seeking builders for a 1,000-megawatt power generation unit
in Kozienice and may build another, with the same capacity.  According to Dziennik, EDFâ€™s proposal to build a 1,600-
megawatt reactor would enable the Polish Treasury to expand the
Kozienice plant while avoiding the risk of investing in coal-
fired capacity, given uncertainty about the cost of carbon
emission rights.  To contact the reporter on this story:
