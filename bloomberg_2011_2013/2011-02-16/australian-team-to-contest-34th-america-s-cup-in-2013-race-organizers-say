An Australian team will challenge
for the 2013 America’s Cup after its entry was accepted by the
Golden Gate Yacht Club, race organizers said.  The team will battle for the Louis Vuitton Cup, whose
winner will face defending America’s Cup champion Oracle Racing
of the U.S. on  San Francisco Bay  in 2013.  “The Australian Team is progressing with intensive work on
all fronts: Crew selection is taking place, the technical
programme is underway and the formal structure, including legacy
provisions, is being cemented,” organizers said in a  statement 
on the America’s Cup website.  It’s Australia’s first entry in the race since 1999-2000.  Australia  II beat U.S. yacht Liberty in 1983 to end the New York
Yacht Club’s 132-year hold on the trophy.  Two teams from  France , a Swedish outfit and an Italian
entrant are the other Louis Vuitton Cup contenders announced so
far. Entries close March 31.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
