Ukraine’s  central bank  extended the
temporary management at lender VAT Nadra Bank until after a
capital increase of the bank can be completed.  Valentyna Zhukovska will continue as temporary manager
until no later than Aug. 12, the Kiev-based lender said in e-
mailed statement today. The Natsionalnyi Bank Ukrainy appointed
her in February 2009, initially for a year.  Nadra plans to increase its capital tenfold by selling
additional shares. Ukraine has to either make Nadra operational
or liquidate it to receive another loan from the  International
Monetary Fund .  To contact the reporter on this story:
