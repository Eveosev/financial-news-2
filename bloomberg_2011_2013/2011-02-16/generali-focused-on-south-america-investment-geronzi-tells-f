  Assicurazioni Generali SpA  is
focusing on investing in  South America  and may make acquisitions
as part of a plan to expand into growth markets where it has
little or no presence, the Financial Times reported, citing an
interview with Chairman Cesare Geronzi.  The company may consider investing in Italian banks seeking
to raise capital to meet Basel III requirements, however a
merger between Mediobanca SpA and Generali is “out of the
question,” Geronzi said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
