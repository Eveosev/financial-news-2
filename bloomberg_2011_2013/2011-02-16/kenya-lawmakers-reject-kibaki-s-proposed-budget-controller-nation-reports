Kenyan lawmakers rejected President  Mwai Kibaki ’s nomination of William Kirwa as the country’s new
budget controller as unconstitutional, the  Daily Nation 
reported, citing a report by a parliamentary committee.  Kibaki and Prime Minister Raila Odinga were urged by the
committee to find a suitable replacement candidate, the Nairobi-
based newspaper said. A separate panel will today deliver a
report on Kibaki’s nomination of three judicial officials, it
said.  Odinga has previously rejected all four nominations, saying
he wasn’t consulted by Kibaki on the appointments as required
under Kenyan law.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
