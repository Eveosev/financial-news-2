Finland’s former Prime Minister
Matti Vanhanen won’t be charged and tried in the High Court of
Impeachment, state-owned broadcaster YLE reported today, without
saying where it got the information.  Finland’s parliament’s constitutional committee was unanimous
in deciding not to prosecute Vanhanen for failing to excuse
himself from a meeting where the government decided to
distribute funds to an organization that had supported
Vanhanen’s 2006 presidential bid, YLE said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
