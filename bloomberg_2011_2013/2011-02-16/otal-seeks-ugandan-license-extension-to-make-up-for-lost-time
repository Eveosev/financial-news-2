  Total SA , France’s biggest explorer,
is seeking an extension to a Ugandan oil and gas license after a
tax dispute held up its progress.  Total and China National Offshore Oil Corp. are  Tullow Oil
Plc ’s partners in a plan to tap fields in the  Lake Albert basin .
Uganda has delayed final approval of the deal pending its claim
for capital gains tax from  Heritage Oil Plc , which was Tullow’s
former partner in the region.  Total wants to make sure that the partners have enough time
to develop the project and are granted additional time to make
up for the delay, Chief Executive Officer Christophe de Margerie
told reporters today in  London .  “We don’t think that the Total CEO’s comments should be
construed negatively,” said Phil Corbett, a London-based
analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. The license
extension would “allow the partners the chance to target the
upside potential.”  The partners are holding talks with the Ugandan government
about the development, which may pump more than 200,000 barrels
of oil a day in 2015, London-based Tullow said last month.  Tullow fell 1.3 percent at 1,409 pence in London.  To contact the reporters on this story:
