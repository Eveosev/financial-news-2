Cecilia Rouse, a member of President
Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, will leave the
administration next month to return to  Princeton University , the
White House said in a statement.  “Ceci has been one of the economic team’s central figures
on education, training, and labor issues,” CEA Chairman  Austan Goolsbee  said. “Our loss will be Princeton’s gain.”  Rouse, 47, was deputy chair of the CEA and focused on post-
secondary education, labor market policy, housing and
international trade.  At  Princeton , in  New Jersey , she is an economics professor,
conducting research into education and labor economics.  Rouse’s departure will mean both deputy positions on the
CEA will need to be filled. The other vacancy occurred when
Goolsbee was named the council’s chairman last September.  Both posts require Senate confirmation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
