  Public Power  Corp. SA and  Greece ’s
public gas company, Depa SA, have failed to agree on the price
and quantity of a natural-gas procurement contract,  Kathimerini 
reported.  Public Power wants to secure lower prices and quantities,
given lower liquefied natural gas prices, the newspaper
reported, without citing anyone.  As Public Power buys 60 percent of the gas supplier’s
production, the contract is a key issue for the planned sale of
Depa to investors and Greece’s energy and finance ministers are
expected to intervene in the next few days, Kathimerini said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
