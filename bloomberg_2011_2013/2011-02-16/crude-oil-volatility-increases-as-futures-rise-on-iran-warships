Oil options volatility increased as
the underlying futures rose after Israeli Foreign Minister  Avigdor Lieberman  said two Iranian gunboats are planning to move
through the  Suez Canal  to Syria.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 28.5 percent as of 4 p.m. in  New York , up
from 27.6 percent yesterday.  Oil for March delivery gained 67 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
settle at $84.99 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Futures have risen 10 percent in the past year.  March $85 calls were the most active options in electronic

cents to 10 cents a barrel. March $85 puts, the next-most active
contract, fell $1.03 to 1 cent a barrel with 4,685 contracts
trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of oil.  March options expired at the close of Nymex floor trading
today.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
