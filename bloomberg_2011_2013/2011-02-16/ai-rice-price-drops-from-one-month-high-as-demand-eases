Thai rice prices, the benchmark for  Asia , declined from a one-month high as overseas demand eased,
the  Thai Rice Exporters Association  said.  The price of 100 percent grade-B white rice dropped 0.5
percent to $555 a metric ton, said Pisanu Sangyoo, an official
at the association. The price was $558 a ton last week, the
highest level since Dec. 22.  The price of 25 percent broken rice gained to $492 a ton
from $487 a week earlier, he said.  The exportersâ€™ association holds a meeting every week to
set prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
