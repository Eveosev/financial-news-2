The Lusaka Stock Exchange received a
new request from  India ’s Bhartie Airtel Ltd. to delist its
Zambian unit from the bourse after regulators allowed the
company to raise its stake in the subsidiary to 100 percent.  The company has “submitted and provided reasons for making
an application to voluntarily de-list,” bourse Chairman Friday
Ndhlovu said in a statement in the state-owned Times of Zambia
today.  Bharti has won the right to buy out the remaining 3 percent
of shareholders who refused to sell their stakes, the Securities
and Exchange Commission said yesterday. About 2,000 shareholders
had turned down an offer of 710 kwacha ($0.15) a share from
Bharti.  Bharti announced on Dec. 24 it planned to delist from the
exchange after increasing its stake to 97 percent from 78.9
percent. That request was rejected because it “lacked merit,”
the bourse said.  The Lusaka bourse has 22 companies listed companies,
including Airtel, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
