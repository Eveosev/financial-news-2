  Taiwan ’s dollar halted a four-day
drop on speculation exporters were taking advantage of recent
weakness to repatriate income at a more-favorable  exchange rate .  The currency rose as much as 0.4 percent earlier before
ending little changed on speculation the central bank bought the
U.S. dollar, according to two traders who declined to be
identified as the monetary authority doesn’t disclose such
details.  “Although the current Taiwan dollar level isn’t very
desirable for exporters, it’s still a good time for them to buy,
given expectations for further appreciation,” said Samson Tu,
who helps manage $1.6 billion of fixed-income securities at Uni-
President Assets Management Corp. in Taipei.  Taiwan’s dollar traded at NT$29.470 against its U.S.
counterpart as of 4 p.m. in Taipei, compared with NT$29.469
yesterday, according to Taipei Forex Inc.    Government bonds  were little changed before an auction of
NT$30 billion ($1.1 billion) of 30-year notes tomorrow. The
yield on the 1 percent security due January 2016, the most-
traded debt, was 1.125 percent, from 1.120 percent yesterday,
according to Gretai Securities Market.  “Demand for 30-year bonds is always strong, and they’ll be
snapped up by insurance companies,” Tu said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
