  CBS Corp . television reporter Lara
Logan, a correspondent for “60 Minutes,” was sexually
assaulted while covering crowd reaction in Cairo to the fall of
President Hosni Mubarak, the New York Post reported, citing a
statement from the telvision network.  Logan became separated from her crew and security detail by
a mob on Friday, some of whom them subjected her to “a brutal
and sustained sexual assault,” the CBS statement said,
according to the newspaper.  She was rescued by a group of women and about 20 soldiers
and flew out to New York the next day, the Post said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:  Chris Peterson  at
