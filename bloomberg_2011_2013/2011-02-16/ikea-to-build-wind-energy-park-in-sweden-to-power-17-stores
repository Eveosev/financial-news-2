Ikea Group, the world’s biggest
home-furnishings retailer, will build a wind park in  Sweden  to
meet the electricity needs of its 17 stores in the Nordic
country as part of an effort to cut carbon dioxide emissions.  The park will have nine turbines and be located in the
central province of Dalarna, Ikea said today in a statement.  O2
Vind AB , a Stockholm-based wind developer, will oversee
construction and production is scheduled to start early 2012.  “A wind park in Sweden gives us a long-term source for
renewable energy,” said Peter Agnefjaell, head of Ikea Svenska
Foersaeljnings AB, in the statement. “It also gives us the
possibility to transfer the financial benefit of electricity
from our own wind power park to lower prices which will benefit
our customers.”  Ikea has 52  wind turbines  in Germany and  France  which
generate about 10 percent of its electricity consumption.  It may expand the idea to other markets, Ylva Magnusson, a
company spokeswoman said today by phone. The investment in
Sweden will be “several hundred million kronor,” she said.  Maria Lyckesjoe, a spokeswoman at O2, said output will be
70 gigawatt-hours a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
