  Metro AG ’s Media Markt consumer
electronics unit was sued by a trade union for obstructing the
election of a works council at a local store in Munich.  A labor court in Munich will hear the case tomorrow,
Margret Moenig-Raane, the deputy leader of the Ver.di labor
union, said today at a press conference in Dusseldorf,  Germany .
Ver.di will ask the court to annul the results of the election
over claims Media Markt pressured workers.  Ver.di failed to get a majority vote in the September
election because management told employees that wages may be cut
and workers fired if candidates tied to the union were elected
to the company’s works council, Moenig-Raane said.  “Media Markt’s treatment of the workers is ruthless,
irrational and illegal,” Moenig-Raane said.  The company respects the employees’ rights and doesn’t
obstruct council elections, Sven Jacobsen, a spokesman for the
Ingolstadt, Germany-based consumer electronics unit, said by e-
mail.  Media Markt has 237 German stores, two of which have a
council.  A works council is a special representative body workers
where employees can elect under German  labor laws  in companies
with a least five employees. All major German companies have
works councils, including Siemens AG, Deutsche Bank AG and
Volkswagen AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
