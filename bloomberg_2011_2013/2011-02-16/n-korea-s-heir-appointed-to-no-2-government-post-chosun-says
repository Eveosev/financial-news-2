North Korean leader  Kim Jong Il ’s
youngest son and heir, Kim Jong Un, has been promoted to the
country’s second-highest government post, the  Chosun Ilbo 
reported today, citing a person familiar with the issue it
didn’t identify.   The junior Kim was named vice-chairman of the National
Defense Commission on Feb. 10, an appointment that will be
formally endorsed by parliament in April, the report said. The
commission is North Korea’s highest government agency, headed by
Kim Jong Il.  The South Korean government has no information on the
appointment, Unification Ministry spokeswoman Lee Jong Joo told
reporters today in Seoul.  Kim Jong Un, thought to be 27, was appointed to the second-
highest military post of the ruling Workers’ Party in September,
paving the way to become the regime’s next leader. It was the
first time he was mentioned by state media.   There are currently four vice-chairmen on the National
Defense Commission, according to the Unification Ministry in  Seoul . The commission’s first vice-chairman post has been vacant
since Jo Myong Rok died in November of  heart disease . Jo was
also a member of the presidium of the ruling party’s Politburo.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
