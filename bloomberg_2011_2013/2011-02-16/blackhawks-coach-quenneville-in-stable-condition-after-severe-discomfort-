  Chicago  Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville is hospitalized in stable condition after “severe
discomfort” of a non-cardiac nature, the reigning Stanley Cup
champions said in a statement.  Quenneville, 52, became ill at his suburban Chicago home
last night, according to team doctor Michael Terry.  “He went to the emergency room and was admitted early this
morning,” Terry said.  Quenneville is 125-66-25 in three seasons with Chicago,
leading the team to two consecutive Western Conference finals
and the 2010 Stanley Cup title. The Blackhawks are 28-22-6 this
season, four points behind the Calgary Flames for the
conference’s eighth and final playoff spot.  Assistant Mike Haviland will coach in Quenneville’s
absence, starting tonight against the Minnesota Wild, General
Manager Stan Bowman said in the release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
