Fine Gael , Ireland’s biggest
opposition party and the likely leader of the next government,
may raise as much as 3 billion euros ($4 billion) by selling
state-owned assets, according to an opposition lawmaker.  “We are looking at raising 2 to 3 billion euros through
asset sales over four years,” Simon Coveney, the party’s
transport spokesman, said in an interview in Dublin yesterday.
Investors abroad “should be looking at Ireland now as a place
of opportunity,” he said.  Ireland, which accepted an 85 billion-euro international
bailout last year, will consider selling parts of gas provider
Bord Gais Energy and the country’s main electricity supplier,
the Electricity Supply Board, according to Coveney.  Fine Gael will also consider selling airport management and
forestry harvesting rights, he said, adding that the policy “is
a pragmatic response to a very, very difficult problem” faced
by the country. “We need to find ways of raising money.”  The party may be able to form a government on its own after
national elections set for Feb. 25, the Irish Independent said
today, citing a poll it commissioned that showed the party
extending its support.  Support for Fine Gael has risen 8 percentage points to 38
percent in the past two weeks, according to a poll conducted by
Millward Browne Lansdowne between Feb. 12 and Feb. 14, according
to the newspaper. The ruling Fianna Fail party had 12 percent
support, down 4 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
