The U.S. Defense Department’s five-
year weapons-buying budget, while lower than the military
planned last year, still results in annual, inflation-adjusted
growth of about 2.6 percent, according to an analyst.  Weapons procurement would increase to $137.2 billion in
fiscal 2016, up from $113 billion in President Barack Obama’s
fiscal 2012 budget released on Feb. 14, according to previously
unreleased Pentagon figures provided to Bloomberg News.  The plan calls for $117.6 billion in fiscal 2013, $125.9
billion in 2014 and $129.5 billion in 2015, before reaching the
$137.2 billion in 2016.  The figures represent real growth of 2.6 percent annually,
said  Todd Harrison , a  defense budget  analyst at the nonpartisan
 Center  for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments in  Washington .  “But the level of procurement spending is about 5 percent
less each year from fiscal 2012 to 2016 than the administration
previously proposed,” Harrison said. “So they are starting
from a lower amount and then growing, but the total dollar
amount planned is significantly less than previously
projected.”  The $113 billion for weapons in the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1 equals this year’s spending plan and is $7 billion less
than the $120 billion forecast last year, for example.  The pattern continues in fiscal 2013. The Pentagon last
year predicted the fiscal 2013 procurement request would be $124
billion. It’s now projected at $117.6 billion, the figures show.  Above Inflation  U.S. spending on weapons through 2016 was supposed to grow
faster than the overall defense budget, which will have annual
increases of about 0.5 percent above inflation, according to
Pentagon  charts  released Monday.  “Our goal would be to get forces and modernization to grow
by 2 or 3 percent,” Pentagon Comptroller Robert Hale said in an
interview in July 2010, while saying that “it’s not a given.”  Hale’s remarks were made months before Defense Secretary  Robert Gates  agreed to cut $78 billion through 2016 for deficit
reduction purposes and reduced the planned fiscal 2012 purchase
of  Lockheed Martin Corp .’s F-35 aircraft to 32 and shifted $4.6
billion into extended development. He also canceled the  General
Dynamics Corp . Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle program.  The weapons growth plan is dependent on the military
services meeting their goals of hitting a cumulative $100
billion in savings from overhead reductions and other
efficiencies and shifting that money to weapons and research.
The Navy plans the largest such savings -- $35 billion over five
years, with the largest annual reduction of $9 billion in 2016.  ‘Fairly Confident’  Hale  said  Monday he’s “fairly confident” the services
will meet their 2012 savings goals. Still, “I recognize that
when you get beyond 2012, the plans aren’t as detailed. So we
need to watch that carefully,” Hale said.  Gates  Monday said  even within the lower procurement request
“there are a variety of puts and takes, but there are a number
of new investment programs that are in this budget that went
above the original program of record.”  Harrison said the projected procurement numbers “are mixed
news for the defense industry.  ‘‘On the one hand, procurement is significantly less than
expected, but on the other hand, the budget shows real growth
over the next five years,’’ he said. ‘‘So if that holds that is
good news.’’  ‘Tough Choices’ Ahead  Gates told the House Armed Services Committee today that
one of the ‘‘tough choices’’ Congress will face is where to find
money for the Navy’s current five-year shipbuilding plan.  ‘‘A number of the Navy ships that were built during the
Reagan years will basically reach the end of their planned life
in the 2020s, and where the money comes from to replace those
surface ships is going to be a challenge,’’ Gates said.  The challenge is heightened ‘‘if you put it alongside the
Navy acquiring a new ballistic missile submarine,’’ Gates said.  The Navy’s five-year plan envisions spending $16.9 billion
to buy 12 ships in fiscal 2015 and $15.1 billion for nine in
2016. That’s up from a $14.1 billion request next year for 10
vessels.  The plan doesn’t include funding for the next generation of
up to 12 ballistic missile submarines that the nonpartisan  Congressional Budget Office  estimated last year could cost $8.2
billion apiece. The Navy is seeking to build the submarines for
$4.9 billion apiece, officials said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
