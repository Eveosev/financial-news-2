The Czech and Slovak  power
transmission networks  and market operators will work on
enhancing daily power trading in both countries, according to
OTE AS, the company that runs the Czech  electricity market .  The group considers western  Europe ’s price-coupling model
as the most appropriate for both markets and a link with  Hungary 
should be started in the meantime, OTE said in a statement on
its website.  “Market coupling with the Hungarian market area is a
logical intermediate, progressive step before the final market
coupling with the CWE (Central Western European region) takes
place,” OTE said in the  statement .  By connecting countries through the market-coupling process
the efficiency of international cables is maximized. The
European Commission has set a target to achieve complete market
coupling by 2015, gradually bringing prices in neighboring
countries closer together.  The mechanism was in January introduced on a cable between  Norway  and the Netherlands, while  Germany  was linked with
France, the Netherlands and Belgium in November. Poland and
Sweden linked their day-ahead power markets through a 600-
megawatt undersea cable in December.  OTE said a team of representatives of all involved parties
was established to manage the project of market integration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
