  Altair Nanotechnologies Inc ., a
Reno, Nevada-based battery maker, climbed the most in more than
two weeks after it announced an $18 million contract to install
an energy storage system at a power station in  El Salvador .  Altair rose 28 cents, or 9.1 percent, to $3.09 at 10:58
a.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Earlier the shares reached
$3.25, up 15 percent, the largest percentage gain since Jan. 31.  The deal, announced after the close of regular trading
yesterday, is Altair’s largest to date, according to the
statement.  Altair will install its ALTI-ESS at El Salvador utility
Inversiones Energeticas SA’s Talnique power station. The 10-
megawatt system uses lithium-titanate battery chemistry and is
expected to go into operation in early 2012, according to the
statement. It will manage voltage frequency fluctuations on the
utility’s grid, reducing operating and maintenance costs, the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
