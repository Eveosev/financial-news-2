The  U.S.  PGA Tour  is in talks to
stage its Barclays  tournament  at New York’s Bethpage State Park
Black  course , site of two U.S. Opens, the  Associated Press 
reported.  AP, citing a person it didn’t identify, said the Long
Island public course would host the opening event of the PGA
Tour’s FedEx Cup playoffs in 2012.  The tournament has rotated to courses around the New York
and northern New Jersey area since 2007. The 2011 event will be
played at Plainfield Country Club in Edison, New Jersey.  Ty Votaw, a PGA Tour spokesman, declined to comment on the
report in an e-mail. Dave Catalano, the park’s director, didn’t
immediately return an e-mail seeking comment.  Bethpage Black was the site of Tiger Woods’s three-shot
U.S. Open victory in 2002 and Lucas Glover’s win in 2009, when
the tournament was stretched to five days by rain.  The plan would need to be approved by the  New York  State
Parks and Recreation Department and the Tour’s policy board, AP
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
