Fondul Proprietatea SA, a Romanian
property fund, said net profit declined 38 percent last year to
456 million lei ($145 million) from 730 million lei a year
earlier.  Fondul Proprietatea, with stakes in 83 companies valued at
3.6 billion euros ($4.9 billion), said its total assets rose
last year to 12.22 billion lei from 12.19 billion lei in 2009,
according to a statement to the Bucharest Stock Exchange late
yesterday.  The fund’s revenue slumped by half to 577 million lei from
1.3 billion lei because 2009 revenue was boosted by the one-off
sale of a holding in  CEZ AS ’s Romanian units, worth 230 million
euros ($311.6 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
