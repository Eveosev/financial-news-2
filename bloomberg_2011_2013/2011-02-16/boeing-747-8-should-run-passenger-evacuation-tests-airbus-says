  Boeing Co . should be required by
U.S. regulators to run passenger-evacuation tests on its new
747-8 Intercontinental since the jumbo jet can carry more people
than its predecessor, rival Airbus SAS’s sales chief said.  Boeing, whose original 747 first flew in 1968, unveiled its
latest version of the aircraft last weekend. The 747-8 will
carry about 467 passengers in a typical three-class
configuration, about  12 percent  more than the 747-400 flying
today, according to Boeing’s website.  The Chicago-based company has asked U.S. aviation officials
for a waiver on emergency evacuation tests for the new model
because of tests performed on the original version four decades
ago, Airbus Chief Operating Officer John Leahy told journalists
today in Paris.  “That’s wrong,” he said. “I intend to fly in that
airplane one of these days and I’d like to know you can get out
of it.”  Boeing declined to respond directly to Leahy’s comment. The
company will work closely with the U.S.  Federal Aviation
Administration  on certification for the 747-8.  “We will meet or exceed all certification standards,”
said  Jim Proulx , a spokesman for the Chicago-based planemaker.  The FAA couldn’t immediately comment, a spokesman said.  Emergency evacuation tests require a planemaker to fill the
aircraft with the maximum number of passengers and crew that
it’s certified to carry, and then have everyone exit the plane
in darkness, with random doors shut, to ensure that the plane
can be emptied in the event of an emergency.  Airbus in 2006 evacuated 873 people from its A380 in 80
seconds, 10 seconds faster than its goal. One person broke a leg
in the exercise, which was carried out in a dark hangar at an
Airbus factory in Hamburg.  Boeing plans to take the 747-8 on its first flight before
the end of March.  To contact the reporters on this story:
