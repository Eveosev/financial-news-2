  Research In Motion Ltd ., the maker
of the BlackBerry smartphone, will benefit from the ‘commotion’
caused by Nokia Oyj’s alliance with  Microsoft Corp ., according
to a Citigroup Inc. analyst.  RIM, based in Waterloo, Ontario, should be able to draw new
customers as wireless operators shift their promotions and
marketing support away from Nokia while it develops phones that
use Microsoft’s software, Jim Suva, a Citigroup analyst, wrote
in a research report today. He raised his rating on RIM to
“buy” from “sell,” with a price target of $80.  “Nokia is completely changing its strategy to now embrace
the Microsoft mobile operating system thereby creating a multi
quarter gap in Nokia products and carrier promotion support,”
Suva wrote. “We met several international carriers at Mobile
World Congress in Barcelona this week who commented on their
forthcoming shift to promote other” mobile-phone makers.    Apple Inc . and companies that use  Google Inc .’s Android
software are also likely to benefit, Suva said. He has had a
sell on RIM since November 2009.  RIM rose $3.05, or 4.7 percent, to $68.35 at 4 p.m. New
York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. RIM fell 14 percent
last year as Apple climbed 53 percent and Google declined 4.2
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
