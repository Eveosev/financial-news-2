  Kenya , East Africa’s largest
economy, increased the size of its revolving fund for coffee
farmers by 25 percent this year in an effort to boost production
and improve quality, according to George Ooko, chief executive
officer of the  Coffee Development Fund .  The fund was increased to $15 million from $12 million last
year because of increased government funding and helped by
interest payments accruing from loans to farmers, he said in an
interview today in Arusha, in neighboring  Tanzania .  Kenya started the fund in April 2007 with an initial $10
million to help small-scale farmers revive production which
dropped from more than 100,000 metric tons in 1988-89 because of
a slump in global prices and farm mismanagement. The fund aims
to help farmers buy fertilizers, pesticides and equipment.  Kenya may produce 40,000 tons of the beans during the 12
months to Sept. 30, down from a previous forecast of between
49,000 tons and 55,000 tons, according to James Wahome, quality
manager at the  Coffee Board of Kenya . The country produced about
45,000 tons last season.  Coffee sales through the Nairobi Coffee Exchange are also
increasing as farmers fail to take advantage of direct sales,
said Isabella Nkonge, chief technical and regulatory services
manager at the board, in an interview in Arusha today.  Sales through the exchange rose to about 91 percent of the
total last year, from 85 percent in 2008-09, she said. Direct
sales were introduced in 2005 after farmers complained that the
exchange had a monopoly on exports.  “The share of direct sales has dropped because some
farmers couldn’t meet the desired volumes and requirements like
certification,” Nkonge said. “Even then, farmers were still
depending on marketing agents to handle their deals.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
