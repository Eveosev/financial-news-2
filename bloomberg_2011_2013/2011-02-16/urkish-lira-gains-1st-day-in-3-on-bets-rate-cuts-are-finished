The Turkish lira appreciated for the
first time in three days on speculation the central bank’s
decision to leave its main interest rate on hold yesterday
indicates borrowing-cost reductions are over.  The lira gained 0.4 percent to 1.5902 per dollar at 10:30
a.m. in Istanbul.  “The lira is trading up on the expectation that the
interest-rate cuts have come to an end and the movement in rates
will be upwards from now on,” Eren Yardimci, a currency trader
at Akbank TAS in Istanbul, said by telephone.  The central bank in Ankara kept its one-week repo lending
rate at a record low of 6.25 percent. Six of seven economists
surveyed by Bloomberg this week had predicted no change.  The  ISE National 100 Index  of stocks advanced 125.2 or 0.2
percent, to 64,927.35. The yield on two-year bonds fell 1 basis
point to 8.33 percent, according to the RBS Istanbul Benchmark
Bond Index.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
