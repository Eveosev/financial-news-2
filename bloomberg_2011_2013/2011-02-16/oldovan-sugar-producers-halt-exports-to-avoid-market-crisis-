Moldovan sugar producers halted
exports temporarily to avoid a “crisis” in the domestic
market, the Agriculture Ministry said.  Local prices climbed as high as 16 leu ($1.33) a kilogram
(2.2 pounds) from 11.5 leu in the past two months in line with
gains in neighboring countries and on international markets, the
ministry said in a  statement  on its website today. The decision
to stop shipments took place at a meeting of the Consultative
Sugar Council held in the ministry, it said.  Moldovan beet-sugar production exceeded 100,000 metric tons
in 2010, compared with domestic demand of 65,000 tons, according
to the ministry. The country’s two biggest producers,  Suedzucker
AG ’s local unit and Magt-Vest, exported between 28,000 and
29,000 tons of the sweetener from last year’s beet-sugar crop,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
