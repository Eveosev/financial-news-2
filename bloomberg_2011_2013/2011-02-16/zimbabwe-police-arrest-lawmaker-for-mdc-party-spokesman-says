Zimbabwean police yesterday arrested
 Movement for Democratic Change  lawmaker Douglas Mwonzora on
unspecified charges, said Pishai Muchauraya, a spokesman for the
party.  “Mwonzora was arrested as he was leaving parliament
yesterday evening,” Muchauraya said in a phone interview from
Mutare today. “He was ambushed by police from the Law and Order
Section.”  Mwonzora is the co-chairman of the Constitutional Select
Committee, formed to draft a new constitution under a 2008 power
sharing accord between the MDC and President Robert Mugabe’s
 Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front . The agreement
followed a decade of political and economic crises in the
southern African nation.  “Mwonzora held a meeting in his Nyanga constituency over
the weekend which was disrupted by suspected Zanu-PF youths,”
said Muchauraya, the MDC spokesman for the eastern Manicaland
Province. “After Mr Mwonzora complained to the police, instead
of arresting the Zanu-PF youths, nine members of the MDC were
arrested.”  Police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena didn’t answer calls when
Bloomberg News sought comment from his office today.  Zimbabwe ’s
state-owned  broadcaster , which is controlled by Zanu-PF, quoted
a police spokesman named only as Mandipaka as saying Mwonzora
had been arrested for “politically motivated violence”.  “We believe that the police may now have taken Mwonzora
from Harare to either Nyanga or Mutare,” Kumbirai Mafunda, a
director of  Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights  said in a phone
interview from Harare.  To contact the reporter on this story:
