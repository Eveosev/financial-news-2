Sales at major South Korean 
department stores rose at the fastest pace on record in January,
adding to the case for higher borrowing costs as  consumer
spending  spurred price pressures.  Outlays at the three biggest chains climbed 24 percent in
January from a year earlier, after rising 11.6 percent in
December, the Ministry of  Knowledge Economy  said in a statement
today. It said the increase is the highest since it began
compiling the data in 2005 using the current methodology.  Inflation breached the Bank of  Korea ’s 4 percent ceiling
last month as consumers stepped up purchases ahead of the Lunar
New Year holiday. Governor Kim Choong Soo has indicated a pause
in interest-rate increases last week may only be temporary,
saying the bank will “move ahead with normalizing” borrowing
costs at an appropriate pace.  The economy expanded 6.1 percent for last year as a whole,
the fastest pace since 2002. Inflation quickened to 4.1 percent
in January from 3.5 percent in December, compared with the
central bank’s target of 2 percent to 4 percent through 2012.  Discount-store sales increased 21.4 percent in January from
a year earlier, after a gain of 2.9 percent in December, today’s
report showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
