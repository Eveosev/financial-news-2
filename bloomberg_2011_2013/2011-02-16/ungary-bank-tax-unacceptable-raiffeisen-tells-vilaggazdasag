Hungary’s special tax on banks is
“unacceptable” because it’s based on total assets and not
profit or risky loans, the head of Raiffeisen Bank’s local unit
said, according to business daily  Vilaggazdasag .  The bank tax paid in the second half of 2010 was calculated
based on end-2009 data, which makes it impossible to account for
any changes in size or risk profile during the year, Heinz Wiedner, the new chief executive of Raiffeisen’s Hungarian unit,
told the newspaper in an interview.  Banks shouldn’t be made responsible for “all the problems
in the economy,” by making them pay the tax, Wiedner said,
according to Vilaggazdasag.  To contact the reporter on this story:
