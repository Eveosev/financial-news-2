  Game Group Plc ,  Europe ’s biggest
electronics-games retailer, said it’s seeking more online and
digital sales, a step that will lower gross margin.  Game also wants to improve integration between its websites
and stores, and bring more customers to its shops, the
Basingstoke, England-based company said in a statement.  Game plans to expand digital and mobile-phone sales, even
as it builds sales of products in its stores, executives told
analysts at a presentation today in London. Even in 2015, 75
percent of U.K. game-industry sales will still be gaming
software and consoles, the company said.  “The games industry is changing, and we will be focused on
reinventing ourselves to follow our customers,” Chief Executive
Officer Ian Shepherd said.  In December, Game said margins are narrowing as consumers
seek bargains in the wake of discounting at competitors such as
supermarkets and  Amazon.com Inc . The new mix of sales will cost
it about 1 percentage point in gross margin in the year ending
January 2012, the company said today.  Digital sales, which represented about 2.5 percent of
revenue in 2010, should triple this year, Shepherd said. The
company hopes to double sales of own-brand accessories, he said.  Game is experimenting with offering mobile-phone
downloading of games in outlets, Shepherd said. Customers will
be able to order products in stores they can have delivered to
their home, and pick up orders in stores, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
