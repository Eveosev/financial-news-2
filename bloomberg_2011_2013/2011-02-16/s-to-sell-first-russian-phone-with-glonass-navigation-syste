OAO Mobile TeleSystems plans in
April to start selling  Russia ’s first smart phones equipped
with the Glonass navigation network, a rival to the U.S. Global
Positioning System.  The device, which is called MTS Glonass 945, will cost
about 11,000 rubles ($376) and also be compatible with GPS,
Maria Lapuk, spokeswoman at Russia’s largest mobile-phone
company, said by phone today in Moscow.  Glonass is a Soviet-era project that stalled after funding
collapsed along with communism in 1991. The government last year
earmarked 27.9 billion rubles for the project, which faced a
setback in December when a Proton-M rocket that aimed to deliver
three Glonass navigation satellites into orbit fell into the  Pacific Ocean .  To contact the reporter on this story: Marina Sysoyeva in Moscow
