  Intel Corp . said the MeeGo mobile
operating system developed with  Nokia Oyj  has a future even
after the Finnish handset maker’s decision to use  Microsoft
Corp .’s software in some devices.  “I don’t see that Nokia changing its strategy changes the
industry strategy,” Chief Executive Officer  Paul Otellini  said
in an interview on the sidelines of a conference in Barcelona
today. “The operators still look for an open, operator-friendly
operating system.”  Meego will be used in tablets this year, the CEO said. It
will also be used in mobile phones and in embedded devices in
the automotive industry, he said. Intel announced in February
last year that it would work with Nokia on a joint platform.  Nokia, led by Chief Executive Officer Stephen Elop,
unveiled plans last week to make Microsoft’s Windows its primary
software in the competition for smartphone customers. The
company is competing against Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android
platforms.  Elop plans to ship one MeeGo product this year as “an
opportunity to learn” before redeploying MeeGo team members and
product elements to Windows Phone 7 and future platforms.  Otellini said today he “understood” why Nokia is pursuing
a tie-up with Microsoft and said he would have made “the same
or a similar call.”  Intel is seeking to recruit mobile-phone makers as
customers for its scaled-down PC chips. Smartphones powered by
its chips will be available this year, Otellini said at the
conference.  Editors: Robert Valpuesta, Simon Thiel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
