Ghana’s currency, the cedi,
strengthened against the  U.S. dollar  on speculation that demand
for three-year bonds in an auction today by the Bank of  Ghana 
more than met the offer amount.  The currency, which was unchanged through the morning,
traded at 1.5085 at 1:40 p.m. in the capital, Accra, from 1.5115
at 9 a.m. this morning, according to data from Stanbic Bank
Ghana Ltd.  “The information we are getting is that the three-year
bond has been oversubscribed,” Chris Nettey, a currency trader
at the lender, said in a telephone interview from Accra. “Some
traders began speculating on that.”  The Bank of Ghana today offered 400 million cedis ($264
million) worth of three-year bonds, the first such securities
offered this year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
