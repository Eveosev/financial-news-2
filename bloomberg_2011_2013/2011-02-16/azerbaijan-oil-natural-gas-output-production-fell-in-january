  Azerbaijan â€™s oil and natural-gas
output fell in January from the same month last year, the State
Statistics Committee said.  Oil output fell 3.8 percent in the period to 4.1 million
metric tons (970,000 barrels a day), while gas production
declined 11 percent to 2 billion cubic meters, the committee
said on its website, without giving a reason for the change. The
former Soviet republic pumped 51 million tons of oil and 27
billion cubic meters of gas last year.  Azerbaijan aims to double gas output by 2020, Deputy Energy
and Industry Minister Natig Abbasov said yesterday in the
capital Baku.  To contact the reporter on this story:
