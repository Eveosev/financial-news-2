Taiwan firms should use the striking
prices of foreign exchange trades in earnings report, instead of
the closing prices after the central bank stepped in the market,

the Financial Supervisory Commission. Intraday prices are
usually NT$1 stronger than the closing levels, and the clarified
rules may cause some companies to report losses in the fourth
quarter, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
