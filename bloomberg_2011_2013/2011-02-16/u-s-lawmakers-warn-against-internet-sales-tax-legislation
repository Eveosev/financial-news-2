More than a dozen U.S. lawmakers
today called on their colleagues in Congress to avoid
legislation that would let states impose taxes on online
retailers.  New York and other states have instituted a  sales tax  for
goods purchased on the Internet in recent years. Online
retailers led by  Amazon.com Inc . stand to lose about $7 billion
in annual revenue if such laws are adopted nationwide, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “At a time when we are trying to foster a sustained
economic recovery, it doesn’t make sense to saddle entrepreneurs
with tax requirements that stifle growth,” Representative
Daniel Lungren, a California Republican who submitted the
resolution, said in a written  statement .  The effort, supported by Republican and Democratic
lawmakers, garnered support from  EBay Inc ., which operates one
of the world’s largest e-commerce sites.  “This resolution sends an early signal to those who
support new, burdensome and unfair tax collection schemes on
online entrepreneurs that Congress will protect Internet-enabled
small businesses,” said Tod Cohen, EBay vice president for
government relations, in a written statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
