Investors holding 50 percent of the
 Puerto Venecia  shopping and leisure park in  Spain  are in talks
to sell their stake to Orion Capital Managers LP, according to
three people with knowledge of the matter.  The sellers are Spanish builder  Copcisa Corp.  and private
investors in the development in Zaragoza, northeastern Spain,
said the people, who declined to be identified because the
information isn’t public. They didn’t give a possible price.  Construction was started in 2006 by a joint venture between
Copcisa, London-based British Land Co., and private investors.
British Land, the U.K.’s second-largest real estate investment
trust, said in 2006 that the 2.2 million square-foot (204,000
square-meter) development would have a value of about 500
million euros ($677 million) when completed. It opened in 2008.  Cushman & Wakefield Inc., the world’s largest privately held
commercial real estate broker, is managing the sale, the people
said.  A spokesman for Copcisa, which owns 12.5 percent of Puerto
Venecia, declined to comment. Representatives of Cushman &
Wakefield, British Land and Orion Capital Managers also wouldn’t
comment.  Puerto Venecia’s tenants include Ikea, the world’s largest
home-furnishings retailer, El Corte Ingles and Primark,
according to its website. The development includes 10,000 square
meters of waterway and an artificial lake surrounded by bars,
restaurants and recreational facilities.  Orion Columba, a fund owned by Orion Capital Managers,
purchased the Plenilunio shopping mall in  Madrid  for 235 million
euros in 2009 from  Banco Santander SA ’s Banif Inmobiliario FII
real estate fund. The fund had valued the property at 279.4
million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
