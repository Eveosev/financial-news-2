  Atos Origin SA ,  France ’s second-
biggest provider of computer services, said full-year profit
more than tripled, beating analysts’ estimates, aided by higher
margin offerings.  Net income rose to 116 million euros ($157 million),
compared with 32 million euros a year earlier. Analysts had
predicted profit of 96.7 million euros, according to the average
of 13 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company’s operating
margin rose to 6.7 percent from 5.7 percent in 2009.  “We’ve had a good performance resisting these difficult
circumstances,” Gilles Grapinet, a senior executive vice
president, said on a call.  Atos Chief Executive Officer Thierry Breton will seek to
integrate  Siemens AG ’s computer-services unit, whose purchase
the company announced late last year, betting greater scale will
help it take advantage of a rebound in corporate technology
spending. Autonomy Corp. Plc, the U.K.’s second-largest software
company, posted a 13 percent profits rise last year as companies
increased purchases of cloud computing services.  Atos shares fell 0.5 percent yesterday to 41.36 euros. They
have advanced 33 percent in the past 12 months, giving the
Paris-based company a market value of 2.9 billion euros.  Atos announced a deal in December to purchase Siemens’s SIS
unit in a transaction valued at 850 million euros. The purchase
will help Atos leapfrog  Cap Gemini SA  to become  Europe ’s largest
information technology company. The deal, which will also
involve Siemens taking a 15 percent stake in Atos, is expected
to close later this year.  SIS Integration  “We are already ready to work in a joint manner with our
new colleagues from SIS,” Grapinet said. “Everything should be
in place by the day of the closing to allow the future company
to function as an integrated one.”  Atos said it expects 2011 operating margins of between 7.2
percent and 7.7 percent.  Also today, Atos today said it will propose a dividend for
2010 of 50 cents a share.  Paying a dividend “is an important decision for us in the
long history of Atos Origin, and a big part of what Thierry
Breton wanted to do when he arrived,” Grapinet said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
