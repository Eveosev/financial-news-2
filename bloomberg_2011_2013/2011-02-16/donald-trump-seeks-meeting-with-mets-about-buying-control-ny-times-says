  Donald Trump  contacted the owners of
the  New York Mets  about two weeks ago to set up a meeting to
talk about potentially buying a majority stake in the Major
League Baseball team, the  New York Times reported .  Trump said today he called Fred Wilpon to arrange the
meeting, which has yet to take place, the newspaper said, citing
the billionaire property developer.  The owners of the Mets said Jan. 29 that they may sell as
much as 25 percent of the team to raise money to settle a
lawsuit stemming from Bernard L. Madoffâ€™s Ponzi scheme. The
owners are being sued for as much as $1 billion over their
financial dealings with Madoff, the Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
