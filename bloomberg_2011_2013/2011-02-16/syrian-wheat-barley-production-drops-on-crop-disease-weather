Syrian wheat, barley and cotton
production fell in 2010 because of a crop disease and adverse
weather, according to the Ministry of Agriculture.  Wheat output dropped 17 percent from the prior year to 3.08
million metric tons as the fungal disease known as yellow rust
hit the crop, the ministry said in a statement. The government
had estimated production at 4.5 million tons, it said.  The ministry asked farmers to plant wheat instead of more
typical winter crops such as barley as a result of a drought
affecting domestic production of the staple grain, Al-Baath
newspaper reported last month.  Barley production declined 20 percent to 680,000 tons, the
ministry said. Adverse weather meant that output amounted to 43
percent of the government’s 1.6 million-ton goal, it said.  Cotton production slid 28 percent to 472,500 tons, the
ministry said, compared with the government’s 681,000-ton
estimate.  To contact the reporters on this story:
