Japan’s Topix index gained for an
eighth day, extending its longest winning streak in 18 months,
after the yen weakened and as brokerages raised investment
recommendations on some companies.  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc., Japan’s 2nd-largest
bank by market value, climbed 2.3 percent after Nomura Holdings
Inc. said the nation’s economy will rebound sooner than expected.
Sony Corp., Japan’s biggest exporter of consumer electronics,
advanced 2.6 percent. Toshiba Corp., a nuclear power-plant maker,
and  Asahi Glass  Co. advanced at least 2.2 percent after
brokerages increased their ratings on the companies.  “The worst of the economic conditions are behind us,”
said  Junichi Misawa , head of equity investment at Tokyo-based
STB Asset Management Co., which oversees about $14 billion. “If
the global economy continues to recover, that should boost
Japanese stocks.”  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.6 percent to 10,808.29
at the close in Tokyo. The broader Topix index gained 0.5
percent to 967.30. The Topix’s eight-day advance was the longest
winning streak since a 13-day run that ended Aug. 4, 2009.  The value of stocks traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s
first section totaled 1.84 trillion yen ($22 billion), the
highest level since Jan. 21.  The Topix has gained 7.6 percent this year, the most among
the major Asia-Pacific indexes. That has driven the average
price of stocks in the gauge to 16.5 times estimated earnings,
the highest level since July.  “There’s strong buying interest in the market,” said
Hiroichi Nishi, an equities manager in Tokyo at Nikko Cordial
Securities Inc.  Banks, Insurers Climb  Domestic-oriented shares, including banks and insurance
companies, extended advances after Nomura said in a report dated
Feb. 14 and released yesterday that Japan will “break out of
its current lull” in the first half of 2011, instead of the
company’s earlier prediction of the second half. Also, the  Bank
of Japan  yesterday raised its economic assessment for the first
time in nine months.  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group rose 2.3 percent to 3,140
yen and was the most-actively traded stock in Japan. Mizuho
Financial Group Inc., Japan’s No. 3 bank by market value, gained
1.8 percent to 174 yen. Resona Holdings Inc. jumped 5.4 percent
to 446 yen.  Insurers had the third-largest increase among the 33
industry groups in the Topix. MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings Inc.
climbed 3.4 percent to 2,228 yen, the highest close since June 1.
Tokio Marine Holdings Inc. advanced 1.8 percent to 2,739 yen, a
level not seen since April 30.  Yen Weakens  Sony advanced 2.6 percent to 2,981 yen. Nintendo Co., the
world’s largest maker of portable video-game machines and which
derives more than 80 percent of its sales abroad, jumped 4.3
percent to 25,460 yen. It was the biggest-single support for the
Topix. Tokyo Electron Ltd., a maker of semiconductor equipment
that derives more than 60 percent of its revenue outside Japan,
rose 2 percent to 5,650 yen.  The yen depreciated to as low as 83.84 against the dollar
today, compared with 83.46 at the close of  stock trading  in
Tokyo. Against the euro, Japan’s currency weakened to 113.38
from 112.87. A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas income at
Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  “Despite the yen’s appreciation, which continued until the
third quarter, companies reported strong corporate earnings, so
people are now positively reassessing Japanese stocks,” STB
Asset Management’s Misawa said.  Investment Recommendations  Toshiba advanced 3.2 percent to 549 yen after its rating
was raised to “outperform” from “neutral” at Nikko Cordial
Securities Inc., and Asahi Glass climbed 2.2 percent to 1,137
yen following a rating upgrade by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to
“neutral” from “sell.” Renesas Electronics Corp., an
electronic-components maker, leapt 9.6 percent to 986 yen after
the company had its rating increased to “buy” from “hold” at
BNP Paribas.  Consumer lenders had the biggest increase among Topix
groups after the Nikkei newspaper reported the cost of credit
default swaps of Acom Co. and Promise Co. fell to the lowest
since September, as concern eased that more borrowers will seek
refunds for overpaid interest. Acom soared 11 percent to 1,712
yen, its highest close since January 2010, while Promise surged
11 percent to 827 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
