Malawi’s Finance Minister Ken Kandodo said he expects economic growth to slow to 6.8 percent
this year from 7.1 percent in 2010 on weaker expansion in
manufacturing and telecommunications, the  Nyasa Times  reported.  Inflation will average 7.2 percent, little changed from 7.4
percent last year, Kandodo told lawmakers yesterday, the online
news service reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
