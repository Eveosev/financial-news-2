Zon Multimedia SGPS SA Chief
Executive Officer  Rodrigo Costa  said he will lower capital
expenditure to pay dividends and reduce debt.  Capital expenditure will drop to 155 million euros ($209
million) to 160 million euros this year from 245 million euros
in 2010 as the company has “finished a cycle of investment,”
Costa said in an interview in Lucerne,  Switzerland  today.  “We are coming from about 25 percent capex to sales and
now we’re aiming for it to drop in the long term to between 12
percent and 14 percent.”  Zon, spun off from  Portugal Telecom SGPS SA  in November
2007, had stepped up investments in its network to gain more
customers as it faced competition from its former parent, which
started a TV offering of its own in 2008. Reduced  capital
spending  will increase Zon’s free cash flow and allow the
company to “follow a different strategy, of paying down debt
and increase our dividends,” Costa said today.  “We are very close to announcing what the dividend will be
this year,” he said. Costa declined to say what the dividend
would be, adding that analysts expect a similar payment to last
year’s 16 cents a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
