  Clariant AG , the world’s biggest
maker of printing-ink chemicals, said it plans to fund the
acquisition of private equity-owned  Sued-Chemie AG  with 900
million Swiss francs ($935 million) of loans.  Clariant will seek to refinance the short-term debt later
this year or in early 2012, Patrick Jany, Clariant’s chief
financial officer, said in a press conference in Zurich today.  Clariant said it will acquire a 50.4 percent stake of Sued-
Chemie from One Equity Partners LLC,  JPMorgan Chase & Co .’s
buyout arm, and has agreed to buy shares from family investors
to take its stake to more than 95 percent. The 2 billion-euro
deal will help Clariant expand in chemical catalysts used in the
oil and automotive industries, the company said today.  Clariant estimates the combined company’s net debt would be
about 1.7 times the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization in 2011, according to its website.  The Muttenz, Switzerland-based company will also seek to
raise 400 million francs in a rights offering and use 500
million francs of its existing cash to fund the acquisition, it
said.  Standard & Poor’s ranks Clariant’s debt BBB-. Moody’s
Investors Service rates it Ba1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
