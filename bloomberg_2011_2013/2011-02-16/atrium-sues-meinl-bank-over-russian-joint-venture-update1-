  Atrium European Real Estate Ltd ., a
developer of shopping malls in eastern  Europe , sued Austria’s
Meinl Bank AG in what is at least the fourth case between the
two companies.  Atrium sued Meinl Bank and Chief Executive Officer Peter Weinzierl in a Vienna court for 15.8 million euros ($21
million), Atrium said in a statement today. The claim is based
on Atrium’s investment in a Russian joint venture in 2005, when
Atrium was still called Meinl European Land and managed by a
Meinl Bank unit.  Meinl Bank said in a statement that Atrium’s case was
“absurd” and “without foundation.”  Israeli property developer  Gazit-Globe Ltd . and  Citigroup
Inc . took control of Meinl Land in 2008, renaming it Atrium
after the company was investigated for using 1.8 billion euros
in 2007 to buy back shares without informing investors in
advance. Julius Meinl V, who heads the family’s business, was
arrested last year over the allegations and released after
posting 100 million euros bail.  In August, Atrium sued Meinl Bank, Julius Meinl and eight
other people and companies for 2.1 billion euros in  London .
Meinl Bank countersued Atrium’s management and key shareholders
in November for more than 1.2 billion euros.  Meinl also sued Atrium in December, seeking at least 34
million euros in legal costs. A dispute over unpaid interest on
a bond issued by Atrium to Meinl was settled this year.
Following the settlement, Atrium terminated trust agreements
with Meinl on its 2003 and 2005 bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
