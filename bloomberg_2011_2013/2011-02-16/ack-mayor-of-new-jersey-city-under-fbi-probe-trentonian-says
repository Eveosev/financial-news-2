Tony Mack, the mayor of Trenton,  New
Jersey , is being targeted in a U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation probe, the Trentonian newspaper reported, citing
an unidentified person familiar with the situation.  The investigation is looking into possible pay-to-play
violations and false Election Law Enforcement Commission
reports, the newspaper said.  Mack didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail or to a phone
message left by a Bloomberg News reporter at his Trenton office
after regular business hours. His spokeswoman, Lauren Ira, also
didn’t return a phone call or e-mail after business hours.  A call to the FBI spokesman in Newark, New Jersey, wasn’t
immediately returned. Rebekah Carmichael, a spokeswoman for U.S.
Attorney Paul Fishman in  Newark , said she couldn’t confirm or
deny the existence of an investigation.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
