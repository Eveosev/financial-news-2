  Ukraine ’s winter barley and winter
rapeseed crops may have been damaged by frosts in the past week,
the national  Hydrometeorology Center  said.  “The snow layer in the central, south and west of Ukraine,
where rapeseed and barley are mostly planted, is either absent
or insufficient to help plants survive the low temperatures,”
Tetiana Adamenko, head of the center’s agriculture department,
said today in a phone interview.  There are no snowfalls forecast soon, so the condition of
plants will depend on how long the frosts last, according to the
researcher. Temperatures will likely rise from Feb. 21, Adamenko
said.  Freezing temperatures were seen all across Ukraine from
late last week, according to the center’s  website . Night
temperatures reached minus 19 degrees Celsius (minus 2.2
Fahrenheit) in northern parts yesterday.  Grain fields in northern and northeastern parts of the
country are protected by snow cover, according to the
researcher. Any winter wheat losses won’t exceed 10 percent,
Adamenko said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
