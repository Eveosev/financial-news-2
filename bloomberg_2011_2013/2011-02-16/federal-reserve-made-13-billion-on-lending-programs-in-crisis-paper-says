The  Federal Reserve  earned $13
billion in interest and fee income on its liquidity programs
from August 2007 until December 2009, according to the New York
Fed.  The facilities generated $20 billion in interest and fees
before taking into account the $7 billion cost of funds, Michael Fleming and Nicholas Klagge, staff members at the New York Fed
said in a paper released today. The period between August 2007
and December 2009 represents the time the facilities were used
the most, the paper said.  The central bank’s payments to the  U.S. Treasury  rose 65
percent last year to a record $78.4 billion on increased income
from mortgage and  Treasury securities  it bought to boost
economic growth. The figure was based on preliminary unaudited
results and released last month. The Fed remitted $47.4 billion
in 2009.  The Obama administration projected in its budget that the
Fed’s payments to the U.S. government will peak this year and
decline each of the next four years, approaching levels from
before the financial crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
