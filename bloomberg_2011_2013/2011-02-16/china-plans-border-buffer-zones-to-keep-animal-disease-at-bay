China will build a 30-kilometer-wide
quarantine zone “as soon as possible” on its northeast borders
after foot-and-mouth disease was discovered in neighbors
including  North Korea , the Ministry of Agriculture said.  China will also tighten patrols and increase monitoring to
keep animal products from its neighbors from entering the
country, the ministry said in a statement on its website dated
yesterday.  Foot-and-mouth and avian flu outbreaks have occurred in  South Korea , Japan and North Korea since last year, causing
“severe threats” to neighboring provinces including Liaoning,
Jilin, Heilongjiang and Shandong, the statement said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
