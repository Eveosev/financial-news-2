The  St. Louis  Cardinals have offered
three-time National League Most Valuable Player Albert Pujols an
eight-year contract that may be worth more than $200 million,
 Sports Illustrated  reported on its website.  The offer came as the Cardinals and Pujols approached a
deadline of noon New York time today to reach an agreement or
suspend contract negotiations for the rest of the Major League
Baseball season.  SI.com based its report on people familiar with the talks.
Those people were not identified.  Pujols, 31, who is entering the final season of an eight-
year, $111 million contract, has spent his entire 10-year major
league career with St. Louis, making nine All-Star teams while
hitting .331 with 408 home runs and 1,230 runs batted in. If he
does not sign a new contract, Pujols would become a free agent
after this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
