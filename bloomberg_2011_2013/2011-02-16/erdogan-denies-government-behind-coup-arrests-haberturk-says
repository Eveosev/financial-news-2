Turkish Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s government is not behind the arrests of nearly 200
officers for alleged coup plots,  Haberturk  newspaper reported,
citing Erdogan.  “Those trying to tie these operations to the government
are delirious,” Haberturk quoted Erdogan as saying in an
address to his party in Ankara. Erdogan called on Turks, and
particularly on the opposition, to respect the judicial process,
saying the armed forces would emerge strengthened from the
trials, Haberturk said.  Opposition leader  Kemal Kilicdaroglu  said Erdogan, who
knows and had met with the chief prosecutor in Istanbul, was
behind the arrests and questioned whether the judiciary was
truly independent in Turkey, Haberturk reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
