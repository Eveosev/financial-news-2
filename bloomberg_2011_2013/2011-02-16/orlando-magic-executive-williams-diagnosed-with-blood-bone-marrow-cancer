Pat Williams, the  Orlando  Magic
executive who’s credited with bringing the National Basketball
Association franchise to the Florida city in 1987, was diagnosed
with blood and bone marrow cancer two weeks ago, the team said.  The 70-year-old senior vice president has  multiple myeloma 
and underwent his fourth chemotherapy treatment yesterday, the
team said.  “We have launched the treatment as fast and directly as
possible,” Williams said on Orlando’s website. “The mission is
remission. That’s the goal.”  Williams, who has written more than 70 books and raised 19
children, said he’s been told by his physician “the percentages
are good” that he will reach remission.  “The only pain that I have is in my lower back area and
some days are better than others,” said Williams, who has
reduced his workload at the Magic’s office. “There’s a pattern
of pain in my lower back and it’s intense at times.”  Williams led Orlando’s effort to get an NBA team in July
1986. On April 22, 1987, the league approved the franchise in  Florida .  To contact the reporter on this story:
