Natural gas futures declined in  New
York  for the first day in three on forecasts of milder weather
that may crimp demand for the heating fuel.  Gas slid 1.4 percent as temperatures may be normal or above
normal across most of the eastern and central U.S. through March
2. Prices have dropped 11 percent this year on speculation that
near-record production of the heating fuel will counter bigger-
than-average supply declines caused by cold weather.  “We went from record low temperatures to above-average
temperatures in most of the country,” said  Phil Flynn , vice
president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago . “This market’s
like a limbo stick right now. Everyone’s wondering how low we
can go.”  Natural gas for March delivery fell 5.5 cents to settle at
$3.921 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The futures pared losses at around midday
before resuming their declines. Gas has tumbled 26 percent from
a year ago.  The low temperature in New York on Feb. 26 may be 38
degrees Fahrenheit (3 Celsius), 8 degrees above normal,
according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .
The low in Chicago may be 31 degrees Fahrenheit, 6 degrees above
normal.  U.S. heating demand from Feb. 22 through Feb. 26 may be 7
percent below normal, according to Weather Derivatives in
Belton,  Missouri .  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  Supply Estimates  The department may report a larger-than-normal withdrawal
from gas  inventories  tomorrow because of cold weather last week,
analysts predicted.  The report may show a reduction in stockpiles of 233
billion cubic feet, according to the median of 20 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The five-year average drop for
the week is 150 billion.  Gas inventories totaled 2.144 trillion cubic feet for the
week ended Feb. 4, 2.1 percent below the five-year average,
according to the Energy Department.  Gas futures may fall below $3.40 in New York as production
rises, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch said in a report today.  “We now see front-month futures dropping below $3.40 a
million British thermal units in coming weeks and see downside
risks to our second-quarter average price forecast of $4.30,”
analysts including Sabine Schels in  London  said in the report.  Price Outlook  U.S. natural gas prices may stay below $4 through the
spring amid milder weather and a recovery in gas production
after outages earlier this month, Societe Generale analysts
Laurent Key and Stephanie Aymes said yesterday in a note to
clients.  The U.S. raised its forecast for natural gas output in 2011
by 1.5 percent, the Energy Department said Feb. 8 in its monthly
 Short-Term Energy Outlook .  Marketed gas production will average 62.32 billion cubic
feet a day, up from 61.38 billion estimated in January, the
department said.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
242,799 as of 2:54 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 302,000. Volume was 322,299 yesterday. Open interest was
944,994 contracts. The three-month average open interest is
807,000.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
