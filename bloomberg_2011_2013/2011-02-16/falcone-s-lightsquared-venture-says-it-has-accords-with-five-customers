Billionaire Philip Falcone’s
LightSquared Inc. wireless venture has agreements with five
customers to provide wholesale fourth-generation service, the
company’s chief marketing officer said.  LightSquared, based in Reston,  Virginia , has contracts with
a national retailer, a device manufacturer, one website, and two
carriers, Frank Boulben said in an interview yesterday in
Barcelona,  Spain . He declined to name the companies because the
agreements aren’t yet public.  LightSquared is seeking to compete with  AT&T Inc .,  Verizon
Wireless  and  Clearwire Corp . in providing 4G wireless service.
Under a Federal Communications Commission order, the company has
to build a network that covers up to 100 million Americans by
the end of 2012 and 260 million by 2016.  Boulben said LightSquared, which is backed by Falcone’s
Harbinger Capital Partners hedge fund, has amassed about $1.75
billion in debt and equity.  “We’re not going to raise more in the short term,” he
said.  The company has sufficient funding for the immediate future
and will seek more as it achieves network buildout targets,
Audrey Schaefer, a spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. “The cost of
capital goes down with each significant milestone, so
LightSquared is raising money strategically when it makes
sense,” she said.  GPS Study  The service provider will begin network trials this year in
Las Vegas, Baltimore, Denver and Phoenix after completing
testing in a lab in the Dallas area, Boulben said. LightSquared
is also in discussions with some carriers to share  network
equipment , he said.  LightSquared last month received a waiver from the FCC that
lifts a requirement that devices using its service communicate
directly with satellites. The FCC said LightSquared must
participate in a working group with makers and users of global-
positioning systems to ensure its service doesn’t interfere with
those communications.  Boulben said he was confident LightSquared would resolve
any concerns about GPS interference, including possibly using
filters on its cell sites. Groups such as Motorola Solutions
Inc., the U.S. Department of Commerce and some small aircraft
manufacturers have expressed concern that LightSquared’s service
may cause interfere with GPS and emergency communications.  “Most of our customers will use GPS so it’s very important
we get this right,” Boulben said. “Having the FCC waiver is
critical.”  AnyDATA Corp. , based in Irvine,  California , has produced a
prototype smartphone that will work on LightSquared’s network,
he said. LightSquared also said in October that  Nokia Oyj  would
make mobile devices for its network.  To contact the reporter on this story:
