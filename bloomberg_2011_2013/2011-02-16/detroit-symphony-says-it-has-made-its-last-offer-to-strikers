The Detroit Symphony Orhestra said
it has made its final proposal to striking musicians. The
orchestra said in an e-mail the final offer was made yesterday
and that it requested the union bring the proposal to a vote by
tomorrow.  The orchestra’s musicians have been on strike since October
and the labor action has caused the orchestra to cancel much of
its season. Today’s e-mailed statement didn’t provide details of
the offer.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
