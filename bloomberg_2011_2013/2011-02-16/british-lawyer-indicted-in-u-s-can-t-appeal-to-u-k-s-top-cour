A British lawyer wanted by U.S.
prosecutors over allegations he bribed Nigerian officials to win
contracts for  KBR Inc . on a $6 billion natural gas project won’t
have his case heard by the U.K.’s highest court.  Lord Justice Malcolm Pill said Jeffrey Tesler can’t ask the  Supreme Court  to consider a legal question relating to his case.  Last month the Court of Appeal ruled Tesler should be sent
to the U.S. to face charges. Tesler’s lawyers had said he
shouldn’t be extradited because the case has “strong links” to
the U.K. and British prosecutors are carrying out their own
investigation.  Tesler and another U.K. citizen were indicted on Feb. 17
last year by a federal grand jury in Houston, accused of
violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. If convicted of all
charges, each faces a maximum prison sentence of 55 years.  The case is part of an investigation into Houston-based KBR
over claims it bribed officials to win contracts to build a
liquefied-natural gas project in Nigeria. KBR in February 2009
agreed with former parent  Halliburton Co . to pay $579 million to
resolve U.S. criminal and regulatory charges related to the
Nigeria project.  Tim McAtackney, a spokesman for the Crown Prosecution
Service, didn’t immediately respond to a message seeking
comment.  Tesler’s lawyer, Stuart Jacobs, didn’t respond to a phone
message seeking comment.  To contact the reporter for this story:  James Lumley  in  London  at
