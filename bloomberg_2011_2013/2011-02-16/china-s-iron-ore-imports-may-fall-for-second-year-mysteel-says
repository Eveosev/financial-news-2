Iron ore imports by  China , the
world’s biggest buyer, may fall for a second year in 2011 even
as January purchases surged, as record prices spur output from
domestic mines, according to Mysteel Research Institute.  The price of 62 percent-iron ore arriving at China’s
Tianjin port rose to $190.60 a ton yesterday, the highest level
since the data became available in November 2008, according to
The Steel Index. China’s imports may fall “marginally” this
year after dropping 1.4 percent in 2010, Xu Xiangchun, chief
analyst with Mysteel, said by phone from Beijing.  “I am more inclined to say that imports may fall if prices
stay above $180 because Chinese mines are very active in
production,” Xu said.    Iron ore  imports fell last year for the first time since
1998 to 618.6 million tons because China took measures to rein
in property speculations and as domestic mines increased output.
Imports rose 48 percent to a record last month due to recovering
steel production and restocking amid expectation prices may rise.  Lower imports and higher iron output last year indicated
that Chinese steelmakers consumed 70 million metric tons more of
iron ore from domestic mines in 2010 than in 2009, Xu said.  China invested 330 billion yuan ($51 billion) in domestic
iron ore mines in the past five years and may achieve more than
100 million tons a year of concentrate production, with some of
the new capacity coming online this and next year, Xu said.
China may invest another 100 billion yuan this year, he said.  “We will see the imports post a big drop at some point. We
are hearing the record prices have impeded some buying
interests,” he said.  Low Growth  China’s steel production may rise 5 percent to 660 million
metric tons this year, the Ministry of Industry and  Information
Technology  said today in a statement. Output gained 9.3 percent
in 2010 after rising 14 percent in 2009.  The nation’s steel industry, the world’s biggest, has
“entered an era of low growth” amid slowing capacity expansion
and higher production costs, China International Capital Corp.
analyst Luo Wei said Dec. 15.  Cash steel prices in China fell 0.3 percent today, the
first drop this year, from a more-than-two-year high of 4,961
yuan on Feb. 15, according to the Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co. A price correction may occur as soon as March
because private steelmakers have been running at full capacity,
leading to higher stockpiles, Mirae Asset Securities Ltd.
analyst Henry Liu said in a note yesterday.  Xu’s forecast is echoed by the industry ministry, which
said China may keep iron ore imports at about 600 million tons
this year, indicating a projected 3 percent drop.  --Helen Yuan. Editors: Alan Soughley, Indranil Ghosh  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story
