U.S. crop values surged 22 percent
last year to a record as the world recovered from global
recession, increasing demand for American supplies and pushing

$20.2 billion from $18.7 billion, while commercial vegetable
harvests were valued at $12.6 billion, down from $13 billion.  Corn held its place as the biggest domestic crop, valued at
a record $66.7 billion, up 43 percent from $46.7 billion in
2009, according to the USDA, which also revised its 2009 figures
in todayâ€™s report.  Soybeans were the second-most valuable at $38.9 billion, up
21 percent from $32.1 billion, the USDA said. Hay fell 2.1
percent to $14.4 billion, while wheat surged 22 percent to $13
billion from $10.7 billion, according to the report.  The U.S. cotton crop was valued at $7.3 billion last year,
