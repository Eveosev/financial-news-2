Cocoa shipments from  Cameroon ’s main
port of Douala declined 59 percent in the week to Feb. 15,
according to data e-mailed by the harbor today.  Exports of the beans were 750 metric tons, from 1,850 tons
a week earlier, the figures showed. The average price increased
to 1,682  CFA francs  ($3.47) per kilogram (2.2 pounds), from
1,480 a week earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations using
rates published by the country’s Cocoa and Coffee Inter-
professional Board.  “We are already in the light-crop season,” said John
Atanga, communication officer with the Cocoa Development
Authority, by phone from Yaounde, the capital.  A kilogram fetched 1,358 francs in the southwest, one of
the highest production zones, Abong Abraham, president of Ekona
Farmers’ Cooperative, said by phone today. Farmers sold the
beans at 1,370 francs in the Littoral area, 1,370 francs in the
center region and at 1,350 francs in the south, according to
information e-mailed from the Cocoa and Coffee Information Relay
Centers in Bafia, Bertoua, Nkongsamba and Ebolowa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
