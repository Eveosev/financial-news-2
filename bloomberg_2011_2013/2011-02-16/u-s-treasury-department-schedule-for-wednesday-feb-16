The following is a reformatted
version of the U.S. Treasury Department’s daily release on the
schedule for Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and other officials:  At 10 a.m. before the Senate Finance Committee and at 2
p.m. before the House Budget Committee, Secretary Geithner will
testify on the Administration’s FY 2012 Budget, which lays out a
responsible plan that puts the nation on a path to live within
our means so we can invest in our future - by cutting wasteful
spending and making tough choices on programs we cannot afford,
while making the investments we need to grow the economy and
create jobs.  The President’s Budget cuts the deficit he inherited in
half as a share of the economy by the end of his first term;
includes proposals that will reduce deficits by more than $1
trillion over the next 10 years; and cuts non-security
discretionary spending to its lowest level as a share of the
economy since Dwight Eisenhower was President. These hearings,
which will be held in the Dirksen Senate Office Building and the
Cannon House Office Building, are open press.  Later in the afternoon, Secretary Geithner will meet with
Senator Sessions. This meeting is closed press.  To contact the reporter on this story:
