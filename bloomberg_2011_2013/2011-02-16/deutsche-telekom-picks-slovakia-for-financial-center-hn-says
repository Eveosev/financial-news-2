  Deutsche Telekom AG  chose Slovakia
as the location for its global financial-services center,
 Hospodarske Noviny  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The German phone company picked Slovakia over  Hungary 
because it uses the euro and its capital Bratislava is closer to
Vienna, Hospodarske said. The investment may create as many as
500 jobs, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
