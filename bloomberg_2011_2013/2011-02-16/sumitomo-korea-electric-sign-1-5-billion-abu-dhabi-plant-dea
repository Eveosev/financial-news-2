  Sumitomo Corp . and  Korea Electric
Power Corp . signed a final agreement for a $1.5 billion power
project in the United Arab Emirates, a Sumitomo official said.
Korea Electric also confirmed the deal in a statement today.  Sumitomo will invest about 5 billion yen ($59.7 million)
for a 20.4 percent stake while Korea Electric takes 19.4 percent
and Abu Dhabi the rest, Sumitomo spokesman Tsuyoshi Asada said,
confirming a report in the Nikkei newspaper. The group plan to
raise funds through project financing from nine banks, including
Japan Bank for International Cooperation and the Export-Import
Bank of Korea, Asada said.  The group signed the agreement with the Abu Dhabi Water
Electricity Authority yesterday, Asada said. Korea Electric and
Sumitomo won priority negotiation rights in October to build and
operate the 1,600-megawatt gas-fired facility in Shuweihat,
western Abu Dhabi. The plant is scheduled to begin commercial
operation in March 2014, he said.  Korea Electric said in its statement the operating contract
will run for 25 years after completion of the plant. The company
said it beat four other bids from Mitsui & Co., a consortium
including  Marubeni Corp . and Kansai Electric Power Co., a group
including  International Power Plc  and Tokyo Electric Power Co.,
and a French power company that it didnâ€™t name.  To contact the reporters on this story:
