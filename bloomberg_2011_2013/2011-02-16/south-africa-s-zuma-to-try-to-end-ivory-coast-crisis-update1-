South African President  Jacob Zuma 
will visit Ivory Coast on Feb. 21 in a bid to resolve an 11-week
political crisis in the West African nation, South Africa’s
Department of International Affairs and Cooperation said on its
website today.  The African Union has appointed a panel of the continent’s
leaders, including Zuma, to submit proposals to end the deadlock
between incumbent President Laurent Gbagbo and Alassane Ouattara, who is recognized as the winner of disputed Nov. 28
elections by the  United Nations , the African Union and the U.S.  Ouattara has tried to choke off Gbagbo’s access to funds by
telling businesses not to pay taxes to his administration and
banning exports of cocoa, which make up about a third of global
supplies.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Franz Wild  in Johannesburg at
