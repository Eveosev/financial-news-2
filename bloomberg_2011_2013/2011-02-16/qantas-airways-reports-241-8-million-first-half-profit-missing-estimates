  Qantas Airways Ltd . jumped the most
in more than a year in Sydney trading after reporting a fourfold
increase in first-half profit and predicting a rise in business
travel.  “We are still pretty optimistic,” Chief Executive Officer
Alan Joyce said today in a Bloomberg TV interview in Sydney,
where the company is based. “The corporate market is staying
with Qantas, and the corporate market is traveling more.”    Australia ’s biggest airline said average fares will likely
be higher than a year earlier in the six months ending June and
that capacity will increase 11 percent. First-half passenger
numbers, including budget unit Jetstar, jumped 9.1 percent as
demand withstood the 23-day grounding of Qantas’s Airbus SAS
A380 fleet following a mid-air engine explosion.  “The environment is really starting to look up for them,”
said Sean Fenton, who helps manage about $1 billion at Tribeca
Investment Partners in Sydney. “It’s a solid business with
great leverage to a recovery in business travel, while Jetstar
looks after the holiday crowd.”  The carrier rose as much as 5.4 percent to A$2.52, the
largest intraday gain since December 2009, as of 2:30 p.m.,
while the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index was little changed. Net
income surged to A$241 million ($242 million) in the six months
ended Dec. 31 from A$58 million a year earlier, according to a
statement.  Sales Jump  First-half sales rose 9.9 percent to A$7.59 billion. The
airline, which has a 65 percent share of its domestic market,
flew 22.9 million passengers in the period across its different
units. Joyce, 44, also cut expenses by A$173 million. The
carrier is “on track” with plans to reduce costs by A$1.5
billion by 2012, it said.  Earnings for the full year will be “materially stronger,”
the company said without providing a specific forecast.  “We are seeing our yield premium restored to levels from
before the global financial crisis,” Joyce said.  Disruptions following the Nov. 4 A380 engine explosion cost
the carrier A$55 million in the first half. The second-half
effect will be about A$25 million, Qantas said. The carrier
grounded its six A380s after the explosion of a Rolls-Royce
Group Plc Trent 900 engine on a flight from  Singapore . Qantas is
seeking compensation from the engine-maker.  The airline has returned five of the grounded A380s to
service and is adding four more this financial year as Airbus
works through orders. While the plane damaged in the explosion
is still out of service Joyce said it may resume flying later
this year.  Qantas Earnings  First-half earnings before interest and tax at the Qantas-
branded airline more than doubled to A$165 million from A$60
million after increasing passenger numbers on both domestic and
international routes.  Jetstar boosted earnings 18 percent to A$143 million as it
expanded services including at its Singapore hub. Qantas’s
profit from its frequent flier program climbed 20 percent to
A$189 million. The program, which has a tie-up with  Woolworths
Ltd ., Australia’s largest retailer, has 7.5 million members,
Qantas said.  The carrier today announced plans to lease an additional
five Boeing Co. 737-800s for the Qantas unit and 10 Airbus A320s
and an A330 for Jetstar in a fleet plan running up to the end of
June 2013. The carrier, with 173 planes on order for delivery by
June 2018, will also extend leases on some existing aircraft.  Joyce has set up a  task force  to review Qantas’s
international operations as the carrier faces competition from
Australia’s No. 2 carrier  Virgin Blue Holdings Ltd . and Middle
East rivals such as Etihad Airways and Emirates Airline.  All options will be considered to keep the international
operations “relevant,” Joyce said in a Feb. 3 interview. The
carrier’s  market share  on routes to and from Australia has
tumbled to 20 percent from 35 percent in 2000, according to
government data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
