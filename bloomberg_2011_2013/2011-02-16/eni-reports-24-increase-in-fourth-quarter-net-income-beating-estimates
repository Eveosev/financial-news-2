  Eni SpA ,  Italy ’s largest oil and
natural-gas company, said fourth-quarter profit rose 24 percent,
beating analyst estimates, on higher crude prices and output.  Adjusted net income increased to 1.72 billion euros ($2.33
billion) from 1.39 billion euros a year earlier, the Rome-based
company said today, surpassing the 1.59 billion-euro average
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 19 analysts. Net sales climbed
27 percent to 28 billion euros.  “In exploration and production, where we reported record
production, we paved the way for future growth thanks to our
entry into new countries including Togo, Democratic Republic of
Congo and  Poland ,” Chief Executive Paolo Scaroni said in the
statement.  Scaroni is seeking to boost output through oil and gas
ventures abroad. The company said production of liquids and
natural gas will increase in 2011, driven by fields in Iraq and
new startups in Australia, Algeria and the U.S.  Oil and gas production for 2010 increased 2 percent to 1.95
million barrels of oil equivalent a day, Eni said. Capital
expenditure was 3.9 billion euros for the quarter, bringing the
total for the year to 13.9 billion euros.    Brent crude  averaged $87.45 a barrel during the quarter, a
16 percent increase from a year earlier, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Higher oil and fuel prices have helped companies like Eni
boost profits. Exxon Mobil Corp. on Jan. 31 posted its biggest
quarterly profit in more than two years as it increased output
from its wells to the most in the company’s history. Total SA
reported a 23 percent increase in fourth-quarter profit and said
it will boost investments to help push output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
