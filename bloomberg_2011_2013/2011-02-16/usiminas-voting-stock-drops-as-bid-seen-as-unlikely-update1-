Voting shares of  Usinas Siderurgicas
de Minas Gerais SA ,  Brazil ’s second-biggest steelmaker, fell for
the first time in five days after Barclays Plc. said an offer to
buy the company from rival Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA is
“unlikely.”  Voting shares of Usiminas, as the company is known, dropped
1.1 percent to 28 reais at the close of Sao Paulo trading at
3:15 p.m. New York time and fell as much as 4.1 percent earlier.
The Bovespa index gained 1.9 percent to 67,570.76.  “We find it very unlikely that there will be a change in
control at Usiminas,” wrote Leonardo Correa and Renato Antunes,
analysts at Barclays, in a note to clients dated yesterday.
Should one of the controlling parties inside Usiminas decide to
sell its stake, Nippon Steel Corp., one of the controlling
shareholders, would probably exercise its rights of first
refusal, said the analysts.  Under Brazilian securities regulations, holders of voting
shares would receive at least 80 percent of the price paid to
controlling shareholders if the company is bought. No such law
applies to preferred shares.  Speculation on a possible bid has boosted Usiminas’s voting
shares, which gained 33 percent this year through yesterday.
Preferred shares fell 1.9 percent during the same period, and
gained 4.5 percent today. The voting shares reached their
highest price relative to preferred stocks in 12 years
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
