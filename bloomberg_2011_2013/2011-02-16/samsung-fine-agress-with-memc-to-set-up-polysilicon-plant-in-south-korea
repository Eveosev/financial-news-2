Samsung Fine Chemicals Co. agreed
with  MEMC Electronic Materials Inc ., a U.S.-based maker of
silicon wafers, to set up an equally owned venture for a
polysilicon plant in  South Korea .  The two companies will build the facility on an existing
Samsung Fine Chemicals property in Ulsan, according to an e-
mailed statement issued jointly.  The plant, which is expected to start operating in 2013,
will have an initial capacity of 10,000 metric tons annually,
according to the statement. The cost of the facility wasnâ€™t
disclosed.  Samsung Fine Chemicals will invest about 200 billion won
($179 million) in the venture, it said today in a separate
regulatory filing.  Samsung Fine Chemicals shares rose as much as 4.1 percent
to 81,000 won and were trading at 78,000 won as at 10:53 a.m.
