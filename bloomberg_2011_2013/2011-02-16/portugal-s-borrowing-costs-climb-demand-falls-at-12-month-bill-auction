  Portugal ’s borrowing costs rose at
an auction of 1 billion euros ($1.35 billion) of 12-month bills
as investors demanded greater yields to compensate for the risk
of default.  The securities due Feb. 17, 2012 were issued at an average
yield of 3.987 percent, IGCP, the country’s debt management
agency, said, compared with 3.71 percent at a previous auction
on Feb. 2. The auction attracted bids for 1.9 times the amount
offered, compared with a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.6 at the
earlier sale. The IGCP on Feb. 10 said the indicative amount for
today’s auction was between 750 million and 1 billion euros.  “Although demand fell, the yield was not as high as the
market was expecting, which is positive for the state,” Filipe Silva, who manages 60 million euros at Banco Carregosa SA in
Oporto, Portugal, said in an e-mail today.  Portugal is carrying out the deepest spending cuts in more
than three decades to convince investors it can narrow its
budget gap further after Greece’s debt crisis led to a surge in
borrowing costs for high-deficit euro nations. Ireland in
November became the second euro country after  Greece  to seek a
rescue and the first to ask for aid from the European Financial
Stability Facility, or EFSF.  Yield Spread  Portuguese 10-year bonds were little changed at 7.42
percent as of 2:04 p.m. in  London , while equivalent-maturity
German bunds rose, widening the difference in yield between the
two securities to 418 basis points from 413 yesterday. The
spread reached a euro-era record of 484 on Nov. 11. Portugal’s
10-year bond yield climbed to a euro-era record of 7.64 percent
on Feb. 10.  Earlier today, the IGCP said it bought back 190 million
euros of notes due in April and 25 million euros of debt due in
June. Following those purchases, the outstanding amounts of
these securities was 4.34 billion euros for the bonds due in
April and 4.93 billion euros for the bonds due in June, it said.  The government, which intends to sell as much as 20 billion
euros of bonds this year, faces no bond redemptions until April.  Portugal sold 3.5 billion euros of five-year bonds through
a group of banks on Feb. 7 at a yield of 6.457 percent. The
securities were priced 360 basis points more than the benchmark
mid-swap rate, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The spread was
140 basis points when Portugal raised 3 billion euros of 10-year
bonds in the nation’s previous syndicated deal on Feb. 10, 2010.  EFSF Flexibility  Portuguese Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos
said yesterday in Brussels that it’s “very important” that the
EFSF has the flexibility to buy  government bonds  and offer
different types of loans.  The average debt-service cost for Portugal is about 3.5
percent. In a projection that assumes “very high” funding
costs of 4 percent for the rollover of the entire Treasury-bill
program and 7 percent on all bond issuance, Portugal would still
have an “implicit funding cost” below 5 percent by 2013, the
nation’s debt agency said last month. Ireland pays an average
5.8 percent for its rescue financing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
