The economy of  Belgium , the sixth-
largest in the euro region, expanded for a seventh quarter in
the three months through December.  The economy expanded 0.3 percent from the third quarter,
when it grew 0.4 percent, the  National Bank of Belgium  in
Brussels said today. Gross domestic product increased 1.8
percent from a year earlier and expanded 2 percent for all of
last year.  Belgium may record “annual growth of 2 percent twice,”
National Bank Governor  Guy Quaden  said on Feb. 14 in comments
embargoed for today, referring to the latest 2011 economic
growth forecast of the federal planning bureau. The central bank
forecast growth of 1.8 percent this year on Dec. 6.  Belgian business confidence improved for a seventh month in
January, reaching the highest level since September 2007, as
executives in the manufacturing, services and retail industries
signaled they expect demand to rise in coming months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
