  Canada ’s dollar strengthened for the
first time in three days against the greenback as evidence of a
U.S. recovery spurred demand for assets such as equities and
commodities that benefit most from economic growth.  The loonie, as the currency is known for the image of the
aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, rose against the yen after a
report showed foreigners bought a record amount of Canadian
securities last year.  “The Canadian dollar should do pretty well,” said  Alan Ruskin , global head of Group-of-10 foreign-exchange strategy at
Deutsche Bank AG in New York. “It’s still looking robust as a
tag-along with the U.S. story.”  Canada’s dollar appreciated 0.5 percent to 98.49 cents per  U.S. dollar  at 5 p.m. in Toronto, from 98.98 yesterday. One
Canadian dollar buys $1.0153. The loonie touched 98.32 cents on
Feb. 4, the strongest level since May 2008.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.6 percent as U.S.
housing starts increased more than forecast and Paris-based
Sanofi-Aventis SA agreed to buy Genzyme Corp., a Cambridge,
Massachusetts, biotechnology company, for $20.1 billion. The
S&P/TSX Composite Index added 0.9 percent.  “Global risk appetite, favorable M&A flows and attractive
sovereign credit should keep the Canadian dollar from any severe
weakness,” Nathaniel Campbell, director of foreign-exchange
sales at Bank of Montreal in Toronto, wrote in a research note
to clients today.  Crude Oil Gains  Futures on crude oil, Canada’s biggest export, gained 0.9
percent to $85.08 a barrel in New York after Israeli Foreign
Minister  Avigdor Lieberman  said two Iranian gunboats were
planning to move through the  Suez Canal  to  Syria . The canal
authority’s head of traffic, Ahmed El Manakhly, said in a phone
interview he hadn’t been informed of any Iranian gunboat
planning to pass through the canal today.  The Canadian dollar rose against the yen as  Statistics
Canada  reported that foreigners bought a net C$9.63 billion
($9.76 billion) of Canadian securities in December, bringing
last year’s total to a record C$116.2 billion. Non-residents
bought C$3.1 billion of bonds in December, helping set a yearly
record of C$95.7 billion in that category.  Foreigners bought C$4 billion of stocks in December and
C$2.6 billion of money-market paper. Economists predicted a C$9
billion net purchase of Canadian securities for December,
according to the median forecast of five estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Loonie Versus Yen  The loonie gained 0.4 percent to 84.97 yen, from 84.63,
after touching 85.13 yesterday, the highest level since Aug. 5.
The Canadian dollar appreciated 0.7 percent to C$1.5850 against
the pound, from C$1.5961.  Canadian  government bonds  fell, pushing the yield on the
10-year benchmark up three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 3.50 percent after rising to 3.53 percent, the highest
level since May 13. The price of the 3.50 percent security
maturing in June 2020 dropped 20 cents to C$100.  Consumer prices excluding food and fuel rose 0.1 percent in
January after a 0.3 percent drop in the previous month,
according to the median forecast of 20 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. Statistics Canada is scheduled to release its
report on inflation Feb. 18.  “Hopefully we’ll get a breath of life after CPI,” said  John Curran , a senior vice president in Toronto at CanadianForex
Ltd., an online foreign-exchange dealer. “You get very low
inflation numbers, people are going to sell Canadian dollars.
You get higher-than-expected inflation numbers, people are going
to buy.”  To contact the reporters for this story:
