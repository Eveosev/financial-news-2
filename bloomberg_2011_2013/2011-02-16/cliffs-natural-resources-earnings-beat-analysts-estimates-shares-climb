  Cliffs Natural Resources Inc ., the
iron-ore producer that last month agreed to pay C$4.43 billion
($4.5 billion) for  Consolidated Thompson Iron Mines Ltd ., posted
fourth-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates as sales
increased.  Net income more than tripled to $384.4 million, or $2.82 a
share, from $108.2 million, or 82 cents, a year earlier, the
Cleveland-based company said today in a statement. That beat the
$2.22 average estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Sales increased 74 percent to $1.34 billion from $772.1 million
a year earlier.  Cliffs jumped $8.72, or 9.4 percent, to $101.60 as of 5:24
p.m. after the close of regular New York Stock Exchange trading.
The shares have climbed 19 percent this year.  The company said it sold 14 percent more iron-ore pellets
in the quarter as North American steelmakers utilized more of
their capacity. The average price of  iron ore  imported to  China ,
the world’s largest user of the raw material, was 64 percent
higher at $159.14 a ton in the quarter compared with a year
earlier, according to data from the Steel Index.  Cliffs maintained its forecast for the company’s North
American coal business with 2011 sales of about 6.5 million
tons. It increased its 2011 North American iron-ore sales
forecast to about 28 million tons because of the addition of
600,000 tons of the raw material not recognized in the fourth
quarter because of severe weather conditions.  (Cliffs scheduled a conference call for 10 a.m. tomorrow
New York time at +1-877-407-4134, password 00366298.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
