Hungarian lawmakers may confirm the
central bank’s four new rate-setters at the beginning of next
month,  Portfolio.hu  said, citing Antal Rogan, chairman of
Parliament’s Economy Committee, which may nominate them.  Parliament may pass an amendment to the central bank law
next week, handing the parliamentary committee the right to
appoint all four outside members of the seven-member Monetary
Council, Portfolio.hu said. Currently the prime minister and the
central bank president can nominate two outside members each.  Rogan said the committee will wait for the amendment to be
passed before nominating candidates to replace the four outside
members, whose terms expire on March 1, the news website
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
