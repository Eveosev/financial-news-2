An Oxford University study into the
causes of severe floods that caused 1.3 billion pounds ($2.1
billion) in damage determined that global warming made the
flooding more likely to occur, the Telegraph  reported , citing
the research.  Myles Allen, co-author of the report and professor in the
Department of Physics and School of Geography and the
Environment, said the warming climate made the floods twice as
likely because warm air holds more moisture, making heavy
rainfalls more frequent, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
