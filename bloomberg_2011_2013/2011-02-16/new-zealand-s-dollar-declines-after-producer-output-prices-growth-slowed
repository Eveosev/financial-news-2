  New Zealand â€™s dollar weakened after
a government report showed prices paid by producers for inputs
in the fourth quarter rose faster than the prices farms and
factories received for their output.  The currency fell to 75.44 U.S. cents as of 10:48 a.m. in
Wellington from 75.56 cents before the report from  Statistics
New Zealand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
