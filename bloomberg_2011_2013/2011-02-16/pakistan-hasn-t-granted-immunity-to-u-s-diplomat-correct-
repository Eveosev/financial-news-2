Pakistan hasn’t granted diplomatic
immunity to Raymond Davis, the U.S. consulate worker in  Pakistan 
accused of murder in the deaths of two Pakistanis, according to
an administration official.  The U.S. continues to assert that Davis falls under the
legal protections regularly accorded to diplomats in foreign
countries, the official said on condition of anonymity because
he wasn’t authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Pakistan
argues that these protections don’t apply to Davis.  President Barack Obama said today that Pakistan should
grant Davis immunity from prosecution in a case that has
triggered street protests in Lahore. The U.S. government
contends that Davis, who has been held since Jan. 27, acted in
self-defense when he was approached by robbers.  Senator  John Kerry , a Massachusetts Democrats and chairman
of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee , expressed sorrow for
the deaths during a visit to Pakistan today. He urged Pakistani
officials to focus on the broader challenges they face, which
includes the battle against militants on the border with
Pakistan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
