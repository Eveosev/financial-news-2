IOI Corp., Malaysia’s second-biggest
listed  palm oil  planter, said second-quarter profit climbed 12.8
percent, boosted by higher prices for the cooking oil and
contributions from its property business.  Net income gained to 520.2 million ringgit ($171 million),
or 8.15 sen a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, from
461.2 million ringgit, or 7.71 sen, a year earlier, the company
said in a statement today. Sales increased 29.7 percent to 3.97
billion ringgit.  IOI fetched an average 2,800 ringgit a metric ton for its
palm oil in the quarter, compared with 2,225 ringgit a year ago,
the company said. Futures have since further rallied on concerns
over tight supply, as heavier-than-usual rain due to the La Nina
weather event has hurt yields and disrupted harvests in  Malaysia 
and  Indonesia , the top producers. Prices reached 3,967 ringgit
on Feb. 10, the highest level since March, 2008.  “The group is expected to perform satisfactorily in the
current financial year underpinned by strong palm oil and palm
kernel prices and a resilient  property market ,” said IOI. The
group generates more than 8 percent of its revenue from real
estate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company’s resource-based manufacturing segment reported
a drop in profit mainly due to fair value losses on the adoption
of so-called FRS 139 accounting rules, it said. Total fair value
losses on derivatives contracts recognized were about 73 million
ringgit for the second quarter, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
