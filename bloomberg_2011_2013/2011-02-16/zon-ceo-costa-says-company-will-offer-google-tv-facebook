Zon Multimedia SGPS SA,  Portugal ’s
biggest cable-television company, said it will offer Google TV
to its customers if they demand it.  Zon could also offer YouTube, Picasa, Facebook and Flickr
services, Chief Executive Officer Rodrigo Costa said at a panel
at the Cable Congress in Lucerne,  Switzerland  today. “If we
refuse to do that, other guys will do it. We have to give
consumers what they want.”  Zon will respond to consumer demand and there are no firm
