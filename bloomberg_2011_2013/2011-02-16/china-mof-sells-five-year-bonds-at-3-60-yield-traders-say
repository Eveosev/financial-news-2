Chinaâ€™s  finance ministry  sold 30
billion yuan ($4.6 billion) of five-year bonds at an average
yield of 3.60 percent, according to traders at the underwriters
of government debt.  That compares with the 3.64 percent median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of 15 finance companies. The highest
winning-bid yield at the sale was 3.63 percent, said the
traders at the finance companies required to bid at the
auctions.  The finance ministry last month published a list of 59
underwriters required to bid at its debt sales, including
Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd.,  Agricultural Bank
of China Ltd ., Bank of China Ltd.,  China Construction Bank
Corp ., China Citic Bank Corp, Postal Savings Bank of China,
Industrial Bank Co., Guotai Junan Securities Co. and BOC
International   China ) Ltd.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
