1/  Includes imports and excludes exports.
2/  Revised 2010 data only.  Reliability of Turkey Hatchery Estimates  Survey Procedures:  Data for turkey hatchery estimates are collected from all
known turkey hatcheries.  Individual NASS field offices maintain a list of
all known turkey hatcheries and use known sources of hatcheries to update
their lists.  Approximately 40 hatcheries are contacted each month.  All
known turkey hatcheries are mailed a questionnaire as close to the first of
the month as possible and given adequate time to respond via mail, fax, or
electronic data reporting (EDR).  Those that do not respond are contacted by
phone.  Care is exercised to ensure that all hatcheries are accounted for in
the estimate.  Estimating Procedures:  Sound statistical methodology is employed to derive
the estimates from reported data.  All data are analyzed for unusual values.
Data from each operation are compared to their own past operating profile and
to trends from similar operations.  Data for missing operations were
estimated based on similar operations or historical data.  NASS field offices
prepare these estimates by using a combination of survey indications and
historic trends.  Individual State estimates are reviewed by the Agricultural
Statistics Board for reasonableness.  Individual hatchery data are summed to
State, regional, and U.S. totals.  Only U.S. level estimates are published
due to the limited number of hatcheries involved.  The Net Poult Placement
data includes imported poults and excludes exported poults.  Cumulative net poult placements beginning on September 1 and ending on August
31 are shown in the monthly “Turkey Hatchery” report.  This time period
corresponds with the placements of poults which will reach maturity and be
available for slaughter during the calendar year.  States reporting turkey hatcheries are:   Arkansas ,  California ,  Florida ,  Indiana ,  Massachusetts ,  Michigan ,  Minnesota ,  Missouri ,  North Carolina ,  Ohio ,  Pennsylvania ,  Rhode Island ,  Texas , Virginia, West  Virginia , and  Wisconsin .  Revision Policy:  Revisions are generally the result of late or corrected
data.  Revisions to the previous month are published in the monthly “Turkey
Hatchery” report, while annual revisions are published in the “Hatchery
Production - Annual Summary” report in April.  Reliability:  Turkey hatchery estimates are based on a census of all known
operating hatcheries and therefore, have no sampling error.  However,
estimates are subject to errors such as omission, duplication, and mistakes
in reporting, recording, and processing the data.  While these errors cannot
be measured directly, they are minimized through strict quality controls in
the data collection process and a careful review of all reported data for
consistency and reasonableness.  To assist in evaluating the reliability of the estimates in this report, the
“Root Mean Square Error” is shown for selected items in the following table.
The “Root Mean Square Error” is a statistical measure based on past
performance and is computed using the differences between first and final
estimates.  The “Root Mean Square Error” for turkey eggs in incubators on the
first day of the month over the past 24 months is 1.4 percent.  This means
that chances are 2 out of 3 that the final estimate will not be above or
below the current estimate of 28.2 million eggs by more than 1.4 percent.
Chances are 9 out of 10 that the difference will not exceed 2.4 percent.  Reliability of U.S. February Turkey Hatchery Estimates 1/
