VTB Group climbed for a fourth day,
its longest winning streak since October, after Russia’s second-
biggest lender had its weighting raised in the MSCI  Russia  Index
following the state’s sale of a 10 percent stake.  The stock climbed 1.9 percent to 9.7 kopeks, headed for its
biggest daily increase since Jan. 21.  The lender’s weighting will rise to 3.3 percent from 1.95
percent, according to calculations by Otkritie Financial Corp.
MSCI announced the change, which comes into effect on March 1,
by e-mail late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
