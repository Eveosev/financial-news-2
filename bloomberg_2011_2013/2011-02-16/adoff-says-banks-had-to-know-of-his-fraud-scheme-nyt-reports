  Bernard Madoff  asserted in a prison
interview that banks and hedge funds he did not identify were
somehow “complicit” in the fraud scheme that sent him to jail
for 150 years, the New York Times reported.    In a two-hour interview from the Butner,  North Carolina ,
prison visitor room conducted by the newspaper, Madoff said,
“they had to know.”   In what he described as “willful blindness” of some banks
and hedge funds, Madoff said the attitude was, “if you’re doing
something wrong, we don’t want to know.”   Madoff acknowledged his guilt in the interview, the
newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
