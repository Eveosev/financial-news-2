  Kulczyk Oil Ventures Inc ., an
exploration company controlled by Polish billionaire Jan Kulczyk, may start drilling Syria’s Block 9 by the end of June,
a company official said.  “We plan to start the two-well drilling program in Block 9
in the second quarter, provided we secure a drilling rig and all
other necessary equipment on time,” Jakub Korczak, the
company’s deputy chief executive officer, said today in an e-
mailed statement. “Tenders for these have been initiated and
the process is ongoing.”  The Calgary-based company won the right to explore the
block in 2007, but hasn’t started drilling. It has a 45 percent
net operating interest in the 10,032-square-kilometer (3,870-
square-mile) site in northwest  Syria . MENA Hydrocarbons Inc. has
30 percent, Triton Petroleum Pty Ltd. 20 percent and an
“unrelated” party 5 percent, according to Kulczyk’s  website .  Syria, struggling to halt a decline in crude oil output, is
seeking foreign investment in energy developments to help
stabilize oil output this year at a rate of 386,000 barrels a
day, Oil Minister Sufian Alao said Jan. 26.  Crude production peaked at 596,000 barrels a day in 1995,
and the country will deplete its existing reserves within 18
years, according to its reserves-to-production ratio as
calculated by BP Plc.  To contact the reporters on this story:
