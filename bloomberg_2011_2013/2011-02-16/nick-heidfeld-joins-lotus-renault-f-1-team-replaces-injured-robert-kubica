Nick Heidfeld joined the Lotus
Renault GP Formula One team as a replacement for injured driver  Robert Kubica .  Heidfeld had a trial for the team last weekend and he’ll
start in his new role at this week’s test session in Barcelona,
Lotus Renault said in a statement.  “The 33-year-old German is one of the most experienced
drivers in Formula One, having started 172 races over the last
11 seasons,” the team said in a statement. “He will race
alongside Vitaly Petrov when the season gets under way in
Bahrain on March 13.”  Heidfeld has raced for teams including BMW Sauber -- where
he was a teammate of Kubica -- Jordan and Williams.  “I would have liked to come back to Formula One in
different circumstances, but I’m proud to have been given this
chance,” Heidfeld said in the statement. “Everything has
happened so quickly, but I’ve been very impressed by what I have
seen so far.”  Kubica, a 26-year-old Pole, suffered multiple fractures in
a Feb. 6 rallying accident in  Italy . He underwent a seven-hour
operation to restore the functions of his right forearm and has
since had further shoulder and foot surgery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
