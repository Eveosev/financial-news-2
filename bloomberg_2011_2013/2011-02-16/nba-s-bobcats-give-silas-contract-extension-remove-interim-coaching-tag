The  Charlotte Bobcats  extended coach
Paul Silas’s contract through next season and removed the
interim label from his job title.  Silas took over the National Basketball Association team on
an interim basis Dec. 22 when Larry Brown stepped down after a
9-19 start. The Bobcats have gone 15-13 under Silas, climbing
into contention for a playoff berth.  “Under his leadership we have seen our team play with
confidence, enthusiasm and pride,” Bobcats General Manager Rod Higgins said in a statement.  Silas, 67, has a career coaching record of 370-413 with the
Bobcats,  Cleveland Cavaliers , Charlotte Hornets and  Los Angeles
Clippers . The Bobcats are 24-32 overall this season and in ninth
place in the Eastern Conference, where the top eight teams make
the playoffs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
