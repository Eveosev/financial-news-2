A driver with the Turkish delegation
accompanying President Abdullah Gul to  Iran  this week was beaten
after being caught up in a crackdown on anti-government
demonstrations, Milliyet newspaper reported.  The police who beat the driver later apologized, saying
they were admirers of Turkish Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan , columnist Taha Akyol, who accompanied Gul on the visit,
wrote in the newspaper. Journalists on the trip were unable to
communicate by phone or text message, or to access websites such
as Facebook and Twitter, he wrote.  The Iranian government is making the Feb. 14 rally look
smaller than it was, Akyol wrote, saying that the protesters he
saw were more than “a couple thousand people, it was a mass.”
Police, revolutionary guards and soldiers treated the
demonstrators “very roughly” as they broke up gatherings of
more than three people, blocked roads and closed shops, he said.  Gul and Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu struggled to
overcome the communications blackout, and were forced to send
urgent cables by telegraph from the Turkish Embassy in Tehran,  Turkey ’s TGRT Television reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
