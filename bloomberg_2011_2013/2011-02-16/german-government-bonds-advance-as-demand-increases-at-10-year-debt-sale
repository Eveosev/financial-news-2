German government bonds climbed as
demand rose at a sale of 10-year debt and investors scaled back
bets that  interest rates  in the region will increase.  The gains pushed the bund yield down to the lowest in more
than a week, while 30-year yields slid by the most since Jan.
14. Euro-area inflation will likely “progressively decelerate
in the second half of the year,” European Central Bank council
member  Guy Quaden  said.  Germany  received bids for 1.9 times the
securities sold, the debt agency said today. That compares with
1.6 at the previous auction on Jan. 5 and 1.2 in November. Greek
bonds fell for a 10th day, while Spanish securities gained.  “The auction was a happy surprise for the market,” said  David Schnautz , a fixed-income strategist at Commerzbank AG in  London . Bunds “should remain well supported,” he said.  The yield on the 10-year bund, the region’s benchmark
government security, fell four basis points to 3.24 percent as
of 4:55 p.m. in London. It climbed to 3.33 percent yesterday,
the most since Jan. 14, 2010. The 2.5 percent security due
January 2021 rose 0.35, or 3.5 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,352)
face amount, to 93.93. The two-year note yield was three basis
points lower at 1.38 percent.  ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  signaled on Feb. 3 that
there’s no immediate need to raise interest rates even with
inflation seen remaining above the bank’s 2 percent ceiling for
most of 2011. The Frankfurt-based central bank in December
forecast inflation to average about 1.8 percent this year and
1.5 percent in 2012. It will publish new projections on March 3.  Bond Auctions  Gilts jumped and the pound fell today after the  Bank of
England  said U.K. consumer-price growth will likely fall to less
than its 2 percent target in two years. The yield on the 10-year
bond fell two basis points to 3.79 percent. Sterling weakened
0.7 percent against the euro.  Germany sold 3.37 billion euros of the 2.5 percent
securities at an average yield of 3.28 percent, the Bundesbank
said today. Portugal auctioned 1 billion euros of 12-month bills
at an average yield of 3.987 percent, the country’s debt
management agency said. That compares with a yield of 3.71
percent at a previous auction of similar-maturity bills on Feb.
2. The auction attracted bids for 1.9 times the amount offered,
compared with a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.6 in the Feb. 2 sale.  “Although demand fell, the yield was not as high as the
market was expecting, which is positive for the state,” Filipe Silva, who manages 60 million euros at Banco Carregosa SA in
Oporto,  Portugal , said referring to the bill sale.  ‘Correctly Anchored’  Euribor futures rose, pushing the implied yield on the
contract expiring in December down almost four basis points to
1.87 percent. Falling yields signal that investors have reduced
bets that the ECB will increase borrowing costs. The yield has
decreased from 1.96 percent a week ago.  “Until now, inflation expectations are correctly anchored
and the feeling is that inflation will progressively decelerate
in the second half of the year,” Quaden, who heads  Belgium ’s
central bank, said at a press conference on Feb. 14 in Brussels.
His comments were embargoed until today.  Irish 10-year government bonds snapped a nine-day slide,
pushing the yield down by three basis points to 9.21 percent.
The yield climbed 41 basis points during the run of declines.
Two-year Irish notes fell for a third day, driving the yield up
eight basis points to 7.23 percent. Portugal’s 10-year yield
fell one basis point to 7.40 percent, the Greek yield rose six
basis points to 11.86 percent and the equivalent-maturity
Spanish yield declined eight basis points to 5.34 percent.  Portugal’s debt agency said it bought back 190 million
euros of notes due in April and 25 million euros of debt due in
June. Following those purchases, the outstanding amounts of
these securities was 4.34 billion euros for the bonds due in
April and 4.93 billion euros for the bonds due in June, it said.  German  government bonds  lost investors 2 percent this year,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Greek debt returned
investors 3.5 percent, with Spanish bonds gaining 1.1 percent,
the indexes show. Gilts declined 2.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
