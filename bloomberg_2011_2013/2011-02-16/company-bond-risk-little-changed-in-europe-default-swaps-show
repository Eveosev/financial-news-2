The cost of insuring against default
on European corporate bonds fell, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 9 basis
points to 393, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 3 p.m. in
London. The index is a benchmark for the cost of protecting
bonds against default and a decline signals improvement in
perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 1.25 basis points to 96.5. The
Markit iTraxx Financial Index of 25 banks and insurers declined
5 to 161 and the subordinated index was 9 lower at 277.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments was unchanged at 177.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.5 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
