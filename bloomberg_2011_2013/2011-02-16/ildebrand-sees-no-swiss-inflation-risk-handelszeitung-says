Price stability in  Switzerland  is
“not an issue,” Swiss central bank President Philipp Hildebrand told Handelszeitung in an interview.  “In the euro-zone, inflation is slightly above 2
percent,” Hildebrand said in the pre-release of an interview
the newspaper will publish tomorrow. “Our situation is
comparatively comfortable.”  A move to raise interest rates could prove “problematic”
if the global economy weakened while the Swiss franc continued
to strengthen, Hildebrand said. “From a Swiss viewpoint, that
would be a lethal combination,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
