Carlos Mario Giraldo, chief
operating officer of  Almacenes Exito SA ,  Colombia ’s largest
publicly-traded retailer, said a spike in domestic food prices
caused by flooding in the country will have no “material
impact” on the company’s results.  Giraldo spoke in an interview today at the New York Stock
Exchange. Exito is based in Medellin, Colombia.  On inflation impact:  “For the moment we have not felt massive price increases.
Obviously we’re going to have some impact, in fact we have seen
it in the last months.”  “There has been higher inflation coming from food products
in December and January, we don’t see it as a permanent
phenomenon.”  “There are two kinds of impacts, one coming from the
international commodity prices, we are definitely not being
excluded from that. But there’s another coming from the
Colombian fresh food prices after the deep rainy season we had.
That one is short-term, because fresh products have a short-term
cycle and supply will improve rapidly, starting in the second
quarter.”  “Normally what happens is the suppliers are also cautious
about price transference in order to not to affect volumes, and
so are we.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
