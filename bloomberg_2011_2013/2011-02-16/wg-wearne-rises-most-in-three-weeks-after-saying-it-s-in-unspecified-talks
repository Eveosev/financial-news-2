WG Wearne Ltd., the South African
concrete maker, gained the most in three weeks after saying it
is in unspecified talks, a day after it said it applied to the
High Court to seek a moratorium on debt repayments.  The stock added 3 cents, or 16.7 percent, its biggest
intraday jump since Jan. 27, to 21 cents as of 9:19 a.m. in
Johannesburg. The shares fell 18.2 percent yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
