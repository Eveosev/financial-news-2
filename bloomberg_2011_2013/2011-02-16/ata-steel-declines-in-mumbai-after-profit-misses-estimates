  Tata Steel Ltd .,  India â€™s biggest
producer of the alloy, fell in Mumbai trading after reporting
third-quarter group profit that missed analyst estimates because
of higher raw material costs at its European unit.  The shares declined as much as 4.3 percent to 590.10 rupees
and traded at 607.25 rupees as of 9:16 a.m. local time. The
benchmark Sensitive Index of the Bombay Stock Exchange gained
0.1 percent.  Net income, including that of unit Tata Steel Europe Ltd.,
surged to 10.03 billion rupees ($220 million) in the three
months ended Dec. 31 from 4.73 billion rupees a year ago, the
Mumbai-based company said yesterday in a statement after the
market closed. The median estimate of 20 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey was 10.7 billion rupees. Sales rose 10 percent to 286.1
billion rupees.  Tata Steel  Europe , which contributes more than two-thirds
of group production and owns no coal or iron ore mine, paid
about 62 percent more for coking coal and almost double for iron
ore in the quarter, based on benchmark prices. The Indian unit
gets all of its  iron ore  and about half of its coal needs from
its own mines.  The cost of raw materials at Tata Steel Europe increased by
more than $150 a ton in the quarter from a year earlier, Chief
Financial Officer Koushik Chatterjee said yesterday at a media
briefing in Mumbai, without giving percentage figures. Coal spot
prices may continue to rise this year after floods in  Australia 
lowered supplies and as demand gains in China and India,
researcher McCloskey Group Ltd. said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
