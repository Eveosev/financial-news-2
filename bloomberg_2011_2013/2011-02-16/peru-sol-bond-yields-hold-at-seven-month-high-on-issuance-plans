Peruvian sol bond yields held at a
seven-month high after the government announced plans to issue
as much as 3.56 billion soles ($1.29 billion) of bonds in the
domestic market this year.  The yield on  Peru ’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 was unchanged from yesterday at 6.10
percent at 12:11 p.m. in  New York , the highest level since July
8, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  The bond’s yield jumped the most in three months yesterday
after the  Finance Ministry  said it will issue 1 billion soles of
new bonds this year and enlarge existing bonds due 2015, 2031
and 2042. The new issuance may lead offshore investors, who hold
43 percent of local bonds, to sell longer dated debt in order to
buy shorter maturing bonds, said Manuel Aldave, head of
investments at Banco Internacional del Peru, the nation’s
fourth-largest bank.  “The market wasn’t expecting the government to sell 3.5
billion soles or that there would be new points in the yield
curve,” Aldave said. “Yields may rise another five or 10 basis
points because of the increase in the outstanding” debt, he
said.  The new bonds will provide benchmarks for local issuers and
increase liquidity in the local market, the ministry said. The
government may also issue debt to pre-finance the 2012 budget,
it said.  The sol gained 0.1 percent to 2.7670 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.7700 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
