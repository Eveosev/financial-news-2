Groupama SA, a French customer-owned
insurer, said it arranged a 1 billion-euro ($1.4 billion)  credit
line  to replace a facility due later this year.  The company “took advantage of the favorable market” to
seek new financing 10 months before existing arrangements
expired, Chief Financial and Risk Officer Christian Collin said
in an earnings presentation today. The oversubscription, or
amount of surplus orders, was almost two times, he said.  Groupama agreed to pay an initial interest margin of 50
basis points more than the euro interbank offered rate for the
five-year revolving credit, Groupama spokeswoman Aneta Lazarevic
said in an e-mail. The facility of the same amount it will
replace matures on Dec. 31, 2011, according to the presentation.  Lenders have cut the average interest they charge borrowers
rated A- and higher to 40 basis points over benchmark lending
rates this year from 73.4 basis points in the second half of
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Credit Agricole CIB, HSBC Holdings Plc, Natixis, Societe
Generale SA, and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc arranged the
new credit line, Lazarevic said.  Standard & Poor’s and  Fitch Ratings  rank the Paris-based
insurer’s debt A-.  To contact the reporter on this story:
