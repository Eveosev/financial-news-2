Japanese  stock futures  and
Australian shares rose as a higher forecast for economic growth
from the  Federal Reserve , improving U.S. earnings and takeovers
bolstered confidence in an economic recovery.  American depositary receipts of Honda Motor Co., which is
Japan’s second-largest carmaker and counts  North America  as its
biggest market, climbed 1.3 percent from the closing share price
in Tokyo. Those of Nomura Holdings Inc., Japan’s largest
brokerage, advanced 0.8 percent. Qantas Airways Ltd.,
Australia’s biggest airline, gained 2.9 percent in Sydney today
after reporting profit that more than quadrupled.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225  Stock Average expiring in
March closed at 10,865 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
10,800 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
10,860 in  Osaka  at 8:05 a.m. local time today. Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index climbed 0.2
percent today.  “Economic sentiment is improving and that is supporting
the stock market,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about
$450 million in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co.
“Investors expecting stocks to rise further are increasing”
because of positive economic data and strong corporate earnings.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The index rose 0.6 percent yesterday in New York
to a 32-month high following the Fed’s forecast for economic
growth, improving earnings and takeovers.  Fed Minutes  Officials “continued to express disappointment in both the
pace and the unevenness of the improvements in labor markets,”
while also judging the recovery to be on a “firmer footing,”
the  Federal Open Market Committee  said in minutes of its Jan.
25-26 meeting, released today in  Washington . Policy makers
raised projections for economic growth this year and made little
change to forecasts after 2011 or for unemployment and inflation.  Commerce Department figures showed that housing starts
climbed 15 percent to a 596,000 annual rate. The median forecast
in a Bloomberg News survey called for a 539,000 rate. Work
started on 78 percent more dwellings with two or more units,
overshadowing a drop in single-family houses that indicates the
housing market continues to struggle.  “An improvement in the housing market and  consumer
spending  is a first step to a self-sustaining recovery,”
Ichiyoshi Investment Management’s Akino said.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index increased 0.2 percent this year
to yesterday, compared with gains of 6.3 percent by the S&P 500
and 5.4 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 14.1 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.9 times for the S&P 500 and 11.5 times
for the Stoxx 600.  Crude oil for March delivery rose 0.8 percent to settle at
$84.99 a barrel in  New York  yesterday.  Of the 453 companies in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index that
have reported results since Jan. 1 for the latest quarter, 177
have exceeded analysts’ estimates, while 138 have missed them,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
