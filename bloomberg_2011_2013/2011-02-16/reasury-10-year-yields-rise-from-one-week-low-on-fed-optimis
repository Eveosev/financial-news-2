Treasury 10-year note yields rose
from the lowest level in more than a week as minutes of the  Federal Reserve ’s meeting last month showed policy makers
regarded the U.S. recovery as being on a “firmer footing.”  The benchmark yields erased their drop as the central bank
took a more optimistic view of the economy at its Jan. 25-26
meeting while maintaining dissatisfaction with job growth. The
yields fell earlier as  Israel  said two Iranian gunboats were
planning to move through the  Suez Canal  to  Syria .  “The Fed’s improved outlook for the economy has caught the
market’s attention, causing Treasuries to fall a bit despite a
relatively unchanged view on employment and inflation,” said  Kevin Flanagan , a fixed-income strategist at Morgan Stanley
Smith Barney in Purchase, New York. “With the market trying to
determine the exit strategy from the Fed, any noted improvement
is going to catch the market’s eye.”  Yields on U.S. 10-year notes increased two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 3.62 percent at 5:02 p.m. in  New York ,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 3.625
percent security maturing in February 2021 dropped 4/32, or
$1.25 per $1,000 face amount, to 100.  The 10-year note yields earlier touched 3.57 percent, the
lowest level since Feb. 4. Two-year note yields gained one basis
point to 0.83 percent after touching 0.88 percent yesterday, the
highest level since May 13.  Treasuries have handed investors a loss of 1.2 percent this
year after a gain of 5.9 percent in 2010, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch data.  Fed Economic Outlook  Fed policy makers raised projections for economic growth
this year and made little change to forecasts after 2011 or for
unemployment and inflation.  They were divided about whether further evidence of a
strengthening recovery would warrant slowing or reducing the
$600 billion of Treasury purchases, and the report doesn’t
discuss what the Fed may do after completing the bond buying.  The Fed bought $1.9 billion of Treasuries maturing from May
2021 to November 2027 today. So far, the central bank has
purchased $338.2 billion of debt under the policy known as
quantitative easing.  Central bankers projected U.S. inflation-adjusted gross
domestic product will rise 3.4 percent to 3.9 percent, compared
with November forecasts of 3 percent to 3.6 percent, as
household spending picked up and recent economic data showed a
“stronger tenor.”  Budget Deficits  The debt-buying has boosted demand for Treasuries as
President Barack Obama’s budget deficits exceed $1 trillion,
adding to the nation’s $8.96 trillion in marketable debt.
Investors bid $3.04 for each dollar of bonds sold in the
government’s $178 billion of auctions last month, the most since
September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Fed’s preferred price index, excluding food and energy,
is projected by policy makers to rise 1 percent to 1.3 percent
in 2011 and 1 percent to 1.5 percent in 2012. That compares with
November’s estimates for  core inflation  of 0.9 percent to 1.6
percent this year and 1 percent to 1.6 percent in 2012.  Consumer prices increased 0.3 percent in January after a
revised 0.4 percent gain in December, according to the median
forecast of 79 economists in a Bloomberg News survey before
tomorrow’s report from the Labor Department. Core inflation,
excluding food and energy, rose 0.9 percent on an annual basis,
the survey found.  ‘Upside Risk’  “People are focused on tomorrow’s CPI with a lot of people
seeing upside risk giving that the economy is improving,” said  Carl Lantz , head of interest-rate strategy in New York at Credit
Suisse Group AG, one of 20 primary dealers that trade directly
with the Fed.  The difference between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices over the life of the securities, narrowed to
2.27 percentage points today. The spread fell to a 15-month low
of 1.47 percent in August.  Yields on 10-year notes have risen in each of the past five
months, the longest stretch of monthly increases since 2006, on
evidence the U.S. recovery is gaining momentum.  Housing starts climbed 15 percent in January to a 596,000
annual rate, Commerce Department figures showed today. The
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey called for a 539,000
rate. Work started on 78 percent more dwellings with two or more
units, overshadowing a drop in single-family houses that
indicates the housing market continues to struggle.  “The morning’s data was bearish for the Treasury market,
though we are not selling off as much as one would expect,”
said  Ian Lyngen , a government bond strategist at CRT Capital
Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The bearish momentum has
run its course to some extent, and the market is consolidating
and looking for motivation to break out in one direction or the
other.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
