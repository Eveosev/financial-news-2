CastleOak Securities LP,  an
investment bank backed by bond broker Cantor Fitzgerald LP, has
created a municipal team by hiring six sales and trading staff
from SBK-Brooks Investment Corp.  The addition is part of the New York-based minority-owned
firm’s expansion plan that will double the number of employees
to about 90 in the next 12-18 months, said Chief Executive
Officer  David Jones .  “We are in growth mode,” said Jones, 46, in a telephone
interview. With towns going through restructurings, “we see a
lot of opportunity in the muni area.”  The new group is headed by Eric Small as senior managing
director. Nick Potonak and William Matlock have been named
managing directors, Matthew Middendorf and Gregory Reynolds as
directors and Jonathan Ly as the group’s financial analyst.  The new hires will be based in Cleveland and Columbus in
Ohio, as well as in Chicago and Indianapolis.  New York-based Cantor is transforming itself into a full-
service investment bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Matt Robinson  in New York at
