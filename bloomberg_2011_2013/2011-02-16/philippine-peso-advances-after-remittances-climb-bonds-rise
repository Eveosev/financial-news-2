The  Philippine peso  advanced after
data showed yesterday overseas workers sent more money home in
December from a year earlier. The government’s benchmark bonds
rose for the first time in six days.  Remittances from Filipinos living abroad climbed 8.1
percent to $1.69 billion and totaled a record $18.8 billion in
2010, according to a central bank report. The peso has
strengthened 1.6 percent this month, the second-best performance
among  Asia ’s 10 most-traded currencies, as official data on Feb.
10 showed export growth accelerated to 25.3 percent in December
from 11.5 percent a month earlier.  “The country’s main dollar earners will be remittances and
exports,” said  Jonathan Ravelas , a strategist at Banco De Oro
Unibank in  Manila . “We’re looking at close to 9 percent growth
for remittances for this year alone.”  The peso rose 0.2 percent to 43.595 per dollar as of 4:00
p.m. in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. Ravelas
predicts the currency will appreciate to 41 by the end of this
year.  The yield on the 7 percent bond due January 2016 dropped
7.5 basis points to 6.175 percent, according to Tradition
Financial Services. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The  Philippines  may raise about 50 billion pesos ($1.1
billion) from a sale of five- and 10-year notes targeted at
individual investors, Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima said
today.  To contact the reporter for this story:
