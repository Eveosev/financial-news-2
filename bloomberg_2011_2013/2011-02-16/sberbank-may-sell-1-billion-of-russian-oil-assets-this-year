OOO Sberbank Capital,  a unit of
Russia’s largest lender, plans to sell its Dulisma oilfield in
eastern Siberia and 35.5 percent of the Taas-Yuriakh venture
this year, General Director Ashot Khachaturyants said.  Dulisma is valued at $300 million, while the whole Taas-
Yuriakh venture is valued at $1.5 billion to $2 billion,
Khachaturyants said today in Moscow. OAO Bashneft expressed
interest in the assets, he said.  OAO Sberbank took over the fields as settlement of $630
million in debt from  Urals Energy Plc . Urals had planned to
produce 75,000 barrels of oil a day from its share in the two
assets by 2013.  Russian billionaire  Vladimir Yevtushenkov ’s holding company
AFK Sistema, which controls Bashneft, sees no forthcoming deal
with Sberbank on the assets, the Moscow-based company’s press
service said in an e-mail. Sistema is interested in buying new
deposits, according to the statement.  Dulisma holds 464 million barrels of proven and probable
reserves and was scheduled to produce 30,000 barrels a day this
year, Urals Energy said in a January 2008  release . The company
also estimated that its stake in Taas Yuriakh brought it 272
million barrels of proven and probable reserves and targeted
45,000 barrels a day in output from its share by 2013.  The fields are near Russia’s East Siberian Pacific Ocean
pipeline, which is being expanded from a point near the Chinese
border to the Pacific port of Kozmino.  Russia  began supplying
China with 300,000 barrels a day of oil this year via the link
and  China  last year asked when supplies could be doubled.  Oil produced from fields in East Siberia is also eligible
for tax exemptions as Russia seeks to develop the remote region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
