  Pacific Century Premium Developments
Ltd ., a company of Hong Kong billionaire Richard Li, rose the
most in 11 months in  Hong Kong  trading after Mingpao reported
the developer plans to sell its Beijing property.  The company planned to sell its Pacific Century Place, an
office and commercial complex, located in downtown Beijing’s San
Litun area, for at least 4 billion yuan ($608 million), the Hong
Kong newspaper reported, citing unidentified sources. The deal
is a close-end tender, and many Chinese and Hong Kong developers
showed their interests, the newspaper said.  The stock surged 16 percent to HK$1.68, the biggest gain
since March 10 last year, as of 12:28 p.m. on the city’s stock
exchange.  “The market might be excited about the deal, and expects a
cash distribution after the sales,” said Marco Mak, a Hong
Kong-based property analyst for Haitong International Securities
Group Ltd.  Alfred Siu, a spokesman for Pacific Century in Hong Kong,
declined to comment on the report.  Pacific Century is a property unit of  PCCW Ltd ., Hong
Kong’s biggest phone company. Pacific Century Place was valued
about HK$4.4 billion ($564 million) at the end of June, the
newspaper said.  --Bonnie Cao. With assistance from Kelvin Wong. Editors: Malcolm Scott, Linus Chua  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
