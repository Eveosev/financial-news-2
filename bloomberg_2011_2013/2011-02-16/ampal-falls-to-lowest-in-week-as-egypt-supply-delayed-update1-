  Ampal-American Israel  Corp. fell to
the lowest level in more than a week after the owner of a 12.5
percent stake in East Mediterranean Gas Co. said the resumption
of gas supply to EMG and its Israeli clients will be delayed.  Ampal retreated 2.3 percent to 7.525 shekels at the 4:30
p.m. close in  Tel Aviv , the lowest since Feb. 6. The shares have
declined 22 percent since Jan. 25 when political unrest in Egypt
sparked concern the company would have trouble meeting
contractual obligations to Israeli consumers.  Egyptian natural gas exports to Israel and Jordan were
halted on Feb. 5 after an explosion damaged a pipeline in the
Sinai Desert. Ampal said last week supply would resume tomorrow.  Israeli gas explorers with interests in the countryâ€™s Yam
Tethys project and Tamar field advanced. Avner Oil Exploration-
LP gained 3.1 percent to 2.36 shekels,  Delek Group Ltd .
increased 3.9 percent to 889.10 shekels and Isramco Negev 2 LP
climbed 3.7 percent to 0.395 shekel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
