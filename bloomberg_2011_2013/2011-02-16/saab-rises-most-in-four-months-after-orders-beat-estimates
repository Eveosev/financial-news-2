  Saab AB , the Swedish maker of the
Gripen jet fighter, rose the most in more than four months after
the value of new orders in the fourth quarter beat analysts’
estimates.  “The order intake was better than expected, which bodes
well,” Mats Liss, an analyst at Swedbank Markets who recommends
investors buy Saab shares, said by phone.  Saab today said it received orders worth 11.9 billion
kronor ($1.84 billion) in the quarter, up 69 percent from a year
earlier. Most analysts had estimated less than 10 billion
kronor, and Liss expected between 8 billion and 9 billion
kronor, he said. Saab said the improvement stemmed from an
increase in large orders, including one for an airborne
surveillance system, and an order for six Gripen for  Thailand .  The shares jumped as much as 7.3 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since Oct. 4, and were up 4.2 percent at 119.8
kronor as of 9:39 a.m. local time in  Stockholm .  Saab’s fourth-quarter net income fell to 8 million kronor
from 331 million kronor a year earlier. Profit was depressed by
519 million kronor in restructuring costs in the quarter, partly
related to Chief Executive Officer Hakan Buskhe’s decision in
November to give notice to more than 200 employees and close the
Dynamics business unit plant in Eskilstuna,  Sweden , as part of
his effort to lower costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
