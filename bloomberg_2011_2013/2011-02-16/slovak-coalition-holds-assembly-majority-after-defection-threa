Slovakia’s ruling coalition kept a
majority in parliament less than a year after the elections as
three deputies decided to stay in the Freedom and Solidarity
party.
　　The three deputies will continue to support the government’s
plan to reduce budget deficit, Jozef Viskupic, one of the
lawmakers in question, told journalists in Bratislava, Slovakia.
　　The possible defection would have hurt Radicova’s plan to
reduce the  budget deficit  below the European Union’s 3 percent
of gross domestic product limit by 2013. Radicova in July
replaced Robert Fico, under whose rule the shortfall swelled to
8 percent of gross domestic product as the global economic
crisis put the economy into recession.  To contact the reporter on this story: Radoslav Tomek in
