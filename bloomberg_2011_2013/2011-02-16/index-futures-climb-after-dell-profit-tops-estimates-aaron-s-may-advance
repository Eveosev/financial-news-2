U.S. stocks gained, pushing the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to a 32-month high, as a higher
forecast for economic growth from the  Federal Reserve , improving
earnings and takeovers bolstered confidence in equities.    Dell Inc . surged 12 percent, the most since December 2008,
as earnings beat analysts’ estimates on business spending.  Deere
& Co . gained 2.4 percent to a record after boosting its full-
year profit forecast.  Genzyme Corp . rose 1.1 percent as Sanofi-
Aventis SA agreed to buy the company for $20.1 billion and  Family Dollar Stores Inc . soared 21 percent as Nelson Peltz
offered to acquire the retailer for as much as $7.6 billion.  The S&P 500 rose 0.6 percent to 1,336.32 at 4 p.m. in New
York, the fourth gain in five days. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  rallied 61.53 points, or 0.5 percent, to 12,288.17. The  Nasdaq Composite Index  added 0.8 percent to 2,825.56, while the
Russell 2000 Index climbed 1 percent to 828.37. Both gauges rose
to the highest level since October 2007.  “The more optimistic view of the Federal Reserve is
confirmed in part by the financial performance of major U.S.
corporations,” said Richard Skaggs, senior equity strategist at
Loomis Sayles & Co. in  Boston , which manages $152 billion.
“Frankly we’re encouraged to see the Fed take note of the
improvement that is seen in some quarters.”  The S&P 500 has gained 6.3 percent this year, adding to
2010’s 13 percent rally, amid government stimulus measures and
higher-than-estimated corporate profits. The gauge needs to rise
1.3 percent to 1,353.06 in order to complete a 100 percent rally
from its 12-year low in March 2009. Earnings topped estimates at
72 percent of the 371 companies in the  S&P 500  that reported
since Jan. 10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Fed Meeting  Stocks extended gains today after minutes from the Fed’s
last policy meeting showed officials “continued to express
disappointment in both the pace and the unevenness of the
improvements in labor markets,” while also judging the recovery
to be on a “firmer footing.” Policy makers raised projections
for economic growth this year and made little change to
forecasts after 2011 or for unemployment and inflation.  Stock-index futures rose before the open of exchanges as
Commerce Department figures showed that housing starts climbed
15 percent to a 596,000 annual rate. The median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey called for a 539,000 rate. Work started on
78 percent more dwellings with two or more units, overshadowing
a drop in single-family houses that indicates the housing market
continues to struggle.  An index of homebuilders in S&P indexes rose 1.7 percent as
all of its 12 members rallied.  KB Home  advanced 2.1 percent to
$14.64.  Lennar Corp . climbed 1.9 percent to $20.85.  Wholesale Costs  “How can we not see confidence from investors and
companies?” said  Philip Orlando , the New York-based chief
equity market strategist at Federated Investors Inc., which
manages $341.3 billion. “We saw improvement in the housing
area,” he said. “Dell blew out their numbers last night, which
tells me we’ll have a powerful increase in technology spending.
Companies have pristine balance sheets and are flush with cash.
That should allow for more mergers and acquisitions.”  The S&P 500 pared a gain of as much as 0.7 percent after
Israeli Foreign Minister  Avigdor Lieberman  said in a speech
today that two Iranian gunboats are planning to sail tonight to  Syria  through  Egypt ’s Suez Canal. Lieberman’s comments were sent
by his office in an e-mailed statement. Ahmed El Manakhly, head
of traffic at the canal, said he had heard of no such plans.  Dell, Deere  Dell rose 12 percent to $15.56. The world’s third-largest
personal-computer maker reported fourth-quarter profit excluding
some costs of 53 cents a share, exceeding by 44 percent the
average of estimates from analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Deere gained 2.4 percent to $95.86. The world’s largest
farm-equipment maker forecast 2011 net income of $2.5 billion in
the year ending Oct. 31, a 19 percent increase from the
company’s previous estimate in November.  Genzyme rose 1.1 percent to $75.10. Sanofi-Aventis agreed
to buy the company to add treatments for rare diseases.
Genzyme’s stockholders will get $74 a share in cash. They also
will receive so-called contingent value rights that entitle them
to payments of as much as $14 a share depending on the
performance of Genzyme’s experimental multiple-sclerosis drug
Lemtrada and production levels of two of the company’s other
products, the company said.  Family Dollar Stores soared 21 percent, its biggest gain
since at least 1980, to $53.25.  Nelson Peltz ’s Trian Group
offered to acquire the second-biggest dollar-store chain in the
U.S. for $55 to $60 a share, according to a regulatory filing.  Cash at Work  Corporate America is putting its cash hoard back to work.
In the first decline since mid-2009, S&P 500 companies reduced
cash and short-term investments to $2.4 trillion from a record
$2.46 trillion, according to data Bloomberg compiled from the
most recent quarterly reports.  Capital spending  increased $22.3
billion, the biggest quarter-to-quarter jump since the end of
2004, to $142.8 billion, the highest level in two years.  Companies held their cash partly on concern that health-
care mandates and increased financial regulation would add
costs, said Barry Knapp, chief equity strategist for Barclays
Plc in  New York . Elections in November, in which Republicans won
back a majority in the  House of Representatives  and gained seats
in the Senate, have changed the climate for business, he said.  “Corporate America now views that there’s a check on the
progressive policies of the last couple of years,” Knapp said.
“Business confidence has improved, and that’s contributed to
some increased risk appetite.”  Investors put more money into U.S. domestic-equity mutual
funds last week than they have in almost two years as the S&P
500 rallied to a 32-month high. Domestic-stock funds took in
$4.92 billion in the week ended Feb. 9, according to an e-mailed
statement today from the  Investment Company Institute , a
Washington-based trade group. The last time the weekly deposits
were higher was in May 2009, ICI data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
