  Komercni Banka AS , the Czech unit of
Societe Generale, said 2010 fourth quarter profit rose 31
percent as the economic recovery fueled lending, allowing it to
propose a record dividend.  Net income in the three months through Dec. 31 increased to
to 3.37 billion koruna ($188 million) from 2.57 billion koruna
reported in the year-earlier period, the Prague-based bank, the
country’s third-largest, said today in a in a presentation on
its website. That beat the 3.13 billion koruna average estimate
by nine analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  The bank’s board will propose a record dividend of 270
koruna per share, up from 170 koruna last year. The bank plans
to make a “significant” investment into its branch network and
increase lending, particularly in mortgages, this year,
according to the statement.  “The economic recovery in late 2010 generated new business
opportunities, in particular in the area of lending,” Chief
Executive Officer Henri Bonnet said in the statement.  Net banking income during the period rose 2.5 percent to
8.37 billion koruna and net interest income advanced 3.3 percent
to 5.5 billion koruna, the bank said. Total loan exposure rose
2.8 percent to 400 billion koruna while the share of standard
and watch loan exposure remained unchanged from the previous
quarter at 93.5 percent.    Societe Generale  SA,  France ’s second-largest lender which
owns over 60 percent of Komercni Banka, reported today that
fourth-quarter profit quadrupled to 874 million euros thanks to
a turnaround at its Russian unit and fewer writedowns.  Net income for the full year at Komercni Banka reached 13.3
billion koruna, exceeding the Bloomberg survey that expected
profit of 12.8 billion koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
