China will streamline its rare earth
industry over five years, state-run Xinhua News Agency  said ,
citing Premier  Wen Jiabao .  China will take “stricter” measures to control mining of
rare earths and lift environmental standards, while continuing
to cap production and exports with the quota system, Xinhua said,
citing Wen.  China controls more than 95 percent of the world’s supply
of rare earths, a group of 17 chemically similar elements used
in hybrid cars, iPods and weapons. The country’s policy of
slashing exports of the metals soured ties with major users
including the U.S. and Japan, and caused prices to surge.  China will promote new technology in the industry as well
as mergers and acquisitions among companies, Xinhua cited Wen as
saying. Wen made the speech at a State Council meeting today.  New regulations will be issued to strengthen management in
the rare earth industry and control the scale of mines,  China 
Securities Journal reported today, citing an unidentified person.  The rules will address mining activity, smelting and
processing companies, and exporters, according to the report.
China will encourage the development of large rare earth
companies, the report said.  The regulations include higher standards for resource
utilization, stricter rules on environmental protection and the
use of advanced technology, it said.  The report didn’t say when
the new policy will be announced.  --Xiao Yu. Editors: Alan Soughley, Indranil Ghosh  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
