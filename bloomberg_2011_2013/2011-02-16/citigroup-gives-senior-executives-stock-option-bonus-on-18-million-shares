  Citigroup Inc ., the third-largest  U.S. bank  by assets, granted 15 executives options on
18.2 million shares as part of their 2010 pay, according to
filings.  Chief Operating Officer  John Havens , 54, and the head of  consumer banking  for the Americas, Manuel Medina-Mora, 60,
received 2 million shares each. Chief Financial Officer  John Gerspach , 57, received 1.5 million shares, as did Michael Corbat, 50, head of Citi Holdings. The New York-based bank
didn’t put a value on the awards. Chief Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit , 54, declined a 2010 bonus.  Banks are under pressure to curb bonuses after receiving
taxpayer-funded bailouts during the financial crisis of 2008.
Citigroup received a $45 billion bailout, some of which the  U.S.
Treasury  converted into a stake in the lender last year. The
government sold off its stake in December, realizing a profit of
about $12 billion for taxpayers.  “These option awards, which are meant to incent and retain
our management team, further align Citi’s compensation with the
long-term performance of the company,” said Anu Ahluwalia, a
Citigroup spokeswoman.  The options vest in three equal annual installments
beginning Feb. 14, 2012 and can be exercised at $4.91 a share,
according to the filings. They expire in February 2017.  Citigroup shares fell 1 cent to $4.90 in 4:15 p.m. New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares climbed 43 percent
last year.  Options give the holder the right, but not the obligation,
to purchase shares at a preset price for a specific period.
Holders can profit if the shares rise above the exercise price.  Citigroup last month awarded separate stock bonuses for
executives valued at almost $50 million. Six, including Havens,
Medina-Mora and Gerspach, also shared “stock salary” last year
valued at more than $37 million on an annualized basis,
according to a Sep. 24 filing. The bank also awarded CEO Pandit
an annual salary of $1.75 million for 2011. Pandit had taken
home $1 a year since February 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
