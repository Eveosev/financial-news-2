Copper fell for a second day on
concern that record prices and the prospect of more tightening
measures by  China , the largest user, may hurt demand. Lead and
nickel also declined.  Three-month delivery copper on the London Metal Exchange
lost as much as 1.3 percent to $9,886 a metric ton and was at
$9,959 by 3:06 p.m. Shanghai time. The price climbed to a record
$10,190 a ton yesterday before closing 1.5 percent lower.  “We need to wait and see whether China will return to the
market in March and April amid record prices,” Wang Mingyi, an
analyst at Galaxy Futures Co., said from Beijing. “This is even
more important than the general U.S. and China economic data.”  In the U.S., sales at retailers rose 0.3 percent last
month, the Commerce Department said yesterday. That’s less than
the 0.5 percent median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists. The December gain was revised to 0.5 percent from
0.6 percent.  China’s consumer price index gained 4.9 percent in January
from a year earlier, according to the National Bureau of
Statistics. That compares with a 4.6 percent rise in December
and a median forecast of 5.4 percent in a Bloomberg News survey.  Economists, including Liu Li-gang of  Australia  & New
Zealand Banking Group, expect more monetary tightening after the
People’s Bank of China raised  interest rates  last week for the
third time in four months.  Copper for May delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
closed 0.6 percent lower at 75,660 yuan ($11,490) a ton.  ‘High Price’  “It may take some time for local end users to get used to
the high price, and before that they’ll probably choose to rely
on their stockpiles,” said Wang Jingjing, an analyst at Founder
Futures Co. “Coupled with the expectations of more tightening,
it remains to be seen how the demand side will perform.”    BHP Billiton Ltd ., the world’s largest mining company,
today reported record first-half profit of $10.5 billion and
committed to spending $80 billion to expand and develop copper,  iron ore , oil and coal projects. Among plans, BHP is studying an
expansion of Olympic Dam in Australia that would transform the
mine into the world’s fourth-largest copper and gold operation.  Tongling Nonferrous Metals Group Co. agreed to a 54.8
percent increase in treatment-and-refining charges with BHP for
processing copper concentrate in the first half, the smelter
said in an exchange filing.  Tongling agreed $72 per ton for treatment fees and $7.20
per pound for refining fees with the Australian company on Jan.
20. That compares with $46.50 and $4.65 for 2010, China’s
second-largest copper smelter said.  “The miners have bargaining chips, given the tight
market,” said Yang Changhua, a senior copper analyst at metals
researcher Beijing Antaike Information Development Co. The
copper price increase to a record didn’t help alleviate the
burden of smelters much, Yang said.  Lead lost 0.9 percent to $2,612 a ton, and nickel declined
0.4 percent to $28,640 a ton. Tin, which reached a record
$32,799 on Feb. 15, declined 0.3 percent to $32,400. Zinc rose
0.8 percent to $2,510.50 a ton, while aluminum was little
changed at $2,503 a ton.  -  Helen Sun . Editors:  Richard Dobson , Jarrett Banks  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
