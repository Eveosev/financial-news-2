  Electronic Arts Inc . rose to the
highest intraday level since May and options prices soared the
most since September 2009 after the company said it has a strong
slate of games coming out in the next year.  The second-largest U.S. video-game publisher gained 2.9
percent to $19.07 as of 3 p.m. in New York and earlier rose 9
percent. Implied volatility, the key gauge of option prices, for
at-the-money options expiring in 30 days jumped 23 percent to
40.42 as traders bet on larger share-price swings. Trading of
calls to buy the stock was almost quadruple the four-week
average and 2.4 times the number of puts to sell.  CEO John Riccitiello told investors at a Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. technology conference yesterday that the  Redwood
City , California-based company has a strong slate of digital and
retail games for the 2012 fiscal year and is aiming for “market
leadership” in first-person shooter games. He spoke in  San
Francisco  after U.S. markets closed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
