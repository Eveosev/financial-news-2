West Africa’s stock market, based in
Abidjan, the commercial capital of  Ivory Coast , suspended
operations “until further notice” amid security concerns,
Tiemoko Yade Coulibaly, president of the exchange, said in a
statement.  The bourse was seized by the government of Laurent Gbagbo,
who claims he won the presidency in the West African nation, on
Feb. 9, according to a separate statement e-mailed by Gbagbo
today. The BRVM’s decision to close is “void,” it added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
