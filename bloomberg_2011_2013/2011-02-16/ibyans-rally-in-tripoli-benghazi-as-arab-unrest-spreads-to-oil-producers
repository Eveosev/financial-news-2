Libyan protesters took to the
streets of Tripoli and other cities in what state television
said were “popular demonstrations” in support of leader  Muammar Qaddafi , as the unrest that ousted leaders in Egypt and
Tunisia spread to oil-producing areas of the Middle East.  Protesters in the port city of Benghazi chanted slogans
demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Baghdadi al-
Mahmoudi, the  Associated Press  said. There were no immediate
reports of demonstrations against Qaddafi, who has ruled the
North African country since coming to power in 1969 in a
military coup, the AP said. Jamahiriya state television showed
footage taken at dawn that showed dozens of people on the
streets and fireworks lighting the sky.  Popular uprisings in North  Africa  in the past two months
have toppled Tunisian leader Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and  Egypt ’s
President Hosni Mubarak, who left office on Feb. 11. The unrest
has since spread to the Persian Gulf region, the center of
Middle East oil production, renewing concern that supplies may
be disrupted.  Brent crude  climbed to a 28-month high of $104.30
on Feb. 14 as anti-government protests erupted in Iran, the
region’s second largest oil producer, and nearby Bahrain.  Libya has the largest proven oil reserves in Africa, with
44.3 billion barrels in 2009, according to the BP Statistical
Review of World Energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
