Malawi will probably keep its key
interest rate at 13 percent in order to boost economic growth,
Finance Minister Ken Kandodo told Parliament in the capital,
Lilongwe, yesterday.  “The  bank rate , which was reduced from 15 percent to 13
percent, is expected to be maintained in order to spur private
sector development,” Kandodo told lawmakers in comments shown
by the Malawi Broadcasting Corp. TV today.  Foreign exchange and fuel shortages remain a challenge,
Kandodo said. The shortages stem from increased demand for
imports of  consumer goods  and raw materials following years of
robust growth, while exports haven’t kept pace, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
