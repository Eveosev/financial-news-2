  Rogers Communications Inc .,  Canada ’s
largest wireless carrier, reported fourth-quarter profit that
missed analysts’ estimates as new carriers and rival  BCE Inc .
hurt growth in new subscribers.  Profit excluding some items was 64 Canadian cents (65
cents) a share, Toronto-based Rogers said today in a statement.
Analysts predicted 66 Canadian cents, the average of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 3.1 percent to C$3.15 billion,
missing the average analyst estimate of C$3.17 billion.  Rogers, led by Chief Executive Officer Nadir Mohamed, is
facing the threat of new carriers Wind Mobile, Mobilicity and
Public Mobile as well as a resurgent BCE. Bell, BCE’s main
consumer brand and Canada’s second-largest wireless carrier,
added 156,708 new mobile phone subscribers on contract last
quarter, a 43 percent jump from a year earlier.  “New entrants have introduced additional promotions and
continue to offer very aggressive unlimited plans to lure
customers,” Maher Yaghi, an analyst at Desjardins Securities in  Montreal , said in a research note.  Rogers today renewed its share repurchase plan for as much
as 39.8 million shares, worth up to C$1.5 billion. The company
raised its annualized dividend by 11 percent to C$1.42 a share.  Shares of Rogers rose 67 cents to C$35.39 at 4 p.m. in
Toronto Stock Exchange trading. The shares climbed 5.8 percent
last year.  2011 Outlook  Rogers’s net income climbed 5.5 percent to C$327 million,
or 58 cents a share, compared with a year earlier.  The carrier added 49,000 net new wireless subscribers on
contract last quarter. Its average wireless monthly bill for all
users fell to C$61.72, missing the C$61.90 estimate by Yaghi,
who rates Rogers “hold.”  The results “reflect the impact of increased competition
on” call revenue and the rate of customer losses, Mohamed told
analysts on a conference call. Rogers expects “continued but
moderated growth” this year, he said.  Rogers’ wireless network revenue should be C$6.53 billion
to C$6.73 billion this year compared with $6.53 billion last
year. Operating profit for the company excluding compensation
and restructuring costs will be in a range of C$4.6 billion to
C$4.77 billion compared with C$4.64 billion in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
