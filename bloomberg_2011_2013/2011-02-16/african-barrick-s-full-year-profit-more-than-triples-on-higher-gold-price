African Barrick Gold Plc, the
biggest London-listed producer of the precious metal, said full-
year profit more than tripled after gold prices gained.  Net income increased to $218.1 million from $58.6 million a
year earlier, the London-based company said today in a
statement. African Barrick is targeting production of 700,000
ounces to 760,000 ounces in 2011, it said.  Gold producers’ profits have been buoyed by prices that
rose last year as  Europe ’s sovereign-debt woes spurred demand
for precious metals as a haven. Gold for immediate delivery
averaged $1,227.22 an ounce in 2010, compared with $974.02 an
ounce in 2009, and climbed to a record $1,432.50 in December.  African Barrick, which produced 700,934 ounces of gold last
year, said revenue jumped 37 percent to $975 million. Fourth-
quarter profit was $79 million.  The company, spun off by the world’s largest gold producer
Barrick Gold Corp. last March, expects to raise annual output to
more than 1 million ounces by 2014. The company operates four
mines in  Tanzania .  To contact the reporter on this story:
