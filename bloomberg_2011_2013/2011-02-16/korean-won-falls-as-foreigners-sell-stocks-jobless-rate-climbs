  South Korea ’s won fell for the first
time in three days as overseas investors cut their holdings of
the nation’s stocks and government data showed the jobless rate
rose to a four-month high in January.  The currency fell to a one-month low last week as global
funds slashed their holdings of Korean shares by $1.6 billion
this year. It strengthened 12 percent in the last two years as
foreigners bought $44.1 billion more equities than they sold.
The  unemployment rate  rose to 3.6 percent from a revised 3.5
percent in December, Statistics Korea said today.  “The won’s decline reflects offshore players who had to
buy dollars as they are selling Korean equities,” said Jeff Kim, a currency trader at Korea Exchange Bank in  Seoul . “But I
don’t think the won will fall any further beyond 1,125 as
exporters are waiting to sell their dollars.”  The won slid 0.1 percent to 1,120.28 per dollar as of the 3
p.m. close in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Foreign investors sold more Korean stocks than they bought on
all but one of the last six days and the currency reached a one-
month low of 1,128.70 last week.  The  finance ministry  projected in December that the annual
average unemployment rate will probably fall to 3.5 percent in
2011 from 3.7 percent last year, as the nation adds 280,000
jobs.  The government’s benchmark five-year bonds were unchanged.
The yield on the 4 percent note due September 2015 was 4.45
percent, according to Korea Stock Exchange. The rate reached
4.51 percent last week, the highest level since the note began
trading in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
