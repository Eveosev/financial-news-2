(Corrects issue price in second paragraph)  MultiPlan’s $1.265 billion  term loan 
to refinance debt rose in trading, according to a person with
knowledge of the transaction.  The debt, sold to investors at par, rose to 101 cents
today, said the person who declined to be identified because the
trades are private.  Barclays Plc, Bank of America Corp. and Credit Suisse Group
AG arranged the debt, which will pay 3.25 percentage points more
than the London interbank offered rate, said the person. Libor,
the rate banks charge to lend to each other will have a 1.5
percent floor.  Lenders got one-year of 101 soft-call protection, said the
person, meaning the health-care cost-management company would
have to pay a one cent premium to reprice the debt in its first
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
