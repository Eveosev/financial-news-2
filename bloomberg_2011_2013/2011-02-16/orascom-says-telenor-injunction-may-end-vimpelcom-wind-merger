Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris’s holding company said an injunction by Norway’s  Telenor
ASA  to halt  VimpelCom Ltd .’s takeover of his phone assets may
kill the deal.  If the issue is not resolved by the end of March, the deal
may have to end, Khaled Bichara, chief executive officer of Wind
Telecom SpA, the holding company for Sawiris’s phone assets,
was quoted by Cairo-based newspaper Al Youm El Sabie as saying.
His comments were sent in an e-mail by Sawiris-controlled  Orascom Telecom Holding SAE , the biggest mobile-phone network
operator by subscribers in the Middle East.  The company “would like to end this matter quickly without
wasting any time as it has many other businesses which need its
attention,” said Bichara, who is also Orascom’s CEO.  Telenor opposes a plan by VimpelCom,  Russia ’s second-
biggest mobile-phone operator, to issue new stock representing
20 percent of shares outstanding and 31 percent of voting rights
to investors in Wind Telecom.  Telenor, a VimpelCom shareholder, asked in January for the
dispute with VimpelCom and Alfa Group, the Russian company’s
other main shareholder, to be referred to a court of
arbitration. VimpelCom shareholders are scheduled to vote March
17 on the new shares.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
