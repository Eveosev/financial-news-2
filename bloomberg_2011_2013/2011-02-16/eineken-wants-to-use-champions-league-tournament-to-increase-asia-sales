  Heineken NV , the world’s third-
largest beer maker, is looking to ride the popularity of
European soccer’s Champions League to increased sales in  Asia .  The Dutch company is looking to Asia and other emerging
markets to overcome “cautious consumer behavior” in the U.S.
and Europe, and it wants to get in front of the more than 1
billion people in the region who watch the matches, said Hans- Erik Tuijt, head of sponsorship at the Amsterdam-based drinks
company, in a speech to journalists in Nyon.  Awareness of Heineken’s brand in Asia is still
“relatively low,” Tuijt told Bloomberg News in an interview.
“As soon as customers become aware that Heineken’s the sponsor,
they get a better image of the brand.”  Heineken’s shares rose as much as 5.7 percent today as the
company’s full-year net income beat analysts’ expectations and
as spending fell more than anticipated.  Worldwide marketing and selling expenses still increased 25
percent to 2.1 billion euros in 2010, according to today’s
 earnings statement . Heineken will invite 1,100 guests to the
tournament final on May 28 in  London .  “They have a very high operating profit in Asia,” said
Ton Van Ooijen, analyst at Kepler Capital Markets in Amsterdam.  To contact the reporter on this story:
