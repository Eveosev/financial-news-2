Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac , the government-owned
mortgage companies, will not default.  “Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will not default on their
obligations,” Geithner told the House Budget Committee today in
response to a question. “It’s not going to happen.”  U.S. taxpayer aid to the companies will reach $224 billion
by the end of 2012, of which $55 billion will be returned in
dividends to the Treasury, according to President Barack Obama’s
2012 budget.  The budget reiterates several goals set out by the
administration when it offered a set of options last week for
dialing down government support for the nearly $11 trillion
mortgage market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
