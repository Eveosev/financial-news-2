The forint appreciated for a second
day and Hungarian shares advanced as speculation that economic
reports will signal a stronger global recovery increased demand
for risk.  The forint appreciated 0.2 percent to 270.81 per euro as of
9:46 a.m. in Budapest. The benchmark BUX Index of shares
increased 0.8 percent to 22,551.54, led by OTP Bank Nyrt., the
country’s largest lender, which rose 1.6 percent.  U.S. industrial production climbed for a third month,
rising 0.5 percent in January from December, according to a
Bloomberg News survey before today’s report. Separate reports on
housing starts and producer prices are also due today.  “International sentiment has improved somewhat,” Nora Kovacs, an analyst at Intesa Sanpaolo SpA’s CIB Bank unit, said
by phone from Budapest. “This afternoon’s American housing and
industrial production data may move markets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
