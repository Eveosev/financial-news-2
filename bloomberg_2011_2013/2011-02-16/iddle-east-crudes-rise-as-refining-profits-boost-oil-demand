Middle East crude oils rose compared
with their benchmark prices as refinery demand improved amid
gains in processing profits.  Murban for April loading climbed 14 cents to a premium of
11 cents a barrel to its official selling price, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Qatar Marine for the same month
increased 3 cents to a premium of 4 cents a barrel.  Refiners are seeking both types of crude as they yield a
higher amount of gasoil, or diesel, when processed. Gasoil’s
premium to benchmark Dubai, a measure of refining profit, was at
$17.96 a barrel today, according to data from PVM Oil Associates
Ltd. That’s up from its six-month average of $13.81 a barrel.  Oman oil for immediate loading fell $1.47, or 1.5 percent,
to $97.74 a barrel today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Dubai for loading in April was down $1.46 to $97.53.
Murban crude dropped 1.3 percent to $100.67.  Oman futures for April delivery gained 47 cents to $97.85 a
barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 6:59 p.m. Singapore
time, with 1,075 contracts traded. The settlement price was set
at $97.98 at 12:30 p.m. Dubai time.  The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps for April, or EFS,
narrowed 8 cents to $4.25 a barrel, according to data from PVM
Oil Associates Ltd. The exchange for swaps for May decreased 7
cents to $4.32.  To contact the reporter on this story:
