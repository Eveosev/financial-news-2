  JPMorgan Chase & Co . set out
yesterday a $500 million plan to consolidate its trading
platforms around the world, a step that could save $300 million
a year, the Financial Times reported, citing Jes Staley, who
heads the company’s investment banking unit.  Staley said at the bank’s annual investor day that as many
as 3,000 employees might be eliminated or redeployed, and total
savings might be more than $1 billion, because of lower costs
and increased efficiency, the newspaper said.  The project began two years ago, in which time the number
of trading systems has fallen from 10 to five, and the aim is to
have just two by 2014, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
