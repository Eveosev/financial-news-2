Gasoline climbed to a 28-month high
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , rising with  crude oil  and
heating oil after Israeli Foreign Minister  Avigdor Lieberman

Canal  to Syria, spurring concern that Middle Eastern oil
shipments will be disrupted. Ethanol was little changed.  “This is the latest addition to the Middle East risk
premium,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at
PFGBest in  Chicago . “This is a knee-jerk reaction to the
headlines that Iran is planning to send two warships through the
Suez Canal.”  Crude Oil  Crude oil for March delivery gained 67 cents, or 0.8
