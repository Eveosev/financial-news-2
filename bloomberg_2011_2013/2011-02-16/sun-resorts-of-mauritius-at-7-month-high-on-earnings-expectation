Sun Resorts Ltd., Mauritius’s
second-biggest hotel chain and tour operator by market
capitalization, rose to its highest in almost seven months as
investors speculated results will improve.  The stock advanced 1.5 rupees, or 2.5 percent, to 62 rupees
by 12:45 p.m in  Port Louis , the highest since July last year.  “New Mauritius Hotels and Naiade Resorts published
positive results for the quarter through December,” Vikash
Tulsidas, manager of the Port Louis-based Axys Stockbroking
Ltd., said by phone today. “Investors anticipate the same for
Sun Resorts.”  Sun Resorts will release its full-year results in March.
Its loss widened 27 percent in the third quarter through
September to 133 million rupees, the company said on Nov. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
