Peruvian sol bond yields rose to a
three-month high after the government announced it will issue
new shorter dated bonds as part of plans to sell 3.56 billion
soles ($1.29 billion) in the domestic market this year.  The yield on  Peru ’s 9.9 percent sol-denominated bond due
May 2015 rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to
4.85 percent at today’s close, the highest level since Oct. 26,
according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  The  Finance Ministry  said yesterday it will issue 1 billion
soles of a new 2013 bond this year and sell 1 billion soles to
enlarge the 2015 bond to provide benchmarks for local issuers.
The Andean nation will sell existing 2031 and 2042 bonds to
increase liquidity in the local market, the ministry said.  “The market wasn’t expecting the government to sell 3.5
billion soles or that there would be new points in the yield
curve,” said Manuel Aldave, head of investments at Banco
Internacional del Peru, the nation’s fourth-largest bank.
“Yields may rise another five or 10 basis points because of the
increase in the outstanding” debt, Aldave said.  Peru plans to 350 million soles of inflation-linked 2046
bonds and is looking at selling other financial instruments and
setting up a program to sell  government bonds  to the public, the
ministry said.  The sale of 2031 and 2042 bonds will push up yields on
later maturing bonds because investors will demand a higher rate
as the central bank raises its benchmark lending rate to slow
inflation, said Alberto Huarote, a portfolio manager at ING
Fondos SAF, a Lima-based mutual fund.  Economic growth above Peru’s potential will lead the
central bank to gradually increase the benchmark rate to a
neutral level, the ministry said.  Bets the sol will strengthen may boost foreign demand for
bonds denominated in the local currency, helping to offset the
impact of interest rate rises on the yields of later maturing
bonds, the ministry said.  The sol gained 0.1 percent to 2.7680 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.7700 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
