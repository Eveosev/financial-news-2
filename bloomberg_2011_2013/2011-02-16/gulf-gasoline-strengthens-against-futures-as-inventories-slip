Spot gasoline in the  Gulf Coast  rose
versus futures as the government reported inventories of the
fuel declined in the region.  Total gasoline stocks in the Gulf slipped 2.04 million
barrels to 79.3 million barrels last week, according to the
Energy Department. U.S. inventories of the fuel increased
205,000 barrels to 241.1 million barrels.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 0.25 cent to 4.75 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 10:44
a.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
gained 3.62 cents to $2.475 a gallon.  Plants in the Gulf contain more than 40 percent of U.S.
refining capacity. They include Motiva Enterprises LLCâ€™s
refinery in  Port Arthur , Texas, where a wet gas compressor was
shut yesterday, according to a filing with the Texas Commission
on Environmental Quality. Rates on a delayed coking unit were
reduced before the compressor was restarted, the filing showed.  Also in Port Arthur, Flint Hills Resources LLC reported
emissions at its refinery yesterday, according to a TCEQ filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
