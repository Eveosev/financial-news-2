The European Union may set aside 500
million to 800 million allowances from the 2013-2020 period of
its emissions-trading system for future investments in low-
carbon technologies, according to a draft document.  The European Commmission, the EU regulator, indicated in an
analysis in May 2010 that excess allowances in the current
phase from 2008 to 2012 would increase the total number of
permits in the third phase running through 2020, according
to the document.  “Setting aside an equivalent number of allowances during
the period 2013-2020 in phase three would restore the originally
foreseen overall allowances budget for the next decade,” said
the policy paper, which is in internal commision consultations.
“This would restore the reward for low-carbon investments,
preparing the sector for the innovations needed in a 2030
perspective.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
