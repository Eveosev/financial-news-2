Following is the text of
Canada's leading indicators report from  Statistics Canada .  The composite leading index rose 0.3% in January, after
increasing 0.4% in the previous two months. Growth again
was led by the stock market and housing. In January, 4 of
the 10 components fell, 1 less than in December.  Stock market prices trended up 2.6%, the fifth straight
monthly advance. Energy stock prices led the gain, as
mining paused after driving the rally late in 2010.  Household demand continued to expand. The housing index
rose 1.3%, its third straight gain as strength in existing
home sales outweighed a dip in housing starts. Furniture
and appliance sales edged down 0.1%, but outlays for other
durable goods increased 0.9%.  Manufacturing remained mixed. New orders fell 2.3%,
their second straight decline. The ratio of shipments to
inventories also fell for the second straight month, as
the trend for shipments dropped for the first time in over
a year. The average workweek at factories stopped
declining. The leading indicator for the  United States 
rose 0.7% in December, its largest advance in eight
months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
