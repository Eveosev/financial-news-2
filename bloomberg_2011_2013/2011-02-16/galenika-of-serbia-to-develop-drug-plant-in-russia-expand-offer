Serbia’s state-run drugmaker
 Galenika  announced plans to build a plant south of Moscow to
boost sales on the Russian market.  Construction of the 28 million-euro ($37.8 million) plant
in the city of Obninsk will begin by May and should be completed
in 18 months, said Galenika in a statement posted on its website
today. General Manager Nenad Ognjenovic signed an agreement with
the authorities in the Kaluga region.  Galenika’s exports to  Russia  stood at around $3.5 million
last year and the company expects to increase that by 50 percent
to 60 percent in 2011, “but it’s difficult to make significant
expansion without launching local production” said Zarko Ilic,
the company’s representative in Moscow, in e-mailed comments.  Russia plans to curb drug imports and establishing local
production is essential for operations on “the huge, yet very
crowded, market” where Galenika plans to expand offer, he said.  Initial output at the future plant is seen at 500 million
to 550 million pills a year with 200 workers. Later expansion
may bring as much as 40 million euros in annual net income to
Galenika, according to Ilic.  Serbia gave up plans to sell Galenika last year after two
disappointing preliminary offers. In December, the company
signed a manufacturing agreement with an  Abbott Laboratories 
subsidiary for mature products, taking over production of Brufen
and Flugalin painkillers previously made in  Greece .  To contact the reporter on this story:
