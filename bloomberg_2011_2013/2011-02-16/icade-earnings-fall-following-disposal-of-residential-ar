Icade SA, the property developer
controlled indirectly by the French state, said earnings
excluding items fell 4.9 percent last year following the sale of
its residential arm and other businesses.  Earnings excluding disposal proceeds and other one-time
items, known as net current  cash flow , dropped to 175 million
euros ($237 million), or 3.43 euros a share, the Paris-based
company said today in a statement. It earned 183.9 million euros,
or 3.77 euros a share, in 2009.  The company forecast “strong growth in current cash
flows” this year and in 2012.  Chief Executive Officer Serge Grzybowski sold most of
Icade’s residential properties for about 2 billion euros to
focus the company on more profitable commercial real estate. He
also sold buildings with no potential for increasing rents or
profits, and disposed of peripheral property management
businesses. In October, the company completed the acquisition of
Morgan Stanley’s Cie. La Lucette after a share offer.  Net income more than doubled to 1.22 billion euros, or
23.88 euros a share, from 527.1 million euros, or 10.81 euros, a
year earlier. The figure includes 1.17 billion euros in proceeds
from asset sales. Revenue fell 4.9 percent to 1.43 billion euros.  Net asset value rose 1.4 percent from June 30 to 81.4 euros
a share.  Icade  doesn’t include valuation changes to its
properties in its income and books a profit or loss only when it
sells a building.  The company said it will pay a 3.30-euro dividend in
addition to the special payout of 4 euros a share from disposal
proceeds.  The earnings were released after the close of regular
trading. Icade gained 22 cents to 82.06 euros in Paris, lifting
the company’s market value to 4.2 billion euros. About 56
percent of the shares are owned by  France ’s state-owned bank,
Caisse des Depots et Consignations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
