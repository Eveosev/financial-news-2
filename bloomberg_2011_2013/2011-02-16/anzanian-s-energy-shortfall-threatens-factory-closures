The Confederation of Tanzania
Industries said energy shortages in the East African nation may
force the closure of some factories.  Many companies may also raise prices to compensate for
increased costs, the confederation’s director of policy and
research, Hussein Kamote, said by phone today.  More than 50 companies have “been severely affected by the
ongoing power crisis, with five of them declaring their decision
to close down production if the problem persists till next
month,” Kamote said.  A drop in hydroelectric capacity due to a drought has led
to a 264-megawatt shortfall in power supplies, Energy and
Minerals Minister William Ngeleja said by phone today. Even with
adequate rainfall, the deficit would be 67 megawatts, he said.
The government has sped up development of  power plants  in  Dar es
Salaam  and Mwanza to ease the shortage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
