The Interior Department’s management
overhaul may disrupt the collection of oil royalties from energy
companies, the Government Accountability Office said today.  The department is being added to a GAO “high-risk list”
after Interior Secretary  Ken Salazar  decided to split the
management of offshore oil resources from the enforcement of
safety rules and revenue collection following BP Plc’s oil well
blast in April, the agency said.  “GAO is concerned about Interior’s ability to undertake
this reorganization while providing reasonable assurance that
billions of dollars of revenue owed to the public are being
properly assessed and collected,” the government watchdog
agency said in the  report  issued today.  President  Barack Obama  estimates that royalties paid to the
U.S. by oil and gas companies for offshore production will
increase 68 percent to $5.97 billion next year, according to his
budget released Feb. 14.  The transfer of revenue management from the agency known as
Minerals Management Service to the new Office of Natural
Resources Revenue “has taken place as planned and without
disruption,”  Kendra Barkoff , a spokeswoman for the  Department
of Interior , said in an e-mail today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
