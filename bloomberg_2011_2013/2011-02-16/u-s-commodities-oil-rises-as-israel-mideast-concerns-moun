Crude oil rose after Israeli Foreign
Minister  Avigdor Lieberman  said two Iranian gunboats are
planning to move through the  Suez Canal  to  Syria , spurring
concern that Middle Eastern petroleum shipments will be
disrupted.  Lieberman called the move he expects later today a
“provocation.” The possible action by Iran comes five days
after Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  stepped down.  Brent
crude , the European benchmark that is more sensitive to Middle
East unrest, settled at the highest level since Sept. 25, 2008.  “This is the latest addition to the Middle East risk
premium,” said  Phil Flynn , a vice president of research at
PFGBest in Chicago. “This is a knee-jerk reaction to the
headlines.”  In other markets, cotton climbed to a record on signs that
demand continued to increase in China, the world’s largest
importer, as flooding hurt crops in  Australia . Rice tumbled. The
UBS Bloomberg Constant Maturity Commodity Index advanced 0.3
percent to 1,705.79.  Oil futures for March delivery rose 67 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $84.99 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Brent for April settlement jumped $2.14, or 2.1 percent, to
$103.78 a barrel on ICE Futures  Europe .  Cotton  Cotton futures for May delivery rose by the exchange limit
of 7 cents, or 3.7 percent, to a record $1.9493 a pound on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. The price, up 16 percent this month,
has more than doubled in the past year.  China’s textile mills increased yarn output by 14 percent
to 27 million metric tons last year, a government commission
said last month.  Australia, the fourth-largest exporter, will harvest 6.2
percent less than a December estimate, a government agency said
yesterday.  “Strong buying and limited supplies is a very good
combination to push prices higher,” said Gary Raines, an
economist at FCStone Fibers & Textiles in Nashville, Tennessee.    China  imported 2.84 million tons last year, the most since
2006, according to customs figures.  Rice  Rice futures tumbled the most in eight months on
speculation that a decline in U.S. planting will be less than
analysts forecast.  Farmers may sow 3.3 million  acres  when  planting  begins in
April, down 9.4 percent from a year earlier, the  U.S. Department
of Agriculture  said on Feb. 11. Analysts anticipated a decline
of 25 percent as farmers switch to more-profitable corn,
soybeans and cotton, according to a Bloomberg News survey late
last month.  The government estimate was “not what the market was
expecting at all, and not what any of us believe will happen,”
said Dennis DeLaughter, the owner of Progressive Farm Marketing
Inc. in Edna,  Texas . “The USDA is not even close to being
right.”  Rice futures for March delivery fell 55.5 cents, or 3.6
percent, to $14.675 per 100 pounds on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade, the biggest drop since June 2. The most-active contract
has slumped 9.9 percent since Feb. 9.  Commodities settled as follows:  Precious metals:
