Japan bought 3,496 metric tons of
rice from the U.S.,  China  and Thailand today through a tender
system introduced to loosen government grain-import controls,
the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said.  Of the total, 2,596 tons were from the U.S., 560 tons were
from China and the remainder was from Thailand, the ministry
said in a statement.  The tender was held under the so-called simultaneous buy-
and-sell system in which food companies and trading houses
jointly bid for grains of any origin and quality.  Japan is self-sufficient in rice. The nation agreed to give
minimum market access to exporting countries at the  Uruguay
Round  of world trade talks in 1993, buying 770,000 tons a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
