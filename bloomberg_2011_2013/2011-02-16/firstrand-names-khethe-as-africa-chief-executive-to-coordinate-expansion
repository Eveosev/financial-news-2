  FirstRand Ltd ., the second-largest
South African banking group, said it appointed Jabu Khethe as
chief executive officer of its African unit.  Khethe was previously CEO of the African businesses of
FirstRand’s First National Bank, South Africa’s third-largest
consumer bank, the Johannesburg-based lender said in an e-mailed
statement today. FirstRand also owns WesBank,  South Africa ’s
largest auto-loans provider, and Rand Merchant Bank, an
investment bank.  “Whilst the Group’s growth strategy is ultimately executed
on the ground by our operating franchises, FNB, RMB and WesBank,
it has become clear that successful implementation will require
a well coordinated approach across our entire group.” FirstRand
CEO Sizwe Nxasana said in the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
