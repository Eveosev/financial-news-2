Chilean authorities awarded a unit
of Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones SA concessions to
operate new frequencies in regions from Arica to Magallanes,

Entel to expand fixed telephone and internet networks in urban
areas, the Santiago-based financial  newspaper  reported, citing
decrees issued by the Transport and Telecommunications Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
