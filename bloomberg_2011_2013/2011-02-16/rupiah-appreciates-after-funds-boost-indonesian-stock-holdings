  Indonesia ’s rupiah advanced to a
three-month high after overseas investors boosted holdings of
the nation’s assets to benefit from growth in  Southeast Asia ’s
biggest economy. Bonds rose for a second consecutive day.  The currency has gained 1.9 percent this month as official
data showed gross domestic product rose 6.9 percent in the
fourth quarter, the most since 2004, and Bank Indonesia raised
borrowing costs for the first time in more than two years on
Feb. 4. Exchange data show global funds bought $231.7 million
more local shares than they sold this month, and the government
said today foreign holdings of the nation’s debt rose 1.8
percent from the end of January to 198.5 trillion rupiah ($22.4
billion).  “Foreign funds are coming in, they are expecting at least
one or two more interest-rate hikes by Bank Indonesia in the
first half of this year,” said Mika Martumpal, a senior market
analyst at PT Bank Commonwealth in Jakarta. “The earlier
increase showed that  Bank Indonesia  is more focused on fighting
inflation.”  The rupiah gained 0.3 percent from Feb. 14 to 8,888 per
dollar as of 4:38 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It rose to as high as 8,887, the strongest level
since Nov. 11. Indonesia’s financial markets were closed for a
public holiday yesterday.  Yields Drop  Bank Indonesia raised its  reference rate  to 6.75 percent
this month from a record-low 6.50 percent, citing price
pressures. Inflation accelerated to 7.02 percent in January from
6.96 percent in December, according to official data. The
central bank meets next on March 4 to review its policy rate.  Standard Chartered Plc raised the rupiah’s weighting to
“overweight” from “neutral,” citing Indonesia’s economic
growth and prospects policy makers will allow currency
appreciation to curb inflation. “Market fears that Bank
Indonesia is behind the curve have eased substantially,”  Standard Chartered  wrote in a report today.  The yield on the 8.25 percent note due July 2021 declined
12 basis points from Feb. 14 to 8.90 percent, according to
closing prices from the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
