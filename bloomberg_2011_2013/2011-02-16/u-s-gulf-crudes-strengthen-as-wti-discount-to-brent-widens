U.S. Gulf crude premiums
strengthened as West  Texas  Intermediate’s discount to the
European benchmark widened.  The spread between April-delivery WTI futures and Brent,
the basis for European and West African crudes, widened $2.14 to
$16.21 a barrel at 4:46 p.m. in  New York . When Brent is higher
than WTI, it strengthens the value of low-sulfur U.S. grades
that compete with West African oils priced against Brent.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium strengthened 95 cents to a
record $20.75 a barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened 90 cents to
$20.60 a barrel.  Among Gulf Coast sour, or high-sulfur, grades, Mars Blend’s
premium to WTI strengthened $1 to $14.60 a barrel, while
Poseidon increased 50 cents to $14.50 over the benchmark.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium widened 75 cents to $13.35.
Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI strengthened 85 cents to $20.
West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 60 cents to $6.15. WTS is
delivered in Midland, Texas, so its price is less influenced by
imports.  Syncrude’s premium widened 50 cents to $8.50 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands  in Alberta.  The discount for Western Canada Select was unchanged at
$19.75 a barrel.  No Seaway Reversal    ConocoPhillips  isn’t interested in reversing the Seaway
pipeline that brings crude from the U.S. Gulf Coast to the fuel
hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, Chief Executive Officer Jim Mulva said
yesterday. Cushing inventories reached a record high last month.  A reversal would relieve the glut at Cushing by sending as
much as 350,000 barrels a day of crude to Houston, according to
JBC Energy GmbH, a Vienna-based researcher.  Barclays Capital analysts said last week that the high
inventories at Cushing and new deliveries from  TransCanada
Corp .’s Keystone pipeline have combined to separate WTI, the
U.S. benchmark, from Brent crude oil traded in  London . Brent’s
premium to WTI, which averaged 63 cents in 2010, surged to
$15.85 on Feb. 11.  The 530-mile (853-kilometer) Seaway pipeline, operated by  Enterprise Products Partners LP , carries crude northbound from
Freeport, Texas, to Cushing. It also supplies refineries in the
Houston area and has a usable storage capacity of 3.4 million
barrels, according to the company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
