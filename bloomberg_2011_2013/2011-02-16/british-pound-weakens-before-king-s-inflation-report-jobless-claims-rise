The pound erased its gains versus
the dollar and extended its decline versus the euro before the
Bank of England’s inflation report.  Sterling was little changed at $1.6132 at 10:06 a.m. in  London  after climbing as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The pound
was down 0.4 percent to 83.97 pence per euro.  Governor Mervyn King presents the central bank’s inflation
outlook at 10:30 a.m. local time. Data earlier today showed
British unemployment claims unexpectedly rose in January.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
