  Argentina ’s soybean crop, the
world’s third largest, may exceed 50 million tons if rains this
week boost yields, Agricultural Undersecretary Oscar Solis said.  “The drought and heat in December obviously affected
yields,” Solis said today in a telephone interview from  Buenos
Aires . “If it rains as forecast later this week, soybeans may
even give a surprise of more than 50 million tons,” he said.  The Buenos Aires Cereals Exchange and the Rosario Cereals
Exchange both forecast this month that the crop would be between
47 million tons and 48 million tons as drought induced by La
Nina, a weather pattern that forms in the Pacific Ocean, pared
output. Last year farmers had record output of 55 million tons.  Argentine farmers completed sowing of the crop earlier this
month. Harvesting starts next month and runs until June.  The U.S is the biggest producer of soybeans and  Brazil  is
the second largest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
