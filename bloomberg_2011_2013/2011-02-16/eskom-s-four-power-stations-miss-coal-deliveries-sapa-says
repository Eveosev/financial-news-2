Four of Eskom Holdings Ltd.’s power
stations did not receive deliveries of coal by road yesterday
because of a strike by truck drivers, the South African Press
Association said, citing Hilary Joffe, the company spokeswoman.  The state-owned power utility has 40 days of coal
stockpiles, which cushions it from supply disruptions, she told
the Johannesburg-based news service.  About 65,000 workers went on strike demanding higher wages
on Feb. 14, the news agency said. Four labor unions representing
the workers are demanding a 20 percent pay increase allocated
over a two-year period, Sapa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
