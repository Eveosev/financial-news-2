  Portugal ’s unemployment rate rose in
the fourth quarter to the highest since at least 1998 amid the
deepest government spending cuts in more than three decades.  The jobless rate climbed to 11.1 percent from 10.9 percent
in the third quarter, the National Statistics Institute said
today in an e-mailed statement. It rose from 10.1 percent a year
earlier.  Portugal’s economy shrank 0.3 percent in the final three
months of 2010, the first quarterly contraction in a year, as
the government cut spending and raised taxes to narrow its  budget deficit . The Bank of Portugal predicts the economy will
contract 1.3 percent in 2011. Prime Minister  Jose Socrates ’
government forecasts economic growth of 0.2 percent this year.  The government is trimming the wage bill by 5 percent for
public-sector workers earning more than 1,500 euros ($2,030) a
month, freezing hiring and raising value-added  sales tax  by 2
percentage points to 23 percent to convince investors it can
avoid a bailout and further narrow the euro region’s fourth-
biggest budget gap after Greece’s debt crisis led to a surge in
borrowing costs last year.  The opposition Left Bloc last week said it will present a
no-confidence motion against the government in parliament on
March 10 to “fight policies that promote unemployment and
precariousness.” The  People’s Party  and the Social Democrats
this week said they will block the motion by abstaining.  Trade unions representing workers at CP-Comboios de
Portugal EPE, the state-owned operator of Portugal’s rail
service, called strikes for yesterday and today. Workers at
Lisbon’s subway and bus services also staged strikes last week.  Socrates became prime minister in 2005 and his Socialist
Party won re-election in 2009 without a majority in parliament.
The  Social Democrats , the biggest opposition party, agreed in
October to let the government’s 2011 budget proposal pass in
parliament by abstaining.  To contact the reporter on this story:
