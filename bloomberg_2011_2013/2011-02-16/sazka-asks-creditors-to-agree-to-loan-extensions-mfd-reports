Sazka AS, a Czech lottery operator,
asked creditors to agree to an extension of debt repayments,
Mlada Fronta Dnes  reported , citing a letter obtained by Czech
mining and finance company KKCG.  KKCG, owned by billionaire Karel Komarek, rejected the
request and took its 400 million-koruna ($22 million) claim,
which was due for repayment on Dec. 17, to a court, asking it to
install an administrator at Sazka, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
