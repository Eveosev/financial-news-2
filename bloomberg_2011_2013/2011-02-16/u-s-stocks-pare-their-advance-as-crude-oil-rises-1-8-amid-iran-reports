U.S. stocks pared gains, with the
Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index near a 32-month high, as oil
extended its rise after the Al Arabiya network reported that two
Iranian warships are moving toward the Suez Canal.  The  S&P 500  advanced 0.2 percent to 1,330.53 at 12:13 p.m.
in New York. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  increased 23.46
points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,250.10.  The S&P 500 gained 5.6 percent this year through yesterday
amid government stimulus measures and higher-than-estimated
corporate profits. Earnings-per-share have topped estimates at
about 73 percent of the 371 companies in the S&P 500 that
reported results since Jan. 10, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Crude oil for March delivery rose $1.51, or 1.8 percent, to
$85.83 a barrel at 11:59 a.m. on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract increased as much as $1.57 to $85.89. Al
Arabiya reported that two Iranian warships are moving toward the  Suez Canal  and then on to Syria, bolstering concern petroleum
shipments from the Middle East will be disrupted, citing Israeli
sources it did not identify.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
