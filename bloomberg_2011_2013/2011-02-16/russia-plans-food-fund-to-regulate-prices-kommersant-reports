Russia may create a fund to buy and
sell food to help regulate prices as inflation accelerates,
Kommersant reported, citing government documents.  First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov ordered the
Agriculture, Finance and Economy ministries to formulate
mechanisms to regulate food prices, the Moscow-based newspaper
reported today. The government may start with buying and selling
potatoes, which have jumped 25 percent in price since the start
of the year, Kommersant reported.   The government may fund the program from money received
from selling stockpiled grain, the newspaper said.   Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
