Nigeria’s  biggest opposition party
started its campaign for the presidential election today,
promising to tackle corruption and to boost economic growth if
elected in April’s poll.  “We need a leadership that can work to create a united,
secure and just society that will meet the demands of the 21st
century,” Nuhu Ribadu, the candidate for the  Action Congress of
Nigeria , said in a speech today in Abuja, the capital.  Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, is set to hold
presidential elections on April 9. Ribadu, a Muslim from the
northeastern Adamawa state, will compete against incumbent
President  Goodluck Jonathan  of the ruling People’s  Democratic
Party , or PDP, and former military ruler General Muhammadu Buhari of the Congress for Progressive Change.  As the first head of the anti-graft agency, the Economic
and Financial Crimes Commission, Ribadu brought corruption
charges against politicians in the PDP and government officials,
including serving governors and ministers. He promised “not to
allow the corrupt to fight corruption” if elected.  The ruling  People’s Democratic Party , or PDP, has governed  Nigeria , the continent’s top oil producer, since the West
African nation returned to civilian rule in 1999.  Parliamentary and state governorship polls are scheduled
for April 2 and 16 respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
