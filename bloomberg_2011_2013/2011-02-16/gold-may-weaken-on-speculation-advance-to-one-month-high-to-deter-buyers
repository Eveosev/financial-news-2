Gold fluctuated in  New York  after
reaching a four-week high as investors weighed concerns that
China will move to cool its economy as global inflation
accelerates.  China’s consumer prices increased to 4.9 percent in
January, exceeding the government’s target for a fourth month,
while U.K. inflation accelerated to the fastest pace in more
than two years, data showed yesterday. China’s interest-rate
swaps rose for a second day on speculation the central bank will
tighten monetary policy further. Protests in Yemen continued and
there were reports that unrest spread to Libya.  “Support will continue to come from increases in
inflation, growing investment,” Tom Pawlicki, an analyst at MF
Global in  Chicago , said today in a report. “Opposing pressure
will be offered by potential tightening in  China .”  Gold futures for April delivery added as much as $4.40, or
0.3 percent, to $1,378.50 an ounce, the highest price since
Jan. 19, and were at $1,375 at 7:58 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Prices gained and lost as much as 0.3 percent. The metal
for immediate delivery in  London  was 0.1 percent higher at
$1,374.59.  Bullion rose to $1,374.50 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,372.75 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing.  Concern about rising inflation and currency debasement
drove prices up 30 percent last year, setting a record $1,432.50
in December. China last week joined  India , Indonesia, Thailand
and South Korea in boosting  interest rates  as policy makers
sought to cool the economies leading a global rebound.  Mass Demonstration  India’s benchmark wholesale-price index rose 8.23 percent
in January, Indonesia’s inflation is 7 percent and South Korea’s
is 4.1 percent, the latest government data show. The  Bank of
England  today forecast inflation will accelerate further from a
two-year high and peak at about 4.4 percent before easing to its
2 percent target by the middle of 2012.  “Tensions in the Middle East will continue to be an
issue,” MF Global’s Pawlicki said. Gold gained the previous two
weeks as mass demonstrations in  Egypt  forced President Hosni Mubarak to cede power to the army.  Yemen Protests  In Yemen, hundreds of protesters took to the streets for a
sixth day, marching to demand the immediate resignation of the
president of 32 years, Ali Abdullah Saleh. Hundreds of
protesters in  Libya , where Muammar Qaddafi has held power since
leading a military coup in 1969, gathered in the port city of
Benghazi demanding the overthrow of the government, the
Associated Press reported.  Gold held in exchange-traded products fell 3.21 metric tons
to 2,016.98 tons yesterday, the lowest level since June 7, data
compiled by Bloomberg from 10 providers show. Holdings reached a
record 2,114.6 tons in December.  Silver for March delivery in New York added 0.3 percent to
$30.775 an ounce. Palladium for March delivery was little
changed at $839.35 an ounce, after yesterday reaching $848.50,
the highest level since March 2001. Platinum for April delivery
was 0.1 percent higher at $1,834 an ounce.  “We are seeing continued reshuffling within the sector to
more cyclically sensitive precious metals,”  Carsten Fritsch , a
Frankfurt-based analyst at  Commerzbank AG , said today in a
report. “Rising commodity prices alongside a reviving economy
and ample liquidity suggest higher inflation risks in the long
term, from which precious metals should benefit.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
