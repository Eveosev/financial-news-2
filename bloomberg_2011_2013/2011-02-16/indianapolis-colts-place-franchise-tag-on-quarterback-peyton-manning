Indianapolis Colts quarterback  Peyton Manning  was given the franchise tag to ensure he remains
with the National Football League team, owner Jim Irsay said.  “We have placed the franchise tag on Peyton while we
continue to negotiate a long-term deal,” Irsay wrote last night
on Twitter.  The decision could cost the Colts $23 million next season
to keep Manning, who signed a $98 million, seven-year deal in
2004, the Associated Press said. Forbes magazine said Manning is
the seventh-highest-paid player in the NFL. The franchise tag
prevents any other team from negotiating with a player.  During his 13 seasons with the Colts, the 34-year-old
Manning has taken the team to the playoffs 11 times, won seven
American Football Conference South titles, two AFC championships
and one  Super Bowl .  To contact the reporter on this story:
