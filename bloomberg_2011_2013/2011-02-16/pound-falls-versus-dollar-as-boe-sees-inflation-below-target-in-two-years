The pound weakened against the
dollar and extended a drop versus the euro after the  Bank of
England  said the consumer price index of inflation is likely to
fall below its target in two years.  The British currency slid 0.3 percent to $1.6077 as of
10:36 a.m. in  London  and was 0.7 percent weaker at 84.18 pence
per euro.  The bankâ€™s central forecast is for inflation to peak at
about 4.4 percent this year before easing to the 2 percent goal
by the middle of 2012, and undershooting the target by the end
of the forecast period, it said in its quarterly inflation
report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
