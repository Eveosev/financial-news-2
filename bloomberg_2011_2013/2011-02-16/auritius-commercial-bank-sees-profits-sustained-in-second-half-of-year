  Mauritius Commercial Bank  Ltd., the
country’s biggest company by market value, will probably
maintain its current level of profitability in the second half
of the financial year, Chief Executive Officer Pierre-Guy Noel
said.  “The strong capital and liquidity bases of the MCB group,
together with its diversified products and markets, should
ensure that the current level of profitability is maintained,”
Noel said in an e-mailed statement today.  The Port Louis-based lender on Feb. 11 reported a 12
percent increase in profit to 1.05 billion rupees ($35.5
million) for the second quarter through December and 2 billion-
rupee net income for the first six months. Mauritius Commercial
Bank makes up 24 percent of the  Mauritius stock exchange ’s
Semdex Index.  Lower private investment may put pressure on profit margins
over the longer term, Noel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
