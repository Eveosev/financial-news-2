  Komercni Banka AS , the Czech unit of
Societe Generale SA, dropped the most in almost six months after
saying costs would grow faster than revenue, outweighing higher
profit and a pledge for a record-high dividend.  The stock tumbled 3.2 percent to 4,229 koruna at its 4:24
p.m. close in  Prague , its biggest daily decline since Aug. 24,
valuing the company at 160.7 billion koruna ($8.9 billion).
Almost 200,000 shares changed hands today, or more than double
the daily average in the past three months.  Cost growth is likely to outstrip revenue expansion this
year, Chief Financial Officer Pavel Cejka said today after the
Prague-based lender reported fourth-quarter net income rose an
annual 31 percent and that the board will propose a dividend of
270 koruna per share.  While the earnings are “slightly better than expected,”
the cost-growth outlook may have caused the stock drop, analyst
Marek Hatlapatka at Cyrrus brokerage in Brno,  Czech Republic ,
wrote in a report to clients today. “What is definitely
positive is the size of the proposed dividend.”  Net income jumped to 3.37 billion koruna ($188 million) in
the last three months of 2010 from 2.57 billion koruna a year
earlier, the country’s third-largest bank said today on its
website. That beat the 3.13 billion-koruna average estimate by
nine analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
