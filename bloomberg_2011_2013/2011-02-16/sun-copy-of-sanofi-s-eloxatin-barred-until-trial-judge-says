  Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd .
must refrain from selling a generic version of  Sanofi-Aventis
SA ’s Eloxatin cancer drug until a court can rule on a contract
dispute between the companies, a federal judge said.  Sanofi’s request to prevent sales is granted “until this
court resolves all issues pertaining to the interpretation” of
a settlement agreement, U.S. District Judge Joel Pisano in
Trenton,  New Jersey , said today.  Sun began selling its copy last year after settling a
patent-infringement lawsuit brought by Sanofi. Paris-based
Sanofi later claimed Sun misinterpreted the agreement and sued
as the generics prompted an 81 percent plunge in U.S. sales of
the branded drug in the fourth quarter of 2009 to 7 million
euros ($9.5 million).  Sanofi contends that Sun should have stopped selling the
copy once agreements were signed with other generic-drug makers,
including  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd . and  Novartis AG ’s
Sandoz. Those companies agreed not to sell generic Eloxatin
until August 2012.  Sun, based in Mumbai, argued that a portion of the
agreement was triggered only if a court ruled in Sanofi’s favor,
not when there was an agreement reached with the other
companies. A U.S. appeals court in December  said  Pisano erred in
halting Sun sales without first ruling on the interpretation of
the settlement.  The case is Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC v. Sandoz Inc.,
07cv2762, U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey
(Trenton).  To contact the reporter on this story:
