Japan Atomic Power Co. signed a
preliminary agreement with Vietnam Electricity Holding Co. to
carry out a feasibility study for  Vietnam ’s second nuclear
plant.  Japan Atomic and the Vietnamese company plan to sign a
final agreement by the end of March to conduct the study after
Vietnam Electricity provides more information, Japan Atomic
spokesman Mitsuru Marutani said today.  The study, which may take between 12 and 18 months, will
assess the suitability of the planned location of the station
and the type of reactor to be used, Marutani said.  Vietnam agreed to make Japan a partner in building the
nuclear plant in Ninh Thuan province in southern Vietnam in
October. Japan Atomic Power Co. is owned by utilities including
Tokyo Electric Power Co.,  Asia ’s biggest electricity company.  To contact the reporters on this story:
