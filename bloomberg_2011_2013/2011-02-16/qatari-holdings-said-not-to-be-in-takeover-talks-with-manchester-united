Qatari Holding LLC isn’t in talks to
buy Premier League soccer club Manchester United, according to a
person with knowledge of the investment group’s plans.  The  Daily Mail  reported last week that the holding company,
the foreign investment arm of the Qatar Investment Authority,
was interested in buying the 18-time English champion. The
newspaper said the Qataris weren’t willing to meet the 1.8
billion pound ($2.9 billion) price set by the Glazer family,
which owns United.  The Qataris aren’t in talks nor have had discussions to buy
United, said the person, who declined to be identified. Ahmad Al-Sayed, CEO of Qatar Holding, wasn’t available for comment.  United’s bonds rose to a record yesterday amid speculation
about a sale. Philip Townsend, a spokesman for Manchester United
and its owners, said no approach has been made to buy the club,
and the team isn’t for sale.    Manchester United ’s 250 million pounds ($400 million) of
8.75 percent notes due 2017 rose to 111.44 pence in the pound
yesterday, taking their gain since Feb. 8 to 5.28 percent.
Today, they fell 0.25 pence to 109.5 pence in the pound,
according to pricing data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
