U.S. stock-index futures gained,
signaling the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may return to a 32-
month high, after Dell Inc.’s earnings topped estimates and
housing starts increased more than economists forecast.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
March climbed 0.3 percent to 1,330.8 at 8:36 a.m. in  New York .

12,238.  Housing starts climbed 15 percent to a 596,000 annual
rate, the most this year, Commerce Department figures showed.
The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey called
for a 539,000 rate. Work started on 78 percent more dwellings
with two or more units, overshadowing a drop in single-family
houses.  A separate report showed wholesale costs in the U.S.
increased for a seventh consecutive month in January, led by
higher prices for fuel. The  producer price index  rose 0.8
percent, Labor Department data showed, matching the median
economist estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  The S&P 500 has gained 96 percent from its 12-year low in
March 2009 through yesterday amid government stimulus measures
and higher-than-estimated corporate profits. The advance pushed
the  S&P 500  to 15.88 times the reported operating earnings of
its companies this week, the highest valuation since June.   Earnings Season  Some 73 percent of the 363 companies in the S&P 500 that
have reported results since Jan. 10 beat analysts’ estimates for
earnings-per-share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
index yesterday retreated from a 32-month high.         Dell Inc. jumped 6.5 percent to $14.81 in pre-market 
trading after the company posted profit, excluding some costs, 
of 53 cents a share in the quarter that ended on Jan. 28. Analysts
in a Bloomberg survey had estimated 37 cents on average. The
company also forecast annual sales growth that exceeded
projections.  Deere & Co. rose 1.6 percent to $95.15. The world’s largest
farm-equipment maker posted fiscal first-quarter profit that
beat analysts’ estimates and raised its full-year profit
forecast as higher crop prices boosted North American sales of
its tractors and combines.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
