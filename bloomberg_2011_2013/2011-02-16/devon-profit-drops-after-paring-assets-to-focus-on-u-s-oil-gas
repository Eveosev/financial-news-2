  Devon Energy Corp ., the U.S.
independent oil and natural-gas producer that sold more than $10
billion in assets last year, said profit fell as the value of
contracts used to lock in commodity prices dropped.  Fourth-quarter net income decreased to $562 million, or
$1.29 a share, from $667 million, or $1.49, a year earlier,
Oklahoma City-based Devon said in a statement today. Per-share
profit, excluding losses related to commodity and interest-rate
derivatives contracts, was 19 cents more than the average of 24
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales fell 13 percent to $2.14 billion and expenses
declined 7.1 percent to $1.47 billion. The company last year
agreed to sell offshore and overseas assets and used the
proceeds to buy back stock, pay down debt and spend $1.2 billion
to add more than 600,000 acres of oil and gas fields in the U.S.
and  Canada .  “Their costs fell as a result of the transformation from
offshore and international,” said Biju Perincheril, a New York-
based analyst for Jefferies & Co. who rates the shares “buy”
and owns none. “It was a pretty good quarter.”  Devon fell 44 cents to $87.66 at 9:37 a.m. in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares, which have
21 buy and 10 hold recommendations from analysts, have risen 12
percent this year.  Production and Reserves  Average daily production in the fourth quarter from fields
Devon is keeping rose 1.5 percent from a year earlier to the
equivalent of 618,500 barrels of oil, the company said. Weather
delayed some drilling and service interruptions reduced capacity
on Enbridge Inc.’s pipeline from Canada to U.S. markets, the
company said.  Devon’s proved reserves from U.S. and Canadian onshore
fields rose 36 percent at the end of last year to the equivalent
of 2.87 billion barrels of oil, from 2.11 billion barrels in
2009, the company said.  The company’s drilling plans for 2011 won’t change because
its $3.2 billion sale of Brazilian offshore leases to BP Plc
failed to close as expected last year, Chief Executive Officer
John Richels said in an interview today.  Brazil ’s regulatory
authority has yet to approve the deal.  Devon sold oil for an average of $68.35 a barrel during the
quarter, 7.1 percent more than a year ago. The average futures
price on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  was $85.24 a barrel,
according to Bloomberg data. Devon sold natural gas for $4.64 a
thousand cubic feet during the quarter, 4.3 percent more than a
year earlier. The Nymex average gas price was $3.98.  Apache is the largest U.S. independent oil and natural-gas
producer by market capitalization, followed by  Anadarko
Petroleum Corp . Independent producers are those without refining
and retail businesses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
