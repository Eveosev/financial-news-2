  Devon Energy Corp ., the third
largest U.S. independent oil and gas producer, said production
growth of oil and petroleum liquids this year may be less than
the company forecast because some wells are producing more
natural gas than expected.  The percentage increase in output of oil and petroleum
liquids will be in the “high teens,” below a November forecast
for 2011 of 20 percent, Chief Executive Officer John Richels
said in a conference call today.  Devon last year agreed to sell offshore and overseas assets
and used the proceeds to buy back stock and pay down debt. The
production forecast includes first oil late this year from
Jackfish 2, an oil-sands project in  Alberta .  The company today reported net income fell to $562 million,
or $1.29 a share, from $667 million, or $1.49, a year earlier,
Oklahoma City-based Devon said in a statement today. Per-share
profit, excluding losses related to commodity and interest-rate
derivatives contracts, was 19 cents more than the average of 24
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “Their costs fell as a result of the transformation from
offshore and international,” said Biju Perincheril, a New York-
based analyst for Jefferies & Co. who rates the shares “buy”
and owns none. “It was a pretty good quarter.”  Devon fell $1.88, or 2.1 percent, to $86.22 at 4:01 p.m. in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Before today,
the shares, which have 21 buy and 10 hold recommendations from
analysts, had risen 12 percent this year.  Production and Reserves  Average daily production in the fourth quarter from fields
Devon is keeping rose 1.5 percent from a year earlier to the
equivalent of 618,500 barrels of oil, the company said. Weather
delayed some drilling and service interruptions reduced capacity
on Enbridge Inc.’s pipeline from  Canada  to U.S. markets, the
company said.  Production this quarter will miss an earlier forecast
because of frozen wells and power failures in  Texas  this month,
Chief Financial Officer Jeff Agosta said on today’s call. Output
will be in a range from 615,000 barrel-equivalents per day to
625,000, below the previous 630,000-barrel forecast, he said.  Initial wells in the Avalon Shale, a deposit in the oil-
and-gas bearing Permian Basin that spreads across West Texas and
eastern  New Mexico , yielded a higher percentage of gas than
expected, resulting in the lower liquids forecast, David Hager,
vice president for production, said on the call. The company
plans to spend $650 million to drill 300 wells in the basin this
year.  Permian Basin  Proved reserves in the Permian Basin, discovered in 1920,
rose by nearly 529 million barrels in 2009 as new drilling
techniques found petroleum overlooked since the first oil
discovery there in 1920, according to the  Energy Department  in  Washington .  Devon’s proved reserves from U.S. and Canadian onshore
fields rose 36 percent at the end of last year to the equivalent
of 2.87 billion barrels of oil, from 2.11 billion barrels in
2009, the company said.  The company’s drilling plans for 2011 won’t change because
its $3.2 billion sale of Brazilian offshore leases to BP Plc
failed to close as expected last year, Richels said in an
interview today.  Brazil ’s regulatory authority has yet to
approve the deal.  Devon sold oil for an average of $68.35 a barrel during the
quarter, 7.1 percent more than a year ago. The average futures
price on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  was $85.24 a barrel,
according to Bloomberg data. Devon sold natural gas for $4.64 a
thousand cubic feet during the quarter, 4.3 percent more than a
year earlier. The Nymex average gas price was $3.98.  Apache is the largest U.S. independent oil and natural-gas
producer by market capitalization, followed by Anadarko
Petroleum Corp. Independent producers are those without refining
and retail businesses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
