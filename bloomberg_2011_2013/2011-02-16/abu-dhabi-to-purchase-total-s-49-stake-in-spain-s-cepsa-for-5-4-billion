  Abu Dhabi ’s International Petroleum
Investment Co. may sell bonds in euros and pounds following
investor meetings in cities including London, Amsterdam and
Paris starting Feb. 28, according to three people with knowledge
of the sale.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,  Banco Santander SA ,  BNP Paribas 
SA, Credit Agricole CIB, Deutsche Bank AG and UniCredit SpA are
arranging the meetings, the people said. IPIC is owned by the
Abu Dhabi government.  IPIC raised $2.5 billion in a debut offering of five- and
10-year dollar bonds in November. The $1 billion of five-year,
3.125 percent bonds were priced to yield 195 basis points above
similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries and the $1.5 billion of 10-
year, 5 percent-coupon notes were priced at a yield spread of
245 basis points over Treasuries, the company said Nov. 16. The
yield on the five-year notes fell 4 basis points to 4.009
percent at 1:36 p.m. in Abu Dhabi. They hit a record-high 4.045
percent yesterday, according to Bloomberg composite prices.  The company agreed Feb. 16 to pay  Total SA  3.97 billion
euros ($5.37 billion) for it 48.8 percent share of Cia. Espanola
de Petroleos SA, Spain’s second-largest oil company. IPIC
already owned 47 percent of Cepsa. The acquisition will give Abu
Dhabi processing capacity for the United Arab Emirates’ 2.4
million barrels a day of crude oil production.  Moody’s Investors Service has rated IPIC’s bonds Aa3, its
fourth-highest investment grade, one step lower than Abu Dhabi’s
level. The discrepancy was meant to reflect the “the absence of
an explicit formal agreement obligating the government to
support under all circumstances,” Moody’s said when assigning
the  credit rating  in Novemeber.  IPIC, set up by the Abu Dhabi government in 1984 to invest
in oil and gas business around the world, has $14 billion of
investments which include stakes in 14 separate companies,
according to the company’s  website .  To contact the reporters on this story:
