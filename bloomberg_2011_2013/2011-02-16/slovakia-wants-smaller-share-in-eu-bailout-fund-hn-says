Slovakia will seek to cut its share
in the European Stabilization Mechanism,  Hospodarske Noviny 
reported, citing Finance Minister Ivan Miklos.  The formula for calculating contributions of individual
countries to the new rescue facility shall be based solely on
the size of the economy, which will allow poorer countries such
as Slovakia to provide less, the newspaper said.  Slovakia also opposes giving direct loans to distressed
countries and its contribution should be limited to guarantees,
Hospodarske said citing Miklos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
