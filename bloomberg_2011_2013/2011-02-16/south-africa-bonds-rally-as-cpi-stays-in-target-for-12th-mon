  South Africa  bonds climbed after
inflation remained within the central bank’s target band for a
12th straight month, giving policy makers room to leave the
nation’s benchmark interest rate at a record low for longer.  The 13.5 percent security due September 2015 rallied 33
cents to 121.81 rand, pushing down the yield by 8 basis points
to 7.74 percent at 5:31 p.m. in Johannesburg. The rand advanced
0.9 percent to 7.2469 per dollar, from a London close of 7.3110
yesterday.  The consumer-price index of Africa’s biggest economy jumped
to 3.7 percent in January from 3.5 percent in December, the
Pretoria-based statistics office said on its  website  today. The
reading was the same as the median estimate of 20 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg and within the central bank’s target band
of 3 percent to 6 percent.  “Inflation is expected to average the year close to the
midpoint of the target,” Investec Ltd. economist Annabel Bishop
wrote today in a client note. “Interest rates should remain
unchanged for most of the year, with the possibility of a hike
in November 2011.”  South  Africa ’s central bank has reduced its main interest
rate nine times since December 2008 to a record low of 5.5
percent as a 42 percent surge in the rand versus the dollar in
2009 and 2010 helped reduce the cost of oil and other imports.
The rand has lost 9.2 percent against the dollar this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
