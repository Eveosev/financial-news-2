Italian banks including  UniCredit
SpA  and  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA  rose in Milan trading after the
Senate approved a budget amendment that may lead to higher  capital ratios  for lenders.  UniCredit,  Italy ’s biggest bank, gained 3.9 percent to 1.98
euros, its highest price since Sept. 15. That gives the company
a market value of 38.2 billion euros ($51.8 billion). Intesa,
the country’s No. 2 bank, rose 3.7 percent to 2.59 euros, its
highest level since Oct. 27.  Italian banks may count credit-loss deferred tax assets as
capital, according to the bill, which would align taxation on
the lenders to other European countries. Deferred tax assets are
used by banks to offset tax charges in future years.  “This measure would avoid a competitive disadvantage for
the country’s banks when new Basel III rules will be
effective,” said Emanuele Vizzini who manages 560 million euros
as chief investment officer of Investitori SGR in Milan. “It
would help banks to boost their capital and ratios.”  The budget legislation now will be reviewed by the Chamber
of Deputies and needs final approval by the end of February.  Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA and  Banco Popolare SC  would
benefit the most from the measure, according to a Mediobanca SpA
report published yesterday. “We estimate approximately 70 basis
points of additional capital for Monte Paschi and Banco
Popolare, and approximately 30-50 for Intesa and UniCredit,”
the bank said.  Monte Paschi rose 3.6 percent to 1.01 euros and Banco
Popolare gained 5.3 percent to 2.73 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
