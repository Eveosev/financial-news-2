Oil traded near the highest in more
than two years in  London  as civil unrest spread in the Middle
Eastern, renewing concern crude shipments will be disrupted.  Brent futures rose as much as 0.5 percent as pro-democracy
demonstrations stretched into a third day in Bahrain, while
protesters clashed with police in Yemen and Libya, the eighth-
biggest oil producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries. Prices were also supported by signs of economic
expansion in the U.S., the largest oil user.  “Places like Bahrain are next to  Saudi Arabia  and that is
the real problem if anything happens there,” said  Anthony Nunan , assistant general manager for risk management at
Mitsubishi Corp. in Tokyo. “The economic numbers are looking OK
in the U.S. That’s supportive for the oil market.”    Brent crude  for April settlement advanced as much as 52
cents to $104.30 a barrel and was at $103.89 a barrel at 8:44
a.m. on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London. The contract
rose yesterday by $2.14 to $103.78, the highest close since
Sept. 25, 2008.  Crude for March delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  was down 31 cents at $84.68 a barrel after gaining as
much as 31 cents to $85.30 a barrel. Prices rose 0.8 percent
yesterday to $84.99, the highest since Feb. 11. Oil in New York
is up 9.5 percent from a year ago.  The difference between the April contracts in London and
New York was at $16.20 a barrel, compared with $15.94 yesterday.
The March West Texas Intermediate contract in  New York  expires
on Feb. 22.  Middle East  Oil-market risk is “high and rising” amid unrest in the
Arab world, JPMorgan Chase & Co. said in a report. Crude gained
0.8 percent yesterday after Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said two Iranian gunboats are planning to move through
the Suez Canal.  Countries in the Middle East and North Africa were
responsible for 36 percent of global oil production and held 61
percent of proved reserves in 2009, according to BP Plc, which
publishes its BP Statistical Review of World Energy each June.  The  Associated Press  reported the first protests against
Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi, who has held power since leading
a military coup in 1969.  “Political tensions in the Middle East continued to
intensify, adding to crude supply disruption concerns,”  Mark Pervan , head of commodity research at Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. in Melbourne, said in a note today.    Libya  pumped 1.59 million barrels of crude a day in
January, making it the eighth-biggest oil producer among those
with quotas in OPEC, Bloomberg News estimates show.  Fed Outlook  U.S. Federal Reserve officials “continued to express
disappointment in both the pace and the unevenness of the
improvements in labor markets,” while also judging the recovery
to be on a “firmer footing,” the  Federal Open Market Committee 
said in minutes of its Jan. 25-26 meeting, released yesterday in  Washington . Policy makers raised projections for economic growth
this year and made little change to forecasts after 2011 or for
unemployment and inflation.  The jobless rate will average 8.8 percent to 9 percent in
the fourth quarter, Fed officials projected, down from November
forecasts of 8.9 percent to 9.1 percent.  U.S. crude stockpiles increased by 860,000 barrels to 345.9
million last week, an Energy Department report showed yesterday.
A 2 million-barrel gain was forecast, according to the median of
13 analyst responses in a Bloomberg News survey.  Gasoline supplies rose 205,000 barrels to 241.1 million,
the highest level since March 1990. Analysts projected a 1.85
million-barrel increase.  To contact the reporters on this story:
