Russian billionaire  Roman Abramovich , who fell two places to No. 5 on Finans magazine’s
annual rich list, owns seven homes in the U.K., three in France
and two in the U.S., he has disclosed.  The Chelsea Football Club owner has 16 houses and
apartments in all, as well as seven cars and shares in seven
companies, according to the billionaire’s income declaration for
regional elections in the Chukotka region across the Bering
Strait from  Alaska .  Abramovich’s fortune was little changed last year at about
$17.1 billion, Finans reported this week.  Abramovich, 44, owns six apartments in the U.K. ranging in
size from 35 square meters (377 square feet) to 481 square
meters as well as a 200-square-meter house. In  France , his three
