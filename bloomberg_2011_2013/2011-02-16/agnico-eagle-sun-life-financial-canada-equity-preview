(Corrects fourth paragraph to say jobless claims rose.)  Canadian stocks rose a fourth day as
energy and gold companies advanced amid renewed concerns about
stability in the Middle East and higher-than-forecast inflation
in the U.S.    Suncor Energy Inc ., the country’s biggest oil and gas
producer, gained 2.4 percent and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd.
increased 1.5 percent as crude rose.  Barrick Gold Corp . added
1.9 percent as gold advanced for a fourth day.  Agnico-Eagle
Mines Ltd . and  Sun Life Financial Inc . fell at least 2.6 percent
after reporting earnings that trailed analysts’ estimates.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index gained 76.97
points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 14,136.15 in Toronto,
heading for a weekly gain. That’s the highest level for the
gauge since July 2008.  “The manufacturing data that came out of the U.S. was very
strong,” said Youssef Zohny, who helps oversee C$50 million
($49.8 million) as a portfolio manager at Van Arbor Asset
Management Ltd. in  Vancouver . “But you kind of have a mixed
picture,” with jobless claims and inflation rising.  The S&P/TSX has risen 5.2 percent this year as economic
data and corporate earnings signaled that the global economic
recovery is becoming more entrenched. Of the 75 companies in the
gauge that have reported earnings since Jan. 10, 38 have
exceeded analysts’ earnings-per-share estimates.  Crude oil in New York added $1.37 to settle at $86.36 after
protesters clashed with police in Bahrain, Yemen and  Libya , and
Iranian state-run television said the country was sending two
warships to the  Suez Canal .  Energy Companies  A subgroup of energy companies in the Canadian benchmark
equity index increased 1.1 percent. Suncor Energy gained 2.4
percent to C$44.48. Canadian Natural Resources rose 1.5 percent
to C$47.23. Talisman Energy Inc. climbed 2 percent to C$23.61,
the highest price since June 2008.  Manufacturing in the Philadelphia region expanded in
February at the fastest pace in seven years, underscoring
factories’ contribution to the U.S. economic expansion. The
Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic index
rose to 35.9, the highest since January 2004, exceeding the
median forecast of 21 in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  Consumer prices in the U.S. climbed 0.4 percent in January,
the Labor Department said, exceeding the 0.3 percent median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Applications for
jobless benefits increased to 410,000 last week, above
economists’ forecast of 400,000.  Gold Producers  Gold producers gained for a fourth day as rising consumer
prices boosted investor demand for the metal as an inflation
hedge. Gold futures for April delivery climbed 0.7 percent to
$1,375.10 an ounce in New York. Barrick Gold advanced 1.9
percent to C$49.91.  Goldcorp Inc . added 1.1 percent to $44.10.  Teck Resources declined 2.9 percent to C$55.87, the lowest
price since December 9. First Quantum Minerals Ltd., the
country’s second-largest publicly traded copper producer,
declined 0.7 percent to C$130.66.  Agnico-Eagle Mines fell 4.8 percent to C$71.75. The gold
producer reported fourth quarter earnings excluding certain
items that missed the average analyst estimate by 25 percent,
Bloomberg data showed.  Sun Life Financial Inc. retreated 2.6 percent to C$33.02.  Canada ’s third-biggest insurer reported fourth-quarter net
income of 88 cents a share, missing the average analyst estimate
by 3 percent. The company’s shares were downgraded to “hold”
from “buy” at Canaccord Genuity Ltd.  To contact the reporters on this story:
