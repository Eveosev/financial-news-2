Angola plans to reduce daily crude
oil exports by 13 percent in April from a month earlier, a
preliminary loading program obtained by Bloomberg News shows.  Africaâ€™s second-largest oil producer plans to ship 45.1
million barrels, or 1.50 million a day, down from 53.7 million,
or 1.73 million a day, according to the program.  The April shipments comprise 47 crude cargoes versus a
revised 56 for March. There will be eight Cabinda, four Dalia,
seven Girassol, five Hungo, four Kissanje, three Kuito, two
Mondo, seven Nemba, one Palanca, four Plutonio, and two Saxi
shipments, the program shows.  Each Girassol and Plutonio cargo is 1 million barrels,
Kuito 920,000 barrels and Palanca 985,000 barrles. The remaining
cargoes are 950,000 barrels each.  The final program for April will be released later this
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
