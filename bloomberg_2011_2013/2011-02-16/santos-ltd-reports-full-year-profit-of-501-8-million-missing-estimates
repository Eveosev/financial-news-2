  Santos Ltd ., Australia’s third-
largest oil and gas producer, said 2010 profit rose 15 percent
on higher prices for the commodities.  Net income increased to A$500 million from A$434 million in
the prior year, the Adelaide-based company said in a statement
today. Analysts expected profit of A$535 million, according to a
median of eight estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales gained 2 percent to A$2.2 billion, while production
declined 8 percent to 49.9 million barrels of oil equivalent.
Santos said it expects 2011 production of between 48 million and
52 million barrels as wet weather continues to affect operations
in the Cooper Basin in central Australia.  Santos and its partners  Total SA , Petroliam Nasional Bhd.
and  Korea Gas Corp . are developing a $16 billion liquefied
natural gas project at Gladstone. The venture is one of four on
the Queensland coast planning to liquefy gas extracted from coal
deposits for export to Asian customers.  The Spar and Reindeer ventures in Western Australia, the
Chim Sao oilfield in Vietnam and the Wortel gasfield in
Indonesia are due to start production this year.  “Santos is on track to deliver incremental production from
four new projects in 2011,” Chief Executive Officer David Knox
said in the statement.  Spending on LNG  Capital expenditure this year is expected to rise 58
percent to A$3 billion, with two-thirds of that allocated to LNG
projects, Santos said. Production costs are forecast to rise to
between A$550 million and A$590 million from A$537 million last
year.  Underlying profit, after stripping out certain items,
climbed 46 percent to A$376 million, beating the A$359 million
median in the Bloomberg analyst survey. The average price Santos
received for its oil rose 11 percent to A$87.35 a barrel, while
the average gas price climbed 5 percent to A$4.31 a gigajoule.  The oil and gas producer declared a final dividend of 15
Australian cents, compared with 20 cents a year earlier. Santos
said in December that it will reduce dividend payments to help
fund its “transformational” portfolio of projects, including
Gladstone and the  Exxon Mobil Corp .-led LNG venture in  Papua New
Guinea , where it is a partner.  Santos ranks behind  BHP Billiton Ltd . and  Woodside
Petroleum Ltd . among Australian oil and gas producers.  To contact the reporter on this story:  James Paton  in Sydney   jpaton4@bloomberg.net .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
