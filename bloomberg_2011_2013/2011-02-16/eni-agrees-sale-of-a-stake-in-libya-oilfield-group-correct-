(Corrects size of stake sale in first paragraph.)    Eni SpA  and OAO Gazprom signed an
agreement which paves the way for a future “handover” to
Gazprom of half of its 33.3 percent stake in a group developing
the Elephant oilfield in  Libya , Eni said in a statement today.
The stake is valued at around $170 million. The two companies
also signed an agreement which binds both parties to sign by
Feb. 28 a gas sale agreement for gas which will be produced in
the Siberian fields of Severenergija, Eni said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
