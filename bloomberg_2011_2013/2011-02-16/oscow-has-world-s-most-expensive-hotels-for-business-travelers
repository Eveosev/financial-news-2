Moscow hotels remained the world’s
most expensive for business customers for a sixth straight year,
ahead of  New York , Geneva, Paris and Zurich in a survey of 2010
rates by  Hogg Robinson Group Plc , a U.K. business travel agency.  The average Moscow room rate paid by a Hogg Robinson client
last year actually slipped 3 percent to 258.67 pounds ($415),
the Basingstoke, England-based company said in an e-mailed
 report . Doha was the only other city in the top 10 which saw a
drop, while Zurich,  Hong Kong  and Stockholm rates surged more
than 10 percent.  “More than half of the 75 cities we surveyed recorded room
rate increases, reflecting the improving, albeit tentative,
levels of business confidence,” Margaret Bowler, director of
global hotel relations, said in the report, which was published
yesterday. “Particular countries and regions are emerging
quicker than others from recession, but there are definite signs
of increasing room rates, which go hand in hand with increasing
business travel.”  Business travel can act as an early barometer of economic
growth or a slowdown in activity, Chief Financial Officer Julian Steadman said in an interview yesterday. The world economy
rebounded in 2010 from the global financial crisis, led by
emerging market economies such as China, India and  Argentina .  In local currency terms, the average Moscow rate fell 12
percent to 13,250 rubles ($452), Hogg Robinson, which was
founded by a wine merchant in 1845, said.  New York hotel room rates rose 3 percent to 211.92 pounds
in 2010 from a year earlier. Zurich rates gained 13 percent to
198.58 pounds and Geneva 9 percent to 203.42 pounds. Paris was
unchanged at almost 201 pounds, representing a 5 percent decline
in local currency terms to 234.3 euros ($316).  The biggest drop was in  Abu Dhabi  where the construction of
new hotels resulted in rates plunging 25 percent to 167.81
pounds. In  Australia , Brisbane rates climbed 32 percent and
Sydney hotel room prices surged 21 percent partly due to
fluctuating exchange rates.  London average rates rose 3 percent to 156.91 pounds,
ranking the U.K. capital 29th of the cities surveyed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
