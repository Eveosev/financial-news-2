Cotton futures climbed to a record
in New York on speculation that demand is increasing in  China ,
the world’s largest importer, and as flooding hurt crops in  Australia .  China’s textile mills increased yarn output by 14 percent
to 27 million metric tons last year, a government commission
said last month. Australia, the world’s fourth-largest exporter,
will harvest 6.2 percent less than a December estimate, a
government agency said yesterday. Cotton prices on ICE Futures
U.S. have more than doubled in the past year.  “Strong buying and limited supplies is a very good
combination to push prices higher,” said Gary Raines, an
economist at FCStone Fibers & Textiles in Nashville, Tennessee.  Cotton futures for May delivery rose the exchange-imposed
limit of 7 cents, or 3.7 percent, to settle at a record $1.9493
a pound at 2:40 p.m. on ICE in  New York . The price has climbed
16 percent this month.  China imported 2.84 million tons of the commodity last
year, the most since 2006, according to customs figures.  The fiber may more than double to $5 by the end of May,
WorldCrops.com, a website by VM Group in  London , said today.  In the year ending July 31, the U.S. is forecast to be the
leading exporter, followed by India and Uzbekistan, U.S.
