Dustin Byfuglien, who ranks fifth
among defensemen in scoring in the  National Hockey League  this
season, signed a contract extension with the  Atlanta Thrashers .  Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed yesterday by the team.
Byfuglien, selected as an All-Star this season, signed a five-
year extension worth $26 million, the  Associated Press  reported
without saying where it got the information.  Byfuglien, 25, acquired by Atlanta in a trade with the
Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks in the offseason, has 43
points and leads all league defensemen with 17 goals this
season.  “Dustin has emerged into an elite player this season and
been invaluable as a leader both on and off the ice,” Thrashers
General Manager Rick Dudley said in a statement on the team’s
website. “It was a priority to sign him and we’re looking
forward to witnessing his All-Star caliber play for many years
to come.”  Byfuglien was picked by the Blackhawks in the eighth round
of the 2003 NHL Entry Draft. He has played in 318 games and
totaled 152 points for Chicago and Atlanta. He also has tallied
25 points in 39 career playoff games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
