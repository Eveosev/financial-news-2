Former Federal Reserve Chairman  Alan Greenspan  said the political revolution in Egypt won’t have the
same impact on the global economy as the collapse of the Berlin
Wall two decades ago.  Greenspan, who now heads his own consulting firm, Greenspan
Associates, made the comments in a telephone interview from  Washington . Goldman Sachs Asset Management’s Jim O’Neill said on
Feb. 14 that the end of Hosni Mubarak’s 30-year rule in Egypt
resembles a “Berlin Wall moment” because it may open Middle
Eastern countries to world trade.  On Egypt:  “If Egypt adopts a more competitive, free-market system,
its rate of growth will certainly rise. While that will
doubtless enhance growth in the Middle East, it cannot match the
consequences the fall of the  Berlin Wall  initiated.  “The fall of the Berlin Wall was a seminal event that led
to the widespread adoption of competitive markets that, in turn,
created a dramatic rise in income in  China  and the rest of
emerging Asia.  “Since they didn’t have either a consumption culture or
financing capabilities to consume those large incomes, the
incomes were largely saved. That, in my judgment, is the major
reason why long-term interest rates came down worldwide and
global economic growth soared.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
