Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in  South Korea  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of 3 p.m. close.  The  Kospi index  fell 21.41, or 1.1 percent, to 1,989.11.  Builders:  GS Engineering & Construction Corp . (006360 KS)
retreated 4.4 percent to 107,500 won. Hyundai Engineering &
Construction Co. (000720 KS) dropped 4.1 percent to 77,900 won.
The builders declined amid speculation projects in the Middle
East will be disrupted because of mounting political turmoil in
the Middle East. Thousands gathered in Bahrain’s capital,
Manama, to demand democracy and an end to discrimination against
the Shiite Muslim majority as unrest inspired by popular revolts
in Tunisia and  Egypt  swept the Middle East.  Shipbuilders: Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. (009540 KS), the
world’s biggest shipbuilder, lost 3.1 percent to 440,000 won.
Samsung Heavy Industries Co. (010140 KS) declined 4.8 percent to
35,000 won. South Korea failed to recover its status as the
world’s leading shipbuilding nation in January, lagging behind  China , Yonhap News reported, citing data from London-based
market researcher Clarkson Research.    Korea Electric Power Corp . (015760 KS), supplier of almost
all of the country’s electricity, gained 1.9 percent to 29,050
won.  Sumitomo Corp . and Korea Electric Power signed a final
agreement for a $1.5 billion power project in the United Arab
Emirates, a Sumitomo official said. Korea Electric also
confirmed the deal in a statement.    Korea Line Corp . (005880 KS), which resumed trading today,
lost 15 percent, or the daily limit, to 21,450 won. The company
will enter court receivership upon a decision by the Seoul
Central District Court, according to a filing. Trading of the
South Korean bulk carrier was halted on Jan. 25.  Meritz Fire & Marine Insurance Co. (000060 KS), a South
Korean non-life insurer, lost 6.2 percent to 9,110 won, the most
since July 13, 2009. The company’s financial strength rating may
be downgraded by Moody’s Investors Service, which cited a plan
to transfer part of its assets to form a holding company.  Shinsegae Co. (004170 KS), a South Korean retailer, added
2.8 percent to 275,000 won. The company plans to spin off its
discount-store division on May 1, a regulatory filing today
showed. Shinsegae will keep its department-store business, the
company said.  Woongjin Chemical Co. (008000 KS), a South Korean synthetic
fibers maker, jumped 8.2 percent to 1,255 won, the most since
May 27, on speculation the company will post “strong” earnings
growth this year, said Cha Hong Sun, an analyst with Hanwha
Securities Co. Operating profit may rise 48 percent this year as
higher cotton prices boost demand for cheaper alternatives, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
