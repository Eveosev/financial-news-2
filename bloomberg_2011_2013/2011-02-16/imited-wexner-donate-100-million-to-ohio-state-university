Leslie Wexner, chairman and chief
executive officer of Limited Brands Inc.,  and his company’s
foundation will give $100 million to  Ohio State University , the
largest gift in the school’s history.  Wexner, the chairman of the university’s board, pledged $65
million, and the foundation will give $35 million, the
university in Columbus said today in a statement on its  website .
The majority of the donation will go to the academic medical
center, the Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J.
Solove Research Institute. Money will also go to the Wexner
Center for the Arts and other purposes, the school said.  Wexner, 73, graduated with a degree in business
administration from Ohio State in 1959, the university said.
Four years later, he opened his first clothing store in
Columbus, where Limited Brands is still based. The company,
which owns the Victoria’s Secret chain, had sales of $8.63
billion in the year ended Jan. 30, 2010. Wexner and the Limited
Foundation have donated, raised or pledged almost $200 million
for Ohio State, the university said.  “But for Ohio State, I would never have been able to go to
college,” Wexner said in the statement. I love Ohio State and
all the good it does.”  Founded in 1870, Ohio State has 64,077 students. Graduates
include Ohio Governor John Kasich and Archie Griffin, a former
football player who is the only two-time Heisman Memorial Trophy
Award winner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
