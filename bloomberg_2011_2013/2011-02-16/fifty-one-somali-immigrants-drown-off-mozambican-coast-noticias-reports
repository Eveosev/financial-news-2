At least 51 passengers aboard a boat
carrying 129 illegal Somali immigrants drowned last week off the
Mozambican coast in northern Cabo Delgado province, the Noticias
newspaper reported today, citing police spokesman Pedro Cossa.  The boat pilot, a Mozambican who was trying to illegally
transport the Somalis between Mozambique and  Tanzania , was among
the dead, Cossa said, according to the newspaper.  The survivors were sent to Maratane refugee camp in
northern Nampula province, the Maputo-based daily said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
