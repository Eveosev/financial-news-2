Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said New York will remain at the center of the global
financial system long after the planned purchase of the New York
Stock Exchange’s parent company by  Deutsche Boerse AG .  Geithner, speaking to the Senate Finance Committee, said
today the NYSE is “in some ways the world’s iconic stock
exchange.” He was responding to Senator Charles Schumer, a New
York Democrat, who said a combined exchange should list the NYSE
name first.  “I don’t make that judgment ultimately,” Geithner said
when asked by Schumer if he agreed. Geithner said he thinks the
enlarged company will “decide as you suggested.” New York
“will remain at the center” of the global financial system for
“a long time to come,” he said.  Deutsche Boerse agreed to buy NYSE Euronext this month in a
$9.53 billion all-stock deal that would create the largest owner
of equities and derivatives markets.  NYSE Euronext  is the parent
company of the New York Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
