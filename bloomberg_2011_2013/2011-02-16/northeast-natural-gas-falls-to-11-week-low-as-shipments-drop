Natural gas for next-day delivery at
the Transco-Z6 hub in the U.S. Northeast fell to the lowest
price in more than 11 weeks as warmer-than-normal reduced demand
for the heating fuel.  Gas prices at the hub, which delivers the fuel to the New
York City region, dropped 3.1 percent. Scheduled gas deliveries
to  New York  residents tumbled 18 percent, the biggest decline
since Sept. 9, according to Bloomberg data.  “You’ve got warm weather coming in the next couple of days
so heating demand won’t be as strong as in the first half of the
month,” said  James Williams , an economist at WTRG Economics, an
energy research firm in  London , Arkansas.  Wholesale gas for next-day delivery at the hub declined
14.8 cents to $4.6386 per million British thermal units on the
Intercontinental Exchange, the lowest level since Nov. 29. Gas
at the Tetco-M3 hub, which also transports gas to the New York
area, slid 1.3 percent to $4.2095.  About 3 million dekatherms of gas (2.92 billion cubic feet)
were to be delivered to residences in New York as of 2:05 p.m.,
down from yesterday’s 3.67 million, Bloomberg data showed.  Scheduled shipments for residential use in the U.S.
declined 14 percent to 33.9 million dekatherms, the lowest level
since Nov. 22.  Temperature Forecasts  Temperatures will be as much as 14 degrees Fahrenheit above
normal in the U.S. East, Midwest and South through Feb. 20,
according to Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland .  The high temperature in New York will be 55 degrees
Fahrenheit (13 Celsius) tomorrow, 14 degrees above normal,
according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania.
The high will be 63 degrees on Feb. 18.  Heating demand will be 22 percent below normal levels in
the Northeast through Feb. 23, according to Weather Derivatives
in Belton, Missouri.  Gas for next-day delivery at the  Henry Hub  in Erath,
Louisiana, gained 1.19 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $3.9335. The
hub is the benchmark for gas futures traded on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
