  Nigeria  ceded control of Olorunshogo
Power Plant, located in the western Ogun state, to a group led
by Sepco III Electric Power Construction Corp. of  China ,  ThisDay 
reported, citing Nuhu Wya, minister of state for power.  The handover followed Nigeria’s failure to repay the 65
percent funding for the 335-megawatt plant provided by Sepco
III, the Lagos-based newspaper said, without saying the total
cost.  The Nigerian government last year decided to cede its
controlling stakes in electricity generation and distribution to
private investors. Blackouts are common in Nigeria, Africa’s
most populous nation, as demand for power outstrips supply.  To contact the reporter on this story:
