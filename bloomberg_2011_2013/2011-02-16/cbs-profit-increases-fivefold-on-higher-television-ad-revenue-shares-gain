U.S. television network, posted fourth-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates on higher television advertising sales.  Net income increased almost fivefold to $283 million, or 41
cents a share, from $58.8 million, or 9 cents, a year earlier,
New York-based CBS said today in a statement. Excluding items,
profit of 46 cents beat the 43-cent average of 19 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Advertisers are restoring marketing budgets after cutting
spending during the longest U.S. recession since the Great
Depression. Time Warner Inc., Viacom Inc. and Walt Disney Co.

stations and  broadcast network  also gained from fees collected
from pay-TV operators that carry their signals.  “Given the growing value of content, the trends in our
business and the media landscape as a whole, we expect these
results to continue for a long, long time,” Chief Executive
Officer Leslie Moonves said on a conference call.  Sales gained 11 percent to $3.9 billion, topping the $3.85
billion average of 16 analysts’ estimates.  CBS, controlled by Chairman  Sumner Redstone , rose 20 cents
to $22.30 in extended trading. The stock gained 45 cents to
$22.10 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading
and has risen 16 percent this year.  The company will continue to cut costs and repurchase
shares under a $1.5 billion buyback program, Moonves said.  Ad Revenue  Total ad sales increased 12 percent on growth in local and
national spending, including higher political outlays, CBS said.
Content licensing and distribution revenue climbed 21 percent,
reflecting gains from “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation”
episodes and international markets.  Revenue from Showtime and the CBS College Sports Network
division grew 6 percent to $368.3 million as the two networks
added subscribers. Showtime, which also includes The Movie
Channel and Flix, had 67.1 million subscribers, 5.8 million more
than a year earlier, the company said. CBS College Sports had
39.1 million subscribers, a 4.3 million gain from 2009.  (CBS began a conference call at 4:30 p.m. New York time at
