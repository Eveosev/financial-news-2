  RWE AG  said it started its fuel oil-
fired Fawley power station in south England today as part of
‘routine testing’.  The plant’s two 485-megawatt units were both producing at
full capacity by around 3:30 p.m. local time before reducing
generation, according to  National Grid Plc  data.  “This is just routine testing which will be over pretty
quickly,” Verity Barr, a spokeswoman for RWE’s U.K. business
Npower, said in an e-mail.  Britain has three oil-fed power stations which are usually
only switched on at times of insufficient supplies. They are
more costly to run than coal and natural-gas plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
