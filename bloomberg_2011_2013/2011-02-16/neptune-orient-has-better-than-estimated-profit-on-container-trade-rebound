Neptune Orient Lines Ltd.,  Asia ’s
second-biggest container line, posted a better-than-estimated
fourth-quarter profit as rebounding global trade boosted rates
and volumes.  Net income was $177 million in the three months ended Dec.
31 compared with a loss of $211 million a year earlier, the
Singapore-based company said today in a stock exchange
statement. The shipping line was expected to post a $75 million
profit based on the average of four analyst estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. Sales rose 37 percent to $2.8 billion.  The company’s container volumes grew 13 percent as economic
recoveries in the U.S. and  Europe  drove up demand for furniture,
clothes and electronics made in Asia. The shipping line and
larger rival  Evergreen Group  also ordered new vessels last year
as demand rebounded following the end of the global recession.  “Volumes have held up better than earlier expected amid
growing demand from major economies,” said Um Kyung A, an
analyst at Shinyoung Securities Co. in  Seoul . “The shipping
lines also have become more prudent in managing capacity.”  Neptune Orient’s  APL Ltd.  unit carried 829,000 40-foot
equivalent containers in the fourth quarter, according to the
statement. Average revenue per box climbed 24 percent to $2,757.
The unit’s sales rose 40 percent to $2.4 billion.  Demand Slowdown  Demand growth may slow this year after a post-recession
surge in 2010, Chief Executive Officer Ron Widdows told
reporters in Singapore. Shipping lines may able to slow more
vessels to curb capacity amid the weaker growth and to offset
rising fuel prices, he said.  “There will be some moderation in growth in overall
trade,” Widdows said. Global container trade may expand 9.7
percent this year, after jumping 13.5 percent in 2010, according
to  Clarkson Plc , the world’s biggest shipbroker.  NOL, controlled by state-investment fund Temasek Holdings
Pte, gained 1 percent to close at S$2.13 in Singapore today
before the earnings announcement. The company has risen 29
percent in the past 12 months, compared with a 12 percent gain
for the city-state’s benchmark Straits Times Index.  The shipping line has the capacity it needs for this year
and it isn’t due to receive any new vessels in the period,
Widdows said.  The company is scheduled to accept 10 ships next year, 10
in 2013 and two in 2014. It placed orders for 12 ships valued at
about $1.2 billion last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
