  Hermes International  SCA wants  LVMH
Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA  to reduce its stake by more than
half to free up shares on the open market, according to the head
of the Birkin bag maker’s founding family.  With the family controlling more than 70 percent of Hermes
stock, “it’s not normal” that LVMH Chief Executive Officer  Bernard Arnault  should hold 20.2 percent of the shares, Bertrand
Puech said in an interview in Paris yesterday. “We want him to
reduce his stake to less than 10 percent.”  LVMH won’t be a passive investor in Hermes and can provide
its Paris-based competitor with strategic and operational help,
Arnault said Feb. 4. The world’s largest luxury goods maker
doesn’t plan to sell its Hermes stake, Chief Financial Officer
Jean-Jacques Guiony said at the time.  If LVMH doesn’t reduce its stake, “it means we end up with
a shareholder we don’t like and we don’t want,” Puech said.
“Nothing will change” regarding the running of the company.  LVMH announced Oct. 23 it held a 14.2 percent stake in
Hermes and derivative instruments for another 2.9 percent that
it has since exercised. LVMH acquired an additional 3.1 percent
of the company in December.  “There has been no contact” between the companies since
Oct. 25 when Puech and Hermes Chief Executive Officer Patrick Thomas met Arnault and LVMH vice-chairman Pierre Gode, Puech
said. “We’ve given no instruction to our advisers to meet with
LVMH.”  To contact the reporter on this story:  Andrew Roberts  in Paris at
