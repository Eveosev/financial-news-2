Defending champion Inter Milan beat
Fiorentina 2-1 to move to within five points of Italian Serie A
soccer leader AC Milan.  Giampaolo Pazzini struck the winning goal in the 62nd
minute in Florence as Inter rebounded from its 1-0 loss at
Juventus four days ago. Inter had taken the lead through Michele
Camporese’s own goal before Manuel Pasquale tied it for
Fiorentina.  Inter’s eighth win in 10 league matches since Leonardo took
over as coach Dec. 24 lifted it into third place with 47 points
through 25 games. AC Milan has 52 atop the standings, ahead of
second-place Napoli on 49.  In last night’s other Serie A game, Rafinha scored the only
goal as Genoa beat city rival Sampdoria 1-0, a result that put
them 11th and 13th in the standings, respectively.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
