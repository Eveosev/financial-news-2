Swiss stocks climbed for a fourth
straight day, extending a 10-month high for the benchmark  Swiss
Market Index , as  Credit Suisse Group AG  and  UBS AG  led financial
shares higher.  Credit Suisse and UBS, Switzerland’s largest banks, rose
more than 1.5 percent as French rival Societe Generale SA
reported a fourfold increase in profit.  Clariant AG , the world’s
biggest maker of printing-ink chemicals, tumbled the most in
eight years after agreeing to buy Sued-Chemie AG.  The SMI of the biggest and most actively traded companies
gained 0.3 percent to 6,711.65 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Zurich,
having swung between gains and losses at least 10 times. The
gauge has increased 4.3 percent this year as investors bet that
the strengthening global economic recovery will help corporate
earnings. The broader Swiss Performance Index advanced 0.2
percent today.  Reports in the U.S. showed industrial production
unexpectedly dropped in January, while builders began work on
more homes than forecast.  “Societe Generale’s results were good for sentiment and
the financials are also helped by the figures on U.S. housing,”
said John Plassard, director at Louis Capital Markets in Geneva.
“Defensive stocks on the Swiss market tend not to do well when
the riskier equities gain.”  Banks Gain  Credit Suisse climbed 3.3 percent to 44.15 Swiss francs, a
third straight increase, and UBS added 1.7 percent to 18.80
francs, the highest since October 2009. Banks led gains across  Europe  after Societe Generale reported fourth-quarter profit
that exceeded analysts’ estimates.  Swiss Reinsurance Co., the world’s second-largest
reinsurer, gained 1.4 percent to 56 francs.  Zurich Financial
Services AG  advanced 2.2 percent to 274.3 francs.  Clariant slumped 13 percent to 15.15 francs, the biggest
drop since February 2003. The company agreed to buy private
equity-owned Sued-Chemie in a deal valued at 2 billion euros
($2.7 billion) to expand in chemical catalysts used in the oil
and automotive industries. Clariant said it plans to fund the
acquisition with 900 million francs ($935 million) of loans.  To contact the reporters on this story:
