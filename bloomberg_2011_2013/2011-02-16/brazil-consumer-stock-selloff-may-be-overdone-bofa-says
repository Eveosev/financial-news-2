Brazilian consumer stock declines
may be “overdone” as rising interest rates and inflation are
unlikely to squelch domestic demand, Bank of America Corp. said.  Brewer Cia. de Bebidas das Americas and retailers Lojas
Renner SA and  Lojas Americanas SA  are the bank’s “top picks”
after the recent selloff, according to a note to clients dated
yesterday from Robert Ford, a New York-based analyst.  To contact the reporter on this story:
