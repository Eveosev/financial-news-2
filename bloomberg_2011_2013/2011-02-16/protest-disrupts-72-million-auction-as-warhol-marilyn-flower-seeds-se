A pile of porcelain sunflower seeds,
an Andy Warhol painting of  Marilyn Monroe  and a  Gerhard Richter 
abstract sold last night at a London auction that was
interrupted by a protest at U.K. government cuts.    Sotheby’s  evening sale of contemporary art, which raised
44.4 million pounds ($72 million) with fees, briefly stalled
when more than 10 activists from the Arts Against Cuts group
unfurled a red banner reading “Orgy of the Rich’’ and threw
photocopied 50-pound notes at onlookers.  The disruption didn’t stop spending by the world’s rich art
collectors. Auction sales of contemporary works are recovering
after the financial crisis wiped as much as 50 percent off the
value of some pieces.  “There are new buyers in the market,’’ London-based dealer
 Stephen Friedman  said. “There was a lot of bidding from Russia
and Asia, some not very discriminating. Tonight did include some
good pieces. Overall, demand was strong.’’  The sale began with a pile of Ai Weiwei hand-painted seeds
of the same type that the Chinese artist has used to cover the
floor of  Tate Modern’s  Turbine Hall. The 100-kilogram mound sold
to one of three telephone bidders for 349,250 pounds, almost
tripling the high estimate of 120,000 pounds.  “There were 100,000 seeds in the pile, so that’s 3.50
pounds each,’’ Sotheby’s London-based specialist Alexander
Branczik said.  Multicolor Monroe  Warhol’s acrylic silkscreen “Nine Multicolored Marilyns
(Reversal Series)” sold to a Sotheby’s staff member taking bids
from an unidentified client in the room for 3.2 million pounds,
beating the upper estimate of 3 million pounds. Another version
of the work, which dates from 1979 to 1986, sold for 4.1 million
pounds at Christie’s International, London, at the height of the
market in June 2008.  Patti Wong, chairman of Sotheby’s  Asia , took the telephone
bids of the buyer of the 1990 Richter “Abstraktes Bild,” which
made the top price of 7.2 million pounds. The canvas, with white
and red oil paint applied with a squeegee, was valued at 5
million pounds to 7 million pounds. It had been acquired by a
U.S.-based collector for an undisclosed price from the San
Francisco-based dealer Anthony Meier in 2007. A minimum price
had been guaranteed by a Sotheby’s “irrevocable bid.”  The biggest surprise was the artist record 3.1 million
pounds paid by a German-based art adviser for the unique 1993
two-part bronze sculpture “Conversation Piece’’ by the Spanish
artist Juan Munoz. The life-size group of a mother and child had
been entered by a European collector who had owned it since 1993
and was estimated at as much as 800,000 pounds.  Russian Angel  Alina Davey, who works in Sotheby’s London-based client
services department, dealing with Russian clients, was a
frequent telephone bidder. She bought a 1987 Christopher Wool
painting for 409,250 pounds and a 2004 Takashi Murakami
painting, “Skulls Rock” at 493,250 pounds. A 3-foot-high
bronze version of Antony Gormley’s 1997 “Angel of the North”
fetched 623,650 pounds.  The auction had a presale estimate of as much as 43 million
pounds at hammer prices. All but five of 59 lots found buyers.
The total was down on the equivalent event last year, which
raised 54.1 million pounds from 77 lots with only three unsold.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
