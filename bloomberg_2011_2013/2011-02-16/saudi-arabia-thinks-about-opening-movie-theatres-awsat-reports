  Saudi Arabia , a conservative country
with a Sunni Muslim majority, is thinking about opening public
cinemas,  Asharq al-Awsat  reported, citing Prince Abdul Aziz Bin
Ayyaf Al Migrin, the mayor of Riyadh.  About 230,000 tourists traveled last summer from Saudi
Arabia to the neighboring  United Arab Emirates  to watch movies
in the cinemas, the newspaper said.  The  Secretariat of Riyadh Region  has no immediate plans to
start such facilities, Awsat added, citing Al Migrin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
