  PDL BioPharma Inc . said today it
will pay  AstraZeneca PLC ’s MedImmune unit $92.5 million to end a
claim that PDL collected too much in patent royalties on the
respiratory drug Synagis.  PDL said in a statement that it paid MedImmune $65 million
yesterday and will pay $27.5 million by Feb. 10, 2012. The
settlement covers all legal disputes between the two companies,
including those related to MedImmune’s Synagis and PDL’s
patents, PDL said.  PDL, based in Incline Village, Nevada, developed technology
related to antibodies and licenses its patents to biotechnology
companies for medicines targeting cancers and viruses. A federal
judge in January said a PDL patent was invalid and that
MedImmune wasn’t required to pay royalties on sales of Synagis
outside the U.S. by partner Abbott Laboratories.  With some issues still pending for trial, “it would have
been another year to two years before it was resolved,” Cris
Larson, a spokeswoman for PDL, said in an interview. “It seemed
preferable, given what else we want to accomplish, to get that
behind us.”  MedImmune sued PDL in 2008, seeking a ruling that Synagis
and a newer medicine called motavizumab didn’t use the PDL
technology. London-based AstraZeneca, which bought MedImmune in
2007, dropped development of motavizumab for infant respiratory
disease last year. MedImmune also was demanding repayment of
some of the royalties already paid, claiming it was overcharged.  Won’t Challenge PDL  As part of the agreement, MedImmune won’t challenge PDL on
the disputed patents or assist other companies seeking to
invalidate them. MedImmune, based in Gaithersburg,  Maryland ,
hasn’t paid royalties on Synagis since Sept. 30, 2009, and won’t
owe any more money, PDL said.  The settlement is “a major overhang removed and a
satisfactory ending to an unfortunate turn of events,”  Jason Kantor , an analyst with  RBC Capital Markets  in  San Francisco ,
said in a note to clients. He said PDL could have owed MedImmune
$140 million to $280 million.  PDL fell 19 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $5.25 at 9:59 a.m.
New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  The case is MedImmune LLC v. PDL Biopharma, 08cv5590, U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of  California  (San
Jose).  To contact the reporter on this story:
