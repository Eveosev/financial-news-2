A U.S. regulator’s plan to take into
account alternate-energy requirements when approving new  power
lines  is encouraging, the president of National Grid Plc’s U.S.
business said today.  The  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  is preparing rules
for how transmission lines are planned and funded and has
signaled a greater role for regional planning that incorporates
state requirements for renewable fuel use. National Grid
executives have met agency officials to discuss the process.  “I feel very encouraged and didn’t see any weakness in
their desire to continue to move forward,” Tom King, U.S.
president for London-based National Grid, said at a breakfast
with reporters today in Washington.  National Grid operates in  New England , where goals for
using renewable fuel have gained support as a way to reduce the
region’s reliance on imported oil. The company in January said
it plans to cut 1,200 U.S. jobs, saving $200 million a year.  National Grid’s planned $5.5 billion in spending this year
includes $2 billion in the U.S., part of an effort to increase
its focus on its U.S. business, Chief Executive Officer Steven Holliday told reporters at the breakfast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
