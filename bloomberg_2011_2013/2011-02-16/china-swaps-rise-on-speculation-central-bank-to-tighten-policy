  China ’s interest-rate swaps rose for
a second day on speculation the central bank will tighten
monetary policy further to tame inflation.  The People’s Bank of China raised borrowing costs for the
third time in four months last week and has boosted lenders’
reserve-requirement ratios four times since October. Consumer
prices rose 4.9 percent from a year earlier in January, holding
above the central bank’s target of keeping gains within 4
percent, government data showed yesterday.  “There’s fear of a further reserve-requirement ratio hike
after yesterday’s CPI data,” said Pin Ru Tan, a Singapore-based
strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. She expects an
increase by the end of the month.  The one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, climbed five
basis points to 3.86 percent. The repo rate, a gauge of fund
availability in the financial system, slipped five basis points
to 2.59 percent, according to a daily fixing from the National
Interbank Funding Center in  Shanghai .  The Ministry of Finance sold five-year bonds at an average
yield of 3.6 percent today, according to a statement on the
website of the Chinese bond clearing house. That compares with
the 3.64 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of
15 finance companies.  The yield on the government’s 3.77 percent bond due
December 2020 rose three basis points to 4.07 percent, according
to Chinabond, the nation’s biggest debt-clearing house. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
