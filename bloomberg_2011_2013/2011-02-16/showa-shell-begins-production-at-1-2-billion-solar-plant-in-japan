Solar Frontier, a unit of Japanese
refiner Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K., said it began production at a
100 billion yen ($1.2 billion) solar module factory.  The factory, which Solar Frontier said is the world’s
biggest, has the capacity to produce 900 megawatts of thin-film
solar modules a year, the company said in a  statement  dated
yesterday.  Thin-film modules, used to turn sunlight into power,
require less material to produce than traditional modules.  The factory in Miyazaki prefecture, southern Japan is
expected to reach full production this summer, the statement
said. Tokyo-based Showa Shell shares fell 1.8 percent to 698 yen
at the 11 a.m. break on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The company is
Japan’s fourth-largest refiner by capacity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
