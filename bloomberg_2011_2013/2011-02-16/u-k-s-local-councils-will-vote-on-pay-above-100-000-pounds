Elected representatives on U.K.
local councils will have to hold a vote before paying staff more
than 100,000 pounds ($162,000) a year under cost-cutting plans
set out by Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s government.  A  study of local-authority pay by Incomes Data Services 
published Feb. 14 found that 43 percent of council chiefs earn
more than 150,000 pounds a year. Cameron’s salary was 142,500
pounds in 2010.  Communities Secretary Eric Pickles told BBC Radio 4’s
“Today” show he saw the proposal as a means to force councils
to look for other ways of saving money than by cutting public
services. After the government said Dec. 13 that the amount of
money it transfers to councils will fall by an average 4.4
percent, some responded by announcing staff reductions and the
closure of services such as libraries.  “This is just part of the checks and balances so that it
allows every councilor to consciously make a decision with
regard to senior pay,” Pickles said. “It just seems to me to
be a reasonable thing to do.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
