European Union regulators will
review competing restructuring plans for WestLB AG, the state-
owned lender bailed out during the financial crisis, from the
bank’s board and the German government.  German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  proposed the
bank transfer its non-saleable assets to a so-called bad bank
and sell the rest of its portfolio, EU Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  said in an e-mailed statement today. Savings
banks would take over the rest of the bank, he said. WestLB  Germany ’s third-largest state bank, said yesterday that its
separate restructuring plan would reduce assets by about one-
third by 2015 and split
into four business segments that could be sold off.  “I will be in contact with the federal government in the
coming days to discuss the next steps,” Almunia said. “WestLB
is under a restructuring obligation as a result of having
received state support since the beginning of the financial
crisis.”  WestLB had to propose extra restructuring measures by
midnight yesterday to seek EU approval for government help it
received last year. The European Commission in 2009 ordered
WestLB to sell itself by the end of 2011 and to sell its real-
estate unit WestImmo by the end of 2010. WestLB missed the
WestImmo sale deadline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
