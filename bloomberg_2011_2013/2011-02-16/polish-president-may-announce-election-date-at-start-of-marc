Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski may announce the date of this year’s general election
at the beginning of next month, a top aide said.  Komorowski will consult the government, political parties
and non-governmental organizations at the end of this month and
is likely to “announce his decision” on the date at the
beginning of March, Slawomir Nowak, a minister in the
president’s chancellery, said on Station III radio today.  The elections are likely to take place in October, Nowak
said. Prime Minister  Donald Tusk  faces re-election this year as
the popularity of his Civic Platform wanes after four years in
power.  Economists have criticized Tusk’s plans to reduce employee
transfers to private pension funds, while the opposition has
called the government “morally responsible” for last year’s
plane crash in which President  Lech Kaczynski  died.  Poland  will
hold the European Union’s rotating presidency in the second half
of this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
