A shipment of Iranian weapons seized
in  Nigeria  didn’t breach any law, according to a lawyer
representing an Iranian national charged with illegally
importing them.  “The arms were passing through  Nigeria  to Gambia,” Chris
Uche told reporters outside the court in Lagos, the commercial
capital, where the trial resumed today. “Under international
maritime law you are allowed to tranship.”  The shipment of rockets, grenades and mortars intercepted
in October “was a normal business transaction between two
sovereign countries” and the third to have passed through
Nigeria to Gambia, he said.  Azimi Aghajani, an Iranian national, and Nigerian Aliyu
Jega are facing trial for illegally shipping the weapons into
the West African country.  French shipping company CMA CGM SA said on Oct. 30 that an
Iranian company used one of its vessels to illegally transport
the arms to Lagos after labeling them as “packages of glass
wool and pallets of stone.”  A United Nations team visited the country on Jan. 18 to
probe the shipment of weapons, according to the Nigerian Foreign
Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
