Kenya’s shilling strengthened
against the  U.S. dollar  as increased sales of the country’s main
agricultural crops boost foreign-currency supplies.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy gained as
much as 0.5 percent to 81.05 per dollar and was trading at 81.45
shillings at 2:33 p.m. in Nairobi, the capital, today, unchanged
from yesterday.  The shilling “strengthened against the dollar due to the
strong inflows from tea and coffee following strong sales of tea
after calm returned to  Egypt , the main buyer of Kenya’s tea,”
Steve Lagat, a dealer at Nairobi-based CFC Stanbic Bank, said in
a phone interview today.  African tea prices rose for the first week in four,
climbing 3.3 percent to an average of $2.79 kilogram at a weekly
sale in Mombasa, Kenya, Tea Brokers East Africa Ltd. said in an
e-mailed statement yesterday. Political unrest in Egypt, which
led to the resignation of President  Hosni Mubarak  on Feb. 11,
weakened the shilling as demand for tea in the North African
country declined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
