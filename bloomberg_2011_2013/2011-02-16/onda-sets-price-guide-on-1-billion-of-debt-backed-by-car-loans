Honda Motor Co. set price guidance
on $1 billion of bonds backed by auto loans, according to a
person familiar with the offering.  A top-ranked, $155 million slice with a weighted average
life of 2.99 years may pay about 30 basis points more than the
interpolated swaps rate, said the person, who declined to be
identified because terms arenâ€™t public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
