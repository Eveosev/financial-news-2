  Russia  is abandoning a plan to build
a Balkan pipeline that bypasses Turkey’s crowded Bosporus
Strait, Vedomosti reported, citing unnamed officials from the
pipeline joint venture and its shareholders.  The Russian partners in the operator Trans Balkan Pipeline
B.V., OAO Transneft, OAO Rosneft and OAO Gazprom Neft, will
officially end their financing of the project at a  shareholders’
meeting  in Rome tomorrow, Vedomosti cited the officials as
saying. This effectively buries the pipeline plan, the Moscow-
based newspaper said.  Russia, Bulgaria and  Greece  agreed in 2007 to build the
285-kilometer (177 mile) oil pipeline from the Bulgarian Black
Sea port of Burgas to the Greek port of Alexandroupolis on the
Aegean Sea. The 1 billion-euro ($1.4 billion) link, with a
capacity of 35 million metric tons of oil a year, would bypass
the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits, saving shipping costs.  The project competes with a similar $2.5 billion pipeline
agreed between Russia, Italy and  Turkey  last year to carry oil
from the Turkish Black Sea port of Samsun to the Mediterranean
port at Ceyhan.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
