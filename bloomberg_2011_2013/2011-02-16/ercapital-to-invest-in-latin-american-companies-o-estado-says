Spanish private equity fund
Mercapital SL plans to invest 400 million euros ($540 million)
in Latin American companies to diversify spending outside its
domestic market, O Estado de Sao Paulo said, citing Chairman
Javier Loizaga.  Mercapital plans to finance Spanish companies that want to
buy stakes in Latin American firms focused on consumer goods,
health and infrastructure, the newspaper said. Three possible
deals are in the due diligence stage, Loizaga told Estado,
without elaborating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
