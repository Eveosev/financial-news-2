Two gunmen in  Nigeria  suspected of
involvement in a failed abduction attempt in the southern city
of Warri were attacked and killed by a mob, according to a
police official.  Residents in the Eboh district of the city confronted the
gunmen today when they attempted to abduct a woman, Charles
Muka, Delta state police spokesman, said by phone. While other
members of the gang fled, two were caught and killed, he said.  Warri is a port and important base for international oil
companies including Royal Dutch Shell Plc and  Chevron Corp . that
operate in the western part of Nigeria’s oil-rich delta.
Militant groups that target the industry and criminal gangs that
kidnap for ransom have been active in the city in the past
decade. Nigeria is  Africa ’s top oil producer and the fifth-
biggest source of U.S. oil imports.  To contact the reporters on this story:
