Army General David Petraeus’s
assignment as head of U.S. and NATO forces in  Afghanistan  won’t
end “anytime soon,” a Pentagon spokesman said in response to a
report the commander may leave at the end of this year.  Petraeus, who has led the coalition under the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization since July 2010, will be replaced
by the end of the year, the London-based Times reported.  “Despite some sensational speculation by one of the London
papers, I can assure you General Petraeus is not quitting” as
commander, “but nor does he plan to stay in Afghanistan
forever,”  Geoff Morrell , spokesman for the Pentagon, said in an
e-mail.  “Obviously he will rotate out at some point, but that
point has not yet been determined and it will not occur anytime
soon,” Morrell said. “Until then, he will continue to ably lead
our coalition forces in Afghanistan.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
