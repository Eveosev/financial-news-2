The number of applications for U.S.
mortgages fell last week to the lowest level in more than two
years as higher borrowing costs depressed refinancing.  The  Mortgage Bankers Association ’s index of loan
applications decreased 9.5 percent in the week ended Feb. 11,
dropping to the lowest point since November 2008. The group’s
refinancing measure slumped 11 percent to the weakest point
since July 2009, and the purchase gauge fell 5.9 percent.  The average rate on 30-year fixed mortgages exceeded 5
percent for a second week, the first time that’s happened since
April, on signs the economy is improving. Mounting foreclosures
and unemployment at or above 9 percent since May 2009 also are
hampering any rebound in housing.  “Rising interest rates may dampen any potential housing
recovery,”  Scott Buchta , head of investment strategy at Braver
Stern Securities LLC in  Chicago , said before the report. “The
recent rise in  mortgage rates  has also made it uneconomical for
the majority of homeowners to refinance their mortgages.”  The average rate on a 30-year fixed loan fell to 5.12
percent from 5.13 percent the prior week. The rate reached 4.21
percent in October, the lowest since the group’s records began
in 1990.  At the current 30-year rate, monthly payments for each
$100,000 of a loan would be $544, or about $11 more than the
same week the prior year, when the rate was 4.95 percent.  The average rate on a 15-year fixed mortgage rose to 4.34
percent from 4.29 percent.  Less Refinancing  The share of applicants seeking to refinance a loan fell to
64 percent, the lowest level since May, from 66.6 percent the
prior week.  The housing market is struggling to gain traction after a
home buyers’ tax credit expired last year and as more properties
fall into the foreclosure pipeline. Combined sales of existing
and new homes in December were at a 5.6 million annual unit
pace, down from a July 2005 peak of 8.5 million.  A Commerce Department report today at 8:30 a.m. may show
housing starts in January rose to a 539,000 pace from a one-year
low of 529,000 the prior month, according to the median forecast
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. .  “The issue is unemployment, fear and lack of confidence,
and that’s what’s got to turn right now,”  Ara Hovnanian , chief
executive officer of  New Jersey ’s largest homebuilder, said Feb.
14 on Bloomberg Television’s “Surveillance Midday” with  Tom Keene .    Hovnanian Enterprises Inc . on Dec. 22 reported a fourth-
quarter loss bigger than analysts expected as revenue fell 19
percent. The company has cut about 75 percent of its workforce
in the past four years, Hovnanian said during the interview. He
said he expects the industry “to start building some momentum”
in the second quarter.  The Washington-based Mortgage Bankers Association’s loan
