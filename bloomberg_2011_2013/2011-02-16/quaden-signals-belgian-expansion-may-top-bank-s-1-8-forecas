Belgian National Bank Governor  Guy Quaden  signaled the central bank may increase its forecast for
2011 economic growth in June after Belgian business confidence
improved for a seventh month in January.  “The latest forecast of the  National Bank of Belgium  was
1.8 percent, published at the beginning of December,” Quaden
told reporters in Brussels on Feb. 14. “Since then, the news
was good, in particular the latest confidence surveys.” His
comments were embargoed until today.  Belgium’s economy, the sixth-largest in the euro region,
expanded an estimated 2 percent last year, the central bank
said. The bank cut its forecast from 2.1 percent on Dec. 6 as
inventories unexpectedly shrank for a second year, offsetting a
larger-than-previously-forecast contribution from an export
recovery. The nation could record “annual growth of 2 percent
twice,” Quaden said, referring to the latest forecast by the
federal planning bureau.  Faster economic growth may help  Belgium ’s caretaker
government reach its target for a budget deficit of less than
4.1 percent of gross domestic product this year. Spending cuts
are necessary to prevent government expenditure from rising at a
faster pace than GDP and to prepare the nation for the mounting
cost of an aging population, the national bank said.  Belgium will probably need to raise additional revenue to
balance its budget in 2015, as agreed with the European
Commission, and should broaden its fiscal base by reviewing all
corporate and personal income tax exemptions, the bank said in
its annual report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
