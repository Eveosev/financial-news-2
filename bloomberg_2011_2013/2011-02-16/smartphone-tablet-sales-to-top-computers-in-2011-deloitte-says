Global sales of smartphones and
tablets will be higher than sales of computers for the first
time in 2011, said Duncan Stewart, director of Deloitte’s
technology, media and telecommunications research unit.  About 390 million personal computers, laptops and netbooks
will be sold this year, compared with 425 million smartphones
and tablets, Stewart said at a conference in Istanbul today,
where he presented a Deloitte report with forecasts for 2011.  Shipments of tablet computers may jump sixfold in two years
to 101 million units in 2012, undermining sales of video-game
players and traditional personal computers, Morgan Stanley said
Feb. 14. The shipments may increase to 65 million in 2011 from
16 million last year.  “The 2011 computing market will be dominated by devices
that use different processing chips and operating systems than
those used for PCs over the past 30 years,” Stewart said.  Deloitte predicts  that in 2011 more than 25 percent, or
more than 10 million, of all tablet computers will be bought by
enterprises and that figure is likely to rise in 2012 and
beyond, Stewart said.  “In the non-PC world, although app adoption is still in
its infancy, the industry is forecast to enjoy 60 percent growth
in 2011 to over $10 billion,” he said.  Many mobile-phone operators may postpone plans to switch to
so-called fourth-generation services offering wireless fast-data
transfers as equipment needed for 4G is still expensive, Stewart
said. “Service providers may still prefer 3.5G because its
performance is close to what 4G offers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
