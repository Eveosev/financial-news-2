Malaysia’s ringgit gained for a
second consecutive trading day after data in the U.S. and  China 
boosted the outlook for exports to the Asian nation’s biggest
overseas markets.  A report from the Federal Reserve today may show U.S.
industrial production increased for a third month in January,
according to a Bloomberg News survey. Chinese data on Feb. 14
showed imports surged 51 percent last month, beating all 21
estimates in a Bloomberg survey. China and the U.S. accounted
for about 23 percent of Malaysian exports last year. Bonds
dropped after the government sold more debt.  “China is still the bright spot for growth and a plus
factor for Asian economies,” said Choong Yin Pheng, manager for
economic and fixed-income research at Hong Leong Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “We still expect the ringgit to trade on a
stronger bias.”  The ringgit climbed 0.2 percent to 3.0470 per dollar as of
5 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, versus 3.0525 on Feb. 14, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Local financial markets were closed
yesterday for a public holiday. The currency may trade between
3.02 and 3.06 this week, Choong said.  Gross domestic product probably increased at an annual pace
of 4.6 percent last quarter, after expanding 5.3 percent in the
preceding three months, according to the median of 13 estimates
in a Bloomberg survey.  Bank Negara Malaysia  will report fourth-
quarter 2010 GDP on Feb. 18. Annual growth probably reached 7
percent last year after a 1.7 percent contraction in 2009, the
survey shows.  Bond Supply    Government bonds  dropped, pushing benchmark seven-year
yields to a one-week high. The treasury is scheduled to auction
Shariah-compliant notes maturing in August 2018 later this
month, according to its sale calendar.  The yield on the 4.012 percent note due September 2017
increased three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.74
percent, according to Bursa Malaysia. The price declined 0.2, or
2 ringgit per 1,000 ringgit face amount, to 101.55.  The government sold 3 billion ringgit from the sale of
seven- and 10-year Islamic bonds via direct sales to investors,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The sale is the first
tranche from a program to raise as much as 8.8 billion ringgit,
according to central bank data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
