  ING Bank Slaski SA , the Polish unit
of  ING Groep NV , said fourth-quarter profit climbed 59 percent
after provisions fell and interest income increased.  Net income rose to 191.7 million zloty ($66.1 million) from
120.8 million zloty a year earlier, the Warsaw-based bank said
today in a statement. That compares with the 196.8 million-zloty
mean estimate by four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Polish banks boosted their combined net income by 41 percent
to 11.7 billion zloty last year, according to the Financial
Markets Commission. Earnings growth may continue as the  International Monetary Fund  forecasts economic expansion of 3.7
percent this year, compared with 3.8 percent in 2010.  Slaski plans a dividend of 15 zloty per share after making
no payout in 2009. Net-interest income, the difference between
what the bank pays on deposits and what it charges for loans,
climbed 19 percent to 421.7 million zloty.  Provisions for bad loans fell 28 percent to 61.2 million
zloty, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
