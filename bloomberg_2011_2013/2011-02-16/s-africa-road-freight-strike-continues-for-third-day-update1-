A strike by South African freight
workers entered its third day as protesters stoned and looted
trucks and delivery vans in Gauteng’s East Rand area, police
said.  “If there is no consensus between workers and management,
we must expect more problems,” Mveli Nhlapo, a spokesman for
the Ekurhuleni Metro Police, said by phone from Johannesburg
today.  Strikers stole frozen food and wine from two trucks at a
railway station east of Johannesburg, Nhlapo said. Four people
were also hospitalized after the driver of a pickup truck
crashed into a taxi after strikers stoned the vehicle, he said.
No arrests have been made.    South Africa ’s Road Freight Employers’ Association is in
talks with labor unions to end the strike, Gabudi Ramakgolo, a
coordinator for the South African Transport & Allied Workers’
Union said in phone interview today. The four striking unions
are demanding a wage increase of 20 percent over the next two
years. Employers have offered two increases of 7.5 percent, the
South African Press Association reported yesterday.  The unions involved in the dispute are the Professional
Transport Workers Union, the Transport and Allied Workers Union,
the Motor Transport Workers Union and the Transport and Allied
Workers Union.  The strike threatens to harm a large section of local
industry, the South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry
said in a statement today. It condemned the strike as premature
and “ill-conceived.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
