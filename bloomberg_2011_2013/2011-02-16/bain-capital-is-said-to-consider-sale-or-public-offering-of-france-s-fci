  Bain Capital  LLC is weighing a sale
or an initial public offering of FCI, a French maker of
electrical connectors valued at about 1.6 billion euros ($2.2
billion), said three people with knowledge of the matter.    Goldman Sachs Group Inc . is advising Boston-based Bain on
options for FCI, said the people, who declined to be identified
because the talks are private. The private-equity firm is
weighing whether to dispose of FCI’s automotive unit and sell
shares of the rest of the company through an IPO, or to seek
offers for the entire business, the people said.  FCI makes connectors used to transmit power in cars, phones
and computers, and competes with  Amphenol Corp . and  Tyco
Electronics Ltd . Bain Capital purchased the company from French
nuclear-reactor maker Areva SA for 1.07 billion euros in 2005.  The company may attract strategic bidders and private-
equity firms, the people said. Bain is also considering listing
the company’s shares in Asia, where demand for connectors is
growing, they said.  Leveraged buyout firms such as Bain Capital pool money from
investors to buy companies, financing the purchases mostly with
debt, with the intention of selling them later for a profit. The
firms are resuming asset sales after the global financial crisis
brought deal-making to a near halt.  A spokesman for Bain Capital in London and a spokeswoman
for Goldman Sachs declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
