  Daimler AG , the world’s second-
largest maker of  luxury vehicles , forecast 2011 operating profit
“clearly” exceeding the 2010 level on record deliveries for
Mercedes-Benz vehicles.  Daimler reported 2010 earnings before interest and taxes of
7.27 billion euros ($9.85 billion) from a loss of 1.51 billion
euros a year earlier, the Stuttgart, Germany-based company said
today in a statement. The figure missed the average estimate of
7.64 billion euros, based on a Bloomberg survey of 11 analysts.
Full-year sales rose 24 percent to 97.8 billion euros.  Mercedes,  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG  and  Volkswagen AG ’s
Audi, the top three high-end carmakers, are targeting record
2011 sales on growing Chinese wealth and a U.S. spending
rebound. Daimler Chief Executive Officer Dieter Zetsche said
last month growth this year will be constrained by factory
limits rather than demand as customers snatch up the next
generation C-Class sedan.  The manufacturer, also the world’s largest truckmaker, fell
as much as 1.55 euros, or 2.8 percent, to 54.43 euros and was
down 2.5 percent as of 10:38 a.m. in Frankfurt trading. The
stock has gained about 50 percent since the end of 2009, valuing
the company at 57.9 billion euros.   Daimler reported fourth-quarter net income of 1.14 billion
euros, compared with a loss of 352 million euros a year earlier.
The figure missed the average estimate of 1.28 billion euros.
Sales rose 24 percent to 26.4 billion euros.  Dividend Payment  The manufacturer recommended a dividend of 1.85 euros per
share, reinstating the payout after canceling it in 2009 amid
uncertainty about auto markets following the global recession.  Daimler, which traces its roots to the first automobiles
invented by Carl Benz and Gottlieb Daimler in 1886, has revamped
the CLS luxury coupe and SLK roadster and upgraded the C-Class,
its best-selling model, with a new interior. The company will
also start rolling out four compact models, when it debuts an
overhauled B-Class later this year.  Tight vehicle supply is causing delivery delays in
Germany, as manufacturers shift cars to the U.S. and Chinese
markets, the world’s two biggest, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
said in a study released Feb. 4. Delivery times for build-to-
order cars in  Germany  have climbed to 12.9 weeks on average
compared with a typical waiting period of eight weeks, the
consulting firm said.  Daimler’s trucks unit, which makes Mercedes, Freightliner
and Fuso vehicles, aims to average a return on sales of 8
percent over the next three years after shutting plants in  Asia 
and  North America  during the recession. The company predicts
sales over the period to rise more than 40 percent to at least
500,000 vehicles, boosted by a new Indian model line.  Daimler yesterday appointed Christine Hohmann-Dennhardt, a
former constitutional judge, to a new management board post
overseeing compliance and legal affairs. She’s the first woman
board member in the company’s 125-year history. Daimler’s
supervisory board also extended the contract of Chief Financial
Officer Bodo Uebber through the end of 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
