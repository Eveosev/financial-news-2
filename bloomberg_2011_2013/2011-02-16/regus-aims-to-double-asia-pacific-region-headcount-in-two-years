  Regus Plc , the world’s largest
operator of serviced offices, plans to double its Asia-Pacific
headcount to 2,000 in about two years as demand for workstations
increases in the region.  Luxembourg-based Regus is recruiting about 50 to 60 people
in the region every month, Filippo Sarti, the company’s chief
executive officer for Asia-Pacific, said in an interview in  Hong
Kong  today.  Regus and rivals including the  Executive Centre  are betting
rising office rents in cities such as Hong Kong and  Shanghai 
will lure more businesses to switch to serviced offices from
traditional work spaces to cut cost. Using serviced offices,
which include access to meeting rooms and telecommunications and
administration support, helps businesses cut occupancy costs by
an average 50 percent, according to Sarti.  Regus, which operates 140 centers in the region in
countries including China, India and  Australia , is aiming to
grow the number to 500 “over a period of time,” said Sarti,
declining to be more specific. Globally, the number of centers
may reach 3,000 from the company’s current 1,100, he said.  The company’s Asia-Pacific business accounted for about a
quarter of its operating profit in 2009. The company in August
reported a 7.8 million-pound ($12.6 million) first-half loss for
2010 on restructuring charges.  To contact the reporters on this story:
