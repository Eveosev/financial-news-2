The  European Central Bank  said
financial institutions lodged 166.8 billion euros ($235 billion)
with it overnight, the most in more than a year.  Bank deposits were at the highest since Aug. 9, 2010, and
up from 151.1 billion euros on Sept. 2. Lenders borrowed 8
million euros from the ECB at the marginal rate of 2.25 percent.
The ECB currently lends banks unlimited liquidity in its
refinancing operations at the benchmark rate of 1.5 percent.  Banks are hoarding excess cash as the euro region’s
worsening sovereign-debt crisis makes them wary of lending to
other institutions. Deutsche Bank AG Chief Executive Officer
 Josef Ackermann  said yesterday that market conditions remind him
of late 2008 when New York-based Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
collapsed, sparking a global financial crisis.  “On one hand this is a sign that there are some tensions
in the  interbank market ,” said Jean-Francois Robin, a
strategist at Natixis SA in Paris. “On the other hand we can’t
draw too many conclusions because we are heading towards the end
of the reserve maintenance period and there is also a lot of
excess liquidity, so it would be normal to deposit it at the
ECB.”  ECB policy makers meet on Sept. 8 to decide on  interest
rates  amid concerns that the debt crisis will infect  Europe ’s
banking system. The costs of insuring European sovereign and
financial debt against default surged to records yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
