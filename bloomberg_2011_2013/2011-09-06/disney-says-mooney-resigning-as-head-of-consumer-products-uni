Walt Disney Co. (DIS) , the world’s largest
theme-park operator, said consumer products Chairman Andrew P. Mooney resigned to seek a leadership role at another company
after running the division for 12 years.  “I believe this is the perfect time to take that
experience into a leadership role with another organization and
corporate boards,” Mooney, 56, said today in a statement from
Burbank, California-based Disney. He wasn’t more specific.  The unit Mooney leaves, Disney’s  second smallest  ahead of
interactive media, has been a steady source of sales and profit
growth with toys and merchandise from Pixar’s “Cars” movies
and Marvel films. Earnings in the division jumped 32 percent in
the June quarter on a 13 percent revenue gain.  A native of  Scotland , Mooney is credited with
reinvigorating the Disney chain of stores and leading the
division that introduced the Disney Princesses and Disney
Fairies brands. He has led the unit since 1999 and has been
chairman since 2003.  Disney fell 68 cents to $31.78 at 2:06 p.m. in  New York 
Stock Exchange composite  trading . The shares had declined 13
percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
