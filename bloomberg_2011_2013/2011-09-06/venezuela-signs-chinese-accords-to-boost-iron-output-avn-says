Venezuelaâ€™s government signed three
contracts with Chinese companies to increase iron production in
the South American country, state news agency AVN  reported ,
citing Jose Khan, minister of basic industries and mining.  The agreements are valued at $470 million and include the
purchase of new mining equipment, a project to expand a port in
Bolivar state and the dredging of a navigation canal in the
Orinoco river so that larger ships can pass through, said AVN.  The works are scheduled to be completed in about 18 months
and will be financed with loans from Chinese funds, according to
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
