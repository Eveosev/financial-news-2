The  Federal Reserve  may buy $520
billion of longer-maturity Treasuries while selling shorter-term
 U.S. debt , pushing the 10-year yield to as low as 1.6 percent,
according to CRT Capital Group LLC.  The Fed’s $1.64 trillion of holdings of Treasuries includes
$520 billion of debt maturing in 2014 and sooner, which could be
sold and reinvested in securities due between 2018 and 2039 in
order to raise the duration of the central bank’s government
debt portfolio to 7.4 years from 4.9 years, CRT strategists
 David Ader  and  Ian Lyngen  wrote in a note to clients today.  “The market is pricing it in,” Stamford, Connecticut-
based Ader said in a telephone interview. “Things seem to be on
the edge of breaking down. The Fed feels it wants to do
something, or at least acknowledge it still has some tools in
its box to keep hope alive.”  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  has cited extending the
average maturity as one of monetary stimulus tools available to
policy makers to boost the economy and employment. Economists
with the Fed’s regional bank in  San Francisco  wrote in April
that “Operation Twist,” a 1961 initiative by the central bank
and President  John F. Kennedy ’s administration, where the Fed
sold short-term debt and bought securities with longer
maturities, produced a 0.15 percentage point reduction in long-
term Treasury yields.  The gap between two- and 10-year Treasury yields has
narrowed to 1.77 percentage points from 2.44 percentage points
at the end of July. Ten-year note yields fell one basis point
today to 1.97 percent after touching a record low of 1.9066
percent.  More Tools  Pacific Investment Management Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
and Royal Bank of Canada said they expect the central bank to
announce plans to raise the average maturity of its bond
portfolio by selling shorter-term debt and reinvesting proceeds
from maturing securities into longer-term bonds. The Fed
purchased $2.3 trillion of debt since 2008 in two previous
rounds of what’s become known as quantitative easing, or QE, to
drive rates lower and help spur growth.  The Fed has become the focus of speculation regarding
stimulative policies because any effort by the Obama
Administration to boost the economy with fiscal programs would
likely be opposed by Republicans in Congress, Ader said.  Payrolls were unchanged last month, the weakest reading
since September 2010, after an 85,000 gain in July that was less
than initially estimated, Labor Department data showed Sept. 2.
The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey called for a rise
of 68,000.  Economic Path  The economy expanded at a 1 percent pace in the second
quarter following a 0.4 percent gain in the first three months
of the year, the Commerce Department reported last month.
 Consumer spending  grew 0.4 percent, the smallest increase since
the last three months of 2009.  Traders drove the 10-year yield down by 0.46 percentage
point when the Fed announced its $300 billion round of
quantitative easing in March 2009 and the market pushed the 10-
year yield down about 0.65 percentage point in anticipation of
QE2, Ader and Lyngen wrote.  “Another 50 basis points to 65 basis points in the 10-year
sector would put yields on an approach to 1.60-1.75 percent,”
Ader and Lyngen wrote. “We’ve had 1.75% as a potential target
for this cycle and recent trends have only enhanced that
prospect.”  Treasuries had their best month in August since December
2008 during the worst turmoil of the financial crisis, returning
2.8 percent, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch bond
indexes. They have gained 8.1 percent so far this year, after a
5.9 percent gain in 2010 and a 3.7 percent decline in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
