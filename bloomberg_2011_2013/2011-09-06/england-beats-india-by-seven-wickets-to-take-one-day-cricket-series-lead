Captain  Alastair Cook  hit an
unbeaten 80 to lead England to a seven-wicket win over India in
the rain-shortened second game of their best-of-five one-day
cricket series.  England won with five balls remaining in the match, which
was shortened to 23 overs per side because of rain. Cook
combined with Craig Kieswetter for 67 runs and Ravi Bopara for
60 at the  Rose Bowl  in Southampton. Samit Patel finished 9 not
out as England reached 188-3 in response to Indiaâ€™s 187-8.  Tim Bresnan and Graeme Swann each took 3 wickets for the
home team. Ajinkya Rahane led India with 54 runs before being
caught and bowled by Swann.  India, which has several players including  Sachin Tendulkar 
go home injured, has yet to beat England on this tour. The first
one-day match was rained out. Three games remain in the series,
which ends Sept. 16 in Cardiff.  England already swept the four-match Test series and won a
Twenty-20 match.  To contact the reporter on this story:
