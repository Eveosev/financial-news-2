The rupee declined for a second day
on speculation  Europe ’s worsening debt crisis will sap demand
for emerging-market assets and after data showed growth in
 India ’s services industry slowed last month.  The Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to 53.8 in August from
58.2 in July, the slowest pace since June 2009, HSBC Holdings
Plc and Markit Economics said yesterday. A reading above 50
indicates an expansion. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of regional
stocks fell for a third day after the fifth electoral defeat for
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s party this year fueled concern
that support for bailing out indebted European nations is waning.  “Europe’s debt crisis is weighing on the market and it is
one of the major reasons the rupee is weakening,” said Naveen Raghuvanshi, a Mumbai-based currency trader at Development
Credit Bank Ltd. “It is impractical to think  India’s economy 
will continue to grow 8 or 9 percent.”  The rupee fell 0.3 percent to 46.1075 per dollar as of 9:23
a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency touched 46.15 earlier, the weakest level since Aug. 26.  Asia ’s third-largest economy expanded 7.7 percent last
quarter from a year earlier, the least since 2009, official data
showed on Aug. 30. Growth exceeded 8 percent in every quarter
last year.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 46.50 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 46.37
yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
