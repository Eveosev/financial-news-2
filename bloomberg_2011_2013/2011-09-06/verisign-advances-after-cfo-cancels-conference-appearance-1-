VeriSign Inc. (VRSN)  rose the most in more
than two years after Chief Financial Officer Brian Robins
cancelled a planned appearance at a financial conference
organized by Citigroup Inc.  The pullout fueled speculation that VeriSign, the biggest
operator of computers that direct  Internet traffic , may be
planning to announce a new chief executive officer, said Dan Cummins, an analyst at ThinkEquity LLC in New York, who has a
“buy” recommendation on the shares.  “The most important thing to remember is that the next
expected development was the naming of the new CEO,” Cummins
said. He said he hasn’t heard any substantiated speculation that
VeriSign is a takeover target.  VeriSign shares rose $1.45, or 4.8 percent, to $31.46 at
3:13 p.m.  New York  time on the Nasdaq Stock Market, after
earlier touching $3.14 for the biggest intraday gain since May
2009. The stock had dropped 8.1 percent this year before today.  Jeannie McPherson, a spokeswoman for Dulles, Virginia-based
VeriSign, said “there is no reason to report” why the
appearance was cancelled.  Founder Jim Bidzos became interim CEO in July 2008 when
former chief William Roper unexpectedly quit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
