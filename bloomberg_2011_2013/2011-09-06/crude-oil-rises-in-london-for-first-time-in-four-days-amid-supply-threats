Oil rose for the first time in four
days in  London  as a drop in the dollar following  Switzerland ’s
attempt to cap the value of its currency made raw materials more
attractive to investors.  Brent futures rose as much as 1.3 percent as the dollar
plunged after the  Swiss National Bank  said it’s setting a
minimum franc exchange against the euro. About 61 percent of oil
production and 46 percent of natural gas output from the Gulf of
Mexico has been shut in because of a storm, according to the
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement.
In  New York , prices traded near their lowest in a week amid
signs that the country’s crude inventories are rising.  “If the dollar falters that will help oil,” said
 Christopher Bellew , a senior broker at Jefferies Bache Ltd. in
London, who correctly predicted Brent would be capped at $120
this summer. “In spite of the dire state of western economies,
I think demand in  China  and other emerging nations, the
potential for hurricane shut-ins and unrest in the Middle East
means prices will go back up.”  Brent for October settlement rose as much as $1.39 to
$111.47 a barrel and was at $110.88 at 1:05 p.m. on the ICE
Futures Europe Exchange. West Texas Intermediate crude for
October traded on ICE in London was up 58 cents at $84.10 a
barrel. On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , WTI for October
delivery was at $84.55, down $2.41 from its Sept. 2 close
following yesterday’s Labor Day holiday. The dollar weakened as
much as 1.3 percent to $1.4278 against the euro.  Production Halts  About 858,935 barrels a day of oil production in the  Gulf
of Mexico  have been curtailed, the Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management, Regulation and Enforcement said yesterday on its
website. That compares with 843,223 barrels the day before.
About 2.44 billion cubic feet in daily gas production has been
shut in, compared with 2.35 billion yesterday.  Crude stockpiles held in floating-roof tanks at Cushing,
 Oklahoma , the delivery point for WTI oil, rose 2.4 percent on
Sept. 1 from Aug. 31, satellite images taken by Longmont,
Colorado-based DigitalGlobe Inc. showed. Inventories climbed
850,000 barrels to 35.6 million.  The Energy Department said last week that supplies,
including floating and fixed tanks, totaled 33.1 million barrels
as of Aug. 26. The Department will release this week’s stockpile
report on Sept. 8, a day late because of Labor Day.  U.S. oil futures have slumped 27 percent from this year’s
high of $114.83 on May 2 amid concern that a slowdown in world
growth will curb demand. The  Institute for Supply Management ’s
non-manufacturing index fell to 51 last month, the lowest since
January 2010, from 52.7 in July, according to the median  of 59
forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  Fighting in  Libya , which began in February, has reduced the
availability of light, sweet crude, or oil with low density and
sulfur content. The country’s output fell to 45,000 barrels a
day last month, according to Bloomberg estimates, compared with
1.6 million barrels the nation pumped in January.  To contact the reporters on this story:
