Jose Maria Alvarez-Pallete, who was
named  Telefonica SA (TEF) ’s head of Europe yesterday, said emerging
markets will be key for the telecommunications industry in the
next few years and his company should boost investment in
technology in Latin America.  “Latin America will continue to grow in the future as it’s
come out of the current crisis much stronger,” Alvarez-Pallete,
former chief of Latin American operations, said today at a
conference in Santander, Spain.  Telefonica, Spain’s biggest phone company, said yesterday
it’s folding its struggling domestic unit into a European
division and shuffled the heads of its regional businesses as it
tries to halt a slide in its stock. Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Cesar Alierta, 66, is counting on Latin American growth
to boost revenue, with Spain’s 21 percent unemployment rate
hampering its business in its domestic market.  Telefonica SA expects both revenue and profit from its
digital operations, including Tuenti and Jajah, to be a
“positive surprise” in the coming months, Alvarez-Pallete
said. The company will likely also benefit as well from a surge
in data traffic in emerging markets such as Brazil, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
