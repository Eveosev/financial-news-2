Higher than expected tax revenue and
steps to curb expenditure last quarter may help  India  meet its
fiscal deficit target for the year, the government said.  India received 1.82 trillion rupees ($40 billion) in gross
tax revenues in the three months through June, an increase of
25.9 percent from a year earlier, the Ministry of Finance said
in a quarterly review presented to parliament today. The
government said it had budgeted for a 17.3 percent increase.  The  Reserve Bank  of India has blamed the nation’s “large”
fiscal deficit for adding to price pressures in the $1.7
trillion economy. India’s inflation has exceeded 9 percent for
eight straight months, weathering 11 interest-rate increases
since mid-March 2010 even as higher borrowing costs crimp
consumer spending and contribute to a slowdown in growth.  Central bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said in May that
rising oil prices pose a risk to the government’s budget deficit
target. The administration caps diesel and kerosene prices.  The  finance ministry  issued guidelines in July telling
government officials to curtail foreign travel and barring
purchases of new government vehicles. It also cut the budget for
conferences by 10 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
