Dubai stocks rose for the first time
in three days, reversing earlier losses, after the Swiss central
bank set a ceiling on the franc’s exchange rate for the first
time in more than three decades.  Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES) , the  United Arab Emirates ’ biggest bank,
rose to the highest in seven weeks.  Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB) , the
biggest Shariah-compliant lender, gained. The Dubai Financial
Market General Index increased 0.4 percent to 1,485.02 at the 2
p.m. close in Dubai, after earlier falling as much as 0.5
percent. Qatar’s gauge gained 0.4 percent,  Kuwait ’s measure
strengthened 0.1 percent and  Abu Dhabi ’s index rose less than
0.1 percent.  “Markets traded on a marginally positive note after the
comment by the SNB that it will not tolerate a move stronger
than 1.2 francs per euro,” said Samer Darwiche, a financial
analyst at Gulfmena Investments in Dubai. “This comment sent
European stocks and the Euro into the positive territory.”  European stocks snapped the biggest two-day slide since
2008 after the Swiss central bank said it is prepared to spend
unlimited quantities of currency to preserve it above 1.20 per
euro. The franc depreciated at least 7.6 percent against all 16
of the most-active currencies monitored by Bloomberg. The Stoxx
Europe 600 Index rose as much as 1 percent before sliding 1.4
percent.  Policy makers are “aiming for a substantial and sustained
weakening of the franc,” the  Swiss National Bank  wrote in an e-
mailed statement today.  Emirates NBD gained 1.4 percent to 4.31 dirhams, the
highest since July 18. Dubai Islamic advanced 0.5 percent to
2.01 dirhams.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , the developer of the
world’s tallest tower in Dubai, climbed 0.4 percent, the first
increase in three days, to 2.84 dirhams.  The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200) , which tracks the biggest 200
companies in the Gulf, declined 0.3 percent. The Muscat
Securities Market 30 Index lost 1.1 percent, snapping a six-day
winning stretch, the longest since July.  Saudi Arabia ’s  Tadawul
All Share Index (SASEIDX)  retreated for a second day, dropping 0.5
percent. The Bahrain All Share Index was unchanged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
