A concentration of ownership among
Mauritius’s banks may create a risk of contagion in the
industry, said Rundheersing Bheenick, governor of the Bank of
Mauritius.  Some of the lenders have become “too large and too
diversified” for the central bank to supervise them
effectively, Bheenick said in a speech today in  Port Louis , the
capital.  “The top two banks, both local, have total combined assets
which exceed by more than 30 percent the combined assets of all
other 15 banks which have domestic operations,” he said. “This
may become a source of vulnerability and undermine financial
stability.”  The total assets of banks were 1.1 trillion rupees ($39
billion) by the end of July, according to data published on the
 central bank’s website .  Mauritius Commercial Bank and  State Bank  of Mauritius Ltd.
are the country’s largest local lenders by market value, with a
total weight of almost 40 percent in the 38-member SEMDEX index
gauge of stocks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Bank of Mauritius plans to ring-fence the domestic-
banking operations of the biggest commercial banks and subject
them to full supervision, he said.  “To achieve that, we shall move away from the current
bank-holding model to bank-subsidiary model. This will require
some re-structuring and re-engineering,” he said, without
providing details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
