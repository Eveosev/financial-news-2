Co. and Glencore International AG.  Fuel Oil  Glencore International Plc and Total SA each bought 20,000
metric tons of 180-centistoke fuel oil from PetroChina at a
premium of $3.50 a ton over benchmark prices, according to a
Bloomberg News survey of traders monitoring transactions on the
Platts window today. That was 50 cents lower than what buyers
paid yesterday.  Hin Leong Trading Pte bought 20,000 tons of 380-centistoke
fuel oil from the Chinese refiner at a premium of $3 a ton over
benchmark prices. That was lower than premiums of $4 to $4.25 a

8.7 percent, to $6.68 a barrel at 2:29 p.m.  Singapore  time,
according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. The spread
narrowed for the first time in nine trading sessions, ending the
longest period of declining margins since September 2009.  Middle Distillates  Brightoil sold 150,000 barrels of gasoil with 0.5 percent

$2.90 a barrel over prices of gasoil with 0.5 percent sulfur.  Gasoil’s crack spread over Dubai crude, a measure of
processing profit, fell 10 cents to $17.95 a barrel at 2:29 p.m.
Singapore time, according to data from PVM.  Light Distillates  Royal Dutch Shell Plc, the biggest buyer of 97-RON gasoline

$129.70 a barrel.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures fell
to $111.33 a ton at 6 p.m. Singapore time from $122.89 a ton at
