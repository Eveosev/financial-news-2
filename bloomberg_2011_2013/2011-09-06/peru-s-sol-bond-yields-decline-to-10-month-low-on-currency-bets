Peru ’s sol bonds rose, pushing
yields to a 10-month low, as investors bet higher metal prices
and rising foreign investment will spur gains in the Andean
nation’s currency.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 5.44 percent at 1:27 p.m. New York time,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest
yield since Nov. 5. The security’s price rose 0.28 centimo to
116.72 centimos per sol.  Peru’s sol rose to a three-year high of 2.7255 per dollar
last week after  Standard & Poor’s  increased the country’s credit
rating for the first time since 2008, spurring demand for the
nation’s financial assets. The currency may gain 4.8 percent
against the  U.S. dollar  by the end of next year on higher prices
for the country’s gold and silver exports and rising capital
inflows, Scotiabank Peru economist  Mario Guerrero  said in a note
to investors yesterday.  “The appreciatory trend in the currency is attracting
investors to sol bonds,” said Julio Villavicencio, head of
strategy at Banco de Credito del Peru, the country’s biggest
bank. “The upgrade gave investors a shot of confidence about
the outlook for Peru after the elections.”  A widening yield differential between Peruvian bonds and
U.S. Treasuries is also fueling demand for sol securities,
Villavicencio said.  The sol rose 0.1 percent today to 2.7270 per U.S. dollar,
from 2.7297 yesterday.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian  government
bonds  instead of U.S. Treasuries rose three basis points to 210,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
