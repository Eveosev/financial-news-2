Retired U.S. Army General David Petraeus, the former top commander of U.S. forces in Iraq and
 Afghanistan , was sworn in today as the 20th director of the
Central Intelligence Agency.  Vice President Joe Biden conducted the ceremony in the
Roosevelt Room of the White House. Petraeus succeeds Leon Panetta, who is now U.S. secretary of defense.  President  Barack Obama , who nominated the 58-year-old
general, cited his experience in working with the CIA on
counterinsurgency efforts while he was in a battlefield.  Petraeus, during his Senate confirmation, pledged to
maintain “relentless pressure” on al-Qaeda, drawing on his
military experience.  To contact the reporter on this story:
