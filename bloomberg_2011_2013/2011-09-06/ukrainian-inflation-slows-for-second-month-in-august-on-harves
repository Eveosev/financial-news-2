Ukraine’s inflation slowed for a
second month in August as a good harvest capped food prices.  The inflation rate declined to 8.9 percent from 10.6
percent in July, the lowest level since March, the state
statistics committee in the capital, Kiev, said today on its
 website . The median estimate of eight economists in a Bloomberg
survey was 9 percent. Prices fell 0.4 percent in the month after
falling 1.3 percent in July.  Declining food costs are helping Ukraine’s government to
keep inflation under 10 percent for a second year, which may
convince banks to help spur economic growth through lower
lending rates. Ukraine will probably produce more than 50
million tons of grain this year, compared with 39.2 million tons
last year, Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov  said yesterday.  “Inflation slowed down and will probably slow further in
September as Ukraine has a good harvest of grain and
vegetables,” Iryna Piontkivska, an economist at Troika Dialog
in Kiev, said before the release.  Producer prices, an early indicator of price trends, rose
20.3 percent from a year earlier and advanced 0.1 percent in the
month, the statistics committee said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
