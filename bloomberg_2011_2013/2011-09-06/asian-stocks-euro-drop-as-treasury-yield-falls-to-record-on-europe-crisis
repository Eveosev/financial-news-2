Stocks fell, sending  Europe ’s
benchmark index to a two-year low, while 10-year Treasury yields
slid to a record amid growing concern Europe’s debt crisis is
worsening. The franc sank the most since the euro’s creation as
the Swiss central bank set a ceiling on the  exchange rate .  The  Standard & Poor’s  500 pared losses during the day,
ending down 0.7 percent at 4 p.m. in  New York  following a
morning drop of as much as 2.9 percent. The Stoxx Europe 600
Index slipped 0.7 percent to the lowest level since July 2009.
The franc depreciated 7.9 percent versus the euro. Gold in
London lost 1.1 percent after earlier climbing 1.1 percent to
$1,921.15 an ounce, an all-time high. Ten-year Treasury yields
slid as much as eight basis points to 1.91 percent before
trimming declines to trade at 1.97 percent.  Stocks maintained losses even as a private report showed
U.S.  service industries  grew faster than the median forecast of
economists in a Bloomberg survey. Policy makers are “aiming for
a substantial and sustained weakening of the franc,” the  Swiss
National Bank  said in an e-mailed statement today, saying it’s
prepared to spend unlimited quantities of currency to preserve
it above 1.20 per euro after investors pursued the currency as a
haven.  “Everybody is watching what’s going on in Europe at this
point,” Madelynn Matlock, who helps oversee about $14.8 billion
at Huntington Asset Advisors in Cincinnati, said in a telephone
interview. “It’s starting to feel 2008-ish where there are nine
bad things to one good thing. The dreaded uncertainty is out
there. The concern about a global recession is edging higher.”  Service Industries  The  S&P 500  extended its three-day slide to 4.4 percent
selloff, remaining lower even after the Institute for Supply
Management’s index of non-manufacturing businesses increased to
53.3 in August from 52.7 a month earlier. A reading above 50
signals expansion and the median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of economists called for a reading of 51.  Bank of America Corp., General Electric Co., Hewlett-
Packard Co. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. slid at least 2.9 percent
to lead declines in 27 of 30 stocks in the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average . Financial shares led losses in nine of the 10 main S&P
500 groups.  The U.S. stock market was closed yesterday for the Labor
Day holiday, as global equities fell, Italian bonds dropped for
an 11th day and the cost of government and bank default
insurance rose to records amid concern about Europe’s debt
crisis.  The S&P 500 plunged 2.5 percent on Sept. 2, wiping out a
weekly advance, as a government report showing employment growth
stagnated stoked concern the economy may fall into a recession.
The index slid as much as 18 percent from a three-year high on
April 29 and sank 5.7 percent in August, the biggest monthly
drop since May 2010. Stocks trimmed losses at the end of last
month as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on Aug.
26 that the central bank has tools to stimulate growth.  Bank Shares  Financial shares sank 1.9 percent last week as the Federal
Housing Finance Agency sued lenders over residential mortgage-
backed securities. The S&P 500 Financials Index is down 22
percent this year through last week.  Bearish bets by investors using futures contracts on the
 S&P 500 Index (SPX)  increased to the highest level in almost four
years in the week ended Aug. 30, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Short
selling involves the sale of securities borrowed from the owner,
and generates profit when the trader repurchases them at a lower
price and returns them to the owner.  Short Sales  Hedge funds  and other large speculators hold a net 107,913
futures contracts wagering that the S&P 500 will decrease in
value. The short position is the highest since September 2007,
when bearish bets reached a record of 127,474 contracts a month
before the benchmark equity gauge reached an all-time high,
according to Bloomberg data going back to 1997.  Three stocks dropped for every two that rose in the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index. BNP Paribas SA and Banco Santander SA paced
losses in banks, which fell the most among 19 groups.  The chief executive officer of Deutsche Bank AG,  Josef
Ackermann , said yesterday market conditions remind him of late
2008, and urged lawmakers to act to avoid a repeat of the
financial crisis, which spawned the worst global recession since
the Great Depression.  The franc weakened at least 8 percent against every one of
its 16 major peers. The Swiss currency had climbed almost 13
percent this year versus the euro as the debt crisis in Europe’s
weakest economies prompted investors to seek the safest assets.  The Swiss Market Index of stocks jumped 4.4 percent, the
most since Aug. 12, on speculation the weaker currency will help
exporters. Swatch Group AG, the world’s biggest maker of
watches, rallied 4.3 percent. Transocean Ltd., the largest
offshore oil driller, soared 12 percent. Novartis AG, Europe’s
biggest drugmaker, surged 6.8 percent.  ‘Major’ Event  “The SNB move is a major foreign-exchange event for 2011
in a market running long the franc as a risk-aversion play,”
 Neil Jones , head of European hedge-fund sales at Mizuho
Corporate Bank Ltd. in  London , wrote in an e-mailed comment.  Greek bonds dropped, with 10-year yields climbing 50 basis
points to a euro-era record 19.82 percent, while two-year note
yields added 194 basis points to 52.31 percent. The yield spread

widened to a euro-era high of 1,797 basis points, or 17.97
percentage points.  Europe Meetings  Ministers from  Germany ,  Finland  and the Netherlands will
