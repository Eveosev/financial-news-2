The increase in pricing of corporate
credit risk is unjustified even by “lower growth expectations and
higher recession risks,” according to Morgan Stanley.  “Although a U.S. recession or Eurozone sovereign shocks
are risks, we think risk premiums are too elevated and unlike
‘normal’ cycles we have not seen a deterioration in balance
sheet quality,” analysts  Viktor Hjort , Kelvin Pang and Nishant
Sood wrote in a report today. “We are constructive on global
credit,” the analysts wrote.  The cost to protect U.S. company debt jumped today on
concern that the European debt crisis is worsening. The Markit
CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which investors use to
hedge against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, rose 9.6 basis points from Sept. 2 to a mid-
price of 129.6 as of 8:06 a.m. in New York, according
to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. That’s the biggest
increase since Aug. 8.  The credit swaps index, which typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves, has climbed
from 96.3 since the end of July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
