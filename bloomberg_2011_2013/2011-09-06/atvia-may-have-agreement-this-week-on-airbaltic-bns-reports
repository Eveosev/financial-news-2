The Latvian government may reach an
agreement this week with the minority shareholder of AirBaltic
AS to change the airline’s management, the  Baltic News Service 
reported, citing the Transport Minister.  The government met today with the minority shareholder,
Baltic Aviation System, and the airline’s lenders and may also
reach an agreement on a capital increase, said Transport
Minister Uldis Augulis, according to BNS.  The government said previously any additional capital for
AirBaltic would be contingent on changing the management after
the majority state-owned airline had a loss of about 34.2
million lati ($67.7 million) last year. The state owns 52.6
percent of AirBaltic while Baltic Aviation Systems has 47.2
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
