Bond insurer  MBIA Inc. (MBI) , which
guaranteed some of Wall Street’s toxic mortgage debt, agreed to
pay $68 million to resolve investor lawsuits alleging the
company misled shareholders about its exposure to mortgage-
backed securities.  The accord settles claims by lead plaintiff Teachers’
Retirement System of Oklahoma and shareholders who purchased
MBIA stock from July 2007 to January 2008, according to filings
in federal court in Manhattan today by lawyers for the company
and investors. The company denied wrongdoing, the filings said.  “Although we continue to believe our CDO exposure was
fully disclosed, we are pleased to have reached a settlement
that puts this matter behind us,” said  Kevin Brown , a spokesman
for Armonk, New York-based MBIA.  Investors alleged that MBIA made false and misleading
statements about the nature and extend of its exposure to
collaterialized debt obligations containing residential
mortgage-backed securities, including the company’s exposure to
CDOs made up of other CDOs containing the securities, the
filings said.  Steven Singer, an attorney for investors, said the accord
was a “very substantial recovery, in terms of the amount of
recoverable damages.” The settlement is subject to court
approval.  The case is In Re MBIA Inc. Securities Litigation, 08-264,
U.S. District Court,  Manhattan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
