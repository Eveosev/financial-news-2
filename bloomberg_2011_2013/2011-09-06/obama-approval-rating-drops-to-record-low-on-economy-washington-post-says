President  Barack Obama ’s approval
ratings fell to a record low as more than 60 percent of those
questioned said they don’t approve of the way he’s handling the
 U.S. economy , the Washington Post reported, citing a poll it
conducted with ABC.  The poll found that 43 percent approved of how he handles
his job overall while 53 percent didn’t, the newspaper said.  Only 28 percent of those questioned said they approved how
Republicans are handling their responsibilities in Congress
while 68 percent disapproved, the biggest gap since the summer
of 2008, the newspaper reported.  The telephone poll of 1,001 randomly selected adults was
conducted Aug. 29 to Sept. 1 and has a margin of error of plus
or minus 3.5 percentage points, Post said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
