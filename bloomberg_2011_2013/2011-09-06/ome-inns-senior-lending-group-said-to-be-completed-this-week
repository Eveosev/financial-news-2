The group of senior lenders on a
loan to help finance  Home Inns & Hotels Management Inc. (HMIN) ’s
purchase of  Motel 168 International Holdings Ltd . will be
completed this week, according to a person familiar with the
matter.  Four banks have already joined the facility, which is about
$250 million in size, as senior lenders, said the person, who
asked not to be identified as the details are private. Credit
Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co., which are also
financial advisers to the acquisition, are arranging the loan.  The phase in which banks are being invited to join as
senior lenders and underwriters will likely close this week and
the facility will be opened for general syndication in a few
weeks, the person said. The senior lenders are targeting total
commitments of $50 million to $60 million from banks in general
syndication, the person said.  Home Inns, which operates 934 hotels across 164 cities in
 China  according to its  website , agreed to buy budget hotel chain
operator Motel 168 in May for $470 million in cash, debt and
shares. The deal “will create the most geographically diverse
economy hotel operation in China,” Home Inns said in a May 27
 statement . Home Inns received antitrust approval on Sept. 2 for
the planned acquisition, which is expected to be completed by
the end of this month, another person familiar with the matter
said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
