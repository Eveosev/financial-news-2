Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  aims to increase
its European market share to 3 percent this year, the president
of the Korean automaker’s European operations said at a press
event today in Frankfurt.  The company aims to increase its share from the 2.8 percent
it had in the first half, by selling more than 400,000 vehicles
this year, according to Chang Kyun Han. The maker of the
Veloster coupe is targeting sales of 500,000 by 2013, Han added.  A market share of 5 percent in  Europe  “remains very far
from us,” Han said. “But we have to think more and more of
challenging those companies around eighth place in terms of
market share, who have around 5 percent of the market.”  Hyundai is adding a third shift at plants in Nosovice in
the  Czech Republic  and St Petersburg in Russia as it seeks to
lift its sales from 359,369 vehicles in Europe last year.  The European unit, based at Offenbach, Germany, was
previously too concerned about competing with Toyota, Marketing
Director Mark Hall said in an interview. “We should be
competing with Ford, Opel and these sort of brands,” he said.  Ford Motor Co. (F)  sold 1,295,925 vehicles in Europe in 2010,
while  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Opel sold 1,084,070, according to  the
European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association .  Hyundai will present a new generation of the i30 hatchback
at the Frankfurt motor show next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
