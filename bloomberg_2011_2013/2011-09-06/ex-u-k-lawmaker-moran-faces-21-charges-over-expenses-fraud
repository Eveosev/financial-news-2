Former U.K. lawmaker Margaret Moran
will face 21 charges over fraudulent expense claims totaling
more than 60,000 pounds ($96,500) while she was a member of
Parliament.  Moran is scheduled to appear in a London court later this
month to face the charges in U.K. prosecutors’ final case
against former lawmakers for filing fraudulent claims, Director
of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer said in an e-mailed
statement today.  “It is alleged that she claimed expenses for the
furnishing and improvement of main residences between November
2004 and August 2008 through a scheme intended for the
maintenance of second homes or offices,” Starmer said. Six of
the charges against Moran are for forgery related to falsified
invoices, he said.  The  Crown Prosecution Service  received files of evidence
for 10 people, and has brought charges against seven, including
Moran. No action was taken in two of the cases, and the police
withdrew one of the files, prosecutors said.  Calls by Bloomberg News to a mobile phone number and
landline that were previously used by Moran didn’t connect.  To contact the reporter on this story:
