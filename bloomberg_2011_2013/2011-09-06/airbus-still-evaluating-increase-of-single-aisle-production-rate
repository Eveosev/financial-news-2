Airbus SAS is still evaluating an
increased production rate of its single-aisle aircraft to keep
up with booming demand, said  Tom Williams , the head of programs
at the European manufacturer.  Airbus is mulling an increase to 44 A320 family aircraft a
month, Williams said at a conference in London today. While the
appetite for more aircraft exists, the Toulouse, France-based
company must consider the strain on the supply chain as well as
the lead time on materials such as titanium, Williams said.  The aircraft maker has increased production of its best-
selling airliner over the years. Airbus has final assembly lines
in Toulouse as well as Hamburg in northern Germany and in China.
The A320 competes with  Boeing Co. (BA) â€™s 737 narrow-body jet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
