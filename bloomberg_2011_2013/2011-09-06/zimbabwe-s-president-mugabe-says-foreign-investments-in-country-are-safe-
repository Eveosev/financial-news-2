Investments by foreign companies in
 Zimbabwe  are safe, President  Robert Mugabe  said, urging them to
comply with a law that compels foreign and white-owned companies
to sell 51 percent of their local assets to black citizens of
the country.  “I wish to assure investors that their investments in this
country remain safe,” he said at the opening of parliament in
Harare, the capital, today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
