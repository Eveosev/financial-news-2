Sinclair Oil Corp. has reduced
processing rates at its refinery near Rawlins,  Wyoming , as it
assesses damage and makes repairs after two fires within the
crude unit, Clint Ensign, a spokesman, said in an e-mail. The
assessment began Sept. 2 after the fires were extinguished, he
said.  The plant can process 85,000 barrels of crude a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
