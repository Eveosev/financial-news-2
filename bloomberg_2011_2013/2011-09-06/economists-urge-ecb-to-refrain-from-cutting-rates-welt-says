The European Central Bank should
refrain from cutting interest rates even as economies are
cooling,  Die Welt  reported, citing senior economists including
Andreas Rees at UniCredit Group and Allianz SEâ€™s Michael Heise.  ECB policy makers next convene on Sept. 8 to decide on
interest rates. The Frankfurt-based ECB has raised its benchmark
rate twice in 2011, taking it to 1.5 percent from 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
