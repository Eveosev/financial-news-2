Nigeria’s State Security Service
said it arrested six members of the Boko Haram group in
connection with two bombings that killed 15 people in Suleja,
about 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of the capital, Abuja.  Investigators found a bomb-making factory, Marilyn Ogar, a
spokeswoman for the service, said in an e-mailed statement
today. The suspects, including a citizen of neighboring Niger,
are also alleged to have killed four policemen May 22 in Bwari,
a suburb of the capital, and will soon be charged, she said.  “Investigation has indeed revealed that the suspects
belong to the Boko Haram cell operating in the Suleja-Abuja
axis, which is under the direction and control of a bloodthirsty
Boko Haram leader who is now at large,” Ogar said.  Nigerian authorities blame Boko Haram, a militant Islamic
group that draws inspiration from  Afghanistan ’s Taliban
movement, for a wave of bombings and killings since last year.
The group claimed responsibility for the Aug. 26 suicide car-
bomb attack on a United Nations building that killed 23 people
and wounded 71 in Abuja.  The bombing of Suleja’s electoral office took place on
April 8, the eve of parliamentary voting, while another attack
killed three people at a church in the city on July 10.  The bomb-making factory was discovered in Hayin-Uku village
in Niger state, Ogar said, and included detonators, gas
cylinders and pieces of shrapnel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
