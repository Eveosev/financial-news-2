The Canadian dollar traded within
one cent of parity with the greenback before tomorrow’s Bank of
 Canada  meeting as stocks fell and government bond yields slid to
record lows on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is worsening.  The currency, called the loonie, erased losses after an
index of  service industries  in the U.S., Canada’s biggest trade
partner, unexpectedly rose. The loonie fell in August on concern
a slowing global economy will crimp Canada’s exports. Futures
indicate odds are about even Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney 
will cut borrowing costs by year-end after data showed last week
the nation’s economy unexpectedly shrank in the second quarter.  “The market is taking a cautionary tone until we get data
from the Bank of Canada tomorrow,”  Steve Butler , managing
director of foreign-exchange trading at Bank of Nova Scotia’s
Scotia Capital, said by phone from Toronto. “The Canadian
dollar has hung in quite well, but at some point this week I
think we will probably drift back toward parity given that the
market right now doesn’t want to know about risk.”  The Canadian currency was little changed at 99.05 cents per
 U.S. dollar  at 5 p.m. in Toronto, compared with 99.07 cents
yesterday. Earlier it weakened as much as 0.6 percent to touch
99.66 cents, the weakest level since Aug. 11. One Canadian
dollar buys $1.0098. The currency last traded on a one-for-one
basis with the greenback Aug. 9.  The loonie rose against the euro and New Zealand’s dollar.  “We see a fair amount of corporate interest to buy Canada
at these levels,” said Butler.  Bond Yields Drop  The yield on 10-year Canadian government notes fell as much
as eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 2.22
percent, the lowest level in Bloomberg data beginning in 1989,
before trading at 2.24 percent. The price of the 3.25 percent
securities maturing in June 2021 rose 59 cents to C$108.83.
Yields on 30-year bonds touched 2.89 percent, the lowest since
at least 1990.  Yields on U.S. and German 10-year notes also dropped to
record lows as concern the euro area’s debt crisis will cripple
financial institutions underpinned demand for the safest assets.  The loonie fell against  Norway ’s krone, which rose against
all of its 16 most-traded peers as investors sought a European
alternative to the euro or franc. The Swiss currency, which
gained 19 percent against the greenback this year through
yesterday as risk appetite ebbed, tumbled after the nation’s
central bank imposed an exchange-rate ceiling.  ‘Negative Sentiment’  “There’s a lot of negative sentiment coming out of the
 euro zone , and people are looking for safety,” Rahim Madhavji,
president of Knightsbridge Foreign Exchange Inc., said in a
telephone interview from Toronto. “The risk-off trade is
back.”  The Canadian currency weakened 0.6 percent to 5.4615 krone.
It gained 0.7 percent to C$1.3866 per euro, strengthened 1.2
percent to 81.49 cents per  New Zealand  dollar and climbed 9.6
percent to C$1.1486 to the franc.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s index of U.S. non-
manufacturing businesses increased to 53.3 in August from 52.7 a
month earlier. A reading above 50 signals expansion. The median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey was for a decline to 51.  “Investors are trying to assess the extent of the decline
in the  U.S. economy  and see whether it’s going to be able to
muddle through,” Knightsbridge’s Madhavji said.  Stocks fell, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropping
as much as 2.9 percent before trading down 0.7 percent. Canada’s
benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index also declined 0.7 percent.  Futures on crude oil, Canada’s biggest export, dropped as
much as 3.8 percent to $83.20 a barrel in  New York  before
trading little changed at $86.46. Spot gold fell 0.1 percent to
$1,873.80 an ounce.  Raw materials  including oil and gold account
for about half of Canada’s export revenue.  Bank of Canada   The loonie has weakened 3.6 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, a gauge of 10
developed-nation currencies. The greenback has dropped 4.4
percent, while the yen has gained 0.3 percent.  All 27 economists in a Bloomberg News survey expect the
Bank of Canada to keep its policy rate at 1 percent tomorrow.  “The market has already guided expectations toward 50-50
on a rate cut by December,” said  Jack Spitz , managing director
of foreign exchange at  National Bank of Canada , by phone from
Toronto. “It will all be about the guidance, but with a
negative GDP and a deteriorating global backdrop, one would
expect Carney to take a dovish tone.”  The benchmark overnight rate has been 1 percent since
September 2010. It was increased in three steps last year from a
record low 0.25 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
