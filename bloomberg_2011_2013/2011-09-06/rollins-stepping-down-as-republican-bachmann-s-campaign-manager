Republican presidential candidate
 Michele Bachmann  lost two top campaign aides today as she
strives to remain in the top tier of the party’s field following
her victory last month at the Iowa straw poll.  Campaign manager Ed Rollins told  CNN  he was giving up day-
to-day management of Bachmann’s campaign, citing health and
fatigue. His deputy, David Polyansky, also was stepping down, he
said.  Rollins, 68, said he “hasn’t got the energy” for the grind
of running a presidential campaign. He said he would remain as
an advisor to the Minnesota congresswoman.  Bachmann has been running third among Republican
presidential contenders in recent public polls, behind Texas
Governor  Rick Perry  and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
