HSBC Holdings Plc cut its forecast
for global economic growth for the next two years and said the
efficacy of any further stimulus measures will be limited.  The world economy will grow 2.6 percent this year and 2.8
percent in 2012, compared with estimates published in June of 3
percent and 3.4 percent respectively, London-based HSBC
economists including Stephen King and Madhur Jha said in an e-
mailed note to clients today. HSBC also lowered its euro-area
and U.S. growth predictions, with the latter at “stall speed,”
the economists said.  “Healthy economic recovery is now but a distant dream,”
they wrote. “For the developed world, the downgrades are
particularly aggressive whereas, for the emerging world, the
reductions are more modest, helped by the ongoing support
offered by China and India.”  Central banks such as the Federal Reserve and the European
Central Bank may undertake further unconventional stimulus
measures, including interventions in currency markets, while the
Bank of England will keep its key interest rate on hold through
2012, King and Jha said.  “These, though, are no more than reactive measures,” they
said. “Permafrost has already taken hold: policy makers are now
engaged in not much more than damage limitation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
