Canadian spot natural gas fell as
cool weather in the U.S. Midwest and increased output from shale
formations pared the need for imports.  Cooling demand in the Midwest will trail normal by 25
percent through Sept. 9, according to Belton, Missouri-based
forecaster Weather Derivatives. Gas from shale formations in the
U.S. has displaced imports that used to come from  Canada , said
 Stephen Smith , an energy analyst.  “Summer-through-Labor Day imports have been well below
year-ago levels despite stronger summer heat,” said Smith,
president of Stephen Smith Energy Associates in Natchez,
 Mississippi . “Increased U.S. shale gas production and strong
Pacific hydropower generation have been contributing factors.”  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
fell 13.7 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $3.9781 per million Btu on
the  Intercontinental Exchange  as of 1:34 p.m. New York time.
Alliance is an express line that can carry about 1.5 billion
cubic feet a day to the Midwest from western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas was down 18.59 cents, or 4.7 percent, to $3.7436,
according to ICE. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded
for California markets, gas tumbled 19.18 cents, or 4.8 percent,
to $3.8069.  Alberta  gas for October delivery rose 1.5 cents to C$3.47
per gigajoule ($3.32 per million British thermal units) as of
4:30 p.m. New York time, according to  NGX,  a Canadian Internet
market. Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in Canada
and the U.S., and is priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta
system.  Nymex Gas  Gas for October delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose 6.6 cents, or 1.7 percent, to settle at $3.938 per
million Btu.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.9 billion cubic
feet, 95 million above target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.62 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 1.67 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 1.51 billion cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.25 billion cubic feet today, about 45
percent of its capacity of 2.76 billion.  The volume on Spectra Energy’s British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.82
billion cubic feet at 3:20 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
