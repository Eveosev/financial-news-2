Czech industrial-output growth was
the slowest in 19 months in July as manufacturing expansion
weakened.  Overall production increased an annual 4.4 percent, the
weakest reading since December 2009, compared with a revised 7.9
percent growth rate in June, the statistics office in  Prague 
said on its website today. The median forecast of 14 economists
in a Bloomberg survey was for a 5 percent advance in July.  Manufacturing-output growth slowed to 5.8 percent in July,
from 8.6 percent in the previous month and compared with 15.2
percent in May. Separate data showed construction output fell
11.1 percent in July, the worst result this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
