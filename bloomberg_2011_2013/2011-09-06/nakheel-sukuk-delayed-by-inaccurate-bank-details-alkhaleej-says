Nakheel PJSC, the developer of man-
made islands off Dubai’s coast, delayed the issuance of 1
billion dirhams ($272 million) of Islamic bonds to its
contractors and suppliers after bank account details of 30 trade
creditors were found to be inaccurate,  Alkhaleej  reported,
citing an unidentified person.  The company asked the creditors to resubmit their account
details to proceed with the second tranche of Islamic bonds, the
newspaper said. The program is part of Nakheel’s 4.8 billion-
dirham sukuk program.  -- Editor: James Kraus  To contact the reporter on this story:
