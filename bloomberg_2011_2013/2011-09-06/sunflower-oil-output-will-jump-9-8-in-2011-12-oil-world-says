Sunflower oil production will climb
9.8 percent on bigger crops in  Russia , Ukraine and the European
Union, Hamburg-based  Oil World  said.  Production will jump to 13.44 million metric tons in 2011-
12 from 12.24 million tons a year earlier, Oil World analysts
said in a report today. The season beginning in October is
expected to start with stockpiles at a three-year low of 1.1
million tons, down about 200,000 tons from 2010-11, it said.  “This will curb the anticipated growth of supplies,” the
company said, referring to the opening stocks and production.
“The backbone of the anticipated supply growth in 2011-12
is seen in record sunseed crops expected in Russia and Ukraine,
as well as sharply higher production in the EU-27.”  World exports of sunflower oil are expected to increase by
500,000 tons to 5.16 million tons, with a record 2.7 million to
2.8 million tons from  Ukraine , according to the report.  “Importers are taking advantage of improving price
competitiveness,” according to the report. Prices may be at a
discount of $30 to $50 a ton below soya oil, Oil World said.
That compares with a sunflower oil premium of around $100 during
the past 10 seasons.  Sunflower oil imports are expected to increase in North
Africa and the EU, where consumption in the bloc may reach a
record 3.5 million tons, Oil World said.  In  India , sunflower cultivation is declining and imports
may be 780,000 tons in 2011-12, making the South Asian country
the second largest destination behind the EU, according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
