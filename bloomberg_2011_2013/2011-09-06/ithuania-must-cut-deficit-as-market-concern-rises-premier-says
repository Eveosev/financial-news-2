Lithuania must stick to its goal of
reducing the  budget deficit  to within the European Union’s rules
next year to curb debt amid the financial-market turmoil, Prime
Minister Andrius Kubilius said.  Lithuania needs to cut the budget deficit to within the EU
rules to qualify for the planned euro adoption in 2014.
Kubilius’ government aims to narrow the budget deficit to 3
percent of GDP in 2012 from an estimated 5.3 percent this year.
The budget shortfall totaled 7.1 percent in 2010.  “The situation in the international markets is an
increasing concern,” Kubilius said in an interview with
 Lietuvos Radijas  today. “In this environment, the goal of
reducing the budget deficit to within 3 percent of gross
domestic product is gaining more importance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
