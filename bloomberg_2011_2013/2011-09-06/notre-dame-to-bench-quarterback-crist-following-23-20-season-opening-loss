University of Notre Dame  senior
quarterback Dayne Crist won’t start the team’s next game after
being benched in the second half of the Fighting Irish’s 23-20
loss to  South Florida  last weekend, coach Brian Kelly said
today.  Crist, 21, will be on the sidelines when unranked  Notre
Dame  travels to play the  University of Michigan  on Sept. 10,
Kelly said during a press conference. Crist, who was named the
starter on Aug. 23, was 7-of-15 for 95 yards and one
interception before being pulled against South Florida.  Sophomore Tommy Rees will start in Crist’s place, Kelly
said. Rees was 24-of-34 for 296 yards, two touchdowns and two
interceptions in the second half against the Bulls, when Notre
Dame scored all its points.  The Fighting Irish, who were ranked No. 16 in the
Associated Press poll before hosting South Florida, lost their
season-opening game for the first time since 2007, when the team
started 0-5. Notre Dame has won a record eight national titles
since the AP began naming a winner in 1936, according to the
team’s media guide.  Notre Dame and Michigan play in  Ann Arbor  at 8 p.m. on
Sept. 10. The Wolverines’ 885 wins are a Division-IA record. The
Fighting Irish rank third with 845, according to the school’s
athletic department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
