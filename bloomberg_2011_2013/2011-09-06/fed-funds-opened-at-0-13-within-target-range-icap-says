Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending rate, opened at 0.13 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.09 percent on Sept. 2 after trading
from 0.03 percent to 0.14 percent and averaging 0.09 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-
mailed statement. ICAP’s monthly average is 0.08 percent.  The central bank will acquire $500 million to $1 billion of
Treasuries maturing from March 2013 to February 2014. The
purchases are part of the Fed’s policy to continue to reinvest
the proceeds of maturing assets on its balance sheet to prevent
a tightening of monetary policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
