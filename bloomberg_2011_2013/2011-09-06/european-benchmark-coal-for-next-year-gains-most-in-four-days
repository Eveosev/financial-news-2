Benchmark European coal advanced the
most in four days.  Thermal coal for delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or
Antwerp with settlement next year rose 50 cents, or 0.4 percent,
to $129.25 a metric ton at 9:20 a.m. in  London , according to
broker prices compiled by Bloomberg. Thatâ€™s the biggest gain
since Aug. 31.  Bloomberg tracks data from information supplied by ICAP
