Iceland’s Civil Protection
Department has increased its monitoring of the North Atlantic
island’s largest volcano, Katla, following increased seismic
activity in the surrounding area, according to a statement on
its  Web Site .  “We can’t rule out that” an eruption is under way, Magnus Tumi Gudmundsson, a geologist at the Institute of Earth Science
with the  University of Iceland , told national broadcaster RUV.
“It’s possible that magma is gathering underneath the
mountain.”  Gudmundsson said it was too early to say exactly what was
happening at the volcano. Three earthquakes were measured in the
Katla area after 7 p.m. local time, according to  Iceland’s
Meteorological Office . The largest quake was about 2.0 on the
Richter scale, the  Met Office  said.  Katla had two small eruptions in 1955 and 1999, neither of
which managed to break the ice covering its 10 kilometer-wide (6
mile) caldera. The last major eruption in Katla began in 1918,
when ash explosions from the crater didn’t subside for more than
five weeks.  Ash from Iceland’s Grimsvotn volcano forced flight
cancelations in  Scotland , northern  England  and  Germany  in May.
An eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano in April last year
caused the cancellation of more than 100,000 flights on concern
glass-like particles formed from lava might melt in aircraft
engines and clog turbines. Historically, Eyjafjallajokull has
been known to erupt one to two years prior to Katla.  To contact the reporter on this story:
