Bearish bets by investors using
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures increased to the highest
level in almost four years amid concern global economic
growth is stalling.  Hedge funds  and other large speculators were net short
107,913 contracts in the week ended Aug. 30, wagering that the
S&P 500 will decrease in value, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The
position is the highest since September 2007, when bearish bets
reached a record 127,474 contracts a month before the benchmark
equity gauge peaked at an all-time high, Bloomberg data going
back to 1997 show.  “If they’re global macro funds, they may be doing this
because they think risk is to the downside in the S&P 500,”
Michael Purves, chief market strategist at BGC Partners LP in
 New York , said in a telephone interview. “The long/short hedge
funds may also be shorting futures simply to hedge out single
stock longs.”  The  S&P 500  fell 57 percent from its 1,565.15 record in
October 2007 to a 12-year low of 676.53 on March 9, 2009, during
the worst financial crisis since the 1930s. The index then more
than doubled to an almost three-year high on April 29, fueled by
government stimulus and better-than-estimated corporate
earnings, before sliding as much as 18 percent amid concern the
economy was weakening. The gauge lost 13 percent last month
before trimming its retreat to 5.7 percent after the  Federal
Reserve  said it will act to spur growth.  Short Selling  The proportion of S&P 500 shares outstanding sold short
rose to the highest level since the end of November last week,
climbing to 3.03 percent on Aug. 29 from 2.37 percent at the
beginning of August, according to New York-based Data Explorers,
which provides research on short sales and  stock lending . Short
selling of the gauge reached a three-year high of 5.52 percent
in August 2008.  The S&P 500 has declined 1.1 percent on average in
September since 1928. It’s one of three months in which stocks
have fallen, with the next-closest a 0.2 percent loss in
February. Since the  bull market  began in March 2009, September
has produced the biggest gains, averaging 6.2 percent.  Stocks in the S&P 500 are moving in tandem. The number of
companies rising or falling has reached 400 on 35 days this
year. If the current pace persists, the phenomenon will occur on
51 days in 2011, one short of the record 52 in 2008, according
to data compiled by Bespoke Investment Group LLC.  “Stocks are moving in lockstep and that makes broad hedges
such as betting against S&P 500 futures cleaner,”  Uri Landesman , managing general partner of Platinum Partners LLP,
said in e-mail. “For people who like to bet the S&P
directionally, volatility is what attracts them here,” said
Landesman, who helps manage $1 billion at the New York-based
hedge fund. “The more volatile the market is, the more juice
there is in the contracts if you trade them on a short-term
basis.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
