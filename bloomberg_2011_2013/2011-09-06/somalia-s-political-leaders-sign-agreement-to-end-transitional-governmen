Somali political leaders signed an
agreement to replace the country’s transitional government by
next August in the latest effort to end conflict in a nation
that has been wracked by civil war for two decades.  Under a so-called road-map, the leaders agreed to prepare a
new constitution, reform parliament and work to improve security
in Mogadishu, the capital, over the next 12 months.  “We will implement the roadmap in order to bring the Somali
people prosperity and security,” President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed said at the end of a three-day conference in Mogadishu.
The meeting included representatives of the Transitional Federal
Government, or TFG, lawmakers, officials from the semi-
autonomous northern state of Puntland, and the pro-government
Ahlu Sunna Wal Jama’a militia.  The TFG was established in Somalia in 2004, the 14th
attempt to create a functioning central administration since the
fall of Mohamed Siad Barre’s dictatorship in 1991. The Western-
backed government’s mandate, which had been scheduled to end
last month, was extended for 12 months in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
