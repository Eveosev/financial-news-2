Gagfah SA (GFJ)  is weighing delisting from
 Germany â€™s MDAX index for medium-sized companies,  Financial Times
Deutschland  reported, without citing a source for the
information.  The property company may exit the index because
fluctuations in its stock price are hampering efforts to
refinance loans, the newspaper said. Gagfah announced a plan
yesterday to buy back shares for 75 million euros ($105
million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
