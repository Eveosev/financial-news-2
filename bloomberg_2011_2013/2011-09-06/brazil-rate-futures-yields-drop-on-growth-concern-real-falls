Yields on Brazilian  interest-rate 
futures contracts fell for a second day as concern the global
economy is worsening spurred speculation the central bank will
continue to reduce interest rates.  Yields on the futures contract due in January 2013 fell
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 10.54 percent at
10:51 a.m. New York time.  Yields tumbled as concern the European debt crisis is
spreading increased speculation the global economy may slip back
into recession.  “The fall in rate futures in  Brazil  has to do with the
external scene,” said Alfredo Barbutti, an economist at
Liquidez DTVM Ltda in Sao Paulo. “The central bank’s room to
maneuver is principally determined by the external scenario,”
he said in a telephone interview.  The real declined 0.9 percent to 1.6602 per dollar, from
1.6452 yesterday. It earlier touched 1.6668, the weakest level
since March 21.  Brazilian inflation accelerated for the 12th straight month
in August to its highest annual level since 2005, reinforcing
economists’ views that the central bank may have cut borrowing
costs prematurely.  Consumer prices, as measured by the IPCA index, rose 0.37
percent in August from the previous month, the national
statistics agency said today. That was in line with analyst
expectations for a 0.36 percent increase, according to the
median estimate of 40 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Prices
rose 7.23 percent from a year ago, the highest since June 2005.  Policy makers led by central bank President Alexandre Tombini cut the benchmark interest rate to 12 percent on Aug.
31, after raising it at the previous five policy meetings in the
most abrupt turnaround in monetary policy since 1999. The bank
said a “moderate adjustment” in the key rate wouldn’t
compromise its 4.5 percent inflation target next year because of
a “substantial deterioration” in the global economy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
