Swiss stocks jumped, rebounding from
their largest two-day drop since March 2009, after the central
bank set a ceiling on the franc’s exchange rate for the first
time in more than three decades.  Swatch Group AG (UHR) , the world’s biggest maker of watches,
rallied 4.3 percent.  Transocean Ltd. (RIG) , the largest offshore oil
driller, soared 12 percent.  Novartis AG (NOVN) ,  Europe ’s biggest
drugmaker, surged 6.8 percent.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI) , a measure of the biggest and most
actively traded companies, rallied 4.4 percent to 5,367.24 at
the 5:30 p.m. close in Zurich. The gauge has still tumbled 20
percent from this year’s high on Feb. 18 amid speculation that
the franc’s strength will curb exports and the global economic
recovery will stall. The broader Swiss Performance Index rose 4
percent today.  The minimum franc exchange rate is “positive for exporters
with a domestic production like watchmakers, chemical makers and
the asset-management industries,” said Thomas Haerter, chief
strategist at Swisscanto Asset Management AG in Zurich, who
helps oversee about $67 billion.  The franc weakened as much as 9.9 percent against the euro
as the  Swiss National Bank  set a minimum exchange rate of 1.20
per euro and said it will defend the target with the “utmost
determination” if needed.  Swatch Soars  Swatch surged 4.3 percent to 346.30 francs, after earlier
gaining as much as 7.6 percent. Cie. Financiere Richemont SA,
which sells Cartier watches and Mont Blanc pens and gets more
than 95 percent of sales outside  Switzerland , rose 4.5 percent
to 43.87 francs.  Transocean soared 12 percent to 44.50 francs, its largest
advance since April 2010.  Novartis AG surged 6.8 percent to 47.47 francs, its biggest
gain in almost three years, as Morgan Stanley analyst Peter Verdult said the Swiss drugmaker will be “a winner” in the
market to produce lower-cost copies of biologic medicines made
from living cells, so-called biosimilar treatments.  Adecco SA (ADEN) , the world’s biggest supplier of temporary
workers, gained 2.6 percent to 32.98 francs.  Syngenta AG (SYNN)  added jumped 5.2 percent to 251 francs as
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. raised its recommendation to “market
perform” from “underperform.”  Lonza Group AG (LONN) , the world’s
biggest maker of drug ingredients, rose 2.9 percent to 49.31
francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
