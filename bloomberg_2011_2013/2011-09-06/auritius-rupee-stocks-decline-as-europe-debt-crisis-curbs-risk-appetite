Mauritius’s rupee headed for an
almost eight-week low against the dollar as the worsening debt
crisis in  Europe , its main trading partner, curbed demand for
riskier emerging- and frontier-market assets. Stocks declined.  The currency depreciated 0.9 percent to 28.30 per dollar,
the weakest intraday level since July 22, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The rupee slumped the most in more than
three months against the euro, losing 3.3 percent to 40.8854.
The 38-member SEMDEX index gauge of stocks retreated 0.9 percent
to 1,929.58 at the 1:30 p.m. close in Port Louis, the capital,
its biggest drop since Aug. 19, led by Mauritius Commercial
Bank, the country’s largest lender by market value.  Ministers from  Germany , Finland and the Netherlands will
meet today to discuss a Finnish demand for collateral in a
bailout for  Greece , while the Italian Senate will debate an
austerity plan amid a strike.  “Markets have been thrown into the deep end of bear-market
territory,” analysts at MCB wrote in an e-mailed note to
clients. “The potential consequences” of international lenders
withdrawing support for a Greek debt repayment “could plunge
the whole eurozone into a deep recession, even threatening the
survival of the euro.”  Europe is the largest buyer of the Indian Ocean island
nation’s manufactured goods, with a 65 percent share, the
 Central Statistics Office  said on Aug. 30. Tourists from Europe,
led by  France , account for almost two-thirds of arrivals in the
country, the Mauritius Tourism Promotion Authority said.  Buying prices for the dollar range ranged from 27.3424 to
27.5108 and the selling price rose to 28.8101 compared with
28.7277 yesterday, according to  indicative exchange rates 
published today on the Bank of Mauritius’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
