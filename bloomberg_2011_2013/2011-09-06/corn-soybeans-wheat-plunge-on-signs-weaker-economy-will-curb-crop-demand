Corn, soybean and wheat futures fell
on speculation that  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis will hinder
the global economy, reducing demand for food, livestock feed and
fuel made from crops.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials
dropped as much as 2.1 percent, and global equity markets fell.
 Josef Ackermann , the chief executive officer of Deutsche Bank
AG, said that market conditions remind him of late 2008, which
preceded the deepest global economic slump since the 1930s. The
U.S. is the world’s top exporter of corn, soybeans and wheat.  “Increasing European debt problems depressed commodity
demand,” Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness at Archer
Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview. “Fear and a lack of confidence in governments to
address their debt problems and revive economies are reducing
speculative buying.”  Corn futures for December delivery fell 4.25 cents, or 0.6
percent, to close at $7.5575 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade. The price has jumped 63 percent in the
past year after hot, dry weather in July and August hurt crops.  Soybean futures for November delivery dropped 23.25 cents,
or 1.6 percent, to $14.225 a bushel. The oilseed has gained 37
percent in the past year.  Wheat futures for December delivery fell 15.5 cents, or 2
percent, to $7.60 a bushel. The grain has advanced 2.5 percent
in the past year.  In the week ended Aug. 30,  hedge funds  and other large
speculators increased bullish bets on agricultural commodities
by the most in more than a year on signs of tightening supplies
amid adverse weather. Holdings in wheat more than tripled, corn
reached an 11-week high, and soybeans jumped to the highest
since November.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government figures
show. Wheat is the fourth-largest, behind hay, at $13 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
