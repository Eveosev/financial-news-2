Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan
may fire the countryâ€™s top security officials, including the
military service chiefs and head of the intelligence agency,
 Vanguard newspaper  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The proposed firings are motivated by the insecurity
created by bombings in Abuja, including the Aug. 26 attack on
the United Nations office in the capital that killed 23 people
and injured more than 70 others, the Lagos-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
