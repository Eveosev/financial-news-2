Arsenal defender  Thomas Vermaelen  is
expected to return to training in a month after undergoing
surgery on his left ankle yesterday, the London soccer club said
today.  Vermaelen had a “minor procedure” to remove an inflamed
plantaris tendon from his ankle, Arsenal said on its  website ,
denying U.K. media reports today the Belgian had his Achilles
tendon operated on.  The club said the surgery was done to prevent the injury
from becoming a persistent problem and was the same treatment he
had on his right ankle in January. Vermaelen missed almost all
of last season because of injury.  Arsenal, which has one point from its first three matches,
hosts Swansea in the Premier League on Sept. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
