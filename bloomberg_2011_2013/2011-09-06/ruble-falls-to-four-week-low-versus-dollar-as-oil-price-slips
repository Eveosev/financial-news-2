The ruble declined for a fourth day
against the dollar, heading for its lowest close in almost four
weeks, as oil traded down before a U.S. report that’s expected
to show a slowdown in  service industries .  Russia’s currency slipped 0.3 percent to 29.5675 per dollar
by 11:09 a.m. in Moscow, poised for its weakest closing level
since Aug. 10. It dropped 0.3 percent to 41.6800 per euro.  Oil traded down 3.3 percent in  New York  and Brent gave up
earlier gains in  London  before a report today that may show U.S.
service industries grew at the slowest pace in more than a year,
spurring concern the economic recovery is foundering. Energy
sales account for as much as 40 percent of Russian government
revenue and 17 percent of gross domestic product.  “A severe flight to quality effect is dominating the
market space,” VTB Capital analysts Nikolay Podguzov and Maxim
Korovin wrote in an e-mailed research note today. “The ruble is
likely to remain under pressure.”  The movements against the dollar and the euro left the
ruble 0.3 percent weaker at 35.0181 against the central bank’s
target currency basket, which is used to manage swings that hurt
Russian exporters. The basket is calculated by multiplying the
dollar’s rate to the ruble by 0.55, the euro to ruble rate by
0.45, then adding them together.  Non-deliverable forwards show the currency at 29.9055 per
dollar in three months. The contracts provide a guide to
expectations of currency movements and interest-rate
differentials and allow companies to hedge against currency
swings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
