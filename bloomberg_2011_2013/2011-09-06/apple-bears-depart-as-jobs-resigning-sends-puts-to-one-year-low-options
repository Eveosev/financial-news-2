Prices to insure  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  shares
from losses dropped to a one-year low after Steve Jobs, who
presided over a 91-fold increase in the stock, stepped down as
chief executive officer.  Instead of increasing equity swings, Apple shares are
almost unchanged since Aug. 24 when Jobs, who turned the company
into the world’s biggest by market value, said he resigned.
Implied volatility for three-month options at the current stock
price fell to 1.07 times the level of historic volatility, down
from this year’s peak of 1.9 in February. Options usually rise
when moves in the underlying security increase.  Reduced costs for puts, or bearish bets, show the prospect
of Apple without Jobs as CEO isn’t shaking options traders as
investors focus on earnings and as analysts project record
profits. Before, stockholders were concentrating on the health
of Jobs, who founded the company in 1976 and was diagnosed with
a rare form of cancer in 2003.  “Apple is a company-specific story right now,” Lawrence Creatura, a Rochester, New York-based fund manager at Federated
Investors Inc., which oversees about $350 billion, said in a
telephone interview. “Regardless of any wave of pessimism that
washes over the market, investors will look at Apple’s destiny
independently. Apple’s been a good story that’s only getting
better at this stage, despite Steve Jobs’s departure.”  Steve Dowling, a spokesman for the Cupertino, California-
based company, declined to comment.  Beating the Industry  Apple shares advanced 1 percent to $379.74 through
yesterday since Jobs quit, giving the company a market value of
$352.1 billion. Exxon Mobil Corp. was the second-largest
corporation at $345.9 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Apple rose 1.1 percent to $383.93 as of 4 p.m. in New York.  Shares of the maker of the iPod, iPhone and iPad gained 18
percent this year through yesterday, compared with a loss of 7.1
percent for technology companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index. Tim Cook, the company’s former chief operating officer
who had been running day-to-day operations, succeeded Jobs, who
became chairman.  The stock’s implied volatility has dropped 14 percent to
35.72 yesterday from this year’s peak of 41.71 on Aug. 8, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Sixty-day historical volatility has
risen to 33.36, the highest since July 30, 2010, the data show.  “The uncertainty hanging over the stock is removed,” Jack Ablin, who helps oversee $60 billion as chief investment officer
for Chicago-based Harris Private Bank, said in a telephone
interview. “The best that Apple can hope for is more of the
same.”  VIX Climbs  The benchmark index for U.S. stock options snapped a three-
day streak of gains. The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options
Exchange Volatility Index is known, dropped 9.8 percent to
33.38. The index measures the cost of using options as insurance
against declines in the S&P 500, which rose 2.9 percent.  No matter how cheap its options, Apple’s profit growth will
slow and the shares will fall should the U.S. enter a recession,
said Ryan Baird, an options trader and partner at Flotilla
Partners Inc., a San Francisco-based proprietary trading firm.  The stock lost 57 percent in 2008. The world’s largest
economy shrank 5.1 percent from the fourth quarter of 2007 to
the second quarter of 2009, the most during any recession since
the 1930s, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.  ‘To the Woodshed’  “If the consumer dies, Apple could definitely break
down,” Baird said in a telephone interview. “The bull case is
that it’s probably going to go down less than its competitors,
but if the market gets hit, Apple is going to get hit, too. In
the financial crisis, we saw it get taken to the woodshed.”  American employers added no jobs in August, the Labor
Department said last week, and the Conference Board’s consumer-
confidence gauge fell to the lowest level since April 2009. U.S.
gross domestic product will probably expand 1.8 percent in 2011,
according to the median forecast of 56 economists in a Bloomberg
survey. That’s down from an estimate of 3.1 percent in January.  Apple said iPhone sales rose 142 percent from a year
earlier to 20.3 million in the quarter ended June 25, while the
number of iPads sold climbed 183 percent to 9.25 million. The
company will account for 74 percent of tablet shipments this
year as they rise to 60 million units in 2011 from 17.4 million
in 2010, according to an Aug. 24 report from IHS Inc.’s iSuppli,
a research firm in El Segundo, California.  Beating Estimates  “Apple is not a company that’s going to come out and set a
bad forecast or guide lower,” Andrew Keene, an independent
trader at the Chicago Board Options Exchange, said in a
telephone interview. “They don’t have anything that can make
the stock gap down.”  Analysts project that the company will post 2011 profit of
$27.50 a share excluding some items, according to the average of
46 estimates in a Bloomberg survey. That would be the most since
at least 1999. It has topped the average income projection for
26 straight quarters, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Apple’s board ousted Jobs in 1985 amid differences over
strategy. He returned as interim CEO in 1997 to save the company
from bankruptcy, introducing the translucent iMac computer in
1998, the iPod digital music player in 2001, the iPhone in 2007
and the iPad tablet computer last year.  The iPhone has become Apple’s best-selling product. Buyers
snapped up almost 40 million last year, accounting for 38.6
percent of Apple’s $65.2 billion of sales in 2010.  HP Surrenders  Hewlett-Packard Co. surrendered in its bid to compete in
the tablet market against Apple. The world’s largest computer
company said Aug. 31 that would produce a final run of its
TouchPad. After announcing plans to stop making the device, HP
cut its price to $99 from $499, a fifth the cost of the cheapest
iPad. The final batch will be available in the fiscal fourth
quarter, which ends Oct. 31.  Option prices for Apple are inexpensive relative to other
technology companies. Three-month implied volatility for at-the-
money options fell to the lowest in more than a year on Aug. 31
relative to the  Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund. (XLK)   JPMorgan Chase & Co. recommended buying Apple’s December
$395 calls while selling December $345 puts and December $430
calls last week, a strategy that profits most if the shares
close above $430 at expiration. The New York-based firm, which
rates Apple an “overweight” with a 12-month price estimate of
$525, said Jobs’s resignation creates an “attractive” entry
point, according to a report.  “Apple always seems to be the one resilient company and
it’s because of their innovation,” said Brian Overby, an
options analyst at TradeKing Inc. in Charlotte, North Carolina.
“It’s always coming up with innovative new products. It’s a
neat and flashy company -- and people just like Apple.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
