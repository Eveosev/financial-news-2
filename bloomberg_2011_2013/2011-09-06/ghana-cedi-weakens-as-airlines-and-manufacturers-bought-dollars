Ghana ’s cedi weakened for the third
straight day as airlines bought dollars to send earnings outside
the country and manufacturers sought the U.S. currency to pay
suppliers abroad.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
depreciated to 1.5345 per dollar as of 3:56 p.m. in Accra, the
capital, from a closing of 1.5335 per dollar yesterday,
according to data compiled by Standard Chartered Bank Ghana Ltd.  “The cedi weakened amid build up of demand pressures from
the past two weeks,” Othniel Kwainoe, a currency trader at the
lender said in a telephone interview. “Today, demand for the
U.S. currency came from the airlines as well as the
manufacturing industry.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
