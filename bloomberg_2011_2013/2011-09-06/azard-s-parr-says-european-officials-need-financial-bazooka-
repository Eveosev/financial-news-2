Gary Parr, vice chairman of  Lazard
Ltd. (LAZ) , said financial-services companies are $500 billion short
of capital and some European banks require “meaningful capital
injections.”  “A number of banks would be out of business” if they
marked their assets to market prices, Parr said today in an
“Inside Track” interview on Bloomberg Television. “That still
suggests to me, yes, there are a number of banks that need
meaningful capital injections and capital infusions.”  The 440-billion euro ($618 billion) European Financial
Stability Facility bailout fund may need to be doubled, Parr
said. European officials such as European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet and International Monetary Fund Managing
Director Christine Lagarde are right in pushing for a stronger
ECB and a larger bailout fund, giving them power similar to
former U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson’s Troubled Asset
Relief Program, he said.  “A good thought was Paulson saying, ‘I need a bazooka,
give me a big solution,’ and that’s when he pushed TARP,” said
Parr, whose firm, the biggest non-bank merger adviser, is based
in Hamilton, Bermuda. “He wanted it to be so big that the
markets couldn’t test it. They wouldn’t test where is the
vulnerability. I think that’s what’s happening in Europe.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
