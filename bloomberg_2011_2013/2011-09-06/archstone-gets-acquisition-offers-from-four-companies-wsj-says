Archstone has received acquisition
offers from four suitors as its owners debate how to unwind the
apartment company, the Wall Street Journal reported.  Blackstone Group LP (BX) ,  Brookfield Asset Management Inc. (BAM/A) ,
 Equity Residential (EQR)  and  AvalonBay Communities Inc. (AVB)  have offered
to buy all or parts of Archstone, the Journal reported, citing
people familiar with the situation. The bids weren’t high enough
to resolve disagreements among Archstone’s owners --  Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) ,  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and  Barclays Plc (BARC) 
-- on the future of the company, the Journal said.  The owners are considering a sale of Archstone or an
initial public offering, the Journal reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
