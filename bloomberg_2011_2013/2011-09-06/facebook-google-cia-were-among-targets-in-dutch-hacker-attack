Dutch authorities began
investigating DigiNotar BV after hackers attacked the Internet-
safety company, targeting websites such as Facebook Inc. and the
U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.  Opta, the Dutch data protection agency, has started an 
investigation into the reliability of DigiNotar’s safety
certificates, Harriet Garvelink, a spokeswoman for the
government agency, said by phone. Public prosecutors will
separately start a probe, spokesman Ernst Koelman said.
DigiNotar is a unit of  Oakbrook Terrace , Illinois-based  VASCO
Data Security International Inc. (VDSI)   Web-security company Fox-It, which was hired by the 
government to investigate the breaches, determined that hackers 
issued fraudulent safety certificates via DigiNotar for 
websites run by companies including  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , Google 
Inc. and Facebook as well as the CIA, according to research 
posted on the Dutch  government’s website  yesterday.  DigiNotar  provides safety certificates for state and
commercial websites in the Netherlands. The Dutch government
said Sept. 3 that it no longer trusts certificates issued by
DigiNotar. “A part of Dutch Internet traffic is no longer
safe,” the government said.  Iran Link  DigiNotar found evidence on July 28 that rogue 
certificates were verified by Internet addresses from  Iran , 
according to the Fox-It report. "Current analyses still show
hacking attempts on the webserver originating from Iran," it 
said.  ”This really is an international issue,” Internal Affairs
Minister Piet Hein Donner said in a parliamentary debate in The
Hague today. “Faith in digital communication traffic has been
harmed.”  DigiNotar said in a  statement  on its website that it’s
cooperating with the Dutch government in the replacement of
certificates by other parties. A DigiNotar representative
couldn’t be reached for comment today.  A hacker, known as the ComodoHacker after he attacked
Comodo Group Inc in March, said he was behind the attack against
DigiNotar, security firm F-Secure Oyj said. On pastebin.com, a
website where users can store text online for a set period,
ComodoHacker said he still has access to four other certificate
providers, according to  F-Secure .  Royal KPN NV, the biggest Dutch phone company, said today
orders for its website-safety certificates have increased. KPN
has not identified potential attacks at its ”trusted services”
unit, spokeswoman Renee Schnitzler said.  “We are making maximum use of our capacity,” she said by
telephone. Among the parties placing orders is the Dutch
government, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
