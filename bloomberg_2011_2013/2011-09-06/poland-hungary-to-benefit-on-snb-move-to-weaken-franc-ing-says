Poland and  Hungary , where most home
loans are denominated in franc, will benefit from the
“excellent news” of the Swiss central bank’s decision to set a
minimum franc exchange rate versus the euro, ING Groep NV said.  The Swiss National Bank’s decision will “soon” help the
zloty strengthen to 4.15 per euro while the Hungarian forint may
advance to 271 versus the European common currency “in the near
term,”  Mateusz Szczurek , chief economist for central and
eastern Europe in Warsaw, wrote in an e-mailed note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
