Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told two lawmakers in mid-July that U.S. financial
companies’ exposure to  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis is
“manageable.”  Analyses by Fed banking supervisors suggest that “in
general, institutions’ direct net exposures to Greece, Ireland
and Portugal, including to the banks domiciled there, are
manageable relative to their capital,” Bernanke said in
identical letters to the Republican senators, Tom Coburn of
Oklahoma and Bob Corker of Tennessee. The comments, dated July
14, were obtained today by Bloomberg News in  Washington .  The senators wrote to Bernanke on June 16, citing a report
by the Bank for International Settlements showing almost $200
billion in exposure at U.S. financial firms to the debt of
Greece, Ireland and  Portugal . Since Bernanke’s response, the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has tumbled more than 10 percent in
part on investor concern that Europe’s debt crisis will worsen.  Bernanke warned in the letters that the crisis “could
affect a broad range of markets and financial institutions,
including potentially those outside of peripheral Europe.”  Coburn and Corker had asked the Fed chief to provide
information on how U.S. financial institutions would be affected
if one or more European countries in Europe defaulted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
