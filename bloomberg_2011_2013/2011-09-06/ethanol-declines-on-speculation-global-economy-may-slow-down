Ethanol futures declined in  Chicago 
on speculation the European debt crisis is spreading and will
sap global fuel demand.  Futures fell after European stocks dropped to the lowest
level since July 2009. Ethanol, made from corn in the U.S., is
blended with gasoline to stretch supply and reduce imports of
foreign  crude oil .  “Corn and crude oil,” said  Terry Reilly , an analyst at
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in Chicago. “There really isn’t
much going on in that market. Corn remains a little bit
underpinned. Outside markets kind of pressured it.”  Denatured ethanol for September delivery slid 5.2 cents, or
1.8 percent, to $2.84 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the lowest price since Aug. 19. Futures are up 19 percent this
year.  In cash market trading ethanol on the West Coast slid 8.5
cents, or 2.8 percent, to $2.935 a gallon and in  New York  the
biofuel sank 6 cents, or 2 percent, to $2.935, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the  Gulf Coast  decreased 3 cents, or 1 percent,
to $2.945 a gallon and in Chicago the additive dropped 4.25
cents, or 1.5 percent, to $2.825.  The profit from turning a bushel of corn into 2.75 gallons
of ethanol, or the so-called crush margin, was 12 cents today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
