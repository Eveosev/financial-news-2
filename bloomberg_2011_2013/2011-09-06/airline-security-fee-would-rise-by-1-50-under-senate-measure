The U.S. airline passenger security
fee would rise by $1.50 to $4 for each segment of a flight under
a homeland security appropriations measure outlined by
Democratic Senator  Mary Landrieu  of  Louisiana .  President  Barack Obama  proposed such an increase in his
budget in February. The current fee is $2.50 for each flight
segment, with a maximum of $5 for a one-way trip. The proposed
fee would be $4 per flight segment with a maximum of $8 for a
one-way trip. The increased revenue would be used for additional
security.  To contact the reporter on this story:
