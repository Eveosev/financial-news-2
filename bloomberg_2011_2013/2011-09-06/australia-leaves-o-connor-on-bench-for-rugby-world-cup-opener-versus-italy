Australia named an unchanged team
for its Sept. 11 Rugby World Cup opener against Italy in
Auckland, naming  James O’Connor  on the bench following the
winger’s return from suspension.  Selectors retained the starting 15 from the Tri-Nations
title-clinching victory over New Zealand on Aug. 27. O’Connor
sat out that match after he was suspended for missing the
Wallabies’ World Cup squad announcement.  On the replacements’ bench, O’Connor, hooker Tatafu Polota-
Nau and prop James Slipper replace Rob Horne, Saia Fainga’a and
Salesi Ma’afu, respectively.  Slipper and Polota-Nau were named in Australia’s 22-man
Test squad for the first time this year after missing the five
previous matches because of injuries.  AUSTRALIA: Kurtley Beale, Adam Ashley-Cooper, Anthony
Faingaa, Pat McCabe, Digby Ioane, Quade Cooper, Will Genia,
Radike Samo, David Pocock, Rocky Elsom,  James Horwill  (captain),
Dan Vickerman, Ben Alexander, Stephen Moore, Sekope Kepu.  Replacements: Tatafu Polota-Nau, James Slipper,  Rob
Simmons , Ben McCalman, Scott Higginbotham, Luke Burgess, James
