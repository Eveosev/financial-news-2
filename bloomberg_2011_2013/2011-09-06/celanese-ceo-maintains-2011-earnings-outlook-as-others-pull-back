Celanese Corp. (CE) , the largest producer
of acetyl chemicals used in paint and plastics, is maintaining
its forecast for increased earnings amid rising demand, while
other companies pull back.  Earnings will rise to at least $4.57 a share this year from
$3.37 a year earlier because global demand continues to grow for
the company’s chemical intermediates and automotive plastics,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer David Weidman said in a
telephone interview today. That matches the forecast that
Dallas-based Celanese issued on July 21.  “We see and hear an awful lot of companies that are
pulling back on their outlook or changing their views,” Weidman
said. “For us, that is not the case.”  The company continues to be as optimistic for this quarter
and the rest of the year as it was in July, he said. Celanese is
expected to earn $4.62 a share this year, the average of 11
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Clariant AG (CLN) , a Swiss chemical maker, cut its profit margin
and revenue forecasts for 2011 yesterday because of a slowdown
in demand and gains in the Swiss franc. Celanese factories that
make acetic acid continue to run at full rates and there is no
sign that customers are building unusually large inventories
across end markets, Weidman said.  “We have visibility out 30 to 45 days and we still see
good year-over-year gains,” Weidman said.  Increasing Confidence  Celanese fell $2.30, or 5.2 percent, to $41.67 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, after falling as
much as 8.4 percent to $40.28.  Confidence has increased since July in the company’s 2013
goal of earning at least $6 per share and $1.7 billion in
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
Weidman said. That’s because of rising sales of automotive
plastics and improved prospects for coal-derived ethanol, which
will be produced in  China  starting in 2013, he said.  The company is estimated to earn $5.71 a share in 2013,
according to the average of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
