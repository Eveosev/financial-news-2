Thailand ’s Cabinet approved the
government’s four-year spending plan, the National Economic and
Social Development Board Secretary-General Arkhom
Termpittayapaisith said.  The government may spend 11.5 trillion baht ($384 billion)
over the next four years to support policies to boost economic
growth, according to a draft document of the plan.  State agencies will complete details of the spending and
funding plan within 60 days of its publication in the Royal
Gazette, said Thitima Chaisang, a government spokeswoman. The
finance ministry and budget bureau must find appropriate sources
of funding “while considering the limitations on the budget and
maintaining fiscal discipline,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
