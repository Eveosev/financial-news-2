BAE Systems Plc,  Europe ’s largest
defense company, said it has developed an “invisibility cloak”
that can camouflage a tank or warship by using panels showing
images of its surroundings.  The technology uses on-board cameras and sheets of
hexagonal “pixels” which pick-up and display background
scenery in infra-red, London-based BAE said in an e-mailed
statement. BAE carried out tests on its CV90 light tank in July.  “We can resize the pixels to achieve stealth for different
ranges,” project manager Peder Sjoelund said in the statement.
A warship or building could be fitted with larger panels, he
added. The panels can also be reinforced to provide armor
protection.  The technology will be displayed in infra-red mode during
the U.K. Defence and Security Equipment International exhibition
in  London  next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
