The U.S. Treasury Department 
approved $4.3 billion for 382 financial institutions as part of
its Small Business Lending Fund.  The Treasury has completed more than $1.8 billion in
funding for 130 lenders, according to a department white paper
obtained by Bloomberg News today. Of 932 applications received,
more than 40 percent “failed to meet minimum statutory or
program requirements and therefore could not be approved,” the
Treasury paper said. Those requirements include size of the bank
and whether it had missed dividend payments.  The small-business lending program was set up in September
2010 by Congress and the administration of President  Barack Obama  to provide low-interest capital injections to community
banks that increase their lending to small businesses. The
program permits them to use the new capital to refinance their
Troubled Asset Relief Program debt.  The Obama administration has supported 17 tax breaks
providing tax relief of more than $50 billion for small
businesses, Don Graves, the Treasury’s assistant secretary for
small business, wrote in a blog posting Sept. 2. Small
businesses employ about half the workforce and account for 60
percent of gross  job creation , Graves said.  Because banks leverage their capital, funding provided
through the SBLF “will help increase lending to small
businesses in an amount that is multiples of the total amount
provided through these programs,” he wrote.  To contact the reporters on this story:
