The European Union will rule that
 Hungary ’s capital injections into the unprofitable state-owned
airline Malev Zrt. constitute “illegal state aid,”  Napi
Gazdasag  reported, without saying where it got the information.  The ruling may force Malev to pay back state funds “on the
order of 100 billion forint,” or $500 million, “which the
airline is unable to do in its current position,” the business
daily newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
