PepsiCo Inc., the world’s largest
snack-food maker, agreed on a 10-year extension of its
sponsorship accord with the  National Football League , the
company said.  The agreement is worth $2.3 billion, the Wall Street
Journal reported, citing an unidentified person with knowledge
of the contract’s details.  The deal will continue through the 2022 playoffs, the
company said in a statement. It ensures PepsiCo brands including
Gatorade, Pepsi, Frito-Lay, Tropicana and Quaker Oats remain
official marketing partners of the league at a cost of almost
$100 million a year, the newspaper said.  The NFL, with projected revenue of $9.3 billion in 2011, is
the U.S.’s richest and most popular sports league. The  Super
Bowl , the sport’s championship game, drew 11 million viewers in
February, making it the most-watched program in U.S. history.  To contact the reporter on this story:
