Iran  will start exporting  jet fuel 
to neighboring states and Eastern Asian countries within days,
the state-run  Press TV  news channel said, citing Jalil Salari,
the managing director of the National Iranian Oil Refining and
Distribution Co.  The fuel will be transported via a pipeline, Salari said,
without providing details of the route or naming the countries
to which Iran will be exporting, according to a report published
late yesterday on the channelâ€™s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
