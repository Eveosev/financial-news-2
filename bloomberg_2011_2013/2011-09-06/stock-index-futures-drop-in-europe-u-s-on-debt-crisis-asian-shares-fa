European stocks declined for a third
day, reaching the lowest in more than two years, as deepening
concern that the region’s debt crisis will derail the recovery
overshadowed better-than-estimated growth in U.S. services.  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  and Societe Generale SA fell more than 4
percent as a gauge of banks slid to the lowest level since March
2009.  Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo (CAM) , the Spanish savings bank
taken over by the Bank of Spain, slumped 8.4 percent after
posting a loss.  Bayer AG (BAYN)  plunged 7.5 percent after U.S.
regulators asked for more data on the blood thinner Xarelto.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slid 0.7 percent to 221.98 at
the 4:30 p.m. close in London after earlier climbing as much as
1 percent. The gauge has tumbled 7.1 percent over the past three
days, falling to the lowest close since July 2009.  “There’s still significant uncertainty regarding what will
happen with the European debt problem,” said Pierre Mouton, a
fund manager at Notz Stucki & Cie. in Geneva, who helps oversee
$7.5 billion. “The market remains afraid. The debt crisis and
worries about the economy are weighing on the market.”  National benchmarks indexes fell in 14 of the 18 western
European markets. Germany’s DAX Index slid 1 percent and
France’s CAC 40 lost 1.1 percent, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100
climbed 1.1 percent. The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  surged 4.4 percent
after the central bank set a ceiling on the franc’s exchange
rate for the first time in more than three decades.  Jobs Data  The Stoxx 600 plunged 2.4 percent on Sept. 2 after a worse-
than-forecast U.S. jobs report added to concern that America’s
economic recovery is stalling. The gauge lost 10 percent last
month amid concern that global economic growth is slowing as
Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis spreads.  Factory orders in Germany, Europe’s largest economy, fell
more than economists forecast in July, led by a drop in export
demand as the global economy cooled, a report today showed.  The Institute for Supply Management’s index of U.S. non-
manufacturing businesses increased to 53.3 in August from 52.7 a
month earlier. The measure was projected to drop to 51,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. A
reading above 50 signals expansion.  HSBC Holdings Plc cut its forecast today for global
economic growth for the next two years and said the efficacy of
any further stimulus measures will be limited. The world economy
will grow 2.6 percent this year and 2.8 percent in 2012,
compared with estimates published in June of 3 percent and 3.4
percent respectively, London-based economists including Stephen King and Madhur Jha said.  Goldman Forecast  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reduced its three-month forecast
for the Stoxx 600 by 6 percent to 210, citing weaker economic
data and political uncertainty. That’s 5.4 percent below today’s
closing level.  UniCredit, Italy’s largest lender, slid 4.5 percent to 79.5
euro cents. France’s  Societe Generale (GLE)  lost 6.5 percent to 18.93
euros, the lowest since March 2009.  EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA (EUROB) 
sank 9.4 percent to 1.16 euros, leading Greek banks lower. A
gauge of bank shares on the Stoxx 600 has fallen 12 percent in
the past three days.  Caja de Ahorros slumped 8.4 percent to 1.74 euros after
posting a 1.14 billion-euro ($1.6 billion) first-half loss,
highlighting the deterioration of a lender the government wants
to sell.  Bayer AG plunged 7.5 percent to 37.75 euros, the lowest in
two years, after U.S. regulators said more data is needed to
satisfy concerns the blood thinner Xarelto will prevent stroke
in people with the most common abnormal heart rhythm.  Infineon, Sandvik  Infineon Technologies AG (IFX) , Europe’s second-biggest
chipmaker, slipped 2.3 percent to 5.15 euros as Fairchild
Semiconductor International Inc. lowered its third-quarter
revenue forecast.  Sandvik AB (SAND) , the world’s biggest maker of metal-cutting
tools, fell 2.5 percent to 77.55 kronor. The stock was cut to
“underweight” from “equal weight” at Morgan Stanley.  Swatch Group AG (UHR)  led a rally in Swiss equities as the
central bank’s ceiling on the franc’s exchange rate eased
concern that the currency’s strength will hurt the earnings of
exporters. The world’s biggest maker of watches rose 4.3 percent
to 346.3 francs as the Swiss currency fell as much as 8.7
percent against the euro.  Transocean Ltd. (RIG) , the largest offshore
oil driller, soared 12 percent to 44.5 francs.  Whitbread Plc (WTB)  climbed 7.3 percent to 1,563 pence as the
U.K.’s largest hotel and restaurant operator said sales growth
accelerated.  To contact the reporters on this story:
