An Athens appeals court today
acquitted Greek sprinters Konstantinos Kenteris and Ekaterina Thanou and coach Christos Tzekos of staging a motorcycle
accident that led to the athletes missing a drug test before the
cityâ€™s 2004 Summer Olympic Games, the Athens News Agency said.  The court upheld a guilty charge against Tzekos for
possessing and storing illegal substances while it reduced a
previous near three-year sentence to 12 months, suspended for
three years, the Athens-based state-run news agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
