Mali’s government opened a new site
that will house ministries in the capital, Bamako, after
constructing the offices with a $93 million loan from  Libya ,
said Transportation and Equipment Minister Hamed Diane Semega.  The building, which has 1,200 offices, will house all the
West African nation’s government ministries, he said in an
interview yesterday. The loan, which covered 95 percent of
costs, will be repaid over 20 years, Semega said. Mali’s
administration paid for the remainder, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
