The euro may weaken to the lowest
level in seven months against the dollar as investors seek
refuge in German  government bonds , driving yields down,
according to Citigroup Inc.  The difference between the average yield of two-, five- and
10-year German bond yields and the comparable figure for  U.S.
debt  has dropped 17 basis points, or 0.17 percentage point, to
0.07 percentage point since the beginning of August, the lowest
level since February, according to a client note by  Tom Fitzpatrick , chief technical analyst at Citigroup in New York,
and Shyam Devani, a technical strategist in  London .  While Europe’s 17-nation currency has weakened 1.8 percent
against the dollar during the same period, the pace of its
decline has lagged behind that of the drop in bond spreads,
Fitzpatrick said in a telephone interview.  “The interest-rate chart has continued to tell you that
over time the dynamics between  Europe  and the U.S. consistently
look like they are worsening in the U.S.’s favor,” Fitzpatrick
said. “The concerns about Europe may eventually find themselves
more closely reflected in the currency, and that’s what we’re
thinking is beginning to happen.”  The euro dropped 0.8 percent to $1.3981 at 1:02 p.m. in New
York, from $1.4098 yesterday. German 10-year note yields fell to
a record 1.82 percent, while U.S. 10-year yields reached a
record low 1.91 percent.  The shared currency ended last week at $1.4205, below the
$1.4327 level that marked a bearish reversal, Fitzpatrick said.
A close below $1.4055 on a daily basis may add to the pressure
on the euro and push it down to $1.35, a level not seen since
February, he said.  Slowing Growth  The government bond yields have dropped as slowing economic
growth and concern that Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis is
worsening have caused investor risk appetite to shrink.  European economic data is underperforming by the most since
March 2009, according to Citigroup’s Eurozone Economic Surprise
Index. While data has also underperformed in the U.S., it has
been improving since hitting a 2 1/2-year low in June, according
to the firm’s U.S. Economic Surprise Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
