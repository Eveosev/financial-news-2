Republican presidential candidate
 Mitt Romney  today proposed cutting corporate and individual
taxes, turning the focus of the Republican presidential campaign
back to economic issues just hours before a potentially crucial
televised debate.  “My plan will create jobs,” Romney told a campaign rally
in Chandler, Arizona.  Romney’s proposal would set a permanent top  tax rate  of 28
percent, cut corporate taxes to 25 percent from 35 percent,
eliminate the estate tax and scrap the alternative minimum tax.  To pay for the cuts and reduce the federal  budget deficit ,
Romney said he’d trim $500 billion in spending by 2016.  Romney’s announcement came as President Barack Obama is
proposing a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 28 percent.
Obama’s plan would remove tax breaks for companies to help
offset lost revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
