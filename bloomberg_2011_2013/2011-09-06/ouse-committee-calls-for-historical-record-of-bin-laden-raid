The House Intelligence Committee is
seeking to require the Central Intelligence Agency compile a
classified history of the commando raid that killed  Osama bin Laden .  The committee, in its fiscal 2012  report , mandates that the
CIA “in consultation with other agencies” submit a classified
report that “memorializes” the Navy SEAL operation in  Pakistan 
in May.  The history should include a description of events leading
to discovery of bin Laden’s hideout, “planning and execution of
the raid and the results of the intelligence gained from the
raid,” the committee said in its report accompanying the fiscal
2012 intelligence budget.  The committee report also directs the CIA to preserve all
records connected with the case.  The Senate Intelligence Committee, in its fiscal 2012
legislation, doesn’t have the same provision, so the issue must
be resolved during negotiations between the committees on the
final intelligence budget.  The “real work” leading up to the raid took years, the
House committee’s chairman, Representative Mike Rogers, said
today in a Bloomberg News interview.  “We believe as a committee it was important to document
all that went into” the raid, including the contributions of
unknown analysts to the Navy SEALs who attacked, said Rogers, a
Michigan Republican.  “It’s easy to pick out the ‘winners’ of this without
having the history to tell us the whole story,” he said.  “I thought it was important, not just for the ‘chest
thumping,’ that’s the least of the reasons, for us to completely
understand everything that went into it and how difficult it was
and where we can improve,” Rogers said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
