Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average
rose the most in five months after the nation’s currency fell to
a four-week low versus the dollar and the government pledged to
ask Group of Seven officials to support a weaker yen.  Honda Motor Co., a carmaker that gets 83 percent of its
sales abroad, rose 1.6 percent. Shippers gained after Credit
Suisse Group AG started coverage of the maritime traffic sector
with an “overweight” rating.  Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914)  rose 3.5
percent after the world’s fourth-biggest cigarette maker asked
the government to sell its shares in the company and use the
funds to pay for disaster relief efforts.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 2 percent to 8,763.41 as
of the 3 p.m. trading close in  Tokyo , gaining the most since
March 30. It ended at 8,590.57 yesterday, its lowest close since
April 28, 2009. The broader Topix index gained 1.7 percent to
753.63, the biggest advance since May 31.  Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  “is very cautious about a
strong yen and has introduced measures to halt its advance,”
said  Yoshinori Nagano , a senior strategist in Tokyo at Daiwa
Asset Management Co., which oversees about $104 billion.
“Stocks are mainly rebounding from yesterday’s losses.”  Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi yesterday said he will
appeal to his Group of Seven counterparts about the danger a
strong yen poses to the economy when he meets them for the first
time in Marseille,  France , on Sept. 9-10. Azumi became Japan’s
finance chief last week, succeeding Noda.  ‘Excessive Gains’  The yen touched 77.73 per dollar yesterday, the weakest
since Aug. 9, before trading at 77.27 today. A weaker yen boosts
the value of overseas income at Japanese companies when
converted into their home currency.  Stocks extended gains even after the yen pared yesterday’s
losses and the  Bank of Japan  today kept its key  interest rate 
between zero and 0.1 percent and left the amount of its lending
and asset-purchase programs unchanged.  Exporters advanced, with Honda gaining 1.6 percent to 2,376
yen.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s biggest camera maker, climbed 1.5
percent to 3,500 yen.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.7 percent
today. In  New York , the index fell 0.7 percent yesterday amid
concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is worsening.  Topix’s Performance  The Topix Index fell 1.9 percent to 741.20 yesterday, the
lowest close since March 13, 2009, amid concern U.S. economic
growth is sputtering and Europe’s crisis will damage the banking
system, damping demand in two of Japan’s biggest export markets.
The index has lost 16 percent this year, cutting the price of
shares on the gauge to 0.88 times book value, the lowest since
March 2009.  The 14-day relative strength index for the Topix fell to 33
yesterday, close to the 30 threshold that some traders see as a
sign the index is poised to reverse course.  “Price-to-book ratio shows stocks are cheap, and technical
indicators are also showing equities are approaching a buy
zone,” said Hiroichi Nishi, an equities manager in Tokyo at
SMBC Nikko Securities Inc.  Shipping companies gained after Credit Suisse started
coverage of the maritime traffic sector at “overweight,”
citing cost-cutting efforts to improve earnings.  Nippon Yusen K.K., Japan’s biggest shipping line by sales,
jumped 2.3 percent to 223 yen.  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd., ranked
No. 2, gained 4 percent to 316 yen.  Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. (9107) ,
No. 3, advanced 3.3 percent to 187 yen. Credit Suisse also
assigned the three shippers “outperform” ratings.  Japan Tobacco Inc. gained 3.5 percent to 340,500 yen after
it said in a statement that selling the government’s 5 million
shares may raise about 1.7 trillion yen, and that the proceeds
should be used to help fund recovery efforts after Japan’s
record earthquake and tsunami.  To contact the reporters on this story:
