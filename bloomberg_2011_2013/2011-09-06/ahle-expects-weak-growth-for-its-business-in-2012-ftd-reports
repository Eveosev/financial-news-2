Mahle GmbH predicts “weak growth”
for its business in 2012 as the global cost of raw materials
continues to climb,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported, citing
an interview with Chief Executive Heinz Junker.  The German engine parts manufacturer expects record revenue
of 5.8 billion euros this year, driven by acquisitions, the FTD
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
