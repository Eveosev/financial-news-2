Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  said flight
cancellations from  Hurricane Irene  reduced August net profit by
$15 million, joining  US Airways Group Inc. (LCC)  in kicking off the
airline industry’s tally of costs from the storm.  Irene cut operating income at  US Airways  by as much as $10
million, the Tempe, Arizona-based airline said in a U.S.
regulatory filing earlier today. Delta grounded more than 2,200
flights while US Airways scuttled about a quarter of its 9,100
scheduled departures from Aug. 27 through Aug. 29.  Other airlines may detail the financial drag from the
hurricane tomorrow at a Dahlman Rose & Co. transportation
conference in New York. Irene grounded more than 11,200 flights
as it traveled up the East Coast last month, and the industry
total may reach as much as $300 million pretax,  Michael Linenberg , a Deutsche Bank AG analyst, said in a Sept. 2 report.  “With the exception of the New York airports, this storm
was not as bad as a typical big blizzard,” Robert McAdoo, an
Avondale Partners LLC analyst, said in an interview today.
“Once the storm passes, there’s no snow to scoop, no planes to
deice. It goes back to normal pretty quickly.”  August passenger traffic at Delta and its regional carriers
fell 0.3 percent from a year earlier, the Atlanta-based carrier
said today. US Airways’ traffic on the same basis rose 1.1
percent, while unit revenue increased 9 percent.  Delta fell 14 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $7.13 at 4 p.m. in
 New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. US Airways dropped 18
cents, or 3.5 percent, to $5.04, leading declines by all 10
carriers in the Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
