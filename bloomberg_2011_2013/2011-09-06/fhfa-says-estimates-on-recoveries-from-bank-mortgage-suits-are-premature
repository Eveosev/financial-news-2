The U.S.  Federal Housing Finance
Agency , which sued 17 banks over $196 billion in mortgage-backed
securities bought by  Freddie Mac  and  Fannie Mae , said it’s
premature to estimate how much it may recover.  Damage estimates that said the FHFA is seeking about $200
billion from its suits -- the total cost of the securities --
are “excessive,” the agency said today in a statement it
called “a fuller statement of purpose.”  The agency, which represents the interests of Freddie Mac
and Fannie Mae, mortgage-finance companies under government
conservatorship, said actual damages would reflect “losses
incurred” or recoveries determined by evidence or judicial
findings.  In the relief section of the agency’s Sept. 2 complaints
against the banks, including  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM) , its first demand for relief asked for a
“rescission and recovery of the consideration” Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac paid the mortgage-backed securities.  Using the purchase price for the securities to gauge
damages doesn’t reflect repayments of principal or the remaining
value of the securities, which would offset any recovery, the
agency said in the statement.  “Such numbers reflect the original amount of such
securities purchased, not the losses incurred or the potential
recoveries at the end of this process,” the agency said in the
clarifying statement.  The cases are  Federal Housing Finance Agency v. Bank of
America Corp., 11-CV-6195; FHFA v. Barclays Bank Plc., 11-CV-
6190; FHFA v. Citigroup, 11-CV-6196; FHFA v. Credit Suisse
