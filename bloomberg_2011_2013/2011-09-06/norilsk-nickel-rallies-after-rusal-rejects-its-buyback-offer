OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel advanced for
a second day after United Co. Rusal yesterday rejected an offer
for its 15 percent stake in Russia’s largest miner for $8.75
billion.  Norilsk’s shares climbed 1.2 percent to 7,167 rubles by the
6:45 p.m. close in Moscow.  Rusal’s board unanimously rejected Norilsk’s offer to buy
back the stake, the aluminum producer said in an e-mailed
statement.  “Norilsk should be supported in the short term by the
buyback price,” UralSib Financial Corp. analyst Dmitry Smolin,
wrote in an e-mailed report today. Smolin expects Norilsk Nickel
to make the same buyback offer to all other shareholders at the
same price within one-two weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
