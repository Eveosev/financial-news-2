Former Acting U.S. Solicitor General
Neal Katyal joined the Washington office of Hogan Lovells to
lead the law firm’s appellate practice alongside partner Cate
Stetson.  “Neal’s career is most impressive by any standard,”
Warren Gorrell, co-chief executive of Hogan Lovells, said today
in a statement announcing the hire. “His success in many
notable Supreme Court cases over the course of his career has
given him insight into some of the most complex and important
legal issues facing our country today.”  Katyal, who will be a partner at the firm, served as the
U.S. Justice Department’s top courtroom attorney and until last
month was the Obama administration’s lead litigator in federal
appellate arguments in defense of the health-care overhaul.
Katyal served in that role since Obama picked then-Solicitor
General Elena Kagan to join the U.S. Supreme Court last year.  Before joining government, Katyal was a law professor for
almost 15 years at Georgetown University Law Center in
Washington and was director of the school’s Center on National
Security and the Law, according to the statement. He has argued
15 U.S. Supreme Court cases including Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, in
which the court ruled military tribunals at Guantanamo Bay
unconstitutional, according to the statement.  “The breadth and depth of his experience in a wide variety
of appellate matters is unparalleled,” Stephen Immelt, co-chair
of the firm’s litigation, arbitration and employment practice,
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
