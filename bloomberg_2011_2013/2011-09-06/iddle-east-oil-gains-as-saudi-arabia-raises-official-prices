Middle East oil for sale to Asia
gained after Saudi Arabia raised its official prices, prompting
some refiners to consider regional alternatives.  Qatar Marine for November loading increased 5 cents to a
discount of 1 cent a barrel to its official level, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the world’s biggest exporter,
increased the selling price of Arab Light for October by 90
cents to a premium of $1.65 a barrel over the average of the
benchmarks Oman and Dubai grades. That’s the highest spread
since May and the largest monthly increase since January. Extra
Light prices rose 80 cents to a premium of $3.85, the highest
since June.  Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. cut official selling prices for
August-loading cargos for all of its four export grades, the
company said yesterday in a statement e-mailed to refiners.
Murban, the emirate’s biggest crude by volume, fell 4.3 percent
from July to $109.05 a barrel. Its premium is $4.03 over the
price Dubai published via Platts for the same period, according
to Bloomberg calculations.  Oman crude for immediate loading fell 85 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $106.06 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai oil
for delivery in November declined 0.8 percent to $105.68. Murban
dropped 0.7 percent to $109.77.  Oman futures for November delivery fell $1.26 to $106.79 a
barrel on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange at 4:54 p.m. Singapore
time, with 2,201 contracts traded. The settlement price was
$106.76 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The October Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European marker contract against the Persian Gulf grade,
