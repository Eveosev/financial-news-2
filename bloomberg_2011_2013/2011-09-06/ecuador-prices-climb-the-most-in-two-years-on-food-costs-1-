Consumer prices in Ecuador, which
uses the  U.S. dollar  as its official currency, rose at the
fastest annual pace in more than two years in August, led by
food.  The inflation rate climbed to 4.84 percent, its highest
level since May 2009, from 4.44 percent the month before, the
National Statistics and Census Institute said on its  website 
today. In the month, prices rose 0.49 percent.  Ecuador, South America’s seventh-biggest economy, has seen
food prices leap 7.3 percent in the 12 months through August as
droughts in coastal areas and flooding in the highland Andes
damaged crops. Global commodity price increases, internal supply
problems and increasing consumer demand are pressuring costs,
according to the Economic Policy Ministry.  Producer prices rose 1.41 percent in August from the month
before and jumped 5.1 percent from a year earlier, according to
the report.  Prices gained the most in the highland Andean city of
Ambato, rising an annual 7.44 percent, while gaining 5.14
percent in the nation’s largest city, Guayaquil, the statistics
agency said. Ecuador, the smallest member of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, subsidizes fuel costs and the
domestic use of natural gas.  Inflation is forecast to quicken to 4.13 percent this year,
while the economy may expand 5.24 percent, the  Finance Ministry 
said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
