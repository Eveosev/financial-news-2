The sugar surplus for 2011-12 will
be 9.16 million metric tons, down from a previous estimate of
10.58 million because of slower demand growth, Kingsman SA, a
Lausanne, Switzerland, researcher, said.  Consumption will climb 1 percent to 164.083 million tons,
half the 2 percent growth previously estimated because of “high
world prices and the slowing world economy,”  Jonathan Kingsman ,
chief executive officer of Kingsman, said in a statement. The
forecast was reduced for output in Center South  Brazil  and  China 
and increased for beet crops led by Russia and Ukraine, he said.  The 2011-12 season starts Oct. 1 in most countries. There
was a surplus of 4.3 million tons in 2010-11 and a shortage of
7.6 million tons in 2009-10, according to the statement.  Yields for the crop in Center South Brazil “continue to
disappoint,” and there is potential for damage to crops in
Thailand because of floods and in China and  East Africa  because
of drought, Kingsman said. “Taking all this together we expect
that we will at a later stage once again have to revise down our
surplus estimates,” he said. This is the third estimate by
Kingsman for 2011-12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
