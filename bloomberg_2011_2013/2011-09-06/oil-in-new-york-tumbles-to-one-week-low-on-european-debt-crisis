Oil in  New York  fell to the lowest
level in more than a week as speculation that the European debt
crisis is spreading pressured the euro and equities. Brent
crude’s premium to West Texas Intermediate climbed to a record.  Prices declined 0.5 percent as European stocks dropped to
the lowest level since July 2009 on concern the region’s debt
crisis will derail the recovery. Crude pared a loss of as much
as 3.8 percent after the government reported at 2 p.m. New York
time that 61 percent of  Gulf of Mexico  output remained shut in
after Tropical Storm Lee made landfall in Louisiana Sept. 4.  “All markets, including crude, continue to get rattled by
this European situation and a sense that there’s certainly no
silver bullet on the immediate horizon to help this economy,”
said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a  New York- 
based hedge fund that focuses on energy. “We’re going to see
these sell-offs hit us with regularity.”  Oil for October delivery slipped 43 cents to $86.02 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
settlement price since Aug. 26. Prices have fallen 5.9 percent
this year.  Floor trading was closed yesterday for the U.S. Labor Day
holiday and electronic trades will be booked with today’s
transactions for settlement purposes. Global equities fell
yesterday, Italian bonds dropped for an 11th day and the cost of
government and bank default insurance rose to records amid
Europe’s debt crisis.  Brent for October settlement rose $2.81, or 2.6 percent, to
$112.89 a barrel on the ICE Futures  Europe  Exchange. Brent
dropped 2 percent yesterday. The European benchmark’s $26.87
premium of $26.87 to U.S. futures breaching the previous high of
$26.21 set Aug. 19.  Declining Euro  “People are just worried about the economy,” said  Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in
Winchester,  Massachusetts . “It’s hard to see any reason to be
bullish and people are in sell-off mode now.”  The euro weakened against the dollar for a sixth day,
curbing commodities’ appeal as an alternative investment. The
euro fell 0.7 percent to $1.3993 at 3:47 p.m. in New York from
$1.4098 yesterday. It declined 0.8 percent yesterday.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.7 percent to
1,165.24, and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 0.9 percent
to 11,139.30 at 4:03 p.m. in New York.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slid 0.7 percent to 221.98 at
the 4:30 p.m. close in London after earlier climbing as much as
1 percent. The gauge has tumbled 7.1 percent over the past three
days.  Tropical Storm Lee  About 846,670 barrels a day of oil production in the Gulf
of Mexico has been curtailed because of Tropical Storm Lee as of
11:30 a.m. Houston time today, the Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management, Regulation and Enforcement  said  on its website. That
compares with 858,935 barrels the day before. About 2.2 billion
cubic feet in daily gas production has been shut in, compared
with 2.44 billion yesterday.  Earlier, oil and equities trimmed losses after a gauge of
U.S. service industries showed faster-than-forecast growth.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s index of non-
manufacturing businesses increased to 53.3 last month from 52.7
in July. Economists forecast the gauge would drop to 51,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. A
Chinese services index published yesterday fell to a record low
in August. The U.S. and  China  are the world’s top two oil-
consuming countries.  Swiss Central Bank  A drop in the dollar following  Switzerland ’s attempt to cap
the value of its currency also made raw materials more
attractive to investors before U.S. floor trading began.  Brent futures rose as the dollar plunged after the  Swiss
National Bank  said it’s setting a minimum franc exchange against
the euro. The currency later advanced.  “If the dollar falters, that will help oil,” said
 Christopher Bellew , a senior broker at Jefferies Bache Ltd. in
 London , who correctly predicted Brent wouldn’t go higher than
$120 this summer. “In spite of the dire state of Western
economies, I think demand in China and other emerging nations,
the potential for hurricane shut-ins and unrest in the Middle
East mean prices will go back up.”  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 493,721
contracts as of 4:28 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 574,816
contracts Sept. 2, 16 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.52 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
