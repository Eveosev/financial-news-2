Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  introduced
the first BlackBerry that will work on  China Mobile Ltd. (941) ’s
homegrown third-generation wireless technology network.  The BlackBerry Bold 9788 supports China Mobile’s TD-SCDMA
network, as well as Wi-Fi, the companies said in an e-mailed
statement today.  China Mobile is adding smartphones to keep its lead over
China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. among users of high-speed, third-
generation networks. Unicom is the nation’s only carrier that
offers  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone with a service contract, helping it
close the gap with China Mobile in the battle for users who surf
the Web and download games and videos on their phones.  China Mobile in January 2009 received its 3G license for
the Time Division Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access, or
TD-SCDMA network. The Chinese system was developed as an
alternative to the global W-CDMA and CDMA2000 standards.  China Mobile had 37.6 million subscribers on its 3G TD-
SCDMA network at the end of July, while  China Unicom (762)  had 25.8
million subscribers on its W-CDMA network in the same period.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
