European investors account for about
10 percent of trading in U.S.-listed equity options and demand
will grow amid increased demand for hedging, according to a
study by research firm Tabb Group LLC.  Hedge funds represented 58 percent of the European
investors, followed by private wealth managers, who accounted
for 18 percent, the report said. Large European banks,
proprietary trading firms and market makers represented 15
percent of trading from Europe and asset managers 5 percent,
according to Tabb. The study forecast total U.S. options volume
will rise to a record 4.6 billion contracts in 2011, the ninth
consecutive annual increase.  “European demand for U.S.-listed equity options will
increase due to global regulatory efforts to reduce risk,” Andy Nybo, an analyst at  Tabb , wrote in the report. “Institutional
investors are increasingly using listed derivatives to reduce
portfolio risk exposures.”  U.S. options volume rose to a record last month, driving
stock price swings in the last hour of trading to the widest
since the bull market began, as investors speculated on
volatility and sought protection from losses. Volume jumped last
month to a record 550 million contracts, valued at $221 billion,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg and Chicago-based
Options Clearing Corp., which settles all trading of exchange-
listed contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
