Electricite de France SA and  BASF SE (BAS) 
will enter the planned South Stream pipeline to Europe with 15
percent stakes each, said  Alexei Miller , the head of OAO
Gazprom,  Russia ’s gas export monopoly.  Eni SpA (ENI) ’s share in the project will shrink to 20 percent,
Miller told Prime Minister Vladimir Putin today near Vyborg,
northwestern Russia, according to his spokesman Sergei
Kupriyanov. Gazprom, the world’s biggest gas producer, will
maintain its 50 percent.  Russia seeks to deliver as much as 63 billion cubic meters
of natural gas a year directly to the European Union under the
Black Sea via South Stream. Gazprom plans it as a second link
bypassing Ukraine and other transit nations, after starting to
fill the Nord Stream pipeline to  Germany  today. Pricing disputes
between Russia and Ukraine have led to supply disruptions in
Europe at least twice since 2006.  Shareholders plan to sign the agreement on Sept. 16, Miller
said, inviting Putin to attend.  The pipeline will run 900 kilometers (560 miles) under the
sea to the Balkans and may cost 15.5 billion euros ($21.8
billion), including the onshore section in Europe. South Stream
may have to vie for customers with EU-backed projects running
from the  Caspian region  across Turkey, which aim to diversify
supplies away from Russia. Gazprom supplies about 25 percent of
the EU’s gas.  Eni’s press service didn’t immediately respond to requests
for comment when called by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
