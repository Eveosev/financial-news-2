Glencore International Plc, the
largest publicly traded commodities supplier, raised its stake
in  Optimum Coal Holdings (OPT)  Ltd., buying shares at 12 percent above
the price it proposed last week.  Glencore’s Piruto BV unit purchased 24.6 million shares on
the market yesterday at 38 rand ($5.34) apiece, taking the Baar,
Switzerland-based company’s stake to 23.9 percent, it said today
in a statement. Glencore acquired 14.1 percent of Optimum on
Aug. 29 and on Sept. 1 proposed a cash offer of 34 rand a share
that valued the South African company at $1.2 billion.  Under takeover regulations, “if an offer is made by
Glencore or any of its concert parties for the remaining shares
in Optimum within a period of six months from the date of this
announcement, the offer consideration will not be lower than 38
rand per share,” according to the statement.  Optimum Coal is  South Africa ’s fourth-largest coal exporter
and owns mines and port capacity. Glencore said last week it had
secured agreements that may expand its holding to 43.5 percent.  Glencore gained 2.3 percent to 385.2 pence at the 4:30 p.m.
close in London trading. Optimum fell 2.6 percent to 37.01 rand
in Johannesburg. An offer of 38 rand a share would value the
company at about $1.34 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
