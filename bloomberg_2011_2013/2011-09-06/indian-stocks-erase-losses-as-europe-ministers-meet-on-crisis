Indian stocks gained, reversing the
benchmark index’s earlier loss of as much as 1.4 percent, after
European shares advanced on optimism a meeting of the region’s
ministers today may help tackle its debt crisis.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , the nation’s most valued company,
rallied 4.1 percent. BP Plc is confident of raising output from
Reliance’s fields in  India , Sashi Mukundan, the British
company’s chief in the South Asian nation, said today.  Mahindra
& Mahindra Ltd. (MM) , the biggest sports-utility vehicle maker,
climbed to close at a nine-month high.  “Investors globally are hoping some progress will be made
and measures would be taken to resolve Europe’s debt crisis,”
said Sunil Pachisia, vice president at Mumbai-based brokerage
Pratibhuti Viniyog Ltd. “The rebound in Indian stocks was also
on account of some short-covering in the markets.”  The BSE India Sensitive Index, or Sensex, advanced 149.48,
or 0.9 percent, to 16,862.81 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai,
its highest level since Aug. 11. As many as 19 of the 30 index
stocks climbed. The S&P CNX Nifty Index gained 0.9 percent to
5,064.30 while its September futures traded at 5,068.25. The
BSE-200 Index added 0.7 percent to 2,087.35.  European stocks rebounded today from their biggest two-day
drop since March 2009. The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index rose as much
as 1 percent after losing 6.5 percent in the previous two
sessions. Ministers from  Germany ,  Finland  and the Netherlands
will meet today to discuss a Finnish demand for collateral in a
bailout for  Greece , while the Italian Senate will debate an
austerity plan amid a strike.  FIIs Withdraw  The Sensex lost 8.4 percent last month, the worst August in
at least 10 years, as overseas funds sold $2.1 billion worth of
local stocks in the month, the biggest monthly outflow since
October 2008. Equities fell amid concerns the global economic
growth is slowing as Europe’s sovereign debt crisis spreads and
after  Standard & Poor’s  cut the U.S. credit rating.  The Indian stock gauge has slid 18 percent in 2011, the
worst performer after  Brazil ’s Bovespa Index among major indexes
in the 10 biggest markets, as the  Reserve Bank  of India’s 11
interest-rate increases since March 2010 hurt company earnings,
dragging valuations lower.  Companies on the measure trade at 14.2 times estimated
earnings, down from 21.5 times last March. The MSCI Emerging
Markets Index trades at 9.9 times.  Reliance surged 4.1 percent to 821.5 rupees, the highest
close in more than a month and the biggest gainer on the Sensex.  BP Expertise  Raising output may take a couple of years, Mukundan said.
BP last month completed the acquisition of a 30 percent stake in
21 blocks that Reliance operates in India. Reliance plans to tap
BP’s expertise to boost output from fields including India’s
biggest gas deposit, which has been in decline.  “The comments from BP are pretty positive,” Deven Choksey, managing director of Mumbai-based brokerage K.R.
Choksey Shares & Securities Pvt., said by telephone. They
“boosted investor sentiment for Reliance shares.”  Mahindra rallied 3.7 percent to 797.30 rupees, its highest
close since Dec. 7. The stock has climbed 14 percent in six
trading sessions including today, the biggest six-day gain since
March 2010.  Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL) , the country’s largest
power-equipment maker, jumped 2.6 percent to 1,755.90 rupees
while  Jindal Steel & Power Ltd. (JSP) , the second-biggest producer by
value, rose 2.9 percent to 549.55 rupees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
