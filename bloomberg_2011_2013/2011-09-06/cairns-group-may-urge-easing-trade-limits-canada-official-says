The Cairns Group, a coalition of 19
agricultural exporting countries, may recommend an easing of
global trade restrictions after a meeting this week, a Canadian
government official said.  Representatives of the group’s member countries plan
meetings that start tomorrow in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, before
a World Trade Organization ministerial meeting in December, the
senior official with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada said today
on a conference call with reporters. He declined to be
identified because he wasn’t allowed to speak on the record.  The group also will discuss non-tariff trade measures, food
security and Russia’s bid to enter the WTO, the official said.
The Cairns Group doesn’t include the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
