Copper futures declined amid concern
that the  euro-zone  nations will be unable to control the
sovereign-debt crisis, damping the outlook for the global
economy and curb demand for raw materials.  Three-month copper on the  London  Metal Exchange dropped as
much as 1 percent to $8,870 a metric ton, the lowest intra-day
level since Aug. 25, and traded at $8,890.25 as of 3:32 p.m.
Seoul time. December-delivery copper on the Comex in  New York 
dropped 2.4 percent to $4.0275 a pound.  The cost of insuring against default on European sovereign

a statement issued by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics.  “The economic outlook is really weak,”  David Thurtell ,
head of metals research at Citigroup Inc. said by phone from
Sydney today. “There’s not a lot to be bullish about base
metals in the near term.”  Citigroup yesterday lowered its 2011 copper price forecast

citing the bank’s reduced economic growth forecast for the U.S.,
the euro zone and India. Copper, used in power cables and
construction, has lost 13 percent from a record $10,190 touched

strikes will support copper, Australia and New Zealand Banking

in a report.  Copper output in  Chile , the world’s biggest producer of the
metal, is poised to decline this year after snowstorms and
strikes hit mines owned by BHP Billiton Ltd. and Codelco, Mining

tons. The nation produced 5.42 million tons last year.  Workers at  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) ’s Grasberg

union said yesterday. Grasberg’s copper production at the mine
