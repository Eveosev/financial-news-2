Poland’s benchmark stock index fell,
heading for the longest losing streak in four weeks, as banks
resumed declines on signs Europe’s debt crisis is spreading and
amid concern global economic growth is slowing.  The WIG20 Index declined 0.6 percent to 2,263.98 at 2:55
p.m. in Warsaw, retreating for a fourth day. The index jumped as
much as 2 percent earlier today after the zloty’s surge against
the Swiss franc boosted lenders, reducing risk that homeowners
who bought property with foreign-currency loans will default.  PKO Bank Polski SA, the country’s biggest bank, slid 1.5
percent to 32.4 zloty.  Getin Holding SA (GTN) , the financial-services
group controlled by billionaire Leszek Czarnecki, lost 2.5
percent to 7.9 zloty.  BRE Bank SA (BRE) , a unit of Commerzbank AG,
declined 1.7 percent to 230.1 zloty.  PZU SA, Poland’s biggest insurer, sank 3.8 percent to 328
zloty, heading for the lowest close in more than a week.  Asseco Poland SA, central Europe’s biggest software
developer, slumped 4.7 percent to 39.1 zloty after shareholders
rejected a management proposal to buy back shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
