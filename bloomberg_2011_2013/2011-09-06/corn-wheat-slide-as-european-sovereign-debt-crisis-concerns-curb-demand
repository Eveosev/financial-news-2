Corn and wheat dropped on concerns
that  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis will worsen and dent the
outlook for the global economy, damping demand for grains.
Soybeans also declined.  December-delivery corn fell as much as 1.7 percent to
$7.4725 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and traded at
$7.50 by 2:45 p.m. in  Singapore . Futures climbed 15 percent last
month and are up 19 percent this year.  European equities slumped yesterday after an election loss
for German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party boosted concern that
opposition to bailouts of Europe’s indebted nations may increase.
U.S. stock futures fell today, indicating the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index may slide for a third day.  “The movements we’ve had in the grain markets simply
reflect a catch-up to the global risk-off appetite that has
swept through the financial markets over the past couple of
sessions,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at Commonwealth
Bank of  Australia , said by phone from Sydney. “The agricultural
markets, despite the fact that supplies are tight, have
currently been caught up in that selling pressure.”  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 4.1 percent to 223.45
yesterday as all 19 industry groups dropped. Standard & Poor’s
500 Index futures expiring in September fell as much as 2.8
percent today. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped as much as
1.8 percent, heading for a third day of declines. U.S. markets
were closed for Labor Day yesterday.  Debt Debate  Finance ministers from  Germany ,  Finland  and the Netherlands
will meet today to discuss a Finnish demand for collateral in a
bailout for  Greece . Italian lawmakers will debate an austerity
plan amid a strike called by the nation’s biggest union.  “The grain market is currently being torn between the
darkening global economic outlook and extremely tight coarse
grain supplies,” Mathews wrote in an e-mailed report today.  Global corn stockpiles were forecast by the  U.S. Department
of Agriculture  to plunge in the 2011-2012 season to 114.5
million metric tons. That would be the lowest level in five
years as hot weather in the U.S., the world’s largest grower and
exporter, curbs yields and demand climbs.  Demand for wheat will exceed production for a second
straight year in 2011-2012, while global production of soybeans
will drop 2.5 percent from a year earlier to 257.5 million tons,
according to the agency.  Wheat for December delivery slumped 1.4 percent to $7.65 a
bushel, after gaining 11 percent last month. Soybeans for
November delivery fell 1.3 percent to $14.2775 a bushel. The
oilseed advanced 1.6 percent last week.  To contact the reporter for this story:
