Actor  Robert De Niro  and former U.S.
Secretary of State  Colin Powell  will be among the people paying
tribute to victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on
the 10th anniversary of the tragedies during this week’s
 National Football League  games in Washington and New York.  At MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford,  New Jersey , the  Jets 
will turn off the stadium lights at halftime of their 8:20 p.m.
game against the  Dallas Cowboys  for a video tribute, featuring
New York native De Niro narrating a story created by family
members of 9/11 victims.  At FedEx Field in Landover, Maryland, Powell, will serve as
the  Redskins’  honorary captain for the team’s 4:15 p.m. start
against the  New York   Giants .  Before all 4:15 p.m.  National Football League  games, teams
will play a message from the NFL that will include images from
Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. About 3,000 people died
in the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York, the
Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and in Pennsylvania where a
plane taken over by terrorists crashed.  The NFL and its players union will contribute $500,000 to
the 9/11 Museum & Memorial in Lower Manhattan, and $125,000 each
to the Flight 93 National Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania,
and the Pentagon Memorial Fund in Washington, D.C.  They will also auction items from games played on Sept. 11
including game-worn autographed player jerseys and coach and
player hats, which fans can bid on at www.NFL.com/Auction.  The auction proceeds, estimated to generate $250,000, will
be divided equally between Tuesday’s Children, which provides
support to those who lost a loved one on 9/11 and rescue and
recovery workers, and MyGoodDeed, the principle organizer of the
Sept. 11 National Day of Service and Remembrance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
