Advanced Info Service Pcl (ADVANC)  and other
Thai mobile-phone companies rose in Bangkok trading after the
Senate selected members of a new regulator for the broadcasting
and telecommunications industry.  Advanced Info, Thailand’s largest mobile-phone company,
rose 3.5 percent to 119 baht at the 4:30 p.m. close on the Stock
Exchange of Thailand, the most since July 4.  Total Access
Communication Pcl (DTAC) , the second-biggest, climbed 3.2 percent to
72.5 baht, the highest since the stock listed in June 2007. True
Corp. Pcl jumped 5.1 percent to 4.16 baht.  The gains may reflect optimism after Thailand’s Senate
approved 11 members of the nation’s new telecommunications
regulator yesterday. Delays in setting up the National
Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission were blamed for
the slow adoption of high-speed mobile technologies in  Thailand .  “The formation of the new regulator will speed up the
bidding for high-speed mobile-phone licenses after the long
delay,” Porranee Thongyen, an analyst at Asia Plus Securities
Pcl, wrote in a report today. “All mobile-phone companies will
benefit from the new licenses, which enable them to expand into
new businesses with lower royalty costs than the existing
contracts.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
