Sacyr Vallehermoso SA (SYV)  investor Grupo
Empresarial Fuertes SL supports an accord between two of  Repsol
YPF SA (REP) ’s biggest shareholders and says the oil company will
remain under Spanish control,  Expansion  reported, citing Grupo
Fuertes president Tomas Fuertes.  The deal between Sacyr and Petroleos Mexicanos to jointly
vote their almost 30 percent stake in Repsol may create
synergies for Repsol and Sacyr intends to remain a “stable and
permanent” shareholder in the company, Expansion cited Fuertes
as saying.  Grupo Fuertes has a 5 percent stake in Sacyr, the newspaper
added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
