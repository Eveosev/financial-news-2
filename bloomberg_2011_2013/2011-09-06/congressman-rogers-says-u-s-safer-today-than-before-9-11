U.S. Representative Mike Rogers,
chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said the U.S. is
safer today than before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.  “I think we are,” Rogers, a Michigan Republican, said in
response to a question today on Bloomberg Television.  The improved security situation does not make terrorist
groups such as al-Qaeda “less dangerous,” he said.  Rogers said the U.S. intelligence community is more aware
of terrorism threats and has been “more vigilant” in targeting
financing and other infrastructure.  “We’ve made it difficult for them to operate in normal
banking channels,” he said.  Al-Qaeda has expressed an interest in obtaining missiles
and other weapons from stockpiles in  Libya , according to Rogers.
The U.S., he said, must adopt an “aggressive posture in
finding, securing and rendering safe those weapons systems.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
