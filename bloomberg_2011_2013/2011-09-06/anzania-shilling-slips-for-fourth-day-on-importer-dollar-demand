Tanzania’s shilling weakened for a
fourth day as oil importers increased demand for dollars.  The currency of East Africa’s second-biggest economy
depreciated 0.2 percent to 1,625.5 per dollar by 1:22 p.m. in
Dar es Salaam, the commercial capital, heading for the weakest
closing level since Aug. 18.  “We have seen significant demand for the dollar coming in
from the oil sector mainly,” Zainul Chandoo, head treasurer of
Standard Bank Group Ltd.’s local unit, said by phone.  Tanzania’s shilling has lost 8.7 percent this year, making
it Africa’s worst performer after the Ugandan and Kenyan
currencies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
shilling weakened as Tanzania’s inflation rate climbed to 13
percent in July, the fastest pace in 15 months, on higher energy
and food costs, the National Bureau of Statistics said Aug. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
