A gauge of  Australia ’s building
industry fell last month to the lowest level in almost 2 1/2
years as new orders and hiring slumped.  The construction performance index fell 4 points to 32.1 in
August, the 15th consecutive contraction and the lowest level
since March 2009, according to a survey by the Australian
Industry Group and the Housing Industry Association released in
Sydney today. A reading below 50 indicates the industry is
contracting.  Reserve Bank Governor Glenn Stevens held the benchmark
 interest rate  at 4.75 percent yesterday, after boosting it seven
times from October 2009 to November. Australian employers added
41,400 jobs during the first seven months of the year, the
weakest January-July period since 2003, as a rising currency
hurts manufacturers including BlueScope Steel Ltd.  “The prolonged downturn in the construction sector is
detracting from current levels of activity across the broader
economy through its impacts on manufacturing and service
industries linked to the sector,” said Peter Burn, director of
public policy at the Australian Industry Group. “Construction
employment has also been falling for some time.”  The government has been scaling back fiscal stimulus
measures, and Treasurer  Wayne Swan  said in May it will end 23
years of spending growth to help return to a  budget surplus .  New orders plunged 7.1 points to 24.5 and a gauge of
employment slumped 5.1 points points to 34.9 last month, the
report showed. Engineering work slid 0.6 point to 38.2 while
commercial construction work fell 8 points to 29.4, it showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
