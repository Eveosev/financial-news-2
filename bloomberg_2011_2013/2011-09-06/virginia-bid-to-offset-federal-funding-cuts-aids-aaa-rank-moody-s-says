Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell’s
proposal to set aside $30 million to offset the impact of any
federal budget cuts is a positive step toward keeping the
state’s AAA credit rating, Moody’s Investors Service said.  Virginia, which receives the most federal funding per
capita after Alaska, is among five states that Moody’s said
could lose top bond rankings because of their reliance on U.S.
money.  On Aug. 18, McDonnell proposed using part of the state’s
$545 million budget surplus to mitigate any spending cuts
proposed by Congress. A committee of Democrats and Republicans
is charged with shaving $1.5 trillion from the federal budget
over the next decade.  “The fund, which is part of the governor’s strategy to
counteract anticipated reductions in federal spending, would be
credit positive for the state,” Lisa Heller, a Moody’s analyst,
wrote in the rating company’s weekly outlook.  “Virginia, like many states, still faces challenges ahead,
including an overvalued housing sector, the sluggish national
recovery and the deferral of retirement contributions,” she
wrote. “Its early acknowledgment of the coming federal cuts,
coupled with budget surpluses, however, will allow some
flexibility to counteract the cuts and reduce its dependence on
defense and federal procurement.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
