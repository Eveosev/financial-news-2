South Africa  should scrap plans for
more toll roads and direct the money to boosting public
transport, Business Day reported, citing Deputy Transport
Minister Jeremy Cronin.  The position follows a public outcry over toll roads on
urban roads in Gauteng province, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper cited Cronin as saying. The comments are in contrast
to the departmentâ€™s stance as there are plans to expand tolls
roads to other parts of the country, Business Day said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
