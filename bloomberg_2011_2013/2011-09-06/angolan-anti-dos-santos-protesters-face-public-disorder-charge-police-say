A group of Angolan anti-government
protesters face public-disorder charges today after
demonstrations demanding an end to the 32-year rule of President
Jose Eduardo  dos Santos , police spokesman Carmo Neto said.  “People are free to protest,” Neto said by phone today
from Luanda, the capital. “We don’t want them throwing
stones.”  Twenty-four youths were arrested by police on Sept. 3
during a demonstration by about 300 people against Dos Santos’s
rule, power and water shortages and corruption in sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s second-biggest oil producer, Radio Ecclesia reported
yesterday.  Angola  should immediately end the use of “unnecessary and
disproportionate” force against demonstrators,  Human Rights
Watch  said in a statement on its website.  Police had refused to confirm the whereabouts of those
people arrested during the demonstrations, the New York-based
group said in a statement on its website, dated yesterday.
Unidentified men also attacked journalists in an attempt to stop
them reporting on the protest, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
