Cameroon’s ports handled 7.5 percent
more goods in 2010 than the previous year, the National Ports
Authority said.  Traffic rose to 7.9 million metric tons from 7.3 million
tons, almost all of it passing through the main port of Douala,
the authority said in a statement handed to reporters today in
Yaounde, the West African nation’s capital.  Imports represented 73 percent of the total traffic. The
Central African nation imported 1.7 million tons of food
products in 2010 and 1.3 million tons of metal products,
including construction materials and heavy duty engines, the
report said. Major exports included 1.2 million tons of timber
and 612,000 tons of agricultural products, it said.  About 45 percent of transactions were with three
neighboring countries, the Central African Republic, the
Republic of Congo and Chad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
