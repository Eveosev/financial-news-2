Gold fell from a record as some
investors sold metal to cover losses in the Swiss franc after
the country’s central bank imposed a ceiling to the  exchange
rate .  The franc tumbled after the bank set a minimum exchange
rate of 1.20 per euro and said it will defend the target with
the “utmost determination” if needed. Ministers from  Germany ,
Finland and the Netherlands meet today to discuss a Finnish
demand for collateral in a bailout for Greece, while the Italian
Senate will debate an austerity plan amid a strike.  “Those long the Swiss franc are likely long gold, so both
positions are cut at the same time,”  Sebastien Galy , senior
currency strategist at Societe Generale SA, said today in an e-
mail. The move by the Swiss bank “suggests that we will go
‘risk on’ now, which is not good for gold.”  Gold for immediate delivery fell $25.98, or 1.4 percent, to
$1,874.25 an ounce at 7:46 p.m. in  London . Prices earlier today
touched a record $1,921.15.  On the Comex in  New York , gold futures for December
delivery declined $3.60, or 0.2 percent, to settle at $1,873.30
at 1:48 p.m., after touching an all-time high of $1,923.70.
Floor trading on the Comex was shut yesterday for Labor Day.  “We are seeing some profit taking,”  Matthew Zeman , a
strategist at Kingsview Financial in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview. “The strength in the dollar is also
pushing gold down.”  The dollar rose 1.1 percent against a basket of six
currencies, heading for the biggest gain since Aug. 4.  Silver futures for December delivery retreated $1.201, or
2.8 percent, to close at $41.868 an ounce on the Comex.  Platinum futures for October delivery declined $26.60, or
1.4 percent, to $1,858.20 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Palladium futures for December delivery slumped
$33.65, or 4.3 percent, to $749.55 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporters on this story:
