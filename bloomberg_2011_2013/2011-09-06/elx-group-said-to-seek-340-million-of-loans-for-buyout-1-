Telx Group Inc., the operator of
network-neutral interconnection facilities, is seeking $340
million of loans to finance its leveraged buyout by Abry
Partners and Berkshire Partners LLC, according to a person with
knowledge of the transaction.  Morgan Stanley and  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)  are arranging the
deal, which includes a $290 million  term loan  B and a $50
million revolving line of credit, said the person, who declined
to be identified because the terms are private. The banks will
host a lender meeting on Sept. 8 at 10:30 a.m. in New York.  Abry and Berkshire are purchasing New York-based Telx for
an undisclosed amount from GI Partners, according to an Aug. 8
company  statement . Lawrence Hamelsky, managing director at
Berkshire, the Boston-based private-equity firm, didn’t respond
to an e-mail seeking comment.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan, it can’t. A term loan B is
sold mainly to non-bank lenders such as collateralized loan
obligations, bank loan mutual fund and hedge funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
