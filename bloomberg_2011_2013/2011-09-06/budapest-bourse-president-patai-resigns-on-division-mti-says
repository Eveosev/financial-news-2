Budapest Stock Exchange President
Mihaly Patai resigned,  MTI  news service reported, without saying
where it got the information.  Patai probably quit because he failed to win a consensus on
the introduction of the Xetra trading platform, which five of
 Hungary ’s biggest brokers said yesterday could erode the capital
market, MTI said.  The bourse, whose majority shareholder is the Vienna-based
CEE Stock Exchange Group, is holding an extraordinary
shareholders’ meeting today on the introduction of the trading
platform.  To contact the reporters on this story:
