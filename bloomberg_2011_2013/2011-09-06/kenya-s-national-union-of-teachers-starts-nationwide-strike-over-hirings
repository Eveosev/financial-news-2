Kenya’s National Union of Teachers
began a nationwide strike today, demanding that the government
hire another 28,000 teachers to ease the workload in public
schools, said David Okuta, the organization’s secretary general.  “The union, having failed to persuade the government to
employ more teachers, has called a nationwide strike for all
teachers which will continue until the government meets the
demand,” Okuta told a news conference in the capital, Nairobi.
The union has 235,000 members in primary and secondary schools.  Union officials failed to resolve the dispute during talks
yesterday with the Prime Minister  Raila Odinga , he said.  “The government position is that it needs a week to secure
funding for the employment of more teachers, a position that
still stands,” Dennis Onyango, the prime minister’s spokesman,
said by telephone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
