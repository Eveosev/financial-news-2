Ukraine must become more transparent
for the European Union to agree to closer trade and political
relations with the country, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk
said.  “I’m concerned about standards in Ukraine regarding the
government’s behavior toward the opposition,” Tusk said at a
press conference today in Warsaw. Poland currently holds the
EU’s six-month rotating presidency.  Former Ukrainian Prime Minister  Yulia Tymoshenko , a leader
of the 2004 Orange Revolution, remains in police detention after
she was arrested on Aug. 5 in connection with a claim by public
prosecutors that her government agreed to pay too much for
deliveries of Russian natural gas in 2009.  Ukrainian President  Viktor Yanukovych  has said he wants to
sign an Association Agreement this year with the EU in an effort
to steer the former Soviet state toward membership in the bloc.  “The relations between the authorities and the opposition
in a country that wants an Association Agreement with the EU
have to be honest and transparent,” Tusk said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
