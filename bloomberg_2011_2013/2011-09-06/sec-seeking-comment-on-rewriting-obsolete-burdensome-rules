The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission is seeking comments on how it should review its
securities rules in response to a presidential order that
agencies deal with outmoded or unnecessarily burdensome
regulations.  The SEC has opened a one-month public comment period “on
the process it should use to conduct retrospective reviews, such
as how often rules should be reviewed, the factors that should
be considered, and ways to improve public participation in the
rulemaking process,” the agency said in a statement today. The
SEC said in its request that it’s not looking for advice on
specific rules.  President  Barack Obama  issued a July 11 executive  order 
calling for independent agencies like the SEC to “consider how
best to promote retrospective analysis of rules that may be
outmoded, ineffective, insufficient, or excessively
burdensome.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
