Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. won the
backing of the U.K.’s health-cost agency for its Mepact bone-
cancer drug.  Mepact is approved for use with chemotherapy after surgery
for bone cancers that haven’t spread, the  National Institute for
Health and Clinical Excellence  said in an e-mailed statement
today. The approval is conditional on Takeda providing a price
discount, which it has agreed to do, according to the statement.  The agency, known as NICE, reversed a decision from last
year in which it rejected the drug. The initial economic
analysis may not have adequately captured the health-related
quality of life from the drug, NICE said in the statement.  The agency advises the  National Health Service  on which
medicines represent value for money as the U.K. government works
to save as much as 20 billion pounds a year on medical expenses.  NICE will issue final guidelines after hearing any appeals.
The terms of the discount are confidential at the company’s
request, NICE said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
