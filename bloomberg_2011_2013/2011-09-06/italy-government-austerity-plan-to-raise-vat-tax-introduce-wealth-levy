Italy’s austerity package will
increase the value-added tax rate by one percentage point to 21
percent and apply a 3 percent levy on incomes of more than
500,000 euros a year.  The Cabinet will meet today in Rome to authorize a
confidence vote in Parliament on the measures, which will also
include raising the retirement age of women in the private
sector starting from 2014, according to an e-mailed statement
from Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s office.  The Cabinet will meet again on Sept. 8 to approve a draft
of a separate bill aimed at introducing an amendement in the
nation’s constitution requiring a balanced budget and
eliminating provincial administrations, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
