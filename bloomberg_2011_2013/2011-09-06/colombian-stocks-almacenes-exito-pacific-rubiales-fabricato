The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 12:06 p.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index rose 0.4 percent to 13,259.74, while the
Colcap Index gained 0.3 percent to 1,614.96.  Almacenes Exito SA (EXITO)  , Colombia’s biggest retailer,
rose 2.8 percent to 23,100 pesos. The company said it began
offering 2.5 trillion pesos ($1.4 billion) of shares at 21,900
pesos each yesterday in a sale that will end Sept. 23, according
to an e-mailed statement.  French supermarket operator Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA
plans to buy shares proportional to its 55 percent stake in
Exito. Pension funds that hold about a quarter of shares and
current shareholders with preferential rights may also seek to
maintain their stake, driving up demand for the shares ahead of
the offering, said Jairo Agudelo, an analyst at Celfin Capital.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE)  , the Toronto-based
oil producer that operates fields in  Colombia , rose 0.9 percent
to 43,620 pesos. Investors may be betting the stock’s 2.4
percent decline yesterday on falling oil prices was overdone,
said  Andres Jimenez , head of international sales at Interbolsa
SA, Colombia’s biggest brokerage.  Fabricato SA (FABRI CB), Colombia’s biggest textile maker,
rose 2.1 percent to 72 pesos. The Medellin-based company won an
$11 million contract to produce apparel for the Chilean
military, interim Chief Executive Officer Juan Carlos Cadavid
told Caracol radio yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
