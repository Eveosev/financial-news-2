Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd.,  South
Africa â€™s state-owned electricity utility, lost about 200
megawatts of generating capacity after a transformer failed at
its Grootvlei power station.  The availability of spare parts will determine how long it
takes Eskom to bring the unit back on stream, spokeswoman Hilary
Joffe said by mobile phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
