Evotec AG (EVT)  rose the most in more than
two years in Frankfurt trading after selling rights on the
experimental Alzheimer’s treatment EVT 302 to  Roche Holding AG. (ROG)   Evotec gained as much as 18 percent, and traded up 31
cents, or 17 percent, to 2.15 euros as of 9:06 a.m.  The German drug research company will get an initial $10
million from Roche and potentially $820 million if development
and sales goals are met under the terms of the deal announced
late yesterday. Evotec raised its sales forecast for the year as
a result of the payment.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
