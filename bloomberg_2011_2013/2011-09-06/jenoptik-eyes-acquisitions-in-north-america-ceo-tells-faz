Jenoptik AG (JEN)  is in talks with unnamed
companies about possible acquisitions in  North America ,
 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported, citing Chief Executive
Officer Michael Mertin.  The company is aiming to agree “at least one deal” this
year in laser technology, optics and the traffic-safety
business, the newspaper said, citing Mertin.  The company may spend a “triple-digit” million-euro
amount on acquisitions which could help boost annual revenue to
as much as 800 million euros ($1.1 billion) over the medium term
from currently about 500 million euros, Mertin said, according
to FAZ.  To contact the reporter on this story:
