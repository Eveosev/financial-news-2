The Belarusian central bank urged
the country’s commercial banks to review their lending practices
and avoid imposing an “excessive debt-servicing burden” on
retail clients.  Banks were asked to cap rate increases on outstanding
loans, keeping monthly installments including interest payments
below 50 percent of a borrower’s monthly household income, the
 Natsionalnyi Bank Respubliki Belarus  said in a  statement  on its
website today.  The regulator recommended that banks apply an “individual
approach” when revising rates on loans, taking into account
clients’ ability to pay and giving special consideration to
borrowers including mothers of three children or more, war
veterans and pensioners, according to the statement.  Belarus last month raised its refinancing rate for the
eighth time this year, increasing borrowing costs by 5
percentage points to 27 percent, the highest benchmark rate
among 50 countries tracked by Bloomberg. The former Soviet
republic is struggling with a balance-of-payments crisis that
forced a 36 percent devaluation of its ruble in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
