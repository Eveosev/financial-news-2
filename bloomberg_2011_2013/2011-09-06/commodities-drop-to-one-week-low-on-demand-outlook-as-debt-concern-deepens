Commodities fell to the lowest level
in more than a week on deepening concern the European sovereign
debt crisis may further slow global economic growth, damping
demand for raw materials. Gold fell from a record in  London 
after the Swiss central bank set a minimum exchange rate.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index dropped as much as 2.1
percent to 647.88, the lowest intraday level since Aug. 26, and
was down 2 percent at 648.46 by 1:58 p.m. in London. Crude oil
fell as much as 3.8 percent in New York. The S&P index has
retreated 3.1 percent in the second half, as manufacturing
activity slowed in the U.S.,  Europe  and  Asia .  “Commodity markets remain beset by concerns over global
growth and the risks of sliding into another recession, with the
situation made worse by the lack of any solution to Europe’s
sovereign debt crisis,”  Kevin Norrish , an analyst at  Barclays
Capital  in London, wrote today in a report.  Corn, wheat and soybeans fell in  Chicago  on concern demand
is set to wane as Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis worsens,
denting the outlook for the global economy. December-delivery
corn dropped 5.75 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $7.5425 a bushel on
the Chicago Board of Trade. Wheat for December delivery slid 9
cents, or 1.2 percent, to $7.665 a bushel. Soybeans for November
delivery fell 17.75 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $14.28 a bushel in
Chicago.  “The Greek debt crisis seems insolvable, and the troubles
on the equity markets should weigh equally on the commodities
sector,” Paris-based farm adviser Agritel said in a daily
online report.  Gold Drops  Gold for immediate delivery gained as much as 1.1 percent
to a record $1,921.15 an ounce, before falling on speculation
the Swiss central bank’s move to impose a ceiling on the franc’s
 exchange rate  will cut demand for the metal as an alternative to
assets including equities. Immediate-delivery gold traded down
0.3 percent at $1,894.80 in London. It fell as much as 2 percent
after the Swiss announcement.  The franc fell the most since the creation of the euro
after the Swiss central bank set a minimum exchange rate against
the 17-nation currency. European stocks declined a third day,
while U.S. stock futures retreated.  Coffee’s Losing Streak  Coffee fell for a sixth day, the longest losing streak
since July in London, on expectations of a record crop in
 Vietnam  and increasing supplies from  Latin America . Robusta
coffee for November delivery slid $26, or 1.2 percent, to $2,168
a ton on NYSE Liffe in London. Arabica coffee for December
delivery fell 8.35 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $2.797 a pound on
ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  Crude oil for October delivery was down 3.1 percent at
$83.81 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , after
dropping to as low as $83.20 earlier today.  Chief Executive Officer Josef Ackermann of Deutsche Bank AG
said yesterday market conditions reminded him of the financial
crisis in late 2008. The collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. in September of 2008 froze credit markets and forced
taxpayer-funded bailouts of banks from Washington and London to
Berlin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
