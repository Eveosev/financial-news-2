The euro region should revamp the
European Financial Stability Facility to allow the fund to focus
on stabilizing the currency area’s banking system, Oxford
University economist Clemens Fuest told  Handelsblatt  newspaper.  The primary aim of helping  Greece , Ireland and  Portugal  is
to avert a banking and financial crisis similar to that
occurring in 2008, Fuest is cited as saying in an interview. As
banks struggle in the sovereign debt crisis, bolstering their
stability should become the focus of the EFSF’s activities
rather than lending to states, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
