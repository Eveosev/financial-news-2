Arion Bank hf , the state-created
successor to Iceland’s failed Kaupthing Bank hf, reported a 29
percent increase in profit after tax for the first half of the
year.  Profit by that measure rose to 10.2 billion kronur ($88.3
million) in the period through June, from 7.9 billion kronur a
year earlier, the bank said in a statement today. Net interest
income was 11.2 billion kronur, while net commission income
reached 5.1 billion kronur, the Reykjavik-based bank said today
on its  website .  “There’s still a lot of uncertainty in Iceland as in
foreign markets,” Chief Executive Officer Hoskuldur H. Olafsson
said in the statement. “The bank’s financial strength has been
our priority” together with easing client debt burdens, he
said.  Arion’s capital-adequacy ratio was 21.4 percent of its
risk-weighted assets at the end of June, the lender said. The
country’s  Financial Supervisory Authority  requires banks to have
a capital buffer of no less than 16 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
