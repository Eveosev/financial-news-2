BlackRock Inc., the world’s biggest
asset manager, hired Mark Taborsky from Pacific Investment
Management Co. as a senior portfolio manager for a unit that
caters to pension funds, endowments and foundations.  Taborsky was most recently an executive vice president at
Pimco, where he was responsible for asset allocation,  New York- 
based BlackRock said today in a statement. Taborsky will have
direct oversight of client assets in BlackRock’s U.S. Fiduciary
Management Solutions unit, which runs about $50 billion
globally, the firm said.  Before he joined Pimco in 2008, Taborsky oversaw external
managers at Harvard Management Co., the unit responsible for the
endowment of the Cambridge, Massachusetts school. Harvard’s
endowment shrank a record 30 percent to $26 billion in the year
ended June 30, 2009, after investments plunged 27 percent.  Taborsky will report to Nancy Everett, the former head of
General Motors Co.’s asset management unit, who was hired in
January by BlackRock to head the fiduciary unit. BlackRock
manages $3.66 trillion in assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
