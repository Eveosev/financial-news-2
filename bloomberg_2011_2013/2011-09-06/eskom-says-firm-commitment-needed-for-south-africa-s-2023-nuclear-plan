South Africa needs to make a “firm
commitment” now on building additional nuclear reactors to get
new capacity online in 2023, said Kannan Lakmeeharan, divisional
executive for power utility Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd.’s delivery
unit.  South African plans include 3,200 megawatts of nuclear
capacity coming on stream in 2023 and 2024 and these units
require decisions now, Lakmeeharan said in a speech in
Johannesburg today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
