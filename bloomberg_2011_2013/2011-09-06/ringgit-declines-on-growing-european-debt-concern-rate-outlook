Malaysia’s ringgit was little
changed even as mounting concern Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis
will worsen reduced the likelihood of an interest-rate increase.
Bonds advanced by the most in three months.  The central bank will keep its benchmark overnight rate
unchanged at 3 percent on Sept. 8, according to all 18
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index
posted its biggest two-day drop since March 2009 yesterday as
the fifth election defeat for German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s
party this year and reports of a rift between European leaders
and the International Monetary Fund added to concern that
support for bailing out indebted nations is waning.  “Fears the sovereign-debt crisis in Europe will worsen are
reducing risk appetite,” said Calbert Loh, head of treasury at
Bangkok Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “Speculation of a domestic
rate hike has subsided.”  The ringgit traded at 2.9830 per dollar as of 4:50 p.m. in
Kuala Lumpur, compared with 2.9818 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It earlier reached a one-week low of
2.9895. The currency declined 0.6 percent yesterday, the most in
more than two weeks.  The International Monetary Fund opposes European plans to
force Greece to put up collateral in its second rescue, four
people with direct knowledge of the matter said on Sept. 2. The
use of collateral, a concession to win Finland’s backing for 109
billion euros ($155 billion) of loans pledged by euro leaders in
July, would deny the IMF priority creditor status and violate
Greek bondholders’ rights, said the people, who declined to be
named because the talks are in progress.  Malaysia’s government bonds gained. The yield on the 4.262
percent notes due September 2016 decreased 10 basis points, or
0.10 percentage point, to 3.30 percent, according to Bursa
Malaysia. That was the biggest decline since June 7.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
