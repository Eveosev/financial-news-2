The number of chief executive
officers cutting profit forecasts fell 38 percent below average
last month, even as the slowing economy pushed valuations to the
lowest level at the start of September since 1985.  A total of 138 companies reduced earnings forecasts in
August, compared with the average of 221 for the same month
since 2000, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. At the same
time, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slumped 5.7 percent,
pushing its price-earnings ratio to 13.3, the data show. The
gauge fell 0.7 percent to 1,165.24 at 4 p.m. in  New York .  For bears, the lowest multiples since March 2009 show
companies will capitulate and lower their estimates, causing the
benchmark index for American equities to fall this month,
historically the worst for U.S. stocks, according to Bloomberg
data since 1928. Bulls say CEOs are the better gauge and that
lower multiples, combined with expectations for 15 percent
earnings growth this quarter, will make stocks irresistible.  “The bulls would say there’s more resilience,” Jeremy Zirin, who helps oversee $774 billion as New York-based chief
U.S. equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas, said
in a phone interview on Sept. 1. “Companies aren’t seeing what
consumers are seeing. The turmoil in markets and the weakness in
some of the data was more of a reflection of policy makers’
inaction or lack of decisiveness both here and in  Europe , rather
than a true reflection of real economic prospects, which are not
great, but also not recessionary.”  Lowe’s, Macy’s  While Lowe’s Cos. cited lower-than-expected sales when
cutting its forecast on Aug. 15,  Macy’s Inc. (M) ,  Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. (WMT)  said revenue is improving and joined 93 other companies in
raising earnings estimates. S&P 500 companies exceeded analyst
projections for 10 straight quarters, including the 17 percent
rise in earnings during the three months ended in June.  Wall Street firms say S&P 500 profits will increase 19
percent for all of 2011 and 12 percent in 2012. Based on next
year’s income estimate of $112.32 a share, the S&P 500 is
trading for 10.5 times earnings, 36 percent below the five-
decade average of 16.4 times results from the prior year, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Based on reported profits, the index
trades at 12.8, down from 13.3 on Aug. 31 and the lowest level
at the start of September since 1985.  U.S. stocks fell last week as a 2.5 percent drop on Sept. 2
wiped out the S&P 500’s weekly advance after the Labor
Department said American employers added no jobs in August. The
index had surged 7.2 percent between Aug. 19 and Sept. 1, the
most over the same amount of time since September 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Budget Debate  The index has fallen four straight months as  job creation 
slowed, reports on manufacturing and the housing market trailed
forecasts, Europe’s debt crisis worsened and the debate between
President  Barack Obama  and Congress over the  budget deficit 
spurred S&P to strip the U.S. of its AAA credit rating.  “I just don’t see a single piece of data that’s come out
that makes me want to argue there’s a reason to get positive on
the inflection point of earnings,”  Hayes Miller , who helps
oversee $52 billion as head of North America asset allocation at
Baring Asset Management Inc., said in a Sept. 1 phone interview
from Boston. “Downgrades will be the order of the day.”  Analyst earnings estimates have slowed after forecasts rose
for almost two years, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
outlook for profits to rise 19 percent in 2011 compares with an
estimate at this date last year for 2010 profits to climb about
35 percent.  Sell in May  Lowe’s, the second-largest U.S. home-improvement retailer,
was among the 138 companies that cut estimates last month. The
Mooresville, North Carolina-based company said Aug. 15 that
profit in fiscal 2011 will be $1.48 to $1.54 a share, less than
the previous projection of $1.56 to $1.64, after sales fell 0.3
percent at stores open more than a year. Lowe’s had expected a 2
percent rise in those stores’ sales. The new 2011 forecast was
below analysts’ $1.61 a share, Bloomberg data show.  “The macro environment has changed dramatically over the
past several weeks,” Chief Financial Officer Robert Hull said
in an Aug. 15 conference call with analysts. “We went from
worrying about the customer who was stretched by fuel and other
inflation to a nation watching the debt-ceiling countdown and
now to extremely volatile equity markets.”  The  S&P 500  tumbled 9.4 percent from the end of May through
August, the ninth-biggest decrease for the three-month period
since 1928. Investors returning from summer vacations now face
the start of the most volatile period of the year.  Biggest Swings  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known
as the VIX, has posted its biggest two-month swings in September
and October, averaging a 26 percentage point change, compared
with the average of 18 percentage points, according to data
dating back to 1990.  The S&P 500 has declined 1.1 percent on average in
September since 1928. It’s one of three months in which stocks
have fallen, with the next-closest a 0.2 percent loss in
February. Since the  bull market  began in March 2009, September
has produced the biggest gains, averaging 6.2 percent.  “August was not a pretty month for the market,” Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer for BNY Mellon Wealth
Management in  Boston , said in a telephone interview on Sept. 1.
The firm oversees $171 billion. “There’s an awful lot of bad
news priced in. Even at our more conservative outlook for
corporate earnings, we find the market very attractively valued.
CEOs are corroborating this by not guiding us lower.”  Macy’s, Wal-Mart  Macy’s, the second-biggest U.S. department-store chain,
beat earnings estimates on Aug. 10 and raised its full-year
forecast. The Cincinnati-based company announced earlier in
August that same-store sales exceeded projections. Macy’s was 23
percent cheaper than the S&P 500 at the end of August, based on
price-earnings ratios, Bloomberg data show.  Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, boosted its profit
projections for this year a week later, saying the Sam’s Club
wholesale chain helped the company halt a decline in U.S. sales.
Earnings and sales for the quarter ended in July beat the
average analyst projection, sending the shares up 3.9 percent on
Aug. 16. Wal-Mart stock gained 0.9 percent in August, compared
with the 5.7 percent loss in the S&P 500.  “You’re not buying U.S. GDP when you’re investing in the
equity market,” Charles Reinhard, who helps oversee $1.7
trillion as the New York-based deputy chief investment officer
at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC, said in a telephone
interview on Sept. 1. “Companies have demonstrated an ability
to generate profits despite lackluster growth.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
