Vietnam’s bonds advanced, pushing
yields to a six-week low, as demand for sovereign debt was
bolstered after banks started cutting interest rates to comply
with a central bank request. The dong was stable.  Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam, the
country’s second-largest lender, will join other banks to reduce
its commercial lending rates to below 20 percent from today, it
said in a statement yesterday. The State Bank of Vietnam aims to
lower dong lending rates to 17 percent to 19 percent from mid-
September, Governor Nguyen Van Binh said last month.  The yield on the five-year bond fell four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 12.46 percent, according to a daily
fixing price from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That was the
lowest level since July 22.  “Investors expect bond yields to drop as banks are
lowering interest rates on the central bank’s recent request,”
said Do Thi Lan Anh, a fixed-income dealer at  Vietnam
Technological and Commercial Joint-Stock Bank  in Hanoi.  The dong was little changed at 20,827 per dollar as of 5:43
p.m. in Hanoi, according to bank data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank set the reference rate at 20,628 today, unchanged
from Aug. 24, according to its website.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. Editors: Andrew Janes, Anil Varma  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
