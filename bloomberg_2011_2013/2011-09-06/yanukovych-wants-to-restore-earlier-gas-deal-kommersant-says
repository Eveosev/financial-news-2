Ukraine  wants to return to a
previous agreement with Russia which stipulates annual revisions
of gas supply terms,  Kommersant-Ukraine  reported, citing
interview with President  Viktor Yanukovych .  The 10-year contract signed between state companies NAK
Naftogaz Ukrainy and OAO Gazprom in 2009 is unfair, as Ukraine
pays extra for imports and gets a low transit fee, Yanukovych
told Kommersant. Ukraine pays an excess of $5 billion to $6
billion a year, the newspaper reported, citing the president.  Should Russian side not change its position in talks,
Ukraine will turn to international arbitration to prove that
previous government-level agreements were violated, Kommersant
cited Yanukovych as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
