The Bovespa index advanced the most
in three weeks after a measure of U.S. service industries rose
more than forecast and  Brazil ’s inflation in August accelerated
at a pace that was in line with economists’ expectations.  The benchmark equity gauge gained 2.9 percent to 56,607.30
at the close of trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time. That was the
steepest increase since Aug. 11. Sixty-six stocks rose on the
index, while two declined. The real weakened 0.8 percent to
1.6581 per  U.S. dollar . The stock exchange will be closed
tomorrow for a national holiday.  The U.S. Institute for Supply Management’s index of non-
manufacturing businesses increased to 53.3 in August from 52.7 a
month earlier. A reading above 50 signals expansion and the
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of economists called
for a reading of 51.  “The ISM report came in better than expected, and everyone
was looking forward to these figures as the latest economic data
from the U.S. wasn’t so good,”  Felipe Casotti , who helps manage
1.2 billion reais ($723 million) at Maxima Asset Management,
said in a telephone interview from  Rio de Janeiro .  Prices in Brazil, as measured by the benchmark IPCA index,
rose 0.37 percent in August from the previous month, pushing the
annual rate to 7.23 percent, the national statistics agency said
today. The median estimate of 40 analysts in a Bloomberg survey
was for a 0.36 percent increase in August.  Selic Rate  Brazil’s central bank cut the benchmark Selic rate a half
point to 12 percent on Aug. 31 after having raised the rate at
each of its past five meetings.  Homebuilders and retailers jumped, with the MSCI
Brazil/Consumer Discretionary Index posting the steepest advance
among 10 industry groups, gaining 4 percent as traders increased
bets for lower borrowing costs in Brazil. Brookfield
Incorporacoes SA, Brazil’s fourth-largest homebuilder by
revenue, rose 6.4 percent to 6.98 reais, the most in one week.  Lojas Renner SA  rose 5.8 percent to 60.50 reais after
Brazil’s biggest publicly-traded clothing retailer was raised to
“outperform” from “market perform” at Bradesco Corretora.  The yield on the interest-rate futures contracts due in
January 2015 fell eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point,
to 11.08 percent.  Financial stocks advanced after Banco BTG Pactual SA said
shares’ “recent poor performance is a good opportunity,”
according to a note to clients by analysts Marcelo Henriques and
Eduardo Rosman.  Bank Stocks  Banco Bradesco SA rose 3.8 percent to 29.15 reais. Banco do
Brasil SA gained 1.6 percent to 27.12 reais. Itau Unibanco
Holding SA advanced 1.8 percent to 29.31 reais. All three
lenders were given “buy” recommendations in new coverage at
BTG Pactual.  The Bovespa entered a  bear market  on July 27 after plunging
20 percent from its bull-market peak in November. The measure
has since extended that drop to 22 percent.  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge trades at 9.3 times
analysts’ earnings estimates, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That compares to a ratio of 11.4 for the Shanghai
Composite Index, 5.7 for  Russia ’s Micex and 14.1 for  India ’s
Sensex.  Traders moved 6.27 billion reais ($3.78 billion) in stocks
in Sao Paulo today, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That
compares to a daily average this year of 6.56 billion reais
through Aug. 1, according to data from the exchange.  To contact the reporters on this story:
