Chilean students reversed an earlier
decision and will go ahead with nationwide demonstrations on
Sept. 8 to push for improvements to the education system, El
Mercurio  reported , citing protest leader Camila Vallejo.  Vallejo yesterday said students wouldnâ€™t hold
demonstrations out of respect for the victims of a Sept. 2
airplane accident that killed 21 people, the Santiago-based
newspaper reported on its website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
