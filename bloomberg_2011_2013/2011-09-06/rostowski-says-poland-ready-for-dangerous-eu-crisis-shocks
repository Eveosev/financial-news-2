Poland ’s economy is “entering a
dangerous period” in which it may encounter external shocks
from Europe’s debt crisis, Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski said
in an interview with broadcaster  TVP Info  late yesterday.  “I’m not an optimist,” Rostowski said about the debt
crisis. “The size of the shocks, particularly those from the
euro area, depend on whether and what kind of mistakes are made
by the euro-area governments, the  European Central Bank  and the
European Commission.”  Poland is better prepared for market turmoil than it was in
2009 and is “on track” to trim its budget deficit to 3 percent
of gross domestic product next year, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
