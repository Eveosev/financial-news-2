Airbus SAS has won 1,156 orders so
far this year, outselling rival  Boeing Co. (BA)  and putting the
planemaker on track to capture its highest annual intake
following the introduction of the A320neo.  The Toulouse, France-based company pulled in a net 1,015
orders after cancellations during the first eight months, it
said today in a statement. That includes 918 neos, a version of
Airbus’s single-aisle plane with more fuel-efficient engines.  Since introducing the re-engined A320 in December, Airbus
has won more than 1,200 commitments for the plane. If the
company secures firm orders for the outstanding 300 commitments,
it will approach the 2007 record of 1,458 orders.  The planemaker this year has delivered 334 planes so far,
including 264 single aisle planes, 57 widebodies, and 13 A380s.
Airbus, a unit of European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co.,  is
aiming to deliver about 530 planes this year, including about 25
of its double-decker A380s.  Boeing so far this year has won 472 gross orders through
Aug. 30, and 370 net orders, according to information on the
Chicago-based company’s website. Delivery figures were available
only through the end of July, at 260 planes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
