Two German trade groups backed
Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s effort to keep the euro area intact
and praised the European Central Bank’s role in stemming the
debt crisis.  The currency union needs a “fresh start” in which budget
discipline, constitutional debt limits and more economic-policy
coordination carry the day, the heads of the German Chamber of
Commerce and Industry, or DIHK, and the ZDH skilled trades
association said in a commentary published in Die Welt  today .  Trying to expel countries from the currency union is too
simple a demand, DIHK president Hans Heinrich Driftmann and ZDH
head Otto Kentzler said in the newspaper. The ECB has “steered
 Europe  safely through the financial-market crisis,” they wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
