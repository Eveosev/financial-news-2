Comedian Eddie Murphy was named to
host the 84th Academy Awards, as Oscar organizers chose a
successful film and television comic after viewer losses in the
previous telecast.  Producers Brett Ratner and Don Mischer announced the
appointment of Murphy, 50, star of films including “Norbit”
and the Oscar-winning “Dreamgirls,” in a statement today.  The audience for the yearly telecast waxes and wanes with
the popularity of films. At the 2010 show, 41.7 million viewers
watched to see if  James Cameron ’s “Avatar” would win best
picture. “The Hurt Locker” ultimately captured the award.  The Oscars telecast is scheduled for Feb. 26, 2012, on  Walt
Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ABC network. The show is typically one of the most-
watched U.S. TV events, after the  Super Bowl  and the National
Football League playoffs.  The February 2011 telecast, hosted by actors  Anne Hathaway 
and  James Franco , posted a 9.1 percent drop in viewers,
according to Nielsen data. Top honors for 2010 films, including
best picture and best actor, went to “The King’s Speech.”  Murphy, a former stand-up comic, transitioned to movies,
including the “Beverly Hills Cops” films, in the 1980s after
joining the cast of television’s “Saturday Night Live.” He is
featured in “Tower Heist,” a Ratner-directed comedy scheduled
for release on Nov. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
