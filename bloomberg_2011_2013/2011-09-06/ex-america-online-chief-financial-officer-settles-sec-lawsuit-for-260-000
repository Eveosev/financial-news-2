Former  AOL Inc. (AOL)  finance chief John
Michael Kelly agreed to pay $260,000 to settle a Securities and
Exchange Commission suit claiming he helped overstate Internet
ad revenue at the company.  The SEC sued eight former AOL executives in 2008, including
Kelly and another former chief financial officer, Joseph Ripp,
claiming they helped inflate revenue at the company by more than
$1 billion from 2000 to 2002.  In a judgment signed by U.S. District Judge  Colleen McMahon 
in Manhattan today, Kelly agreed to turn over $200,000 in
profits he allegedly made from the scheme and pay a $60,000
penalty. Kelly didnâ€™t admit or deny the allegations in agreeing
to settle.  AOL agreed in 2005 to pay $300 million to settle a related
investigation.  The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Kelly,
08-CV-4612, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
