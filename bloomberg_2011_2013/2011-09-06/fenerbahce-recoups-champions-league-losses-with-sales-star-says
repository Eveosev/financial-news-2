Fenerbahce, the Turkish soccer
league champions banned from  Europe ’s  Champions League  while
under investigation for match-fixing, has nearly recouped
anticipated losses from the ban by selling five key players,
 Star  reported.  The transfer of Nigerian forward Emmanuel Emenike,
Uruguayan stopper Diego Lugano, Brazilian defender Andre Santos,
Spanish striker Daniel Guiza and Senegalese forward Mamadou
Niang earned the team 31 million euros ($44 million), the
newspaper said.  The figure approaches the 40 million euros the team would
lose from the ban, including the players’ salaries and match
bonuses, Star said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
