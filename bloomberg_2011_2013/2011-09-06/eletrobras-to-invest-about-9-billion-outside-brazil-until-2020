Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) ,
Latin America’s largest publicly traded utility, said it expects
to invest 9 billion reais ($5.4 billion) outside of Brazil
through 2020.  Eletrobras, as the company is known, will invest $1 billion
reais a year over the next nine years to expand in Latin
America, Africa and  Asia , a press official, who cannot be named
under corporate policy, said in a telephone interview today. The
Rio de Janeiro-based company’s investments are double what it
spent this year, Chief Executive Officer Jose da Costa Carvalho
Neto said May 18.  Eletrobras is also considering buying a 20 percent stake in
EDP-Energia de Portugal SA from the Portuguese government, Chief
Financial Officer Armando Casado de Araujo, said Aug. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
