Budapest Stock Exchange shareholders
approved the introduction a new trading platform beginning in
2012, after five of  Hungary ’s biggest brokers opposed an
immediate shift to the Xetra platform.  Under the plan, the bourse will adopt whatever trading
system that will be used jointly by NYSE Euronext and  Deutsche
Boerse  AG after their merger is completed. The Budapest bourse’s
majority owner, Vienna-based CEE Stock Exchange Group, had
proposed an quick decision to adopt Deutsche Boerse’s Xetra
platform, which brokers including Concorde Ertekpapir Zrt.
rejected this week.  “The trading system replacement project shall start in
January 2012,” the bourse said in an e-mailed statement, adding
that owners voted unanimously in favor of the resolution. “The
new trading system will be the joint new trading system of
Deutsche Boerse-NYSE/Euronext.”  Mihaly Patai resigned as chairman of the Budapest Stock
Exchange, citing increased duties during “a tense situation”
as the bourse debates the introduction of a new trading
platform, Patai said in an e-mailed statement earlier today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
