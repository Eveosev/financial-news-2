Societe Generale  SA said Ted Ake,
former head of U.S. Treasury and agency trading, has left the
firm after helping it become one of the 20 primary dealers that
trade government securities with the  Federal Reserve .  “Ted stayed on to help with transition until Sept. 1, when
he left to pursue other interests,” James Galvin, a New York-
based spokesman at Societe Generale,  France ’s second largest
bank, said today in an e-mail. He declined to comment further.
Ake, who joined the bank in November 2009 after leaving Mizuho
Financial Group Inc., couldn’t immediately be reached.  Societe Generale hired Alan Mittleman as head of global
U.S. dollar rates trading and Jeffry Feigenwinter to head U.S.
Treasury trading in June. Paris-based Societe Generale has also
been expanding its U.S. foreign-exchange operation while
building up its U.S. fixed-income business. The firm was named a
primary dealer in February.  To contact the reporters on this story:
