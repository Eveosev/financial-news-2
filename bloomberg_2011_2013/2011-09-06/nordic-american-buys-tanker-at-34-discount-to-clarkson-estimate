Nordic American Tankers Ltd. bought
a suezmax vessel built in 1999 for $24.5 million, 34 percent
less than the estimated value for similar ships from Clarkson
Research Services Ltd.  The vessel’s name was undisclosed by Nordic American in a
Market News statement today. Ten-year-old suezmaxes with 150,000
deadweight tons of capacity cost $37 million as of Sept. 2,
according to data from Clarkson, a unit of the world’s biggest
shipbroker.  “We are surprised to see such a rapid drop,” Erik Nikolai Stavseth, an analyst at Arctic Securities ASA, said by phone
from Oslo. “It could potentially reflect the real market
level.”  The crude-oil tanker was built in the same year and at the
same shipyard as sister vessel Nordic Sprite, the statement
showed. The ship was probably the Hellespont Trust, and the sale
price may be just a guideline because only three suezmaxes have
been sold so far this year, Stavseth said earlier today in an e-
mailed report.  A suezmax can haul 1 million barrels of oil. The vessels
are the largest tankers that can navigate the  Suez Canal  while
fully laden.  To contact the reporter on this story:
