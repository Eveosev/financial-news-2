Iran  says the value of its  gold
reserves  stands at about $39 billion, the state-run  Mehr  news
agency reported, citing Central Bank Governor Mahmoud Bahmani.  Iran previously withdrew $13 billion of its deposits in
foreign banks, switching it into gold to prevent its foreign
currency reserves being frozen amid sanctions over the countryâ€™s
nuclear program, Bahmani said in the report published late
yesterday.  The Central Bank bought the gold at a price of $656 per
ounce and its price has tripled since, he said.  Iran Central Bank said in October last year that it has
changed some 15 percent of its foreign exchange reserves into
gold and will not need to import the metal for the next ten
years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
