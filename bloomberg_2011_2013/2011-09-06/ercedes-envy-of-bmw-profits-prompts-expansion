Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz plans to
expand its lineup of high-end luxury cars and sport-utility
vehicles in an effort to surpass  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s
record profit.  Mercedes will add variations of its flagship S-Class model
after revamping it in 2013 in a bid to become the segment’s
profit leader, according to two people familiar with matter. The
Stuttgart, Germany-based automaker is also considering a
convertible version of the $114,100 CL coupe, they said,
declining to be identified discussing internal plans.  BMW and  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi have grown at more than five
times the pace of Mercedes over the past decade by more rapidly
increasing their offerings. The 125-year-old manufacturer, which
has also dropped to third in profitability, lost the luxury-car
sales lead to BMW in 2005 and slipped behind Audi this year.  “Mercedes has been stagnant compared with Audi and BMW,”
said  Juergen Pieper , a Bankhaus Metzler analyst in Frankfurt,
who recommends selling Daimler and BMW shares and buying VW
stock. The brand’s struggles to attract younger customers with
sportier products and late expansion into markets like  China 
have slowly eroded its position, he said.  Mercedes also has new SUVs in the works, and the AMG
performance unit may develop more models after the success of
the $189,600 SLS gull-wing supercar, the people said. To
demonstrate that big cars are still viable even as environmental
rules tighten fuel restrictions, Mercedes plans to show a fuel
cell-powered sedan concept at the International Motor Show in
Frankfurt next week, they said.  Model Push  Mercedes will start its push for sales growth in  Frankfurt 
when it also presents the next generation of the B-Class. The
van-like compact is the first in a line of four small cars aimed
at attracting younger drivers. Mercedes is investing 1.4 billion
euros ($2 billion) to produce the models, including a new
factory in  Hungary . While those models are key to increasing
overall deliveries, the high-end push is needed to boost profit.  “We don’t plan to grow just in premium compact cars,”
Joachim Schmidt, head of sales and marketing at Mercedes, said
in an interview, declining to provide additional details. “We
also have ideas about new products for the high end.”  Mercedes has typically been the leader at the upper end of
the luxury-car market, which is crucial to its image and bottom
line. Last year, the manufacturer delivered 80,000 vehicles from
the S-Class line, including the CL coupe and SL roadster,
beating the 65,800 7-Series cars sold by BMW and the 17,000 A8s
by Audi, according to company figures.  Higher Prices  That sales success, combined with an exclusive reputation,
helps command higher prices. In the U.S., the entry-level S-
Class is a $91,850 hybrid that combines a 3.5-liter engine with
an electric motor, while BMW’s base 7-Series goes for $71,000
and has a standard 3.0-liter engine. Audi’s A8 comes with 4.2-
liter engine and starts at $78,050.  The strong position in luxury sedans hasn’t been enough to
keep Daimler from falling behind BMW and Audi, who’ve been
quicker to move into growing segments like compact SUVs. Between
2001 and 2010, Mercedes increased overall annual sales by 64,000
vehicles, while BMW added 343,600 and Audi 368,400, according to
company figures.  Through the first seven months of 2011, Mercedes has
delivered 48,000 fewer vehicles than Audi and 87,700 less than
the BMW brand.  “Mercedes wants to provide its customers ‘the best or
nothing,’ and we also have to live up to that in terms of our
performance against competitors,” Schmidt said. “That goes for
volume as well.”  Lagging Profit  In addition to slow sales growth, profitability has lagged.
In the second quarter, Daimler’s car unit, which also sells the
Smart city car and the ultra-luxury Maybach brand, posted
earnings before interest and taxes equivalent to 10.7 percent of
revenue, while Audi reported a margin of 11.8 percent and BMW
14.4 percent.  “Mercedes made the mistake of riding its established
customers too long,” said  Stefan Bratzel , director of the
Center of Automotive Management at the University of Applied
Sciences in  Bergisch Gladbach , Germany. “Mercedes needs to go
on the attack because BMW and Audi have been more dynamic.
Otherwise, they risk being left behind.”  Mercedes still has room to expand its big-car offerings,
with potential to grow as wealth in China increases and luxury
spending in the U.S. recovers, said Bratzel, a former manager at
Daimler’s Smart unit.  Tighter Competition  Audi and BMW aren’t standing still. Audi will debut hybrid
and “S” performance versions of the A6 and A8 sedans as well
as the S7 four-door coupe in Frankfurt, as it seeks to move more
upscale and overtake BMW as the luxury-car leader by 2015. This
year, the VW unit, based in Ingolstadt,  Germany , introduced the
Q3 compact SUV to challenge the BMW X1 for suburban drivers -- a
segment where Mercedes is currently absent.  BMW, which will showcase new generations of the 1-Series
compact and 6-Series coupe in Frankfurt, plans to introduce the
electric-powered i3 city car in 2013. The plug-in hybrid i8,
which accelerates to 100 kilometers (62 miles) per hour in 4.6
seconds while getting more than 78 miles per gallon, will follow
in 2014 and cost more than 100,000 euros.  Neither Mercedes nor Audi are likely to surpass BMW in the
next four years, according to IHS Automotive. The Munich-based
carmaker is due to deliver 1.81 million BMW brand vehicles in
2015, compared with Audi’s 1.62 million and Mercedes’ 1.65
million, IHS estimates. For Mercedes, the race won’t end then.  “In the long run, we can’t be content with a solid second
or even third place,” Chief Executive Officer Dieter Zetsche
said in a July memo to employees obtained by Bloomberg. “We
should be far ahead of the pack.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
