Gold shares may rise after the Swiss
central bank set a minimum exchange rate for its currency, a
rival to gold as an investor haven,  Collins Stewart  Plc said.  “The move effectively pegs the Swiss Franc against the
euro and now removes one of gold’s competitors as a safe haven
asset,” Collins Stewart said in a note today. “This further
strengthens the buying case for gold and in particular gold
equities that have underperformed the commodity in the last
year,” it said, citing African Barrick Gold Plc and  Centamin
Egypt Ltd. (CEY)  as the cheapest among U.K.-based gold miners.  The franc surged to records as investors sought protection
against a worsening debt crisis in  Europe . The Swiss National
Bank set an exchange rate of 1.20 to the euro, snapping four
days of gains for the franc and pushing the currency down as
much as 9.9 percent to the weakest level since July.  Gold shares have failed to match gains in bullion prices.  The benchmark Philadelphia Gold & Silver Index of companies
including Barrick Gold Corp. and Newmont Mining Corp. has slid
1.7 percent this year compared with a 33 percent jump in gold.
The metal reached a record $1,921.15 an ounce today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
