The rate that London-based banks say
they can borrow at in Swiss francs for three months rose to
0.00500 percent from yesterday’s record low 0.00333 percent, the
British Bankers’ Association said.  That’s the first daily increase the Libor rate since July
4, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Citigroup Inc. was
the only lender among a panel of twelve contributors to submit a
rate below zero, unchanged at negative 0.02 percent, BBA data
show.  The Swiss National Bank lowered its target for three-month
franc Libor to “as close to zero as possible” on Aug. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
