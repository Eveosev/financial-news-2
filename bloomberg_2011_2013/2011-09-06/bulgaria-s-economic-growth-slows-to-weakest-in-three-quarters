Bulgaria’s economic recovery slowed
to the weakest in three quarters from April through June,
mirroring easing growth across European Union amid euro-area’s
debt crisis.  Second-quarter gross domestic product growth slowed to 2
percent from 3.3 percent in the previous three months and
compared with 1.9 percent growth in the preliminary estimate
published on Aug. 12, the Sofia-based statistics institute said
today on its website. Seasonally-adjusted GDP advanced 0.3
percent in the quarter.  Bulgaria is emerging from its first recession in more than
a decade after a three-year lending expansion stalled and
foreign investment dried up during the global credit crisis. The
EU’s poorest country by per-capita GDP is counting on foreign
demand for its metals, machinery, textiles and furniture to help
drive economic recovery.  Exports, which are equivalent to about two thirds of GDP
and include car-parts producers such as Melexis NV and Montupet,
fell 0.5 percent in the second quarter after a 4.6 percent
increase in the previous three months, the statistics office
said.  Growth in the euro region slowed to 0.2 percent in the
second quarter from 0.8 percent in the first three months of
2011 as governments cut spending to rein in budget deficits.
 Germany ’s economy, the region’s largest, almost ground to a
halt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
