Indonesia’s rupiah dropped for a
second day as the worsening debt crisis in  Europe  sapped demand
for emerging-market assets.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of regional stocks fell to its
lowest level in two weeks as an election loss for German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s party fueled concern that support for
bailing out indebted European nations is waning.  Bank Indonesia 
will keep its benchmark  interest rate  at 6.75 percent on Sept. 8,
according to all eight economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  “The main issue is Europe’s debt crisis, which is
weakening Asian currencies including the rupiah,” said Jakarta-
based Lindawati Susanto, head of treasury at PT Bank Resona
Perdania. “Stock markets in the region are weak.”  The rupiah slipped 0.3 percent to 8,564 against the dollar
as of 3:25 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The decline will be limited as inflation remained
near the lowest level in more than a year, indicating
 Indonesia ’s economic fundamentals are strong, said Susanto.  Government data yesterday showed consumer prices rose 4.79
percent in August from a year earlier, compared with 4.61
percent in July, which was the least since May 2010.  The yield on the 8.25 percent government bonds due July
2021 declined three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to
6.82 percent from yesterday’s close, according to midday prices
from the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
