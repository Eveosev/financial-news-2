M.Video, a Russian electronics
retailer, rose for a third day after Vedomosti reported Czech
private equity group PPF Group NV may acquire a controlling
stake in the company.  The shares climbed as much as 4 percent and traded up 0.9
percent at 223.96 rubles by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow.  PPF, which boosted its control in Moscow-based retail chain
Eldorado Group to 100 percent last month, plans to sell it to
M.Video and gain a controlling stake in the unified company, the
Russian newspaper reported, citing unidentified people with
knowledge of the talks.  The report could “create strong speculative support for
M.Video shares,” UralSib Financial Corp. analyst Tigran Hovhannisyan wrote in an e-mailed report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
