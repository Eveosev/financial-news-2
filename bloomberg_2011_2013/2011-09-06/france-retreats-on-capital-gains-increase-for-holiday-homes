The French government watered down
an austerity package, saying that second homes held for more
than 30 years won’t be subject to  capital gains  taxes,  France 
Info reported, citing unidentified members of parliament.  An increase in capital gains on holiday residences was part
of a 12 billion-euro ($17 billion) package proposed last month
to bring down the government’s budget deficit. The measure was
particularly opposed by members of parliament from the south of
France, which has many second homes, the radio station said.  To compensate for the lost revenue, the government may
increase levies on luxury hotels or abolish a tax break that
allows companies to deduct losses on overseas subsidiaries from
their French taxes, France Info said.  The government earlier this week backtracked on plans to
raise the value added tax on theme park admissions after
opposition from local governments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
