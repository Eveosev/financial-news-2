Western Canada Select’s discount
narrowed to the smallest margin in nearly 21 months as
 ConocoPhillips (COP)  nears the startup of a new unit at its Wood River
refinery in  Illinois  that will process more heavy crude.  A new coker is expected to start in the  fourth quarter  that
will help boost the amount of heavy oil the plant can process by
130,000 barrels a day, according to a March 23 presentation to
analysts.  “More refiners want to grab hold of Western Canada Select
as they keep their runs high,” said  Andy Lipow , president of
Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Western Canada Select’s discount to West Texas Intermediate
narrowed $3.65 to $7.60 a barrel at 1:59 p.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the smallest gap
for the heavy oil since January 2010.  The premium for Syncrude widened $1.80 to $11.80 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in  Alberta .  Heavy Louisiana Sweet added $1.50 to $32 a barrel over WTI,
while Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium increased $1 to $29.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend added $1.75 to $27.25 while Poseidon strengthened $2.30 to
$27.60 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium added $1 to $26 a barrel.
West Texas Sour’s discount widened 5 cents to 75 cents. Thunder
Horse’s premium added $2 to $29 above the benchmark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
