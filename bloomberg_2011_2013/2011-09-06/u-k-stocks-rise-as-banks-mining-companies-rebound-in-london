U.K. stocks advanced for the first
time in three days as shares of  Whitbread Plc (WTB)  and  Fresnillo Plc (FRES) 
rallied.  Whitbread paced advancing shares after reporting an
acceleration in sales growth. Fresnillo advanced 3.9 percent.
Barclays Plc and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  limited gains
in the benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX) , falling more than 2 percent.  The FTSE 100 Index gained 54.26, or 1.1 percent, to
5,156.84 at the 5:30 p.m. close in  London , after tumbling 5.8
percent over the previous two trading days amid concern that
global growth is slowing as  Europe ’s debt crisis spreads. The
 FTSE All-Share Index (ASX)  gained 0.9 percent today, while Ireland’s
ISEQ Index was little changed.  The FTSE 100 climbed 3.2 percent last week after the August
slump of 7.2 percent dragged equities to their cheapest
valuation on estimated earnings since March 2009. The gauge has
still fallen 15 percent from this year’s high in February.  “I don’t think anything has changed in terms of
sentiment,” said  Richard Hunter , head of U.K. equities at
Hargreaves Lansdown Plc in London. “Investors are concentrating
on the debt situation again. Until we get at least some sort of
concrete strategy and plan on the table, volatility and
fragility will remain.”  Whitbread surged 7.3 percent to 1,563 pence after the
company said second-quarter revenue at outlets open at least a
year rose 4.8 percent in the 11 weeks to Aug. 18, led by
stronger performances at its Premier Inn budget hotels and Costa
Coffee shops. That compared with growth of 1.7 percent in the
previous quarter.  Fresnillo, Randgold Rise  Fresnillo climbed 3.9 percent to 2,064 pence as Numis
Securities Ltd. raised its recommendation for the silver
producer to “hold” from “reduce.” Randgold Resources Plc
also advanced, jumping 3 percent to 6,940 pence. Numis upgraded
the shares to “add” from “hold.”  RBS lost 2.8 percent to 21.17 pence, extending yesterday’s
12 percent slump, while  Barclays Plc (BARC)  dropped 2.2 percent to
150.75 pence.  A gauge of U.K. banks lost 5 percent yesterday as the cost
of insuring against default in Europe surged to a record amid
signs that European lenders may be struggling to get funding.  To contact the reporters on this story:
