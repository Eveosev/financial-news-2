The rate at which London-based banks
say they can borrow for three months in dollars climbed to the
highest level in more than a year, rising for the 30th
consecutive day.  The  London  interbank offered rate, or Libor, for dollar
loans advanced to 0.33561 percent from 0.33278 percent
yesterday, according to the British Bankers’ Association. That’s
the highest level since Aug. 19, 2010, and the longest stretch
of gains since November 2005.  The dollar Libor-OIS spread, a gauge of banks’ reluctance
to lend, was at 25.26 basis points as of 12:04 p.m. in London,
from 24.78 basis points yesterday. That’s the most since Aug. 3,
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
