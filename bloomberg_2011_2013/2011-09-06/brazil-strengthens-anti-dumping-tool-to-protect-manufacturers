Brazil  decided to implement anti-
dumping duties retroactively to prevent companies from stocking
up on imported goods the government says pose a threat to local
industry.  The decision makes good on a promise by President Dilma Rousseff to toughen trade barriers to protect manufacturers hurt
by a currency rally that’s fueling a surge of imports from
 China . Brazil’s real has rallied 40 percent against the  U.S.
dollar  since the end of 2008, more than all 25 emerging market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  As a result of today’s new rules, the government can apply
its anti-dumping tax retroactively 90 days before the a
preliminary ruling on whether the price of the imported product
costs less than it would in its country of origin.  The government added air conditioners and bicycles as well
as five other products to a list of goods subject to higher
tariffs under the Mercosur trade agreement with Argentina,
Uruguay and  Paraguay .  The government also announced that it will charge an anti-
dumping duty of $743 per ton (1231 reais) on a type of steel
tube manufactured in China and used by the oil and gas
industries.  According Foreign Trade Secretary Tatiana Prazeres, the
government has noted increased imports of these kinds of tubes
from China that enter the country underpriced.  “Almost half of the 81 anti-dumping measures taken by
Brazil are against Chinese products,” said Prazeres.  To contact the reporter on this story:
