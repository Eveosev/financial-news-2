Vehicles of army troops loyal to
 Muammar Qaddafi  crossed the border into Niger, as  Al Jazeera 
reported that transitional government forces reached an
agreement for the surrender of his loyalists in Bani Walid.  The convoy entered the Niger city of Agadez late yesterday
and was headed to the capital, Niamey, Salley Kolle, a police
officer, said today by phone. Niger’s Nomade FM radio station
reported yesterday that Qaddafi’s intelligence chief, Mansour
Daw, was in the one of the vehicles.  “They are with Nigerien Tuareg rebels who know the area,”
Kolle said.  Al Jazeera reported yesterday that there may be fewer than
100 Qaddafi loyalists in Bani Walid, which is 90 miles (145
kilometers) southeast of the capital, Tripoli, and one of a
handful of cities still controlled by the old government.  Since rebels took control of Tripoli in late August,
transitional authorities have been trying to restore stability,
consolidate military gains and capture Qaddafi. More than six
months of fighting to end the Libyan leader’s 42-year rule have
reduced oil production and disrupted power supplies in the
country with  Africa ’s largest crude reserves.  Libyan National Transitional Council head Mustafa Abdel Jalil said Sept. 3 forces will pressure the cities of Sirte,
Bani Walid, Jufra and Sabha until they give up, while continuing
to supply them with humanitarian aid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
