A measure of momentum for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index is showing a similar pattern to one
that preceded the previous two bear markets in U.S. stocks and
could presage more losses, according to WJB Capital Group Inc.  For the first time since 2007, the benchmark’s Moving
Average Convergence/Divergence line, calculated by subtracting
the index’s average level during the past 26 months from the
average over the past 12 months, crossed below the “signal
line” that plots the 9-period average difference between the
two, according to Bloomberg data. The 12-month moving average
itself is still rising.  “The only thing that’s missing, to date, from the S&P
repeating the 2000 and 2008 turndowns is a rolling over in its
12-month moving average,”  John Roque, a senior technical
analyst at WJB in New York, wrote in a note to clients today.  The S&P 500 has declined as much as 18 percent from a
three-year high on April 29 amid concern about Europe’s debt
crisis and signs U.S. growth may be slowing. The benchmark gauge
for U.S. stocks surged as much as 102 percent from a 12-year low
in March 2009 as earnings beat analysts’ estimates and the
Federal Reserve bought Treasuries to boost the economy.  The last two times the cross below the signal line occurred
-- December 2007 and April 2000 -- the S&P 500 slumped 54
percent and 47 percent, respectively, before hitting its bottom,
data from Bloomberg show. Roque said the S&P 500 is at risk of
extending losses should the benchmark’s average price during the
past 12 months start falling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
