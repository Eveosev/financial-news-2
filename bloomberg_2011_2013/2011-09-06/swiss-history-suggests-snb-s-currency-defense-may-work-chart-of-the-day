The Swiss central bank should be
able to defend its ceiling on the franc’s exchange rate if the
currency target it imposed in 1978 is any guide, said  Geoffrey Yu , a foreign-exchange strategist at UBS AG.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the  Swiss National Bank 
succeeded in keeping the franc below 80 francs per 100 Deutsche
marks in the two decades through 1998, before  Germany  adopted
the euro. During that period, Swiss inflation exceeded the SNB’s
2 percent limit in 12 years.  The franc surged to a record against the euro last month,
as European governments struggled to contain the region’s debt
crisis. With the strengthening currency hurting exports and
clouding growth prospects, SNB policy makers today set a franc
ceiling of 1.20 versus the euro and said they’re ready to
“enforce this minimum rate with the utmost determination.”  If the 1978 experience “is anything to go by, the SNB
should be successful in defending this level,” Yu said in an e-
mailed note from  London  today. “If in a few quarters’ time, the
euro-franc has managed to retain stability or even some gains,
without Swiss inflation going through the roof, the SNB will be
able to look back and reflect on a job well done.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
