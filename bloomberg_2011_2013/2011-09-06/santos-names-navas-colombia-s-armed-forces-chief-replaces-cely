Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos today replaced Admiral Edgar Cely, commander of
Colombia’s armed forces, with General Alejandro Navas, to help
boost security in the Andean nation, the president’s office said
in an e-mailed  statement .  General Sergio Mantilla was named commander of the army,
General Tito Saul Pinilla will be head of the air force and
Admiral Roberto Garcia Marquez was named head of the navy, the
statement said. General Oscar Naranjo was retained as head of
the police force.  The changes come almost a week after Santos named a new
defense minister, switching Rodrigo Rivera with Juan Carlos Pinzon.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
