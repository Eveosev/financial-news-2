Woolworths Holdings Ltd., a South
African clothing and food retailer, surged to a record on
speculation the company will continue returning cash to
shareholders through share buybacks and higher dividends.  The stock gained as much as 4.2 percent to 38.55 rand, its
highest since the shares started trading in October 1997, and
was 2.5 percent higher at 37.93 rand as of 3:36 p.m. in
Johannesburg. Shares in the company have climbed 18 percent
since Aug. 1, outperforming a 4.3 percent increase in the
FTSE/JSE Africa General Retailers Index.  The company’s final dividend rose 37 percent to 13.5 cents
a share for the year through June and it bought back 275 million
rand ($39 million) of its shares, it said on Aug. 25. Sales of
clothing and footwear climbed 11 percent, compared with market
growth of 9.5 percent, it said in the statement.  “Internally, they are getting things right and from a
market point of view, they are taking market share,” Patrick
Mathidi, a portfolio manager at Momentum Asset Management, said
by phone today. “They are starting to generate a lot of cash,
so there is a decent dividend yield and the share price is
underpinned by a lot of share buybacks.” Woolworths has a
dividend yield of 3.1 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
