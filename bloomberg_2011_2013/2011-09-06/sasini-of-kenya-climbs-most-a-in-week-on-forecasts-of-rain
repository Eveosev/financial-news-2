Sasini Ltd. (STCL) , a Kenyan tea and coffee
producer, rose the most in a week after the weather office
forecast heavy rainfall through mid-September in some of the
country’s key farming areas.  The stock climbed 20 cents, or 1.9 percent, to 10.5
shillings by 10:30 a.m. in Nairobi, the capital.  Downpours are expected in west and central Kenya, sections
of the Rift Valley, and Nairobi over the next two weeks, the
 Daily Nation  newspaper reported today, citing Joseph Mukabana,
director of the  Kenya Meteorological Department .  “Rain is one of the biggest contributors to revenue
growth” for agricultural producers, Wycliffe Masinde, an
analyst at Nairobi-based Kestrel Capital East Africa Ltd., said
by phone today. The increase is attributable to the “good
weather forecast.”  Unseasonably dry weather this year led to a 14 percent
decline in tea production in the seven months through July to
204.8 million kilograms, the Tea Board of  Kenya  said on Aug. 23.  Shipments of  coffee  fell 41 percent in June to 2,676.6
metric tons, the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics said on
Aug. 18.  Kenya is the world’s largest exporter of black tea and a
producer of high-quality and specialty coffee beans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
