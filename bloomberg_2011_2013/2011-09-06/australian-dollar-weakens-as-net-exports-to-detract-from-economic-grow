The Australian dollar weakened,
touching the lowest since Aug. 26, after a government report
showed that net exports will detract from second-quarter gross
domestic product.  The so-called Aussie dropped to $1.0502, and traded at
$1.0514 as of 11:33 a.m. in Sydney, from $1.0526 before the
data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
