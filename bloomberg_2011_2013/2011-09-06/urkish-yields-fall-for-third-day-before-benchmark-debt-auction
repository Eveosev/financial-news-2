Turkish yields fell for a third day
to an eight-month low before the government sells 20-month and
eight-year bonds today.  The yield on two-year benchmark debt declined four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.70 percent at 11:40 a.m.
in Istanbul, a Turk Ekonomi Bankasi index of the securities
showed, heading for the lowest close since Jan. 25. The yield
has fallen 1.17 percentage points since the beginning of August
after the central bank’s unexpected interest-rate cut Aug. 4.  The Treasury is selling lira-denominated debt due in 2013
and 2020 in two of this month’s three auctions and plans to
raise 8.5 billion liras from debt sales in September, the
government said on its  website . Inflation unexpectedly increased
to 6.65 percent in August from 6.3 percent the previous month,
within the central bank’s range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent.  “Inflation stayed within the target band and it is not
creating a problem,” Yagiz Oral, a fixed-income trader at
Denizbank AS in Istanbul, said by telephone. “This is positive
for bonds and we can see the yields falling further in the
coming days.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
