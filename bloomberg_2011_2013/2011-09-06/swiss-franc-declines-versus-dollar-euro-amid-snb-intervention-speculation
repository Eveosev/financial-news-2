The Swiss franc weakened against the
dollar and euro, amid speculation the nation’s central bank will
take measures to curb the currency’s strength after consumer
prices rose at the slowest pace in almost a year.  Switzerland ’s currency snapped four days of gains after the
Swiss National Bank today announced it had foreign-currency
holdings of 253.35 billion francs ($319.7 billion) at the end of
August, up from 182.1 billion francs in the previous month, a
result of measures to weaken the franc. Policy makers have
devalued the franc by as much as 16 percent against the euro
from its Aug. 9 record high by cutting borrowing costs to near
zero and boosting supply in money markets six-fold.  “In terms of permanent firepower the SNB is kind of stuck
unless they launch something new, such as a foreign exchange
floor or a target peg,” said  Geoffrey Yu , a foreign-exchange
strategist at UBS AG in  London . “If euro-zone conditions
continue to deteriorate, and we do think they will continue to
deteriorate, that could prompt some more aggressive action.”  The franc weakened 0.7 percent to 79.28 centimes per dollar
as of 8:41 a.m. in London. It also slid 0.7 percent against the
euro, to 1.1169.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
