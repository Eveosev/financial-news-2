Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) , the world’s
largest defense contractor, sold $2 billion of bonds with
investment-grade corporate debt issuance showing signs of
revival.  Lockheed issued $500 million of 2.125 percent bonds due in
2016 that yield 127 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A $900
million portion of 3.35 percent, 10-year debt pays a spread of
142 basis points and $600 million of 4.85 percent, 30-year
securities pay 167 basis points more than the benchmark. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  Borrowing costs are hovering at about the lowest on record
as Treasury yields decline amid concern that  Europe ’s sovereign
debt crisis may spread at the same time that the  U.S. economy 
slows. Bond sales for investment-grade companies in the U.S. may
reach $80 billion this month, according to Bank of America Corp.
strategists, after plunging to $50.5 billion in August.  Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed may use the proceeds to
repay debt and for general corporate purposes, according to a
filing today with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Enbridge Energy Partners LP (EEP)  also issued $750 million of
debt maturing in 10 and 29 years, Public Service Co. of  New
Hampshire  priced $160 million of notes maturing in 2021 and
Detroit Edison Co. sold $140 million of 30-year bonds, Bloomberg
data show.  Issuance fell 30 percent to $3.98 billion last week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. August’s sales were the
least since May 2010.  Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds fell 14 basis
points to 3.62 percent on average last week after touching 3.45
percent, the lowest in data extending to October 1986, on Aug.
4, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate
Master index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
