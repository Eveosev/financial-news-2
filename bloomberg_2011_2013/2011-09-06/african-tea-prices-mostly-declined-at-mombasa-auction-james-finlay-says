African tea prices mostly declined
at a sale in the Kenyan port city of Mombasa today, James Finlay
(Mombasa) Ltd. said.  “There was good general demand for a total of 110,506
packages on offer,” the broker said in an e-mailed report
today. “Poor quality teas were heavily discounted where sold
but mostly were withdrawn.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
