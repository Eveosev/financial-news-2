Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi
said he will appeal to his Group of Seven counterparts about the
danger the strong yen poses to the economy when he meets them
for the first time in Marseille,  France .  “We’re very concerned about excessive yen gains and I want
to clearly state that we are watching speculative movements with
great interest” at the Sept. 9-10 gathering, Azumi told
reporters in Tokyo today. ”I’m eager to convince them to share
the same view.”  Azumi became Japan’s finance chief last week, succeeding
 Yoshihiko Noda , who is now prime minister. The Japanese currency
rose to a postwar high of 75.95 against dollar on Aug. 19 and it
traded at 76.80 at 11:46 a.m. in Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
