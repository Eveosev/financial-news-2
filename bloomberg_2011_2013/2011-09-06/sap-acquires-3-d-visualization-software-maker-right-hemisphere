SAP AG (SAP) , the largest maker of
business applications software, plans to acquire Right
Hemisphere, which makes three-dimensional diagrams of products
and processes, for an undisclosed amount.  Right Hemisphere, based in  San Ramon ,  California , and
Auckland makes software that lets customers create 3-D models of
product designs, manufacturing processes and assembly
instructions, Walldorf, Germany-based SAP said in a statement
yesterday.  SAP supplies applications that let companies manage their
accounting and reporting procedures, track inventory levels and
plan deliveries. Right Hemisphere’s software would let SAP’s
customers see animated views of products to improve design,
assembly and support, SAP said.  “Right Hemisphere’s product is highly complementary to
SAP’s Business Suite and Business Intelligence offering and will
increase clients’ productivity,” Bernd Laux, an analyst at CA
Cheuvreux who rates SAP shares “underperform,”  wrote in a
note.  SAP rose 2.3 percent to 36.61 euros at 9:17 a.m. in
Frankfurt trading. The stock has dropped 4 percent this year.  On Sept. 2, a U.S. judge in Oakland, California, threw out
a $1.3 billion copyright-infringement verdict against the
company in a case brought by its rival, Oracle Corp. A jury had
awarded the damages to Oracle in November. U.S. District Judge
Phyllis Hamilton ruled that SAP should get a new trial for
damages if Oracle rejects her decision to reduce the amount to
$272 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
