Former  Duane Reade  Inc. Chief
Financial Officer William Tennant was sentenced to three years’
probation for his June 2010 securities fraud conviction.  Tennant, 64, and former Chief Executive Officer Anthony Cuti were tried together on charges they falsely inflated income
and misled investors from 2000 to 2005. Cuti was convicted of
conspiracy and securities fraud and sentenced last month to
three years in prison.  “Please don’t send me to jail,” Tennant said today to
U.S. District Judge  Deborah Batts , who granted his request at a
hearing in federal court in  Manhattan . Tennant told Batts he had
cooperated in the investigation and suffered from the “long,
painful, humbling experience” of the prosecution.  After holding post-trial hearings, the judge found that
prosecutors hadn’t proved any financial loss resulting from
Tennant’s crime.  Duane Reade, founded in 1960, was named after the two Lower
Manhattan streets where it was located, a few blocks from the
federal courthouse. Bain Capital LLC bought the chain from
brothers Abraham, Eli and Jack Cohen in 1992 and sold shares to
the public in 1998. Oak Hill Capital Partners LP bought all the
publicly traded shares in July 2004.  Walgreen Co. (WAG) , the biggest U.S. drugstore chain, agreed to
buy Duane Reade Holdings from affiliates of Oak Hill for $618
million in February 2010.  The case is U.S. v. Cuti, 08-cr-00972, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
