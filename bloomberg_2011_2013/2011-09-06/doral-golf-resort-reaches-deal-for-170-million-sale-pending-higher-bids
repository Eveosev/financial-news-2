The Doral golf resort’s owner agreed
to sell the Miami property for $170 million as part of a
restructuring of a group of luxury resorts.  A joint venture that includes hedge fund Paulson & Co. took
control of eight resort properties including the Doral through a
foreclosure earlier this year. The Doral, which was put into
bankruptcy, was then put up for sale.  The $170 million bid is subject to higher offers at an
auction, according to a Sept. 2 court filing in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Manhattan. Edward Sassower, a lawyer for the resorts,
didn’t return a phone call seeking information about the
identity of the buyer.  The bid doesn’t include the Doral’s White course, one of
five championship-level golf courses at the site, according to
court papers.  The case is In re MSR Resort Golf Course LLC, 11-10372,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
