The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development may lend 45 million euros ($63 million) to
 Serbia ’s state-run power company to help it overhaul and build
hydro plants.  The loan, if implemented, will support a 165.2 million-euro
project to build eight small hydro plants and rebuild another 15
owned and run by Elektroprivreda Srbije, or EPS, the dominant
power producer in Serbia, the lender said on its  website  today.  The project aims to increase EPS’s annual output by 77
gigawatt hours and reduce its  carbon emissions  by 60,000 tons a
year. Two-thirds of EPS’s electricity generation comes from
coal-fired plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
