Paracon Holdings Ltd. (PCN) , a South
African computer-services and recruitment company, rose to the
highest price in two weeks after  Adcorp Holdings Ltd. (ADR)  offered to
buy the company for about 689 million rand ($97 million).  Adcorp dropped after South Africa’s largest diversified
employment-services company said it offered to pay 1.97 rand per
share for Paracon.  Paracon investors can also opt for one Adcorp security for
every 13.812 shares they own or choose a combination of cash and
equity, the Johannesburg-based companies said in a joint
statement today. The cash portion of the deal won’t exceed 265
million rand, the companies said.  Paracon rallied for a second day, adding 2.6 percent to
1.95 rand by 11 a.m. in Johannesburg, the highest since Aug. 22.
The stock, which jumped 4.4 percent yesterday, has declined 4.4
percent since the company said it was in unspecified talks on
July 6. Adcorp, which has retreated 10 percent over the same
period, fell 1.5 percent to 27 rand for a market value of 1.7
billion rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
