ENL Property, a unit of Mauritian
company  ENL Land Ltd. (SAVA) , plans to build an $80 million shopping
mall in Zambia as it expands in sub-Saharan Africa, Chief
Executive Officer Gilbert Espitalier-Noel said.  The 25,000 square-meter (269,000 square-foot) project will
be developed in Lusaka, Zambia’s capital, with South Africa’s
Atterbury Investment Holdings, Espitalier-Noel told reporters
today in Ebene, south of the capital,  Port Louis .  ENL Property’s current developments total 20 billion rupees
($711.7 million), including residential projects and shopping
malls. ENL and Atterbury’s first project is the 3.5 billion-
rupee  Mall of Mauritius at Bagatelle , a 42,000 square-meter
development  due to open on Sept. 29, it said.  The Zambian project is a stepping stone in Africa and part
of the company’s “logical expansion” as it prospects other
sub-Saharan countries such as Tanzania and  Mozambique ,
Espitalier-Noel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
