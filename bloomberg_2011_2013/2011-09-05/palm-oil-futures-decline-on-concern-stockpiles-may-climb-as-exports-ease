Palm oil  declined on concern that
stockpiles in  Malaysia , the second-largest grower, may increase
as exports slow after the end of the festival season.  The November-delivery contract dropped 1.1 percent to 3,018
ringgit ($1,013) per metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange. Futures gained 2.5 percent last week,  the first
increase in six weeks.  Shipments from Malaysia may ease as importers stocked up
ahead of the Muslim festival of Eid, celebrated last week.
Malaysia’s palm oil exports fell 0.6 percent to 1.62 million
tons in August compared with the previous month, independent
market surveyor Intertek said Sept. 2. Shipments dropped 0.5
percent in the month, Societe Generale de Surveillance estimated
on Aug. 29.  “Exports will be lower, as pre-stocking was already done
in July,” Arhnue Tan, senior investment analyst at ECM Libra
Capital Sdn., said by phone from  Kuala Lumpur  today. “The
resulting impact could see stock levels go up. This will be bad
news” for prices, she said.  Stockpiles dropped to 2 million tons in July from 2.05
million tons in June, while exports rose 9.1 percent to a record
1.73 million tons, the Malaysian Palm Oil Board said on Aug. 10.
Production slipped 0.1 percent to 1.75 million tons in July. The
board is scheduled to release output, inventory and shipment
data for August on Sept. 12.  “Exports for August were much lower than industry
expectations,” said Vimala Reddy, an analyst at Karvy Comtrade
Ltd., said by phone from the Indian city of Hyderabad. “Bulk
demand for edible oil is gradually decreasing. The main festive
season has already come to an end.”  Demand would pick up again in a month’s time as the Hindu
Diwali festival is celebrated at the end of October, Reddy said.  Soybean futures for November delivery climbed 11.25 cents,
or 0.8 percent, to $14.4575 a bushel in  Chicago  on Sept. 2,
capping a weekly gain of 1.6 percent, the third straight. All
U.S. markets and government offices are closed today, in
observance of Labor Day.  Palm oil for May delivery on the Dalian Commodity Exchange
shed 0.5 percent to close at 8,996 yuan ($1,408) per ton, while
 soybean oil  for delivery in the same month fell 0.6 percent to
10,426 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
