A trial will start today against the
former Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa and four others
charged with corruption in the procurement of armored vehicles
from  Finland â€™s weapons maker Patria Oyj, Delo newspaper
 reported , citing unidentified court sources in Ljubljana.  Jansa, who was a premier from 2004 to 2008, has repeatedly
denied any wrongdoing, according to the Ljubljana-based
newspaper. He repeated the stance on his Facebook page
yesterday, saying the charges were groundless and lacked
evidence.  Slovenia agreed to buy 135 armored vehicles from the
Finnish weapons maker for 278 million euros ($393 million) in
2006. Jansa, whose party is leading opinions polls and may win
the next election, was first accused of bribery by the Finnish
state-owned TV station YLE in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
