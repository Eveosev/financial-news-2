BP Chief Executive Officer  Robert Dudley  said investors want “clarity and certainty” after
Russian bailiffs raided the Moscow office and  Halliburton Co. (HAL) 
filed suit over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill last year.  The company’s shares dropped to the lowest in more than a
year today. Last week, BP also evacuated workers from Gulf rigs
as Tropical Storm Lee approached, and a judge ruled that victims
of the Macondo leak may seek punitive damages.  “Management and the board are working hard on the firm’s
long-term strategy,” Dudley said in an e-mail to BP employees
obtained by Bloomberg News. “Our objective is always to make
the right decisions for the company and its shareholders, and
not to be overly distracted by short term noise.”  BP declined 3 percent today to 363 pence, the lowest since
July 9, 2010. The stock is now 45 percent lower than it was
before the Gulf spill started on April 20 last year.  “It is the solid day-to-day successes that are vitally
important,” Dudley said. “There will continue to be
challenging headlines, especially as we move towards trial in
the  Gulf of Mexico  litigation next February. Do not be
distracted by this. We have a great team of professionals
working on these issues.”  BP hired  Geoff Morrell  as head of communications of BP
America, Dudley told employees in a separate e-mail. Morrell was
press secretary for the U.S. Department of Defense for four
years and was formerly White House correspondent for ABC News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
