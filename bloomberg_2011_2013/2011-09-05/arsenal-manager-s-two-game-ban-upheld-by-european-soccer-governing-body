Arsenal manager  Arsene Wenger ’s
appeal of a two-match ban failed, and he will miss Champions
League games against  Borussia Dortmund  and Olympiacos this
month, the north London soccer club said.  Wenger was banned from Arsenal’s Champions League play-off
against Udinese because of his comments about a referee during
last season’s tournament. He was given the added suspension
after improperly contacting his assistants during Arsenal’s 1-0
home win over the Italian club on Aug. 16. UEFA, European
soccer’s governing body, rejected his appeal, Arsenal said today
on its website.  “Wenger will now be suspended from carrying out his duties
at Arsenal’s next two UEFA competition matches,” Arsenal said
in the statement.  The team was fined 10,000 euros ($14,100) for the coach’s
actions.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
