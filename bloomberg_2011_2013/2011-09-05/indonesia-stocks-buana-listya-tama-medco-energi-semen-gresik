Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Indonesian trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the 4 p.m. Jakarta-time close.  The Jakarta Composite index rose 24.44 points, or 0.6
percent, to 3,866.17, the first gain in four days. The market
was closed Aug. 29 to Sept. 2 for a public holiday.  PT Benakat Petroleum Energy (BIPI IJ), an  oil company ,
climbed 1 percent to 99 rupiah. Benakat plans to buy a 10
percent stake in freight transportation company PT Buana Listya
Tama this year at a cost of about 300 billion rupiah ($35.1
million), Investor Daily Indonesia reported. Two calls to
Benakat’s office in Jakarta weren’t answered. Buana Corporate
Secretary Kevin Wong couldn’t be reached when called at his
office in Jakarta.  PT Medco Energi Internasional (MEDC IJ), the nation’s
largest listed oil company, declined 2.1 percent to 2,325
rupiah, the lowest close since Aug. 9. Crude oil for October
delivery fell 2.8 percent to $86.45 a barrel in  New York  on
Sept. 2, the biggest drop since Aug. 18. The contract slid 1.8
percent to $84.91 a barrel in after-hours trading.  PT Semen Gresik (SMGR IJ),  Indonesia ’s biggest cement
producer, advanced 2.8 percent to 9,350 rupiah, the highest
close since Aug. 2. Semen Gresik expects to increase output to
23 million metric tons next year from 20.2 million tons this
year, Investor Daily Indonesia reported, citing Dwi Soetjipto,
president director at the company. Soetjipto couldn’t be reached
when called at his office in Gresik, East Java.  PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia (TLKM IJ), the nation’s largest
telephone company, jumped 4.1 percent to 7,550 rupiah, the
biggest increase since March 24. Telkom rose on “bargain
hunting” as the stock’s recent declines bolstered its valuation
appeal, said Syaiful Adrian, an analyst at PT Ciptadana
Sekuritas in Jakarta.  Telkom fell 1.4 percent last month, dragging its valuation
to 12 times earnings, compared with a multiple of 15.8 times for
shares on the  Jakarta Composite index. (JCI)   To contact the reporter on this story:
