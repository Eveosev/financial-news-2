Somali government representatives,
lawmakers and a pro-government militia began talks on drafting a
new constitution and holding elections in the war-torn country.  The discussions, which started yesterday in the capital,
Mogadishu, are the first of a series of meetings aimed at
endorsing a roadmap outlining tasks Somalia’s transitional
administration needs to achieve over the next 12 months, the
United Nations Political Office for Somalia said in an e-mailed
statement.  “Stable government can be achieved through security, good
governance, reconciliation and finalization of the draft
constitution,” Prime Minister Abdiweli Mohamed Ali said at the
start of the conference yesterday.  A Transitional Federal Government was established in
Somalia in 2004, the 14th attempt to create a functioning
central administration since the fall of Mohamed Siad Barre’s
dictatorship in 1991. The mandate of the so-called TFG, which
had been scheduled to end last month, was extended for 12 months
in June.  The meeting, which ends tomorrow, includes representatives
of the TFG, lawmakers, officials from the semi-autonomous
northern state of Puntland, and the Ahlu Sunna Wal Jama’a
militia. Talks will also focus on the current drought that has
caused a famine in some southern regions of the Horn of Africa
country, according to the UN.  To contact the reporter on this story:
