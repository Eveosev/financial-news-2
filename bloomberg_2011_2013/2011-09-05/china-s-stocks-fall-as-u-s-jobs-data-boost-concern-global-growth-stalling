China ’s stocks fell to the lowest
level in almost 14 months as a drop in a Chinese services index
to a record low and a report showing no U.S. jobs growth last
month boosted concerns global economic growth is stalling.  Anhui Conch Cement Co. plunged 10 percent after a
purchasing managers’ index slid to 50.6 in August from 53.5 in
July. PetroChina Co. sank to a record low and Jiangxi Copper Co.
dropped the most in a month after the U.S. unemployment rate
stayed at 9.1 percent last month.  Shenzhen Development Bank Co. (000001) 
slumped after the China Securities Journal said new  reserve
requirements  for 14 listed banks may increase by about 700
billion yuan ($110 billion) over the next six months.  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, lost 49.5 points, or 2 percent, to
2,478.74 at the 3 p.m. close, the lowest level since July 19,
2010. The CSI 300 Index retreated 2.1 percent to 2,743.82.  “China’s tightening policies have hurt economic growth,”
said Zhang Han, a strategist at Guotai Junan Securities Co.
“The U.S. economic slowdown is making investors more
pessimistic, adding to concerns over domestic problems like
inflation. The market will continue to fall in the short term.”  The Shanghai gauge has slumped 12 percent this year as the
central bank raised  interest rates  five times and ordered
lenders to set aside more cash as deposit reserves 12 times
since the start of 2010 to contain inflation. It is valued at
11.4 times estimated earnings, a record low, according to daily
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Economic Slowdown  The August drop in the Chinese services-industry index was
reported by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics in a
statement today. The non-manufacturing purchasing managers index
issued on Sept. 3 by the China Federation of Logistics and
Purchasing dropped to 57.6 in August from 59.6 in July. A number
above 50 indicates expansion.  Anhui Conch, China’s biggest maker of the building
material, slid by the daily limit to 19.72 yuan, the most since
October 2008, on concern slowing investment in housing and
railways will curb demand for building materials. Huaxin Cement
Co. slumped 10 percent to 20.50 yuan.  Investors should brace “for more pain” amid manufacturing
growth slowing globally and prospects that Chinese monetary
policies will loosen any time soon fade, according to China
International Capital Corp.  China’s August manufacturing data was one of the lowest
since the global economic recovery, while factory output in
 South Korea ,  Taiwan ,  France ,  Italy , the UK and Sweden all
slumped, Hao Hong, a global strategist at CICC, wrote in a
report today.  U.S. Jobs  PetroChina, the biggest  oil company , sank 1.7 percent to
9.60 yuan, the lowest since its listing in November 2007.  China
Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028)  lost 2.1 percent to 7.06 yuan. China
Shenhua Energy Co., the largest coal producer, slumped 3.2
percent to 25.63 yuan. Jiangxi Copper, the biggest copper
producer, slid 2.9 percent to 31.46 yuan, the most since Aug. 8.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index tumbled 2.5 percent on
Sept. 2 after government data showed U.S. payrolls were
unchanged in August, the weakest reading since September 2010.
The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey called for an
increase of 68,000.  Europe ’s debt crisis is also worsening as
Italy backtracked on austerity pledges,  Finland  and its partners
wrangled over Greek collateral and  Germany  curbed the power of a
rescue fund.  Crude for October delivery in  New York  fell as much as 1.9
percent to $84.82 a barrel in electronic trading. The contract
dropped 2.8 percent on Sept. 2.  Tight Liquidity  China’s money-market rate surged the most in more than two
weeks. The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, rose 68 basis points to 4.89 percent as of
3:11 p.m. in  Shanghai , according to a weighted average rate
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center. That was the
biggest increase since July 20.  Gauges of financial and industrial stocks in the CSI 300
Index extended last week’s slumps of more than 3 percent after
the central bank issued an order on Aug. 26 to lenders they will
have to include margin deposits in calculations of their reserve
requirements from today.  The new requirement rules will have larger effects on Bank
of Communications Co., Shenzhen Development Bank, Bank of
Nanjing Co., Huaxia Bank Co. and China Minsheng Banking Corp.,
the China Securities Journal said, citing its own calculations.
The banks may have to readjust their asset structures on tighter
liquidity in the inter-bank market, it said.  Bank of Communications lost 1.5 percent to 4.66 yuan.
Shenzhen  Development Bank  retreated 2.8 percent to 16.45 yuan.
China Minsheng slid 0.9 percent to 5.81 yuan.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
