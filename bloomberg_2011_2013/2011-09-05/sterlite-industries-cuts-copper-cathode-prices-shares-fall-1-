Sterlite Industries ( India ) Ltd.,
the nation’s biggest copper producer, cut prices for the first
time in three months on expectation of slowing global demand and
following a decline in prices on the London Metal Exchange.  The unit of  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  reduced prices by 4.6
percent to 445,409 rupees ($9,700) a metric ton, effective Sept.
1, according to a statement posted today on the company’s
website. Shares of Sterlite, which sets prices each month based
on the average London Metal Exchange price the previous month,
slumped to the lowest in more than two weeks.  Copper averaged 3.9 percent lower at $9,275 a ton in
August on the LME. Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank AG last
month cut the estimate for  China ’s gross domestic product growth
in 2012 to 8.7 percent and 8.9 percent respectively, citing the
effects of weaker growth in the U.S. and  Europe . China and the
U.S. are the top copper consumers.  “Both Europe and U.S. have problems, which have started to
affect copper prices,” said Basant Vaid, a senior analyst at
Bonanza Commodity Brokers Ltd. in Mumbai. “Even though the
supplies are less than demand at present, a slowdown in the West
may lead to a drop in demand and reduce the mismatch.”  Tuticorin, Tamil Nadu-based Sterlite dropped as much as 2.7
percent to 130.45 rupees, the most since Aug. 18, and traded at
131.30 rupees as of 10:46 a.m. in Mumbai. The benchmark
Sensitive Index fell 1.1 percent.  Falling Prices  Three-month copper fell as much as 0.5 percent to $9,030 a
ton in  London  and traded at $9,041.75 a ton by 1:19 p.m.
Singapore time. It rose as much as 0.4 percent earlier.  The U.S. Labor Department on Sept. 2 reported the weakest
payrolls reading since September 2010. The Conference Board’s
index of  consumer confidence  in the world’s second-largest
copper user, slumped to 44.5, the weakest since April 2009.  It was the largest point drop since October 2008, falling
from a revised 59.2 reading in July, figures from the New York-
based research group showed Aug. 30. A separate report showed
 home prices  declined for a ninth month.  Industrial production in Japan rose less than expected in
July, signaling that the nation’s recovery from the March 11
earthquake and tsunami is losing momentum as the yen gains and
overseas demand slows. In  South Korea , industrial output
expanded at the slowest pace in 10 months as weakness in global
growth threatens the outlook for exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
