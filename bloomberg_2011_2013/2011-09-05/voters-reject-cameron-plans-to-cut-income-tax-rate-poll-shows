Most British voters are opposed to
Prime Minister  David Cameron â€™s plan to scrap the 50 percent
income  tax rate  for high earners, according to an opinion poll.  A survey by ComRes Ltd. showed 57 percent of respondents
are against plans to abolish the tax rate that apply to earnings
above 150,000 pounds ($241,470) a year once the government has
eliminated the  budget deficit  by 2015. The plan was rejected by
67 percent of supporters of the Liberal Democrats, the junior
partners in the coalition government.  The poll showed 71 percent backed LibDem plans to penalize
the wealthy more with higher property taxes. While voters
rejected the plans on grounds of fairness, 56 percent said
removing the top rate would encourage entrepreneurs to stay in
the U.K.  ComRes surveyed 1,000 adults by phone on Sept. 2-4.  To contact the reporters on this story:
