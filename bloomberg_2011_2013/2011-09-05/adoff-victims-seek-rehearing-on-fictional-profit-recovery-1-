Investors in Bernard Madoff’s former
firm asked a U.S. appeals court to review its ruling barring
them from recovering money lost in the  Ponzi scheme .  A federal appeals court in  New York  said Aug. 16 that the
liquidator of the con man’s firm can ignore fictitious profits
on money Madoff never invested when calculating losses and who
is entitled to be repaid. The investors asked for a “rehearing”
by the full court, saying the Second Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled differently in an earlier case.  “Reconsideration of the decision by the full court is
necessary to maintain uniformity of the court’s decisions,”
attorneys for the investors said in a Sept. 3 filing.  In a 2004 case involving New Times Securities Services
Inc., the court “accepted the position” that customers who
lose money in a Ponzi scheme are entitled to insurance payments
based on their account statements, “including appreciation in
the value of securities never actually purchased for them,” the
investors said in the filing.  Amanda Remus, a spokeswoman for Madoff trustee  Irving Picard , didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment
on the U.S. Labor Day holiday.  Madoff, 73, is in a federal prison in  North Carolina ,
serving a 150-year sentence for the fraud.  The case is: In re Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities
LLC, 10-2378, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
