Diageo Plc (DGE) , the world’s biggest
liquor maker, submitted the highest bid for Ethiopia’s state-
owned Meta Abo Brewery, the Addis Fortune reported.  Diageo offered $225 million, SABMiller Plc with SouthWest
Development bid $190 million, and Amsterdam-based  Heineken NV (HEIA) 
offered $188 million, the Addis Ababa-based newspaper said,
citing the Privatization and Public Enterprise Supervising
Agency.  Meta is the third-largest brewer in Ethiopia with a 15
percent market share, Addis Fortune said. It will be the last
brewery to be sold to private investors following the sales of
Bedele and Harar breweries to Heineken in May, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
