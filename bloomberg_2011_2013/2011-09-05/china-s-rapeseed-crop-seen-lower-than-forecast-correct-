China ’s rapeseed crop may be below
10 million metric tons, much lower than a government estimate,
said Fei Zhonghai, deputy manager of Cofco Oils Co.  “We reckon rapeseed oil futures traded on the Zhengzhou
Commodity Exchange have limited downside at current prices due
to lower production and the possibility of government purchases
for stockpiling,” said Fei, who was speaking at a forum in
Zhengzhou.  China’s 2011 rapeseed output was 12.64 million tons, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported Aug. 26 in a flash
headline, citing the National Development and Reform Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
