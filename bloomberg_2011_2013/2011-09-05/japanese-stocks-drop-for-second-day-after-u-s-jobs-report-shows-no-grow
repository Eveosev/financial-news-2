Japanese stocks fell the most in two
weeks after a report showed U.S. employment stagnated, stoking
concern the world’s biggest economy may slip into a recession
and damping the earnings outlook for Asian exporters.  Honda Motor Co., a carmaker that gets 44 percent of its
revenue in  North America , dropped 4.7 percent.  Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s largest lender, dropped 2.3
percent after banks fell in the U.S.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , the world’s
No. 2 maker of construction equipment, fell 5.4 percent after
Citigroup Global Markets Japan Inc. lowered its rating on the
stock to “hold” from “buy,” citing a drop in its share of
the Chinese market amid competition with local manufacturers.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average fell 1.9 percent to 8,784.46
as of the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo, the biggest drop since Aug. 19.
The broader Topix index declined 1.8 percent to 755.82.  “Jobs related to personal spending have been lost, showing
U.S. domestic demand is very weak,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , who
helps oversee the equivalent of $24 billion as chief strategist
at Toyota Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “Stocks are falling
broadly, especially export-related equities.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.8
percent today. In  New York , the index fell 2.5 percent to
1,173.97 on Sept. 2 after a report showed U.S. payrolls were
unchanged in August, the weakest reading since September 2010.
The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey called for an
increase of 68,000. U.S. markets will be closed today for a
public holiday.  Topix Performance  The Topix has lost about 16 percent this year as concerns
about an economic slowdown in the U.S. and  Europe ’s debt crisis
damped demand in two of  Japan ’s biggest export markets. The
decline has cut the price of shares on the index to 0.89 times
book value, the lowest since March 2009. Gross dividend yields
on the index were 2.44 percent, near the highest since April
2009.  “U.S. jobs numbers were pretty bad with data for June and
July being revised downward,” said  Masahiko Sato , an analyst at
Nomura Holdings Inc. “Japanese stocks are relatively cheap when
you look at valuations such as price-to-book ratio and dividend
yields. But they are not being bought due to uncertainty in the
U.S. and Europe.”  Exporters fell with Honda contributing the most to the
Topix’s decline. Honda dropped 4.7 percent to 2,389 yen, and
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , Japan’s biggest carmaker, slid 2.6 percent
to 2,640 yen, the lowest since 2003. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group dropped 2.3 percent to 334 yen, while  Canon Inc. (7751) , the
world’s biggest camera maker, declined 2.5 percent to 3,505 yen.  Fed’s Tools  The  S&P 500  slid as much as 18 percent from a three-year
high on April 29 amid concern the  U.S. economy  was weakening.
Stocks rebounded at the end of August as Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said in an Aug. 26 speech in Jackson
Hole, Wyoming, that the central bank has tools to stimulate
growth without signaling he will use them. He echoed comments
from dissenting members of the  Federal Open Market Committee  who
said economic reports aren’t pointing to a recession.  Komatsu fell 5.4 percent to 1,973 yen after Citigroup
Global Markets Japan Inc. lowered its rating on the stock to
“hold” from “buy,” citing a drop in its share of the Chinese
market amid competition with local manufacturers. Hitachi
Construction Machinery Co. also slid 5.4 percent to 1,396 yen
after Citigroup cut its stock price estimate to 1,600 yen from
1,750 yen.  Fast Retailing Co.,  Asia ’s biggest apparel chain, dropped
1.7 percent to 13,900 yen after it said same-store sales at its
Uniqlo casual clothing stores in Japan dropped 9.4 percent in
August from a year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
