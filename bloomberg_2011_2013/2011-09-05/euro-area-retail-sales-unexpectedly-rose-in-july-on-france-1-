European retail sales unexpectedly
rose in July as French and Portuguese households stepped up
spending, helping to compensate for stalling revenue in  Germany .  Sales in the 17-nation euro region advanced 0.2 percent
from June, when they rose 0.7 percent, the European Union’s
statistics office in Luxembourg said today. Economists had
projected stalling sales, the median of 23 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey showed. Sales declined 0.2 percent in the
year after dropping 0.7 percent in June.  European retailers may struggle to boost their sales growth
as governments toughen spending cuts to narrow budget gaps,
discouraging consumer demand. European economic confidence
slumped in August as households grew more pessimistic about the
outlook.  Carrefour SA (CA) , the world’s second-largest retailer, on
Aug. 31 cut its full-year profit forecast.  The euro was little changed after the data were released,
trading at $1.4145 at 11:05 a.m. in Brussels, down 0.4 percent
on the day.  In Germany,  Europe ’s largest economy, retail sales remained
unchanged from June. French sales advanced 0.6 percent and
Ireland reported a 0.3 percent increase. In Spain, sales held
steady, while in  Portugal  they jumped 2.5 percent.  The statistics office didn’t provide figures for Italy,
Greece and the Netherlands. Greece, Ireland and Portugal have
all received external aid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
