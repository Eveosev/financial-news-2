(Corrects 2010 assets under management in last paragraph.)  Switzerland ’s lenders will find it
difficult to buoy their profitability this year because of lower
client trading activity and a surging currency, the head of the
country’s banking association said.  “This year’s market environment and the strong Swiss franc
means” banks will have a “hard time defending profitability,”
Swiss Bankers Association Chairman Patrick Odier told reporters
today in Zurich.  Profit from commission and services may fall for a second
consecutive year in 2011, according to a report by the SBA.  Total net income at the Alpine country’s banks quadrupled
to 10.6 billion francs ($13.5 billion) in 2010, helped by income
from the interest margin business and the trading business of
the nation’s biggest lenders, the association’s survey of 311 of
the country’s banks showed.  Swiss banks had 5.47 trillion francs of managed assets at
the end of 2010, the report said.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
