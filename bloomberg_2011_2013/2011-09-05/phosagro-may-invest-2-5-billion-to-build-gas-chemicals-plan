(Corrects headline, first, second paragraph to say
Phosagro may join $2.5 billion project as one of several
investors.)  OAO Phosagro, a Russian fertilizer
maker, may join a $2.5 billion project to build a complex to
process natural gas into soil nutrients and plastics, Chief
Executive Officer Maxim Volkov said.  The company, which owns fertilizer plants in Cherepovets,
northwestern  Russia , would be one of several investors in the
project, which will need an additional 2 billion cubic meters of
gas a year from OAO Gazprom, Russia’s biggest gas producer,
Volkov said told reporters today at a United Russia conference
in the city. Gazprom’s North European pipeline passes through
the region.  Phosagro plans to process heavy fractions of gas that are
being wasted, Volkov said. This may be done in cooperation with
petrochemicals producer OAO Sibur Holding, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
