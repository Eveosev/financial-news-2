Ukraineâ€™s government will keep the
hryvnia stable and seek to keep its budget gap, including
Naftogaz Ukraine, at 3 percent of gross domestic product,
Premier  Mykola Azarov  said.  The  International Monetary Fund  will probably visit the
country in mid-October, Azarov told reporters today in Kiev. The
country will probably exports about 20 million tons of grain
this year and get $4 billion in revenue from the exports of the
commodity, he said.  The country will divide Naftogaz and set up a gas
extraction company capable of handling up to 1 trillion cubic
meters of gas potential, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
