EnQuest Plc (ENQ) , a North Sea oil
company, fell the most in five months in London trading after
saying that “production uncertainty” at two wells near the
Shetland Islands will cut full-year output.  EnQuest retreated 11.15 pence, or 10 percent, to 96.55
pence, the sharpest drop since March 23. The stock has fallen 31
percent this year, valuing the London-based explorer at 775
million pounds ($1.3 billion).  Average production for 2011 will be 23,000 to 24,500
barrels of oil equivalent a day, compared with a previous target
of 26,500 barrels a day. Production at the S7 well in the Conrie
field and well S8Z in the Don Southwest field was lower than
expected, EnQuest said in a Sept. 2 statement  Output in the first half climbed to 25,210 barrels of oil
equivalent a day from 18,708 a year earlier, EnQuest said Aug.
12. Chief Executive Officer Amjad Bseisu, who took charge when
the company started as a spinoff from Petrofac Plc and  Lundin
Petroleum AB (LUPE)  in 2010, has increased EnQuest’s stakes in existing
blocks and added to reserves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
