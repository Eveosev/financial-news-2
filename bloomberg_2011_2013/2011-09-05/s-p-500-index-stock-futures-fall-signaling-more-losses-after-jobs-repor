U.S. stocks fell, giving the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index its longest slump in almost a month,
amid concern that Europe’s debt crisis is worsening. Equities
pared losses in the final 30 minutes of trading.  The benchmark measure trimmed its drop from 2.9 percent as
companies most-tied to economic growth rebounded, propelling the
Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index to a 0.2 percent gain for the day.
 Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  decreased more
than 3.4 percent on concern about a global financial crisis.
 Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  lost at least 1.3 percent on
speculation that demand for commodities will slow.  The S&P 500 lost 0.7 percent to 1,165.24 at 4 p.m. in  New
York . The benchmark gauge has fallen 4.4 percent in three days,
the longest drop since Aug. 8. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
slumped 100.96 points, or 0.9 percent, to 11,139.30 today.  “The big worry is the situation in Europe,”  John Carey , a
Boston-based  money manager  at Pioneer Investments, said in a
telephone interview. The firm oversees about $250 billion.
“Until we have some resolution of that crisis, we’re going to
have continued turbulence in the market. I still think the
chance of a recession is less than 50 percent. However, there’s
the risk that sentiment just turns so negative that people crawl
back into their holes and we do have another downturn.”  The U.S. stock market was closed yesterday for a holiday,
as global equities fell, Italian bonds dropped for an 11th day
and the cost of government and bank default insurance rose to
records amid concern about  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Trimming Losses  Benchmark gauges trimmed losses in the final minutes of
trading as investors, including  Mark Bronzo , who helps manage
$26 billion at Security Global Investors in Irvington, New York,
cited “short covering” after the selloff. “The markets were
hit hard and we will get some news from Europe and also hear
from President Obama,” he wrote in an e-mail.  A stagnant labor market and bleaker business and consumer
sentiment may require more effort from President Barack Obama
and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke to spur growth.
Obama has requested a joint session of Congress on Sept. 8 for
an address to unveil his proposals to promote job growth. In a
letter to House Speaker John Boehner, Obama said that the nation
faces “unprecedented” economic challenges.  The MSCI All-Country World Index fell a fourth day. The
franc weakened the most since the creation of the euro after the
Swiss central bank imposed a ceiling on the franc for the first
time in more than three decades and pledged to defend the target
with the “utmost determination.”  Lower Forecasts  HSBC Holdings Plc cut its forecast for global economic
growth for the next two years and said the efficacy of any
further stimulus measures will be limited. The world economy
will grow 2.6 percent this year and 2.8 percent in 2012,
compared with estimates published in June of 3 percent and 3.4
percent respectively, London-based HSBC economists including
Stephen King and Madhur Jha said in a note to clients today.  “Healthy economic recovery is now but a distant dream,”
they wrote. “For the developed world, the downgrades are
particularly aggressive whereas, for the emerging world, the
reductions are more modest, helped by the ongoing support
offered by China and India.”  Stocks pared losses earlier today after the Institute for
Supply Management’s index of non-manufacturing businesses
increased to 53.3 in August from 52.7 a month earlier, beating
the median 51 projection by economists in a Bloomberg News
survey. A reading above 50 signals expansion. The Tempe,
Arizona-based group’s index averaged 56.1 in the five years to
December 2007, when the last recession began.  Most-Tied  Companies most-tied to economic growth rebounded from the
lows of the session.  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  lost 2.9 percent to
$23.63, after falling as much as 5.9 percent.  General Electric
Co. (GE)  decreased 3.2 percent to $15.25, paring an earlier drop of
4.8 percent.  Bank of America declined 3.6 percent to $6.99, while
JPMorgan lost 3.4 percent to $33.44. The two lenders were among
17 banks sued by the U.S. to recoup $196 billion spent on
mortgage-backed securities bought by  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac .
The Federal Housing Finance Agency, on behalf of Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac, filed 17 lawsuits on Sept. 2 in New York state and
federal courts and in federal court in Connecticut.  U.S. government-backed firms and agencies should “stop
punishing banks” and suspend demands for mortgage repurchases
because they are impeding an economic recovery, according to
 Paul Miller  of FBR Capital Markets & Co. Repurchase losses may
total $121 billion, wrote Miller, a former federal bank
examiner, in a note to clients dated today. He previously said
the tally might range from $54 billion to $106 billion.  Commodity Producers  Gauges of energy and raw-material producers in the S&P 500
fell at least 0.6 percent as the S&P GSCI index of 24
commodities lost 0.5 percent. Exxon slid 1.4 percent to $71.15.
Alcoa decreased 2.2 percent to $11.77.  Temple-Inland Inc. (TIN)  rallied 25 percent to $30.85.
 International Paper Co. (IP) , the world’s largest pulp and paper
maker, said it agreed to acquire the Austin, Texas-based company
for $3.7 billion, ending a three-month battle for control of the
shipping-box manufacturer.  A measure of momentum for the S&P 500 is showing a similar
pattern to one that preceded the previous two bear markets in
U.S. stocks and could presage more losses, according to WJB
Capital Group Inc.  ‘Signal Line’  For the first time since 2007, the benchmark’s Moving
Average Convergence/Divergence line, calculated by subtracting
the index’s average level during the past 26 months from the
average over the past 12 months, crossed below the “signal
line” that plots the 9-period average difference between the
two, according to Bloomberg data. The 12-month moving average
itself is still rising.  “The only thing that’s missing, to date, from the S&P
repeating the 2000 and 2008 turndowns is a rolling over in its
12-month moving average,” John Roque, a senior technical
analyst at WJB in New York, wrote in a note to clients today.  The last two times the cross below the signal line occurred
-- December 2007 and April 2000 -- the  S&P 500  slumped 54
percent and 47 percent, respectively, before hitting its bottom,
Bloomberg data show. Roque said the S&P 500 is at risk of
extending losses should the benchmark’s average price during the
past 12 months start falling.  UBS AG cut its year-end forecast for the S&P 500 and
estimates for earnings in 2011 and 2012 on concern the global
economy is weakening. The index will climb 15 percent from its
closing level on Sept. 2 to 1,350 at the end of the year, down
from an earlier prediction of 1,425, according to Chief U.S.
Market Strategist  Jonathan Golub .  Earnings Estimates  Thomas Doerflinger, also a strategist at the firm, lowered
his estimates for combined profit by companies in the benchmark
equity index to $95 a share in 2011 from $99.35 and to $101 a
share in 2012 from $108.  Bearish bets by investors using futures contracts on the
 S&P 500 Index (SPX)  increased to the highest level in almost four
years in the week ended Aug. 30, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Short
selling involves the sale of securities borrowed from the owner,
and generates profit when the trader repurchases them at a lower
price and returns them to the owner.  Hedge funds and other large speculators hold a net 107,913
futures contracts wagering that the S&P 500 will decrease in
value. The short position is the highest since September 2007,
when bearish bets reached a record of 127,474 contracts a month
before the benchmark equity gauge reached an all-time high,
according to Bloomberg data going back to 1997.  To contact the reporter on this story:
