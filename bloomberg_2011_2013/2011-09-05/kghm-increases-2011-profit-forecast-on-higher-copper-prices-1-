KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH) , Polandâ€™s sole
copper and silver producer, increased its profit forecast for
this year by 16 percent as it benefits from higher prices of the
metals and increased output.  The state-controlled producer expects net income of 9.64
billion zloty ($3.2 billion) this year on sales of 18.9 billion
zloty, the company said in a regulatory statement today.  KGHM increased its forecast for the average annual copper
price by 10 percent to $9,000 a ton from the $8,200 it predicted
in January. Copper for three-month delivery slid $129, or 1.4
percent, to $8,947 a metric ton at 1:28 p.m. on the London Metal
Exchange.  The company, based in Lubin, southwest  Poland , expects to
produce 570,000 tons of electrolytic copper, five percent more
than it planned early this year. Silver output is to reach 1,144
tons, compared with an earlier forecast of 1,027 tons.  KGHM plans capital expenditure at 10.8 billion zloty this
year, raising its target by 19 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
