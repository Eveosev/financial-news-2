McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) , the world’s
largest restaurant operator, will begin listing calorie counts
on menus in the U.K. starting this week, part of a government
initiative to tackle the health risks associated with obesity.  “People will now be able to see at a glance how many
calories are in their burger, salad, Happy Meal or milkshake,”
the U.K.’s Department of Health said in a  statement  today. The
calorie counts will start appearing Sept. 7, it said.  Oak Brook , Illinois-based McDonald’s, which has about 1,200
stores in the U.K., has been trying to lure more health-
conscious customers with fruit smoothies and oatmeal.  Starbucks
Corp. (SBUX)  and Burger King Holdings Inc. also signed the government’s
labeling  pledge , which requires restaurants to list calorie
content for food and non-alcoholic drinks.  In July, McDonald’s said it would start putting apple
slices and smaller packets of fries in all of its Happy Meals in
the U.S. this year. The change reduces calories in kids’ meals
by 20 percent, the company said.  McDonald’s, which generates about 60 percent of its revenue
outside the U.S., has almost 33,000 stores worldwide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
