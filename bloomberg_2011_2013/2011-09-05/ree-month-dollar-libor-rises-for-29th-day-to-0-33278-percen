The rate at which London-based banks
say they can borrow for three months in dollars rose to the
highest in more than a year after climbing for a 29th
consecutive day.  The  London  interbank offered rate, or Libor, for dollar
loans climbed to 0.33278 percent from 0.33056 percent at the end
of last week, according to the British Bankers’ Association.
That’s the highest since Aug. 19, 2010, and the longest stretch
of gains since November 2005.  The dollar Libor-OIS spread, a gauge of banks’ reluctance
to lend, was at 24.68 basis points as of 11:45 a.m. in London,
the most since Aug. 3, 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
