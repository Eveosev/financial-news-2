The  European Central Bank  bought
Italian government bonds today, according to three people with
knowledge of the transactions.  The ECB was buying small amounts, said one of the people,
who asked not to be identified because the deals are
confidential. A spokesman for the Frankfurt-based central bank
declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
