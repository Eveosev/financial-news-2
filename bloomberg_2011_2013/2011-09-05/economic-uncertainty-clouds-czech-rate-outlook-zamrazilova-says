The Czech economy is facing high
uncertainty that is clouding the outlook for  interest rates ,
central bank board member  Eva Zamrazilova  said.  Interest rates should rise this year in the absence of “a
correction” in food-price growth and if there is a risk of
inflation exceeding forecasts, Zamrazilova, who had voted for
higher interest rates for a year, said in an interview with
magazine Euro posted on the central bank’s website today.  Policy makers in Prague have expressed differing views on
inflation risks as they debate when to start raising interest
rates from a record low. Zamrazilova was one of the two board
members who demanded a quarter-point increase in the two-week
repurchase rate from 0.75 percent on Aug. 4. The other five
policy makers voted to keep stable borrowing costs.  “I have long held the view that extremely low interest
rates are a short-term solution for an economy during the time
of crisis,” Zamrazilova was quoted as saying in the interview.
“The fact is that we are facing such high uncertainty at
present that I can’t say how I will see the situation at the
next monetary policy meeting” scheduled for Sept. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
