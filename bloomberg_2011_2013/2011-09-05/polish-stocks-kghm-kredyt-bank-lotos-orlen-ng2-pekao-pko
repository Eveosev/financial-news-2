Poland ’s WIG20 Index fell for a
third day, losing 74.94, or 3.2 percent, to 2,284.81 at 3:46
p.m. in Warsaw.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO PW), Poland’s biggest bank, slid
1.88 zloty, or 5.4 percent, to 32.66 zloty.  Bank Pekao SA (PEO)  , majority-owned by UniCredit SpA, declined 7.6 zloty, or 5.4
percent, to 134.5 zloty and  Getin Holding SA (GTN)  , the
financial-services group controlled by billionaire Leszek
Czarnecki, retreated 0.39 zloty, or 4.5 percent, to 8.26 zloty.  The zloty extended its longest losing streak against the
Swiss franc in a month, fueling speculation lenders in Poland
will face defaults on foreign-currency mortgages. Franc-
denominated mortgages totaled 162.2 billion zloty ($55 billion)
in July, accounting for 54 percent of all home loans in Poland,
according to the country’s financial regulator.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , Poland’s sole copper
producer, dropped 2.5 zloty, or 1.5 percent, to 162.4 zloty,
heading for the lowest close in more than a week. Copper fell to
the lowest price in more than a week on concern slumping
economies may reduce demand.  Kredyt Bank SA (KRB)  , the Polish lender that Belgium’s
KBC Groep NV plans to sell, sank 1.09 zloty, or 7.6 percent, to
13.31 zloty, heading for the steepest drop in more than two
weeks. OAO Sberbank isn’t in talks on buying Kredyt Bank or Bank
Millennium SA, RIA Novosti reported, citing German Gref, chief
executive officer of  Russia ’s biggest lender. Russian newspaper
Kommersant reported on Aug. 23 that Sberbank is considering
buying the two banks.  NG2 SA (CCC)   lost 0.62 zloty, or 1.4 percent, to 43
zloty, its third day of declines. The Polish shoe retailer said
sales in August fell 9.6 percent to 73.1 million zloty from a
year earlier.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN PW), Poland’s biggest oil company, slid
1.72 zloty, or 4.5 percent, to 36.3 zloty.  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)  , the second-largest refiner, lost 1.72 zloty, or 6 percent,
to 26.78 zloty. Oil declined as investors speculated that signs
the Chinese and U.S. economies are weakening indicate fuel
demand will falter in the world’s biggest crude-consuming
nations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
