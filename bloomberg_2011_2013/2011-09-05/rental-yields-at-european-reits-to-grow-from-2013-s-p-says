Rental yields for European real
estate investment trusts are likely to begin rising starting in
2013, according to  Standard & Poor’s .  Stable occupancy rates and “strong” demand from tenants
will drive rent increases and improve cash flows for REITs, the
New York-based ratings company said today in a statement.  Three of the 10 European real estate companies that S&P
monitors have had their ratings upgraded to “stable” from
‘’negative” this year, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
