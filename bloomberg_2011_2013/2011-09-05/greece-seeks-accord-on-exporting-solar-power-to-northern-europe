Europe  needs an “urgent” agreement
on exporting solar power from countries in the sunnier south to
those in the north after Germany decided to phase out nuclear
generation, Greek Energy Minister  George Papaconstantinou  said.  There’s a “clear need, especially in Germany,” for
imports of renewable energy from southern Europe given the
country’s vow to abandon atomic power, and political turmoil in
the Middle East, Papaconstantinou said today in Hamburg.  Greece proposes to build solar plants in old mines and army
installations, he said. Public and private funding for projects
is also needed before exports will be possible, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
