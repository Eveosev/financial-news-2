The Australian and New Zealand
dollars extended declines amid concerns  Europe â€™s debt crisis is
making it harder for banks to borrow among themselves.  The so-called Aussie slid to $1.0516 as of 8:54 a.m. in
Sydney from $1.0551 yesterday in  New York . The New Zealand
currency weakened to 82.83 U.S. cents, the lowest since Aug. 26,
before trading at 82.85 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
