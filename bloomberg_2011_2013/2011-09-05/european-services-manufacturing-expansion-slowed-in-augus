European services and manufacturing
growth weakened in August as tougher austerity measures and
waning global demand clouded prospects for economic growth.  A composite index based on a survey of euro-area purchasing
managers in both industries fell to 50.7 from 51.1 in July,
London-based Markit Economics said today. It had initially
reported an unchanged reading of 51.1. A reading above 50
indicates growth.  Europe ’s economy may continue to weaken after expanding
just 0.2 percent in the second quarter. Economic confidence
plunged in August and German investors were the most pessimistic
in 2 1/2 years. With growth faltering and governments struggling
to fight a worsening debt crisis, the  European Central Bank ’s
so-called shadow council earlier this month called on policy
makers to reverse this year’s rate increases.  The euro-area services indicator fell to 51.5 last month
from 51.6 in July, Markit said. The manufacturing gauge slipped
to 49 from 50.4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
