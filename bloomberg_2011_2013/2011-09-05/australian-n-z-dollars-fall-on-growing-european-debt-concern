The Australian dollar dropped to its
lowest level in more than a week on speculation  Europe ’s
sovereign debt crisis will impede global economic growth,
damping demand for higher-yielding assets.  The Aussie earlier pared declines after the  Reserve Bank  of
Australia left  interest rates  unchanged and said the nation is
benefiting from a mining boom even as volatility in financial
markets hurts confidence. New Zealand’s currency fell against 15
of its 16 major peers as Asian stocks slid.  “There’s a lot of uncertainty around Europe, but we still
like the medium-term Australian story, so we would be buyers on
dips,” said Grant Turley, a senior currency strategist at
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Sydney. “The RBA
is saying that domestically the outlook is still quite strong,
but the rest of the world is looking highly uncertain, so it’s
not appropriate to hike, but it’s not appropriate to cut rates
either.”  Australia ’s currency fell 0.2 percent to $1.0527 as of
11:35 a.m. in  New York  from $1.0551 yesterday, and touched
$1.0487, the least since Aug. 26. It rose 0.4 percent to 81.49
yen. New Zealand’s dollar slid as low as 82.15 U.S. cents, the
least since Aug. 23, before buying 82.51 cents from 83.22 cents
yesterday. The currency weakened to 63.84 yen from 63.98 yen.  Factory orders in Germany, Europe’s largest economy,
dropped 2.8 percent from June, when they rose 1.8 percent, the
Economy Ministry in Berlin said in a statement today.  The Australian dollar erased some of its earlier losses
after the RBA left interest rates unchanged at 4.75 percent for
a ninth-straight meeting. Governor  Glenn Stevens  said in a
statement today that “global financial markets have been very
unsettled over recent weeks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
