Refiners’ profits from making
naphtha fell on signs that gasoline demand in the U.S., the
world’s biggest consumer of the fuel, is slowing. Processing
losses from  fuel oil  narrowed, while profits from gasoil rose.  Light Distillates  September swaps for naphtha, a petrochemicals and gasoline
feedstock, dropped $18.25, or 1.9 percent, to $946.50 a metric
ton, at 11:12 a.m. Singapore time, according to data from PVM
Oil Associates Ltd., a broker.  The crack spread, a measure of the refining margin for
processing  Brent crude  into the fuel, declined to $104.73 a ton
from $117.36 at the end of Asian trading on Sept. 2, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Gasoline futures in  New York  fell after a report showed U.S.
employers added no jobs in August, increasing concern that
slowing economic growth will reduce fuel demand.  The October contract dropped 16 cents to $2.8241 a gallon
at 11:35 a.m. Singapore time in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . Prices declined for the third day, the
longest losing streak since the seven days to Sept. 4.  “The 2011 U.S. driving season is drawing to a close,”
 Paul Horsnell  and Amrita Sen, London-based analysts at Barclays
Plc, said in a note to clients dated Sept. 2. The bank said U.S.
gasoline demand fell 4.1 percent from a year earlier during the
driving season, which typically stretches from the Memorial Day
holiday at the end of May to Labor Day in September.  Middle Distillates  October swaps for gasoil fell 5 cents to $126.39 a barrel,
PVM data showed. Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil, or the regrade,
declined 15 cents to $1.70 a barrel, PVM data showed. The
narrower spread signaled reduced profits from making  aviation
fuel  over diesel.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude, a measure of processing
profit for the fuel, rose $2.04, or 11 percent, to $20.22 a
barrel, the highest in more than three weeks.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude shrank to $4.98 a barrel
from $7.07 on Aug. 2, PVM data showed. The spread narrowed for
the first time in eight trading sessions, ending the longest
period of declining margins since September 2009.  High-sulfur fuel-oil swaps were unchanged at $657.75 a ton,
PVM data showed.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to the 380-
centistoke grade was at $10.25, unchanged from last week. The
viscosity spread has gained from $8 a ton a week earlier,
signaling that prices power-generation fuel have risen more than
shipping fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
