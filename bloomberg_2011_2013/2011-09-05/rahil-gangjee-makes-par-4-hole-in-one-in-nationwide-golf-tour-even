Rahil Gangjee of  India  became the
third golfer in  Nationwide Tour  history to make a hole-in-one on
a par 4 during the final round of the Mylan Classic.  Gangjee was 1-over-par through 14 holes yesterday at the
Southpointe Golf Club in Canonsburg,  Pennsylvania , when he aced
the 316-yard 15th hole with a driver.  “I started it off left and let it go to the right and then
it bounced and flattened out,” Gangjee said of his fourth
career hole-in-one and second in competition. “I thought I saw
the ball roll onto the green but I didn’t see it go in and then
everyone around the green went nuts.”  Gangjee finished 11 strokes behind winner Gary Christian,
tied at 6-under par with a group of players including 2008 U.S.
Open runner-up Rocco Mediate.  Richard Johnson was the last player to make a hole-in-one
on a par-4 on the second-tier Nationwide Tour in 2009. Chip Beck
was the first in 2003.  Andrew Magee was the last player to accomplish the feat on
the  PGA Tour , acing the 333-yard, 17th hole at the 2001 Phoenix
Open in Scottsdale,  Arizona .  To contact the reporter on this story:
