Berkeley Group Holdings Plc (BKG) , the
U.K.’s largest homebuilder by market value, said it may reach a
goal of doubling pretax profit two years earlier than expected
as sales improved.  The Cobham, England-based company said in May last year
that it aimed to double the profit figure within five years.
Since that time, business has exceeded the company’s estimates
and Berkeley will probably hit that target “at least two years
earlier than originally anticipated,” it said in a statement
today.  Berkeley pre-sold 850 million pounds ($1.4 billion) of new
homes during the four months through Aug. 31, according to the
statement. It reiterated a 10-year plan to return 13 pounds a
share to investors through 2021.  Berkeley has focused on building homes in  London  and
southeast  England , where the housing market has been the most
resilient since the financial crisis began. The company
abandoned high-volume homebuilding in 2004 to concentrate on
building houses rather than apartments in urban areas.  The shares rose 3 percent to 1,215 pence in London trading
as of 8:03 a.m. Berkley has gained 39 percent this year,
boosting its market value to 1.61 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
