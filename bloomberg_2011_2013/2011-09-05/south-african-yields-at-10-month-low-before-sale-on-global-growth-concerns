South African 25-year government
bond yields fell to the lowest in 10 months before tomorrow’s
auction of the debt as signs of slowing global growth boost
demand for fixed-income securities.  The Pretoria-based  Reserve Bank  is selling 1.1 billion rand
($154.7 million) of the 6.25 percent securities due 2036 and 1
billion rand of 6.5 percent notes due 2041. The secondary-market
yield on the 2036 bonds dropped 13 basis points, or 0.13
percentage point, to 8.119 percent today, the lowest on a
closing basis since Nov. 22 2010.  South Africa ’s economy, Africa’s biggest, expanded an
annualized 1.3 percent in the second quarter, its slowest pace
in almost two years, as manufacturing and mining output plunged.
A report on Sept. 2 showed U.S. employers added no jobs in
August, adding to signs growth in the world’s largest economy is
moderating.  Lower bond yields are “being driven by bearish growth
sentiment,” Tradition Analytics strategists led by
Johannesburg-based Quinten Bertenshaw wrote in a research note.
“It is unlikely that longer-dated bonds will come under
sustained pressure from here.”  Global stocks extended losses today and bonds rallied on
concern  Europe ’s debt crisis may worsen, slowing growth in the
euro region, after an election loss for  Germany ’s ruling party
stoked speculation support for bailouts of Europe’s indebted
states is fading.  Tomorrow’s auction starts at 11 a.m., and the results will
be announced at about 11:30 a.m., the Reserve Bank said on
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
