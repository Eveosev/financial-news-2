Gold rose above $1,900 an ounce on
speculation that economic growth will slow and  Europe ’s debt
woes will worsen, boosting demand for a protection of wealth.  European equities dropped after an election loss for German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s party spurred concern that support
for bailing out Europe’s indebted nations may fade. Bullion
jumped 3.1 percent on Sept. 2, the most in almost four weeks, as
data showed the U.S. jobs market stalled in August, prompting
renewed speculation that the country’s economy may be headed for
a recession.  “With the implications of Friday’s U.S. payrolls report
and intense focus on European sovereign issues this week, gold
has two strong reasons to rally,”  Edel Tully , a London-based
analyst at UBS AG, wrote in a report. “Additional evidence of
U.S. economic weakness raises the likelihood that the  Federal
Reserve  will announce further easing this month. As European
woes reclaim center-stage and in turn investor nervousness
extends, these factors will support gold in the coming weeks.”  Gold for immediate delivery gained $17.82, or 0.9 percent,
to $1,900.70 an ounce by 7:06 p.m. in London, after touching
$1,903.52. The metal set a record at $1,913.50 on Aug. 23. In
 New York , gold futures for December delivery were up $26, or 1.4
percent, at $1,902.90 on the Comex, after touching $1,908.40.
Floor trading in the U.S. was closed today for the Labor Day
holiday.  The metal fell to $1,895 in the afternoon “fixing” in
London, used by some mining companies to sell output, from
$1,896.50 at this morning’s fixing.  Bull Market   Bullion is in the 11th year of a bull market, the longest
winning streak since at least 1920 in London, as investors seek
to diversify away from equities and some currencies. The metal
is up 33 percent this year, outperforming global stocks,
commodities and Treasuries. The metal climbed to a record priced
in euros and British pounds today.  Merkel’s party yesterday suffered its fifth election loss
this year after the chancellor failed to sway voters in her home
state with a campaign based on her handling of the euro area’s
debt crisis. European investor confidence fell to the lowest
level in more than two years in September, a report showed
today.  European sovereign-debt risk rose to a record based on
closing prices, according to traders of credit-default swaps.
World Bank President  Robert Zoellick  said in Beijing on Sept. 3
that the global economy is entering a “new danger zone” amid
Europe’s debt difficulties.  Growth Concerns  “U.S. growth concerns and euro-zone debt concerns continue
to overshadow markets,”  James Moore , an analyst at
TheBullionDesk.com in London, wrote in a report. Gold will be
supported by “investors seeking to diversify from the volatile
flows in equities.”  Gold exchange-traded-product holdings fell for a third day
on Sept. 2, declining 1.7 metric tons to 2,142.4 tons, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Assets reached a record 2,216.8 tons
on Aug. 8.  Silver for immediate delivery declined 0.5 percent to
$43.0375 an ounce. Platinum rose 0.2 percent to $1,888 an ounce.
Gold’s rally pushed its price above platinum today. An ounce of
platinum bought 1.19 ounces of gold on average this year, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Palladium fell 1.3 percent to
$764.50 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
