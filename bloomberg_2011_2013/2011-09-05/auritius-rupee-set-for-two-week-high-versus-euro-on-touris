Mauritius’s rupee headed for its
highest level in almost two weeks against the euro on increased
inflows because of tourist arrivals in the country.  The currency appreciated 1.1 percent to 39.4792 per euro by
6:01 p.m. in Port Louis, heading for its highest level on a
closing basis since Aug. 24, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The rupee gained 0.2 percent to 28.05 per dollar.  “The foreign-currency market is euro-dominated given
recurrent flows from  Europe  as its main trading partner and the
main source of tourist inflows,” Lourens Harmse, a trader at
 Absa Capital  in Johannesburg, wrote in an e-mailed response to
questions. The rupee is expected to trade between 39.50 and
40.50 per euro “in the short term,” he said.  Tourism, with textiles, is the country’s main earner of
foreign currency, with Europe accounting for almost two-thirds
of arrivals, according to the Mauritius Tourism Promotion
Authority. Euro-denominated earnings account for 41 percent of
foreign-currency revenue, according to the Bank of Mauritius.  The rupee has strengthened 4.5 percent against the euro
this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bank of
Mauritius Governor Rundheersing Bheenick asked exporters to
expand into other industries to offset the effects the gains.  Buying prices for the dollar ranged from 27.2656 to 27.4305
rupees, while the selling price was 28.7277 per dollar, compared
with 28.6227 on Sept. 1, according to  indicative exchange rates 
published today on the Bank of Mauritius’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
