Taiwan’s government bonds advanced,
pushing five-year yields to the lowest level since November, as
signs the U.S. economic recovery is faltering bolstered demand
for the safest assets. The local currency weakened.  The Taiex index of shares tumbled 2.7 percent after a Labor
Department report on Sept. 2 showed U.S. payrolls were unchanged
last month. Economists expected an increase of 68,000, a
Bloomberg survey showed. The island’s statistics bureau reported
toward the end of currency trading today consumer prices rose
1.34 percent in August from a year earlier. The median of 16
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 1.5 percent gain.  “Taiwan’s bond rally was supported by the bad U.S.
employment data,” said  James Wang , a fixed-income trader at
Yuanta Securities Co. in Taipei. “Bond performance will be
affected by mostly by stocks in the near term.”  The yield on the 2 percent notes due July 2016 fell five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 0.96 percent as of
the 1:30 p.m. close in Taipei, prices from Gretai Securities
Market show.  A government report due this week will show exports
increased 15.5 percent in August from a year earlier, compared
with a 17.6 percent gain in July, according to the median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Taiwan’s dollar weakened 0.2 percent to NT$29.071 versus
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.395 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
