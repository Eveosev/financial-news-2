Banco Santander SA (SAN)  has an agreement
with  Telefonica SA (TEF)  to tap information on the phone company’s
Latin American customers to be able to offer them products such
as insurance, Expansion reported.  Of Telefonica’s 190 million customers in the region, 42
percent are in Brazil, the newspaper said. The contract worth 38
million euros ($54 million), signed in 2009, has only just come
to light, Expansion said, without saying where it got the
information.
