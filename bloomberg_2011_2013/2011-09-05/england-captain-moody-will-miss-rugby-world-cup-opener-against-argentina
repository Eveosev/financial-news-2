 England captainLewis Moody
will miss his team’s Rugby World Cup opener against Argentina
after failing to recover from a knee injury.  Flanker Moody strained a ligament in the Aug. 6 World Cup
tune-up game against Wales and won’t be risked against the Pumas
in the Sept. 10 match in Dunedin,  New Zealand , England manager
 Martin Johnson  said at a news conference today.  “It was quite a simple decision to hold him back another
week,” Johnson, who’s scheduled to name his team in three days,
said in comments distributed by tournament organizers. “He’s
not a million miles away. It’s just one of those calls.”  Moody, 33, also injured his right knee in January and
missed all of Europe’s Six Nations championship. He’s been
limited to 62 minutes of Test rugby this year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
