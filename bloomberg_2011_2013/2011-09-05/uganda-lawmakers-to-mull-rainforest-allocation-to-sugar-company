Ugandan lawmakers will decide
whether to allow part of the Mabira Forest Reserve to be used
for sugar production, President Yoweri Museveni said.  Museveni said on Aug. 14 that a portion of the rainforest,
about 55 kilometers (34 miles) east of Kampala, should be given
to Sugar Corp. of  Uganda  Ltd., the nation’s third-largest
producer.  “This is not an executive order, it will be a parliamentary
decision,” he said in a statement e-mailed by his office
yesterday.  Uganda is seeking to boost sugar output after prices for
the sweetener more than doubled in the past two months amid
reduced cane supplies, forcing the government to abolish an
import tax on the commodity to cover the shortfall.  Sugar Corp. is jointly owned by the Mumbai-based Mehta
Group and the Ugandan government. Environmental groups including
Nature Uganda oppose the allocation of the land because the
forest is home to endangered monkey species and 300 types of
birds, as well as being a catchment area for Lake Victoria.  The initial allocation of part of the forest to the company
in 2007 led to protests in Kampala in which at least six people
died, according to the Daily Monitor newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
