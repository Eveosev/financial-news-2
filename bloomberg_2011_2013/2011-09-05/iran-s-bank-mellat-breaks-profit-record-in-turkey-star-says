Tehran-based Bank Mellat showed the
biggest increase in profits among all banks active in  Turkey 
over the first six months of the year, even amid sanctions
against Iranian financial institutions,  Star  newspaper reported.  Bank Mellat reported profits in Turkey of 32.6 million
liras ($18.5 million) in the first half, a 217 percent increase
over last year’s figure for the same period of 10.3 million and
the biggest increase among banks in Turkey, Star said.  The U.S. government called on Turkey to “isolate” the
branches of Bank Mellat in April, saying it was providing
financial support for  Iran’s nuclear program , the Turkish press
had reported then citing U.S. officials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
