Croatia, which hopes to join the
European Union in 2013, will face slower-than-expected growth
amid low industrial output, declining foreign investment and
deteriorating global economic conditions, new estimates show.  Gross domestic product will probably grow 0.6 percent this
year, said Hrvoje Stojic, chief analyst at Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank
d.d, a local unit of  Austria ’s Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank
International AG. The  Chamber of Commerce  today also revised its
forecast for the year down to 1 percent to 1.5 percent, below
the government’s forecast of 1.5 percent made on July 27.  “Despite a record tourist season, we had to reduce our
2011 GDP growth forecast below the consensus of 1 percent to 1.5
percent, given severe industry underperformance and hesitant
investments,” Stojic told a conference in  Zagreb  today.  Prospects for a solid recovery were pushed “beyond 2012”
as weaker confidence, difficult bank-funding conditions and
increased fiscal consolidation in the euro-area hurt growth
expectations, Stojic said.  The Adriatic Sea nation is struggling to recover from a
recession as foreign direct investment declined to $583 million
in 2010 from $6 billion in 2008. GDP grew 0.8 percent in the
second quarter from a year ago, after declining 0.8 percent in
the first quarter and 1.2 percent in 2010.  Fragile Outlook  Stojic said the economy will expand 1.5 percent next year
and 2.5 percent in 2013 when the Balkan country joins the
European Union and can claim up to 2 billion euros (2.8 billion)
of EU funds. The estimate is less than the government’s forecast
for growth of 2.5 percent next year and 3.5 percent in 2013.  Delayed changes by the government in how welfare and other
mandatory expenses contribute to the budget, in addition to the
worsened macroeconomic outlook, will cause the fiscal deficit to
“stay above 5 percent of GDP this year and the next,” Stojic
said, up from the government’s forecast of 4.3 percent this year
and 3.4 percent in 2012.  Stojic “doesn’t exclude the possibility” of an
arrangement with the  International Monetary Fund  as global
tensions will increase pressure on the government to accelerate
the reforms.  Croatia  is preparing to become the EU’s 28th member in July
2013. The country faces general elections on Dec. 4. The
opposition  Social-Democratic Party  is leading opinion polls at
24 percent, while the ruling  Croatian Democratic Union  had 20
percent backing in an Aug. 26  IPSOS-Puls  survey of 1,000 people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
