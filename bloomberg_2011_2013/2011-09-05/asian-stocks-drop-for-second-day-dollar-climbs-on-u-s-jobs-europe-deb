Stocks fell, Italian bonds dropped
for an 11th day and the cost of government and bank default

worsen. The euro weakened, while the dollar and gold gained.  The MSCI All-Country World Index sank 2 percent at 4:31
p.m. in  New York . Banks led the Stoxx Europe 600 Index down 4.1

unlikely to change for the better in Europe.”  Deutsche Bank AG Chief Executive Officer  Josef Ackermann 
said conditions in the stock and bond markets are reminiscent of
the financial crisis of late 2008.  ‘New Normal’  “The ‘new normal’ is characterized by volatility and
uncertainty -- not only in respect to market developments, but
also in consideration of the future of the financial branch,”
Ackermann said today at a conference in  Frankfurt  organized by
Euroforum. “All this reminds one of the fall of 2008, even
though the European banking sector is significantly better
capitalized and less dependent on short-term liquidity.”  All 19 industries in the Stoxx 600 retreated, with losses
ranging between 2.6 percent and 5.9 percent. Deutsche Bank AG,
Credit Suisse Group AG, Barclays Plc, Societe Generale SA and
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc dropped at least 6.6 percent.

each other, rose to 0.77 percentage point, the widest gap since

the Stoxx 600, after the chemical maker cut its sales and
profit-margin projections for this year.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Italian 10-year

as much as 3.18 percentage points to 50.38 percent. The 10-year
