The U.K. Serious Fraud Office said
it is looking into sales of asset-backed securities by banks as
part of a “scoping exercise” to gather information on how the
market works.  The inquiry stops short of a full investigation, said SFO
spokeswoman Katie Winstanley. The Financial Times reported today
that the SFO is seeking whistleblowers to provide evidence of
whether banks, including  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , misrepresented
securities they packaged for clients.  SFO Director Richard Alderman has been talking to companies
in the financial district as part of an “open-door policy,”
although he hasn’t confirmed which banks he has talked to,
Winstanley said in a phone interview today.  The U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency last week sued 17
banks for allegedly misleading Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac  about
billions of dollars of residential mortgage-backed securities.
The suits included European lenders such as Deutsche Bank,
Barclays Plc, HSBC Holdings Plc, Societe Generale SA and Credit
Suisse Group AG.  Ronald Weichert, a spokesman for Frankfurt-based Deutsche
Bank, declined to comment on the SFO inquiry.  To contact the reporter for this story:
