Iran  and Tajikistan started a $220-
million hydro power station jointly built in the Central Asian
country, the official  Islamic Republic News Agency  reported.  Iran’s President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who was on the second
day of his trip to Tajikistan, and his counterpart Emomali Rakhmon attended the ceremony today for the start of the first
unit of the Sangtoudeh-2 plant, IRNA said.  Tajikistan is one of the most vulnerable economies in
Central Asia as it doesn’t have the energy resources of other
countries in the region, the  International Monetary Fund  said in
April. Iran will invest $180 million and Tajikistan $40 million
in the plant, which has two units with an output capacity of 110
megawatts each, according to IRNA.  Construction started in 2006 by an Iranian company,
according to IRNA. The plant’s revenue will go to Iran for 12
years after which its ownership will be transferred to
Tajikistan, it said. Annual trade between the nations amounts to
about $200 million, according to Iran’s foreign ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
