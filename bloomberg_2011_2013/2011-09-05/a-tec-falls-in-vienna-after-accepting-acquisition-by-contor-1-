A-Tec Industries AG (ATEC) , an insolvent
Austrian engineering company, plummeted in Vienna trading after
saying it accepted the offer of Contor Industries GmbH dated
June 30 to fulfill the 47 percent quota under A-Tec’s Dec. 29
restructuring plan.  Shares had the biggest decline in almost three months,
falling 20 percent to 1.82 euros at the 5:30 p.m. close of
trading in the Austrian capital. A-Tec has lost 68 percent since
filing for bankruptcy on Oct. 20.  As part of the deal, Wolong Holding Group Co. Ltd. will
purchase all of A-Tec’s shares in ATB Austria Antriebstechnik
Aktiengesellschaft, with Solstice International Investments Inc
acquiring all shares in Minerals&Metals Holding GmbH and
PalmSquare International FZC purchasing the Voitsberg power
plant, A-Tec said.  “All payments resulting from the offers must be made no
later than 30.9.2011 to the fiduciary account of Dr Matthias
Schmidt, attorney at law,” A-Tec said in a statement. “The
payments shall, together with the funds already deposited with
the trustee, enable the fulfillment of the restructuring plan
quota.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
