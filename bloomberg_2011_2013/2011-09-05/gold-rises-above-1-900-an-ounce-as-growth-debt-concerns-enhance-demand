Gold surged to a record above $1,920
an ounce on speculation that  Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen,
damping economic growth and driving investors to protect their
wealth. Futures in  India  and China, the world’s two largest
consumers, touched all-time highs.  Gold for immediate delivery gained as much as 1.1 percent
to $1,921.15 an ounce, surpassing the previous peak of $1,913.50
reached Aug. 23. It was at $1,919.85 by 2:12 p.m. Singapore
time. December delivery futures in  New York  also touched a
record $1,923.10, up 2.5 percent from their close on Sept. 2.
Floor trading in the U.S. was shut yesterday for  Labor Day.  “Europe has the capacity to drive gold higher as it looks
unlikely to have its problems resolved very soon,” said  Darren Heathcote , head of trading at Investec Bank ( Australia ) Ltd. “I
don’t think investors are really convinced that European
governments have got what it takes, got the political will to
sort out the crisis and also do it sooner rather than later.”  Gold is in the 11th year of a bull run, the longest rally
since at least 1920 in  London , as investors seek to diversify
away from equities and some currencies. It climbed to records
priced in euros, British pounds and Canadian dollars today.  Asian equities dropped for a third day as Finnish, German
and Dutch finance ministers meet today to discuss a demand by
 Finland  for collateral in  Greece ’s bailout, threatening rescue
measures for the region. U.S. stock futures declined, indicating
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may slide for a third day before
Italian lawmakers debate an austerity package amid a strike
called by the nation’s biggest union.  India, China  Gold futures in India, the world’s biggest bullion consumer
advanced to a record, gaining as much as 0.9 percent to 28,730
rupees ($623) per 10 grams on the Multi Commodity Exchange of
India Ltd. Investment demand in India jumped 78 percent to 108.5
metric tons in the second quarter, while jewelry demand gained
17 percent to 139.8 tons, the World Gold Council said on Aug.
18.  Bullion for December delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange climbed for a third day, rising as much as 1.9 percent
to an all-time high of 398 yuan ($62.28) a gram.  China ’s gold
investment demand surged 44 percent in the second quarter from a
year ago to 53 tons, according to the World Gold Council. That
was the second-largest after India.  “Renewed Eurozone debt woes continued to plague financial
markets,” Phillip Futures analysts including Ong Yi Ling wrote
in a note today. “Political disunity could hamper efforts to
solve the debt crisis.”  Gold futures on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange also climbed
to a record today.  Central Banks  Gold is up 35 percent this year, outperforming global
stocks, commodities and Treasuries as holding in exchange-traded
products reached a record 2,216.756 tons on Aug. 8 and central
banks added to their reserves for the first time in a
generation.  Colombia increased its gold reserves by 2.3 tons in July,
according to data on the International Monetary Fund’s website,
joining  Thailand ,  South Korea  and  Russia  in adding bullion to
reserves this year.  In the second quarter of 2011, central bank and government-
institution buying rose almost fivefold to 69.4 tons, taking the
first-half total to 192.3 tons, according to the World Gold
Council. In 2010, central banks became net buyers for the first
time in two decades and they will remain net buyers this year,
it said.  Platinum for immediate delivery gained 0.3 percent to
$1,894.45 an ounce, trading below gold for a second day. Cash
silver rose 0.6 percent to $43.1862 an ounce and palladium added
0.5 percent to $768.50 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
