Turkish real estate developer  Nurol
Gayrimenkul Yatirim Ortakligi AS (NUGYO)  will invest about 160 million
liras ($91 million) in a project on the grounds of Yildiz
Technical University in Istanbul,  Hurriyet  newspaper said.  About 200 units, most of them office space, will be built
after Nurol won a tender for the land from state housing
developer TOKI, the paper said, citing Musa Aykac, general
manager of the company.  Nurol, which ranks 21st in assets among 23 listed real
estate developers in  Turkey , aims to invest 600 million liras to
meet its goal of ranking in the top five, Hurriyet quoted Aykac
as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
