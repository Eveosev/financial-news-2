Mauritius’s central bank has
“sufficient space” to cut its benchmark  interest rate  next
week to spur investments and growth, the Joint Economic Council,
a grouping of industry associations, said.  “Risks of inflationary pressure have been reined in,” Raj
Makoond, director of the council, told reporters in the capital,
 Port Louis , today. “Focus should be on growth. The
international business climate has deteriorated since June.”  The Bank of Mauritius, which will make its next interest
rate decision on Sept. 12, raised the key rate twice this year
to 5.5 percent to curb price pressures. Inflation accelerated to
an annual 6.7 percent in July from 6.6 percent in the previous
month, the statistics office said on Aug. 5.  Lower rates may help to support the economy as a slowdown
in  Europe  threatens to crimp export demand. Europe buys 65
percent of the country’s manufactured goods, and accounts for
almost two-thirds of tourist arrivals, according to the
country’s statistics agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
