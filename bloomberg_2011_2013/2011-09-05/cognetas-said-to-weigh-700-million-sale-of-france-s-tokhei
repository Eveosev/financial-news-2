Cognetas LLP, the U.K. buyout firm
that split from Electra Partners LLP in 2005, is exploring a
sale of  Tokheim SAS  that may fetch as much as 500 million euros
($706 million), said three people with knowledge of the matter.  Cognetas hired  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  to manage a deal for
the Paris-based maker of gas-station equipment, said the people,
who declined to be identified as the process is private. The
London-based buyout firm has a meeting with banks over financing
this week, one of them said.  Cognetas bought Tokheim, whose products include gasoline
pumps and payment systems, in 2005 from AXA Private Equity for
249.4 million euros. Tokheim’s annual revenue has since risen by
almost two-thirds to 590 million euros as of April 2011, partly
through expansion in  China  and India and acquisitions across
Western Europe, according to its website.  The firm expects about 615 million euros in revenue in the
year through April 2012, one of the people said. AXA Private
Equity had acquired the company in 2003 from  Fort Wayne ,
Indiana-based Tokheim Corp., which had filed for  bankruptcy
protection  the year before.  An official at Cognetas declined to comment. The firm
typically seeks stakes valued at as much as 250 million euros in
European companies, according to its  website . Other investments
include Italian pet-goods retailer Arcaplanet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
