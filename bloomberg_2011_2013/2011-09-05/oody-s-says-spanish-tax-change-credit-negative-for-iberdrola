Moody’s Investors Service said
 Spain ’s changes to tax rules for companies are “credit
negative” for  Iberdrola SA. (IBE)   The Spanish utility may have to pay around 400 million
euros more to the government over the next three years as the
government changes the tax-payment calendar, Moody’s said in a
report today. The move “fuels investor concerns that the
Spanish government may impose additional tax burdens on Spanish
corporates because of pressures on the sovereign,” it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
