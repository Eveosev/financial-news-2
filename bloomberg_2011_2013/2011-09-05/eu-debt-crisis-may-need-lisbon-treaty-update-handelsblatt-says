The European Union may need to amend
the Treaty of Lisbon to create a legal basis for pushing
economic integration, Annette Schavan,  Germany ’s Minister for
Education and Research, told the  Handelsblatt  newspaper in an
interview.  The EU may need to set up a supranational “economic
government” to achieve a common, binding policy, Schavan was
cited as saying, adding that such a step may need to be anchored
in the trade bloc’s treaties.  The Lisbon Treaty became law in 2009 to provide a new
constitutional basis for a widened EU.  To contact the reporter on this story:
