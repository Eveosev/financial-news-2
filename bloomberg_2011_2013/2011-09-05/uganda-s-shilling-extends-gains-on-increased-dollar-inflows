Uganda’s shilling, the world’s
worst-performer this year, gained for the second day as dollar
inflows increased amid lower demand for the greenback.  The currency of  East Africa ’s third-biggest economy
appreciated 0.3 percent to 2,807.75 per dollar by 2:41 p.m. in
the capital, Kampala, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency closed at 2,815 on Sept. 2.  “Basically there is a lack of dollar demand and we saw
increased inflows last week to the non-governmental sector,”
Faisal Bukenya, the head of  currency trading  at  Barclays Bank  of
Uganda Ltd. said by phone from Kampala. “We have seen inflows
of the dollar increasing.”  Local demand for the U.S. currency has dropped because
major buyers have just concluded their end-of-month
transactions, he said.  The shilling has slumped 9.2 percent in the last two months
and 18 percent this year against the dollar, making it the
world’s worst-performing currency during both periods. A surge
in food and fuel prices pushed inflation to a more than 18-year
high of 21.4 percent in August from 18.8 percent in July, the
 Uganda  Bureau of Statistics said on Aug. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
