 The  Inter-American Development Bank 
will help  Colombia  develop a trading system for carbon credits
generated by local companies as the nation seeks to cut its
greenhouse gas emissions.  The $10.5 million project will also help companies
calculate how many so-called Verified Emissions Reductions
theyâ€™ve produced through measures that may include saving or
replanting forests, the Washington-based bank said today in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
