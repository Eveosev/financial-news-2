Israel  is to blame for escalating
tensions, Turkish Trade Minister Zafer Caglayan said.  Israel’s government is acting in a populist manner in its
relations with  Turkey  and will lose out in the end, Caglayan
said at a news conference in the Turkish capital Ankara today.  Turkey is not considering trade sanctions against Israel
and Israel is a “good” trade partner, Caglayan said. Turkey
exported $1.5 billion of goods to Israel this year, making it
the 17th biggest market for Turkish goods, he said. It imported
$1.2 billion of goods from Israel, meaning Turkey is Israel’s
sixth biggest export market, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
