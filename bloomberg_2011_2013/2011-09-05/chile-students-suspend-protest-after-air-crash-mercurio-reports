Chilean students called off
demonstrations planned for this week out of respect for the
victims of a Sept. 2 airplane accident that killed 21 people, El
Mercurio  reported , citing protest leader Camila Vallejo.  The students, who had planned nationwide marches for Sept.
8 to push for lower cost and higher quality schooling, will
respond this week to government proposals that would set a
timeline to change the education system, the Santiago-based
newspaper reported on its website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
