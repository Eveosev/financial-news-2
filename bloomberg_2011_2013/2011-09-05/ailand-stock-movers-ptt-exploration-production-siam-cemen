Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in  Thailand  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the 12:30 p.m. break in
Bangkok.  The SET Index fell for a third day, declining 13.69 points,
or 1.3 percent, to 1,051.49.  Energy companies:  PTT Pcl (PTT)  , Thailand’s biggest
energy company, slid 1.2 percent to 324 baht.  PTT Exploration &
Production Pcl (PTTEP)  , the nation’s only publicly traded oil
explorer, lost 2.7 percent to 162.5 baht.  Banpu Pcl (BANPU)  ,
the biggest coal producer, decreased 1.9 percent to 628 baht.  Crude oil fell for a second day in New York as investors
speculated that signs the U.S. and Chinese economies are
weakening indicate fuel demand will falter in the world’s
biggest crude-consuming nations. Lower oil prices may reduce
demand for alternative fuels such as coal.  Siam Cement Pcl (SCC)  , the nation’s fourth-largest
company by market value, dropped 2.1 percent to 321 baht, poised
for the steepest decline in more than a week. Siam Cement is
among companies considering acquiring Indonesia’s PT Sulfindo
Adiusaha, according to three people with knowledge of the
matter.  Siam Cement and other companies have made non-binding bids
for control of the privately owned chemicals producer, said the
people, who asked not to be named because the process is
private. Venus Asavasitthithavorn, a Bangkok-based spokeswoman
for Siam Cement, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
