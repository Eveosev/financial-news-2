Dangote Sugar Refinery Plc (DANGSUGA)  shares
fell to their lowest level since January 2009 in Lagos after the
country’s biggest producer of the sweetener forecast third-
quarter net income of 1.7 billion naira ($10.9 million).  “The guidance is quite weak,” Esili Eigbe, a Lagos-based
analyst with Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc, said by phone today.  Profit fell 48 percent during the first six months of its
financial year, the company said on Sept. 1. Net income declined
to 3 billion naira.  Dangote Sugar shares fell by 4 percent to 9.8 naira, its
lowest value since Jan. 29, 2009, by the 2:30 p.m. close in
Lagos. The stock has fallen by 39 percent this year, compared
with a 13 percent decline in the Nigerian Stock All-Share Index
over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
