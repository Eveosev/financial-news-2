Standard Bank Group Ltd. Chief
Executive OfficerJacko Maree said competitive pay packages will
help the fight against poverty as it will ensure successful
companies are built.  “Successful large and small businesses, which are able to
compete effectively, will create productive jobs over time,
enabling more of our people to earn better incomes in the years
ahead,” he wrote in an opinion piece published in Johannesburg-
based Business Day today.  “It is typically a relatively small number of key
employees who, by taking and then implementing important
decisions effectively, significantly influence the success of
any business,” Maree, who has led the bank since 1999, said.
These individuals, while not only motivated by money, are in
high demand both locally and abroad and need to be retained and
rewarded appropriately, he said.  Maree contributes 10 percent of his taxable income to help
boost education and will now switch the focus of his funds to
help needy black scholars receive a good education, he wrote.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
