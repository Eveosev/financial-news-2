Tokyo Electric Power Co. said the
temperature of the No. 3 reactor pressure vessel at its crippled
Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant fell to below 100 degrees Celsius (212
Fahrenheit), one of the conditions for achieving cold shutdown.  The temperature on the outside of the base of the vessel
was 98.4 degrees Celsius at 5:00 a.m. today from 102.7 degrees
24 hours earlier after the utility known as Tepco this month
added a spraying system to cool the reactor, Junichi Matsumoto,
a general manager, told reporters.  It doesnâ€™t mean the reactor has reached cold shutdown
status because the utility still needs to assess the amount of
radioactive materials leaking from the reactor, he said.
Temperatures remain higher than 100 degrees on other sections of
the reactor, the utility said.  Temperatures on the No. 1 reactor remain below 100 degrees
Celsius after reaching that level around Aug. 20, Matsumoto
said. The temperature of the bottom of the No. 1 reactor vessel
was 85.1 degrees today, according to a table provided by the
company.  On the base of the No. 2 reactor the temperature was 112.6
degrees, according to Tepco.  Tepco has been pouring water into reactors after the March
11 earthquake and tsunami knocked out cooling system of the
Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant, leading to three reactor meltdowns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
