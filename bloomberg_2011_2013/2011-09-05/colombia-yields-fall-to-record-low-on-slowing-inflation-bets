Colombia ’s peso bonds jumped,
pushing yields to a record low, ahead of a government report
today that may show inflation slowed last month.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent bonds due in July
2024 fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 7.25
percent at 2:38 p.m. New York time. The yield is the lowest on a
closing price basis since the securities were issued in March
2009. The price of the bonds climbed 0.554 centavo to 122.497
centavos per peso.  Colombia’s consumer prices rose 0.13 percent in August from
the previous month after increasing 0.14 percent in July,
according to the median estimate of 25 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The national statistics agency is slated to publish
the monthly inflation report at 8 p.m. New York time.  “The market is betting on a low inflation number,” said
Camilo Contreras, a fixed-income analyst at Ultrabursatiles SA
brokerage in Bogota. “Wholesale data shows food prices have
been falling in the last few weeks and investors have been
incorporating that in their inflation forecasts.”  Colombia’s peso declined 0.3 percent to 1,788.5 per  U.S.
dollar  in the next-day market, according to the stock exchange’s
foreign-exchange electronic transactions system, known as SET-
FX. With U.S. markets closed today for Labor Day, Colombia’s
currency trades in the so-called next-day market, in which
payment and delivery are made the following trading day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
