Estonia ’s main problem is high
inflation, which is too far above the European Union average,
Prime Minister Andrus Ansip told public broadcaster  Eesti
Rahvusringhaeaeling  today.  “Inflation remains too high, even though it is higher than
usual” across the EU, Ansip said. The EU “hasn’t usually had
an average inflation rate of 2.5 to 2.7 percent but Estonia’s
inflation of 5 percent exceeds that by too much.”  Inflation has largely been driven by global price pressures
and should slow in the second half of 2011, Ansip said. Estonia
expects to end the year with a  budget surplus , following a 0.1
percent surplus in 2010, he added.  To contact the reporters on this story:
