KazMunaiGas Exploration Production (RDGZ) ,
the London-traded unit of  Kazakhstan ’s state-run energy company,
increased second-quarter profit 14 percent as  oil prices  rose.  Net income grew to 55.3 billion tenge ($376 million) from
48.4 billion tenge a year earlier, KazMunaiGas EP said today in
a statement. Sales gained 39 percent to 208.5 billion tenge.  Oil production fell 3 percent to 6.3 million metric tons in
the first half from a year earlier after power cuts and a strike
at fields belonging to its Uzenmunaigaz unit. Output is expected
to be 800,000 tons, or 6 percent, below the consolidated target
for this year at KazMunaiGas EP, according to the statement.  The average price of Brent crude oil in the first half was
$111 per barrel, up 44 percent from the $77 per barrel in the
same period last year, the company said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
