Jacques Der Megreditchian, chief
business officer at Troika Dialog and a former candidate to run
Moscow’s oldest brokerage, is leaving after 11 years, according
to an e-mailed statement.  Troika is considering several options, including external
candidates, to replace Der Megreditchian, said a spokeswoman who
declined to be named, citing company policy. Ruben Vardanian,
Troika’s chairman, who said a year ago that Der Megreditchian
was “the leading candidate” to replace him, plans to remain at
the bank for “at least three years,” the spokeswoman said. The
statement didn’t say where Der Megreditchian would work after
Troika.  Der Megreditchian ran  investment banking  at  France ’s
Societe Generale in  Russia  before joining Troika in 2000 where
he held a number of senior roles before being named chief
business officer and deputy CEO. State-run OAO Sberbank agreed
to acquire Troika in March, paying at least $1 billion for 100
percent of the company, including the 63.6 percent stake held by
Vardanian.  Der Megreditchian proposed a  management buyout  last year
after Vardanian said he wanted to quit in three to five years.  “I am convinced that the history of success will continue
to develop and that together with Sberbank, Troika will develop
a universal financial champion,” Megreditchian said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
