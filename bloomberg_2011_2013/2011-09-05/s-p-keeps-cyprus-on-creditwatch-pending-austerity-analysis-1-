Cyprus will remain on CreditWatch at
 Standard & Poor’s  pending an analysis of the government’s
planned second round of budget-consolidation measures, the
rating company said.  “The size of measures needed to achieve these targets is
estimated at 150 million euros ($211.4 million) or 0.8 percent
of gross domestic product in 2011 and 650 million euros or 3.5
percent in 2012,” S&P said in a statement in  London  today.
“The measures announced to date total 104 million euros or 0.6
percent of GDP in 2011, and 261 million euros or 1.3 percent in
2012.”  Cyprus, rocked by a July 11 explosion that destroyed its
largest power station and knocked out more than half of its
electricity-generating capacity, is struggling to avoid becoming
the latest victim of  Europe ’s debt crisis. Moody’s Investors
Service, S&P and  Fitch Ratings  have all downgraded Cyprus’s
credit rating since the blast amid concern it may become the
fourth European Union nation to require a bailout.  The east Mediterranean island, which seeks to trim its
 budget deficit  to 5.5 percent of GDP this year and 2 percent in
2012, needs further measures in addition to those approved on
August 26, S&P said. The company lowered the credit rating of
the euro area’s third-smallest economy to BBB+ from A2 on July
29, citing “inconsistent commitment” to cutting spending.  If Cyprus’s Parliament approves the proposed “credible”
second round of austerity, S&P could affirm its rating, provided
losses for Cypriot banks “associated with the restructuring
plans of Greek sovereign debt remain at current anticipated
levels” and other factors remain the same, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
