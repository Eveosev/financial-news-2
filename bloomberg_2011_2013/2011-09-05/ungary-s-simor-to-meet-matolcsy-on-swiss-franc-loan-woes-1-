Hungarian Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  will meet central bank President Andras Simor to
discuss ways to reduce the burden on borrowers who took out
loans in Swiss francs, this year’s best-performing currency.  Simor had asked to meet Prime Minister Viktor Orban, the
central bank said in an e-mailed statement today. Orban asked
Matolcsy to attend instead, Orban’s spokesman Peter Szijjarto
said later by e-mail.  The forint has weakened 13 percent against the Swiss franc
this quarter, hurting homeowners who borrowed in the Alpine
currency because  interest rates  were lower. Sixty-four percent
of Hungarian mortgages and 61 percent of local-council debt are
denominated in foreign currencies, mostly the franc, according
to central bank data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
