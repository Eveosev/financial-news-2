OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel plans to
invest 7.4 billion rubles ($250 million) this year to build a
railroad to two new mines in Siberia.  The link will transport copper and molybdenum from the
Bystrinskoe and Bugdainskoye deposits where the company plans to
start production in 2015-2016, it said in an e-mailed statement.
The mines will produce 62,000 tons of copper and 9,800 tons of
molybdenum at full capacity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
