National Bank of Fujairah PSC (NBF) , a
state-controlled lender in the  United Arab Emirates , plans to
begin trading base metals, energy, agriculture and carbon-offset
products in both physical and derivative markets.  The bank has called an extraordinary general meeting of
shareholders on Sept. 29 to approve an amendment to its articles
of association to allow the change, it said in a  statement  to
the Abu Dhabi bourse today. Its current articles of association
allowed it to trade only gold, silver and other precious metals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
