     Sept. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Anglo American Platinum Ltd. the
world’s largest producer of the metal, fell the most in 15
months in Johannesburg trading on concern that slowing global 
growth may erode demand.  The stock sank 5.4 percent to 528.08 rand at the 5 p.m. 
close, its biggest one-day decline since May 2010. Platinum, 
used in jewelry and pollution-control devices for cars, fell 
as much as 0.8 percent to $1,868.50 an ounce in  London .   Job growth in the U.S. unexpectedly stagnated in August, 
the weakest payrolls reading since September 2010, government 
figures showed Sept. 2. An index of investor confidence in 
the euro region declined today to the lowest level in more 
than two years. The MSCI World Index of shares dropped as much 
as 2 percent.  “It’s just the market taking a view on global growth and
that impacts things like auto production,”  Leon Esterhuizen , an
analyst at  RBC Capital Markets , said by phone from London. “The
market is clearly saying they don’t buy the current metal price
and think it is going to come down.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
