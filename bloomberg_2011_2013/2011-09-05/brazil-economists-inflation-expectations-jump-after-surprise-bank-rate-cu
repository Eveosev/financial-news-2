Analysts covering the Brazilian
economy are forecasting faster inflation as far ahead as 2013
after the central bank’s surprise half-point interest rate cut
last week.  Consumer prices will rise 5.32 percent next year, and 4.6
percent in 2013 according to the median forecasts in a Sept. 2
 central bank survey  of about 100 economists published today. The
forecasts were up from 5.2 percent and 4.5 percent respectively
the previous week. The 2012 increase was the biggest since
January.  The survey shows economists are skeptical about the central
bank’s view that the international crisis will be enough to
offset inflationary pressure coming from  Brazil ’s tight labor
market, said Flavio Serrano, senior economist at Espirito Santo
Investment Bank in Sao Paulo. Central bank President Alexandre Tombini cut the benchmark interest rate to 12 percent on Aug.
31, after raising it at the previous five policy meetings.  “The decision is hard to understand,” Serrano said.
“Inflation dynamics in Brazil have more to do with the domestic
side rather than the international side.”  This year, consumer prices as measured by the IPCA index
will rise 6.38 percent, the survey found, from a week-earlier
forecast of 6.31 percent. The central bank will cut its
benchmark Selic rate to 11.88 percent by the end of 2012, the
survey found.  Growth Outlook  Espirito Santo raised its own inflation forecast for next
year to 5.5 percent from 5 percent after the rate cut, and its
estimate for 2013 to 5 percent from 4.5 percent, Serrano said.
Inflation expectations as measured by the survey will continue
to rise and interest rate forecasts will fall over the next
weeks as more analysts adjust their forecasts, Serrano said.  Economists cut their estimate for the expansion in gross
domestic product this year for a fifth straight week, to 3.67
percent from 3.79 percent. Economists also cut their 2012 growth
forecast to 3.84 percent from 3.9 percent.  Inflation, as measured by the IPCA-15 index, accelerated
for the 12th straight month in August and exceeded 7 percent for
the first time since 2005. In a statement accompanying its
interest rate decision, the central bank said the global
slowdown, curbs on  government spending  and a cooling domestic
economy mean it can hit its inflation target even with lower
borrowing costs. Tombini has pledged to slow inflation to 4.5
percent by 2012, the midpoint of the target range.  Debt Crisis  Gross domestic product growth slowed to 0.8 percent last
quarter, from 1.2 percent in the first three months of the year,
according to data published last week. Unemployment fell to 6
percent in July, a record low for the month.  World stock markets lost $4 trillion in August as  Europe 
grappled with a sovereign debt crisis and global growth showed
signs of slowing. Even as it was raising  interest rates  earlier
in the year, the central bank repeatedly warned about a “higher
than usual uncertainty” in the world economy.  The yield on the interest rate futures contract maturing in
January 2013, the most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, fell 7 basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 10.770 percent at 8:20 a.m.
New York time. The real weakened 0.7 percent to 1.6523 per  U.S.
dollar .  To contact the reporter on this story:
