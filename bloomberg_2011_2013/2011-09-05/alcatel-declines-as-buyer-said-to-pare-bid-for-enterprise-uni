Alcatel-Lucent, the phone-equipment
maker in talks to sell its enterprise unit, fell for a second 
day in Paris trading after bidder Permira Advisers LLP was said 
to have decided against taking over the entire division.  Permira, which had been in exclusive talks to buy the
enterprise unit, is now in non-exclusive talks for  Genesys , the
part of the unit that makes software for managing customer call
centers, a person with direct knowledge of the talks said on
Sept. 2. Permira is a London-based buyout fund. Alcatel-Lucent
fell as much as 7.7 percent, after dropping 4.1 percent Sept. 2.  Alcatel-Lucent, a Paris-based networking company, has been
looking for buyers for its enterprise unit for several months,
and may raise about 1.5 billion euros ($2.12 billion), people
close to the situation said on April 29. Siemens Enterprise
Communications dropped out of talks for the entire unit about
two months ago, another person familiar with the matter said.  Alcatel-Lucent dropped as much as 19.6 cents and traded
19.3 cents lower at 2.352 euros as of 11:16 a.m. The shares had
risen 17 percent this year before today.  The company hasnâ€™t reported an annual profit since 2005 and
revenue has declined 10 percent since 2007, according to
Bloomberg data. Chief Executive Officer Ben Verwaayen is looking
to sell assets as part of a three-year turnaround plan for the
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
