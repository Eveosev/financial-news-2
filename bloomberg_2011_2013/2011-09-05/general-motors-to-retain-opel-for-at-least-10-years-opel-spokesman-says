General Motors Co. (GM)  plans to retain
ownership of German unit Adam Opel GmbH for at least 10 years,
Opel spokesman Stefan Weinmann said, confirming comments by GM’s
vice president of global public policy Robert Ferguson to Bild
Zeitung today.  Ferguson gave the assurance to Volker Bouffier, the premier
of the German state of Hesse where Opel has its headquarters,
during a visit to the U.S. last week, Weinmann said by phone.  Weinmann also confirmed comments by Opel’s Chief Executive
Officer Karl-Friedrich Stracke that the German carmaker’s access
to the Brazilian market will continue to be restricted.  “In  Brazil , the strategy is very clear: all vehicles sold
by GM are sold under the Chevrolet brand name,” Weinmann said.
“This has been the case for dozens of years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
