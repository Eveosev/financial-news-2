Commerzbank AG (CBK)  Chief Executive
Officer Martin Blessing said he doesn’t expect the lender to
become the takeover target of another bank,  Handelsblatt 
reported.  Any investor would have to buy the bank himself and provide
for refinancing, Blessing said in an interview to be published
in tomorrow’s edition of the newspaper. “A massive banking
takeover” would be “unlikely in that respect,” he said.  Separately, the CEO said the European Central Bank’s
program of purchasing  government securities  “is buying time”
for European governments. “Politicians must now make use of the
time. The ECB can’t act indefinitely in that way” should
governments fail to deliver on budget consolidation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
