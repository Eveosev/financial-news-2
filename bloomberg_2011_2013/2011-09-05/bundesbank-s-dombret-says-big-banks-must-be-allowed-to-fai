Bundesbank board member Andreas Dombret said so-called systemically important financial
institutions must be allowed to fail if needed.  “An exit from the market must be possible, and without
negatively affecting market stability or using taxpayers’
money,” Dombret said today at an event in  Frankfurt .  The  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision  ruled in June
that banks judged large or interconnected enough will have to
hold an additional 1 percent to 2.5 percent of total risk
weighted assets in core Tier 1 equity to reflect the danger they
pose to global markets.  “To have the characteristic of being systemically important
cannot be synonymous with being too big to fail,” Dombret said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
