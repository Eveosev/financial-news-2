Telecom Italia SpA (TIT)  may sell part of
its holdings in its Brazilian unit  Tim Participacoes SA (TCSL4)  to raise
between 2 billion reais ($1.2 billion) and 3 billion reais,
Valor Economico reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Telecom Italia has appointed banks for a possible
transaction and hasnâ€™t made a final decision about whether to
sell shares, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper said.  The company would maintain a controlling stake in Tim,
Valor said.  Telecom Italia denied it is preparing to sell, or
considering selling, any shares in the Brazil unit, according to
Valor.   To contact the reporter on this story:
