Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s biggest iron-
ore producer, said it may sell or lease 18 of its very large ore
carriers that are under construction because it’s not seeking to
become a major freight operator.  Vale is open to selling or leasing the so-called VLOCs in
long-term contracts, according to an e-mailed statement today.
The vessels may be transferred or leased to international ship
owners, including Chinese companies, the Rio de Janeiro-based
company said.  “Our goal is to encourage the construction of vessels
which are more efficient, with higher standards of operational
safety,” Vale said in the statement, adding that it also aims
to reduce freight market volatility. “Vale does not intend to
be a ship owner.”  China ’s largest shipping companies are lobbying the
government to foil Vale’s plan to build a $2.3 billion fleet of
the world’s biggest iron-ore carriers and want the company to
let shippers handle the transportation instead, Zhang Shouguo,
executive vice chairman of the China Shipowners Association,
said in a July interview.  Vale fell 67 centavos, or 1.7 percent, to close at 39.68
reais in Sao Paulo trading today. The stock has lost 18 percent
since the start of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
