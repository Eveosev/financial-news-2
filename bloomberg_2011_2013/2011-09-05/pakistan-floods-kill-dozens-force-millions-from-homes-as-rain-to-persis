Floods in  Pakistan ’s Sindh province
left more than 80 people dead and forced at least 4 million more
from their homes as rains that began Aug. 31 destroyed entire
villages, the government said.  “Some areas have received as much as 550 millimeters of
rainfall, which is the highest in the last 10 years,” Sindh’s
information minister, Sharjeel Memon, said by phone from the
provincial capital of Karachi. Pakistan’s meteorological office
predicts the weather system will persist for two more days,
inundating the same areas again.  Pakistan suffered its deadliest floods last year, in which
1,800 people were killed and an area the size of  Italy  was
devastated. The  Asian Development Bank  said the country had lost
$10 billion in property and agriculture. The government has set
aside 5 billion rupees ($57 million) to rehabilitate the
affected people, Memon said.  The death toll currently stands at 87, most of them from
rural areas, Memon said. Mobile health teams, malaria
vaccinations and special food packages have been dispatched to
the affected districts, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
