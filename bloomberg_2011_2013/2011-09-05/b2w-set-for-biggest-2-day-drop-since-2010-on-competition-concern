B2W Cia. Global do Varejo,  Brazil ’s
largest online retailer, posted its steepest two-day decline
since May 2010 amid concern rising competition will drive down
the company’s profits.  B2W fell 4.7 percent to 15.30 reais at the close of trading
in Sao Paulo at 4:15 p.m. New York time. The stock has slumped
12 percent in the past two sessions.  While the outlook for online retailers in Brazil is
“positive,” B2W is struggling to boost sales because its
logistics system hasn’t been able to keep up with rising demand
in the country, resulting in delayed deliveries, according to
Sandra Peres, an analyst at Sao Paulo-based brokerage
Coinvalores Corretora de Valores.  “Competition in the industry is getting tougher and
tougher,” Peres said in a phone interview today. “For B2W,
things are getting difficult, as the company has to deal with
increasing competition at the same time it has logistics
problems.”  A court banned B2W’s unit Americanas.com from selling goods
in Rio de Janeiro state in May after about 20,000 consumers
complained about delays in deliveries. The ban was lifted in
June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
