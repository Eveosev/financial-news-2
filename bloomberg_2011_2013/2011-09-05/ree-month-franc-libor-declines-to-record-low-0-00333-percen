The Libor rate that London-based
banks say they can borrow at in Swiss francs for three months
fell to a record low 0.00333 percent from 0.005 percent at the
end of last week, the British Bankers’ Association said.  Citigroup Inc. was the only lender among a panel of 12
contributors to submit a rate below zero, unchanged at negative
0.02 percent, BBA data show.  The  Swiss National Bank  lowered its target for three-month
franc Libor to “as close to zero as possible” on Aug. 3 as it
attempts to restrain the currency’s appreciation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
