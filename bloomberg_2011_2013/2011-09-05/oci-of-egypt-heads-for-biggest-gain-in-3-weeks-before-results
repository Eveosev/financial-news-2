Orascom Construction Industries (OCIC) ,
 Egypt â€™s largest publicly traded builder, headed for the biggest
increase in almost three weeks on speculation second-quarter
profit may rise 52 percent from a year earlier.  The shares of the Cairo-based company climbed 1.4 percent
to 243.26 Egyptian pounds at 12:18 p.m. in Cairo, poised for the
biggest daily gain since Aug. 17. That gave the company a market
value of 50.3 billion pounds ($8.4 billion). The benchmark  EGX
30 Index (EGX30)  advanced 0.9 percent.  Orascom Construction, also known as OCI, will report
second-quarter profit of 1.22 billion pounds, according to the
median estimate of five analysts compiled by Bloomberg. That
compares with a profit of 801 million pounds in the second
quarter of 2010, according to Bloomberg data. The company is
scheduled to report the results tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
