Tanzania ’s shilling headed for a
two-week low against the U.S. currency as companies increased
demand for the dollar.  The currency of East  Africa ’s second-biggest economy fell
0.2 percent to 1,624 per dollar, the weakest level since Aug.
22, by 12:35 p.m. in Dar es Salaam, the commercial capital.  “There have been outflows, mainly banks demanding dollars
for their clients,” Zainul Chandoo, head treasurer at Standard
Bank Group Ltd.’s local unit, said by phone today.  The shilling has depreciated 8.6 percent this year, making
it Africa’s worst performer after the Ugandan and Kenyan
currencies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
shilling reached 1,633.2 per dollar on Aug. 19, the weakest
level since October 1994 as Tanzania’s inflation rate climbed to
13 percent in July, the fastest pace in 15 months, on higher
energy and food costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
