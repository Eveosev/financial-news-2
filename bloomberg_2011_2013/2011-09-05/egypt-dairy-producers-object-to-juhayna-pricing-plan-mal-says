Egypt’s Dairy Producers Association
rejected a new pricing plan by  Juhayna Food Industries (JUFO) , the
country’s biggest packaged-milk producer,  Al Mal  reported,
citing the organization’s president Mohamed el-Tarouty.  The plan doesn’t account for fluctuations in prices of the
most important types of fodder, the Cairo-based daily cited el-
Tarouty as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
