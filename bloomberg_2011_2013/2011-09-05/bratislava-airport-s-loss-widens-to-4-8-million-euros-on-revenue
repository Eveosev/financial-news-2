State-owned Bratislava airport, the
largest in Slovakia, said its loss widened to 4.8 million euros
($6.8 million) last year from 2.7 million euros in 2009.  Revenue dropped 11 percent to 23.1 million euros,
M.R.Stefanik Airport said in on its website today.  The Slovak government is searching for a strategic partner
to run the airport, which competes for traffic with the airfield
in Vienna, less than 60 kilometers (37.2 miles) away. The
Bratislava airport is served by  Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA)  and Czech
Airlines, among others, and last year handled 1.66 million
passengers, a 3 percent drop from 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
