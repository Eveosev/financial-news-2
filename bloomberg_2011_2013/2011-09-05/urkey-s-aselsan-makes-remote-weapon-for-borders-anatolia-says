Aselsan Elektronik Sanayi & Ticaret
AS has developed a remote-controlled weapons platform for use on
 Turkey ’s borders, state-run news agency Anatolia reported,
without saying where it got the information.  The Stabilized Advanced Remote Platform, or SARP, includes
laser sighting, thermal imaging and cameras, and can be fitted
with 12.7mm or 7.62mm machine guns or 40mm rocket launchers, all
operated by remote control, Anatolia reported.  The platform was designed for border security and will also
be customized to fit Turkish tanks and to be deployed at
strategic sites, including certain police stations, Anatolia
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
