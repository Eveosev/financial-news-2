Sweden’s industrial labor unions
said the Nordic country’s economic rebound and export growth
mean companies are robust enough to pay out a 3.7 percent
average wage increase next year.  The one-year pay accord should take effect Feb. 1, 2012,
according to a press release published today in  Stockholm .
Unions will also seek more generous parental leave terms and
training, they said in the release.  Swedish Unions Within Industry, as the group is called, is
a partnership between five industrial unions, representing about
500,000 employees. Their salary agreements serve as a benchmark
for wage increases in other sectors. Negotiations with employers
start in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
