Saudi Arabia ’s Algosaibi family and
Saad Group founder Maan al-Sanea reached a preliminary agreement
after a royal committee found al-Sanea responsible for part of
the debt incurred by Algosaibi companies,  Alrroya Aleqtissadiya 
reported, citing unidentified persons.  The committee, which includes representatives from the
Saudi capital market authority and central bank, found al-Sanea
liable for the repayment of a “large portion” of the debt
incurred by Ahmad Hamad Algosaibi & Brothers Co. while under his
management, the newspaper reported.  In return, the Algosaibi family would have to drop all
lawsuits they have filed against him in nine cities worldwide.
The two groups had about $22 billion in combined debt, the
newspaper said.  Calls to both  Saad Group  and Algosaibi by Bloomberg News
weren’t immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
