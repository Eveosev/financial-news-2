Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s
biggest carmaker, aims to sell 500 hybrid Camry sedans a month
in Japan, tapping demand for cars that can run on electricity.  The car will sell at prices from 3.04 million yen ($39,500)
starting today and has fuel economy of 26.5 kilometers per liter
(62 miles a gallon), according to a statement by the company.
That compares with Toyota’s Prius, the world’s best-selling
hybrid car, which gets 38 kilometers per liter.  The redesigned Camry has features to cut drag, including
“aero corners” in front of and behind its wheels. The new
model of the best-selling car in the U.S. for the past nine
years will be offered in  Japan  only in the hybrid version,
according to the statement.  “For Japan, we decided to focus on reducing emissions and
therefore are only releasing a hybrid version,” Keiichi Yoneda,
a Camry engineer, told reporters today in  Tokyo .  The company sold about 1,180 Camrys in Japan last year,
compared with 692,000 globally, led by the U.S. with 327,804.  The redesigned Camry for sale in Japan will be produced at
the company’s Tsutsumi plant in Toyota City, Aichi prefecture.  To contact the reporters on this story:
