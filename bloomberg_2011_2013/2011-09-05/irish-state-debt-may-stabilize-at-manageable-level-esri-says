Ireland’s debt may stabilize at a
“manageable” level after the government won a cut in its
bailout interest rate and the financial system cost less than
anticipated to bail out, the  Economic & Social Research
Institute  said.  The ratio of gross debt to gross domestic product will peak
at about 113 percent next year, the government-funded institute
said today in an e-mailed study. That compares with ranges of
between 118 percent and 121 percent forecast by the  Finance
Ministry  and Ireland’s bailout partners, the  International
Monetary Fund  and the European Union.  “On present plans, the Irish debt burden will stabilize at
a manageable level in 2013 and 2014,” the Dublin-based ESRI
said, adding that “considerable uncertainty remains.”  Ireland’s government in July won a 2 percentage point
reduction in the 5.8 percent interest rate on the 67.5 billion-
euro ($95 billion) bailout accord negotiated last year. In
addition, Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  said on Sept. 1 that
the extra cost of recapitalizing banks was about 17 billion
euros, less than the 35 billion set aside last year.  At the end of 2010, the government also carried so-called
contingent liabilities of 162 billion euros, the ESRI estimates.
These comprise 113 billion euros of bank bonds guaranteed by the
state, 29 billion euros of bonds issued by the National Asset
Management Agency and a net 20 billion euros of emergency
liquidity assistance to the state’s banks.  “In this sense, the state is highly geared,” the ESRI
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
