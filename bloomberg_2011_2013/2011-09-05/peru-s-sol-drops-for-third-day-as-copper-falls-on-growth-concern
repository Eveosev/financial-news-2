Peru’s sol fell for a third day as
copper, the country’s top export, declined amid concern economic
growth may stall in  Europe  and the U.S.  The sol weakened 0.1 percent to 2.7308 per U.S. dollar at
12:07 p.m. New York time, from 2.7280 on Sept. 2.  Copper fell for a third day in London on concern a
deteriorating economic outlook for Europe and the U.S. will cut
demand for industrial metals. U.S. stock futures fell as
European markets showed growing concern the sovereign debt
crisis is worsening. Job growth in the U.S. unexpectedly
stagnated in August, the weakest payrolls reading since
September 2010, government figures showed Sept. 2.  “You have a clear picture on the screens that the world is
going to enter recession again and the  currency market  is
reflecting this view,” said Gonzalo Navarro, head trader at
 Banco Santander  in Lima.  To contact the reporter on this story:
