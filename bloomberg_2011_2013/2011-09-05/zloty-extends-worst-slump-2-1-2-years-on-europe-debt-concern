The zloty declined against the Swiss
franc, capping its biggest five-day slump in 2 1/2 years, and
slid against the euro on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will
worsen and the global recovery is faltering.  Poland ’s currency weakened 1.9 percent to 3.8138 versus the
franc at 4:35 p.m. in Warsaw. The currency has depreciated 8.1
percent in five days, the most since an 8.3 percent tumble ended
Feb. 4, 2009. The zloty slipped 0.6 percent to 4.2139 per euro.  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s party lost weekend
elections in her home state, stoking concern opposition is
growing to bailouts for debt-saddled European nations. and
 Freddie Mac . Citigroup Inc. cut its 2011 global economic growth
forecast today to 3.1 percent from 3.7 percent. U.S. markets are
closed today for the Labor Day holiday.  “The zloty will continue to suffer from negative  market
sentiment  caused by concern over the return of recession in
advanced economies and the worsening debt crisis in the euro
zone,” Bank BPH SA economists led by Maja Goettig in Warsaw
wrote in a note to clients.  The total value of franc-denominated home loans in Poland
reached 162.2 billion zloty ($51.9 billion) at the end of July
and represented 54 percent of all mortgages outstanding,
according to the financial market regulator’s website.  Poland’s public debt won’t breach the 55 percent limit of
public debt to gross domestic product that would force the
government to adopt austerity measures this year as long as the
euro stays below 4.6 zloty, ING Groep NV said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
