The European Commission is planning
steps to rein in growing speculation in raw-material markets,
 Handelsblatt  reported, citing proposals by financial services
commissioner  Michel Barnier .  Investors and traders should be obliged to “prevent market
abuse” and ensure proper pricing of  raw materials  including
wheat, cooking oil and metals, the newspaper said in an article
to be published in tomorrow’s edition, citing a legal blueprint
drawn up by Barnier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
