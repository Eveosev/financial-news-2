Oil extended declines in  New York  as
investors speculated that signs of a weakening U.S. economy and
increasing crude stockpiles indicate fuel demand will falter in
the world’s biggest consumer of the commodity.  Futures slid as much as 3.8 percent before a report today
that may show  service industries  grew at the slowest pace in
more than a year. Crude supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the
delivery point for West Texas Intermediate oil, rose 2.4 percent
on Sept. 1 from Aug. 31, according to DigitalGlobe Inc. London-
traded Brent widened its premium to U.S. prices.  “Oil benchmarks slipped again as fears of slowing global
growth weighed on demand sentiment,”  Mark Pervan , head of
commodity research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.
in  Melbourne , said in a note today. “ Oil prices  should
primarily take direction from equity markets, so expect further
selling pressure this week as markets remain jittery ahead of
major policy discussions.”  Crude for October delivery fell as much as $3.25 to $83.20
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $83.75 at 10:30 a.m. Sydney time. Floor
trading was closed yesterday for the Labor Day holiday and
electronic trades will be booked with today’s transactions for
settlement purposes. The contract slipped 2.8 percent to $86.45
a barrel on Sept. 2. Prices are 12 percent higher the past year.  Brent oil for October settlement was at $110.13, up 5
cents, on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange. The
European benchmark was at a premium of $26.38 to U.S. futures,
compared with a record close of $26.21 on Aug. 19.  Cushing Supplies  Crude stockpiles held in floating-roof tanks at Cushing
rose 850,000 barrels to 35.6 million, satellite images taken by
Longmont, Colorado-based DigitalGlobe show. The Energy
Department said last week that supplies, including floating and
fixed tanks, totaled 33.1 million barrels as of Aug. 26.  The Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing
index fell to 51 last month, the lowest since January 2010, from
52.7 in July, according to the median of 59 forecasts in a
Bloomberg News survey before a release today. Citigroup Inc. cut
its 2011 global economic growth forecast yesterday to 3.1
percent from 3.7 percent.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 benchmark stock index fell 1.2 percent
in Tokyo trading and  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 slid 1.5 percent in
Sydney today as concern that Europe’s debt crisis is worsening
sapped demand for riskier assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
