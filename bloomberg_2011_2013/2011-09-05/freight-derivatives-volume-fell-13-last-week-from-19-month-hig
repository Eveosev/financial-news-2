Trading in freight derivatives, used
to bet on the cost of shipping raw materials such as coal and
iron ore, fell 13 percent last week from a 19-month high.  The number of lots traded totaled 27,318, based on volumes
recorded by Oslo-based NOS Clearing ASA, Singapore-based SGX
AsiaClear and London-based LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd. That’s down
from 31,286 lots for the week to Aug. 26, the most since Jan. 8,
2010, according to the  Baltic Exchange . The Baltic Exchange will
report the latest weekly trading at 6 p.m. in  London . A U.K
holiday on Aug. 29 cut trading to four days last week.  One lot equals one day’s hire of a ship, or 1,000 metric
tons of freight transported.  The Baltic Exchange tallies data from estimates compiled by
member freight derivatives brokers, also based on clearing
volumes reported.  Some 99 percent of freight derivatives are traded
using clearing houses, Baltic Exchange data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
