Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the second-
biggest Japanese automaker in China, may begin making parts for
plug-in hybrid cars in China as it resumes output of its Prius
model in the country.  The automaker hasnâ€™t decided when to start producing the
parts or when it will resume Prius output in China,  Shiori
Hashimoto , a spokeswoman for the company, said by phone today.
Toyota had suspended output of its second-generation Prius in
China in April 2009 for model changes, she said.  Toyota may resume making the prius and begin producing the
parts as early as 2012, after it recently received approval from
Chinese authorities, according to a Kyodo newswire report
carried on the Mainichi Daily News website earlier today.  Toyota fell 2.3 percent to 2,649 yen as of 11 a.m. trading
break in  Tokyo . The benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average declined
1.7 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
