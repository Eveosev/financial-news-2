Stelios Haji-Ioannou  is calling for
the removal of Rigas Doganis from the company’s board, little
more than a week after Deputy Chairman David Michels quit
following the EasyJet founder’s push for his ouster.  Stelios, who is known by his first name, has written to
EasyJet requesting a shareholder vote on dislodging Doganis
after the director backed the purchase of 35 aircraft from
Airbus SAS in January, which the entrepreneur opposes.  “The directors have not identified new routes that these
aircraft can be deployed on profitably,” Stelios said in the
letter that he also distributed in a statement. “The company
will spend up to $3 billion with Airbus and will lose money as a
result of this decision.”  Stelios, who is EasyJet’s biggest stockholder, has clashed
with the board of the Luton, England-based airline since
November 2008, when he called for prudence in spending and
refused to sign off on company accounts. Stelios had also
alleged that the company had infringed on an agreement it had
signed with his EasyGroup holding company.  EasyJet confirmed that it had received the letter from
Stelios, describing the latest proposal as an “unnecessary and
costly distraction,” and said that it would write to investors
urging them to reject the proposal.  “The board believes that this resolution is not about
removing Rigas Doganis as a director of EasyJet but a clear
attempt by a minority shareholder to inappropriately determine
the composition of the board and to override normal corporate
governance protocols,” the company said in a statement.
