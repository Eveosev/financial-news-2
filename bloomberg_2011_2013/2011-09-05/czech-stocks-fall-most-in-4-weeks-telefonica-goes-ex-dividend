Czech stocks fell the most in four
weeks on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen and as
Telefonica Czech Republic AS started trading without the right
to a dividend.  The benchmark PX Index slumped 5.2 percent to 970.8 by the
4:28 p.m. close in Prague, the biggest retreat since Aug. 8 and
the lowest closing level since July 2009. Telefonica, which has
a 20-percent weighting in the index, went ex-dividend today.
Removing the effect of the 40-koruna payout, the stock was
unchanged.  “Concerns have significantly grown in the market” because
of U.S. economic data and Europe’s debt crisis, Levente Blaho
and Akos Herczenik, analysts at Raiffeisen Bank International AG
in Budapest wrote in a research report today.  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s party lost weekend
elections in her home state, stoking concern opposition is
growing to bailouts for debt-saddled European nations. The U.S.
filed 17 lawsuits against banks on Sept. 2 to recover $196
billion spent on mortgage-backed securities bought by  Fannie Mae 
and  Freddie Mac . Citigroup Inc. cut its 2011 global economic
growth forecast today to 3.1 percent from 3.7 percent. U.S.
