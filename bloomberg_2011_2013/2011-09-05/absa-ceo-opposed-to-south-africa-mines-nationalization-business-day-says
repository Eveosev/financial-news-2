Absa Group Ltd. (ASA)  Chief Executive
Officer  Maria Ramos  is opposed to the idea of nationalizing the
countryâ€™s mines, Business Day said, citing Ramos.  Nationalization may not help bring a more equitable
distribution of wealth or create more job opportunities, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper cited her as saying at a conference
in  Cape Town  on Sept. 2. A youth wage subsidy may help school-
leavers into jobs, she was cited as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
