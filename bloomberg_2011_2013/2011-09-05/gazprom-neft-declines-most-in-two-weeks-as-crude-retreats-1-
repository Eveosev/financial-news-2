OAO Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of
Russiaâ€™s gas monopoly, had its biggest fall in more than two
weeks after crude slid below $84 a barrel in  New York .  The stock lost 2.7 percent to 123.87 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, its worst drop since Aug. 19.  Crude for October delivery fell as much as 2.9 percent to
$83.99 a barrel in New York amid signs of economic weakness and
faltering fuel demand in  China  and the U.S., the two biggest
crude consumers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
