Malaysia’s ringgit snapped a three-
day gain on speculation a slowing global economy will deter
policy makers from raising borrowing costs this week.  The central bank will leave the benchmark overnight rate at
3 percent at a Sept. 8 review, according to all 18 economists in
a Bloomberg survey. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index
fell after Labor Department data on Sept. 2 showed employment in
the U.S. stagnated unexpectedly in August and the jobless rate
held at 9.1 percent.  “Worries of a global economic slowdown are reducing risk
appetite,” said Yeo Chin Tiong, head of financial markets at
Alliance Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “The Malaysian currency
will likely trade on a weaker bias.”  The ringgit dropped 0.4 percent to 2.9765 per dollar as of
5.20 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency has gained 1.4 percent this quarter.
Malaysia’s financial markets were closed from Aug. 30 through
Sept. 1.  U.S. payrolls were unchanged last month after an increase
of 85,000 in July. A purchasing managers’ index of non-
manufacturing industries dropped to 57.6 from 59.6 in July, the
China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said last week. A
reading above 50 indicates expansion.  Malaysia’s government bonds fell as the treasury prepares
to sell November 2016 Islamic bonds later this month, according
to its sale calendar. The yield on the 4.262 percent notes due
September 2016 decreased 5 basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 3.40 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
