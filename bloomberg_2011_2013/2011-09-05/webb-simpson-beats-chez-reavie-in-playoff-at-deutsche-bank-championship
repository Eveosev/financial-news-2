Webb Simpson  beat Chez Reavie at the
second hole of a playoff to win golf’s Deutsche Bank
Championship, the second tournament in the U.S. PGA Tour’s
playoffs.  Simpson birdied the final hole of the fourth round to move
to 15-under par and Reavie had a bogey at the 18th to join him
on that mark at the TPC Boston in Norton, Massachusetts, today.  The Deutsche Bank Championship featured the top 100 golfers
in the FedEx Cup standings. The top 70 now advance to the BMW
Championship, which begins Sept. 15 in Lemont,  Illinois , with 30
moving on from there to the season-ending Tour Championship in
Atlanta from Sept. 22-25. The FedEx Cup winner receives a $10
million bonus.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
