Tropical Storm Talas killed 26
people and left 53 missing as the worst cyclone in seven years
pummeled  Japan , knocking out power, roads and bridges, while
record rains caused landslides that swept dozens of houses away.  More than 440,000 people were ordered or advised to
evacuate, the Fire and Disaster Management Agency said. The
government dispatched emergency teams to the Kansai region of
western Japan as the storm brought downpours that flooded rivers
and caused landslides.  About 170 houses are destroyed or damaged and more than
5,400 homes were flooded, according to the FDMA. The heaviest
damage was in Wakayama prefecture south of  Osaka , where four
bridges were destroyed, according to the local emergency
response team. More than 19,000 households remain without power,
the agency said.  In nearby Nara prefecture, 1,652.5 millimeters (65 inches)
of rain fell in the three days through yesterday, a record for a
72-hour period in Japan, Hirotsugu Yamamoto, an official in the
statistical bureau of the  Japan Meteorological Agency  said.  Nearly 27,000 homes in the prefecture were without power
today, according to the Nara emergency response unit.  The storm was the most deadly to hit the country in seven
years, the Yomiuri newspaper said. As many as 98 people were
killed or went missing in a storm in 2004.  The center of Talas, which has weakened to a tropical
depression since earlier today, was over the  Sea of Japan  after
making landfall on Sept. 3 and passing over the islands of
Shikoku and Honshu.  Warnings for heavy rain and landslides remain in effect for
central Honshu and parts of the north, which is still recovering
from the March 11 earthquake and tsunami.  Japan Airlines Co. and All Nippon Airways Co. canceled 332
domestic and international flights, affecting about 31,000
passengers, the carriers said on Sept. 3.  To contact the reporters on this story:
