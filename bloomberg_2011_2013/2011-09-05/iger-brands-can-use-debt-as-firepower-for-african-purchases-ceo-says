Tiger Brands Ltd. (TBS) ,  South Africa ’s
largest food company, said it can boost its levels of debt to
make acquisitions across the continent as it expands outside its
home market.  “We’ve got sufficient firepower to conclude any number of
acquisitions we may want,” Chief Executive Officer Peter
Matlare said in an interview after the company’s annual general
meeting in Johannesburg today. Tiger Brands, which is ungeared
at the moment, has the capacity to increase its net debt to
equity levels to 40 percent, he said.  Over the next three to five years its businesses outside
South Africa will contribute 20 percent to earnings from around
10 percent now, Matlare said. The company looks at “several
acquisition opportunities” with a particular focus on Africa
all the time, he said.  Acquisitions concluded last year in Ethiopia, Cameroon and
 Nigeria  have perfomed to expectations. “But it’s early days
yet,” Matlare said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
