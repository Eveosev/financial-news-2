Hong Kong  stocks fell, driving the
Hang Seng Index to its biggest drop in two weeks after a report
showing U.S. employment growth stalled last month fueled concern
the world’s largest economy may slip into a recession.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a global clothing retailer, dropped
3.2 percent.  Jiangxi Copper  Co., China’s No. 1 producer of the
metal, slumped 4.3 percent and Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. slid
3.5 percent after commodity prices sank.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s
biggest offshore oil explorer, plunged 9 percent after saying a
production halt at a mainland oilfield will lower its net
output.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398)  Ltd. sank 4.7
percent on speculation China may raise reserve-ratio
requirements.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  slipped 3 percent to 19,616.43 at the 4
p.m. close of trading in Hong Kong, the biggest drop since Aug.
19, after a Chinese services index also fell to a record low.
All but one of the 46 stocks on the gauge fell. The Hang Seng
China Enterprises Index of Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong
slid 3.4 percent to 10,299.17.  The U.S. jobs report was “scary,” Dan North, chief U.S.
economist at Euler Hermes ACI in Owings Mills,  Maryland , said in
an interview from  Singapore  with Susan Li on Bloomberg
Television. “When you get to negative job growth, which we’re
very close to now, it means you’re already in a recession.”  In New York, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 2.5
percent on Sept. 2 after a report showed U.S. payrolls were
unchanged in August, the weakest reading since September 2010.
The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey called for an
increase of 68,000. U.S. markets will be closed today for a
public holiday.  Esprit, Cathay  Esprit dropped 3.2 percent to HK$19.02.  Cathay Pacific
Airways Ltd. (293) , the Hong-Kong based international carrier that
counts North America as its biggest market for sales, lost 2.5
percent to HK$15.34.  “The U.S. jobs data was weak across the board and shows
that companies have little confidence to hire,” said Belinda Allen, senior analyst of investment markets research at Colonial
First State Global Asset Management, which oversees about $150
billion. “What this does, however, is bring the  Federal Reserve 
closer to taking action. If that happens, it could help equities
in  Asia  and asset prices generally.”  Commodity shares declined after the London Metal Exchange
Index of prices for six industrial metals including copper and
aluminum fell 1 percent on Sept. 2. Oil for October delivery
slipped as much as 1.9 percent today on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange. The contract dropped 2.8 percent on Sept. 2 after the
U.S. jobs report.  Property Developers  Jiangxi Copper retreated 4.3 percent to HK$21, Aluminum
Corp. fell 3.5 percent to HK$4.92 and PetroChina Co. dropped 3.2
percent to HK$9.36. Cnooc, which also trades without the right
to a dividend today, tumbled 9 percent to HK$13.84 after oil
leaks at a field operated by partner ConocoPhillips forced the
company to cut its output estimate.  Hong Kong property stocks slid today after Land Registry
data on Sept. 2 showed that the number of housing transactions
declined for the eighth straight month in August amid higher
home-loan  interest rates  and government measures to curb prices.
Henderson Land Development Co., a builder controlled by
billionaire Lee Shau-kee, dropped 4 percent to HK$43.15. Rival
 Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. (16)  sank 3 percent to HK$104.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index slid 2.6 percent to 19,530.
The HSI Volatility Index climbed 12 percent to 34.47, indicating
options traders expect a swing of 9.9 percent in the Hang Seng
Index in the next 30 days.  Chinese Banks  Industrial & Commercial Bank fell 4.7 percent to HK$4.88,
leading declines among Chinese lenders after the China
Securities Journal said new reserve requirements for 14 listed
banks may increase by about 700 billion yuan ($110 billion) over
the next six months.  China Construction Bank Corp. (939)  lost 3.7
percent to HK$5.53.  ZTE Corp. (000063) , a Chinese mobile-phone-equipment maker, slumped
4 percent to HK$20.30 after a purchasing managers’ index for the
services industry slid to 50.6 in August from 53.5 in July,
according to a report by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics.
 China  Coal Energy Co., a mainland coal producer, dropped 3.3
percent to A$9.64  Both ZTE and China Coal are included in the Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index, and declined even after Societe Generale SA
in a note dated Sept. 2 raised its rating on Chinese companies
listed in Hong Kong to “overweight” on speculation the nation
will stop tightening monetary policy. The brokerage had told
investors to “underweight” the stocks since January.  To contact the reporters on this story:
