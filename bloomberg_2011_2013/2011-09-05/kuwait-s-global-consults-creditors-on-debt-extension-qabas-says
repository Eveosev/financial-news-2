Global Investment House KSCC (GLOBAL) , which
restructured $1.73 billion of debt in 2009, started initial
talks with creditors on the possibility of extending debt
repayments,  Al-Qabas  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Consultations began “after it became difficult” for
Global to commit to an agreement reached with 53 creditors in
December 2009 to reorganize debt, and could be affected by an
expected court ruling on a dispute with National Bank of Umm Al-
Qaiwain, the newspaper said.  Global Investment representatives weren’t immediately
available for comment when contacted by Bloomberg News today.  Global, Kuwait’s biggest investment bank, said in April
that a Dubai court ruled in its favor in a $250 million dispute
with National Bank of Umm Al-Qaiwain. The United Arab Emirates-
based bank was ordered to pay the amount plus an interest of
$54.6 million, Global said at the time. The execution awaits a
final ruling of Dubai’s Court of Cassation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
