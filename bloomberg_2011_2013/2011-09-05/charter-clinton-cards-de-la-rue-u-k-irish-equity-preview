U.K. stocks declined for a second
day, led by banking shares, amid concern Europe’s sovereign-debt
crisis will worsen.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  and  Barclays Plc (BARC)  fell more
than 6 percent.  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO)  slid 5.2 percent as Citigroup
Inc. advised selling shares of the copper producer.  The FTSE 100 fell 189.45 points, or 3.6 percent, to
5,102.58 at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London . The measure slumped
7.2 percent last month, the most since February 2009, as concern
that the global economic recovery is faltering and Europe’s
sovereign debt crisis is spreading wiped more than $300 billion
off the value of U.K. shares. The FTSE All-Share Index dropped 3
percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index declined 3.1 percent.  “There is a serious risk of a further escalation of the
crisis,”  Tammo Greetfeld , a Munich-based equity strategist at
UniCredit SpA wrote in a report. “We remain underweight euro
zone equities and reiterate our cautious stance.”  The FTSE 100 climbed 3.2 percent last week after the August
slump dragged equities to their cheapest price-to-earnings ratio
since March 2009.  RBS slid 12 percent to 21.78 pence. Barclays lost 6.7
percent to 154.15 pence. Bank stocks declined across western
 Europe  after 17 lenders, including RBS and Barclays, were sued
by the U.S. over the sale of mortgage-backed securities and on
continuing investor concern over interbank lending.  ‘Risk’  “This is really about fears about liquidity and solvency
now,” said Andrew Lim, a banking analyst at Espirito Santo
Investment Bank. “U.S. money markets are lending less for a
second month to European banks, particularly French banks. Banks
are having to come back to the market to complete their 2011
borrowing programs and if they fail in that respect that’s going
to create a lot of risk.”  Antofagasta retreated 5.2 percent to 1,233 pence as
Citigroup downgraded the shares to “sell” from “hold.”  Berkeley Group Holdings Plc (BKG)  rallied 4.8 percent to 1,236
pence as the U.K.’s largest homebuilder by market value said it
may reach a goal of doubling pretax profit two years earlier
than forecast as sales improved.  To contact the reporters on this story:
