Japanese stocks fell for a third
day, pushing the benchmark  Nikkei 225  Stock Average to the
lowest close since April 2009, as Europe’s worsening debt crisis
saps demand for riskier assets.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) ,  Japan ’s biggest
lender, fell 2.7 percent after the cost of insuring against
default on European sovereign and financial debt surged to
records.  Toshiba Corp. (6502) , Japan’s largest maker of nuclear  power
plants , sank 5.1 percent after a newspaper said the company is
in talks to buy Shaw Group’s 20 percent stake in Westinghouse
Electric, a reactor builder. Kansai Electric Power Co., a
nuclear-power operator, jumped 3.5 percent after Japan’s new
prime minister indicated his support for atomic energy.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 2.2 percent to 8,590.57,
its lowest close since April 28, 2009, as of 3 p.m. in Tokyo.
The broader Topix index dropped 1.9 percent to 741.20, the
lowest close since March 13, 2009.  “ Europe ’s situation is dire because it’s unclear if  Greece 
will get a second round of aid,” said Koichi Kurose, chief
economist in Tokyo at Resona Bank Ltd. “Japanese stocks are
falling amid a rout in global equities, and we have yet to see
the bottom.”  The Nikkei 225 has lost about 16 percent this year amid
concern U.S. growth is sputtering and Europe’s debt crisis will
damage the banking system, damping demand in two of Japan’s
biggest export markets. Stocks in Japan’s benchmark are valued
at 14 times estimated earnings on average, compared with 11.7
times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 9.3 times for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Toyota, Canon  Electric appliance makers, carmakers and banks contributed
the most to the Topix’ losses.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s
biggest carmaker, dropped 1.3 percent to 2,605 yen.  Canon Inc. (7751) ,
the world’s biggest camera maker, declined 1.6 percent to 3,450
yen. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group fell 2.7 percent to 325 yen.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 4.1 percent to 223.45
yesterday, with all 19 industry groups falling. It has suffered
its biggest two-day drop since March 2009. Standard & Poor’s 500
Index futures expiring in September retreated 2.5 percent today.
U.S. stock markets were closed yesterday for the Labor Day
holiday.  An election loss for German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s
party and reports of a rift between Greece and the  International
Monetary Fund  fueled concern that support for bailing out
indebted European nations is waning. A senior IMF economist
forecast a “hard default” for Greece by March, the Wall Street
Journal said, as officials suspended a budget review and  Italy 
backtracked on its austerity pledges.  ‘ Risk Aversion ’  “Uncertainty in Europe and the U.S. is getting strong, as
U.S. jobs data deteriorated and Europe’s debt crisis spread,”
said Yumi Nishimura, an equity-market analyst at Daiwa
Securities Capital Markets Co. in  Tokyo . “Investors have
entered a short phase of risk aversion.”  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments rose 18 basis points to 328 at 5
p.m. in  London  yesterday. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index
linked to senior debt of 25 banks and insurers soared 24 basis
points to 270, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. Both gauges are
at all-time highs based on closing prices.  Toshiba fell 5.1 percent to 297 yen, the lowest close since
April 2009. The company is in talks to purchase Shaw Group’s 20
percent stake in Westinghouse Electric, a nuclear reactor
builder 77 percent owned by Toshiba, the Wall Street Journal
reported on its website.  Utilities rose, with  Kansai Electric  jumping 3.5 percent to
1,429 yen, after Japan’s new Prime Minister, Yoshihiko Noda, in
his first days in office signaled that atomic power is needed to
save the economy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
