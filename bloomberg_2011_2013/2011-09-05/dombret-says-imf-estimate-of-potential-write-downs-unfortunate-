Bundesbank board member Andreas Dombret said calculations by the  International Monetary Fund  of
potential bank write-downs in  Europe  as a result of the region’s
debt crisis are “extremely unfortunate.”  “Such simulations, even if they’re still in a draft stage,
are in my eyes causing more damage than benefit,” Dombret said
in a speech in Frankfurt today. “With this doomsday scenario,
the IMF couldn’t have thought of German banks.”  A draft of the IMF’s Global Financial Stability Report
estimates that euro-area banks face damages to their balance
sheets of as much as 200 billion euros ($283 billion) from
holding Irish, Greek, Portuguese, Italian, Spanish and Belgian
sovereign debt, the Financial Times reported last week. That
would be a drop of 10 percent to 12 percent in the banks’
tangible common equity, the core measure of their capital bases,
the newspaper added.  Global regulators must agree on an “internationally
consistent” framework to wind down systemically important
financial institutions, Dombret said.  “In a free market economy, the collapse of a financial
institution cannot and should not be entirely excluded,” he
said. “The virtue of systemic relevance mustn’t be tantamount
to ‘too big to fail’.”  Dombret also said he’s skeptical about introducing a
financial transaction tax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
