Sweden will postpone planned tax
cuts for pensioners until as late as 2014, and will only push
through such measures at that time if public finances are
balanced,  the government said .  The cuts will be prioritized over other income tax
reductions, Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt and the leaders of
the three other government parties wrote in an opinion piece
published today in newspaper Dagens Nyheter.  Reinfeldtâ€™s minority coalition government last year said it
wants to reduce taxes for pensioners for a fourth time by 2014,
having already cut levies by a combined 12.8 billion kronor ($2
billion) since coming to power in 2006.  The government on Aug. 26 cut its forecast for public
finances, and now expects a balanced budget next year, versus an
earlier prediction of a 1.8 percent surplus of gross domestic
product.  To contact the reporter on this story:
