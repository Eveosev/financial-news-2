Swiss stocks retreated, led by
financial stocks, after the U.S. sued 17 banks to recoup $196
billion spent on mortgage-backed securities bought by  Fannie Mae 
and  Freddie Mac .  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , Switzerland’s second-biggest bank,
sank 8.1 percent.  Clariant AG (CLN) , the world’s biggest maker of
printing-ink chemicals, plunged 16 percent after cutting
earnings and sales targets.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI) , a measure of the biggest and most
actively traded companies, fell 4 percent to 5,142.99 at the
5:30 p.m. close in Zurich as all 20 shares in the gauge
declined. The SMI has tumbled 23 percent from this year’s high
on Feb. 18 as the Swiss franc’s strength curbed exports and
concern mounted that the global recovery is stalling. The
broader Swiss Performance Index declined 4.1 percent today.  The U.S. lawsuit “is reinforcing the downward trend on the
financial sector,” said John Plassard, a director at Louis
Capital Markets in Geneva. “It’s worrisome. With Clariant, we
see the vigor of the Swiss franc hitting Swiss stocks. It’s the
hard reality, and we’ll see other companies that will experience
the same thing.”  Credit Suisse, among the lenders sued by the U.S., dropped
8.1 percent to 19.99 francs. The Federal Housing Finance Agency,
on behalf of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, filed 17 lawsuits in
New York state and federal courts and in federal court in
Connecticut on Sept. 3. The FHFA accuses the banks of misleading
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac about the soundness of the mortgages
underlying the securities.  Europe Banks Skid  European banks tumbled 5.9 percent on the Stoxx Europe 600
after German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party yesterday suffered
its fifth election defeat this year ahead of a ruling in
Germany’s constitutional court on Wednesday on the country’s
participation in euro zone bailouts.  UBS AG (UBSN) , Switzerland’s largest bank, lost 6.5 percent to
10.32 francs.  Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER) , the country’s fifth-
biggest wealth manager, slid 6.9 percent to 28.79 francs.  Clariant tumbled 16 percent to 6.95 francs. The company,
which purchased a German catalyst maker for $1.5 billion in
April, cut targets for sales and profitability this year after a
demand slowdown in some markets and the franc’s gain.  Full-year sales are now seen at 7 billion francs ($8.9
billion) to 7.2 billion francs, down from an earlier range of
7.8 billion francs to 8 billion francs, the company said.
Clariant lowered its margin target range to 12.8 percent to 13.2
percent from an earlier 13.5 percent to 14.5 percent.  Lonza, Syngenta Retreat  Chemical makers retreated.  Lonza Group AG (LONN) , the world’s
biggest maker of drug ingredients, slid 5.9 percent to 47.92
francs.  Syngenta AG (SYNN) , the largest maker of agricultural
chemicals, dropped 4.4 percent to 238.50 francs.  Givaudan SA (GIVN) ,
maker of the fragrances of Marc Jacobs’s Lola and Paco Rabanne’s
1 Million perfumes, retreated 3.3 percent to 735 francs.  “Due to Clariant’s comment of a softening of demand, we
expect all chemical-share prices to suffer today,” Markus Mayer, European chemicals analyst at UniCredit Research in
Munich, wrote in a note.  The sub-index of chemical stocks in the Stoxx Europe 600
Index lost 4.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
