Junk bonds  are heading for their
worst quarter in almost three years as Europe’s spreading
deficit crisis drives investors out of the riskiest debt.  Speculative-grade bonds in the region lost 6.4 percent
since the start of the third quarter, the most since they lost
22.7 percent in the final quarter of 2008, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data. August is the third
consecutive month this year that investors in European junk-
rated bonds lost money, the data show.  Concern that a slowing economy will drain corporate
earnings prompted investors to pull $280 million from European
high-yield funds last week, bringing withdrawals to $2.5 billion
in 2011, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch research
citing Cambridge, Massachusetts-based EPFR Global. Gross
domestic product in the 17-nation euro region rose 0.2 percent
in the second quarter, the worst performance since it emerged
from recession in 2009.  “There are few consoling words with the high-yield market
reflecting the general feeling in investment-grade and other
risky asset markets,”  Suki Mann , the head of credit strategy at
Societe Generale SA in  London , wrote in a note to clients Sept.
2. “It’s going to be a very, very long road back for the high-
yield market.”  Bond Returns  European junk bonds returned 14.7 percent in 2010. The debt
lost 6.4 percent in August, after losing 0.5 percent in July and
1.6 percent in June, the Bank of America Merrill Lynch data
show. High-yield, or junk, bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and BBB- by  Standard & Poor’s .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed 27 basis
points to 721 today, the highest since July 2009, according
JPMorgan Chase & Co. An increase signals deteriorating
perceptions of  credit quality .  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.1 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  Junk bond issuance rose to a record 32 billion euros in the
first half of 2011 as companies’ efforts to cut leverage and
improve liquidity kept defaults close to 1 percent, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The global default rate will
increase to 1.8 percent in 2012 as the risk of recession
persists, Moody’s said Aug. 8.  Sales of high-yield bonds by  Europe ’s corporate borrowers
ground to a halt in August. Italian plastic and glass packaging
maker Bormioli Rocco Holdings SA’s sale of 250 million euros of
bonds July 26 was the last by a speculative-grade company,
Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
