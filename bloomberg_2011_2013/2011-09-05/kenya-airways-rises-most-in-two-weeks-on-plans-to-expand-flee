Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL) , sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s third-largest airline, rose the most two weeks after
announcing plans to expand its fleet starting next year,
enabling the company to introduce new routes.  The stock rose 1.5 shillings, or 5 percent, to 31.5
shillings by 1:12 p.m. in Nairobi, the capital.  The company agreed to buy 10 aircraft from the Embraer SA
and signed an option to acquire another 16 from the Brazilian
manufacturer, Chief Executive Officer Titus Naikuni said Aug.
30.  “Kenya Airways is rising because of new aircraft, the
company is expanding,” Vimal Parmar, a researcher with Kestrel
Capital East Africa Ltd., said by phone from Nairobi today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
