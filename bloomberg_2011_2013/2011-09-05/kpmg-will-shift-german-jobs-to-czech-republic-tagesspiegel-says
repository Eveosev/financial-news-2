KPMG LP plans to shift jobs from
 Germany  to the  Czech Republic  as part of a move to concentrate
internal services in a few European locations,  Tagesspiegel 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Some 180 German jobs will be lost, with the human resources
and financial services units and the Berlin office particularly
affected, the newspaper said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
