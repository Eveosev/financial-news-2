Poland’s antitrust regulator
approved  Liberty Global Inc. (LBTYA) ’s purchase of Aster Sp. z o.o. on
the condition that it sell parts of the network that overlap in
Warsaw and Krakow.  Liberty, which already owns Aster rival UPC Polska Sp. z
o.o., would have a combined market share in the two cities of
between 50 percent and 60 percent, the watchdog said in a
statement distributed in the Polish capital today. It will have
to reduce its control of the markets to no more than 40 percent.  Liberty, the cable company controlled by billionaire  John Malone , agreed to buy Aster from Mid Europa Partners LLP for
about 2.4 billion zloty ($805 million), the U.S.-based company
said on Dec. 6. Liberty agreed to pay the private equity company
870 million zloty and assume debt of 1.53 billion zloty.  Aster, which operates mainly in Warsaw and Krakow, had
368,000 TV subscribers, 177,000 Internet customers and 70,000
users of its phone services on Sept. 30, Liberty said in the
statement.  UPC is the largest cable TV operator in  Poland , with 1.1
million customers, according to Liberty’s website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
