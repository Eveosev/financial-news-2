Arcelik AS (ARCLK) ,  Europe â€™s third-largest
home appliances maker, will either buy a company or set up a
production plant in  Australia ,  Sabah  reported, citing Arcelik
deputy executive Tulin Karabuk.  The Istanbul-based company may also invest in other
Southeast Asian markets, Karabuk said, according to the
newspaper.  Arcelik hired Michael Goadby from Fisher & Paykel
Appliances Holding to head its Australian operations last month,
the newspaper said.  Arcelik got 51 percent of its 6.9 billion liras ($4.2
billion) of sales in 2010 from its international sales, Karabuk
told Sabah.  To contact the reporter on this story:
