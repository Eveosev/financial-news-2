The Philippine peso fell, snapping a
three-day gain, as concern global growth is weakening prompted
investors to sell emerging-market assets.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of stocks slumped to a one-week
low after a Sept. 2 report showed U.S. payrolls were unchanged
in August at the lowest level since September 2010. Bonds gained
on expectations the central bank will delay increases in
borrowing costs. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has “greater
flexibility” to keep its benchmark  interest rate  unchanged at
4.5 percent after growth slowed, Deputy Governor Diwa Guinigundo
said Sept 3.  “There’s a little bit of  risk aversion  on worries about
global economic growth with the bad economic data in the U.S.,”
said Rafael Algarra, treasurer at Security Bank Corp. in Manila.
Traders with short positions that profit from declines in the
dollar against Asian currencies may have trimmed some of their
bets, he said.  The peso slid 0.2 percent to 42.235 per dollar as of 9:59
a.m. in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc.  Growth in the  Philippines ’ $200 billion economy slowed in
the second quarter to 3.4 percent, compared with a 4.6 percent
gain in the first quarter. The central bank will leave its
overnight borrowing rate unchanged on Sept. 8, according to all
10 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  The yield on the 7 percent government bonds due January
2016 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 4.48
percent, according to Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
