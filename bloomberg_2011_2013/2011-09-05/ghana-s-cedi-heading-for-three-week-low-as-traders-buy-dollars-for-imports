Ghana ’s cedi headed for the lowest
in three weeks against the dollar as traders bought the U.S.
currency to import goods for resale in West Africa’s second-
biggest economy.  The currency of the world’s second-largest cocoa producer
depreciated 0.2 percent to 1.5315 per dollar as of 12:17 p.m. in
Accra, the capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A
close at this level will be the weakest since Aug. 15.  “Dollar purchases from the commerce industry were the main
movers of the market today,” Biggles Amponsah, a currency
trader at the local unit of Access Bank Plc, said in a telephone
interview. “The traders commanded the bulk of demand for the
imports of assorted goods for resale in Ghana.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
