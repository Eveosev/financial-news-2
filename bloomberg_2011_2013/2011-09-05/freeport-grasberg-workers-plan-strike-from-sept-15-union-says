Workers at  Freeport-McMoRan Copper &
Gold Inc. (FCX) ’s Grasberg mine in  Indonesia ’s Papua province may hold
another strike from Sept. 15 should the company fail to make a
new offer on wages increases, a labor union official said.  “We decided to give the management time to change their
offer,” Virgo Solossa, head of organizational affairs at  PT
Freeport Indonesia’s  labor union, said by telephone today from
Timika, Papua. “If there’s no solution, then we will strike.”  Freeport and Grasberg mine’s labor union ended talks over
2011-2013 contract terms on Aug. 26 after failing to reach an
agreement on wage increases. The two sides started negotiations
on July 20 after about 8,000 workers put down tools for eight
days to July 11, disrupting production and helping to drive up
copper prices.  Freeport expected to continue discussions with its
employees because under Indonesian law they can extend their
talks by 30 days if they want to, Ramdani Sirait, a Jakarta-
based spokesman at Freeport, said on Aug. 26.  “We give room for the management to maximize their stance
and if possible to match our demands,” Solossa said. “We’re
waiting for their response. If they change the offer, then we
will definitely meet again. If not, then why should we meet?”  The workers have cut their wage expectations between $17.50
and $43 an hour, from $35 to $200 an hour initially, he said on
Aug. 26. The employees currently get $1.50 to $3.50 an hour.  Compensation Package  “There is no legal basis for any form of work stoppage
that is considered a strike as the laws provide for sustained
dialogue and mediation,” Freeport’s Sirait said by e-mail today.
“During the negotiations, management has offered an attractive
financial package for improving the welfare of employees for the
upcoming period of the Collective Labor Agreement from October
2011 to September 2013.”  The compensation package includes an increase to basic
wages for non-staff employees of 22 percent over the two-year
period and bigger bonuses of as much as 230 percent for higher
metal output, and a savings plan contribution of as much as 4
percent, he said.  “The package when annualized will amount to 26 times the
basic monthly wage, excluding overtime,” Sirait said.  A strike at Grasberg can potentially widen a global
production shortfall of copper estimated at 670,000 metric tons
this year by  Barclays Capital  and boost prices of the metal in
 London  that have fallen more than 11 percent from a record
$10,190 a ton on Feb. 15.  Grasberg, where operations started in 1990, contains the
world’s largest recoverable reserves of copper and the biggest
 gold reserves , according to Freeport’s website. Copper
production at the mine fell to 1.22 billion pounds (553.4
million kilograms) last year from 1.41 billion pounds in 2009,
according to the website. Gold output declined to 1.79 million
ounces (50,745 kilograms) from 2.57 million ounces.  Copper for three-month delivery dropped 0.6 percent to
$9,020 a ton on the London Metal Exchange at 3:21 p.m. Jakarta
time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
