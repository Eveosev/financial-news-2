Supplies of cocoa are
“comfortable” until the end of the year as crops expanded and
demand for chocolate in  Europe  isn’t growing, said Christian
Walter, managing director of Ferrero SpA’s U.K. division.  Cocoa supplies will exceed demand by a record 325,000
metric tons in the current crop year, according to the London-
based International Cocoa Organization. The crop in  Ghana , the
world’s second-largest producer, exceeded 1 million tons, a
record, the Ghana Cocoa Board said on Aug. 26.  “Chocolate demand is not growing in Europe this year,”
Walter said in an interview at an industry fair in London today.
“We just had the biggest crop ever in Ghana.”  The surplus in cocoa production this year will be more than
enough to make up for a possible shortage next season starting
Oct. 1, because cocoa can be stored for at least two years under
the right conditions, Walter said.  Cocoa for December delivery fell 8 pounds, or 0.4 percent,
to 1,943 pounds ($3,129) a ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
