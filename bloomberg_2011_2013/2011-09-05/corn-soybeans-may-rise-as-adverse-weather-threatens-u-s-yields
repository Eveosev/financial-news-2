Corn and soybeans may rise this week
on speculation that a government report on Sept. 12 will
forecast smaller U.S. crops after a heat wave in July and dry
weather in August eroded yield prospects.  Twenty-two of 29 traders and analysts surveyed from  Tokyo 
to  Chicago  on Sept. 2 forecast that corn will rise for a fifth
time in six weeks, and 23 respondents said soybeans will gain
for a fourth straight week.  On the Chicago Board of Trade last week, corn futures for
December delivery fell 0.9 percent to $7.60 a bushel. Soybean
futures for November delivery rose 1.6 percent to $14.4575 a
bushel, after prices reached the highest since July 2008.  Last weekâ€™s gain in soybeans was expected by the majority
of analysts and traders surveyed on Aug. 26, while the drop in
corn was a surprise.  Bullish on corn: 22    Bullish on soybeans: 23
Bearish on corn:  7    Bearish on soybeans:  6  To contact the reporter on this story:
