Middle East oil for sale to  Asia  was
little changed as refiners waited for new official prices from
Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. cut posted prices.  Murban, produced by Abu Dhabi National Oil, for November
loading remained at a premium of 6 cents a barrel to its
official selling price, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Lower Zakum, also produced in the emirate, was at a premium of 1
cent a barrel, Bloomberg data showed.  Saudi Arabia is expected to increase its listed selling
prices for October crude amid signs that refiners in China and
 Japan  are increasing their demand.  “The market is eagerly waiting for more direction from
Aramco’s latest set of official selling prices,” said Vienna-
based analysts at JBC Energy GmbH in their weekly Asian report.  Saudi Arabia  may raise its Arab Light listed prices for
October by about 55 cents, and Extra Light may increase by 45
cents, according to a Bloomberg News survey of six Asian
refiners and analysts. The prices may be released later today.  Abu Dhabi National Oil cut the official selling prices for
August-loading cargos for all of its four export grades, the
company said in a statement e-mailed to refiners. Murban, the
emirate’s biggest crude by volume, was cut 4.3 percent from July
to $109.05 a barrel. It is at a $4.03 premium to the price Dubai
published via Platts for the same period, according to Bloomberg
calculations.  Oman crude for immediate loading fell $2.10, or 1.9
percent, to $106.91 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai oil
for delivery in November fell 1.9 percent to $106.48. Murban
dropped 1.9 percent to $110.50.  Oman futures for November delivery dropped $1.17 to $106.88
a barrel on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange at 5:23 p.m. Singapore
time, with 1,108 contracts traded. The settlement price was
$107.08 at 1:03 p.m. in Dubai.  The October Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European marker contract against the Persian Gulf grade,
narrowed 2 cents to $5.28 a barrel, according to data from PVM
Oil Associates, a broker. The exchange for swaps for November
fell 4 cents to $4.58.  To contact the reporter on this story:
