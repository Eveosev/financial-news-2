At least 16 people were killed and
11 wounded in Nigeria’s central city of  Jos  in reprisal clashes
between Christian and Muslim ethnic groups yesterday, said Pam
Ayuba, spokesman for the Plateau state government.  Hundreds of women and youth barricaded the highway between
Abuja, the capital, and Jos today to protest renewed violence
between the groups, Ayuba said by phone from the city.  A family of four was killed in the predominately Christian
district of Dabwak and 12 people died in an attack in the suburb
of Babale, Ayuba said. On Sept. 3, unknown gunmen killed a
family of eight in Jos, he said.  Nearly 70 people have been killed in Plateau state in less
than two weeks in the latest violence between Christians and
Muslims. Nigeria,  Africa ’s top oil producer and most populous
nation of about 140 million people, is roughly split between a
mainly Muslim north and a predominantly Christian south.  The military deployed to maintain peace are “now mandated
to use all the necessary force within its powers on anybody
carrying and using arms or dangerous weapons,” after soldiers
came under sniper attack on Sept. 2, Charles Ekeocha, a
spokesman for the military  task force  in the area, said today by
phone from the city.  More than 14,000 people died in ethnic and religious
clashes in the West African nation between 1999 and 2009,
according to the Brussels-based  International Crisis Group .  To contact the reporter on this story:
