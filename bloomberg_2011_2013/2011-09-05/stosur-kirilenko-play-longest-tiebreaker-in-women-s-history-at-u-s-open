Samantha Stosur and  Maria Kirilenko 
played the longest tiebreaker in women’s Grand Slam history in
their fourth-round match tonight at the  U.S. Open .  Stosur, the ninth seed from  Australia , and Kirilenko, the
25th seed from  Russia , had a 32-point tiebreaker in the second
set of their match -- which is now in the third set.  Stosur, who won the first set 6-2, wasted five match points
in the tiebreaker. Kirilenko finally won the set, 7-6 (17-15) on
her sixth set point.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
