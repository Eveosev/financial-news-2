India ’s rupee fell by the most in
more than a week after overseas investors pulled money from
local stocks on slowing growth and accelerating inflation.  The currency slid 4.1 percent in August, the biggest
monthly decline since May 2010, as foreign investors sold $2.3
billion more Indian shares than they bought, exchange data show.
Food inflation accelerated to a four-month high of 10.05 percent
in the week ended Aug. 20 from a year earlier, a government
report showed last week. The economy expanded 7.7 percent in the
second quarter, the least since 2009, according to a report
released Aug. 30.  “There is pressure on the currency because of outflows of
dollars from the equities market,” said Vikas Babu, a currency
trader at state-owned  Andhra Bank  in Mumbai. “We are expecting
inflation to stay high, which is likely to dent economic
growth.”  The rupee weakened 0.4 percent to 45.99 per dollar at the 5
p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg,
the biggest decline since Aug. 24. Food inflation data for the
week ended Aug. 27 are due Sept. 8.  India’s services industry grew at the slowest pace in more
than two years in August, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
said in an e-mailed statement today. Manufacturing output
increased at the slowest pace in 29 months, a report showed last
week.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 46.37 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 46.31
at the end of last week. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
