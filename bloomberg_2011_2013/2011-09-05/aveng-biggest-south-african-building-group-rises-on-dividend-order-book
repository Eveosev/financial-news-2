Aveng Ltd. (AEG) ,  South Africa ’s largest
construction and engineering company, rose in Johannesburg
trading after its order book increased and the company
maintained its dividend.  The shares closed 0.7 percent higher at 33.52 rand as of
5 p.m. The benchmark FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index declined
2.1 percent.  The order book rose 19 percent to a record high of 37
billion rand ($5.2 billion), the Johannesburg-based company said
in a statement. More than half of the order book is from
Australasia, Chief Executive Officer Roger Jardine said by phone
from Johannesburg today. Aveng will pay a final dividend of 1.45
rand for the year through June, the same amount as a year
earlier.  “The nice, stable dividend and the positive order book,”
is helping to boost the shares, Dirk Noeth, an analyst at Avior
Research Ltd., said by phone from  Cape Town .  Aveng increased capital expenditure by 54 percent to 1.82
billion rand in the year and had cash of 5.4 billion rand at the
year end.  To contact the reporter on this story:
