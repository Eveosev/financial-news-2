The FTSE/JSE  Africa  All Share Index
declined for a second day, dropping 630.78, or 2.1 percent, to
29,888.14 by the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  Anglo American Plc (AGL)  , the mining company that makes
up about 9 percent of the benchmark  stock index , fell the most
in more than two weeks, sliding 9.35 rand, or 3.3 percent, to
273 rand. Copper fell for a third day in  London  to the lowest
price in more than a week on concern slumping economies may
reduce demand.          BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  , the world’s largest mining
group, dropped for a third day, declining 2.3 percent to 222.59
rand. The group was downgraded to “hold” from “buy” at
Investec by equity analyst Mark Heyhoe, with a 12-month price
estimate of 21.74 pounds per share. The shares commenced trading
today without the right to its latest dividend.  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS SJ), the world’s biggest
producer of the metal, fell the most in more than 15 months,
slumping 30.07 rand, or 5.4 percent, to 528.08 rand. Slowing
global growth could lead to less demand for the metal, which is
used for pollution-control devices for cars,  Leon Esterhuizen ,
an analyst at  RBC Capital Markets , said by phone from London.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  , Africa’s biggest producer
of the metal, rose to a two-week high, gaining 6.82 rand, or 2.1
percent, to 328.95 rand. Gold rose above $1,900 an ounce in
London as concern about slowing economic growth and  Europe ’s
debt woes spurred demand for a protection of wealth.  Harmony Gold Mining Co. (HAR SJ), Africa’s third-largest
gold company, added 50 cents, or 0.5 percent, to 97.25 rand.  Aveng Ltd. (AEG)  , the country’s largest construction
company, advanced for the first time in three days, rising 24
cents, or 0.7 percent, to 33.52 rand. The group said its order
book grew 19 percent to 37 billion rand ($5.2 billion).  AVI Ltd. (AVI)  ,  South Africa ’s third-largest consumer
goods company, declined the most in almost two weeks, falling 65
cents, or 2 percent, to 32.10 rand. The company said profit
climbed 36 percent in the year through June, missing analyst
estimates.  Palabora Mining Co. Ltd. (PAM SJ), a copper producer,
closed at its lowest in more than three weeks, declining 3.22
rand, or 2.3 percent, to 139.51 rand. Rio Tinto Group and Anglo
American, which together own about three-quarters of Palabora
Mining, said they plan to sell their entire holdings in the
South African miner as it no longer fits their investment
objectives.  To contact the reporter on this story:
