Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France
advanced to the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open with a five-set
win over  Mardy Fish , who was the highest-seeded American man at
the season’s final major tennis tournament.  Tsonga, seeded 11th, was a 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 3-6, 6-4, 6-2
winner over eighth-seeded Fish at the National Tennis Center in
New York. Tsonga advances to a final eight meeting against No. 3
Roger Federer of Switzerland or Juan Monaco of Argentina.  With Fish’s loss at Arthur Ashe Stadium, three Americans
remain in the U.S. Open men’s draw.  Andy Roddick , John Isner and
Donald Young all play fourth-round matches tomorrow.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
