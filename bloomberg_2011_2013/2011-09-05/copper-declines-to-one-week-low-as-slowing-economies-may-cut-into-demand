Copper fell to a one-week low in
London on speculation slumping economies will reduce demand.  An index of investor confidence in the euro region declined
to a two-year low this month, Limburg, Germany Sentix said
today. The  MSCI World (MXWO)  Index of shares fell 2.1 percent today.  “It’s more just the feeling that the macro outlook is
weaker,”  Jim Lennon , global head of commodities research at
Macquarie Group Ltd. in London, said by phone.  Copper for three-month delivery declined $116, or 1.3
percent, to $8,960 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange,
the lowest closing price since Aug. 24. Copper for December
delivery dropped 6.35 percent, or 1.5 percent, to $4.061 a pound
on the Comex in  New York  by 6:40 p.m. in London.  Prices fell after German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party
suffered its fifth election loss this year following a campaign
based on her handling of the euro-area debt crisis.  Germany ’s
top constitutional court will rule on Sept. 7 in three cases
challenging the country’s participation in a bailout of Greece
and the euro-area rescue fund.  “Focus this week is likely to switch to the EU debt
situation again as Germany’s government is voting on the EU
bailout fund,”  William Adams , an analyst at Basemetals.com in
London, wrote in a report.  Stronger Dollar  Metals also declined as the U.S. Dollar Index headed for
its longest winning streak since January, making dollar-priced
commodities more expensive in terms of other monies.  Nickel for three-month delivery on the LME led declines
among the six main metals traded on the exchange, falling 2.8
percent to $20,895 a ton. Zinc retreated 1.1 percent to $2,172 a
ton, the lowest settlement since Aug. 22.  Aluminum dropped 2 percent to $2,387.50 a ton, lead slid 1
percent to $2,435 a ton and tin fell 1.2 percent to $23,950 a
ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
