Dowa Holdings Co. (5714) ,  Japan ’s biggest
silver producer, will raise output 40 percent this year to meet
solar-cell demand after the 2011 Fukushima disaster crippled a
nuclear power plant and sent fossil fuel costs higher.  The Tokyo-based company plans to produce 500 metric tons of
silver in the year that began April 1 from 357 tons in the
previous year, said Hiromitsu Takagi, manager of the strategic
planning and public relations department at Dowa Holdings. That
would be the most since 2006, the company said.  Japan is expected to become the largest solar market after
 China  this year, according to estimates by Bloomberg New Energy
Finance, or BNEF. The forecast reflects the push by Japan to
find alternative sources of energy following the earthquake and
tsunami, which prompted the shutdown of all but two of the
nation’s nuclear reactors. A rise in demand may support silver,
which entered a  bear market  on April 2.  “We could increase silver output following an increase in
silver-ore imports from suppliers such  Chile ,” Takagi said in
an interview on May 10.  Silver has dropped 22 percent this year. The metal, which
reached a 2 1/2-year low on April 16, is the worst performer in
Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities, which retreated
3 percent this year.  Silver fell 0.7 percent to $23.7075 an ounce at 11:24 a.m.
in  Tokyo . The metal will average $31.25 an ounce in the fourth
quarter, 32 percent more than now, based on the median of 14
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Silver Powder  Dowa’s Kosaka plant in Akita prefecture has an annual
capacity of 800 tons, using scrap, imported ore and intermediate
products. Japan’s silver output rose 2.4 percent to 1,765 tons
in 2012, according to Japan Mining Industry Association data.  Dowa Electronics Materials Co., a unit of Dowa Holdings, is
the largest global supplier of silver powder for solar cells and
expanded output capacity 38 percent to 110 tons a month in 2011,
Takagi said. Global demand for silver powder will increase to
3,900 tons in 2014, a 44 percent jump from 2010, according to
management consultant  Fuji Chimera Research Institute Inc .  Toho Zinc, the second-biggest Japanese silver producer,
expanded annual production capacity 18 percent to 400 tons in
September at its Chigirishima smelter in Hiroshima. Toho
produces silver as a byproduct of smelting lead ore.  Japan added 1,394 megawatts of clean energy capacity, most
of it solar, between April last year and the end of January, the
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said on April 16.  Incentive Program  The country had 26,940 megawatts of clean energy capability
at the end of 2012, according to BNEF. Solar accounts for about
a third of all renewable energy, according to the data. The
additions follow the introduction of an incentive program begun
in July to increase clean energy such as wind and solar after
the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.  About 90 percent of the most commonly used photovoltaic
cells, which convert sunlight into electricity, use silver paste,
according to the Washington D.C.-based Silver Institute. More
than 100 million ounces are projected for use by solar energy in
2015, according to the institute.  Solar panels accounted for 6.9 percent of the industrial
demand for silver in 2011, according to CPM Group Inc. China,
the world’s biggest silver user after the U.S., will account for
24 percent of photovoltaic demand in 2015, according to BNEF
estimates.  To contact the reporters on this story:
