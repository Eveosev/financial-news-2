Lansdowne Partners Ltd., the second-biggest shareholder in  Cermaq ASA (CEQ) , said it will vote against the
Norwegian fishfeed maker’s offer for  Copeinca ASA (COP) , a
prerequisite for  Marine Harvest ASA (MHG) ’s takeover proposal for
Cermaq.  Lansdowne, the biggest European hedge-fund firm focused on
stock picking, didn’t say whether it would back Marine Harvest’s
$1.7 billion bid for Cermaq. A spokeswoman for the London-based
fund declined to comment further in an e-mail.  Lansdowne will “vote against the proposed acquisition of
Copeinca by Cermaq” at the May 21 annual general meeting, the
fund said in an e-mail dated May 10. “This decision reflects
our belief that the potential benefits of fish-farming
consolidation are sufficiently high to warrant full
consideration by all participants.”  Marine Harvest is seeking to buy Cermaq to expand into
fish-feed production as rising raw-material prices boost costs.
The company last month offered 105 kroner ($18) a share
including a 1 krone dividend, for Cermaq, which operates salmon
farms in Chile, Canada and  Norway  and makes feed. The bid, which
is conditional on Cermaq canceling a planned 3.5 billion-krone
takeover of Lima-based Copeinca, is “inadequate,” Cermaq has
said.  Lansdowne owns about 7.5 percent of Cermaq, making it the
biggest holder of the Oslo-based company after the Norwegian
state, according to Cermaq’s  website . Lansdowne also owns about
3.47 percent of Oslo-based Marine Harvest, according to the
Norwegian company’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
