Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBC is going back to
the future to refresh its Thursday night lineup, anchored by a
new comedy starring Michael J. Fox.  “The Michael J. Fox Show” will debut at 9:30 p.m.  New
York  time on Thursdays when the season begins in September, NBC
said yesterday in a statement. The family comedy stars Fox as a
former New York news anchor who returns to work after being
diagnosed with  Parkinson’s disease .  NBC is trying to tap into its former Thursday “Must See
TV” glory by building a new comedy lineup after this year’s
series finales of “30 Rock” and “The Office.” Leaning on
Fox’s popularity should give NBC a head start, although keeping
audiences interested isn’t a guarantee,  Gavin Polone , a film and
television producer, said in an interview.  “The first episode is going to draw a huge audience,”
said Polone, executive producer of “Twisted,” which debuts on
Walt Disney Co.’s ABC Family next month. “How many people come
back for the second or third episode will be key.”  Fox, who starred on NBC in the 1980s as Alex P. Keaton in
“Family Ties” and in the 1985 time-travel film “Back to the
Future,” hasn’t been a TV regular since leaving ABC’s “Spin
City” in 2001.  NBC, based in New York, is adding two other comedies in
September, “Welcome to the Family” and “Sean Saves the
World,” which features another returning actor from NBC’s glory
days -- Sean P. Hayes, who played bawdy Jack McFarland on “Will
& Grace.” NBC’s midseason comedy additions will be “The Family
Guide” and “About a Boy.”  Identity Crisis  New dramas include “The Blacklist,” “Ironside” and
“Dracula” in September, with “Believe,” “Crisis” and
“Crossbones” coming later in the season.  The network
announced last month it renewed dramas “Revolution,” “Chicago
Fire,” “Parenthood,” “Grimm,” and “Law & Order: Special
Victims Unit” for 22-episode seasons. It canceled newsmagazine
“Rock Center” and comedy “Go On,” starring  Matthew Perry .  NBC is still trying to establish an identity, years after
its  “Must See TV”  shows including “Seinfeld,” “Friends”
and “ER” have gone off the air, Polone said.  “I’m still not sure what defines an NBC show,” Polone
said. “‘Smash’ and  ‘Revolution’  are so different,’’ he said,
referring to the musical drama and the science-fiction program.
“Smash” wasn’t renewed.  Younger Viewers  NBC is the last-place network of the four largest
broadcasters this season among all audiences and is in third
place behind CBS and Fox among 18-to-49 year olds, according to
 Nielsen Holdings NV (NLSN)  data from May 5.  NBC’s average prime-time audience has fallen 6.1 percent
from a year ago to 6.98 million. Among viewers 18 to 49, it is
down 6.6 percent to 2.99 million.  The network is also making changes in its late-night lineup
to lure younger viewers.  Seth Meyers  will host a show at the
12:35 a.m. slot currently occupied by  Jimmy Fallon , said Rich Licata, a NBC spokesman. Fallon is scheduled to become the new
host of “The Tonight Show” next year as Jay Leno steps aside.  Ad spending on  network television  is projected to decline 2
percent this year to $16.9 billion, and total  TV advertising ,
including cable networks, will increase 2.8 percent to $63.9
billion, slowing from 7.1 percent in 2012, according to
ZenithOptimedia,  Publicis Groupe SA (PUB) ’s research division.  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Fox will present its TV lineup today at 4 p.m.
in New York. ABC and  CBS Corp. (CBS)  unveil their schedules later this
week.  *T NBC FALL 2013 SCHEDULE (New programs in UPPER CASE; all times
