Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Germany ’s biggest
bank, appointed Ziyad Al Ashaikh as general manager of its Saudi
Arabian branch in the capital city of Riyadh.  Al Ashaikh is taking over from Waleed Fatani who will be
leaving Deutsche Bank to pursue other opportunities outside the
bank, the company said in an e-mailed statement today.  “The appointment of Ziyad reflects the depth of skilled
and committed people working for Deutsche Bank in the
region,”said Ashok Aram, chief executive officer for  Middle
East  and North Africa operations. “Ziyad’s long experience and
insight into the Saudi market will be a great asset.”  Ziyad Al Ashaikh joined Deutsche Bank in 2010 as head of
private institutional clients and was responsible for managing
public sector and institutional relationships.  CEO of Deutsche Securities  Saudi Arabia , Jamal Alkishi,
said in an interview with Bloomberg in his Riyadh office on Feb.
11 that he expects Saudi Arabia will soon allow foreigners to
invest directly in local company shares, joining hedge fund
Passport Capital LLC in predicting the Market is set to open.  Saudi Arabia only allows non-resident foreigners outside of
the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council to invest through equity
swaps and exchange-traded funds. The country is interested in
attracting more institutional investors to the stock market,
where retail traders account for most deals.  As the general manager of the kingdom’s branch, Al Ashaikh
has oversight over all Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency regulated
activities, the bank said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
