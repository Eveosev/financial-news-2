Rafael Nadal  defeated Stanislas Wawrinka in straight sets today to win tennis’s Madrid Masters
for the third time.  Spain’s Nadal beat the Swiss 6-2, 6-4 for his fifth title
in seven tournaments since returning from injury after a seven-month absence.  Nadal, an 11-time Grand Slam winner currently ranked No. 5
by the ATP, came back in February after a knee injury. Since
then he’s also won titles in Sao Paulo, Acapulco, Indian Wells
and Barcelona.  Earlier today,  Serena Williams  retained the No. 1 ranking
on the women’s tennis tour as she defended her Madrid title
against French Open champion Maria Sharapova in straight sets.  Williams of the U.S. eased past Russia’s Sharapova, 6-1, 6-4 to claim her 50th title on the WTA Tour.  The 31-year-old now leads the second-ranked Sharapova 13-2
in career meetings, with her last defeat dating back to 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
