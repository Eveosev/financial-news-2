Tiger Woods ,  Sergio Garcia  and David
Lingmerth are tied for the lead at 11 under par as the final
round of the PGA’s Players championship has begun this morning
in  Ponte Vedra Beach , Florida.  The third round was completed earlier this morning after
being suspended by darkness last night. Former champions Woods
and Garcia trailed  Sweden ’s Lingmerth by two strokes when play
was halted yesterday on the Stadium Course at TPC Sawgrass.  Three golfers were at 10 under entering the fourth round --
Americans Casey Wittenberg and  Ryan Palmer , and Henrik Stenson
of Sweden.  Yesterday’s round featured a dispute between longtime
rivals Woods and Garcia, who accused his playing partner of
causing a distraction when he was about to hit a shot.  Garcia was about to hit his second shot from the fairway on
the second hole when there was a surge of noise in the middle of
his backswing. He hit the ball far to the right, leading to a
bogey.  The Spaniard told reporters that Woods, an American, had
pulled a club from his bag just as Garcia began his swing,
leading to a cheer from spectators.   “Obviously, he doesn’t know all the facts,” Woods
responded to reporters. “The marshal said he already hit and I
pulled the 5-wood and hit.”  After the round, Garcia was told of Woods’s comments.  “I don’t care,” Garcia said. “At least I’m true to
myself. I know what I’m doing. And he can do whatever he
wants.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
