Manchester United manager Alex
Ferguson today confirmed that England striker Wayne Rooney has
asked for a transfer from the club.  Ferguson was speaking to Sky Sports after seeing his team
beat Swansea 2-1 in his last home match.  Ferguson, 71, is retiring after 26 years at United, during
which he’s won 38 trophies including this year’s Premier League,
its 20th English title.  Ferguson said Rooney, left out of the squad today, “was
not keen to play because he has asked for a transfer.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
