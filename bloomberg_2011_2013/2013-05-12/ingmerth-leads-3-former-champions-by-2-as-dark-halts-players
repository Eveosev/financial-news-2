Sweden’s David Lingmerth led three
former title-holders by two strokes when the third round of the
PGA’s Players Championship was suspended for darkness.  Lingmerth stood 12-under through 17 holes of the third
round yesterday on the Stadium Course at TPC Sawgrass in  Ponte
Vedra Beach ,  Florida . Eight golfers will finish their rounds
this morning before play begins in the final round.  Former Players champions  Tiger Woods , Henrik Stenson and
Sergio Garcia trail Lingmerth by two strokes, and all four were
yet to finish when play stopped.  “I’m aware of where they’re at,” Lingmerth told reporters.
“I try not to look at the leaderboard when I’m out there. I’m
just trying to do my thing. But having those guys behind me, I
know they’re going to try to hunt me down, of course. But I’m
just going to try to forget about all that and just try to do my
thing.”  The rookie, four-under for the day after he eagled the 16th
and birdied the 17th hole, had missed his last five cuts before
entering the Players. He’ll play the 18th hole today.  Woods, Stenson and Garcia share second place at 10-under.
Stenson ended the day on the 16th hole while Woods and Garcia
played through 14 holes.  Jeff Maggert, who finished the round, bogeyed the final
hole for a 6-under 66 and was the clubhouse leader at 9-under
207. Casey Wittenberg and  Ryan Palmer  also were at 9-under and
still had to finish their rounds.  Play was halted for 1 hour, 48 minutes yesterday when
lightning hit the area. The third-round was suspended just
before 7:50 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
