The dollar gained versus most of its
major counterparts after a report showed U.S. retail sales
unexpectedly increased in April, bolstering optimism in the
world’s largest economy.  The euro fell for a third day versus the greenback before
data this week forecast to show the currency bloc’s economy
shrank for a sixth quarter. The shared currency advanced versus
the yen. The dollar rose to the highest level since 2008 versus
the yen amid bets the  Federal Reserve  will start to taper its
monthly bond buying under its quantitative-easing stimulus.
 Australia ’s dollar slid amid a drop in business confidence.  “We had better-than-expected retail-sales numbers from the
U.S., and  consumer spending  appears to be doing better than
expected amid headwinds,” Brian Daingerfield, a currency
strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc’s RBS Securities
unit in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , said in a telephone interview.
“Markets are very keen on stronger data in the U.S. potentially
portending a stronger dollar if the Fed opts to taper purchases
a bit early.”  The dollar climbed 0.7 percent against Australia’s currency
at 5 p.m.  New York  time, to 99.52 cents per Aussie, and reached
99.41 cents, the strongest level since June 14. The U.S.
currency strengthened 0.7 percent to 12.1649 Mexican pesos.  The greenback gained 0.1 percent to $1.2975 per euro, after
climbing 0.4 percent earlier. It rose 0.2 percent to 101.85 yen
and touched 102.15, its highest level since October 2008. The
Japanese currency depreciated 0.1 percent versus the euro to
132.12 and reached 132.40, the weakest since January 2010.  Relative Strength  The yen approached a technical level that suggested it may
soon strengthen. The currency’s 14-day relative strength index
against the dollar declined to 29.6, below the 30 level some
traders see as a signal an asset has fallen too far, too fast
and may be due to reverse course.  The yen lost 6.6 percent over the past three months against
nine developed-nation peers monitored by Bloomberg Correlation
Weighted Indexes. The dollar gained 3.5 percent, while the euro
added 0.2 percent.  The Australian dollar slid versus all of its 16 most-traded
counterparts after National Australia Bank Ltd. said its index
of  business confidence  in the nation fell to negative 2 in
April, the lowest since November, from 2 in March. The  Reserve
Bank  of Australia lowered interest rates to a record-low 2.75
percent on May 7.  ‘Ferociously Uncompetitive’  “It’s all because they built up their commodity sector
tremendously, the currency went way up,”  John Taylor , founder
and chief executive officer of the currency hedge-fund FX
Concepts LLC, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s
“Market Makers” with  Erik Schatzker  and  Trish Regan . “The
rest of the economy is ferociously uncompetitive.”  The Aussie dollar declined 0.5 percent to 101.34 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, lost 0.6 percent
to 82.49 U.S. cents and touched 82.29, the weakest since March
21. It depreciated 0.4 percent to 84 yen.  The Brazilian real climbed against all of its most-traded
peers as traders bet the central bank will intervene to stem the
currency’s losses. Central-bank President Alexandre Tombini said
in a May 10 interview with Globo television that policy makers
will do whatever is needed to slow inflation.  The real appreciated 0.6 percent to 2.0080 per dollar and
increased 0.8 percent to 2.6054 per euro.  Israel ’s shekel dropped versus all 31 of its most-traded
counterparts after the central bank unexpectedly cut its
benchmark  interest rate  to a three-year low and announced a
program to purchase foreign currency to limit gains in the
currency. The shekel lost 1.2 percent to 3.6139 per dollar.  U.S. Sales  U.S. retail sales increased 0.1 percent, following a 0.5
percent drop in March, Commerce Department figures showed today
in  Washington . The median forecast of 81 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for a 0.3 percent drop. Figures used to
calculate growth, which exclude categories such as automobiles,
also advanced.  Fed Bank of Philadelphia President  Charles Plosser  said on
May 9 U.S. unemployment will probably fall to 7 percent at the
end of 2013 and he would favor reducing the Fed’s $85 billion
monthly pace of bond-buying next month. The jobless rate was 7.5
percent last month. The Fed buys bonds to put downward pressure
on borrowing costs.  Plosser’s remarks highlighted a debate within the  Federal
Open Market Committee  on whether to expand or curb the pace of
asset purchases that pumped up the central bank’s balance sheet
to $3.32 trillion.  Yen Bets  Futures traders increased their wagers that the yen will
decline against the  U.S. dollar ,  figures  from the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed last week. The
difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and other
large speculators on a decline in the yen compared with those on
an increase -- so-called net shorts -- was 78,560 on May 7,
compared with net shorts of 71,127 a week earlier.  Trading in over-the-counter foreign-exchange options
totaled $33 billion as of 5:08 p.m., compared with $53 billion
on May 10, according to data reported by U.S. banks to the
Depository Trust Clearing Corp. and tracked by Bloomberg. Volume
in options on the dollar-yen  exchange rate  amounted to $12
billion, the largest share of trades at 36 percent. Australian
dollar-U.S. dollar options were the second most actively traded
at $4.5 billion, or 14 percent.  Dollar-yen options trading was 4 percent above the average
for the past five Mondays at a similar time in the day,
according to Bloomberg analysis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
