Queen Elizabeth II  should step down
from the throne if she becomes to ill to rule, a Sunday Times
YouGov poll showed for the first time, according to the
newspaper  today .  The 87-year-old monarch, who has been the head of state in
the U.K. since Feb. 6, 1952, should remain queen for life,
according to 53 percent of those polled, down from 64 percent in
March. Fourteen percent said they didn’t know. Should the Queen
become too ill to stay in her role, then 48 percent believed she
should stand down. That’s compared to 51 percent in March, the
YouGov poll showed. The minority, 43 percent, believed she
should continue.  Fifty percent believed the Queen’s eldest son Prince Charles will make a good king, a 13 percentage point increase
from May last year, the poll showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
