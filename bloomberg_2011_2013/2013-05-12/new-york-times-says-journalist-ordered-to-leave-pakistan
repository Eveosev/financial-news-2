The  New York  Times said its bureau
chief in Pakistan has been expelled after being told by the
 Interior Ministry  that his visa had been canceled.  Declan Walsh was accompanied to the airport by plainclothes
intelligence officers today after reporting on elections from
Lahore yesterday, the newspaper said on its website.  Walsh received the ministry notice on May 9 at his home in
Islamabad, according to the report. The order cited unspecified
“undesirable activities” and gave the journalist 72 hours to
leave the country.  “No further details of any wrongdoing were given, and
Pakistani officials did not respond to repeated requests for
more information,” the New York Times said.  In a series of posts on his Twitter feed today, Walsh
described being escorted to the airport, adding, “hard to
believe this is happening.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
