Manchester City manager  Roberto Mancini , whose team lost 1-0 to Wigan in yesterday’s F.A. Cup
final, criticized his club for not quelling speculation over his
job, the Sunday Times reported.  The Italian is set to be replaced by Malaga’s Manuel Pellegrini after a trophyless season, the newspaper said. After
yesterday’s game Mancini complained that City didn’t deny
reports that he’d lose his job.  “I didn’t know why the club didn’t stop this because I
didn’t think that was correct,” he told reporters. “I didn’t
think that it was true. If it’s true we will see in the next two
weeks.”  A contract has already been placed before Pellegrini, who
has verbally agreed to take over, the Times added, citing
unidentified sources close to the Chilean.  City lost its Premier League title to  Manchester United 
this season and failed to progress beyond the group stage of the
 Champions League .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
