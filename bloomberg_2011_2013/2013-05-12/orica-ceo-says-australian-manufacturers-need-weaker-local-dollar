Orica Ltd. (ORI) , the world’s largest maker
of industrial explosives, said a decline in the Australian
dollar is needed to help manufacturers that are struggling to
compete with cheaper imports.  Australia’s central bank should do “everything in their
power to get it down,” Chief Executive Officer  Ian Smith  said
in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corp.’s ‘Inside
Business’ program. “The overall state of the economy is being
hollowed out.”  Australia’s dollar on May 10 dropped below parity with its
U.S. counterpart for the first time in more than 10 months,
three days after the Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest
rates to a record low. The Aussie’s stretch above parity, the
longest since exchange controls were scrapped in 1983, sparked
calls for policy action from union leaders and businesses
including Orica and  Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd. (CCL)   “The overall trend for Australia’s sake should be down,”
Orica’s Smith said in the interview.  Reserve Bank Governor  Glenn Stevens  cut the overnight cash-rate target by 25 basis points this month to 2.75 percent and
indicated there is scope for further reductions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
