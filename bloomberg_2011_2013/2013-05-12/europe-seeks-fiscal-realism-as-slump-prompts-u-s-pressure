European policy makers expressed a
willingness to consider new ways to revive their ailing economy
as they confronted fresh U.S. pressure to take action.  The bloc’s finance ministers and central bankers left
weekend talks of the Group of Seven signaling that they’re
poised to scale back austerity, are open to increased monetary
aid and looking to unfreeze bank lending. European officials
will meet in Brussels today to discuss the economy and review
aid payments for crisis-struck nations from  Greece  to Spain.  Europe’s governments are in the midst of a policy rethink
after three years of slimming budgets as they face up to a
deepening recession in the euro area and a record unemployment
rate that’s exceeded 12 percent. Still in doubt for economists
is what kind of stimulus will actually be delivered and what
effect it could have in the crisis-torn 17-member currency bloc.  “The new ‘fiscal realism’ is in evidence,” Mark Wall, co-chief European economist at Deutsche Bank AG in London, said in
a report to clients. “Austerity may have reached its political
limits and markets are happy to see some rebalancing. The key
remains economic growth.”  Yields on sovereign debt that soared during the crisis have
eased with the European Central Bank’s pledge to do whatever it
takes to defend the euro. The single currency was little changed
at $1.2986 as of 9:03 a.m. today.  Record Low  Italy’s one-year borrowing costs fell to a record low on
May 10, while  Portugal ’s 10-year bond yield slid to the least
since August 2010. Spanish 10-year yields rose last week for the
first time in six weeks after declining to a three-year low of
3.94 percent on May 3. German 10-year yields were about one
basis point from the highest level in seven weeks today.  Euro-area governments are already easing up on fiscal
consolidation, with countries including France and Spain poised
to receive more time to meet European Union budget-deficit
goals. That means less pressure to take tax and spending steps
to plug fiscal shortfalls caused by economic weakness.  Italy’s new government is trying to reverse some of its
predecessor’s policies such as a pending sales-tax increase.
Spain has introduced plans to support the creation of new
businesses and invest in research and development.  The ECB is also debating what more it can do. The bank’s
president, Mario Draghi, told reporters after the G-7 talks that
it’s considering buying asset-backed securities among options to
support lending to small and medium-sized companies.  “On the lending side, we see that the situation is still
tight, especially in the periphery,” Draghi said after the
meeting in Aylesbury, near  London . Still, “the situation is in
a sense getting less bad.”  Bank Lending  Authorities are keen to rally lending at banks, which
account for about 80 percent of corporate financing in the euro
area, compared with less than 20 percent in the U.S. Small
companies in the periphery are especially starved of cash,
hurting a traditional engine for hiring.  Europe’s ease in austerity measures could translate into a
decline in the bloc’s so-called structural budget deficit by
less than 1 percentage point of output, compared with a 3-point
decline over the last two years, Credit Suisse Group AG said.  Highlighting the change in tone, French Finance Minister
Pierre Moscovici said there needs to be a greater onus on
improving the competitiveness of economies and delivering
consolidation that’s credible and doesn’t destroy growth.  “I don’t like the word austerity,” Moscovici told
Bloomberg Television’s Francine Lacqua after the G-7 meeting.
“It means cutting over what is necessary.”  Moscovici said  France  is suffering “adjustment fatigue”
as it teeters on the brink of its third recession in four years.  ‘Enough Room’  Even Germany, Europe’s biggest economy and the lead
advocate of budgetary rigor, has softened. Finance Minister
Wolfgang Schaeuble said May 9 that Europe now has “enough room
to maneuver” on fiscal policy.  “Nobody spoke about austerity policy,” he told reporters
after the G-7. “Everybody agrees that we never conducted an
exclusive austerity policy, but that we always carried out
policies for sustainable growth, which of course have
sustainable public finances as a precondition.”  Chancellor Angela Merkel too has voiced her distaste of the
term “austerity,” even as she continues to press the need for
structural reforms to render Europe more competitive globally.  The German government sees economic reform in the euro area
pushing in the right direction, while identifying shortcomings
in the labor markets of  Italy , Spain and Greece that still need
to be addressed, Der Spiegel magazine reported, citing a
preliminary report on the EU’s “growth pact” prepared by
Merkel’s Chancellery in Berlin.  Economic Slump  The shift in emphasis comes amid signs that Europe’s
economic slump is outlasting forecasts and as pressure increases
from overseas to help tackle a softening in global growth.  Euro  gross domestic product  fell 0.1 percent in the first
quarter, according to the median of 39 economists’ forecasts in
a Bloomberg News survey before a May 15 report. That would
lengthen the recession to beyond the 15-month-long contraction
in 2008-2009, during the financial crisis.  “We feel very strongly there needs to be the right balance
between austerity and growth,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew told CNBC Television before the G-7 meeting. “Overall,
Europe is going to need to do a little bit better. There’s room
for progress.”  ‘Important Precondition’  Still,  Germany ’s Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann
continued to highlight deficit reduction as “one important
precondition for sustainable growth.”  Germany also reiterated its resistance to easier monetary
policy. Schaeuble said G-7 officials were “increasingly
concerned” about “relative high liquidity” from central banks
worldwide. Weidmann said low rates can generate stability risks
and noted attention must be paid to German property prices,
although he doesn’t yet see a credit-driven bubble.  Economists at Commerzbank AG say a change in the fiscal
course could increase short-term economic growth by 0.5
percentage points. Still, they and counterparts at Bank of
America Merrill Lynch say still-rising government debts as well
as structural weaknesses including weak banks and Spain’s
collapsed property market will remain brakes on expansion.  “We do not see this relaxation as having any major
positive effects on the economic outlook,” Bank of America
economists Ruben Segura-Cayuela and Laurence Boone said in a
report titled “Fiscal easing: don’t get your hopes up.”  As for the ECB, Draghi said its role is “going to be
mostly catalytic,” since it works with the European Investment
Bank and the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm. “It’s
going to be very much up to these actors to act, rather than the
ECB. So European Commission, the EIB and national governments.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
