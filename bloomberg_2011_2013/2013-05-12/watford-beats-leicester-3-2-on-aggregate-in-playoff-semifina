Watford beat Leicester 3-2 on
aggregate in English soccer’s Championship playoff semifinal
with a 97th-minute goal from Troy Deeney.  Only seconds before, Watford goalkeeper Manuel Almunia made
a double save from Anthony Knockaert’s penalty kick, awarded for
a foul on the Leicester player. Watford swept downfield and
Deeney slammed the ball in for a 3-1 win. Leicester won the
first game 1-0.  ‘It’s great, that’s what football is all about,” Watford
manager Gianfranco Zola told Sky Sports. “I think we deserved
it.”  Matej Vydra volleyed Watford into the lead in the 15th
minute, David Nugent leveling for the visitors four minutes
later. Vydra struck again in the 65th minute to level the scores
on aggregate.  Watford will meet Crystal Palace or Brighton in the final
at Wembley on May 27 to decide which team is promoted to the
Premier League. Palace and Brighton play the second leg of their
semifinal tomorrow, having drawn the first match 0-0.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
