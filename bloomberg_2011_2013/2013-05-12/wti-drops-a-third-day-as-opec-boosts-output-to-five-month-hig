West Texas Intermediate crude fell
for a third day, the longest run of declines in four weeks, as
OPEC boosted output to the highest level in five months.  WTI slid as much as 1.2 percent, and London-traded Brent
dropped for a second day. The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries produced 30.46 million barrels a day last
month, up from 30.18 million in March, the group’s secretariat
said May 10. That’s the most since November. Morgan Stanley
predicted that the spread between WTI and Brent will widen as
U.S. supplies accumulate.  “Even if demand surprises, the market is still likely to
remain comfortably supplied,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an
analyst at VTB Capital in London, who predicts that WTI will
struggle to surpass $96.80 a barrel this month.  WTI for June delivery fell as much as $1.18 to $94.86 a
barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange
and recovered to $95.63 as of 12:55 p.m. London time. The volume
of all contracts traded was 1.5 percent below the 100-day
average.  Brent for June settlement lost as much as $1.28, or 1.2
percent, to $102.63 on the ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
European benchmark crude was at a premium of $7.50 to WTI, the
narrowest since January 2011, compared with $7.87 on May 10.  Saudi Output  The gap between WTI and Brent is “near a trough and should
widen again, at least marginally, later this year” because of a
growing surplus of supply in Houston, Adam Longson, an analyst
at Morgan Stanley based in New York, said in a report today.  Saudi Arabia pumped 9.27 million barrels a day in April, up
from 9.13 million in March, OPEC’s Vienna-based secretariat said
May 10 in its monthly Oil Market Report. That’s the highest
since November and compares with the country’s own figure of
9.31 million barrels, based on its communication with the 12-member group.  The kingdom “remains committed to its role as a stable and
reliable supplier” that has consistently increased production
to offset shortfalls, Saudi Oil Minister  Ali Al-Naimi  said May
10 in Istanbul, where he traveled to meet  Turkey ’s energy
minister,  Taner Yildiz .  “Brent a little over $100 a barrel seems reasonable for
the short term,” said Robin Mills, the head of consulting at
Dubai-based Manaar Energy Consulting and Project Management.
“In the long term, it’s set to come down a little.”  Chinese Factories  China ’s  industrial production  climbed 9.3 percent in April
from a year earlier, data from the National Bureau of Statistics
in Beijing showed today. That’s below the median estimate of 9.4
percent in a Bloomberg News survey of 38 economists. The country
is the world’s second-largest oil consumer and accounted for 11
percent of global demand in 2011, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s
Statistical Review of World Energy.  WTI has technical support along its 100-day moving average,
about $93.53 a barrel today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Futures on May 10 halted an intraday drop near this
indicator, signaling that’s where buy orders may be clustered.  Net-long positions in WTI held by money managers, including
hedge funds, commodity pools and trading advisers, increased in
the seven days ended May 7, according to the U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission. They rose by 10,572 futures and
options combined, or 5.5 percent, to 204,534, the regulator said
in its Commitments of Traders report on May 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
