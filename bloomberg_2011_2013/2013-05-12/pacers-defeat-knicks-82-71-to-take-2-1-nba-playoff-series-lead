Roy Hibbert  had 24 points and 12
rebounds to lead the Indiana Pacers to an 82-71 win over the New
York Knicks in their National Basketball Association playoff
series.  The Pacers own a two-games-to-one lead in the best-of-seven
Eastern Conference semifinal series.  “We came out strong and aggressive,” Hibbert said in a
televised interview. “They’re a talented team. All and all,
it’s a good effort for us.”  In a Western Conference game yesterday, the Memphis
Grizzlies took a 2-1 lead over the Oklahoma City Thunder with an
87-81 victory.  In today’s game, the Golden State Warriors host Game 4
against the San Antonio Spurs, who have a two games to one lead
in the Western Conference series.  The Pacers moved out to a 36-33 halftime advantage before
outscoring the Knicks 26-20 in the third quarter and then
opening up as much as a 16-point lead in the fourth quarter on
their home court at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.  George Hill  had 17 points and  Paul George  contributed 14
points for the Pacers, who host Game 4 on May 14.  Knicks Outrebounded  Carmelo Anthony, who averages 28.7 points per game, was
held to 21 points as he connected on 6-of-16 field goal attempts
and only one 3-pointer for the Knicks.  “They outrebounded us, they won the hustle today, the
little things,” Anthony said. “It all came down to us not
scoring the basketball. We can’t beat anyone scoring 71
points.”  Amar’e Stoudemire returned after a two-month absence to go
3-for-8 from the field to score seven points, including one 3-pointer, in the nine minutes he played. J.R. Smith, who had a
102-degree fever during the morning, added nine points.  “Offensively, we just didn’t have anything,” coach  Mike
Woodson  said. “I thought defensively, we hung in there and did
what we had had to do, but we just didn’t have any offensive pop
and we have to figure that out.”  At FedExForum in Memphis,  Marc Gasol  scored 20 points and
Mike Conley and  Tony Allen  each added 14 for the Grizzlies, who
host Game 4 tomorrow.  Kevin Durant  had 25 points and 11 rebounds for the Thunder
and  Reggie Jackson  added 16 points and 10 rebounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
