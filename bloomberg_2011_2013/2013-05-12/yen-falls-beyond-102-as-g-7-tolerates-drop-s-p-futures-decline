Ten-year Treasury yields reached the
highest level since March as retail sales unexpectedly rose,
while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed at a
record level. The dollar rallied and oil fell for a third day.  Ten-year rates rose two basis points to 1.92 percent at 4
p.m. in  New York . The  S&P 500 (SPX)  gained less than 0.01 percent to
1,633.7 to reach a record for the seventh time in eight
days. The dollar strengthened against all 16 major peers except
the Brazilian real. The yen fell 0.2 percent to 101.86 a dollar
after weakening beyond 102 for the first time since 2008.
Italian 10-year  bonds  fell, with yields climbing nine basis
points to 3.98 percent, as the government sold 8 billion euros
($10.4 billion) of debt. Oil retreated as much as 1.6 percent
while crops rallied.  The unexpected 0.1 percent gain in U.S. retail sales added
to optimism that central-bank efforts to spur economic growth
are working. Chinese data showed fixed-asset investment
unexpectedly decelerated while industrial output trailed
estimates and crude-oil processing reached the lowest level in
eight months. Group of Seven policy makers said after meeting in
the U.K that they examined Japan’s stimulus strategy and that
they will monitor its impact on currencies.  “It’s the wave of short-term positive economic sentiment
that’s continuing here,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income
strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia.
“We’re likely to see some value buying as the 10-year comes in
the mid-1.90 percent area, 1.94 percent is where buying is
likely to step in.”  Yield Watch  U.S. 10-year benchmark yields rose for a  third day  as
European policy makers expressed a willingness to consider more
ways to spur growth following weekend G7 talks. A report May 17
is forecast to show consumer sentiment in May climbed to the
highest level this year.  Thirty-year  bonds  also fell, sending yields up three basis
points to 3.13 percent, the highest since March 26 on a closing
basis. The Dollar Index, a gauge of the currency against six
major peers, rose 0.2 percent to 83.27, near the highest level
since August, among bets the  Federal Reserve  will taper its bond
purchases.  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage debt
each month to support the economy by putting downward pressure
on borrowing costs. The central bank said after a policy meeting
on May 1 it will keep buying bonds “until the outlook for the
labor market has improved substantially.” It also left
unchanged a statement saying it plans to hold its target
interest rate near zero as long as unemployment remains above
6.5 percent and the outlook for inflation doesn’t exceed 2.5
percent.  U.S. Stocks  The S&P 500 advanced 1.2 percent  last week  and is up almost
15 percent this year. The increase in retail sales followed a
0.5 percent drop in March, Commerce Department figures showed
today in  Washington . The median forecast of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg called for a 0.3 percent drop.  Alcoa Inc., DuPont Co. and  Intel Corp . dropped at least 1.7
percent to lead declines in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average ,
while Pfizer Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. rose more than 1.4
percent for the biggest gains.  Yum! Brands Inc. fell 2.1 percent after the owner of the
KFC and Pizza Hut dining chains reported a slump in April sales
in  China . Theravance Inc. rose 18 percent after Elan Corp.
agreed to pay $1 billion for a share in royalties on new drugs.  Forecast Raised  Oppenheimer & Co. increased its year-end forecast for the
 S&P 500  to 1,730 and raised its estimate for earnings-per-share
to $109, saying concerns about the  U.S. economy  will be
“addressed and offset by positive economic data and corporate
developments,” chief equity strategist John Stoltzfus wrote in
a note to clients. Oppenheimer, which now has the second-most
bullish forecast among 17 strategist estimates compiled by
Bloomberg, had previously had a year-end forecast of 1,585 and
EPS of $108.  Returns from the U.S. equity bull market that started four
years ago are matching those from the last half of the 1990s
even as valuations are 28 percent lower.  The S&P 500 has gained 26.2 percent annually including
dividends since March 2009, the same as during the last 50
months of the technology bubble, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Shares in the index now trade at 18.6 times annual
profit, below the average 25.7 multiple in the 1990s rally led
by Internet companies.  For bulls , the valuations show stocks will keep rising
after the S&P 500 returned 164 percent as individuals scarred by
the worst financial meltdown since the Great Depression return
to equities. Bears say the price-earnings ratios mean investors
lack confidence in the economy and corporate profit growth. They
also note that the last time returns were this high, the bubble
popped and more than $5 trillion was erased from the value of
U.S. stocks, according to data from the  World Bank .  ‘Considerable Upside’  “The market has risen faster than we expected in 2013 but
we still forecast considerable upside to the S&P 500 during the
next few years,” Goldman Sachs Group  Inc. strategists led by
 David Kostin  in New York wrote in a research note. While
“multiple valuation frameworks indicate S&P 500 currently
trades at or above fair value,” they wrote, “under the right
circumstances, low real bond yields and improving U.S. economic
growth could also justify significantly higher valuations.”  European Markets  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index retreated 0.2 percent from the
highest level since June 2008, with trading volume 16 percent
less than the 30-day average. Commerzbank AG slid 4.7 percent
after Handelsblatt said Germany’s second-biggest lender will
sell new shares this week. Standard Chartered Plc dropped 1.9
percent as  Carson Block , the short seller who runs Muddy Waters
LLC, said he’s betting against the bank’s debt.  Lonmin Plc rallied 2.6 percent as the third-largest
platinum producer returned to profit in the fiscal first half
after sales increased.  The Stoxx 600 has surged 8.9 percent this year and last
week closed at the highest level in almost five years.  “We’ve been thinking about a correction for a while,”
Joost van Leenders, who helps oversee $657 billion as a
strategist at BNP Paribas Investment Partners in Amsterdam, said
by phone today. “So much of the market is driven by liquidity
rather than economies. And we haven’t seen it.”  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index fell for a third day,
dropping 0.8 percent. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of
mainland companies slid 2.1 percent and the  Shanghai Composite
Index (SHCOMP)  lost 0.2 percent. India’s Sensex sank 2.1 percent after a
10 percent rally from this year’s low on April 9 sent the gauge
to the highest level since January and a report showed the trade
deficit widened.  Pakistan Record  Pakistan’s KSE 100 Index jumped 1.7 percent to a record as
unofficial election results showed a party led by former Prime
Minister  Nawaz Sharif  winning the most seats in parliament.  The  S&P GSCI (SPGSCI)  gauge of 24 raw materials retreated 0.2
percent as gains in agricultural commodities were offset by
losses in energy. Gold slipped 0.2 percent to $1,434.30 an
ounce, the third consecutive decline.  Hedge funds  increased bets on lower  gold prices  after
investors pulled a record $20.8 billion from bullion funds this
year while BlackRock Inc., the world’s biggest money manager,
said it’s still bullish.  Speculators held 67,374 so-called short contracts on May 7,
6.4 percent more than a week earlier, U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission data show. The net-long position dropped 10
percent to 49,260 futures and options. Net-bullish wagers across
18 U.S.-traded raw materials climbed 5.8 percent to 582,265,
with gains for cocoa, cotton and hogs.  Crude Supplies  West Texas Intermediate crude slid for a third day,
dropping 0.9 percent to $95.17 a barrel after OPEC boosted
output to the highest level in five months. The  International
Energy Agency , an adviser to 28 oil-consuming nations, will
release forecasts for supply and demand through to 2018 in its
Medium-Term Oil Market Report tomorrow.  Corn rose more than 3 percent, the most in two weeks, on
speculation that persistent wet weather in parts of the Midwest
will delay planting and curb yield potential of the biggest U.S.
crop. Soybeans and wheat also climbed.  About 36 percent of the Midwest was dry enough for corn
planting during the weekend after rain last week, and unusually
cold temperatures kept soils muddy, T-Storm Weather LLC said in
a report today. More rain beginning May 16 will add to sowing
delays, the forecaster said. Corn was planted on about 12
percent of the intended acreage on May 5, the slowest since
1984, the government said.  Italy Auction  Italy’s  two-year yield  rose eight basis points to 1.36
percent. Italy sold 3.5 billion euros of 2016 bonds with
investors bidding for 1.34 times the amount offered, down from
1.40 times last month. The yield on 10-year German bunds fell
two basis points to 1.36 percent.  The shekel weakened 1.3 percent against the dollar as
Israel’s central bank cut its benchmark rate 25 basis points to
1.5 percent.  Australia’s dollar weakened for a sixth day, the longest
losing streak in almost a year, as Treasurer  Wayne Swan  is
forecast to project a fifth and sixth year of budget deficits
tomorrow. The so-called Aussie fell as much as 0.8 percent to
99.41 earlier, the weakest since June 14.  To contact the reporters on this story:
