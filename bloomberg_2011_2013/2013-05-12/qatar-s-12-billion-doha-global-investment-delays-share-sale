Doha Global Investment, the $12
billion fund controlled by Qatar Holding LLC, will delay its
initial public offering as it awaits regulatory approvals.  The new IPO date after “fulfilling all requirements” will
be announced in the local news media, Hussein Al Abdulla, vice
chairman of Qatar Holding, said in a statement distributed by
the Qatar Exchange without giving a time frame. Al Abdulla told
state-run  Qatar News Agency  April 6 the share sale would happen
in May.  The delay “would probably help ease some of the IPO-driven
liquidations on the retail side,” Bobby Sarkar, head of
research at Qatar National Bank Financial Services, said in a
phone interview from the capital Doha. The benchmark QE Index
has gained 5.8 percent this year, compared with an advance of 35
percent for Dubai’s DFM General Index. The QE Index closed
unchanged today.  Qatar, home to the world’s third-largest gas reserves, set
up Doha Global Investment in February to help buy assets
overseas. Four companies owned by state-run Qatar Petroleum plan
to sell shares to the public in the coming years as the country
seeks to build its $136 billion stock exchange, Al Abdulla said
last week.  Qatar Holding, a unit of the Persian Gulf emirate’s
sovereign-wealth fund, plans to sell 50 percent Doha Global
Investment to Qatari citizens, companies and institutions. The
fund was to receive $3 billion from Qatar Holding and raise
another $3 billion through the IPO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
