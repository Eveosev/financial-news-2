Top-seeded Syracuse University erased
an early four-goal deficit to beat Bryant 12-7 in its opening
game at the national college lacrosse tournament, while Cornell
University had the biggest upset of the first round with a 16-8
win over sixth-seeded  Maryland .  Third-seeded Ohio State and No. 7 Duke also won yesterday
to advance to the second round of the National Collegiate
Athletic Association tournament. Ohio State topped Towson State
16-6 and Duke beat Loyola of Maryland 12-11 in double overtime.  Syracuse scored three fourth quarter goals to pull away
from Bryant, which had led 4-0 less than seven minutes into the
first quarter. Dylan Donahue scored three goals for the Orange,
while Kevin Rice and Luke Cometti each had two.  Syracuse  next plays May 18  against Yale University, which
beat eighth-seeded Penn State 10-7 two days ago.  Cornell yesterday gave the Ivy League a second
representative in the final eight of the tournament as Rob
Pannell and Steve Mock each scored four goals against Maryland.  Cornell next faces Ohio State, which pushed its winning
streak to seven games by routing Towson in its first NCAA
tournament game since 2008.  Duke won the closest opening-round matchup yesterday as
Case Matheis scored his third goal of the game with one minute,
40 seconds left in the second overtime against Loyola.  In May 11 first-round games, second-seeded Notre Dame
defeated Detroit 9-7, fourth-seeded Denver topped Albany 19-14,
and fifth-seeded North Carolina beat Lehigh 16-7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
