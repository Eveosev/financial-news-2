The  Daily Mail & General Trust (DMGT) ,
publisher of the U.K.’s Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday tabloids,
will pay damages to Societe Generale SA after falsely saying the
French bank was in dire financial difficulties.  The Mail on Sunday said in August that Societe Generale was
at risk because of its exposure to Greek debt and that the
French government was ready to bail out the bank, the tabloid
said on its  website  yesterday.  “We accept that this was untrue; the bank was not in
serious financial difficulties, nor was it on the brink of
insolvency or in line for a bailout from the French
government,” the tabloid said. “We have apologized to the bank
and have agreed to pay damages.”  Societe Generale,  France ’s second-largest bank, fell
8.4 percent on Aug. 8, the day after the story was published.
The article also named  UniCredit SpA (UCG) , the largest Italian bank.
The Mail on Sunday didn’t mention UniCredit in its apology or
disclose the amount it will pay to Societe Generale. Both banks
denied the allegations at the time.  The tabloid said in August that the two banks may need a
rescue “having been hugely damaged by the worsening crisis
across the Eurozone.”  Daily Mail spokesmen did not immediately return a call
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
