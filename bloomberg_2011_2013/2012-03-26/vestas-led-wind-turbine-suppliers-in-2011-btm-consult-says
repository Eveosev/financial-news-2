Vestas (VWS)  Wind Systems A/S remained
the world’s largest wind turbine maker last year,  Navigant
Consulting Inc. (NCI) ’s BTM Consult unit said in an annual study that
lowered its forecast for the market through 2016.  Vestas (VWS)  retained its top spot with 12.9 percent of the
market in 2011, topping Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology
Co. with a 9.4 percent share.  General Electric Co. (GE)  was third
with 8.8 percent, Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA was next at 8.2
percent and Enercon GmbH fifth at 7.9 percent, Ringkoebing,
Denmark-based BTM said today in an e-mailed statement.  Wind installations reached a record 41.7 gigawatts last
year. While BTM said the market will continue to grow, it
reduced its cumulative forecast for the five years through 2016
by 14 percent to almost 270,000 megawatts, citing the European
credit crisis as denting confidence in the industry.  The downgrade in the forecast “is justified by the fact
that the current sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone has led
to panic across a number of crisis-stricken developed markets,”
BTM said. “Such measures have applied pressure to reduce
renewable incentives, which has had a detrimental impact on
investor confidence in the wind industry.”  Spain , which in 2009 was the top wind energy installer in
 Europe  according to Global Wind Energy Council data, this year
suspended subsidies to new renewable installations as it reins
in spending. The European share of new wind power fell last year
to 24.5 percent of the global total from more than half five
years ago, according to BTM.  China was the largest market last year, installing 17.6
gigawatts of turbines. The U.S., where a production tax credit
that benefits wind power expires at the end of the year,
installed 6.8 gigawatts. India put up 3.3 gigawatts of turbines
and  Germany  led European nations at just over 2 gigawatts, BTM
said.  The U.K. led in offshore wind installations, with more than
90 percent of the 470 megawatts of turbines erected at sea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
