The cost to attend Harvard College,
the undergraduate division of  Harvard University , will increase
3.5 percent for the 2012-13 academic year.  The $54,496 price, up from $52,652 for this year, includes
tuition, fees and room and board and will affect students who
don’t receive need-based financial aid. Harvard will increase
its aid budget to a record $172 million, according to a
 statement  today from the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based school.  More than 60 percent of undergraduate students are expected
to receive a grant based on financial need. Families with normal
assets who make $65,000 or less aren’t required to contribute to
their child’s education, and those with incomes of as much as
$150,000 pay from zero to 10 percent of their income.  “Need-blind admissions, supported by generous financial
aid, is the bedrock of Harvard’s effort to attract the most
talented undergraduates in America and across the globe,
regardless of their ability to pay,” Michael D. Smith, dean of
the faculty of Arts and Sciences, said in the  statement .  Harvard, one of the eight Ivy League schools in the
northeastern U.S., is the wealthiest school in higher education
with an endowment of $32 billion as of June 30. Alumni of
 Harvard College  include Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben Bernanke 
and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Executive Officer  Lloyd
Blankfein . President  Barack Obama  is a graduate of Harvard’s law
school.  Lower Threshold  Harvard lowered the threshold for those who pay from zero
to 10 percent of family income to $150,000 from $180,000,
beginning with the class that will graduate in 2016. Those
families will be asked “to pay slightly more than 10 percent of
income,” Harvard said on its website in September 2011. Also
beginning with the class that enters this September, the school
increased the income threshold for families that have no
contribution to $65,000 from $60,000.  “These adjustments help to meet heightened demand for aid
precipitated by ongoing challenges in the  United States  and the
global economies,”  Jeff Neal , a Harvard spokesman, said in an
e-mail. “Demand for aid is most acute at the lower end of the
economic spectrum, and Harvard modified its policy and expanded
its investment to respond to this need.”  Applicants to Harvard College will find out on March 29 if
they have been accepted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
