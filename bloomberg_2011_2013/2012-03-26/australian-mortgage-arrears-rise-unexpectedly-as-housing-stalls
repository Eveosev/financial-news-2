Australian home loan delinquencies
rose unexpectedly as a  stalling housing market  kept a lid on
financing options for homeowners,  Fitch Ratings  said.  Mortgage payments overdue by more than 30 days rose to 1.57
percent of the value of loans in the three months ended Dec. 31,
from 1.52 percent in the third quarter, according to the London-
based ratings firm’s Australian residential mortgage performance
index.  “Stagnation in the housing market limits the refinance and
sale options for borrowers in financial distress,” James
Zanesi, an analyst at Fitch, wrote in the statement. “The
increase in  mortgage rates  and the usual Christmas spending are
likely to lead to an increase in arrears during the first
quarter of 2012.”  The number of “low-doc” loans more than 30 days late
climbed to 6.6 percent in the third quarter from 6.3 percent in
the previous three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
