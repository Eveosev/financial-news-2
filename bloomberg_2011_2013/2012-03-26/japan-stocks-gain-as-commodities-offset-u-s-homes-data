The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  edged
up, rebounding from its biggest drop in two months, after Bank
of America Merrill Lynch said recent stock gains in  Japan  will
last until summer.  Kyocera Corp. (6971) , a Japanese electronics maker that gets
almost 20 percent of its sales in  Europe , rose 1.2 percent after
the yen weakened against the euro. Trading house Mitsubishi Corp.
gained 1.6 percent on higher commodities prices. Sumco Corp., a
silicon wafer maker, jumped 3.1 percent after Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. raised its estimate for dynamic random access memory
prices. Mitsumi Electric Co. sank 6.6 percent after its equity
rating was cut to “underweight.”  “There isn’t much news -- positive or negative -- to trade
on today and investors are finding it difficult to take
positions,” said  Ryuta Otsuka , a strategist at Toyo Securities
Co. in Tokyo. “Tomorrow is the last day to buy shares and still
get dividends for the current fiscal year, and we’re seeing
buying wind down.”  The Nikkei 225 edged up 0.1 percent to 10,018.24 at the 3
p.m. close in  Tokyo , after falling 1.1 percent on March 23, as
Merrill raised its estimate of the  Topix (TPX) ’s fair value to 950
from 900 to reflect a weaker yen. The  Bank of Japan ’s March
Tankan, to be published on April 2, “will show how far the
yen’s recent softening has fed into improved economic
sentiment,” according to a report by Merrill.  The broader Topix Index slid 0.1 percent to 851.82 after
rising as much as 0.4 percent earlier. Volume on the Topix was
27 percent lower than the 30-day average. Almost 80 percent of
the 1,668 companies listed on the gauge will go  ex-dividend  on
March 28.  Exporters gained. Kyocera climbed 1.2 percent to 7,570 yen.
Nissan Motor Co., a carmaker that gets about 80 percent of its
revenue from overseas, jumped 2.5 percent to 876 yen.  The yen depreciated to as low as 109.86 against the euro
today in Tokyo, compared with 109.32 at the close of  stock
trading  on March 23. Against the dollar, Japan’s currency
weakened to 82.95 from 81.98 around midnight. A weaker yen
boosts the value of overseas income at Japanese companies when
repatriated.  “More and more investors are coming to think that the yen
has completely stopped strengthening,” said  Kiyoshi Ishigane , a
Tokyo-based strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co.
which oversees　about $84 billion. “Compared with the 76 yen
level against the dollar in early February, exporters’
profitability is improving for sure.  Topix Gains  The  Topix (TPX)  has risen more than 8 percent since Feb. 14, when
the Bank of Japan increased its bond purchases, weakening the
yen. The  value  of stocks listed on the index has risen to 1.05
times book value, up from 0.88 in December, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A number below 1 means companies can be
bought for less than value of their assets.  Among stocks that gained,  Sumco (3436)  and other chip-related
companies rose after Goldman Sachs boosted its April-June
estimate for DRAM large-lot prices. The demand-supply balance on
DRAMs is improving after Elpida Memory Inc. went bankrupt,
Goldman said in report dated on March 23.  Sumco jumped 3.1 percent to 1,008 yen. Tokyo Electron,
Japan’s biggest manufacturer of chip-making equipment, gained
1.9 percent to 4,845 yen.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  added 0.2
percent today. Material and energy shares led the index’s 0.3
percent advance in  New York  on March 23, when crude oil climbed
$1.52 to settle at $106.87 a barrel.  The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial commodities including copper and aluminum added 0.7
percent on March 23, its first advance since March 19.  Mitsubishi gained 1.6 percent to 1,983 yen. Mitsubishi
Materials Corp., Japan’s third-largest copper producer, climbed
1.1 percent to 273 yen. Inpex Corp., the nation’s top oil
explorer by market value, rose 0.9 percent to 571,000 yen.  Among companies that fell, Mitsumi Electric fell  the most 
in the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  after Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities Co. cut
the investment rating on the electronic parts maker to
“underweight” from “equal-weight,” citing “stiffer
competition with Taiwanese firms” that makes console
controllers used for games. Mitsumi fell 6.6 percent to 723 yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
