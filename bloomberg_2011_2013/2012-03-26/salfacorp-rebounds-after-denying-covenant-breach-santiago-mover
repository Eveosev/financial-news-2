Salfacorp SA (SALFACOR) ,  Chile ’s largest
builder, jumped the most in four months in Santiago trading
after denying reports that it breached debt covenants.  The stock climbed 4.2 percent to 1,287 pesos at the close
in Santiago, the most since Nov. 28 and ending a five-day losing
streak.  The company doesn’t face imminent payments of guarantees on
building contracts, according to a written response to
regulators published after the close of trading March 23. The
shares fell 14 percent in the previous five days.  “We’ve contacted the company and they remain calm,” said
Alex Sadzawka, an analyst at Celfin Capital SA in Santiago. “If
last week’s fall was due to solvency concerns, then it should
have happened at the end of the third quarter, when Salfa showed
weaker figures than in the fourth quarter.”  Salfacorp had total current liabilities of 236 billion
pesos ($492 million) at the end of 2011, from 250 billion pesos
at the end of the third quarter, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The company’s so-called quick ratio -- which gauges
short-term liquidity by dividing current liabilities into cash,
cash equivalents and account receivables -- rose to 0.97 from
0.91 in the same period.  Celfin has a buy rating on the stock with a year-end price
target of 1,980 pesos, Sadzawka said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
