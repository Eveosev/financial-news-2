Iceland probably won’t conclude
negotiations on European Union membership before the island’s
next parliamentary elections scheduled to take place in April
2013, Foreign Minister Ossur Skarphedinsson said.  Iceland “is unlikely” to conclude negotiations with the
bloc before elections, Skarphedinsson told the  parliament’s 
foreign affairs committee in Reykjavik today. The chances of the
country managing to finish talks in the EU’s 35 policy areas in
the next 12 months are “improbable.”  Iceland started EU-entry talks in July 2010 and had aspired
to vote on accession in early 2013. Of a total of 35 negotiating
chapters for EU membership, Iceland has opened 11 and completed
eight, the EU said last week. The north Atlantic island is
expected to start and wrap up talks to adopt EU foreign and
consumer-protection policies on March 30, as well as opening
negotiations on competition policy and energy. The primary
challenges relate to agriculture, the environment and fisheries,
according to EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule.  A Capacent Gallup poll last month showed that 26.3 percent
of voters support membership, while 56.2 percent are against it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
