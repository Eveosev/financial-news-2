Tractor Supply Co. (TSCO) , owner of a
chain of farm-supply stores, rose to its highest level ever
after Cleveland Research Co. said 2012 same-store sales and
earnings may exceed the company’s own forecast.  Tractor Supply advanced 5.7 percent to $90.92 in New York,
for the highest close since the company went public in February
1994. The shares have risen 30  percent  this year.  Cleveland Research predicts same-store sales at the
Brentwood, Tennessee-based chain will increase 7 percent in
2012, above the 3 percent to 5 percent forecast Tractor Supply
gave in a February earnings statement. Cleveland Research also
estimates the company will report 2012 earnings per share of
$3.63, compared to Tractor Supply’s  prediction  of $3.38 to
$3.46, according to a note obtained by Bloomberg News.  “They’re executing a terrific business,” said Peter Benedict, an analyst with Robert W. Baird & Co. in  New York , who
rates Tractor Supply outperform. “They continue to benefit from
the early spring.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
