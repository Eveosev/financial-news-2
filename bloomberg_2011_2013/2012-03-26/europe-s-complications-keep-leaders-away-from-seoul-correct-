(Corrects spelling of spokesman’s name in second
paragraph.)  Europe ’s political complications
are keeping leaders away from a nuclear-security meeting in
Seoul, Summit spokesman Hahn Choong Hee said today at a briefing
in the South Korean capital.  “There are some political complications in the region and
because of that the leaders could not participate,” Hahn said.
United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron, French President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  and German Chancellor Angela Merkel aren’t
attending the two-day meeting.  Hahn didn’t elaborate about which political complications
are keeping the leaders away.  To contact the reporter on this story:
