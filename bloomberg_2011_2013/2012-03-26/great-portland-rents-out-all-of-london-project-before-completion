Great Portland (GPOR)  Estates Plc agreed
to rent out all of its 33 Margaret Street office development in
central London after reaching a deal with property broker
 Savills Plc. (SVS)   Savills agreed to pay annual rent of 7 million pounds ($11
million) for space in the property near Oxford Street, the
U.K.’s busiest shopping district, London-based Great Portland
said today in a statement.  “This deal continues GPE’s successful run of pre-lettings,
taking the total of recent lettings in development properties to
over 290,000 square feet,” Great Portland Chief Executive
Officer Toby Courtauld said in the statement.  The 95,600 square-foot (8,881 square-meter) Margaret Street
building will be completed in October and Savills will take 20-
year leases at an average annual rent of more than 73 pounds a
square foot. Great Portland had previously agreed to lease about
64,000 square feet of the building to the broker.  Great Portland, which focuses on  London ’s West End
district, held real estate valued at 1.9 billion pounds at the
end of last year, a gain of 45.9 million pounds from Sept. 30,
the company said last month. The increase was partly due to the
previously announced agreement with Savills.  To contact the reporter on this story:
