Nigerian police detained two
suspects after two shots were fired today in the vicinity of the
U.S. embassy in the capital, Abuja.  “We refer you to the Nigerian police for further
information,” Deborah MacLean, a spokeswoman for the embassy,
said in an e-mailed statement, without giving more information.
A spokesman for the police in Abuja, Moshood Jimoh, said by
phone he was unaware of the incident.  Abuja and the mainly Muslim north have seen a surge in
violence that has left more than 1,000 people dead since 2009.
Authorities in  Africa ’s top oil producer blame Boko Haram, which
draws inspiration from  Afghanistan ’s Taliban movement, for the
unrest.  Boko Haram, whose name means “Western education is a
sin,” claimed responsibility for the Aug. 26 suicide-bombing of
the United Nations building in the capital that left 24 dead and
for the bombing of a church near Abuja on Christmas Day that
killed 43 people.  Abul Qaqa, the purported spokesman for the group, said on
March 20 it is ruling out future talks with President Goodluck
Jonathan’s government, and called on all Muslims in  Nigeria  “to
join us in our struggle to Islamize Nigeria.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
