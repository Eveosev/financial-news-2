Nan Ya Plastics Corp. (1303) ,  Taiwan ’s
biggest maker of ethylene glycol and polyester, fell the most in
14 weeks in Taipei trading after announcing a lower-than-
expected full-year profit and a plan to cut dividend.  The shares declined 3.1 percent to NT$65.10 as of 11:56
a.m. local time, the most since Dec. 15. The  Taiex Index (TWSE)  lost
1.3 percent. The stock has advanced 8 percent this year,
trailing the 13 percent gain in the benchmark index.  Net income sank 44 percent to NT$23.1 billion ($780
million) last year, Nan Ya Plastics said in a statement on March
23. The average of 16 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg
News was for a profit of NT$28.4 billion. The company plans to
pay a cash dividend of NT$2.1 a share for 2011, compared with
NT$4.7 a year earlier.  “Declines in earnings and cash dividend negatively affect
investor interest in the stock,” Jun Liao, vice president at
Taipei-based Grand Cathay Investment Services Corp., said by
telephone today. Liao has an “underperform” rating on the
stock and expects the company to post a NT$28 billion profit
this year.  Nan Ya Plastics’ board also approved a proposal to sell as
much as NT$12 billion of unsecured bonds to repay debt and
improve its financial structure, according to a separate
statement. The company said it plans to invest an additional
$170 million in a Vietnamese steel venture, in which it owns a
21 percent stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
