The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. filling stations increased 11.49 cents to
$3.9297 a gallon, according to Lundberg Survey Inc.  The price jump covers the two-week period ended March 23
and is based on the Camarillo, California-based company’s survey
of about 2,500 stations. The price is almost 36 cents higher
than a year earlier, when the average was $3.5726, the survey
showed.  “There were refinery glitches that caused some wholesale
markets to jump,”  Trilby Lundberg , the president of Lundberg
Survey, said in a telephone interview yesterday. “We also went
to daylight savings that adds another hour for motorists”
increasing demand, she said.  With the U.S. jobs market and manufacturing showing
improvement, higher pump prices before the peak summer driving
season have become an issue in the 2012 U.S. presidential
election. U.K. Business Secretary  Vince Cable  reiterated March
23 that Britain is in talks with the Obama administration and
with other nations about a coordinated release of strategic oil
reserves to bring down prices.  The Obama administration has said it’s monitoring prices in
360 U.S. cities to guard against fraud or price manipulation.
The president announced on March 22 in Cushing,  Oklahoma , the
delivery point for New York futures contracts, that he has
ordered an expedited review of an oil pipeline project that
would connect Cushing to refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast.  Republican House Speaker  John Boehner ’s office labeled the
president’s trip a “tour de farce,” and Republican
presidential candidate  Mitt Romney  said Obama’s move was more
about his poll numbers than oil.  Oil Prices  Fuel prices rose as West Texas Intermediate crude in New
York has gained 8.1 percent this year and Brent oil in London
has surged 16 percent. The front-month crude contract on the
Nymex fell 53 cents to $106.81 a barrel in the two weeks ended
March 23, while Brent oil in  London  declined 85 cents to
$125.13.  Gasoline futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  rose
1.6 percent to $3.3852 a gallon in the two weeks ended March 23.
That’s the highest settlement since April 29, when prices
reached $3.4648, the highest closing price of 2011.  Futures have climbed 26 percent this year, making gasoline
the best performer in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24
commodities. Prices have surged on speculation that refinery
closings will tighten supplies and as crude rose on concern that
tensions with  Iran  over its nuclear program would reduce oil
supplies.  Gasoline Inventories  U.S.  gasoline stockpiles  fell 1.21 million barrels to a 10-
week low of 226.9 million in the week ended March 16, according
to Energy Department data. Gasoline demand over the prior four
weeks was  7.8 percent below  a year earlier.  Retail demand this year through March 16 was 5.6 percent
lower than the same period in 2011, according to  MasterCard (MA) 
Inc.’s SpendingPulse report on March 20. That’s the biggest
decline for this time of the year in SpendingPulse records,
dating back to 2004.  “If crude oil prices don’t spike right now there’s a very
good chance that retail prices may peak,” Lundberg said. “It
would take another crude oil spike to send retail prices up
further.”  Oil may decrease next week after U.S. fuel consumption
declined and  Saudi Arabia  said it can increase output
immediately, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Seventeen of 30 analysts, or 57 percent, forecast oil will
fall through March 30. Four respondents, or 13 percent,
predicted prices will rise and nine estimated there will be
little change. Last week, 53 percent expected a decline.  The highest price in the lower 48 U.S. states among the
cities surveyed was in  Chicago  where the average was $4.56 a
gallon Lundberg said. The lowest price was in Tulsa, where
customers paid an average of $3.58 a gallon.  On  Long Island , regular gasoline increased to $4.05 a
gallon, according to Lundberg. Los Angeles-area retail stations
averaged $4.34.  To contact the reporter on this story:
