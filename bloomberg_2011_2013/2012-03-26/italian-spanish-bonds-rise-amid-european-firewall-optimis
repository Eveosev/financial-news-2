Spanish  government bonds  advanced,
reducing yield spreads over similar-maturity German bunds, as
euro-area ministers prepared a deal to bolster the region’s
financial firewall and protect indebted nations.  Germany’s bonds fell for the first time in five days after
an index of business confidence unexpectedly rose to an eight-
month high in March and the nation sold 2.7 billion euros ($3.6
billion) of 12-month bills.  France ’s two-year note yields
dropped to a record low. It sold 6.9 billion euros of 84-, 161-
day and 343-day bills.  Yields “are slightly lower because we had positive news, a
few reports out there that Germany will accept the firewall,”
said Achilleas Georgolopoulos, a fixed-income strategist at
Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets in  London .  Spanish 10-year bonds advanced for a second day, pushing
the yield down four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to
5.33 percent at 4:20 p.m. London time. The 5.85 percent security
due January 2022 rose 0.34, or 3.40 euros per 1,000-euro face
amount, to 103.9.  The extra yield investors demand to hold the securities
over benchmark 10-year German bunds fell 12 basis points to 338
basis points. The Italian-German yield spread narrowed nine
basis points to 308.  Bailout Funds  Euro-area leaders have established two bailout funds, the
temporary European Financial Stability Facility and the
permanent 500 billion-euro European Stability Mechanism, which
is scheduled to begin operations this year. German Chancellor
Angela Merkel today signaled she is prepared to allow an
increase in the debt-crisis firewall, saying  Germany  could let
the funds run in parallel.  European Union finance ministers meet in Copenhagen
starting on March 30.  The German 10-year yield surged eight basis points to 1.95
percent after dropping 19 basis points last week, the most since
the five days ended Dec. 16.  The Munich-based Ifo institute said today its  business
climate index , based on a survey of 7,000 executives, increased
to 109.8 from a revised 109.7 in February. Economists forecast
it would remain unchanged at the initial February reading of
109.6, according to the median of 44 estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey.  The French two-year  note yield  was at 0.45 percent, having
earlier slid to 0.435 percent, the least since Bloomberg began
collecting the data in 1990.  Spanish elections  Spanish bonds were among the majority of euro-area
securities that outperformed bunds even after the nation’s
ruling  People’s Party  failed to dislodge the Socialists in a
vote in the region of Andalusia, undermining Prime Minister
 Mariano Rajoy  as he seeks to cut the deficit.  Only Dutch and Greek government debt underperformed bunds,
with the Netherlands’s 10-year yield climbing eight basis points
to 2.53 percent. Volatility on Dutch bonds was the highest in
euro-area markets followed by Finland and Germany, according to
measures of 10-year bonds, two- and 10-year yield spreads and
credit-default swaps. The change in the 10-year yield was 8.2
times the 90-day average.  Greek government bonds due February 2023 dropped, pushing
the yield on the securities up 14 basis points to 20.24 percent.
The price fell to 24.675 percent of face value, the lowest since
the bonds were issued, according to closing prices.  Greece ’s 30-year bonds advanced, with the yield dropping 51
basis points to 17.40 percent. The nation said on March 23 it
would extend the deadline for holders of foreign-law securities
to participate in its debt swap.  Bund Futures  German bunds have lost 0.1 percent over the past year,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. French bonds have
gained 1.9 percent and Spanish securities have risen 1 percent,
the indexes show.  German 10-year bund futures may fall toward a three-month
low, Societe Generale SA said, citing trading patterns.  “Last week’s bounce on the 135.22-27 support area probably
aimed to consolidate the impressive decline that started at
139.06 in mid-March,”  Ciaran O’Hagan , head of euro-area rate
strategy in Paris, wrote in an e-mailed report. “In that case,
the 137.67-75 gap should force the bund to return to 135.22-27,
with a first step at 136.63.”  The 136.63 level is the first support for the securities,
O’Hagan wrote, referring to an area on a graph where technical
analysts anticipate buy orders to be clustered.  The bund contract expiring in June slipped to 136.72 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
