Ukrainian spring-grain planting is
lagging behind year-earlier rates, agricultural researcher
UkrAgroConsult said.  Early spring grains covered 116,000 hectares (286,642
acres) as of March 22, mainly in Crimea and the Odessa region in
the countryâ€™s south, the Kiev-based  researcher  said today in an
e-mailed statement. That compares with 156,000 hectares at the
same date last year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
