Nigeria ’s National Council on
Privatization approved Manitoba Hydro Electric Board of Canada
as the network operator for the state-owned power utility,
 Transmission Co. of Nigeria , the presidency said.  Manitoba Hydro and Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. on
Feb. 29 submitted bids for the power utility. After bids were
evaluated on March 9, “only Manitoba Hydro International was
able to meet the benchmark which led to it being appointed as
the management contractor for Transmission Company of Nigeria,”
the Abuja-based presidency said in an e-mailed statement today.  Manitoba Hydro will be invited for “opening of their
financial proposal and the commencement of contract negotiations
as the management contractor,” it said.  Nigeria plans to divest majority holdings in state power
utilities as it seeks investment to curb daily blackouts.
Manitoba Hydro and  Power Grid  are two of three companies that
were shortlisted to manage the network in 2007. The government
later suspended the sale before inviting the companies to re-
submit bids in 2010.  Blackouts are a daily occurrence in Nigeria,  Africa ’s most
populous country with more than 160 million people, where demand
for electricity exceeds current supply, according to the Power
Ministry.  Africa’s top oil producer plans to sell majority holdings
in state power utilities as it seeks investment to reduce
blackouts. The program includes six state-owned electricity
producers and 11 heating utilities to be sold this year. Nigeria
will announce the winning bidders for 17 state-owned power
companies in October, the West African nation’s privatization
agency said on Feb. 20.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
