Lamprell Plc (LAM) , a U.K. oil and gas
rig engineer, said it may be able to increase profit margins as
global exploration heats up.  “We see more demand across the board,” Chief Executive
Officer Nigel McCue said in a telephone interview. “As capacity
becomes constrained, we’re able to improve margins.”  The shares of the Douglas, Isle of Man-based company rose
3.9 percent to 350 pence after it reported a 11 percent gain in
net income, excluding exceptional charges, to $73.8 million for
2011. The order book was $1.2 billion at the end of the year.  Oil prices  exceeding $120 a barrel are encouraging
companies to find new sources of crude. The number of oil and
gas rigs operating worldwide rose 10 percent last month from a
year earlier, according to data published by  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)   To contact the reporter on this story:
