China Minsheng Banking Corp. (1988) , the
nation’s first non-state lender, is set to sell shares at
HK$6.79 each in a Hong Kong offering, according to a person
familiar with the matter.  The person declined to be identified as the process is
private. The Beijing-based bank planned to raise as much as
HK$11.3 billion ($1.45 billion), offering 1.65 billion shares at
HK$6.65 to HK$6.86 apiece, according to terms for the deal
obtained by Bloomberg News.  A call to the lender outside of regular business hours
wasn’t answered.  Minsheng joins local rivals  Bank of Communications Co.  and
 Industrial Bank Co. (1398)  in seeking funds after a two-year, $2.7
trillion  lending spree  weakened their finances.  China ’s banking
regulator is planning tougher  capital requirements  for lenders
to fend off rising credit risks.  The China Banking Regulatory Commission said in August that
it would require the country’s largest, or so-called
systemically important, lenders to have a minimum capital
adequacy ratio of 11.5 percent by the end of next year. Smaller
banks would be required to have at least 10.5 percent under
“normal conditions” by the end of 2016, the CBRC had said.  Minsheng’s  capital adequacy ratio  stood at 10.86 percent as
of Dec. 31, while the core ratio was 7.87 percent. Both are the
lowest among the nine publicly-traded Chinese lenders listed in
Hong Kong.  The lender, which has about 590 outlets nationwide, was
founded in 1996 by pig-feed tycoon Liu Yonghao and some of
China’s wealthiest businessmen. The bank has boosted profit by
an average 50 percent since 2007 by focusing on smaller
enterprises. Profit surged 59 percent to 27.9 billion yuan last
year on higher income from lending and fee-based services.  To contact the reporters on this story:
