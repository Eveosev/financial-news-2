The cost of insuring against
default on European corporate debt fell, according to BNP
Paribas SA.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 6.5 basis points to
591.5 basis points. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125
companies with investment-grade ratings fell 1.5 basis points to
116.75. A decline signals improvement in perceptions of  credit
quality .  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers fell two basis points to 208 and the
subordinated index declined 3.5 to 324.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
