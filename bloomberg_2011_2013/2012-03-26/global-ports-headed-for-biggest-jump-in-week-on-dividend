Global Ports Investment Plc headed
for its biggest gain in a week after the London-listed operator
of container terminals in  Russia  recommended an additional
dividend payout totaling $32.9 million after profit rose 23
percent last year.  The depositary receipts added 2.7 percent to $15.05 as of
12:20 p.m. in Moscow, their first gain in a week. A close at
that level would mark their strongest increase since March 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
