Morgan Stanley (MS) ’s P2 Value fund sold
its majority stake in the Frankfurt Trianon office and
residential complex as part of a plan to shut down the fund and
dispose of its assets.  P2 sold its 57 percent stake in the development to a unit
of Madison International Realty and Art-Invest Real Estate for
an undisclosed price, New-York based Madison said today in a
statement.  The complex in Frankfurt’s financial district includes a
47-story office tower and residential buildings and is 85
percent occupied, according to the statement. Morgan Stanley’s
Eurozone Office Fund owns the rest of the Trianon.  In October 2010, Morgan Stanley said it would shut down the
P2 fund and sell its 34 properties in Europe, Japan,  Hong Kong 
and the U.S. within three years. The New York-based bank closed
the fund after it failed to raise enough from asset sales to
repay investors before a redemption deadline.  “Structural changes, such as currently experienced by
open-end real estate funds, as an example, offer interesting
investment opportunities to Madison,” Michael Seifert, managing
director at Madison’s German unit, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
