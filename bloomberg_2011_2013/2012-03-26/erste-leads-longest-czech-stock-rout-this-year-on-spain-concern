Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  of Austria led
Czech shares toward their longest stretch of losses this year as
Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  warned Spain’s struggle to
control its finances may reignite Europe’s debt crisis.  The stock slid 1.3 percent to 448 koruna by 11:34 a.m. in
Prague. The 14-member  PX (PX)  index, where Erste has a 19 percent
weighting, retreated 0.3 percent. A close at that level would be
the lowest since Feb. 1 and the longest selloff since Dec. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
