New World Resources Plc (NWR)  jumped the
most in five weeks after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said an accommodative monetary policy is still needed
in the worldâ€™s largest economy, spurring demand for commodities.  The biggest Czech producer of coking coal rose as much as
5.5 percent, the most since Feb. 17, and traded up 4.4 percent
to 135.6 koruna by 4:05 p.m. in Prague. NWR has been rebounding
from a three-month intraday low reached in the previous session.  To contact the reporter on this story:
