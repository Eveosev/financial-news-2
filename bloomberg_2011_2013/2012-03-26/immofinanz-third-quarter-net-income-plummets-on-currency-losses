Immofinanz AG (IIA) , eastern  Europe ’s
biggest real-estate company, said third-quarter profit plummeted
because the euro’s strength led to valuation losses on loans and
derivatives.  Net income fell to 6.3 million euros ($8.3 million) in the
three months to Jan. 31 from 123 million euros a year earlier,
the Vienna-based company said in a  report  today. Rental income
climbed 5 percent to 153.6 million euros.  “In spite of the volatility on financial and capital
markets, we continue to expect stable development” in the rest
of fiscal 2012, which ends April 30, the company said in a
statement. Immofinanz was hurt by the euro’s gain against the
currencies of countries including Russia and  Poland .  The Austrian company with projects including the GoodZone
mall in Moscow and the Gerling Quarter in Cologne,  Germany ,
reinstated dividends last year after a four-year hiatus in which
it came close to collapse. Chief Executive Officer Eduard Zehetner, who led Immofinanz’s rescue, is now focusing on fewer
countries.  Earnings excluding currency changes fell to 54 million
euros from 151 million euros, Immofinanz said.  The company today reiterated a plan to pay a dividend of 15
cents a share for the year. Immofinanz climbed 0.5 percent to
2.74 euros at 10:42 a.m. in Vienna, while the Bloomberg Europe
Real Estate Index was little changed. The shares have risen 18
percent this year, while the index has advanced 11 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
