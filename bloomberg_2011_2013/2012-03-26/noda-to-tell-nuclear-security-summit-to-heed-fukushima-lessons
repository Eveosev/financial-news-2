Japanese Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  will tell world leaders gathered in Seoul for a nuclear
security summit to heed the lessons from the meltdown at the
Fukushima Dai-Ichi power plant.  Japan  failed firstly to anticipate the scale of potential
threats, with a tsunami measuring more than 15 meters high on
March 11 last year overwhelming sea walls built to cope with a
surge one-third that size, the prime minister will say,
according to a draft statement provided by his office.  Noda, who became leader last year after the event, will
also emphasize that a lack of communication between authorities
prevented a quick response and that nations must ensure their
police, armed forces and civilian agencies share information and
training. Fukushima showed that overconfidence and a dogmatic
approach to safety are dangerous, he will say.  “These are the warnings that can be applied not only to an
accident caused by a natural disaster, but also to terrorist
attacks on atomic facilities,” Noda will say, according to the
document.  World leaders including U.S. President  Barack Obama ,
Chinese President Hu Jintao and Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev  are gathered in Seoul for the two-day summit, which
ends today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
