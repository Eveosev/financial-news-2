The euro pared its decline against
the dollar after the Munich-based Ifo instituteâ€™s German
business climate index unexpectedly increased in March.  The euro traded little changed at $1.3262 at 9:05 a.m.
London time after dropping as much as 0.3 percent. It rose 0.4
percent to 109.71 yen.  The Ifo said its index, based on a survey of 7,000
executives, rose to 109.8 from a revised 109.7 in February.
Economists forecast it would remain unchanged at the initial
February reading of 109.6, according to the median of 44
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
