Embraer SA (EMBR3) , the world’s fourth-
biggest airplane maker, said it expects the U.S. government to
seek new bids within weeks on a contract for light attack
aircraft that was taken from the company in February.  Embraer thinks it has a great chance of winning the work
again if the contract requirements are maintained, a company
press officer said, citing its defense division president, Luiz Carlos Aguiar.  Aguiar said the U.S. decision needs to be made before
Sept. 30, when the budget allocation for purchasing the planes
expires, according to the press officer, who asked not to be
identified because of the  Sao Jose dos Campos , Brazil-based
aircraft maker’s policy.  Embraer and its American partner, Sierra Nevada Corp., won
a $355 million contract in December to sell 20 Super Tucano
aircraft to the U.S. Air Force for use in  Afghanistan . The award
was canceled Feb. 28 after losing competitor Hawker Beechcraft
Corp. sued the military over the decision.  Aguiar said Embraer’s defense division has a backlog of
$3.5 billion and will end 2012 with sales of $950 million, an
increase from $868 million last year, according to the press
officer.  The Financial Times reported Embraer’s expectation for the
timing of the new bidding earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
