Even after the worst rout since
2010, the U.S. bond market shows the economy is unlikely to
maintain its strength without help from the  Federal Reserve .  While the Fed triggered this month’s 2.2 percent loss in
10-year Treasuries when policy makers raised their assessment of
the economy following a March 13 meeting, everything from
derivatives to mortgage securities indicates that investors
don’t expect a repeat of the bear markets seen in 1994 and 2009,
two of the worst years ever for bonds.  Declining  unemployment , rising consumer confidence and
strength in manufacturing may give way to more sluggish growth
as George W. Bush-era tax breaks end and $1 trillion of
mandatory federal budget cuts kick in. Even with oil back above
$100 a barrel, the Fed’s preferred measure of gauging the
outlook for inflation shows consumer prices will rise at half
the pace of 2008 when it accelerated to 5.6 percent.  “We’ve seen this story in 2010 and 2011, where it looks
pretty good in the first half and then we have to change our
tune in the second half,” said Robert Tipp, the chief
investment strategist in  Newark ,  New Jersey , at Prudential
Financial Inc., which oversees $300 billion in bonds.  Tipp spoke in a March 20 telephone interview, the same day
that 10-year Treasury yields rose to 2.4 percent, the highest
level since October. Prudential favors corporate bonds and
longer-term debt, expecting yields to fall, he said.  Rising Debt Load  President  Barack Obama  needs the support of the bond market
to help finance a  budget deficit  projected to exceed $1 trillion
for the fourth year. U.S. borrowing costs have remained low even
though the amount of marketable  debt outstanding  has more than
doubled to $10.2 trillion from $4.34 trillion in mid-2007 as the
government sold bonds to pay for spending programs designed to
pull the economy out of the worst financial crisis since the
Great Depression.  The Fed and Chairman Ben S. Bernanke helped by cutting
 interest rates  to a record low of zero to 0.25 percent, and
purchasing $2.3 trillion of bonds in two rounds of policy called
quantitative easing, or QE.  Bill Gross , who runs the world’s biggest bond fund at
Pacific Investment Management Co., said the central bank will
probably signal plans to arrange a third round of debt purchases
when policy makers meet in April. The Fed is “likely to hint”
at QE3 at its April 25 gathering, Gross wrote on Twitter.  No ‘Easing Up’  Housing reports last week showed a key part of the economy
remains under pressure. The Commerce Department said March 23
new  home sales  fell to a 313,000 annual pace in February, the
slowest since October, from the 318,000 rate in January that was
weaker than previously reported. Earlier in the week the
National Association of Realtors said existing-home sales eased
to a 4.59 million rate last month from January’s 4.63 million.  “It’s hard for me to imagine that they’re going risk
seeing the economy decelerate in the second half as a result of
them easing up on stimulus,” Prudential’s Tipp said in
reference to the Fed and speculation the central bank may need
to tighten monetary policy sooner than 2014 to contain
inflation.  Bonds rebounded last week, with benchmark 10-year note
yields falling five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to
2.23 percent, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It was
four basis points higher at 2.27 percent at 8:13 a.m.  New York 
time. The 2 percent security due February 2022 fell 10/32, or
$3.13 per $1,000 face amount, to 97 20/32.  ‘Desperate for Yield’  Ten-year yields are up from 1.97 percent at the end of
February, and this year’s low of 1.79 percent on Jan. 31.
Investors in Treasuries have lost 1.4 percent this quarter
including reinvested interest, set for the biggest drop since
losing 2.67 percent in the final three months of 2010, the Bank
of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Treasury Master Index shows.  “People are desperate for yield, and Treasuries don’t have
yield,” Donald Ellenberger, who oversees about $10 billion as
co-head of government and mortgage-backed securities at
Federated Investors Inc. in Pittsburgh, said in a March 22
telephone interview. “Instead of being the risk-free rate,
they’re return-free risk right now.”  Federated insulated itself from the losses by shifting to
an underweight position in Treasuries at the end of 2011,
meaning it owns a smaller percentage of the securities than is
contained in benchmark indexes, Ellenberger said.  Signs that the economy is gaining traction have led
investors to shun bonds in favor of riskier assets such as
stocks. The  Standard & Poor’s  500 index advanced 11.6 percent
this year, including dividends.  Recovery Signs  Reports in the past month have shown the  unemployment rate 
falling to 8.3 percent, the lowest level since February 2009,
the Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index rising to a four-year high
and the  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index
signaling an expansion in manufacturing for the 31st straight
month.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  said in a statement at
the conclusion of its March 13 meeting in  Washington  that it now
expects “moderate economic growth” and predicted the
unemployment rate “will decline gradually.” In its prior
statement in January, the FOMC said growth would be “modest”
and unemployment “will decline only gradually.”  Fed’s Preferred Gauge  It also said oil will “push up inflation temporarily, but
the committee anticipates that subsequently inflation will run
at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its
dual mandate” of promoting maximum employment and stable
prices.  The  bond market  agrees. The  five-year, five-year  forward
breakeven rate, which projects the pace of consumer price
increases starting in 2017, ended last week at 2.73 percent.  While the measure, which the Fed prefers to look at in
determining inflation expectations and monetary policy, is up
from this year’s low of 2.37 percent on March 5, it’s in line
with the average over the past decade. It’s also below the 3.63
percent level reached in the wake of Lehman Brothers Holding
Inc.’s collapse on speculation the Fed would flood the economy
with cash and spark runaway inflation.  The difference between yields on 10- and 30-year Treasuries
also suggests less concern about faster inflation. Amid the
selloff the gap has shrunk to 1.07 percentage points from this
year’s peak of 1.2 percentage points on Feb. 3.  Annual Losses  The spread typically widens when traders are concerned that
inflation will accelerate because investors demand more
compensation to own long-term bonds. In 2008, when the  consumer
price index  rose to 5.6 percent from 2 percent in 2007, the gap
in yields expanded to 1.01 percentage points from about 0.08
percentage point.  Improvements in the labor market have yet to spur wage
inflation. Average hourly earnings rose 1.9 percent in February
from a year earlier, down from an average of 3.2 percent in 2008
and 3.7 percent in January 2009, Labor Department data show.  While he’s encouraged by the unemployment rate’s decline, 
continued accommodative monetary policy will be needed to make
further progress, Bernanke said today.  The drop in unemployment may reflect “a reversal of the
unusually large layoffs that occurred during late 2008 and over
2009,” Bernanke said in a speech in Arlington, Virginia. “To the
extent that this reversal has been completed, further significant
improvements in the unemployment rate will likely require a more-
apid expansion of production and demand from consumers and
businesses, a process that can be supported by continued
accommodative policies.”  Most Accurate  The Treasury market posted annual losses only three times
over the past 30 years, according to the Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes. The last time was in 2009, when it tumbled 3.72
percent as the  S&P 500  soared 23.5 percent.  In 1999, the market lost 2.38 percent as the Fed raised its
 target rate  for overnight loans between banks to 5.5 percent
from 4.75 percent. Losses totaled 3.35 percent in 1994 as the
central bank boosted rates to 6 percent from 3 percent.  For the most accurate forecaster of Treasury yields, 2012
will probably look more like 2010 and 2011, when bonds tumbled
early before recovering as growth slowed.  “The employment data will probably stay strong up until
May,” Christopher Low, the chief economist at FTN Financial in
New York, said in a March 16 interview. “After that, I don’t
think it can be sustained. People tend to start hiring more in
the spring time.”  Low, who was the only one among 70 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey at the start of 2011 who predicted 10-year yields would
fall to 2 percent by the end of that year, said they will remain
in a range of 1.8 percent to 2.3 percent in 2012.  Gross domestic product will expand 2.2 percent this year,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of 72 economists. That’s
slower than the 3.1 percent posted in 2005 and 2.7 percent in
2006 before the recession and financial crisis.  Hedging Costs Fall  Traders are paying less to hedge against rising 10-year
yields during the next three years, as measured by options on
interest-rate swaps. The so-called payer skew has fallen 4 cents
since March 9, while that for three-month protection rose about
3 cents, according to Barclays Plc data. Each 10 cents is
equivalent to $100,000.  “The options market does not expect a further violent rise
in rates,” Piyush Goyal, a fixed-income strategist in New York
at Barclays, said in a March 22 telephone interview. “If the
option market believed in a very large back-up in yields similar
to what we got in final quarter of 2010 when rates went from 2.5
percent to 3.5 percent, the payer skews would have risen more.”  Mortgages Outperform  Credit-default swaps back that view. The cost of insuring
the U.S. government’s debt from losses for five years with the
contracts fell to 30.3 basis points last week, the lowest level
since 2009 and down from a 2012 high of 51.5 basis points on
Jan. 5.  Rather than lagging behind, mortgage securities are
outperforming in part on speculation that the Fed may carry out
a third round of quantitative easing focused on debt backed by
home loans to bolster the housing market.  The option-adjusted spread between mortgage bonds and
Treasuries narrowed to 0.29 percentage point on March 22 from
0.44 percentage point at the end of 2011, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes. The securities have produced a
return in  excess  of Treasuries of 0.45 percentage point this
month, the most since December 2010, Barclays index data show.  “At 8.3 percent unemployment, has the Fed achieved what it
was trying to?” David Glocke, a bond fund manager at Vanguard
Group Inc. in  Valley Forge ,  Pennsylvania , said in a March 21
telephone interview. Vanguard’s $138.1 billion in Treasuries
makes it the largest U.S. owner of the debt after the Fed.  “I don’t think  Ben Bernanke  is going to feel that he’s hit
that target yet if things stay where they are,” Glocke said.
“More likely than not, there’s probably some additional amount
of quantitative easing that’s in the future.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
