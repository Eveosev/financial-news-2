Spanish 10-year bonds advanced,
reducing the extra yield investors demand to hold the securities
over similar-maturity German bunds for a second day.  Spain â€™s 10-year yield slid four basis points to 5.33
percent at 8:06 a.m. London time, narrowing the spread over
bunds by six basis points to 345 basis points.  The two-year Spanish note also rose, pushing the yield down
three basis points to 2.48 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
