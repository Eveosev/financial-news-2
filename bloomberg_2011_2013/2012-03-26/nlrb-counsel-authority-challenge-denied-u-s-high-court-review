The U.S. Supreme Court declined to
hear a challenge to the power of the  National Labor Relations
Board ’s general counsel to bring complaints when the board lacks
a quorum.  The justices today rejected an appeal from a  hotel  in
Waikiki, Honolulu, which claimed the NLRB wrongfully brought a
complaint on behalf of International Longshore and Warehouse
Union Local 142 over unfair labor practices. The hotel claimed
the board isn’t allowed to pass its authority to its general
counsel when it lacks a quorum.  The court in 2010 said the NLRB, which had operated for 27
months with only two of its five seats filled, needed at least
three members to issue decisions. Voting 5-4, the justices said
Congress didn’t authorize the board to act with only two
members.  Anticipating membership would fall below the required
quorum, the board in November 2011 “temporarily” delegated its
powers to the general counsel on legal matters that would
normally require the board’s approval.  The hotel asked the high court to review the case in light
of a dispute over whether the board can even bring complaints.
With only two members confirmed by the Senate and facing
gridlock over other nominations, President Barack Obama in
January appointed three members before seeking Senate
confirmation, asserting that Congress was in recess. Those
appointments are separately being challenged in other courts
with Republicans arguing that Congress was still in session.  The case is HTH Corp. v Frankl, 11-622.  To contact the reporter on this story:
