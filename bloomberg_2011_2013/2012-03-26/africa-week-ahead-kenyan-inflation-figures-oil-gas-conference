Kenya is scheduled to announce its
latest inflation data from March 29.  Price growth  in  East
Africa ’s biggest economy slowed for the third straight month in
February to 16.7 percent.  Kenya hosts the third Eastern Africa Oil, Gas & Energy
Week, which begins today and continues until March 28. Speakers
include representatives from  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , Africa Oil Corp.,
KenolKobil Ltd. along with government officials from countries
including Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and  Mozambique .  Results from  Senegal ’s runoff election, in which President
Abdoulaye Wade yesterday faced his former ally, Macky Sall, are
expected to be announced this week. Wade may fail in his bid to
secure a third term after the opposition rallied behind a single
candidate, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit.
