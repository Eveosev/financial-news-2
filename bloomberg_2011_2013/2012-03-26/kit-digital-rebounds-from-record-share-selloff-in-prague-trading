Kit Digital Inc. (KITD) , a maker of online
video software, rose the most in 2 1/2 months in Czech trading
on speculation a record plunge last week was overdone.  The stock rose as much as 12 percent, its biggest intraday
increase since Jan. 6, before trading up 6.5 percent at 123.49
koruna by 12:26 p.m. in Prague. That made Kit the biggest gainer
in the 14-member  PX (PX)  index, which fell 0.2 percent today.  Kit slumped 27 percent in the previous session, the most
since cross-listing its New York-traded shares on the Czech
stock exchange in January 2010, after the company said it
accepted the resignations of four board members, with three
remaining as managers with the company. The stock slid 22
percent to $6.33 on the  Nasdaq  that day even as Kit reaffirmed
its earlier earnings outlook for this year.  “The big stock-price reaction was unjustified,” Ondrej
Moravansky, an analyst at Cyrrus AS in Brno,  Czech Republic ,
wrote in a report to clients today. “While personnel changes in
the highest posts are clearly important and a negative signal
for investors, the company confirmed its outlook and all major
members of the management are staying.”  Kit’s plunge on March 23 sent the 14-day relative strength
 index  to 15.7 in Czech trading, the lowest in seven months.
Readings lower than 30 suggest to technical analysts that a
security may rise. The RSI last stood at 22.3 in Prague.  To contact the reporter on this story:
