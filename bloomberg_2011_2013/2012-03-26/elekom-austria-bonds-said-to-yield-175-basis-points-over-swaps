Telekom Austria AG (TKA) , Austriaâ€™s
former telephone monopoly, is selling 750 million euros ($1
billion) of 10-year bonds, according to a banker with knowledge
of the deal.  The notes will be priced to yield 175 basis points more
than the benchmark mid-swap rate, according to another banker.  Telekom Austria is selling the bonds as part of a new 2.5
billion-euro euro medium-term note program, it said in a
statement today, adding that it was selling a 10-year benchmark-
sized senior unsecured bond via its finance subsidiary, Telekom
Finanzmanagement GmbH.  The telephone company held a call with bond investors
organized by BNP Paribas SA, Erste Group Bank AG, Raiffeisen
Bank International AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
earlier today, according to two other people with knowledge of
the arrangements.  Telekom Austria  currently has three outstanding bonds, due
2013, 2016 and 2017, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The 750 million-euro 2013 bond has a coupon of 5 percent, the
750 million-euro 2016 bond has a 6.375 percent coupon, while the
500 million-euro 2017 bond has a coupon of 4.25 percent,
according to the data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
