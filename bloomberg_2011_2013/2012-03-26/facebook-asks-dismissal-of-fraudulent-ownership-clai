Facebook Inc. (FB) , the world’s biggest
social network, asked a judge to dismiss  Paul Ceglia ’s ownership
claim, calling it a fraud on the court.  Ceglia, a western New York man, claims that a 2003 contract
with Facebook’s co-founder, Mark Zuckerberg, gave him half the
company when it was started the following year. Ceglia says he
is now entitled to half of Zuckerberg’s holdings.  Facebook, based in  Menlo Park , California, accuses Ceglia
of forging the contract and creating phony e-mails to support
his claim. In papers in federal court in Buffalo, New York, the
company today asked to have the case thrown out.  Facebook filed documents with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission last month to raise $5 billion in an initial
public offering. It’s worth an estimated $93.6 billion,
according to SharesPost.com, which tracks nonpublic companies.  The case is Ceglia v. Zuckerberg, 1:10-cv-00569, U.S.
District Court, Western District of  New York  (Buffalo).  To contact the reporter on this story:
