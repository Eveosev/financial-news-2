Japanese  stock   futures  and
Australian equities rose after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said accommodative monetary policy is still needed and
a report showed German business confidence unexpectedly gained,
improving the earnings outlook for Asian exporters.  American depositary receipts of  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , Japan’s
second-largest carmaker by market value that gets 83 percent of
its sales abroad, rose 0.9 percent from the closing share price
in Tokyo. ADRs of  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) , Japan’s
second-biggest lender by market value, added 2.4 percent after
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  signaled she stands ready to do
more to tame Europe’s debt crisis. Australian mining company  Rio
Tinto Group (RIO)  climbed 0.7 percent after it finished a $7 billion
share buy-back program and metal prices rose.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
June closed at 10,050 in Chicago yesterday, up from 9,960 in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 10,050 in Osaka
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained
0.9 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index advanced 0.4
percent in Wellington.  Fed policy makers “still have an option of doing more, but
I think it was just reinforcing the view that they are not going
to reverse policy quickly,” said  Stephen Halmarick , Sydney-
based head of investment markets research at Colonial First
State Global Asset Management, which oversees about $150
billion. “There’s going to be a lot of liquidity provided for
the market and economy. Obviously equity investors are taking it
in a positive way.”  Bernanke Comments  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  were little
changed today. The index added 1.4 percent in  New York  yesterday
to close at the highest level since May 2008 after Bernanke said
that while he is encouraged by a drop in the unemployment rate,
the Fed needs to continue accommodative monetary policy to make
further progress.  Chinese equities traded in the U.S. advanced for a second
day on prospects further U.S. monetary policy easing will spur
demand for goods from the world’s biggest exporter. The
Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded Chinese
shares in the U.S. climbed 1.1 percent to a nine-day high of
105.70 yesterday in New York.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 0.9 percent as the
Munich-based Ifo institute said its German business climate
index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives, increased to 109.8
from a revised 109.7 in February. Economists forecast it would
remain unchanged at the initial February reading of 109.6,
according to the median of estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Debt-Crisis Firewall  Separately, German  Chancellor Merkel  gave her first
indication that she is prepared to allow an increase in the
debt-crisis firewall, saying that Germany could let the
temporary and permanent rescue funds run in parallel.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 10.4 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 12.6 percent gain by the S&P
500 and a 9.6 percent advance by the Stoxx 600 Index. Stocks in
the Asian benchmark are valued at 14.8 times estimated earnings
on average, compared with 13.6 times for the S&P 500 and 11.2
times for the Stoxx 600.  The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
