Mauritius is seeking the supply of
65,000 metric tons of liquefied petroleum gas in the year to
June 2013, the nation’s state-owned trading company said.  The deadline for submission of tenders is April 24,
according to  documents  posted on the website of the State
Trading Corp. The volume supplied can be as much as 10 percent
more or less than the 65,000-ton figure.  LPG is used in about 98 percent of the Indian Ocean
nation’s households, Megh Pillay, chief executive officer said
today in a phone interview. “The mature market may regress in
the coming years as solar energy used mainly for water heating”
gains momentum, he said.  Prices for the fuel, used in cooking and to heat water,
averaged $1,327 a ton in February, he said. That includes a
premium of $147 charged by the supplier.  Port Louis-based STC imports petroleum products, cement,
wheat flour and rice, according to its website. Mauritius has a
population of about 1.3 million people, according to Statistics
Mauritius.  To contact the reporter on this story:
