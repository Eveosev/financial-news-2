Libya ’s economy minister said the
country’s first trade fair since  Muammar Qaddafi  was ousted and
killed last year will focus on opportunities to rebuild
infrastructure.  Economy Minister Ahmed El-Koshly told reporters late
yesterday the 40th Tripoli International Trade Fair will run
from April 2 to April 24.  Trade fair manager Ahmed Ali Mourad said that about 350
local companies are participating, while international firms
from eight nations have expressed interest. Mourad said the
largest foreign contingent slated to attend was from  France ,
with about 50 companies representing various industries
including construction and housing.  Libya sits atop Africa’s largest proven reserves of crude.
Officials have said much of the infrastructure needs rebuilding,
partly because of the fighting and also from decades of neglect
under Qaddafi’s regime.  To contact the reporter on this story:
