Hong Kong ’s securities regulator
said it is waiving annual licensing fees for two years to lower
regulatory costs for the industry.  The fee waiver will cover all 40,000 intermediaries,
including companies, their representatives and officers that
require licenses from the regulator, from April 1, the
Securities & Futures Commission said in a  statement  posted on
its website today.  “Market conditions have been difficult and the outlook is
unclear,” Chief Executive Officer Ashley Alder said in the
statement. “We hope that this two-year fee waiver will benefit
all securities and futures intermediaries and will encourage
licensed and registered corporations to continue to invest in
their staff, including staff training and other development
activities.”  The fee waiver doesn’t apply to new license applications
and transfers, it added. More details will be provided in a
document later today.  A license is required for activities including dealing in
and advising on securities, futures, corporate finance margin
financing and asset management.  To contact the reporter on this story:
