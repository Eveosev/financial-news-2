Inter Milan  fired coach Claudio Ranieri and appointed youth team coach Andrea Stramaccioni to
take charge of the Italian soccer team’s senior squad.  Stramaccioni, 36, will be presented as Inter’s new coach
today at a press conference at the club’s training facility in
Appiano Gentile, the team said last night on its  website .  The 60-year-old Ranieri, the former manager of Chelsea,
Juventus and Valencia, was hired in September to replace Gian
Piero Gasperini. Inter is eighth in the 20-team standings,
having lost 12 of its 29 league matches this season.  The 2-0 defeat at Juventus two days ago left Inter with
just one win from its the past 10 league games. The club is also
out of  Europe ’s elite  Champions League , having lost to Marseille
in the round of 16.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
