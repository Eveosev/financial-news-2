South Korea , the fastest-growing
producer of  greenhouse gases  among rich nations, may approve a
law on setting up  emissions trading  in 2015 after the April 11
general elections, a top climate policy official said.  “We believe the bill will be passed” as long as lawmakers
schedule a vote after the elections, Young Soo Gil, chairman of
the Presidential Committee on Green Growth, told reporters today
in Seoul.  Lawmakers unexpectedly delayed voting on the bill on Feb.
27, even after  Asia ’s fourth-largest economy agreed to push back
the program’s start by two years to 2015 as the largest
companies said it will hurt competitiveness. The government is
working to reschedule the vote, with a target of April or May,
Nam Kwang Hee, director general of the Presidential Committee on
Green Growth, said March 19.  A multiparty panel of the assembly agreed last month on the
need to create a market to help reduce carbon-dioxide
discharges. The bill has to go to the nation’s Legislation and
Judiciary Committee and then to the assembly’s plenary session,
the last step for the law.  If the session isn’t held by the end of May, pending bills
will expire when the new national assembly is formed in June,
Young told reporters.  “As ruling and opposition parties agreed on the need of
the legislation, the bill is likely to be passed at the
assembly’s plenary session without big changes,” Young said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
