As many as 5 million shares of
 Holcim Ltd. (HOLN)  are being sold in a placing with a price guidance of
59.25 Swiss francs to market each, according to terms of the
sale obtained by Bloomberg News.  The offering has received enough orders to raise about 300
million Swiss francs ($332 million), according to a person with
knowledge of the matter, who declined to be identified because
the sale is private.  To contact the reporters on this story:
