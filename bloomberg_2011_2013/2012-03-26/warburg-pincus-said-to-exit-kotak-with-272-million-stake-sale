Warburg Pincus LLC exited a more
than seven-year-old investment in  Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. (KMB)   The U.S. private equity firm, which first invested in Kotak
in November 2004, sold 26.5 million  shares  in a block trade
today, said Malini Roy, an external spokeswoman for Warburg. Roy
declined to provide details of the sale. The shares represent
about 3.6 percent of the bank, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The holding is valued at $272 million, based on Kotakâ€™s
March 23 closing price. Kotak, founded by billionaire Uday Kotak, gained 26 percent this year in Mumbai trading, in line
with gains for the 14-lender BSE India Bankex Index. The stock
rose 1.1 percent to 531.15 rupees at the 3:30 p.m. close in
Mumbai.  Warburg sold a 3.3 percent stake in Kotak on Feb. 1,
according to an exchange filing. Last month,  Citigroup Inc. (C) 
exited a seven-year investment in  Housing Development Finance
Corp. (HDFC)  through a $1.9 billion stake sale.  Warburg Pincus affiliates have invested $3 billion in
Indian companies in sectors including manufacturing,
infrastructure and technology, Roy said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporters on this story:
