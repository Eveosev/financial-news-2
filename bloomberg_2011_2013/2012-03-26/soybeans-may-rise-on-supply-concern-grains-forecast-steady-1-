What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 10 cents to 12 cents a bushel higher
on the Chicago Board of Trade on speculation that smaller crops
in  South America  will increase demand for U.S. exports as
Chinese buyers look for supplies, Greg Grow, the director of
agribusiness at Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, said
in a telephone interview.  Soybean-oil  futures are expected to
open up 0.3 cent to 0.4 cent a pound, and soybean-meal futures
may open $3 to $4 higher per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that cold, dry weather during the
next two weeks may damage crops in the southern U.S. Great
Plains, Grow said.  -- Corn futures are called to open steady to 2 cents a bushel
lower in  Chicago  on concern that a government report on March 30
will show that demand eased in the three months ended Feb. 29,
and farmers plan to boost acreage to the highest since 1944,
Grow said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
