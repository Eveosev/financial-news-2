Zimbabwe ’s capital, Harare, plans
to borrow $100 million from the Development Bank of  South Africa 
to rehabilitate the city’s water infrastructure, Mayor Muchadeyi Masunda said.  “We are keen to have investors in the area of
infrastructure, we are in talks with Development Bank of South
Africa for funding in the area of especially water
infrastructure rehabilitation,” Masunda said at a conference in
the city today. “The project will cost around $100 million.
It’s not just water infrastructure, but there is also a serious
shortfall of electricity.”  African Development Bank  and an unidentified French lender
would also assist with funding, he said.  DBSA is funding the rehabilitation of the southern African
nation’s roads, David Monaye, a senior policy analyst at the
bank, said in an interview in Harare.  “Last year we committed $206.6 million in the
rehabilitation of roads,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
