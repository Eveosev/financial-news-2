Dyckerhoff AG (DYK)  (DYK), the German cement
maker owned by  Buzzi Unicem SpA (BZU) , forecast that sales and
earnings will rise next year as a return to seasonal weather
holds back growth in 2012.  Revenue and profit this year will probably match figures
for 2011, when an unusually warm winter enabled the company to
make deliveries the entire year, Wiesbaden-based Dyckerhoff said
in its  annual report  published today. Earnings will probably
return to “a positive trend” in 2013, it said.  Volume will probably decline in western  Europe  and parts of
eastern Europe in 2012, the company said. Volume will grow in
Russia and Ukraine this year, Dyckerhoff said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
