     March 26 (Bloomberg) -- Havas SA, the French advertising
company controled by billionaire  Vincent Bollore , rose the most
in about 19 months after saying on March 23 that it would buy
back 12 percent of its shares.  The  shares rose  as much as 9.6 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since September 2009, and traded 8.3 percent
higher at 4.39 euros as of 9:12 a.m. in Paris. The stock was the
biggest gainer on the SBF120 index.  After the close of trading March 23, Havas said it has
filed with the regulators its plan to back the shares at 4.90
euros a share, or a premium of 21 percent over the 4.05 euros
price on that day.  Havas, which is spending 253 million euros ($336 million),
on the exercise, said the buyback will boost its 2011 earnings
per shares by 10.8 percent.  The buyback suggests a largescale acquisition is too
pricey, Nomura Securities said. The buyback comes after Havas on
March 1 announced a  dividend  on 11 euro sents a share.  After the transaction, Bollore’s stake in Havas will rise
to 37.32 percent from 32.84 percent, although the Chairman of
the Bollore holding company will not participate in the buyback,
Havas said.  In a separate statement, local markets regulator AMF said
Bollore was exempt from a requirement to offer to buy all of
Havas shares, contrary to usual procedure when a single
shareholder’s stake climbs above a third of a company’s capital.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
