Goldman Sachs Group Inc. credit
traders Matthew Knopman and Philip Ha are leaving for  hedge
funds  after the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets cut jobs and
pay last year.  Knopman will start at  Anchorage Capital Group LLC  on May 1,
according to three people familiar with the move, who declined
to be identified because it hasn’t been announced. Ha will join
 MKP Capital Management LLC  in  New York , another person said.
Knopman and Ha are among at least four credit traders who have
left the New York-based bank for hedge funds since November. Rob Jackson joined Cyrus Capital Partners LP in February, two people
said, and Tim Reilly departed last month, one person said.  Goldman Sachs cut compensation 21 percent last year as
revenue slid 26 percent, led by a 34 percent drop in revenue
from trading fixed-income, currencies and commodities, the
company reported in January. About 50  Goldman Sachs (GS)  partners,
the most senior rank, left the company in the 12 months through
January.  Bonuses for fixed-income traders across  Wall Street  were
cut by an average of 35 percent to 45 percent, according to  Alan Johnson , president and founder of compensation consulting
company Johnson Associates Inc.  Knopman and Jackson declined to comment and Ha and Reilly
couldn’t be reached. Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for
Anchorage, Konstantin Shishkin, a spokesman for MKP, and Tiffany Galvin, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, said they couldn’t
comment on the moves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
