Deutsche Shipping,  Deutsche Bank
AG (DBK) ’s shipping finance unit, increased its loan commitments in
2011 by 33 percent on higher demand in  Asia .  Loan commitments rose to 1.6 billion euros ($2.1 billion)
from 1.2 billion euros in 2010, it said in an e-mailed statement
today. Loans to clients in Asia more than doubled while the
general market remained “difficult,” it said.  “We are very satisfied with the way the business developed
in 2011, particularly in light of the continuing uncertainty in
the three major shipping markets,” Deutsche Shipping said in
the statement. “The shipping crisis will continue to shape the
market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
