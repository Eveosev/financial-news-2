More than 300 people from small
companies in Guangzhou in southern  China  protested alleged loan
fraud by two guarantee firms, prompting authorities to deploy
more than 100 policemen, Xinhua News Agency reported.  Itâ€™s the third street protest by businesspeople in
 Guangdong province  since police started fraud investigations
into Huading Financing & Guarantee Co. and Guangdong Wealth
Guarantee Co. on March 15, the official news service said.  Protesters want the banking regulator to stop banks from
pressing for repayment of loans insured by the firms, Xinhua
said. The protest ended after representatives from the banks and
regulator agreed to address the issue in 10 days, it said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
