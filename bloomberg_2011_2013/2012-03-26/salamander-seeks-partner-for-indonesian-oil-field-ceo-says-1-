Salamander Energy Plc (SMDR) , a U.K. oil
and gas producer in  Southeast Asia , is seeking an exploration
partner at Indonesia’s North Kutei field as it hunts for
resources to counter a decline in output.  The company plans to drill as many as eight wells in the
North Kutei area starting in the fourth quarter, Chief Executive
Officer James Menzies said today in a telephone interview. It
“would like to bring a partner into the acreage” and is in
“active discussions,” he said, declining to name any parties.  Salamander expects production to fall to as low as 12,000
barrels of oil equivalent a day this year from 18,600 barrels a
day, after selling assets in 2011. Output may rise to about
20,000 barrels a day in 2014 as the company taps  Indonesia ’s
North Kutei and Greater Kerendan regions, and the Greater
Bualuang area in the Gulf of  Thailand .  Production at Bualuang is “very supportive of the
underlying cash flows” as production falls off, Chief Financial
Officer  Jonathan Copus  said today by phone.  The North Kutei field holds 676 million barrels of oil
equivalent resources, London-based Salamander said earlier in a
statement. The area has “very big prospects,” Menzies said,
adding that the company may sell further “non-core” assets in
the north of Sumatra and northeast Thailand.  Capital expenditure will increase by 13 percent to $225
million this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
