Aberdeen Asset Management Plc (ADN) , a
Scottish  fund manager , said funds under management rose 6
percent in the first two months of the year as clients added
money to its equities funds.  Assets climbed to 184.4 billion pounds ($293 billion) as of
Feb. 29 from 173.9 billion pounds at the end of December, the
Aberdeen, Scotland-based firm said in a statement today. Net new
business flows into equities totaled 2.5 billion pounds.  The MSCI World index has climbed 11 percent this year as
Greece completed the biggest debt restructuring in history. The
benchmark tumbled 7 percent last year amid concern policy makers
would fail to prevent  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis from
spreading beyond Greece.  “Since the start of the calendar year, global markets have
extended their gains and have taken on a more settled tone,”
the company said in today’s statement. “Whilst we retain a
degree of caution in our outlook for stock markets, we believe
we remain well placed to continue our progress.”  Aberdeen climbed 4.4 percent to 260.8 pence in  London 
trading today, for a market value of almost 3 billion pounds.
The stock was the second-biggest climber in the U.K.’s benchmark
FTSE 100 Index today.  The company, which manages investments for institutions and
individuals, plans to report half-year results on April 30.  To contact the reporters on this story:
