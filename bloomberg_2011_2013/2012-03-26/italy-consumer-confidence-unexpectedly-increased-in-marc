Italian  consumer confidence 
unexpectedly rose to an eight-month high in March as households
grew upbeat amid Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s bid to overhaul
the euro area’s third-biggest economy.  The confidence index increased to 96.8, the highest since
July of last year, from a revised 94.4 in February, national
statistics office Istat said in Rome today. Economists forecast
a reading of 93.5, according to the median of 12 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Monti’s government approved a labor-market overhaul last
week that expands  unemployment benefits  and seeks to increase
the use of permanent-job contracts. Since taking office in
November, the Cabinet has passed a 20 billion-euro ($26.5
billion) austerity package to eliminate the budget deficit next
year as well as measures aimed at bolstering growth by
deregulating services and cutting bureaucratic red tape.  Italy’s borrowing costs have declined since November as the
 European Central Bank ’s unlimited lending to banks helped boost
demand for sovereign debt. The yield on the nation’s 10-year
benchmark bond was 4.98 percent at 8:45 a.m., compared with a
euro-area high of 7.26 percent on Nov. 25.  Istat originally reported February’s  consumer confidence 
reading at 94.2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
