(Corrects to clarify that the new loan is not part of the
repayment plan.)  DP World Ltd. (DPW) , the world’s third-
biggest port operator, will repay a $3 billion revolving credit
facility next month ahead of its maturity in October, using
existing cash resources.  The Dubai-based company will set up a new $1 billion five-
year revolving credit facility, it said in a  statement  to Nasdaq
Dubai today. “We have no immediate need to draw down the new
facility,” it said.  The existing loan will be repaid between April 4 and 10. It
will reduce DP World’s debt to about $4.7 billion, leaving it
with a cash balance of about $1.2 billion, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
