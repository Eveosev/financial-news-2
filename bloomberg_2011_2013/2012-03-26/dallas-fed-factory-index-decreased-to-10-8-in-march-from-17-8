Manufacturing in  Texas  expanded
less than forecast in March as orders slowed.  The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas said its general
 economic index  decreased to 10.8 this month from 17.8 in
February. Economists forecast the gauge would fall to 17,
according to the median of 10 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey. Readings greater than zero signal expansion.  The outlook over the next six months increased, indicating
manufacturers are still confident in the expansion. Labor-market
gains may help bolster  consumer spending , the biggest part of
the economy, and further propel the industry.  A pair of Fed factory reports on March 15 showed the
industry is helping bolster economic growth. Manufacturing in
the  Philadelphia (OUTFGAF)  area grew at the fastest pace in almost a year,
while factories in the  New York (EMPRGBCI)  region grew the most since June
2010.  The  Dallas  Fed’s production index was little changed at
11.1 in March. The new orders measure dropped to minus 0.3, the
weakest in three months, from 5.8 in February. The gauge of
factory employment dropped to 21.7 from 25.2.  A gauge of manufacturers’ outlooks six months from now rose
to 19.1 from 15.9.  Data for the Dallas Fed’s factory gauge were collected
March 13-21, and 88 manufacturers in Texas responded to the
survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
