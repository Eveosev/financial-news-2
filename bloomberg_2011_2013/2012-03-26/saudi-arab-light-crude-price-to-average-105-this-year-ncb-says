Arab Light crude, which makes up
about 50 percent of  Saudi Arabia ’s oil output, is forecast to
average $105 a barrel this year, according to  National
Commercial Bank , the kingdom’s largest bank by assets.  The lender raised its estimate by $10 from its previous
forecast of $95, NCB said in an e-mailed report today. Arab
Light averaged $107.80 last year, helping Saudi Arabia to report
a record budget surplus, the bank said in December.  Saudi Arabian Oil Co., or Saudi Aramco as the state
producer is known, pumps five grades of crude that range from
Arab Heavy to Arab Super Light, according to the company’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
