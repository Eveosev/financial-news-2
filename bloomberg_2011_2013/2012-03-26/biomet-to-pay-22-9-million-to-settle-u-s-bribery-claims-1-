Biomet Inc., (BMET)  a closely held maker
of medical devices, agreed to pay $22.9 million to settle U.S.
accusations that it bribed foreign doctors to win business, the
government said.  Biomet, based in Warsaw,  Indiana , will pay about
$17.3 million in criminal fines to the U.S. Justice Department
and about $5.6 million to the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the SEC said today in a statement.  The SEC sued Biomet under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
today in federal court in  Washington . The regulator alleged the
company and four of its subsidiaries from 2000 to 2008 paid
bribes to doctors in Argentina, Brazil and  China . The payments
were falsely recorded on the company’s books as “commissions,”
“royalties” and “scientific incentives,” according to the
Justice Department.  Biomet cooperated with the government probes and conducted
its own internal investigation, the company said in an e-mailed
statement.  “Moving forward, we intend to continue to adhere to our
enhanced global compliance procedures, and to promote the
company’s commitment to the highest ethical standards in all the
markets that we serve,” Jeffrey Binder, Biomet’s president and
chief executive officer, said in a statement.  The case is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v.
Biomet Inc., 12-00454, U.S. District Court,  District of Columbia 
(Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
