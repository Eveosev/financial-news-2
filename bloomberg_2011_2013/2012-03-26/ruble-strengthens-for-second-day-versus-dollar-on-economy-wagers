The ruble strengthened to its
strongest level in seven months as optimism the global economic
recovery will continue lifted demand for the currency of the
world’s biggest energy exporter and on speculation exporters are
buying rubles to pay taxes.  The ruble appreciated 1 percent to 28.9925 per dollar at
the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, its best level since Aug. 31. The
country’s 138 billion rubles ($4.7 billion) of domestic OFZ
notes due July 2015 rose, pushing yields down five basis points,
or 0.05 percentage point, to 7.12 percent.  German business confidence unexpectedly climbed to an
eight-month high in March, signaling demand for Russian exports
may rally in  Europe . Russia’s natural-resource companies are due
to pay the government as much as 700 billion rubles ($24
billion) in quarterly taxes, according to Sergey Fishgoyt,
deputy head of foreign exchange at Otkritie Bank in Moscow.  “Locally tax payments have driven overnight interest
higher, and companies are selling dollars for rubles to get
money to pay into the budget,” Sergey Romanchuk, head of
foreign exchange and money markets at OAO AKB Metalinvest Bank
in Moscow, said by e-mail. “Foreign investors also seem to be
adding to ruble positions.”  The overnight  MosPrime rate  banks say they charge to lend
to each other in rubles jumped 52 basis points to 5.8 percent,
the highest level since Jan. 30.  “High  oil prices  are keeping speculators happy in the
ruble carry trade,” Fishgoyt said by e-mail. “There’s no
reasons for a falling ruble at the moment no matter how many
dollars the central bank is buying.”  Interventions  Bank Rossii manages the ruble within a so-called “floating
corridor” against a basket of dollars and euros to limit swings
that erode exporters’ competitiveness. The current level against
the basket implies the bank may be buying about $250 million a
day in other currencies against the ruble, Fishgoyt said.  Urals crude oil , Russia’s chief export, has risen 15
percent to $121.60 per barrel in 2012, heading for the biggest
quarterly advance since March 2011. Oil and gas together provide
about 17 percent of  Russia ’s gross domestic product and 50
percent of state revenue, according to government estimates.  High oil prices will probably mean the ruble continues to
strengthen in the second quarter as investment in the Russian
economy increases following the presidential election on March
4, Artem Gavrilov, head of foreign exchange,  interest rates  and
money markets at Nomos Bank in Moscow, said by e-mail. The
currency may weaken again in the third quarter, he said.  The ruble has gained 11 percent against the dollar in 2012,
heading for the best quarterly rise since Bloomberg began
compiling the data in 2003.  Brazil ’s real appreciated 2.7
percent over the same period,  India ’s rupee strengthened 4
percent and  China ’s yuan lost 0.1 percent, the data show.  Inflows Seen  Russia’s central bank expects capital inflows to begin this
year after a new government is formed, Interfax reported, citing
unidentified investors who met with Bank Rossii Deputy Chairman
Sergey Shvetsov.  The central bank sees Russia ending 2012 with a net private
capital inflow after outflows of an estimated $13.5 billion in
January and $9 billion in February, Interfax reported, citing
Shvetsov’s comments to possible Eurobond investors.  The ruble strengthened 0.9 percent to 38.6025 per euro and
0.9 percent to 33.317 against the central bank’s target dollar-
euro basket. Investors pared bets on the currency weakening,
with non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 29.3695 per
dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 29.6863
per dollar on March 23.  Cost of Protection  The yield on Russia’s $2 billion of Eurobonds due 2015
dropped two basis points to 2.294 percent. 2015 dollar-
denominated notes issued by OAO Sberbank, Russia’s largest
lender, yielded 11 basis points less than on March 23 at 3.628
percent, while the yield on similar-maturity debt from state gas
monopoly OAO Gazprom declined 14 basis points to 3.43 percent.  The cost of protecting Russian debt against non-payment for
five years using credit-default swaps advanced one basis point
to 179 basis points, down from last year’s peak of 338 on Oct.
4, according to data provider CMA, which is owned by CME Group
Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
