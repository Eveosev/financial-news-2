The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
fell less than 0.1 percent to 987.5 at the close of trading in
 Prague , marking a five-day rout, the longest since the period
ended Dec. 12.  The following were among the most active  equities  on the
Prague Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)   of Austria fell 0.8 percent
to 450.5 koruna, its fifth day of declines. Financial companies
were among the worst performers in  Europe  today as concern rose
that Spain’s struggle to control its finances may reignite the
region’s debt crisis.  Kit Digital Inc. (KITD)   increased 6.3 percent, the most
since Jan. 6, to 123.25 koruna. The maker of online video
software rebounded on speculation its 27 percent drop in the
previous session was overdone.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)  , the biggest Czech coking-
coal producer, rose the most in seven weeks. U.S. Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said an accommodative monetary
policy is still needed, spurring global demand for commodities.
