Former Vice President  Dick Cheney 
is ‘awake and talking’ after undergoing heart transplant surgery
on March 24, spokeswoman Kara Ahern said.  “He is doing very well, is awake and talking and even was
able to stand up yesterday,” Ahern said in an e-mail.  Cheney’s doctors are “very pleased” with the pace of his
recovery, Ahern said, and his wife and daughters are with him.  The transplant was done at Inova Fairfax Hospital in  Falls
Church , Virginia, a suburb of Washington.  The 71-year-old vice president under President George W. Bush had been on a heart transplant list for more than 20
months, according to a March 24 statement from Ahern. Two years
ago, Cheney had a left ventricular assist device implanted for
treatment of end-stage heart failure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
