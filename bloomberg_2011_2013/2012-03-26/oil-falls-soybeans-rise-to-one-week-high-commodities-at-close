Singapore time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
fell 0.2 percent to 1,617.7411.  CRUDE OIL  Oil extended two weeks of decline in  New York  on
speculation that fuel demand may falter as Europe struggles to
tame its debt crisis and  China’s economy  slows.  Oil for May delivery slipped as much as 61 cents to $106.26
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $106.48 at 9:08 a.m. London time. It rose
$1.52 to $106.87 on March 23, the highest close since March 21.
Prices are up 7.7 percent so far this year after advancing 25
percent in the last quarter of 2011.  NATURAL GAS  OIL PRODUCTS  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Asian marker Dubai
crude dropped $1.11 to $13.89 a barrel at 11 a.m.  Singapore 
time, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker.
This crack spread, a measure of processing profit, is the
narrowest since Dec. 31, 2010. Gasoil swaps for April were
unchanged for a second day at $136 a barrel, PVM said.  April naphtha swaps increased $8.75, or 0.8 percent, to
$1,064.45 a metric ton, according to PVM. The petrochemical
feedstock is at the highest in three days. Naphtha’s premium to
London-traded Brent crude futures climbed $10.93 to $123.91 a
ton, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack spread
widened for the first day in four.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold may advance for a second day as concern resurfaced
that  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis may worsen even as the
region’s finance ministers prepare a deal to strengthen a
firewall.  Spot gold traded little changed at $1,663.29 an ounce at
2:28 p.m. in Singapore after gaining as much as 0.5 percent to
$1,669.57, the highest level since March 14. Bullion for April
delivery rose as much as 0.4 percent to $1,669.40 an ounce on
the Comex in New York before trading at $1,663.60.  BASE METALS  Copper climbed for a second day on speculation that demand
from China and the U.S., the world’s biggest consumers of
industrial metals, remains robust.  Three-month copper rose as much as 0.7 percent to $8,440 a
metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and traded at $8,400 by
3:11 p.m. in Singapore. The metal lost 1.5 percent last week
after reports showed manufacturing shrank in Europe and  China .
Comex May-delivery metal rose 0.2 percent to $3.8140 a pound.  GRAINS, SOFT COMMODITIES
Soybeans advanced for a second day, rising to the highest level
in one week, as dry weather in  South America  damaged crops and
raised concern supplies may fall short of demand. Corn and wheat
declined.  May-delivery soybeans rose as much as 0.8 percent to
$13.7625 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the highest
price for the most-active contract since March 19, and were at

14 percent this year, heading for a 4.2 percent gain this month.  Corn for May delivery dropped 0.2 percent to $6.45 a
bushel. Wheat declined 0.3 percent to $6.5225 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
