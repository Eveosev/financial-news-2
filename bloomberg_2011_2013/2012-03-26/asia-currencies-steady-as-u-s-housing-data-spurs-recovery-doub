Asian currencies declined, led by
South Korea’s won, as data cast doubt on the strength of the U.S.
economic recovery and regional stocks fell.  Purchases of new homes in the U.S. dropped 1.6 percent to a
313,000 annual pace last month, less than the median estimate of
325,000 in a Bloomberg News survey, a report showed on March 23.
The MSCI Asia-Pacific  Index (MXAP)  of stocks fell for a second day as a
report showed Chinese banks have understated the risks of loans
to local governments. Italy’s Prime Minister Mario Monti warned
that Spain could reignite  Europe ’s debt crisis.  “We saw a risk-off mood in emerging-market currencies
today, with the U.S. housing data boding ill for growth and
therefore Asian exports,” said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-
based strategist at Credit Agricole CIB.  The won weakened 0.6 percent to 1,141.63 per dollar, a two-
month low, at the 3 p.m. close in Seoul, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  India ’s rupee dropped 0.4 percent to
51.3988, while the Philippine peso fell 0.2 percent to 43.065.
 China ’s yuan declined 0.10 percent to 6.3140.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar  Index (ADXY)  dropped 0.2
percent, the biggest decline in almost a week. The gauge’s 60-
day historical  volatility  was at 3.44 percent from 3.50 percent
at the end of last week.  World leaders gather in Seoul today and tomorrow for the
Nuclear Security Summit, aimed at keeping fissile material out
of the hands of terrorists. U.S. President Barack Obama warned
North Korea yesterday that its plan to fire a long-range rocket
undermined prospects for future negotiations. South Korea is
preparing steps to trace or intercept the North’s missile if it
veers off course and reaches the South, Kim Min Seok, a
spokesman at  South Korea ’s defense ministry, said today.  Negative Reports  “The won tested the lower side today as overseas reports
turned a little negative and stocks declined,” said Ryoo Hyun Jung, a Seoul-based chief currency dealer at Citibank Inc. “The
ongoing nuclear summit also affected sentiment.”  The yuan reversed an earlier advance after the People’s
Bank of China set its daily reference rate at a record high amid
speculation policy makers are preparing to widen the currency’s
trading band. The daily fixing was set 0.05 percent stronger at
6.2858 per dollar, the highest since the currency was allowed to
float in 2005.  “There’s a risk-off dynamic in play as global equities are
weak,” said  Robert Minikin , a strategist at Standard Chartered
Plc. in  Hong Kong .  Elsewhere, Taiwan’s dollar fell 0.1 percent to NT$29.622
against its U.S. counterpart. Malaysia’s ringgit weakened 0.1
percent to 3.0800, while Thailand’s baht and Vietnam’s dong were
little changed at 30.78 and 20,895, respectively. Indonesia’s
rupiah advanced 0.1 percent to 9,178.  To contact the reporters on this story:
