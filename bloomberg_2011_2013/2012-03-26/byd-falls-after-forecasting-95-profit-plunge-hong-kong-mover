BYD Co. (1211) , the Chinese carmaker
partly owned by  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , fell
to a two-month low in  Hong Kong  trading after the company
forecast first-quarter profit may slump as much as 95 percent.  BYD fell by as much as 11 percent, the biggest  intraday 
decline since Sept. 26, before closing 4.8 percent lower at
HK$19.94 yuan in Hong Kong. The company’s Shenzhen-traded shares
gained 1.8 percent, reversing a 3.9 percent decline.  First-quarter net income may plunge 65 percent to 95
percent, the company said in statements to Hong Kong’s stock
exchange yesterday. The stock has outpaced gains in the
benchmark Hang Seng Index this year on speculation the company
is recovering from last year, when profit declined 45 percent.  “I doubt this year will be a turnaround year for BYD,”
said Jack Yeung, Hong Kong-based analyst at  BNP Paribas SA. (BNP) 
“There is a lot of competition in the low-end segment of the
market.”  BYD derived 48 percent of 2011 sales from automobiles, with
42 percent from handset components and assembly services and the
rest from rechargeable batteries, according to its annual
report. The company’s net income margin declined to 3 percent
last year, compared with 10 percent in 2009.  The automaker will introduce in June the second generation
of its F3 model, which was China’s best-selling sedan in 2010
and 2009, the company said on Feb. 3. Sales of the F3 declined
after  General Motors Co. (GM)  and  Honda Motor Co. (7267)  released new cars.  “In 2012, the Group expects the automobile market to
rebound during the whole year,”  Wang Chuanfu , BYD chairman,
said in the annual report.  Formed 16 years ago as a battery maker, BYD began
developing electric cars in 2003. It started selling its E6
electric car to individuals in October after testing it as a
taxi in Shenzhen. The automaker is also running trials of its
electric buses in Finland.  MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co. (329802Q) , a unit of Berkshire
Hathaway, bought 9.9 percent of BYD in July 2009 for HK$1.8
billion, or HK$8 apiece. Thirteen of the 22 analysts covering
the stock have a sell rating, while nine have a hold
recommendation.  BYD will this month announce the first brand of electric
vehicles through its joint venture with Daimler AG in  China ,
Wang said today at a briefing in Hong Kong.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
