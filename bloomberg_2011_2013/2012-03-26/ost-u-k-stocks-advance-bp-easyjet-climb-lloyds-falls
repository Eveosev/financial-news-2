U.K. stocks  rose the most in almost
two weeks after a report by the Ifo institute showed that German
business confidence unexpectedly climbed in March.  Aberdeen Asset Management Plc (ADN)  gained 4.4 percent after
funds increased in the first two months of this year. EasyJet
Plc surged 7.5 percent after forecasting a narrower loss for the
six months through the end of March.  ICAP Plc (IAP)  fell 2.1 percent
after HSBC Holdings Plc downgraded the shares.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  advanced 47.81, or 0.8 percent, to
5,902.7 at the close in London, the largest gain since March 13.
The broader FTSE All-Share Index climbed 0.9 percent today,
while Ireland’s ISEQ Index increased 0.4 percent.  “We’re seeing a relatively good start to the week,” said
 Angus Campbell , head of sales at Capital Spreads in London.
“We’ve seen some good Ifo numbers from  Germany , which does rub
off on the U.K. market.”  A report today showed that  Germany’s business confidence 
climbed to an eight-month high in March, signaling that  Europe ’s
largest economy will return to growth.  The Ifo institute’s business climate index, based on a
survey of 7,000 executives, increased to 109.8 this month. That
beat the  median economist forecast  in a Bloomberg News survey
for a reading of 109.6.  The FTSE 100 has  added 5.9 percent  this year as the
 European Central Bank  provided 1 trillion euros ($1.3 trillion)
of loans to the region’s lenders and reports showed that the
U.S. economic recovery is strengthening. The number of shares
changing hands on the index was 19 percent lower than the 30-day
average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. Monetary Policy  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said that while
he’s encouraged by the U.S. jobless rate’s decline to 8.3
percent, continued accommodative  monetary policy  will be needed
to make further progress.  The drop in unemployment may reflect “a reversal of the
unusually large layoffs that occurred” in 2008 and 2009, and
this process may now be over, Bernanke said in a speech today.
Reducing the jobless rate further will probably require a
quicker expansion of business production and consumer demand,
which “can be supported by continued accommodative policies,”
he said.  The U.S.  index  of pending house sales fell 0.5 percent to
96.5 in February after a 2 percent increase a month earlier, the
National Association of Realtors said. The gauge was forecast to
rise 1 percent, according to the median estimate of economists
in a Bloomberg survey.  Aberdeen, EasyJet Advance  Aberdeen Asset Management climbed 4.4 percent to 260.80
pence, the largest increase since Feb. 1. Funds under management
increased 6 percent to 184.4 billion pounds ($293 billion) at
the end of February from 173.9 billion pounds at the end of
December, as clients added money to its equity funds.  EasyJet (EZJ)  jumped 7.5 percent to 495.80 pence, its largest
rally in two months, after predicting a narrower six-month loss
as business bookings helped offset rising fuel costs.  Europe’s second-biggest discount carrier  forecast a pretax
loss in the six months through March 31 of 100 million pounds to
120 million pounds, compared with a loss of 153 million pounds
in the same period last year. EasyJet had predicted a loss of
140 million pounds to 160 million pounds.  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  advanced 6.6 percent to 1,570 pence after
reporting Kenya’s first oil discovery that has been described as
a “major breakthrough” by the country’s president.  Diageo Plc (DGE)  gained 2 percent to 1,539.5 pence after ING
Groep NV increased its share-price estimate to 1,520 pence from
1,329 pence.  Ophir Energy Plc surged 19 percent to 477.6 pence after the
company said its Jodari-1 well in Tanzania found gas, in the
“largest discovery” in Ophir’s history.  ICAP lost 2.1 percent to 408.9 pence after HSBC downgraded
the world’s largest broker of transactions between banks to
underweight, the equivalent of sell, from neutral.  To contact the reporter on this story:
