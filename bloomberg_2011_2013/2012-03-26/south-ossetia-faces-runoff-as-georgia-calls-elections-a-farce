The breakaway Georgian region of
 South Ossetia  will hold a runoff after no candidate received the
50 percent of votes needed to win yesterday’s presidential
election, which  Georgia  called a “farce.”  The former local head of the KGB security service, Leonid
Tibilov, got 42.5 percent while David Sanakoyev garnered 24.6
percent after all votes had been counted in the capital,
Tskhinvali, Rustavi-2 television reported today. A second round
of voting will take place on April 8.  Russia routed Georgia’s army in a five-day war in August
2008 over South Ossetia, later recognizing its independence as
well as that of Abkhazia, another separatist region. Georgia
broke off diplomatic ties with Russia that year. A disputed
presidential ballot in South Ossetia was annulled by a court in
November after victory for opposition candidate Alla Dzhioyeva,
who the Pirweli news agency said boycotted this vote.  South Ossetia “staged a farce,” Georgia’s Deputy Foreign
Minister Nino Kalandadze told reporters today in the Black Sea
nation’s capital, Tbilisi. “No one will recognize these
elections, no matter who wins.”  Only  Russia , Nicaragua, Venezuela, Tuvalu and Nauru
recognize the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which
Georgia maintains Russia occupied after the 2008 conflict.
Abkhazia will hold a second round of voting after a March 10
ballot to elect its 35-member Parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
