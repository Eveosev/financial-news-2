The zloty gained the most in more
than a week after Polish retail sales growth in February almost
matched a 10-month high and business confidence in  Germany ,
country’s biggest trading partner, unexpectedly improved.  The zloty appreciated 0.6 percent to 4.1252 per euro as of
4:54 p.m. in Warsaw, the steepest advance since March 15. The
 WIG20 Index (WIG20)  of stocks gained 0.8 percent to 2,302.7 as copper
miner  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  rose.  Retail sales  grew 13.7 percent from a year earlier, the
statistics office said today, beating a 9.9 percent median
forecast of 21 economists surveyed by Bloomberg in a sign the
European Union’s biggest eastern economy will weather a euro-
region slowdown.  Business confidence  in Germany increased to
109.8 in March, the Munich-based Ifo institute said, beating the
median forecast of 109.6 in a Bloomberg survey.  “The data confirm that the Polish economy got off to a
good start this year,”  Grzegorz Maliszewski  and Urszula
Krynska, economists at Bank Millennium SA in Warsaw, wrote in a
note to clients. “The slowdown may not be as big as feared only
a few months ago.”  Poland remains on track for the European Union’s fastest
growth of 2.5 percent this year, according to forecasts from the
European Commission. It expanded 4.3 percent in 2011 for the
quickest pace in three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
