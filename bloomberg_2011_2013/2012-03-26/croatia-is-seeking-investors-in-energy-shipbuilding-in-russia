Croatia  is looking for investors in
the energy and shipbuilding industries in  Russia , Deputy Prime
Minister Radimir Cacic told  state TV  last night.  Cacic said he will meet in Moscow this week with
representatives of Russian energy companies  Lukoil OAO (LKOH) ,  Gazprom
OAO (GAZP) , and Zarubezhneft OAO, and shipbuilding officials.  “We are open to a huge privatization story,” Cacic said
in the TV interview. The government is also interested in
selling Petrokemija d.d., Croatia’s biggest manufacturer of
fertilizers and clay-based products, he said.  Croatia’s government last week said it will seek solutions
to save money-losing shipyards in the Adriatic ports of Rijeka
and Trogir, following an unsuccessful tender for the state-owned
facilities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
