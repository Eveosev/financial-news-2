EFG-Hermes Holding SAE (HRHO)  said it’s in
talks with Qatar’s  QInvest LLC  to form an investment bank that
would cover the  Middle East , Africa, Turkey, southern  Asia  and
southeast Asia.  The partnership would include securities broking and asset
management, as well as investment banking, EFG-Hermes said in a
Regulatory News Service filing today. QInvest, a unit of  Qatar
Islamic Bank (QIB) , already operates in the target markets.  If an agreement is reached, the new firm will seek to
“play a vital role in the flow of foreign capital” into the
region and enable Arab investors to participate in investment
opportunities, EFG-Hermes said in the statement. Its private-
equity business is excluded from the negotiations.  Shares of EFG-Hermes , the biggest publicly traded Arab
investment bank, fell 0.7 percent to 12.7 Egyptian pounds at
11:01 a.m. in Cairo, paring their increase this year to 27
percent. Shares of  Qatar Islamic Bank (QIB)  retreated 0.1 percent to
77 Qatari rials, bringing their decline in the same period to
8.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
