Google Inc. (GOOG)  was ordered by the
Tokyo District Court to delete terms from its autocomplete
search feature after a man alleged that it violated his privacy,
according to a Kyodo News story published on the Japan Times
website.  Google rejected the order, saying that its U.S.
headquarters isn’t regulated by Japanese law, according to the
 report , which cites the man’s lawyer, Hiroyuki Tomita.  The  Mountain View , California-based company, owner of the
world’s most popular search engine, is reviewing the order,
according to an e-mailed statement from Google to Bloomberg
News.  “A Japanese court issued a provisional order requesting
Google to delete specific terms from autocomplete,” the company
said. “The judge did not require Google to completely suspend
the autocomplete function.”  Autocomplete predicts searches for users as they start
typing queries, in part by using the popularity of search terms,
the company said. Google said it doesn’t determine these terms
manually -- suggested queries are drawn from items that have
been typed in by other Google users.  Kyodo News  initially reported that the Tokyo District Court
ordered Google to “suspend” its autocomplete search function.
It later revised the story to say Google was ordered to delete
terms.  To contact the reporters on this story:
