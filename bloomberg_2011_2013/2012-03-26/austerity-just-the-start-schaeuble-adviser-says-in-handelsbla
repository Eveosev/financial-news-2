The end of the sovereign debt
crisis won’t be in sight before countries have completed
economic adjustment and begin to grow again, Clemens Fuest, an

a guest commentary in  Handelsblatt .  “The crisis-states in  Europe  are rather at the beginning
than at the end of an historically unique austerity process,”
Fuest wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
