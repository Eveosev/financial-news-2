Mold-Masters Group, the Canadian
maker of temperature-control systems, is seeking to extend the
maturity on its $206 million  term loan  to October 2016 from
October 2014, according to a person with knowledge of the
transaction.  The debt will pay interest at 4.5 percentage points more
than the London interbank offered rate, said the person, who
declined to be identified because the terms are private.  Lenders are being offered a 15 basis-point fee to agree to
the extension and a 10 basis-point consent fee, the person said.
A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The Georgetown, Ontario-based company is also seeking to
extend its $31 million revolving line of credit to April 2016
from October 2013, the person said.  Societe Generale SA is arranging the financing and
investors have until March 30 to submit commitments.  Mold-Masters’s existing term loan pays interest at 3.5
percentage points more than Libor, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  3i Group Plc (III) , the London-based private-equity firm, made an
investment in Mold-Masters in August 2007, Bloomberg data shows.  Stephen Farrell, chief financial officer of Mold-Masters,
didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
