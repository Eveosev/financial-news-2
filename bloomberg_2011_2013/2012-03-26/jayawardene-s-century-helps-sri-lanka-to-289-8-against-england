Captain Mahela Jayawardene’s 168
not out steadied  Sri Lanka  after the fall of three early wickets
and pushed the hosts to 289-8 against England in the initial day
of their first cricket Test in Galle.  Jayawardene faced 290 balls and was dropped four times --
including twice by Monty Panesar within several overs in the
afternoon -- while hitting his 30th Test century to rescue his
team. Sri Lanka started 15-3 as Lahiru Thirimanne,  Tillakaratne
Dilshan  and Kumar Sangakkara fell early.  “I’m quite happy with the effort today,” Jayawardene said
in a televised interview. “The first session I had to dig deep
because we lost wickets, but that gave me the mindframe to hang
around and not play my shots. When we started to lose wickets, I
could change my attack.”  Sri Lanka won the toss and elected to bat. Jayawardene and
Chanaka Welgedara, on 10, were batting at the end of the day.  James Anderson , 3-56 and Samit Patel, 2-27, led the English
attack. Panesar and fellow spinner  Graeme Swann  failed to take
wickets.  The teams are meeting in two Tests in the current tour,
with the second match starting April 3 in Colombo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
