China Minsheng Banking Corp. (1988) , the
nation’s first non-state lender, is seeking as much as HK$11.3
billion ($1.46 billion) in a Hong Kong share sale to shore up
capital amid tightened rules for risk buffers.  The Beijing-based bank is offering 1.65 billion shares at
HK$6.65 to HK$6.86 apiece, according to terms for the deal
obtained by Bloomberg News. That represents a discount of as
much as 7 percent to the March 23 closing price of HK$7.15.  Minsheng joins local rivals  Bank of Communications Co.  and
 Industrial Bank Co. (1398)  in seeking funds after a two-year, $2.7
trillion  lending spree  sapped their finances. China’s banking
regulator is planning tougher  capital requirements  for lenders
to fend off rising credit risks.  “The fundraising will ease Minsheng’s capital shortage
only for a short while,” said Sun Peng, a Beijing-based analyst
at BOC International Ltd. “With the new capital requirement to
take effect in July, another round of equity sales by Chinese
banks is just around the corner.”  The  China  Banking Regulatory Commission said in August that
it would require the country’s largest, or so-called
systemically important, lenders to have a minimum capital
adequacy ratio of 11.5 percent by the end of next year. Smaller
banks would be required to have at least 10.5 percent under
“normal conditions” by the end of 2016, the CBRC had said.  Reasonable Price  Minsheng’s  capital adequacy ratio  stood at 10.86 percent as
of Dec. 31, while the core ratio was 7.87 percent. Both are the
lowest among the nine publicly-traded Chinese lenders listed in
Hong Kong.  In February 2011, Minsheng said it planned to issue as much
as 20 billion yuan ($3.17 billion) of convertible bonds in
 Shanghai  and sell as many as 1.65 billion new H-shares in  Hong
Kong  to replenish the core capital of company.  “The  price range  is reasonable,” said Stanley Li, a Hong
Kong-based analyst at Mirae Asset Securities (HK) Ltd.
“Minsheng Bank has a differentiated business. Given it’s a non-
state-owned lender, its corporate governance is also better than
peers. We are positive on Minsheng.”  Minsheng currently trades at 5.3 times its forecast profit
in 2012, the cheapest among Hong Kong-listed peers.  The lender, which has about 590 outlets nationwide, was
founded in 1996 by pig-feed tycoon Liu Yonghao and some of
China’s wealthiest businessmen. The bank has boosted profit by
an average 50 percent since 2007 by focusing on smaller
enterprises. Profit surged 59 percent to 27.9 billion yuan last
year on higher income from lending and fee-based services.  Rival Share Sales  China’s publicly-traded lenders have raised about $87
billion from equity markets since 2010 as an explosion in credit
to local governments and property developers to support the
government’s 4 trillion-yuan stimulus package sapped their
financial strength.  Shanghai-based Bank of Communications said on March 15 it
plans to raise 56.6 billion yuan in the world’s biggest share
sale since May. Industrial Bank, a Chinese lender part-owned by
Hang Seng Bank Co., said earlier this month it will raise as
much as 26.4 billion yuan in a private placement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
