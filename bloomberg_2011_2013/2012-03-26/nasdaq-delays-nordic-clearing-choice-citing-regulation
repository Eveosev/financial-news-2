Nasdaq  OMX Group Inc., which runs
seven Nordic and Baltic exchanges, said it will delay giving
customers a choice of clearinghouse to process their trades,
citing regulatory uncertainty.  Nasdaq had previously said it will offer “competitive
clearing” in the Nordic equity markets by April 2012. The New
York-based exchange didn’t give a new date in a statement today.  Alternative trading systems have pushed so-called
interoperability, which offers traders a choice of who processes
their transactions, trimming the cost of post-trade services.
Clearinghouses including Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.’s
EuroCCP, LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd., the European Multilateral
Clearing Facility NV, in which Nasdaq owns a stake, and SIX x-
clear Ltd. compete for clearing in  Europe .  “There is still uncertainty regarding the detailed
requirements for interoperability even though there is a
political agreement” regarding the European Market
Infrastructure Regulation, Hans-Ole Jochumsen, president of
Nasdaq OMX Nordic, said in the statement. “There needs to be
clarity and a level playing field in this area before we can
introduce interoperability.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
