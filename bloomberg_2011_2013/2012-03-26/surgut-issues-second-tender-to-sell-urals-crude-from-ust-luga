OAO Surgutneftegas (SGTPY) , Russia’s
fourth-largest oil producer, issued a tender to sell Urals crude
from the Baltic Sea terminal at Ust Luga for loading from April
4 to April 5, said three traders who participate in the market.  The tender for 100,000 metric tons will be awarded later
today, according to the people, who declined to be identified
because they aren’t authorized to speak on the matter.  Surgutneftegas awarded a tender for 100,000 tons loading on
March 21 to March 22 from the same terminal to Gunvor Group
Ltd., the first shipment from the port, they said.  Oil loadings from Ust Luga, the receiving point of
Transneft’s 100 billion-ruble ($3.3 billion) Baltic Pipeline
System-2, started on March 23 after a delay since November
because of engineering difficulties, the government said in a
statement.  The port will work on a “test mode,” the government said.
The first tanker loaded with crude from the pipeline will head
for Rotterdam and loading of the next vessel is scheduled for
March 26, according to the statement.  The BPS-2 link will have a capacity of 30 million tons a
year, or 600,000 barrels a day, and is expected to pump 10
million to 15 million tons of crude this year, Igor Dyomin, a
spokesman for  Russia ’s pipeline operator OAO Transneft in
Moscow, said Feb. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
