JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the largest
U.S. bank, is working to restore full service to its 17.3
million online users after a weekend upgrade caused problems
with its consumer website.  “Customers have not been able to access Chase.com at times
today because of some systems changes we made over the
weekend,” said  Kristin Lemkau , a spokeswoman for the New York-
based company. “We are working to restore access as quickly as
possible.”  JPMorgan refunded late fees and waived other charges after
its consumer website failed multiple times over several days in
late 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
