CaixaBank (CABK)  SA,  Spain ’s fourth-
biggest lender, agreed to buy  Banca Civica SA (BCIV) , a group of former
savings banks, for 977 million euros ($1.3 billion) as an
overhaul of the nation’s financial industry gathers pace.  CaixaBank’s all-stock offer values Civica at 1.97 euros a
share, or 0.35 times book value, the buyer said in a statement
late yesterday. The transaction, in which Civica investors get
five CaixaBank shares for every eight of their bank’s shares, is
priced 11 percent below its March 23 closing price.  Civica dropped 11 percent to 1.97 euros by 9:36 a.m. in
Madrid trading, after both stocks were suspended yesterday.
CaixaBank advanced 0.6 percent to 3.16 euros, after jumping as
much as 3.3 percent at the open.  Adding Civica’s 72 billion euros of assets will create a
lender with 342 billion euros in assets and 179 billion euros of
deposits, CaixaBank said, giving it the biggest banking business
in Spain. Chairman Isidro Faine said Jan. 27 he expected a
“wave of mergers” as the government pressures lenders into
deals by making them recognize losses on real estate that piled
up on their books during Spain’s property crash.  Difficult Climate  “The operation creates value for shareholders of both
banks, generating a bank with solid growth potential and a
stronger future for CaixaBank amid a particularly difficult
market climate,” Faine said in an e-mailed statement.  CaixaBank holds a webcast for investors at 10 a.m. in
 Madrid .  The share valuation for Civica in the transaction is 27
percent lower than the 2.70 euro-per-share price of its initial
public offering in July, in which it raised 600 million euros.
CaixaBank has a market value of 12.1 billion euros.  No Government Money  The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter
and will generate cost savings and other benefits of 540 million
euros by 2014, CaixaBank said, adding the deal can be completed
without government money. CaixaBank will make a “value
adjustment” for Civica assets of 3.4 billion euros that will be
charged against reserves, meaning there will be no impact on
earnings, the lender said.  Under the terms of the offer, the combined bank will have a
pro-forma  Basel II  core capital ratio based on December numbers
of 10.4 percent, CaixaBank said in an e-mailed statement.  The transaction won’t prevent CaixaBank from meeting the
 European Banking Authority’s  9 percent core capital ratio
requirement by June this year, the bank said. The ratio of bad
loans to total lending at the combined bank will be 5.5 percent.  CaixaBank said it intends to maintain its dividend at 0.231
euros per share in 2012.  La Caixa , CaixaBank’s parent, will
maintain control of the bank with a 61 percent stake, it said.  The government’s new rules, pushing banks to make bigger
provisions for real estate losses, aim to encourage mergers and
help the industry cut scale and costs. Civica, a lender formed
from the combination of four savings banks in regions including
Navarra, Andalusia and the  Canary Islands , has to make gross
provisions of about 1.25 billion euros because of the order,
compared with pre-provision profit last year of 274 million
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
