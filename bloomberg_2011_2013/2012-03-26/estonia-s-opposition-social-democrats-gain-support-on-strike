Estonia’s opposition Social
Democrats gained record public support in an opinion survey this
month to surpass the ruling Reform Party after the widest
industrial action in two decades.  The Social Democrats were backed by 30 percent of 818
respondents, compared with 22 percent last month, according to a
poll by TNS Emor e-mailed today by the  Baltic News Service ,
which commissioned it. The survey was held Feb. 29 to March 21
and it gave no margin of error.  The Reform Party of Prime Minister  Andrus Ansip  received
the backing of 29 percent, one percentage point higher than in
February, while support for the junior coalition partner Isamaa
ja Res Publica Liit declined to 12 percent, the lowest in at
least 25 months.  “The rise of the Social Democrats is most likely a
consequence of the strikes and protests in the beginning of
March which boosted overall support for opposition parties,”
Aivar Voog, a TNS Emor researcher, said in a comment.  The combined support of the Social Democrats, led by the
former Defense Minister Sven Mikser, and the other opposition
group, the Center Party, rose 5 percentage points to 53 percent,
and exceeded support for government parties for the third month,
Voog said.  Estonia endured its biggest industrial action since
regaining independence in 1991 earlier this month, when blue-
collar workers supported a three-day nationwide strike by
teachers over wages. Next parliamentary elections are due in
March 2015, while municipal councils will be elected next
October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
