Spanish residential mortgages  fell
for the 21st month in January as the euro area’s fourth-largest
economy edged toward a recession and banks reined in lending
amid a surge in bad loans.  The number of home loans fell 41.3 percent from a year
earlier, after a 37.2 percent drop in December, the Madrid-based
National Statistics Institute said in an e-mailed statement
today. The total amount lent fell 34 percent, it said.  A 23 percent unemployment rate has curbed appetite for
loans as Spain’s economy relapsed into a slump stemming from the
2008 collapse of a property boom. Indicators suggest Spain will
enter its second  recession  in two years in this quarter, Deputy
Economy Minister Fernando Jimenez Latorre said on Feb. 16.  Lending fell 3.1 percent in January from a year ago as bad
loans jumped to their highest level since 1994, at 7.91 percent,
the Bank of  Spain  said on March 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
