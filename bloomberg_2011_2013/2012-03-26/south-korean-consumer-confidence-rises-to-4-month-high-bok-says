South Korean  consumer confidence 
rose to the highest level in four months, buoyed by signs of
improvement in the  U.S. economy  and progress in containing
Europe’s sovereign debt crisis.  The  sentiment index  rose to 101 in March from February’s
100, the Bank of Korea said in an e-mailed statement today. A
reading above 100 indicates optimists outnumber pessimists.  The expected inflation rate over the next year was 3.9
percent, slower than the previous month’s estimate of 4 percent,
today’s report showed.  The consumer confidence index is based on a survey of 2,084
households in 56 cities, conducted by mail and telephone between
March 13 and March 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
