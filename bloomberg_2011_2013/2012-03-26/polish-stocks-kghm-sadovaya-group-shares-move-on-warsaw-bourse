Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  rose 0.9
percent to 2,305.12 at the close in Warsaw, climbing for a
second day.  The following were among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , Poland’s sole copper
producer, gained for the first time in eight days, increasing
2.5 percent to 146.6 zloty. Copper futures jumped the most in
four weeks as the dollar’s slump bolstered the prospects for
commodity demand.  Sadovaya Group SA (SGR)  (SGR PW) fell 5.5 percent to 6.33 zloty,
closing at the lowest level since it started trading on the
Warsaw Stock Exchange on December 2010, as the Ukrainian coal
producer said profit will decrease this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
