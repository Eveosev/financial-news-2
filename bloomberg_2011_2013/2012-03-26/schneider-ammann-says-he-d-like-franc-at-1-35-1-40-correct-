(Corrects to say franc should weaken in first paragraph.)   Swiss Economy Minister Johann
Schneider-Ammann said he would “generally like” the franc to
weaken toward 1.35 or 1.40 versus the euro, according to an
interview with Swiss television.  “It would be fatal if the minimum  exchange rate  was
suddenly removed,” Schneider-Ammann said, according to comments
posted on Swiss television’s website today. He referred to the
Swiss central bank’s franc cap of 1.20 versus the euro. Asked
whether the ceiling should be raised, he said while the central
bank is “independent,” the purchasing power parity “is
higher” than 1.20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
