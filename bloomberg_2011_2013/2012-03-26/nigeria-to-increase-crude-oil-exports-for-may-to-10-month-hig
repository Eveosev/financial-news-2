Nigeria ,  Africa â€™s largest oil
producer, plans to boost crude exports in May to a 10-month
high, according to loading plans obtained by Bloomberg News.  A total of 75 cargoes of 18 main grades will be exported in
May, amounting to 69.3 million barrels or 2.24 million barrels a
day, the most since July, the schedules show. That compares with
78 cargoes totaling 2.22 million barrels a day for April.  Nigeria will export five 950,000-barrel cargoes of the new
Usan grade in May, up from three for next month, according to a
plan. Production at the field, which has the capacity to pump
180,000 barrels a day, started in late February, according to
 Total SA (FP) , the operator of the project.  The nation will also ship 12 cargoes of Qua Iboe, eight
Agbami, seven Forcados, five  Bonny Light , five Akpo, five Bonga,
four Erha, four Brass River, four Escravos, three Amenam, three
Yoho, two EA, two Antan, two Okwori, two Okono, one Pennington
and one Abo, the schedules show. Shipments are typically of
950,000 to 1 million barrels each.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
