Gulf Cooperation Council countries,
which includes six Arab states bordering the  Persian Gulf , will
slow their accumulation of foreign assets this year, George
Abed, the Institute of International Financeâ€™s director for
Africa and the  Middle East  said.  Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab
Emirates and Oman will together hold $2.02 trillion in foreign
assets at the end of 2012, up 12 percent from 2011, George Abed
said in a presentation at a conference in Doha, Qatar, today.
Total foreign assets grew 14 percent between 2010 and 2011,
