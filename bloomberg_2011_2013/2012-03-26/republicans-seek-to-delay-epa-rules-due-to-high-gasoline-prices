A U.S. House subcommittee will
 consider  legislation this week that would force the
Environmental Protection Agency to delay new regulations because
of high gasoline prices.  The panel of the House Energy and Commerce Committee will
debate legislation on March 28 that would require further study
of possible EPA rules to cut sulfur from gasoline, curb
pollution from refineries and require renewable fuels to be
mixed into the gasoline supply. The rules would be put on hold
until after the study is completed.  A separate bill would require that the Energy secretary
develop a plan to open more federal lands for oil and gas
drilling if the administration decides to release crude from the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  Gasoline futures have gained 26 percent this year as
mounting tension with  Iran  pushed oil higher and refinery
shutdowns triggered concern that stockpiles may be curtailed
during the peak U.S. driving season. Gasoline prices at the pump
have gained 18 percent this year to $3.897 a gallon yesterday,
according to AAA  data .  The rising cost of gasoline threatens to slow the U.S.
recovery and is emerging as an issue in the 2012 presidential
campaign.  Environmental groups said the EPA proposals arenâ€™t having
any effect on the current rise in pump prices. EPA Administrator
 Lisa Jackson  pledged last week to consider a request from the
state of  Pennsylvania  that the EPA waive summer-gasoline
standards in the Pittsburgh area because of refining shortages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
