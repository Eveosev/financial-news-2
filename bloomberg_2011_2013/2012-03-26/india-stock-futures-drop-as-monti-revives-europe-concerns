Indian stocks dropped the most in
Asia, extending the longest weekly losing stretch since August,
amid concern the government will find it difficult to rein in
the fiscal deficit, and as the rupee weakened to a 10-week low.  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) , the country’s biggest
software exporter, which gets more than 90 percent of its sales
from abroad, fell 2 percent.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , owner of
the world’s largest refining complex, lost 1.9 percent.  ICICI
Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the second-biggest lender, tumbled 4.2 percent.  The BSE  India   Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, sank 1.8 percent
to 17,052.78 at the close, the lowest level in two months. The
government needs to take tough decisions in coming months and
raise additional funds to fill a budget gap, Finance Minister
 Pranab Mukherjee  said over the weekend. The monetary authority
on March 15 indicated that measures to pare the deficit would
boost its scope to cut  interest rates , while flagging inflation
risks from  oil prices  and a weaker rupee.  “A depreciating rupee will lead to higher inflation as we
are a net importer, and higher inflation leads to a slowdown in
the economy that makes managing the deficit very challenging,”
Arun Khurana, a fund manager at UTI Asset Management Co., which
has $11.3 billion in assets, said by phone from Mumbai. “These
imbalances would keep interest rates in a higher trajectory. The
likelihood of a rate cut looks remote, or it may be academic in
nature, or 50 basis points for the whole year.”  Foreign funds have  bought  a net $9.1 billion of local
shares this year, fueling the 10 percent advance in the Sensex,
amid optimism slowing inflation will spur the central bank to
ease monetary policy. The flows have come even as growth in
 Asia ’s third-largest economy moderated to 6.1 percent last
quarter from a year earlier, the slowest pace in almost three
years, as costlier credit hurt consumer spending and dented
investment.  Dollar Purchases  The rupee fell as low as 51.4950 per dollar, the lowest
level since Jan. 16, amid renewed concerns about  Europe ’s debt
crisis and on speculation local importers will step up dollar
purchases to meet payments before the March 31 fiscal year-end.
The currency slid for a fifth day after Italian Prime Minister
 Mario Monti  warned over the weekend that Spain could reignite
Europe’s debt crisis, sapping demand for emerging-market assets.
Europe is India’s third-largest trading partner, taking in a
fifth of the nation’s merchandise exports.  The Sensex trades at 15 times future earnings, compared
with 10.7 times on the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. Thirty-day
 volatility  in the stock gauge was at 20.63 today, the highest in
two months. India VIX, which measures the cost of protection
against declines in the S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index Nifty, jumped 15
percent to 26.74. The Nifty dropped 1.8 percent to 5,184.25 and
its April futures settled at 5,235.40.  Nifty Support  “The key breakout area for the Nifty was just above the
5,200 area,” Laurence Balanco, a technical analyst with CLSA
Asia-Pacific Market, told Bloomberg UTV today. “We have seen
the pullback from 5,700 to this 5,200. It is important that the
market holds the 5,200 support. If it fails to hold that area it
puts the Nifty back into a range between 4,700 and 5,200.”  The  BSE 200 Index (BSE200)  shed 1.8 percent. A total 904 million
shares changed hands on the BSE and NSE on March 23, equivalent
to the daily average in the past 12 months, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Tata Consultancy declined 2 percent to 1,161.6 rupees.
 Infosys Ltd. (INFO)  declined 1.5 percent to 2,830.75 rupees.  Reliance lost 1.9 percent to 730.1 rupees. ICICI sank 4.2
percent to 872.5 rupees.  State Bank of India , the country’s
biggest lender, decreased 2.3 percent to 2,117.45 rupees.  Overseas  funds  bought a net  3.3 billion rupees  ($64.9
million) of Indian stocks on March 22 and March 23, raising
their investment in the equities this year to 450.2 billion
rupees, according to the nation’s market regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
