Colombia , the second-largest
producer of Arabica coffee beans, may produce a smaller crop
than last year because of heavy rainfall.  The harvest may be 7.5 million to 7.8 million bags of 60
kilograms (132 pounds) bags of beans this calendar year, said
Andres Valencia, marketing chief at Colombia’s National
Federation of Coffee Growers. In 2011, the harvest fell 12
percent to 7.81 million bags, the lowest level since 1976.  “The crop is very similar to that of last year,” Valencia
said in a phone interview in Bogota today. “The first-half
harvest isn’t going to be so good.”  Rainfall last year damaged flowering and increased crop
diseases in Colombia, where the harvest has failed to recover
since wet weather reduced output by 32 percent in 2009.
Colombia’s production shrank in February to 571,000 bags from
764,000 bags a year earlier.  Arabica-coffee futures for May delivery rose less than 0.1
percent to close at $1.788 a pound in  New York . Prices have
slumped 33 percent in 12 months.  Brazil  is the largest producer of Arabica beans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
