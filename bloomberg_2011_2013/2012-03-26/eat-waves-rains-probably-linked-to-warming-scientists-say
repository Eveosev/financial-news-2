Heat waves and extreme rainfall in
the past decade are probably linked to global warming, according
to a study by scientists at the Potsdam Institute for Climate
Impact Research.  “For some types of extreme, notably heat waves but also
precipitation extremes, there is now strong evidence linking
specific events or an increase in their number to the human
influence on climate,” the scientists wrote in a  study 
published in the journal Nature Climate Change.  The past decade included  Europe ’s hottest summer in at
least 500 years in 2003, according to the scientists. 2010
brought western Russia’s hottest summer in centuries and record
rain in Pakistan and  Australia , they wrote.  Japan  and some U.S.
states registered all-time-high rainfall last year, while the
Yangtze River basin in  China  had a record drought.  Basic physics exercises suggest that warming of the
atmosphere leads to more extremes, according to the institute.
For example, warm air can hold more moisture that may fall as
rain, the scientists wrote. Computer simulations confirm the
relation between warming and record temperatures and rainfall,
the study showed.  The recent high incidence of weather records is “no longer
normal,” according to Dim Coumou, the lead author of the  study .  To contact the reporter on this story:
