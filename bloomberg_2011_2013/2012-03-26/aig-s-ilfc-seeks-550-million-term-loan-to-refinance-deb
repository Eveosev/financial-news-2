International Lease Finance Corp. (AIG) ,
the aircraft lessor owned by American International Group Inc.,
is seeking a four-year $550 million senior secured  term loan .  Proceeds from the debt will be used to refinance the
company’s outstanding $550 million term loan, Los Angeles-based
ILFC said today in a statement distributed by  Business Wire .  Lenders on the new term loan are being offered one-year
soft-call protection of 101 cents, meaning the company would
have to pay 1 cent more than face value to refinance the debt
during the first year, according to a person familiar with the
transaction.  Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. are arranging the financing and will host a lender
call tomorrow at 11 a.m. in  New York , the person said, who
declined to be identified because the terms are private.  ILFC’s existing term loan due in March 2016 pays interest
at 5 percentage points more than the London interbank offered
rate with a 2 percent minimum on the benchmark, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The debt was sold to investors at 98
cents on the dollar, the data show.  Paul Thibeau, a spokesman for ILFC, declined to comment
beyond the statement.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan it can’t. Libor, the rate at
which banks say they can borrow in dollars from each other,
serves as a reference for about $360 trillion of financial
instruments worldwide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
