Russia’s environmental regulator
said it hasn’t withdrawn licenses belonging to OAO  Mechel (MTLR) ’s
South Kuzbass unit, according to a  statement  on its website.  “We consider inappropriate the dissemination of false
information with reference to an unnamed source at Rosnedra,”
according to the statement from Rosnedra, a regional unit of the
Federal Subsoil Resource Agency. The incorrect information led
to a drop in the company’s market capitalization, the statement
shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
