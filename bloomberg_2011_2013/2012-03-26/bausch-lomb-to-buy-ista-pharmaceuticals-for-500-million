Ista Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ISTA) , the
maker of eye medications, rose 7.9 percent after agreeing to be
bought by  Bausch & Lomb Inc. (BOL)  for $500 million.  Ista climbed to $9.04 at the close of trading in  New York .
 Bausch (BOL)  will pay $9.10 a share in cash for the Irvine,
California-based company, 8.6 percent more than the closing
price yesterday.  Ista, which sells Istalol for intraocular pressure and
Bromday for issues associated with cataract extraction, earlier
this year rebuffed a $327 million hostile bid by  Valeant
Pharmaceuticals International Inc. (VRX)  Bausch’s offer is 134 percent
more than Ista’s share price on Dec. 15, the day before
Valeant’s bid became public.  The deal is expected to close in the second quarter,
according to a statement yesterday from Ista and Rochester, New
York-based Bausch, which is owned by Warburg Pincus LLC. Bausch
said the deal is financed with cash and a $350 million loan.  Bausch was advised by  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and Cleary
Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP. Ista was advised by  Greenhill &
Co. (GHL) , Stradling Yocca Carlson & Rauth and WilmerHale LLP.  Valeant, Canada’s largest drugmaker, dropped its offer of
$7.50 a share on Jan. 30, citing lack of progress making a deal.
Ista had called Valeant’s share “grossly inadequate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
