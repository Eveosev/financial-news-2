New York Knicks All-Star forward
Amar’e Stoudemire is out indefinitely with a bulging disc in his
lower back, the National Basketball Association team said.  Stoudemire played 24 minutes in the Knicks’ win against
 Detroit  two days ago before leaving with tightness in his back.
Stoudemire is averaging 17.6 points and 8.0 rebounds a game for
the Knicks this season.  The Knicks said they’ll also be without point guard Jeremy Lin during tonight’s home game against the  Milwaukee Bucks 
because of a sore right knee. Lin sat out the fourth quarter of
the Knicks’ win against the Pistons.  The Knicks (24-25) hold a 1 1/2-game lead over the Bucks
(22-26) for the eighth playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.
The top eight teams make the postseason.  To contact the reporter on this story:
