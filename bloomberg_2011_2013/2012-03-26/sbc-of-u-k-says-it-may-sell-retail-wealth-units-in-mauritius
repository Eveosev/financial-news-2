HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , which operates
the second-oldest bank in Mauritius, confirmed it’s discussing
the sale of its consumer unit on the island.  HSBC is in talks “concerning a possible sale of its retail
banking and wealth management business in Mauritius,” the
lender said in a statement today. “These discussions are
ongoing and may or may not lead to a transaction.”  The sale had lured domestic and foreign lenders, two people
aware of the negotiations said on Jan. 19. The London-based bank
will remain in Mauritius, it said, through its investment
banking and commercial units. HSBC, Europe’s biggest bank,
employed a total of 409 people on ths island at the end of last
year and had 11 retail branches, according to the bank.  Chief Executive Officer  Stuart Gulliver  is partially
reversing HSBC’s two-decade long expansion, selling assets and
cutting jobs while reinvesting some of the proceeds in faster-
growing markets. HSBC’s presence in the Indian Ocean island
nation can be traced to 1859 when the Chartered Mercantile Bank
of India,  London  and China established a branch in Port Louis,
the capital, the country’s  Mauritius Bankers Association Ltd. 
said in a report on its website.  Mauritius, an Indian Ocean island nation with a population
of 1.3 million people, had 20 licensed lenders as at Feb. 29,
according to the central bank’s website. The domestic retail
market is led by  Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB)  and  State Bank of
Mauritius Ltd .  To contact the reporter on this story:
