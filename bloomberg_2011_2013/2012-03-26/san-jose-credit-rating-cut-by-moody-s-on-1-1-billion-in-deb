San Jose  (8719MF),  California , the 10th most
populous city in the U.S., had its general-obligation and lease-
revenue bond ratings lowered on $1.1 billion in debt because of
dwindling general-fund reserves.  Moody’s Investors Service cut the general-obligation grade
one step to Aa1 from Aaa and reduced lease-revenue to Aa3 from
Aa2, the New York-based rating company said yesterday in a
statement. The outlook for the ratings is stable.  “The rating reflects the multi-year erosion of the city’s
general-fund reserves,” Moody’s said in the statement. “The
city’s management is also being significantly challenged to
manage retirement costs and faces arduous barriers to reduce the
impact of those obligations.”  San Jose,  California (STOCA1) ’s biggest city after  Los Angeles  and
San Diego, spent $245 million on retirement benefits this year,
an increase from $73 million a decade ago, Mayor Chuck Reed said
in a March 5 statement. Retirement benefits cost the city more
than 50 percent of base payroll and consume more than 20 percent
of the city’s general fund, he said.  “The rating and outlook incorporate our expectation that
the city’s fiscal position will remain stable albeit at a lower
level than in recent years,” Moody’s said.  The rating may deteriorate further if the city can’t manage
its retirement costs and if the city’s fiscal position continues
to decline, Moody’s said.  The self-described capital of Silicon Valley is home to
giants including  eBay Inc.  and  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)   To contact the reporter on this story:
