Egypt ’s oil minister said the fuel
shortage that has gripped the country and led to long lines at
gas stations will be over soon, the independent  Al Shorouk  daily
reported today.  The ministry has injected “huge amounts” of gasoline and
diesel into the market to offset a shortage that has continued
for days, Al Shorouk said, citing an interview with Petroleum
Minister Abdalla Ghorab. The crisis should be over in the next
two days, the paper reported him as saying.  It is the latest in a series of fuel shortages to affect
Egypt, sparking widespread discontent in the country as it
struggles with a transition to democracy after the uprising that
ousted former President  Hosni Mubarak  last year.  The Muslim Brotherhood, whose political arm holds almost 47
percent of seats in the lower house of parliament, on March 24
blamed the government and the ruling military council for a
litany of problems including the fuel shortage. Officials have
blamed smugglers for the shortages, saying the subsidized fuel
is being sold on the black market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
