New Enterprise Associates , the
biggest venture investor in Groupon Inc., is seeking to raise
$2.3 billion for its next fund.  The fund, New Enterprise Associates 14 LP, disclosed the
offering in a  filing  today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. The firm, with offices in  Menlo Park , California,
and Chevy Chase, Maryland, raised its last fund in early 2010,
when it brought in about $2.5 billion.  Venture-capital firms, including Accel Partners, Sequoia
Capital and Andreessen Horowitz, have raised fresh capital
following the best year for Internet initial public offerings in
more than a decade. NEA was the  top winner  among U.S. venture
firms in last year’s IPO market, thanks to a 14 percent stake in
daily-deal site  Groupon (GRPN)  and 15 percent ownership of flash-memory
technology provider Fusion-io Inc. The company’s total ownership
in those companies is worth about $1.9 billion.  Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, is an investor
in Andreessen Horowitz.  To contact the reporter on this story:
