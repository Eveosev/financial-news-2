Oil advanced for a second day in
 New York  after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said
accommodative monetary policy is needed to lower unemployment,
making commodities a more attractive investment.  Futures rose 16 cents after Bernanke said further
improvement in the job market will require keeping the central
bank’s  interest rates  low. Oil dropped earlier on concern that
 Europe ’s debt crisis will slow growth. Trading volume was near
the lowest level of the year.  “This was a Ben Bernanke rally,” said Phil Flynn, vice
president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago . “His view of the
jobs market is not quite as rosy as most people thought it was.
It sounds like we’re going to have interest rates low past
2012.”  Crude oil for May delivery settled at $107.03 a barrel on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures dropped as low as
$106.19 before the Bernanke speech in Arlington, Virginia.
Prices are up 8.3 percent this year.  Brent oil for May settlement climbed 52 cents, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $125.65 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. The European benchmark contract’s
 premium  to New York-traded West Texas Intermediate was at
$18.62.  The decline in  U.S. unemployment  to 8.3 percent in February
may reflect “a reversal of the unusually large layoffs that
occurred during late 2008 and over 2009,” Bernanke said.  U.S. Economy  The  U.S. economy  expanded at a 3 percent annual rate in the
fourth quarter, the fastest pace in more than a year, as
households spent more freely. Growth will probably slow to 2
percent this quarter, according to the median of 72 economists’
forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey from March 9 to March 13.  The U.S., the world’s biggest oil-consuming country, was
responsible for 21 percent of global oil use in 2010, according
to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical Review of World Energy released on June
8. The European Union’s 27 members accounted for 16 percent of
world demand in 2010, BP figures show.  “The reaction of the market to the Bernanke comments is
mystifying,” said Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at
Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis, which oversees
$1.3 billion. “There’s absolutely nothing in the speech that we
haven’t heard before.”  Europe’s Debt  Oil in New York dropped earlier after Italy’s Prime
Minister Mario Monti said  Spain  may reignite the European debt
crisis, as euro-area ministers prepare a deal to strengthen the
region’s financial firewall.  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
Germany may back plans for the temporary and permanent euro-area
rescue funds to run in parallel.  “The continuing European saga of poor growth and
unsustainable debt remains a factor in holding prices back,”
said  Christopher Bellew , a senior broker at Jefferies Bache Ltd.
in  London .  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 260,014
contracts as of 3:15 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 509,366
contracts March 23, 20 percent below the three-month average.
The lowest volume of 2012 was 423,323 on Jan. 23. Open interest
was 1.55 million.  Crude in New York has traded between $102.25 and $110.55 a
barrel since Feb. 17, as Western countries have imposed
sanctions on Iran aimed at halting its nuclear program. Iran,
the second-biggest producer in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, pumped 3.45 million barrels a day last
month, the lowest level since September 2002, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Saudi Arabia  is the leading producer.  “We’re going to continue to see this market move on the
headline of the moment without breaking out of our range,”
Flynn said. “We will need a definite resolution to the Iran
crisis to move to new areas.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
