Asian  stocks  fell for a second day,
extending last week’s loss, amid concern exporter earnings are
deteriorating and that Chinese banks may have understated the
risks of loans to local governments.  BYD Co. (1211) , the carmaker partly owned by  Warren Buffett ’s
Berkshire Hathaway Inc., slumped 4.8 percent in  Hong Kong  after
saying first-quarter profit may fall as much as 95 percent.
 Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. (601288)  led mainland lenders lower.
 Leighton Holdings Ltd. (LEI)  rose 2.7 percent after  Australia ’s
largest builder said it won $400 million in new contracts.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.6 percent to 125.64 as
of 7:21 p.m. in  Tokyo , adding to a 0.4 percent drop on March 23.
It sank 1.3 percent last week. The measure has gained 11 percent
this quarter to the end of last week, its biggest advance since
the three months ended September 2010.  “In the absence of positive news, I think people are
feeling like taking a bit of money off the table,” said  Angus Gluskie , managing director at White Funds Management in Sydney
who manages more than $350 million. “There’s a lack of economic
news following key issues.”  BYD fell after the company yesterday said that first-
quarter profit may plunge by between 65 percent and 95 percent.
The automaker slid 4.8 percent to HK$19.94.  Of 631 companies listed in the measure that have reported
earnings since Jan. 9, more than half have missed analysts’
estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Earnings Analysis  China Shanshui Cement Group Ltd. slumped 12 percent to
HK$5.13 after last week posting full year earnings that missed
estimates.  China Airlines Ltd. (2610)  retreated 2.6 percent to NT$13
after reporting a 2011 loss of NT$1.95 billion ($66 million).
The carrier posted net income of NT$10.60 billion a year
earlier.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index closed little changed as real-
estate companies rallied amid speculation the city’s newly-
elected leader Leung Chun-ying will maintain the development
policies of the previous administration.  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, rose 0.1 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 fell 0.2 percent.  South Korea ’s Kospi Index lost 0.4
percent. Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  rose 0.2
percent.  Chinese financial stocks slid on speculation banks had
understated the risks associated with about 20 percent of their
outstanding loans to local governments. The  China  Banking
Regulatory Commission told lenders last month they had
incorrectly placed about 1.8 trillion yuan ($285 billion) of
loans in the safest category of lending, according to a person
with knowledge of the matter.  Chinese Loans  Agricultural Bank of China lost 2.4 percent to HK$3.33.
 Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd.  fell 1 percent to
HK$4.97.  Leighton Holdings rose 2.7 percent to A$23.75 after
Australia’s largest builder announced A$400 million ($418
million) in new work.  Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained 0.1 percent as the
yen fell against 15 of its 16 major counterparts, brightening
the earnings outlook for the nation’s exporters. A weaker yen
boosts the value of overseas earnings when repatriated. Trading
volume on the measure was about 25 percent below the average of
the past 10 sessions.  Japanese exporters gained.  Kyocera Corp. (6971) , an electronics
maker, climbed 1.2 percent to 7,570 yen. Nissan Motor Co., a
carmaker that gets about 80 percent of its revenue overseas,
jumped 2.5 percent to 876 yen.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 11 percent this year
through last week on optimism the  U.S. economy  is recovering and
central banks from China to Japan and  Europe  will take measures
to spur growth. The increase boosted the value of stocks in the
measure to 14.9 times estimated earnings on average, higher than
13.4 times for the S&P 500 and 11.1 times for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
