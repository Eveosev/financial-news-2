Kenya  and Uganda’s government must
upgrade infrastructure at the town Malaba on their mutual border
to cater for increased traffic from South Sudan, the Kenya
Shippers Council said.  South Sudanese trade via Kenya’s port of  Mombasa  surged 87
percent last year to 417,033 metric tons, Kenya Ports Authority
statistics show. South Sudan increasingly favors using Malaba to
transit the goods because of insecurity and damaged roads at
Lokichogio on its border with Kenya, Humphrey Kisembe, an
economist at the council, said in an interview today in Mombasa.  “The road to the border is still narrow making it difficult
for trucks to maneuver,” Kisembe said. “The joint Kenya Revenue
Authority and Uganda Revenue Authority verification staff
operating on the Ugandan side are working in a dusty and
unfriendly makeshift tent that cannot accommodate computers,
resulting into duplication of work.”  Africa could double intra-regional trade by improving
transport infrastructure and easing non-tariff barriers
including customs procedures, according to the  World Bank . Trade
within the continent accounts for 12 percent of the total,
compared with 35 percent in  Latin America , almost 50 percent in
Asia and about 70 percent in  Europe , according to the
Washington-based lender.  Mombasa, East Africa’s biggest port, handled 5.59 million
tons of cargo in 2011, compared with 5.38 million tons a year
earlier, according to the ports authority.  South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in July 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
