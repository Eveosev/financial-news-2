Bovespa futures rose, a sign the
equity gauge may gain for the first time in five days, as higher
commodities prices boosted the outlook for producers and a
report showed  Brazil ’s economy contracted less than forecast.  Oil company  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  and iron-ore producer
 Vale SA (VALE5)  advanced in Frankfurt trading, following crude and
metals higher.  Marfrig Alimentos SA (MRFG3) ,  Latin America ’s second-
largest beef producer, may be active after reporting a net loss
of 141.5 million reais ($78.3 million) in the fourth quarter,
compared with a 158.1 million-real profit a year earlier.  Bovespa futures rose 0.9 percent to 66,715 at 9:39 a.m. in
Sao Paulo. The real was little changed at 1.8092 per  U.S.
dollar .  “The Brazilian economy seems to be doing well,” Clodoir Vieira, an economist at brokerage Souza Barros Corretora, said
by phone from  Sao Paulo . “The main threat for this recovery is
a deeper-than-expected slowdown in the world. Investors will
keep watching economic data coming from abroad.”  In Brazil, the seasonally adjusted economic activity index,
a proxy for gross domestic product, fell 0.13 percent in January
from December, the central bank said in a report published on
its website. Economists had expected a contraction of 0.5
percent, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey
of 26 analysts.  Commodities Climb  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw materials
climbed 0.3 percent and the MSCI All-Country World Index gained
0.2 percent after a report showed German business confidence
unexpectedly increased in March.  Brazil’s benchmark equity measure has advanced 16 percent
this year after slumping 18 percent in 2011, buoyed by interest-
rate cuts in Brazil, signs of growth in the U.S. and speculation
 Europe  may be closer to solving its debt crisis. The gauge
trades at 10.8 times analysts’ earnings estimates, which
compares with a 10.6 ratio for MSCI Inc.’s measure of 21
developing nations’ equities, weekly data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  Traders moved 6.18 billion reais in stocks in Sao Paulo on
March 23, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with a
daily average of 7.19 billion reais this year through March 16,
according to data from the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
