Stress tests of  European (BEBANKS)  banks
should focus less on capital benchmarks and more on “diagnostic
tools” next year, one of  Europe ’s top bank regulators said.  Matthew Elderfield, the deputy governor of the Irish
central bank and a senior member of the European Banking
Authority, said stress tests that encourage banks to hoard
capital may make economic downturns more severe.  It would be “sensible to recalibrate the European approach
to stress testing in the next period,” Elderfield said in a
speech in Berlin today.  European banks won’t face stress tests this year because
they are in the process of reviewing their balance sheets to
protect against the region’s sovereign-debt crisis. Banks plan
to raise about 98 billion euros ($130.6 billion) in new capital
by the end of June, the EBA said last month on its website.  “I would like to see that we use this breathing space
wisely to consider the future design of stress tests and the
operational flexibility of firewall structures,” Elderfield
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
