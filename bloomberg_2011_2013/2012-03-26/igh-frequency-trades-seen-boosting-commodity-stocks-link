An increase in high-frequency
trading in commodities is boosting the short-term correlation
between prices for raw materials, including oil and food, with
stocks and other assets, a study found.  From the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in
September 2008, commodities have developed a correlation with
U.S. stock markets at periods from one second to five minutes
with the advance of high-frequency trading, which uses
algorithms to analyse markets and execute orders, according to a
study by Geneva-based economic affairs officers David Bicchetti
and Nicolas Maystre at the United Nations Conference on Trade
and Development.  “High-frequency trading strategies, in particular the
trend-following ones, are playing a key role,” Bicchetti and
Maystre wrote. “The financialization of commodity markets has
an impact on the price determination process. Commodity markets
are more and more prone to events in global financial markets
and are likely to deviate from their fundamentals.”  High-frequency trading became more prevalent with technical
innovation and introduction of full electronic trading, and also
as investors opted for more active strategies, according to a
 copy  of the forthcoming UNCTAD discussion paper posted on the
Munich Personal RePEc Archive on March 20.  Increased correlation with other assets “questions the
diversification strategy” in commodities, according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
