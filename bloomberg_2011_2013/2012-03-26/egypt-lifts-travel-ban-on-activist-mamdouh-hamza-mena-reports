Egypt ’s State Security prosecutors
have lifted a travel ban on Mamdouh Hamza, a leading activist in
the uprising that ousted former President  Hosni Mubarak , the
state-run  news agency  reported today.  Hamza, who headed the National Council, a loose coalition
of political groups, movements, activists and organizations that
played a prominent role in the mass uprising against Mubarak
last year, was freed after questioning, the Middle East News
Agency reported, without saying how it obtained the information.
It said authorities had asked him about allegations that he had
stoked unrest and incited violence, which he denied.  The industrialist and civil engineer was among a group of
prominent activists who came under fire following the Jan. 25
uprising as protests, strikes and rallies brought daily life to
a virtual standstill and damaged the economy of the Arab world’s
most populous nation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
