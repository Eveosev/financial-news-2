Taiwan’s dollar strengthened after
foreign investors added to holdings of the island’s stocks on
optimism the economy is proving resilient to the global slowdown.
 Government bonds  were steady.  Global funds bought $223 million more local shares than
they sold last week, taking net purchases this year to $5
billion, according to exchange data. Export orders rose 17.6
percent in February, the most since 2010, official data showed
last week. The government plans to sell NT$185 billion ($6.3
billion) of bonds in the second quarter, less than the NT$225
billion it sold in the first three months of the year, the
 finance ministry  announced March 23.  “Foreign funds are still interested in Taiwanese stocks,”
said Stanford Chen, a Taipei-based fixed-income manager at KGI
Securities Co. “Traders were expecting one less bond sale next
quarter, so the sale schedule didn’t really come as a big
surprise.”  Taiwan ’s dollar traded at NT$29.575 against its U.S.
counterpart as of 10 a.m. local time, compared with NT$29.585 on
March 23, according to Taipei Forex Inc. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings that traders use
to price options, dropped 33 basis points, or 0.33 percentage
point, to 4.20 percent, the lowest since September 2010.  The yield on the government’s 1.25 percent bonds due March
2022 was little changed at 1.282 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market. The overnight  money-market  rate was steady at
0.395 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
