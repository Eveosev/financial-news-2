OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP)  , Hungary’s
largest lender, slumped as European banking stocks retreated on
concern the region’s debt crisis will spread.  The shares fell 0.5 percent to 3,880 forint by 12:18 p.m.
in Budapest. The benchmark BUX stock index, in which OTP has a
28 percent  weighting , declined 0.3 percent to 19,079.72.  Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  warned that Spain could
reignite the European debt crisis as euro-area ministers this
week prepare a deal to strengthen the region’s financial
firewall. Hungary, the European Union’s most indebted eastern
member, has failed for more than four months to start talks on
aid from the EU and the International Monetary Fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
