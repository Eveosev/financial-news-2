Columbia University’s trustees sued
the biotechnology analysis firm  Illumina Inc. (ILMN)  and accuse it of
infringing five U.S. patents for gene sequencing used in medical
research.  Illumina is wrongly using the protected technology,
assigned to New York’s Columbia, the school said in a complaint
filed today in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware.  The patents, awarded since 2009, “are important to ongoing
genomics research and discovery, particularly in the emerging
field of personalized medicine, which seeks to use a patient’s
own genomic DNA sequence information as the basis for
individualized health care,” the university said.  Illumina, based in  San Diego , is the subject of a
$5.7 billion hostile takeover bid by Switzerland’s  Roche Holding
AG (ROG) , an offer that expires on April 20, at $44.50 a share.
Illumina fell 24 cents to $50.22 at 2:57 p.m.  New York  time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  Columbia asked the court to award damages based on
reasonable royalties and for an order to stop the infringement.  “We believe these claims are without merit, and we will
defend against them vigorously,” Jennifer Temple, an Illumina
spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement.  The case is Columbia v. Illumina, 1:12-cv-00376, U.S.
District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
