South African corn stocks fell to
the lowest level in nine months in February as increased exports
and a smaller-than-expected harvest depleted reserves.  Stocks of the grain declined to 1.88 million metric tons,
the smallest amount since May last year, from 2.56 million
metric tons a year earlier, the  South African Grain Information
Service  said on its website. The country had 1.27 million tons
of white corn and 608,000 tons of yellow corn. The white variety
is used as a staple food in  South Africa , the continent’s
biggest corn producer, while the yellow variant is used as
 animal feed .  Farmers exported corn to markets including  South Korea ,
 Taiwan  and  Spain  in 2011 after a year earlier producing the
biggest crop since 1982, depressing prices. The country started
importing yellow corn in December, the first such shipments
since the season through April 2010, according to Sagis.  “The harvest for the marketing year that ends in April has
been about 400,000 tons smaller than we expected,” Theo Venter,
market analyst at Senwes Ltd., said by mobile phone. “Exports
have been higher than predicted, and this has lowered stocks.”  The limited availability of local corn stocks “has already
been priced in,” Venter said.  White corn for July delivery, the most active contract on
the South African Futures Exchange, declined 1 percent to 2,301
rand ($303) a ton in Johannesburg. The contract has gained 15
percent this year. Yellow corn for July delivery closed 0.5
percent lower at 2,199 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
