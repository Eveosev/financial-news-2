Russian stocks headed for their
biggest gain in almost two weeks after Deutsche Bank AG said
former Yukos Oil Co. billionaire  Mikhail Khodorkovsky  has a
“50-50” chance of winning an early release and after a report
showed German business confidence unexpectedly rose.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  of 30 shares increased 0.8 percent at 3:55
p.m. in Moscow to 1,555.51, poised for its largest advance since
March 14. OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel jumped 1.7 percent,
Moscow utility OAO Mosenergo climbed 1.5 percent and state-
controlled lender VTB Group added 1.7 percent.  The odds of Khodorkovsky being freed are “significantly
higher than anytime in the past,”  Yaroslav Lissovolik , Deutsche
Bank’s head of research and strategy for Russia, said in a note
to clients distributed today. The Kremlin’s human rights council
this month urged outgoing President  Dmitry Medvedev  to pardon
Khodorkovsky before Putin’s inauguration, which is scheduled for
May 7.  Releasing Khodorkovsky would boost Russian stocks 5 percent
to 10 percent, Lissovolik said in the note. He declined to
comment further when reached by phone today. The Russian gauge
surged as much as 1.6 percent in August 2008 on a report, later
retracted, Khodorkovsky had been given parole.  Khodorkovsky was arrested on the tarmac of a Siberian
airport in 2003 and sentenced to 13 years in prison after two
convictions for fraud,  tax evasion  and oil embezzlement.
Khodorkovsky maintains his innocence, saying the cases against
him were retribution for his opposition to Putin.  Review of Verdict  Medvedev ordered a review of guilty verdicts against
Khodorkovsky and his business partner  Platon Lebedev , giving
Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika until April 1 to present his
findings, the Kremlin said in a statement March 5.  “The initial knee-jerk would be positive but whether it
held would have more to do with the price of oil and data
indicators coming out of  China ,” said  Chris Weafer , chief
strategist at Troika Dialog, the investment bank owned by
Russia’s largest lender OAO Sberbank. Weafer also believes
Khodorkovsky has a “50-50” chance of an early release.  European stocks rallied after  Germany ’s Ifo institute
reported its business climate index, based on a survey of 7,000
executives, rose to 109.8 from a revised 109.7 last month.
Economists had forecast it to remain unchanged at the initial
February reading of 109.6.  Magnit, Crude  OAO Magnit,  Russia ’s largest food retailer by market value,
added 0.5 percent to 3,625 rubles. The company, based in
Krasnodar, southern Russia, reported last week a 21 percent jump
in its net income for 2011 to 12.3 billion rubles ($360
million).  OAO Sberbank (SBER) , Russia’s biggest lender, surged 1.6 percent
to 98.99 rubles, poised for the highest close in a week ahead of
its fourth-quarter earnings release on Wednesday.  “In light of the ongoing rapid expansion in lending, the
bank is set to deliver invariably strong core income,” said
Leonid Slipchenko, senior analyst at UralSib Financial Corp.,
who predicts a  15 percent increase in the bank’s income from
the prior year.  Oil for May delivery slid 9 cents to $106.78 a barrel on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices rose $1.52 to $106.87
on March 23, the highest close since March 21.  The dollar-measured RTS Index added 1.4 percent to
1,692.26. The ruble strengthened for a second day, appreciating
0.7 percent to 29.08 per dollar.  The Micex is the cheapest of the benchmark indexes for BRIC
countries, trading at about 6 times earnings estimated by
analysts. That compares with about 9.8 for the Shanghai
Composite Index and 15.1 for the BSE India Sensitive Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
