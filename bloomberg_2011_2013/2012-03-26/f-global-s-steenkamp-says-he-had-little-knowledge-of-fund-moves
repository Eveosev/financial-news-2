MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ)  Chief
Financial Officer Henri J. Steenkamp will tell lawmakers he had
“limited knowledge” of the movement of segregated customer
funds in the final days before the firm’s Oct. 31 bankruptcy.  “I was taken up with other very serious matters” as the
New York-based futures brokerage struggled for survival amid
ratings downgrades and regulatory scrutiny, Steenkamp said in
testimony prepared for a March 28 House Financial Services
subcommittee hearing on the collapse.  Representative  Randy Neugebauer , a Texas Republican who
leads the Financial Services investigations subcommittee, will
hold a third hearing on the bankruptcy that left a customer
funds shortfall estimated at $1.6 billion. Among those set to
testify this week is Edith O’Brien, an MF Global executive
identified by former Chief Executive Officer Jon S. Corzine as
having knowledge of transfers of funds from customer accounts.  Financial Services Committee staff members, in a memo
circulated to lawmakers last week, said Corzine gave “direct
instructions” to transfer $200 million from a customer fund
account to meet an overdraft.  To contact the reporters on this story:
