Cadbury Nigeria Plc (CADBURY) , a manufacturer
of drinks and food products, climbed the most in almost six
months after gaining by the daily limit as investors bet its
price will rise.  The stock gained 55 kobo, or the daily maximum limit of 5
percent, to 11:55 naira at the close, the biggest gain since
Oct. 5 and the highest value since Jan. 20.  “Investors are betting that the value of the stock is
currently too low, and that it will rise,” David Adonri, chief
executive officer of Lambeth Trust and Investment Co. Ltd., said
by phone from Lagos. “Investors are optimistic about the future
of the company, not necessarily the present.” Cadbury may pay a
dividend with a yield of about 2 percent, he said.  Cadbury forecast a 60 percent increase in net income to
339.2 million naira ($2.2 million) for the first quarter, it
said on Dec. 6. Pretax profit was seen at 470.5 million naira
for the period while revenue was estimated at 8.73 billion
naira, the Lagos-based company said. The company returned to
profit in 2010, after a loss in the preceding year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
