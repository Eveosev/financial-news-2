Global Ports Investment Plc, a
London-listed operator of container terminals in  Russia ,
recommended an additional dividend payout totaling $32.9 million
after profit rose 23 percent last year.  Net income rose to $147 million from $119 million in 2010,
Global Ports said in a statement today. That missed the average
estimate of $148 million of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Revenue rose 31 percent to $501 million in the period.  The board recommended an additional dividend of 21 cents a
global depositary receipt, based on “the excellent financial
results and strong balance sheet of the group,” which raises
the total dividend for last year to 39 cents a GDR, Global Ports
said in a separate statement.  Global Ports GDRs advanced 2.7 percent to $15.05 at 8:47
a.m. in  London , the first gain in a week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
