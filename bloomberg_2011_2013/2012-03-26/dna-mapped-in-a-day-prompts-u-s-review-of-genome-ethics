Obtaining a complete transcript of
a person’s DNA is getting faster and cheaper, raising ethical
and privacy questions that the government must examine, a U.S.
presidential commission said.  The panel said today it wants public input on developments
in human genome sequencing, including how to balance individual
privacy against societal benefits. The  Commission for the Study
of Bioethical Issues , an advisory panel set up in 2009, plans to
send President  Barack Obama  a report by the end of the year.  “Relatively inexpensive, rapid sequencing of whole human
genomes appears not only likely, but imminent,” the commission
said in a  filing . “This prospect raises many questions for the
scientific, medical, ethics and patient communities related to
how this information can and ought” to be used and regulated.  Translating an entire human genome required more than a
decade of research and billions of dollars by the government’s
Human  Genome Project , which completed the first sequence in
2003. Now, Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd. plans to sell a
genome sequencer the size of a USB memory stick for $900 by the
end of this year and companies including  Life Technologies Corp. (LIFE) 
and  Illumina Inc. (ILMN)  promise genomes sequenced in a day.  “It’s going to be hard to put a one-size-fits all
regulation on this,” said Sharon Terry, chief executive officer
of Genetic Alliance, a Washington-based group that advocates for
expanded use of genetic data in medicine. Guidance and clinical-
practice suggestions “would be quite useful,” she said.  May Deadline  Public comments are due by May 25, and the panel plans to
spend six months on its research. The result may be government
guidance on how the tests are used and how the data they produce
are shared with patients, Terry said in a telephone interview.  While cheap and quick testing means people can find out
earlier about predisposition to diseases, they “might worry
about things that are not completely solid in their evidence,”
she said.  Patients should be encouraged to share their genetic
information and medical history with researchers, “so we do
understand what it means,” Terry said. Her group supports
giving individuals final say over use of their data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
