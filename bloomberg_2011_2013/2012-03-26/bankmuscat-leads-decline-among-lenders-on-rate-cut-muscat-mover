BankMuscat SAOG (BKMB) , Oman’s biggest
lender by assets, fell the most in more than a week after the
country’s central bank cut interest rates on personal loans.  The shares tumbled 3.2 percent, the most since March 18, to
0.577 Omani rial at the 1 p.m. close in Muscat.  Bank Dhofar SAOG (BKDB) 
slid 3.3 percent to 0.550 rial, the lowest level since March 12.
The benchmark  MSM30 Index (MSM30)  retreated 1.5 percent, the most since
Aug. 9, to 5,826.22. About 2.6 million shares of BankMuscat
traded today, the most this month.  “Clearly if you look at the banking sector, it had an
immediate reaction to the central bank’s announcement,” said
Kanaga Sundar, head of research at Gulf Baader Capital Markets
SAOC in Muscat. The decision may have a “short- to medium-term
impact on the profitability of banks,” he said by phone today.  The central bank said in a statement yesterday it lowered
the interest rate ceiling on personal loans by 1 percentage
point to 7 percent “to reduce the financial burden on the
borrowers and to encourage banks to offer more credit.”  The regulator also approved in principle the merger between
 Oman International Bank SAOG (OIBB) ’s business with Oman’s operations
of HSBC Holdings Plc. Oman International shares fell 0.4 percent
to 0.281 rial.  To contact the reporter on this story:
