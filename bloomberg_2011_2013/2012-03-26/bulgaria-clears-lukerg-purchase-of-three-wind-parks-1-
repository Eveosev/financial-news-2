Bulgaria ’s antitrust regulator
cleared the acquisition of three wind parks by LUKERG Renew, a
joint venture between  Italy ’s  ERG SpA (ERG)  and OAO Lukoil.  The Vienna-based company will gain control of Wind Park
Kavarna West, Wind Park Kavarna East and K&S Energy, the
Commission for the Protection of Competition in Sofia said on
its website today.  The wind parks, located off the Black Sea coast in
northeastern Bulgaria, won’t hinder competition as their
combined share of installed capacity and power generated in 2010
is “significantly less” than 5 percent, the regulator said.
The value of the transaction was not disclosed.  Bulgaria aims to meet its European Union target of raising
the share of renewable energy in final consumption to 16 percent
in 2020 from 11 percent in 2010. The target share of electricity
produced by wind and solar parks, hydro- and geothermal power
plants is 21 percent by 2020 from 15 percent in 2010, according
to the Energy and Economy Ministry.  About 450 million euros ($599 million) have been invested
in Bulgarian wind parks by international investors including
 Enel Green Power SpA (EGPW) , a unit of Italy’s biggest utility, AES Geo
Energy, a unit of U.S. power utility  AES Corp. (AES) , and a unit of
German wind turbine maker Enercon GmbH, according to the
Bulgarian Wind Energy Association.  Russia’s Lukoil controls Bulgaria’s biggest refinery  Lukoil
Neftochim (NEFT)  Burgas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
