The  European Central Bank  didn’t
settle any government bond purchases last week.  The Frankfurt-based ECB said today it settled no bond
purchases in the week ended March 23 as part of the Securities
Markets Program. That means it has refrained from buying
 government bonds  for five out of the past six weeks.  It will take seven-day term deposits tomorrow to absorb the
213.5 billion euros ($284 billion) of liquidity created since
the program started in May 2010, a practice it employs to ensure
the purchases don’t fuel inflation. The ECB also said that 4.27
billion euros of the bonds it held matured, decreasing the
amount for absorption.  The purchases have dwindled since the ECB started offering
banks unlimited three-year loans in December, injecting more
than 1 trillion euros into the system. That has helped drive a
bond-market rally and reduced the need for the central bank to
intervene. ECB Executive Board member Benoit Coeure said today
the crisis measures are “temporary” and that policy makers
will unwind them as soon as conditions permit.  The ECB says its bond purchases are aimed solely at
ensuring its  interest rates  are transmitted on financial
markets. The program has nevertheless split the central bank’s
policy makers, some of whom say it blurs the line between
monetary and fiscal policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
