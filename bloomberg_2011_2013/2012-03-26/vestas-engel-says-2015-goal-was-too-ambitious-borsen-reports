Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) ’s Chief
Executive Officer  Ditlev Engel  said in an interview with Borsen
that 2015 targets were “too ambitious,” and it’s up for debate
whether the company should have abandoned them earlier.  Engel said in the interview with the Copenhagen-based
newspaper that internal disagreements about strategy are close
to being resolved. Vestas will conclude a review in April, as
planned, Borsen quoted the executive as saying.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
