The Netherlands will step up checks
on the use of insecticides that have been linked to bee deaths
after rules for their application were tightened, the country’s
food-safety regulator said.  The regulator will monitor so-called neonicotinoid
insecticides, which are used in flower-bulb production, the Food
& Consumer Product Safety Authority wrote in a  statement  on its
website today.  Bulbs treated with neonicotinoids are not allowed to  flower 
in the open field, while application on plants is only permitted
when flower buds are not yet visible, the authority said.
Flowers and buds attract bees, it said.  “Instructions on the use of these products have been
tightened because of possible damaging effects in particular to
the bees,” the food-safety authority wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
