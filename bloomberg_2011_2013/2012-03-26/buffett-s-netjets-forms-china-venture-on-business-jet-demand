NetJets Inc., the business-jet
operator owned by Warren Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , will
form a venture in  China  as rising wealth and trade spurs demand
for luxury flights.  The China operations will be part-owned by investors
including Hony Capital and Fung Investments, according to a
statement yesterday. NetJets, once Buffett’s “No. 1 worry,” is
expanding in China as the country’s growing economy stokes
flights by local and overseas customers, the company said.  “The aviation industry is really picking up now in
China,” Ernie Edwards, president of Embraer SA’s executive-jet
division, said in an interview at a trade show in Shanghai.
NetJets agreed in 2010 to buy as many as 125 Phenom 300 business
jets from the Brazilian planemaker.  Expansion in  Asia  builds on NetJets’ decision in January to
deepen a partnership with  Germany ’s  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  for
private-jet services to 3,000 North American airports. The deals
allow NetJets, which serves business customers and wealthy
families, to nurture ties with clients flying outside the U.S.  Entering the China market will “widen our business moat”
protecting NetJets from smaller rivals, such as Flight Options
LLC, Buffett said in his annual  letter  in February to
shareholders of Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire. “No other
fractional-ownership operator has remotely the size and breadth
of the NetJets operation, and none ever will.”  Zhuhai Base  The China venture will be based in Zhuhai, which is an hour
from  Hong Kong  by ferry, according to the statement. It didn’t
say how many planes the operation will have or when flights
start.  NetJets’ move positions the company to take advantage of
what Embraer projects will be a 10-fold surge in China’s
business-aviation fleet to 500 planes in the next decade. The
country had about 1.11 million millionaire households in 2010,
according to Boston Consulting Group.  VistaJet also said today it will open a business-jet base
in Beijing through a venture with  Air China Ltd. (753) , the nation’s
largest international carrier. The company has a fleet of more
than 30  Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)  jets, which will double by 2015, it
said.  “China has long been a priority market for us,” Thomas
Flohr, VistaJet’s founder and chairman, said in statement. “We
now have the opportunity to build a major presence to serve this
important market.”  NetJets Turnaround  Pretax earnings at NetJets totaled $227 million last year,
according to Buffett’s letter, and the Columbus, Ohio-based
company followed up on the Embraer purchase by ordering as many
as 120 business jets from Bombardier Inc. in 2011.  NetJets was previously “hemorrhaging” cash under founder
Richard Santulli and would have collapsed without Berkshire’s
support, Buffett wrote in his shareholders’ letter. Buffett last
year named Jordan Hansell, a lawyer, to run NetJets, taking over
for  David Sokol  who replaced Santulli in 2009.  Buffett has been seeking Asian investment opportunities
after visiting  Japan  in November,  India  and South Korea in
March, and China in 2010. His regional holdings include stakes
in Chinese carmaker BYD Co. and South Korean steelmaker  Posco. (005490) 
Berkshire’s Iscar Metalworking has also invested in TaeguTec
Ltd., a South Korean cutting-tools maker.  Berkshire, controlled by Buffett, also operates in
industries including railroads, insurance and ice cream. Buffett
has a $46 billion fortune, the third-biggest worldwide,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
