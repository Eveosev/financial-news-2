Kazuhiko Asakawa, president of  AIJ
Investment Advisors Co. (0202964D) , will appear at a parliamentary meeting
scheduled for tomorrow morning in Tokyo to discuss the fund
manager’s loss of pension fund money.  Japan ’s lower house financial committee will question
Asakawa, who allegedly concealed trading losses and fabricated
reports on the assets managed to attract pension funds,
according to Banri Kaieda, chairman of the committee.  AIJ oversaw 145.8 billion yen ($1.8 billion) of clients’
money and lost 109.2 billion yen from derivatives trades
directed by Asakawa over nine years, the Securities and Exchange
Surveillance Commission said last week.  Regulators on March 23 searched AIJ’s Tokyo headquarters
and revoked its registration. They also ordered brokerage ITM
Securities Co. to halt business for six months for allegedly
selling the funds with the knowledge that reports of their value
were false.  To contact the reporter on this story:
