Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
Christian Democratic bloc is holding up a bill to promote the
immigration of skilled workers from outside the European Union,
Financial Times Deutschland said, citing members of her Free
Democratic Party coalition ally whom it didn’t identify.  The plan is among several legislative projects stalled in
an escalation of disputes between the  Christian Democrats  and
Free Democrats, the German newspaper reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
