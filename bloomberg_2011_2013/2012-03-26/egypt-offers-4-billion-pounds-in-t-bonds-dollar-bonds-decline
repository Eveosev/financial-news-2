Egypt  will offer 4 billion Egyptian
pounds ($663 million) in treasury bonds as falling yields put
the nation on track to surpass its monthly fund-raising goal for
the first time since last year’s revolt.  The North African country’s government will sell 2 billion
pounds each of three- and five-year bonds, according to central
bank data on Bloomberg. It last sold similar-maturity debt two
weeks ago at average yields of 16.36 percent and 16.78 percent,
respectively. The mid yield on the securities in the secondary
market was at 16.075 percent and 16.525 percent, respectively.  The government is on track to meet or exceed its 51.5
billion-pound debt sale goal in March, after falling 23 percent
short of the 118.5 billion pounds it targeted in the first two
months of the year, according to finance ministry  data . Yields
had soared by more than 2 percentage points on nine-month and
one-year securities since October.  The central bank on March 20 reduced the local-currency
reserve requirement for banks by two percentage points to 12
percent to help “ease credit conditions in the market.”  The yield on the country’s 5.75 percent dollar bonds due in
2020 gained three basis points, or 0.03 of a percentage point,
to 6.42 percent at 12:14 p.m. in Cairo, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The Egyptian pound lost 0.1 percent to
6.0380 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
