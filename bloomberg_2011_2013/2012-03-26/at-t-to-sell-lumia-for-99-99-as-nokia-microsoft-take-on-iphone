AT&T Inc. (T)  plans to start selling a
Nokia Oyj smartphone with  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  software for half of
what it charges for the iPhone, as the device’s makers seek to
break  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s dominance of the U.S. market.  The Lumia 900, which runs on AT&T’s network using faster,
so-called long-term-evolution technology, will start selling for
$99.99 on April 8, the second-largest U.S. wireless carrier said
today in a statement. The latest iPhone and newest handsets
running Google’s Android software typically start at $199.  Nokia is counting on Microsoft’s Windows Phone software to
reignite sales in the U.S., where the iPhone, Android makers
such as  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  and  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) ’s
BlackBerry control 92 percent of the market. Microsoft is trying
to increase its share of the mobile software market to expand
beyond the slower-growing personal-computer market.  “The pricing is aggressive,” said Avi Greengart, an
analyst at research firm Current Analysis in Teaneck,  New
Jersey . “They are hoping to use price to get people to buy a
product with an operating system they aren’t familiar with.”  To get the $99.99 price, customers need to sign up to a
two-year contract with AT&T. The Dallas-based carrier will also
sell the phone without a contract for $449.99, said Steven
Schwadron, an AT&T spokesman.  Those price points suggest that AT&T is subsidizing each
Lumia by about $350. That compares with a $450 subsidy for the
the cheapest version iPhone 4S, which sells for $199 with a
contract and $649 without one.  Must Win  Nokia Chief Executive Officer Stephen Elop, a former
Microsoft executive, started rebuilding the Espoo, Finland-based
company’s smartphone strategy around the Windows Phone operating
system last year. Nokia had previously focused on its own MeeGo
and Symbian operating systems.  Nokia and Microsoft have said they are willing to spend
money to fuel sales. Microsoft said last year it would pay Nokia
$1 billion to develop and promote Windows phones. Elop said in
October that marketing spending on the Lumia series would be
triple the money spent on previous product sales promotions.  Microsoft, based in Redmond,  Washington ,  rose  1.8 percent
to $32.59 at the close in New York. Nokia  advanced  0.4 percent
at 3.99 euros in Helsinki. AT&T added 0.9 percent to $31.79.  The Lumia 900 has a 4.3-inch (11-centimeter) screen, larger
than that of the iPhone, and an 8-megapixel camera. Customers
can order it online starting March 30, AT&T said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
