The German government will need a
two-thirds majority in the Bundestag to pass legislation
approving  Europe â€™s permanent bailout fund,  Die Welt  reported,
citing the Center for European Policy.  The policy review group, citing article 23 of the German
constitution, contradicts claims by Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  that a simple majority would be sufficient to pass the
European Stability Mechanism law, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
