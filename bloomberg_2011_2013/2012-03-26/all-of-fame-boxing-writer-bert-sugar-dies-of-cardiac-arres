Bert Sugar, the Hall of Fame boxing
writer who was one of the sport’s most recognizable figures with
his ever-present fedora and cigar, died yesterday of cardiac
arrest at the age 74.  Sugar was surrounded by family when he passed away at
Northern Westchester Medical Center in Mount Kisco, New York,
the International Boxing Hall of Fame said on its  website .  “Bert Sugar was a truly colorful character in the sport of
boxing,” Hall of Fame Executive Director Edward Brophy said.
“His quick wit and amazing knowledge about boxing made him a
fan favorite as a writer and as a commentator.”  Sugar was born June 7, 1937 in  Washington , attended the
University of  Maryland  and got a law degree from the  University
of Michigan . He briefly practiced law and then turned to
advertising before pursuing his passion for boxing and writing,
the Hall of Fame said. Sugar became the editor of Boxing
Illustrated in the early 1970s and from 1979-83 he was editor-
in-chief of  The Ring  magazine.  Sugar wrote more than 80 books, including “The 100
Greatest Boxers of All Time,” was a long-time contributor to
HBO Boxing and appeared in several boxing-themed movies such as
“Rocky Balboa” and “The Great White Hype.” Sugar was elected
into the Boxing Hall of Fame in 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
