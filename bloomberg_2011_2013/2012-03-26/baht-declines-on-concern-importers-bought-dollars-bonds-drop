Thailand ’s baht declined, erasing
earlier gains, on speculation importers bought dollars to pay
month-end bills.  Government bonds  fell.  The currency rose as much as 0.3 percent earlier after
investors increased their holdings of the nation’s assets as it
recovers from the worst floods in 70 years. Global funds bought
$266 million more Thai equities than they sold last week, data
from the stock exchange showed. Thailand’s  Finance Ministry 
raised its 2012 growth forecast today to as much as 6 percent
from a previous estimate of 5 percent.  “There could have been demand for the dollar from
importers” ahead of the end of the quarter, said Saktiandi Supaat, head of foreign-exchange research at Malayan Banking
Bhd. in  Singapore . “Portfolio inflows will support the baht,
capping its losses.”  The baht fell 0.1 percent to 30.81 per dollar as of 3:51
p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency has advanced 2.4 percent this quarter.  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2017 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.64
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  High-yield bonds funds have taken in $25 billion so far
this year, while those dedicated to  emerging markets  received
almost $14 billion in a record start to a year as of the third
week of March, according to data from U.S. research company EPFR
Global.  To contact the reporter on this story:
