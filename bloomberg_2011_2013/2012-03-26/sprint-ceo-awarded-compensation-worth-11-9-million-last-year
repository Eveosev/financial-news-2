Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  the third-
largest U.S. wireless carrier, boosted Chief Executive Officer
 Dan Hesse ’s compensation 31 percent last year as the company
reported its fifth straight annual loss.  Hesse received compensation valued at $11.9 million in
2011, when the company’s shares tumbled 45 percent. That
compared to $9.07 million in 2010, according to a regulatory
filing today. The executive also received stock awards worth
$3.22 million and non-equity incentive plan compensation of
$4.84 million.  Sprint last month said it excluded the cost of the  Apple
Inc. (A)  IPhone from its 2011 bonus calculations for eligible
employees. The Overland Park, Kansas-based carrier reported
widening losses last quarter -- its first offering the IPhone --
signaling the best-selling device may not be helping Hesse turn
around the business.  The company sold 1.8 million iPhones in the period, fewer
than some analysts projected and trailing larger rivals  AT&T
Inc. (T)  and  Verizon Wireless . The device also ate into Sprint’s
margins by boosting its subsidy expenses by about 40 percent.  Sprint and competitors sell the iPhone at a loss to get
consumers to sign up for multiyear contracts.  In the fourth quarter, Sprint’s net loss widened to $1.3
billion, or 43 cents a share, from $929 million, or 31 cents, a
year earlier.  Sprint rose 4.4 percent to $2.86 at the close in New York.
The shares have gained 22 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
