Celesio AG (CLS1)  plans to sell its
DocMorris mail-order pharmacy business,  Frankfurter Allgemeine

buyers, FAZ reported in an e-mailed preview of a story to be
published tomorrow. The sale is scheduled to be completed this
year, and the unit may bring a price of more than 100 million
euros ($133.2 million), the newspaper reported.  Rainer Berghausen, a Celesio spokesman, declined to comment
