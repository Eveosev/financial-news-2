Jim Yong Kim, the U.S. nominee to
head the World Bank, will travel to Asia,  Latin America  and
Africa starting tomorrow to discuss developing countries’
priorities for the lender.  Kim, nominated March 23 by President Barack Obama to
succeed Robert Zoellick as the bank’s president, will visit
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; Beijing,  Tokyo , Seoul, New Delhi,
Brasilia and Mexico City to “meet with heads of state, finance
ministers and other stakeholders to solicit their priorities for
the World Bank over the coming years,” the Treasury said in a
statement today. The trip ends April 9.  The trip is the initial phase of Kim’s “listening tour,”
the Treasury said. Kim, 52, president of Dartmouth College and
an expert in HIV/AIDS, is vying for the position against
Nigerian Finance Minister and former  World Bank  official Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, and Jose Antonio Ocampo, former finance minister
of Colombia.  The U.S. is the biggest shareholder in the Washington-based
bank, which has always been led by an American.  To contact the reporter on this story:
