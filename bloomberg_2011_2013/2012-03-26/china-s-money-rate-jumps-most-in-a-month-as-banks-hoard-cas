China ’s benchmark money-market rate
rose the most in more than a month on speculation banks are
boosting capital to meet regulatory requirements as the quarter-
end approaches.  The People’s Bank of China didn’t gauge demand for bill
sales today and asked banks to submit orders for 28- and 91-day
repurchase contracts this morning, according to a trader who
takes part in the auctions and didn’t want to be identified
because the information isn’t public. The central bank boosted
rural credit by cutting reserve-requirement ratios last week for
an additional 379 branches of Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.,
the nation’s third-biggest lender by market value.  “Banks are still hoarding cash and are reluctant to
lend,” said  Frances Cheung , a Hong Kong-based senior strategist
at Credit Agricole SA. “The Agricultural Bank’s case shows the
central bank still prefers relaxing credit selectively to small
and medium-sized enterprises.”  The seven-day repurchase  rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, climbed 33 basis points to 3.30 percent as
of 4:53 p.m. in  Shanghai , according to a weighted average
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.  That’s the
biggest increase since Feb. 23.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, declined three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.17 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 3.99 percent government bonds due June
2021 was little changed at 3.53 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
