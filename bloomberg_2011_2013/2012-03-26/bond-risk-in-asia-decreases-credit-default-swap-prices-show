The cost of insuring Japanese and
other Asian corporate and sovereign bonds from default dropped,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index fell 2 basis points to 159
basis points as of 10 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show.
The index is poised for its lowest close since March 21, when
the new Series 17 started trading, according to data provider
CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  decreased 1 basis point to 151.5 as of
9:06 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices
show. The gauge is also set for its lowest close since March 21,
according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index declined 0.5 basis point
to 142 as of 12:06 p.m. in Sydney, RBS prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
