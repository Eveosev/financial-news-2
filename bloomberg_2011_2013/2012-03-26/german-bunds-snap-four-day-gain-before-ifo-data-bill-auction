German  government bonds  snapped a
four day advance before data that may show German business
confidence held at a seven-month high this month.  German 10-year yields rose from near a one week low as
 Europe ’s largest economy prepares to auction as much as 3
billion euros ($4 billion) of 12-month zero-coupon government
bills.  France  is scheduled to offer as much as 6.9 billion euros
of 84-, 161-day and 343-day bills.  The German 10-year yield rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.88 percent at 7:13 a.m. in  London . The 2
percent bond due January 2022 fell 0.15, or 1.50 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 101.04. The yield dropped 19 basis
points last week, the most since the five days ended Dec. 16,
and declined as low as 1.86 percent on March 26.  The Munich-based Ifo institute may say its business climate
index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives, stayed at
February’s reading of 109.6, according to the median estimate of
44 economists in a Bloomberg News  survey . That matches the
highest reading since July. A separate report may show Italian
 consumer confidence  fell in March.  German bunds have handed investors a loss of 0.1 percent
over the past year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
French bonds have gained 1.9 percent and Spanish securities have
risen 1 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
