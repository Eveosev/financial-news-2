Acibadem Saglik Hizmetleri &
Ticaret AS (ACIBD) ,  Turkey ’s largest hospital chain, fell after the
market regulator approved Khazanah Nasional Bhd.’s offer to buy
minority shares in its unit.  Acibadem dropped 0.8 percent to 25 liras at the close in
Istanbul. Malaysia’s Khazanah must offer a minimum price of
$13.67 per B class share in a tender to buy Acibadem Saglik
shares from minority shareholders, the Ankara-based market
regulator said on its website on March 23.  Khazanah’s two units bought a 75 percent stake in
Acibadem’s owner Acibadem Saglik Yatirimlari Holding AS in
January, valuing Acibadem at $1.68 billion for its entire share
capital. Khazanah controls 69 percent of Acibadem Saglik through
its ownership in Acibadem Holding, the regulator said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
