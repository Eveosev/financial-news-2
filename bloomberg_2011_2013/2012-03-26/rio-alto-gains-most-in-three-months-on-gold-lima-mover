Rio Alto Mining Ltd. (RIO) , a gold
producer with a mine in Peru, rose the most in almost three
months in Lima trading as gold futures advanced in New York.  The Calgary-based company jumped 7.1 percent to $4.55 at
the close of trade in Lima, the most since Jan. 4, after earlier
gaining as much as 8.2 percent.  Rio Alto extended a rally this year to 45 percent as gold
for April delivery rose as much as 1.9 percent in New York after
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said accommodative
monetary policy is still needed to reduce unemployment.  “Gold stocks are being driven by the recovery of the price
of gold and Bernanke’s comments,” said Eduardo Fernandini, a
trader at Lima-based Kallpa Securities SAB. “There’s a discount
between gold prices and producers, so Peruvian gold shares are
still cheap.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
