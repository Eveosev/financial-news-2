AudioCodes Ltd. (AUDC) , a maker of
technology to enable Internet phone calls, headed for the
biggest decline since October in  New York  after reducing its
revenue and profit forecast for 2012.  Shares of the Lod, Israel-based company slumped 17 percent,
the biggest drop since Oct. 3, to $2.93 by 10:07 a.m. on the
Nasdaq Stock Market in New York. The Israeli shares declined 17
percent to 10.95 shekels, or the equivalent of $2.94, at 4:07
p.m. in Tel Aviv.  Revenue for the first quarter will be between $32 million
and $35 million and between $140 million and $150 million for
the full year, AudioCodes said today in a Globe Newswire
statement. The revised estimate reflects weakness in sales in
 North America  and lower than anticipated government sales, the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
