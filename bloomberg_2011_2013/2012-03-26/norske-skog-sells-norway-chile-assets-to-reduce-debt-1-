Norske Skogindustrier ASA (NSG) , the
second-largest maker of newsprint, sold assets in  Norway  and
Chile as it continues to reduce debt in an industry struggling
with oversupply and falling demand.  Norske Skog sold the Bio Bio newsprint mill in Chile to a
group of investors from the South American nation for $56
million, and the Follum site in Norway to forestry cooperative
Viken Skog for about 60 million kroner ($10.4 million), Lysaker,
Norway-based Norske Skog said in two statements today.  The Chilean sale will “improve Norske Skog’s cash flow and
financial position,” Chief Executive Officer Sven Ombudstvedt
said. The Norwegian sale will result in an accounting gain of 30
million kroner, the company said.  Norske Skog is grappling with about 7.9 billion kroner of
debt after three quarters of losses amid oversupply in the
newsprint market, competition from online media and rising raw-
material costs. Norske Skog decided in November to close the
Follum mill, which had the highest unit costs of all its mills
in Norway.  In  Chile , buyer Group BO plans to continue producing
newsprint at the mill, which has an annual output of about
125,000 metric tons, Norske Skog said. Both transactions are
expected to be completed during the second quarter.  Norske Skog closed 2.9 percent higher at 6.12 kroner. The
stock has risen 17.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
