Cyber crime is a “growing threat”
globally and the second most commonly reported economic crime
affecting financial-services firms, according to a survey by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.  It accounted for 38 percent of criminal incidents for
financial companies compared with 16 percent in other business
sectors, the accounting firm said in a report published today.
About half of the financial-services respondents said the
potential risk of cyber attacks has risen over the past 12
months compared with 36 percent in other sectors.  “Cyber crime puts the financial sector’s customers, brand
and reputation at significant risk,” Andrew Clark, forensic
services partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers said in the
statement. “Regulators are increasingly viewing cyber crime as
a key area of focus and financial institutions are expected to
have appropriate systems and controls in place.”  Cyber crime involves the use of computers or the internet
and includes the theft of personal information, industrial
espionage, reputational damage, financial theft and the
disruption of services. About 29 percent of financial-firm
respondents didn’t receive cyber security training,
PricewaterhouseCoopers said.  Asset misappropriation such as embezzlement and deception
by employees remains the most popular way of committing fraud in
an organization, the survey found.  The survey analyzed 3,877 responses in 78 countries with 23
percent from the financial-services sector.  To contact the reporter on this story:
