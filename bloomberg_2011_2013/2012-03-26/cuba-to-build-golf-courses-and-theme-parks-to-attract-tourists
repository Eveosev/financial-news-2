Cuba’s government plans to build 13
golf courses by 2020 as the communist island looks to offer more
than sun and sand to the 2.7 million people who visit each year,
Deputy Tourism Minister Alexis Trujillo said.  The country also intends to build several theme parks and
add 25,000 hotel rooms as it looks to broaden its image,
Trujillo said at a news conference in  Havana  today.  “They’re all in different stages of negotiation,”
Trujillo said. “It’s a program that includes the participation
of mixed capital that’s now been in the country several years.”  Tourism has become the island’s main source of foreign
currency since the collapse of the  Soviet Union  in the 1990’s
cut off economic subsidies and triggered a recession. While the
country is famous for the dilapidated charm of Havana and its
cars dating from the 1950’s, most tourists go straight to beach
resorts on the Caribbean island.  Visitor numbers rose 7.3 percent last year after U.S.
President  Barack Obama  eased travel restrictions and allowed
people on religious and cultural exchanges to visit the island.
Almost 285,000 Cuban-Americans and 21,000 U.S. citizens have
travelled to Cuba since then, Trujillo said.  There has been has been no significant influx of American
visitors for Pope Benedict XVI’s arrival on the island today, he
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
