Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  Chief Executive
Officer  Josef Ackermann  said that while the solution to Greece’s
crisis reduced the risk of contagion to Spain and Portugal, such
a scenario is “not completely off the table,” N-TV reported.  Europe  has “taken good steps” in solving its debt crisis,
N-TV cited Ackermann as saying in an interview. He added that
some “fundamental tasks” remain, with the biggest being in
mid-term growth and unemployment, N-TV reported.  If Europe’s debt problems are solved in five years, it
would represent a “fantastic achievement,” Ackermann also told
the news channel.  While Europe has “all chances and a huge potential” to
find a solution to the debt crisis, “brave steps” are needed,
the TV station cited him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
