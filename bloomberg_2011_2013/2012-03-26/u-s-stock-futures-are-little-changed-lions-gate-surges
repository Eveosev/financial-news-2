U.S. stocks advanced, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to the highest level since May 2008,
after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said that
accommodative monetary policy is still needed to spur jobs.  The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of companies most-tied to
the economy rose 1.3 percent.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  jumped 1.8 percent to a
record as the world’s most-valuable technology company said it
plans to increase investment in  China .  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  and
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  climbed at least 2.2 percent to pace gains
among the largest companies.  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  added 1.6 percent as
health-care shares rose the most among 10 S&P 500 groups.  The S&P 500 advanced 1.4 percent to 1,416.51 at 4 p.m.  New
York  time, erasing last week’s loss and posting the fourth-
biggest gain of 2012. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  added
160.90 points, or 1.2 percent, to 13,241.63 today. The  Russell
2000 Index (RTY)  of  small companies  rallied 1.9 percent to 846.13, the
highest level since July. About 6.2 billion shares changed hands
on U.S. exchanges, or 6 percent below the three-month average.  “Bernanke is in a difficult situation because the  Federal
Reserve  is mostly relying on the Fed’s speech as opposed to
money to move markets,” said David Kelly, who helps oversee
about $394 billion as chief market strategist at JPMorgan Funds
in New York. “What he’s trying to say is that they’re going to
be pretty slow to remove stimulus.”  Equities rose as Bernanke said in a speech that while he’s
encouraged by the unemployment rate’s decline, the economy still
needs help. The number of Americans signing contracts to buy
previously owned homes held in February near an almost two-year
high, a sign that the real estate market may be stabilizing.  Bailout Fund  Gains in stocks were also driven by speculation the
European Union will increase the size of its bailout fund.
European finance ministers meet March 30 to discuss raising a
500 billion-euro ($664 billion) ceiling on the region’s
financial firewall.  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said Germany may
back plans for the temporary and permanent euro-area rescue
funds to run in parallel.  “Europe took care of a liquidity problem, but the solvency
concern still remains,” E. William Stone, chief investment
strategist at PNC Wealth Management in Philadelphia, said in a
telephone interview. His firm manages about $107 billion. “Some
action to bolster the firewall would be viewed as positive.”  All 10  groups  in the  S&P 500  rose today as some of the
largest companies rallied. The Dow Jones Transportation Average,
a proxy for the economy, gained 1.4 percent. The KBW Bank Index
added 1.5 percent as 23 of its 24 stocks rose. Amazon.com
increased 4 percent to $202.87. JPMorgan climbed 2.2 percent to
$46.17.  Apple Rallies  Apple jumped 1.8 percent to a record $606.98. Chief
Executive Officer  Tim Cook  visited the world’s most populous
country, where store openings have trailed a forecast the
company made two years ago. Cook had “great meetings” with
Chinese officials, Carolyn Wu, a Beijing-based spokeswoman, said
by phone, without identifying the officials.  A measure of  health-care  companies in the S&P 500 rose the
most among 10 industries, adding 1.7 percent. Pfizer added 1.6
percent to $22.16.  Tenet Healthcare Corp. (THC)  had the second-biggest
advance in the S&P 500, adding 5.5 percent to $5.54.  The U.S. Supreme Court opened historic arguments on
President Barack Obama’s health-care overhaul by debating
whether it should rule this year at all. The justices are
considering whether an 1867 law bars them from ruling for now on
the measure that requires almost every American to get health
insurance by 2014 or pay a penalty.  Weight Loss  Arena Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ARNA)  soared 25 percent to $3.01, the
highest level since September 2010. The weight-loss pill maker
faces an advisory panel on May 10 as Food and Drug
Administration staff said in a  report  today that obesity
treatment manufacturers may need to study the heart risks of
their medicines before U.S. regulators weigh approval.  Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW)  rallied 5.9 percent, the most in
the S&P 500, to $75.51. The company’s Sapien device replaces
damaged aortic heart valves as well as surgery, without cracking
open the chest or triggering higher rates of stroke or death
after two years, a company-funded study found.  Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF)  added 4.5 percent to $15.18.
“The Hunger Games” collected $155 million in weekend sales in
the U.S. and Canada, a record opening for the company and for
the month of March.  Safeway Inc. (SWY)  declined 3.4 percent, the biggest loss in the
S&P 500, to $20.42. The grocer was cut to neutral from
outperform at Credit Suisse Group AG, meaning the firm expects
the stock to perform in-line with the market over the next 12
months.  Since IPO  A123 Systems Inc. (AONE)   tumbled  12 percent to $1.49, the lowest
price since it went public in September 2009. The company said
it’s replacing defective battery packs and modules it supplies
to customers, including Fisker Automotive Inc., and that the
flaw caused a Fisker Karma to shut down in a Consumer Reports
test.  The S&P 500 today erased last week’s 0.5 percent decline
and extended its monthly advance to 3.7 percent. The benchmark
measure is poised for a fourth straight monthly gain, the
longest winning streak since September 2009. The index has risen
13 percent in 2012 amid better-than-estimated economic and
corporate data. It trades for 14.6 times reported earnings,
below the average since 1954 of 16.4.  Hedge funds trailing the S&P 500 for the last five months
are giving up on bearish bets and buying stocks at the fastest
rate in two years.  Hedge-Fund Bullishness  A gauge of hedge-fund bullishness measuring the proportion
of bets that shares will rise climbed to 48.6 last week from 42
at the end of November 2011, the biggest increase since April
2010, according to data compiled by the International Strategy &
Investment Group. The Bloomberg aggregate hedge fund index
 gained 1.4 percent  last month, lagging behind the S&P 500 by
2.65 percentage points.  Money managers struggling to catch up with the gains have
contributed to the rally that pushed the S&P 500 up  27 percent
since October .  Market bulls say they are a continuing source of cash that
can move stocks higher. Bears say capitulating hedge funds are
further evidence that equities have risen too far, too fast as
economic growth remains sluggish, warning that the pool of
potential buyers is being depleted.  “It’s encouraged me to gradually increase my exposure to
stocks,”  Barton Biggs , founder of hedge fund Traxis Partners LP
in New York, said in a March 23 phone interview, referring to an
improving economic outlook. “The shift has occurred gradually
in the six or so months since the beginning of October. I’d be
inclined to raise my net long further because the potential to
the upside would be greater” should the S&P 500 fall 5 percent
to 7 percent, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
