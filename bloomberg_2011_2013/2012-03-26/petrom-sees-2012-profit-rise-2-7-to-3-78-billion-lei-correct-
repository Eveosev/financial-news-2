OMV Petrom SA (SNP) , Romania’s largest
oil company, sees a 2.7 percent increase in its 2012 profit as
refining margins improve.  Net income will probably climb to 3.78 billion lei ($1.2
billion) from 3.69 billion lei in 2011, according to Romanian
Accounting Standards, the Bucharest-based company said in a
 presentation  to shareholders posted on its  website today .  “Our objectives are the continued output stabilization and
unlocking the country’s onshore and offshore exploration
potential,” Petrom said in a statement. “Refining margins are
expected to improve compared to low levels in 2011.”  Petrom and its majority owner  OMV AG (OMV)  of Austria benefited
from higher  oil prices  that boosted profits, while investments
in new fields and cost-cutting measures started to pay off. The
company plans to invest 5.22 billion lei this year.  Total oil and gas output in  Romania  may fall to 62.4
million barrels of oil equivalent from 63.4 million last year,
according to the statement. Petrom also plans to sell this year
about 4 million megawatt-hours of electricity produced by its
Dorobantu wind-park and Brazi gas-fired power plant.  Shareholders are scheduled to vote on the company’s budget
plan on April 27.  Petrom  shares rose  3.4 percent to close at 0.393 leu in
Bucharest today, valuing the company at 22.3 billion lei.  To contact the reporter on this story:
