     March 26 (Bloomberg) --Soybean output in  Brazil , the
world’s second-largest producer after the U.S., will drop more
than previously expected after a drought reduced yields in the
country’s south, crop researcher AgRural Commodities Agricolas
said.  Growers will harvest 66.7 million metric tons in the crop
year that started Sept. 1, less than the 68 million tons
estimated on Feb. 27, Curitiba, Brazil-based AgRural said today
in an e-mailed statement. Output will fall from a record 75.3
million tons in the previous crop year.  Growers have harvested 61 percent of the current crop as of
March 23, up from 59 percent a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
