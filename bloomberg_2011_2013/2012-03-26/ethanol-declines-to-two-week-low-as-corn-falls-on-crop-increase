Ethanol futures followed corn
lower, declining to a two-week low in  Chicago .  The alternative fuel slid on speculation that good weather
will prompt farmers to plant the most acres of corn since 1944.
A March 21 Energy Department report showed ethanol  stockpiles 
grew to a record 22.7 million barrels the previous week.  “It’s just a market that wants to tag along with whatever
corn is doing,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at INTL
FCStone Inc. in  Des Moines ,  Iowa . “We built stocks again last
week, so we haven’t alleviated the problem yet.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery slipped 1.7 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $2.275 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the lowest price since March 9. Prices have increased 3.3
percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago was unchanged at
$2.275 a gallon and in  New York  the additive increased 0.5 cent
to $2.365, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast added 0.5 cent to $2.41 a gallon
and in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel sank 0.5 cent to $2.32.  Corn futures for May delivery fell 8.75 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $6.3775 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
