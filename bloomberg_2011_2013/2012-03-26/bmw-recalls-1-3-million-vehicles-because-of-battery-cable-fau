Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , the
world’s largest maker of  luxury vehicles , is recalling about 1.3
million vehicles because of a faulty battery cable cover.  All models of the “previous generation” 5 Series and 6
Series built from 2003 to 2010 and still on the market are being
recalled for repairs at authorized dealerships, the Munich-based
company said in an e-mailed statement today.  “In some remote cases, the battery cable cover inside the
boot of these vehicles may be incorrectly mounted,” BMW said.
“This can result in the electrical system malfunctioning, the
vehicle failing to start and, in some cases, to charring or
fire.” BMW said it wasn’t aware of “any accidents or injury to
persons resulting from this fault.”  BMW is trying to retain its perch as the top-selling luxury
automobile brand in the U.S. amid competition from  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s
Mercedes-Benz and  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s Lexus. BMW in 2011 took
the No. 1 spot from Lexus, whose sales were reduced by
production cutbacks stemming from natural disasters in Japan and
Thailand.  Recalls of more than 1 million vehicles by an automaker are
rare. Toyota, Asia’s largest automaker, recalled more than 10
million Toyota and Lexus vehicles worldwide in 2009 and 2010 for
defects associated with unintended acceleration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
