Canadian natural gas fell as
warmer-than-normal weather in the U.S. pared demand for imports
of furnace fuel.  Alberta  gas declined 3.7 percent. Demand for heat across
the U.S. will trail normal by 35 percent through March 30,
according to forecaster Weather Derivatives. Chicago’s high
tomorrow may be 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 Celsius), 17 above
normal,  State College , Pennsylvania-based AccuWeather Inc. said.  “Canadian imports have been well below year-ago levels
through mid-March,” said Stephen Smith, an energy analyst and
president of Stephen Smith Energy Associates in Natchez,
Mississippi. “Unusually mild weather since November has been a
major factor.”  Alberta gas for April delivery fell 6.75 cents to $1.74 a
gigajoule ($1.66 per million British thermal units) as of 2:35
p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market. NGX gas
is down 39 percent this year.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for April delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 4.9 cents, or 2.2 percent, to settle at $2.226 per
million Btu.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago
advanced 14.9 cents, or 7.5 percent, to $2.1403 per million Btu
on the  Intercontinental Exchange . Warmer-than-normal weather and
reduced nuclear power-plant output in the coming week are
expected to boost immediate demand for gas to fire generators.  Alliance is an express line that can carry 1.5 billion
cubic feet a day from western Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas declined 0.97 cent to $2.0156 per million Btu. At
Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for California
markets, gas rose 5.88 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $2.1435.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 17.2 billion cubic
feet, 422 million above target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 1.9 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.15 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 1.27 billion cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.38 billion cubic feet today, or 52 percent
of its capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.03
billion cubic feet at 1:35 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
