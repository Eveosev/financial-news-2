Brazilian billionaire Eike Batista
said he is in talks with sovereign-wealth funds to sell an
additional $1 billion stake in holding company EBX Group Co.  Batista is seeking cash to aid his quest to become the
world’s richest man, he said today in a phone interview.  He had announced a deal earlier in the day to sell a 5.63
percent stake in his group of commodity startups to Abu Dhabi’s
Mubadala Development Co. for $2 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
