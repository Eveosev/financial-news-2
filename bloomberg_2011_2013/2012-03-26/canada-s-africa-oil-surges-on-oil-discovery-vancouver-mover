Africa Oil Corp. (AOI) , a petroleum and
natural-gas explorer in  East Africa , surged the most in almost a
decade after it discovered crude for the first time in  Kenya .  The shares rose 43 percent to C$3.35 at the close in
Toronto, the most  since  May 2, 2002.  Africa Oil and partner  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  found 20 meters (66
feet) of oil in the Ngamia-1 exploration well, the Vancouver-
based company said in a statement today. The well has been
drilled to about a third of its target depth.  Africa Oil has assets in Kenya,  Ethiopia , and Somalia,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
