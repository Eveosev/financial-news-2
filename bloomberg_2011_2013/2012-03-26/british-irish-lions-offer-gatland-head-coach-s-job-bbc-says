     March 26 (Bloomberg) --Warren Gatland has been offered the
head coach’s job for the British & Irish Lions’ tour to
 Australia  next year, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported.  Gatland, who led  Wales  to a Grand Slam sweep of Europe’s
Six Nations tournament this month, was interviewed for the job
in London last week before returning to his native New Zealand,
the BBC reported, without saying where it got the information.  The Welsh Rugby Union has already enabled Gatland’s
appointment by granting him permission to miss next year’s Six
Nations, the BBC added. Gatland will take Wales on a three-Test
tour to Australia in June.  The Lions, a combined squad of players from the England,
Ireland, Scotland and Wales national teams, are scheduled to
play nine matches in Australia, including three Tests against
the Wallabies. The Lions will also take on the Barbarians in
 Hong Kong  before arriving in Australia.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
