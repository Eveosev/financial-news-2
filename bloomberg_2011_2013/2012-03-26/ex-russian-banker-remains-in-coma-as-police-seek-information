Metropolitan Police appealed for
witnesses to come forward following the March 20 shooting of
former Russian banker German Gorbuntsov in east  London .  Police said in a statement that they believe the weapon
used in the shooting was a pistol and would like to speak to a
London cab driver who picked up Gorbuntsov before the attack in
the Bishopsgate area. The police described his condition as
“critical but stable.”  “He is still in a coma, but as of today doctors are
already trying to get him out of it,” said Vadim Vedenin,
Gorbuntsov’s lawyer, in a phone interview from Moscow.  Gorbuntsov, 45, was a major shareholder in InKredBank from
2006 and owned a Moscow-based ice hockey team, HC Spartak,
Vedenin said. He left  Russia  in 2010 for Moldova and became a
shareholder in Universalbank, Vedenin said.  “He had a business visa and was gathering documents to
apply for political asylum,” said Vedenin.  The police are investigating the attack and are treating it
as attempted murder. The suspect is described as white, 6-feet
tall of slim build, and wearing a dark hooded top. The shooting
is not thought to be gang-related, the police said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
