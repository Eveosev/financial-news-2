The International Maize and Wheat
Improvement Center, or Cimmyt, said it introduced a wheat
variety in  Bangladesh , this month, which is tolerant to the Ug99
strain of stem-rust fungus that wiped out fields in  Kenya .  The new wheat variety, named Francolin, has “good”
resistance to all varieties of Ug99 as well as yields that are
about 10 percent higher than the most commonly grown wheat
variety in Bangladesh, El Batan, Mexico-based Cimmyt wrote in an
online  report  dated March 23.  Wheat is the second-most grown cereal in Bangladesh after
rice, with an area of 380,000 hectares (938,980 acres),
according to Cimmyt. Francolin seed is being multiplied on 55
hectares, and about 150 metric tons of seed is expected to be
available for the next planting season, the center said.  “The danger posed by the Ug99 strain of the disease stem
rust to global wheat production is well recognized, and
Bangladesh is no exception,” Cimmyt wrote.  Cimmyt said it’s working with the Bangladesh Agricultural
Research Institute on the new wheat variety. The introduction of
Francolin was helped in part by a USAID seed-multiplication
program, according to the research center.  The first Ug99-resistant wheat introduced to the country in
2010 was called Hashi, and the two new varieties are expected to
cover more than 5 percent of the total wheat area in 2012-13,
according to Cimmyt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
