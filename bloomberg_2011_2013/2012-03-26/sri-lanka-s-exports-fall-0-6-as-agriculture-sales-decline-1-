Sri Lanka ’s exports fell the most
in three months in January as the island’s sales of agricultural
products, such as tea, declined.  Overseas sales  fell 0.6 percent from a year earlier to
$917.7 million, the  Central Bank of Sri Lanka  said in a
statement today, after rising 24.3 percent in December. Imports
rose 20.1 percent to $1.88 billion.  The island nation aims for shipments to total $20 billion
by 2020 as it reconnects with global commerce after a 26-year
civil war ended in 2009. The central bank devalued the rupee by
3 percent in November to boost exports as  Europe ’s debt crisis
sapped demand, and removed a trading band on Feb. 9, pushing the
currency to a record low.  The fall in exports “was largely attributable to the
decline in earnings from agricultural exports and higher base
in January 2011,” the  central bank  said in the statement.  Earnings from textiles and garment exports in January rose
1.6 percent to $366.6 million, the report showed. Agricultural
shipments declined 13.9 percent to $181.5 million. The value of
industrial exports rose 3.3 percent to $732.6 million.  Exports make up about a fifth of the South Asian nation’s
$50 billion economy, with apparel makers contracted to companies
such as Marks & Spencer Group Plc and Gap Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
