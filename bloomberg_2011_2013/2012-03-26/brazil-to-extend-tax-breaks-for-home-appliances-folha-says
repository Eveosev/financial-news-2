Brazil  will extend by three months
a  tax cut  on sales of refrigerators, stoves and washing
machines, Folha de Sao Paulo reported on its website, without
saying where it obtained the information.  The tax break on home appliances, which may be broadened to
other products, was set to expire by the end of the month, the
Sao Paulo-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
