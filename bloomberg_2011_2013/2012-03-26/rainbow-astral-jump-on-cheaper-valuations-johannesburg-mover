Rainbow Chicken Ltd. (RBW)  rallied the
most in almost seven weeks and  Astral Foods Ltd. (ARL)  headed for the
biggest gain in about six weeks on bets their discount to other
South African food producers make the stocks attractive.  Rainbow Chicken jumped 3.1 percent to 15.20 rand, the most
since Feb. 7, while Astral rose as much as 2.2 percent and
closed 1.8 percent higher at 125.50 rand in Johannesburg, the
biggest gain since Feb. 14.  Rainbow trades on 10.8 times reported earnings, while
Astral is priced at a multiple of 10.9, below the  FTSE/JSE
Africa Food Producers Index (JFPPS) ’s 15.3 times multiple.  Tiger Brands
Ltd. (TBS) ,  South Africa ’s largest food company, has a price-to-
earnings ratio of 16.7, while  AVI Ltd. (AVI) , the country’s second-
biggest consumer goods company, trades at 15.6 times reported
earnings.  “I think if you are a little bit hesitant to pay those
kind of PEs for Tiger Brands and AVI, and certainly there is a
view that those stocks are looking a little dire in price, where
does one go to look for food producer exposure,” Mohil
Bandulal, head trader at Sasfin Securities, said by phone from
Durban. “You have to look further down the line.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
