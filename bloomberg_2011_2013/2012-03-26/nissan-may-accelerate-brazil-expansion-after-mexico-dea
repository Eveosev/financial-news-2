Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , Japan’s second-
largest carmaker, may accelerate plans to expand in Brazil after
Latin America’s biggest automobile market decided to scale back
imports from Mexican factories.  The deal between Latin America’s two biggest auto markets
means “the ramp-up of the Brazilian plant has to be even more
faster than what we are envisioning,” Nissan President  Carlos Ghosn , who was born in Brazil 58 years ago, said in an interview
yesterday in Iwaki, northeast of Tokyo. “This limitation of
exports from Mexico to Brazil makes our Brazilian plant even
more necessary.”  The comments signal Nissan’s increased urgency to add
production in Brazil, where the company plans to spend 2.6
billion reais ($1.4 billion) quadrupling annual capacity by
2014, after Mexico agreed to cut exports to the country by as
much as 30 percent for the next three years. Sales of light
vehicles in Brazil, which overtook Germany in 2010, may climb to
3.8 million units by 2014, according to estimates at  Macquarie
Group Ltd. (MQG)   “It’s positive for Nissan to speed up its expansion in
Brazil,” said Takashi Aoki, senior  fund manager  at  Mizuho Asset
Management Co. (16834)  in Tokyo. “It indicates Nissan is exercising
good foresight.”  Nissan is more affected than  Honda Motor Co. (7267)  and  Mazda
Motor Corp. (7261)  by the trade agreement, according to  Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN)  estimates this month.  Brazil Sales  Nissan, based in Yokohama, currently brings in the bulk of
the vehicles sold in Brazil from Mexico, where its annual
production of 600,000 vehicles is 10 times the capacity in
Brazil. The carmaker plans to begin production at an assembly
plant in  Rio de Janeiro  in 2014 to add 200,000 vehicles in
annual capacity, according to the company.  Nissan has gained 27 percent this year, compared with 35
percent at  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and Honda. Japan’s benchmark
Nikkei 225 Stock Average has risen 18 percent in the same
period.  In terms of earnings, Ghosn said he expects 2012 to be a
“much better year” than 2011 on expectations that the industry
won’t face the types of natural disasters it struggled through
last year and because monetary policy may ease. Nissan is
forecasting the highest profit among Japanese carmakers for the
fiscal year ending March 31 after it recovered faster than
Toyota and Honda from the Japan earthquake and Thailand floods
during 2011.  Datsun’s Return  Under a six-year plan disclosed last year, Nissan plans to
raise its global market share to 8 percent by March 2017,
compared with 5.8 percent in March 2011. The plan includes a
goal to grab about 10 percent of global luxury-vehicle sales by
tripling sales of Nissan’s Infiniti vehicles to 500,000 units.  With low-end cars, the company revived the Datsun brand
this month after three decades, initially targeting entry-level
customers in Russia, India and Indonesia from 2014.  While Datsun will initially sell in those three markets,
Nissan plans to subsequently make the brand available globally,
Ghosn said.  Ghosn, who’s also chief executive officer of  Renault SA (RNO) ,
also reiterated his expectations for the French carmaker and
Nissan to reach an agreement soon to buy a majority stake in OAO
 AvtoVAZ (AVAZ) , Russia’s largest carmaker. Negotiations on the price
are “practically finished,” he said. Renault already owns 25
percent of AvtoVAZ.  Philippe Klein, head of product planning at Renault, said
this month the French carmaker is making use of AvtoVAZ’s
facilities to develop vehicles for Russia -- where car and
light-truck sales last year rose 39 percent to 2.65 million
vehicles, surpassing France as  Europe ’s No. 2 automobile market,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg Industries.  To contact the reporters on this story:
