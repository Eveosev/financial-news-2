Yingde Gases Group Co. (2168)  received
$150 million in loan commitments from ten banks, according to a
person familiar with the matter.  The loan is expected to close this week, according to the
person, who asked not to be identified because the details are
private. The borrower is still accepting commitments from banks
before signing the facility, which will not be increased to more
than $150 million, the person said.  Deutsche Bank AG is arranging the facility, another person
familiar with the matter said on Feb 23.  Ada Kwong, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for Yingde,
declined to comment on the loan when contacted by telephone at
her office today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
