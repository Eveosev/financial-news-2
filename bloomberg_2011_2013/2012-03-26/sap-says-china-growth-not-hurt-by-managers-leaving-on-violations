SAP AG (SAP)  said neither its China
strategy nor its growth plan in the country will be hurt as it
seeks to replace five managers who are stepping down after
violating internal compliance rules.  Shang Ling Jui, head of the companyâ€™s Shanghai Labs, has
left the company and has been replaced on an interim basis by
Clas Neumann, who leads the global development center in  India ,
spokesman Christoph Liedtke said, confirming a report by the
Financial Times Deutschland today.  Yueting Zhou, chief of Globalization Services, and Hua
Wang, head of the Business One product for small businesses, are
also leaving SAP, he said. Robert Viehmann, chief of the
Solution Assembly and Packaging unit, and manager Oliver Wang
have been suspended, Liedtke said, adding that no external party
has been affected by the violations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
