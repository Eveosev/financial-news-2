Indonesia ’s rupiah rose for a
second day on speculation the central bank will support the
currency to help contain inflation.  The rupiah was also buoyed as a drop in crude oil costs
tempered speculation consumer-price gains will quicken.  Bank
Indonesia  will monitor and intervene in the currency and bond
markets to curb volatility, the central bank said on its website
this month. Government bonds advanced as foreign investors
resumed buying debt before an auction tomorrow.  “The central bank wants to ensure rupiah stability,” said
Robitirtanto Ekaperdana, a treasury dealer at PT BNI Securities
in Jakarta. “The market is still concerned about the level of
oil prices and the possible impact on inflation.”  The rupiah traded 0.14 percent stronger at 9,178 per dollar
as of 3:50 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency lost 1.1 percent this month
and touched 9,225 on March 23, the lowest since Jan. 12.  Crude oil prices dropped 0.6 percent to $106.25 a barrel
today, after declining in each of the last two weeks. President
Bambang Susilo Yudhoyono said on Feb. 22 that local energy
prices need to be revised because of higher crude prices
globally. The government raised its target for consumer-price
increases this year to 7 percent from 5.3 percent, according to
a document presented to parliament on March 7.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage points, to 5.88
percent at midday trading, according to the Inter Dealer Market
Association. The yield reached 6.02 percent on March 15, the
highest since Jan. 17.  Foreign investors owned 225.5 trillion rupiah ($24.6
billion) of local-currency  government bonds  as of March 22, up
from 224.7 trillion a week earlier, according to data published
by the  finance ministry  on its website.  The government plans to auction 1 trillion rupiah of
Islamic bonds tomorrow to conclude its offerings this quarter.
It will offer Shariah-compliant notes maturing in 2018, 2022,
2027 and 2037, according to the debt management office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
