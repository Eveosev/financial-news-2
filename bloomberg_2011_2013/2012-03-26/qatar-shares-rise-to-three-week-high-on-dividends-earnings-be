Qatar’s benchmark index rose to the
highest level in three weeks, helped by the second-biggest
dividend yield among Persian Gulf markets and bets public
spending for the 2022 soccer  World Cup  will boost earnings.  Masraf Al Rayan (MARK) , an Islamic lender, advanced for a third
day.  Al-Khalij Holding Co. (KHCD) , a holding company with investments
in manufacturing and cement, headed for the highest close since
July. The benchmark  QE Index (DSM)  climbed 0.1 percent to 8,717.63,
the highest intraday level since March 5, at 11:48 a.m. in Doha,
trimming its loss this quarter to 0.7 percent. The Bloomberg GCC
200 Index, which tracks the biggest 200 companies in the six-
nation Gulf Cooperation Council, fell 0.2 percent.  The 20 companies listed on the index are trading at a
dividend yield of 4.37 percent as of March 22, the second-
highest rate in the GCC after Bahrain. The shares are trading at
10 times trailing earnings, compared with 19 times for companies
listed on Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI) , the best performer among
GCC markets this year.  “The dividend yield is high while the price-to-earnings
ratio is low, with the potential for high growth in profits due
to government expenditure to build infrastructure” to host the
World Cup, said Nabil Farhat, a partner at Abu Dhabi-based Al
Fajer Securities. Qatar, holder of the world’s third-largest
natural gas reserves, plans to spend as much as $88 billion to
host the event.  Masraf Al Rayan rose 1 percent to 27.50 riyals. Profit may
rise to 1.47 billion riyals this year from 1.41 billion riyals
in 2011, according to the estimates of Qatar National Bank
Financial Services.  Al-Khalij Holding Co. climbed 2.2 percent to 16.60 riyals.  Dubai’s measure and Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  fell 0.2
percent. Oman’s MSM30 General Index slid 1.1 percent and
Kuwait’s gauge dropped 0.2 percent. Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul All
Share Index and Bahrain’s measure were little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
