Arab heads of state will agree
proposals to help resolve the crisis in  Syria  during their
annual meeting in Baghdad this week, Iraqi Foreign Minister
Hoshyar Zebari said.  “The Syrian issue isn’t an Arab issue anymore, it has
become a global issue,” he said in a press conference in
Baghdad today. “The Arab summit will put forward some proposals
to help end the Syrian crisis.”  The  Arab League  postponed its annual 2011 summit after the
region was convulsed by a wave of popular protests that ousted
longstanding leaders in Tunisia,  Egypt ,  Libya  and Yemen and
sparked unrest in other countries, including Syria and Bahrain.
Iraq previously hosted Arab League summits in 1978 and 1990.  The heads of state from as many as 12 member countries will
 attend the March 29 summit, Zebari said. While he didn’t list
the attendees, he mentioned that  Saudi Arabia  will be
represented by its ambassador to the Arab League. Syria is
barred from the summit as a result of an Arab League decision,
Zebari said.  Other topics due to be discussed are the Middle East peace
process, terrorism, the Arab League’s internal restructuring and
regional economic issues, he said.  Arab League foreign ministers are due to gather in the
Iraqi capital a day before the summit, and economy ministers a
day before that.  To contact the reporter on this story:
