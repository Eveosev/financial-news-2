Ahlsell AB’s leveraged loans used
to fund the acquisition of the Swedish building-products
supplier by CVC Capital Partners Ltd. rose in initial trading,
according to Nomura Holdings Inc.  A 530 million-euro ($700 million) term loan B maturing in
2019 was sold to investors last week at 98 cents on the euro and
rose to trade at a mid price of 100.75 cents at 9:29 a.m. in
London, Nomura prices show. The seven-year portion pays interest
of 5.5 percentage points more than the euro interbank offered
rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The loan was part of 10.2 billion Swedish-kronor ($1.5
billion) of debt backing Ahlsell’s buyout. A term loan B is sold
mainly to non-bank lenders such as collateralized loan
obligations, bank loan mutual funds and  hedge funds .  Nordea Bank AB (NDA) , Barclays Capital, Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., DNB NOR Bank ASA and  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  arranged
and underwrote the deal as bookrunners, Bloomberg data show. BNP
Paribas SA, Commerzbank AG, Lloyds Banking Group Plc, Nykredit
Bank A/S, SEB AB and  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  joined the deal at signing as
non-active bookrunners and mandated lead arrangers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
