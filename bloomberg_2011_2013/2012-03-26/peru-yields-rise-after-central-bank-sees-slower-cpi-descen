Peruvian bond yields headed for
their biggest two-day rise in six months after the central bank
said inflation will ease more slowly than previously thought,
fueling speculation it won’t cut  interest rates  this year to
boost growth.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 5.51 percent at 2:28 p.m. in  Lima ,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. That takes the
increase in the last two sessions to nine basis points, the most
since the two-day period ending Sept. 22. The security’s price
fell 0.31 centimo from March 23 to 115.43 centimos per sol.  Peru ’s central bank raised its forecast for 2012 growth in
a March 23 report and said inflation won’t slow to the mid-point
of its 1 percent to 3 percent target range until next year. It
previously saw inflation falling to 2 percent this year. The
report suggests the bank may keep its benchmark rate on hold
until 2014 as consumer demand and investment improve, said  Pedro Tuesta , an economist at 4Cast Inc., in a note to clients today.  Local investors may be selling bonds “if they see there’s
now zero chance of a cut in interest rates,” said Estefany Castillo, an economist at Scotiabank Peru in Lima.  Central bank policy makers will probably keep their
benchmark rate at 4.25 percent for most of this year, though
they may have space to cut rates if needed in the second half as
inflation eases, Scotiabank said in a March 12 report.  The country’s annual inflation rate held at 4.2 percent
last month after reaching a two-year high of 4.74 percent in
December.  The sol was little changed at 2.67 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.6690 on March 23, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  The central bank didn’t  buy or sell dollars  in the  spot
market  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
