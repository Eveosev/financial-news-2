U.K. 10-year gilts fell, on course
for their first quarterly decline in a year, as stocks rose and
a report showed German business confidence unexpectedly climbed,
sapping demand for British debt as a haven.  The losses pushed the yield up from the lowest since March
14. The U.K.’s benchmark stock index, the FTSE 100 Index, gained
0.8 percent and the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index rose 0.9 percent.
Treasuries headed for their biggest  monthly drop  in more than a
year and German bunds also slid. Gilt yields rose for the first
time in six days as  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said Germany may
back plans for the temporary and permanent euro-area rescue
funds to run at the same time.  “With the tail risk in Europe starting to fade, the safe-
haven flows into the U.K. could start unwinding,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a strategist in Edinburgh at RIA Capital Markets
Ltd., a broker for banks. “Any rally in gilts will be
temporary.”  Yields on the 10-year  gilt  rose five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 2.33 percent at 4:22 p.m.  London  time,
leaving it 35 basis points higher since Dec. 30. The 4 percent
bond due March 2022 lost 0.50, or 5 pounds per 1,000-pound
($1,586) face amount, to 114.785. The rate fell as low as 2.24
percent on March 23.  The pound was 0.4 percent stronger at $1.5925 after falling
to as low as $1.5801. It was little changed at 83.63 pence per
euro. Europe’s common currency gained 0.4 percent to $1.3324,
after losing as much as 0.6 percent.  German Confidence  The Treasury 10-year yield climbed five basis points to
2.28 percent and the rate on similar-maturity German bunds
jumped eight basis points to 1.95 percent.  The Munich-based Ifo institute said its  business climate
index  increased to 109.8 this month from 109.7 in February,
fueling optimism that Europe’s largest economy may withstand the
sovereign debt crisis. Merkel’s comments signaled  Germany  may
drop its opposition to proposals to expand the 17-nation
region’s financial backstop against the euro-area turmoil.  U.K. bonds stayed lower after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said in a speech in a speech today in Arlington,
Virginia that continued accommodative monetary policy will be
needed to make further progress reducing unemployment. The
central bank bought $2.3 trillion of bonds in two rounds of
quantitative easing from December 2008 to June 2011.  Rallied ‘Too Much’  U.K. debt securities have lost 2.1 percent this year,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. They have declined
as signs that the euro-region’s debt crisis is easing sapped
demand for safety, and amid speculation that the economy may be
recovering enough to enable the  Bank of England  to end its
asset-purchasing program.  The bonds rose last week, pushing 10-year yields down by
the most since November, as the Debt Management Office said it
would issue fewer gilts in the 2013 fiscal year and Chancellor
of the Exchequer  George Osborne  maintained the government’s
austerity drive in the annual budget.  “It just seems maybe we rallied too much at the end of
last week,” said Anthony O’Brien, a fixed-income strategist at
Morgan Stanley in London. “We can still push higher in yields”
to about 2.35 percent by the end of the week, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
