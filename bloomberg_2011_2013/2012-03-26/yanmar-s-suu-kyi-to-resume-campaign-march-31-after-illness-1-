Myanmar dissident leader  Aung San Suu Kyi  will resume her campaign for a parliamentary seat a day
before April 1 by-elections after falling ill in a southern
coastal region, a spokesman for her party said.  Suu Kyi’s condition “is not very serious,” Han Tha Myint,
a spokesman for her  National League for Democracy  political
party, said by phone from Yangon. “This morning she got up and
started to walk a little bit.”  The former political prisoner felt ill and vomited as she
met supporters in the Mergui Archipelago, a group of islands
near the border with  Thailand , he said. Suu Kyi, 66, has
canceled other trips throughout the country until March 31, when
she plans to go to her constituency, he said.  The U.S. and  Europe  are closely watching the vote to
determine whether to lift  sanctions  in place on the former
military dictatorship for the past two decades. Myanmar
President Thein Sein has started a dialogue with Suu Kyi,
released hundreds of political prisoners and eased media
restrictions since taking power a year ago.  Myanmar last week invited teams from 25 countries and the
European Union to monitor the special elections for 48 seats
vacated in the 664-member parliament by lawmakers who took
Cabinet posts or other executive positions in Thein Sein’s
government. Suu Kyi’s party boycotted a 2010 election that ended
more than five decades of army rule.  Suu Kyi is running in Kaw Hmu constituency south of Yangon.
She was greeted by thousands of people on a Feb. 11 visit to the
area, according to her party’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
