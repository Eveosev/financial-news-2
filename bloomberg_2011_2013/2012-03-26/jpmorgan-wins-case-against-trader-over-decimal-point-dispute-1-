JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  doesn’t have
to pay a trader 580,000 pounds ($921,000) after a missing
decimal point in an employment contract led him to believe his
salary would be 10 times what was offered, a London court ruled.  Kai Herbert, a Switzerland-based currency trader, sued
JPMorgan for lost earnings claiming he signed a contract to
relocate to Johannesburg for a salary of 24 million rand ($3.1
million). JPMorgan said there was a typographical error and the
figure should have been 2.4 million rand.  “Herbert took the commercial risk of accepting the offer,
knowing full well that the figure was an error,” Judge Henry
Globe said in today’s judgment.  The trader resigned from  UBS AG (UBSN)  in June 2010 following the
offer from New York-based JPMorgan to relocate to  South Africa .
Herbert didn’t report for work after discovering the discrepancy
and JPMorgan rescinded the employment offer in December 2010.  Herbert has been unemployed since, other than eight months
at  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , where he was fired in a round of job
cuts in November. Banks globally have cut about 196,000 jobs
since the start of 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  ‘Eyes Wide Open’  “Herbert, with his eyes wide open, took a chance and it
has not worked out for him,” Charles Ciumei, a lawyer for
JPMorgan, said in court.  Herbert originally sought more than 2 million pounds, Globe
said. That figure subsequently fell to just over 1 million
pounds and finally to 580,000 pounds.  “There has been gross exaggeration in relation to the
claim,” Globe said and ordered that Herbert pay costs of 85,000
pounds within 28 days. Herbert wasn’t present for the verdict.  Kate Haywood , a spokeswoman for JPMorgan declined to
comment. Dale Langley, Herbert’s lawyer, wasn’t immediately
available to comment.  The case is Herbert v. JPMorgan,  High Court  of Justice
Queen’s Bench Division, No. HQ11X02595.  To contact the reporter on this story:
