Vietnam ’s two-year government bonds
rallied after data showed inflation eased to the slowest pace in
a year, adding to speculation the central bank will cut  interest
rates . The dong weakened.  Consumer prices rose 14.15 percent in March from a year
earlier, the General Statistics Office said March 24. Slowing
 inflation  may allow Vietnam to lower interest rates by 100 basis
points each in the second, third and fourth quarters, central
bank Governor Nguyen Van Binh said March 12, the same day the
monetary authority announced a percentage point cut benchmark
rates.  “Lower inflation should lead to greater macroeconomic, and,
in particular, balance of payments stability,” Matt Hildebrandt,
a Singapore-based economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co., wrote in a
report released today. The central bank will probably cut rates
by another 300 to 400 basis points in 2012, he said.  Two-year bond  yields  fell 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, to 11.52 percent as of 3:19 p.m. in Hanoi
according to a daily fixing rate from banks compiled by
Bloomberg.  The dong weakened 0.1 percent to 20,900 per dollar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank set
the  reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, its
website showed. The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1
percent on either side of the official rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
