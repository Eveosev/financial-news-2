A Tibetan protester set himself on
fire in central  New Delhi  today in protest over the visit to
 India  this week of Chinese President Hu Jintao.  The 27-year-old man has 90 percent burns and has been taken
to a local hospital, Rajan Bhagat, a police spokesman, said in a
phone interview. A crowd of Tibetan protesters carrying banners
and posters had marched to a spot near India’s parliament before
the incident, he said.  As speakers addressed a crowd of about 600 people, the man
set himself ablaze and ran about 50 meters before he collapsed,
the  Associated Press  reported today.  Tibetans say  China  is attacking their culture, religion and
environment with policies that have moved thousands of ethnic
Han Chinese into Tibet in the name of economic development.  Protests have increased since riots broke out across the
region in 2008. In one of the latest incidents in China, a
Tibetan monk set himself ablaze in northwestern Qinghai province
March 14, surviving after security guards intervened, Xinhua
News Agency said.  Tibet’s spiritual leader, the  Dalai Lama  has lived in
northern India since fleeing in 1959 from China’s military
takeover of the region. China accuses the Dalai Lama of waging a
campaign for independence while the spiritual leader says he is
seeking autonomy for Tibet.  Hu will join other leaders of the so-called BRICS nations
for a summit meeting later this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
