French jobless claims rose for a
10th month in February as companies trimmed payrolls with the
nation’s economic rebound yet to take hold.  The number of people actively looking for work in February
rose by 6,200, or 0.2 percent, to 2,867,900, from the previous
month, the Labor Ministry said today in an e-mailed statement
from Paris. The increase was less than half that predicted by
the median of six estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  With national statistics office Insee predicting economic
growth stalled in the first quarter and jobless claims at their
highest in more than a decade, unemployment is a top concern for
voters before presidential elections in April and May. President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  sought to highlight the good news on the jobless
front, noting that the increase in claims is slowing.  There’s been “improvement” amid “a reduction in the
increase in unemployment,” he said today on France Info radio.  French growth slowed to 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter,
defying forecasts that the country would tip into a recession as
Sarkozy and other European leaders struggled to end  Europe ’s
debt crisis.  Today’s increase in claims compares with a rise of 13,400
in January and more than 20,000 in each of the preceding four
months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
