The pay-TV software maker co-owned
by  News Corp. (NWSA)  helped bring down U.K. competitor ITV Digital in
2002 by paying hackers to deconstruct its set-top cards and put
the codes online, BBC Panorama reported.  NDS Group Ltd. (NNDS) , owned by New York-based News Corp. and
London hedge fund Permira Advisers LLP, hired hacker Lee Gibling
after he successfully targeted NDS’s cards, and paid him to hack
ITV’s technology, BBC Panorama reported yesterday, citing former
hackers. ITV was at the time threatening pay-TV revenue at
 British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY) , which is part-owned by News
Corp., BBC said.  James Murdoch, the deputy chief operating officer of News
Corp., was a non-executive director of NDS when the alleged
hacking took place,  BBC  said. NDS denied the allegations, BBC
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
