The  East African Community  said its
trade ministerial council granted Rwanda’s request to extend a
duty waiver on sugar imports by six months.  Rwanda is forecast to import 38,000 metric tons of the
sweetener in that time, the Arusha, Tanzania-based five-nation
trade bloc said in an e-mailed statement on March 24.  Trade ministers from Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and
Burundi provided the extension “following a report that the
country could not take full advantage of a previous EAC
allowance to import 50,000 metric tons duty free due to
logistical issues,” it said. “Persistent shortage of sugar in
the region has continued since 2005, despite the commodity being
a sensitive product and attracting a duty rate of 100 percent.”  Sugar exported from Rwanda to other EAC partner states will
attract a common external tariff rate during the six months,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
