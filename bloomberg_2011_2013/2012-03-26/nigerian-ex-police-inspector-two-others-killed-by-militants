Suspected Islamist militants in
 Nigeria  shot dead a retired police inspector and two of his
friends in front of his house in Maiduguri, capital of the
northeastern Borno state, a security official said.  The shooting occurred after the gunmen tried to attack a
Joint Task Force checkpoint in Maiduguri, Lieutenant-Colonel
Sagir Musa, spokesman for the force, said in a phone interview
yesterday from the city.  “The attack was repelled, the sect retreated through paths
to different locations only to recognize and shoot dead a
retired police inspector and two of his friends,” Musa said.
“The affected area was immediately cordoned off and searched. No
culprit was arrested and no weapon recovered.”  Authorities in  Africa ’s top oil producer blame Boko Haram,
which draws inspiration from  Afghanistan ’s Taliban movement, for
a surge of violence in the mainly Muslim north and in Abuja, the
capital, in which more than 1,000 people have died since 2009.
The group claimed responsibility for multiple blasts and attacks
in the city of Kano on Jan. 20 that killed at least 256 people,
according to the Civil Rights Congress.  To contact the reporter on this story:
