Peru’s central bank made its biggest
purchase of dollars in the  spot market  in six weeks to slow
appreciation in the sol as companies bought local currency to
pay taxes.  The monetary authority purchased $130 million and said on
its website it paid an average 2.5836 per  U.S. dollar . That is
the biggest  amount  since Aug. 29, when it bought $158 million.
Companies are purchasing soles to pay local income taxes before
a deadline for monthly payments.  The sol appreciated 0.2 percent to 2.5820 per U.S. dollar
at the close of trading, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local
unit. That is the currency’s strongest close since 1996, data
from Peru’s financial regulator show.  “The supply of dollars is stronger than normal because of
the tax payments so we’re expecting bigger interventions by the
central bank,” said  Mario Guerrero , an economist at Scotiabank
Peru in  Lima .  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 6.55 percent dollar-
denominated bond due in March 2037 climbed two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 3.54 percent, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.46 cent to 149 cents per
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
