Gold holdings in exchange-traded
products are growing at a slower pace than in 2004-2009 because
some investors may be moving to physical bullion after initial
purchases of an exchange-traded fund, according to Barclays Plc.
 Gold holdings  in ETPs have increased 9.6 percent this year to a
record 2,582.98 metric tons, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
They rose 7.9 percent last year and 19 percent in 2010. Growth
in gold ETP holdings has exceeded 35 percent from 2004 to 2009,
the data show. The following are comments from Cengiz Belentepe,
head of industrial and precious metals trading at Barclays. He
spoke in an interview Oct. 10:  “The question is whether the pace of buying has slowed, or
whether the people have become a bit more sophisticated in
recognizing the costs and liabilities.  ‘‘We’ve seen instances of people coming in, whose first
step is to buy an ETF, second step is to get educated on how the
market works, third step -- I’m going to shift this in direct
gold purchase and storage, fourth step -- let me allocate this
metal into these locations. It’s the early step they are all
migrating through, expressing the same view but in different
ways.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
