JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the biggest
U.S. bank, sold $2.85 billion of three-year bonds in two parts,
including fixed-rate notes with its record-low coupon for a
benchmark offering, typically at least $500 million.  The lender issued $2.25 billion of fixed-rate securities
due October 2015, with an unprecedented low rate of 1.1 percent
for three-year debt, that yield 77 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries and $600 million of three-year,
floating-rate securities to yield 66 basis points more than the
three-month London interbank offered rate, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The coupon undercuts the 1.65 percent interest rate for
three-year, fixed-rate debt the bank obtained issuing $550
million of senior unsecured notes at a spread of 100 basis
points more than Treasuries in September 2010, Bloomberg data
show. Those securities traded at 101.3 cents on the dollar to
yield 0.33 percent Oct. 11, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The new notes may be rated A2 by Moody’s Investors Service,
considered subject to low credit risk, Bloomberg data show.  JPMorgan has $194.9 billion of  bonds outstanding  with an
average maturity of 5.8 years, Bloomberg data show. Average
yields of 2.22 percent on the lender’s bonds compare with 3.84
percent at the end of last year, and with borrowing costs for
banks of 2.61 percent, down from 4.8 percent at year-end, Bank
of America Merrill Lynch index data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
