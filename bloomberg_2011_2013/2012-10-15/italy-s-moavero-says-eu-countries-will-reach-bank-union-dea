The European Union will forge a deal
on banking union as countries settle their differences in the
interest of protecting savers, said Italian European Affairs
Minister Enzo Moavero Milanesi.  “It’s enough of a stimulus to overcome this diffidence,”
Moavero said today on the sidelines of a conference in  Rome .
“There are still some points of divergence, compared with a
considerable number of points of convergence. The objective of
the Italian government is that the first phase, that is the
activation of the single supervisor for the banks that have
received financing, is operational by Jan. 1.”  The  European Central Bank  must decide whether the
 International Monetary Fund  will have a role in overseeing the
conditions of its sovereign bond-buying program, Italian
European Affairs Minister Enzo Moavero Milanese said.  “It’s now up the European Central Bank to identify the
ways and mechanisms by which to best activate the indications
received by the heads of state and government,” Moavero said
today on the sidelines of a conference in Rome.  To contact the reporters on this story:
