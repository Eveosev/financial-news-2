Philippine 25-year bonds fell,
halting a three-day advance, as investors await more details of
a debt swap. The peso weakened.  The government plans to issue new securities due in seven
to 25 years in exchange for shorter-dated bonds after it
completes an offering of notes targeted at individuals, Deputy
Treasurer Eduardo Mendiola said on Oct. 9. The Bureau of the
Treasury will discuss today the final size of the sale of retail
bonds maturing in 2037, BusinessWorld reported. It has so far
received more than 500 billion pesos ($12 billion) in bids for
the 25-year notes on sale until Oct. 22, Mendiola said today.  “The market is trying to figure out how much the
government will raise from the retail bonds and what it will do
after,” said Ryanna Berza-Talan, a fund manager at  BDO Unibank
Inc. (BDO) ’s trust group that oversees about $16 billion of assets in
Manila. “They have announced a plan for a debt swap so the
market is trying to see where the direction is headed.”  The yield on the 5.75 percent bonds due August 2037 rose
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 6.17 percent,
according to midday fixing prices at Philippine Dealing &
Exchange Corp.  Money sent home by Filipinos overseas increased 7.6 percent
in August from a year earlier to $1.8 billion, central bank said
in a statement today. Remittances, which rose 5.4 percent in
July, climbed at the fastest pace in nine months in August.  The peso dropped 0.1 percent to 41.467 per dollar at the
close, according to prices from Tullett Prebon Plc. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, was unchanged at 5.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
