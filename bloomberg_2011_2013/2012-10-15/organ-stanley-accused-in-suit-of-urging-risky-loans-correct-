Morgan Stanley (MS)  was accused in a
race-bias lawsuit of urging a home lender to target black
borrowers with high-risk mortgages so the bank could profit from
buying and securitizing the loans.  Five black Detroit-area homeowners sued Morgan Stanley
today in New York for violating civil-rights laws covering
housing and credit. They claim the bank encouraged New  Century
Financial Corp. (CYFL) , the bankrupt mortgage company, to make
“combined-risk loans” to borrowers who couldn’t pay.  “Though profitable for Morgan Stanley, these combined-risk
loans put borrowers on a path toward default and foreclosure,”
the plaintiffs said in a complaint filed in federal court in
 Manhattan .  The plaintiffs seek to represent thousands of black
borrowers in the Detroit area who received the combined-risk
loans from New Century from 2004 to 2007. They seek unspecified
damages, an injunction against Morgan Stanley and a monitor to
ensure the bank complies with any court orders.  “These allegations are completely without merit,” Sandra Noonan, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley, said in an e-mailed
statement. The bank will fight the claims, she said.  The case is Adkins v. Morgan Stanley, 12-cv-7667, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
