British Airways (IAG)  said it’s continuing
its evaluation of potential replacements for the world’s biggest
fleet of  Boeing Co. (BA)  747 jumbo jets.  BA has split its long-haul jet requirement into planes for
which successors are available now in the form of models such as
the Airbus SAS A380 and Boeing Co. 787, and those for which
appropriate alternatives are still under development, according
to Keith Williams, the IAG unit’s chief executive officer.  The 747 replacement order relates to those future aircraft,
Williams said at a British-Swiss Chamber of Commerce event in
Geneva, adding: “It’s an ongoing process and I can’t say more
than that at the moment.”  BA’s fleet manager, Alexander Grant, said last year that it
planned to assess Toulouse, France-based  Airbus (EAD) ’s A350-1000, the
biggest version of its latest wide-body, and two offerings from
Chicago-based Boeing -- the planned 787-10, a stretch of its
Dreamliner, and the re-winged 777-X upgrade of the 777.  The unit of  International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (IAG) 
has 52 747-400s in service, plus three in storage. The planes,
built to a four-decade-old design, currently carry as many 345
people in a four-class seating configuration, according to the
company’s website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
