The  Philippines  signed today a
framework agreement with Muslim rebels that seeks to end four
decades of insurgency in the southern island of Mindanao.  Philippine President  Benigno Aquino  and Malaysian Prime
Minister Najib Razak witnessed the signing of the accord, which
will create a political entity called Bangsamoro, at the
presidential palace in Manila.  The new Muslim region will replace a failed autonomous
region in the south set up in 1989 and binds the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front or MILF to lay down their arms and abandon
their pursuit of a separate Muslim state.  The talks with the MILF, which took place in  Malaysia , call
for a 15-member committee to draft a new law that will need to
be passed by Congress and approved in a local referendum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
