The idea that Democrats are big
spenders and bad for bonds while Republicans are deficit hawks
is being turned on its head in the $10.8 trillion market for U.S.
Treasury securities.  Ever since  Lyndon B. Johnson  defeated  Barry Goldwater  for
the presidency in 1964,  yields  on 10-year Treasuries have
dropped about 40 basis points in the first month when a Democrat
wins, and risen 19 after a Republican victory, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. When applied to the $264 billion in 10-
year notes issued in fiscal 2012, the difference means $15.6
billion in  interest costs  over the life of the debt.  This year’s race for the White House between President
Barack Obama and Republican challenger  Mitt Romney  comes as the
U.S. faces $1.2 trillion in mandated spending cuts and tax
increases starting Jan. 1 if Congress can’t agree to reduce the
deficit, which totaled $1.09 trillion in fiscal 2012. Economic
output would shrink by 0.5 percent next year, and joblessness
climb to about 9 percent if the so-called fiscal cliff isn’t
averted, the  Congressional Budget Office  said.  “It’s the natural expectation that Democrats would be less
business friendly and less positive” for equities, Brett Rose,
an interest-rate strategist at Citigroup Inc. in New York who
has researched elections and their impact on bonds, said in a
telephone interview Oct. 9. That’s “consistent with yields
going lower. Republicans are more business-friendly, which leads
to higher equity prices and higher Treasury yields,” he said.  Biggest Moves  After Obama’s election four years ago and amid the worst
financial crisis since the Great Depression, yields fell by 128
basis points, or 1.28 percentage points, in the first month, the
biggest decline. Republican  Ronald Reagan ’s win in 1980 lifted
them by 64, the steepest climb.  Investors have won with both stocks and bonds this year.
Government, corporate, mortgage and asset-backed debt has
returned 4.39 percent in 2012, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch’s U.S. Broad Market Index, while the  Standard &
Poor’s 500  has gained 15.6 percent.  Treasury 10-year yields declined nine basis points last
week, or 0.09 percentage point, to 1.66 percent. The price of
the benchmark 1.625 percent security due August 2022 gained
25/32, or $7.81 per $1,000 face amount, to 99 22/32. The yield
rose to 1.6 at 8:56 a.m. in New York.  Fed Easing  Rather than politics, financial markets have been
influenced more in recent years by monetary policy.  Yields on 10-year notes, a benchmark for everything from
mortgages to corporate bonds, have fallen from more than 5
percent in 2007 as the  Federal Reserve  cut  interest rates  to
near zero and bought $2.3 trillion of bonds to spur growth. The
central banks said Sept. 13 it will add to that by purchasing
$40 billion of mortgage-backed bonds a month.  Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, has said he would
not reappoint Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , whose second four-
year term expires in January 2014. Lanhee Chen, Romney’s policy
director, said Sept. 13 that more bond purchases are “further
confirmation that President Obama’s policies have not worked.”  Bernanke said that day the central bank didn’t take into
account the November presidential and congressional elections in
its decisions. “We have tried very hard to be non-partisan and
apolitical,” he said at a press conference. “We make our
decisions entirely on the state of the economy.”  Statistically Even  “A more restrained Fed chairman could be a potential
catalyst for rates to move higher,” Mitchell Stapley, the Grand
Rapids, Michigan-based chief fixed-income officer for Fifth
Third Asset Management, said in a telephone interview Oct. 9.
The firm oversees $15 billion in assets.  A Gallup poll of registered voters released Oct. 12 showed
the race between Obama and Romney as too close to call. The poll
of about 3,050, which has a margin of error of two percentage
points, showed 48 percent of respondents would vote for Obama
and 46 percent for Romney if the election were held that day.  Since 1964 yields have averaged 5.74 percent under
Democrats and 7.46 percent during Republican administrations.
During the so-called Great Moderation between 1984 and 2007,
when inflation slowed and business cycles were muted, the
Republicans were in office four of the six terms.  Low yields suggest investors expect slow growth and low
inflation no matter who wins the presidency. Gross domestic
product is forecast to expand 2.1 percent in 2013, down from 2.2
percent this year, according to the median estimate of 99
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  ‘Unusual Period’  A separate survey shows 10-year yields will likely end the
year at 1.76 percent, before rising to 2.02 percent mid-2013 and
2.33 percent by 2014.  “History is not a good guide in this situation because
we’re in a very unusual period in which policy is based on
unconventional methods,”  Darrell Duffie , a finance professor at
 Stanford University  in Stanford, California, and a member of the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Financial Advisory Roundtable,
said in a telephone interview Oct. 12. “We should not expect a
traditional historical response.”  Wars, deficits, economic stress and central bank policies
have influenced the most significant movements of the  bond
market  during administrations since 1964.  Johnson, a Democrat who took office after  John F. Kennedy 
was assassinated in November 1963, faced a fiscal drain because
of the Vietnam War.  Public Enemy  Yields rose to 6 percent in January 1969 when he left
office, from 4 percent at the start of his presidency. The
federal deficit rose to $25.2 billion, or 2.9 percent of GDP,
from $4.8 billion as Johnson funded the war and his Great
Society programs.  Inflation then took root during the administrations of
Republicans Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford, accelerating to
12.3 percent in 1974.  That was when the Fed under Chairman Arthur Burns was slow
to respond to rising price pressures and the Arab members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries imposed an embargo
on the U.S. in retaliation for its support of Israel in the 1973
Arab-Israeli War, doubling  oil prices .  Ford called rising consumer costs in October 1974 “public
enemy number one.” Persistent inflation increases pushed the
10-year Treasury yield to 12.4 percent by 1981 from 5.89 percent
at the end of 1971.  During  Jimmy Carter ’s Democratic administration from 1977
to 1981, Fed Chairman  Paul Volcker  instituted a six percentage-
point rise in interest rates in 1980 to 20 percent to battle
inflation that had accelerated to a 14.8 percent annual rate.  23 Percent  “I remember the highest yielding security had a yield of
23.09 percent,” said Robert Auwaerter, the head of Valley Forge,
Pennsylvania-based Vanguard Group Inc.’s fixed-income group, who
started in the bond market in 1978. “I did many purchases above
20 percent.”  During the Reagan administration, with Volcker still at the
Fed, yields on 10-year Treasuries dropped from a high of 15.8
percent in 1981 to 9 percent in January 1989.  Democrat  Bill Clinton  enjoyed a smoother ride as the
economy boomed in part because of a bubble in technology stocks.  Yields on 10-year notes fell to about 5 percent when
Clinton left office in 2001, from 6.7 percent in 1993 at the
start of his term. The U.S. had annual budget surpluses
averaging $139.7 billion from 1998 through 2001.  Under Republican  George W. Bush  from 2001 to 2009, yields
dropped from a high of 5.3 percent in January 2001 to a then-
record low of 2.04 percent in December 2008, shortly after the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. accelerated the
recession that lasted from December 2007 to June 2009.  ‘Geopolitical Risks’  “I’m not entirely convinced that this year’s presidential
election is as significant as it was in some prior election
years, given the depression of interest rates by major central
banks who continue to fight the great recession and its
aftermath,”  Jack Malvey , chief global markets strategist at
 Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) , which manages $1.3 trillion, said
in a telephone interview on Oct. 12.  “The state of the world’s economy in 2013 and geopolitical
risks outweigh the election.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
