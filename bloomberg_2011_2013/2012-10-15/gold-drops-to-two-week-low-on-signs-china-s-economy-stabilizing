Gold declined to the lowest level in
more than two weeks on speculation that  China  may not need
additional stimulus after exports grew more than estimated in
September. Silver fell to a one-month low.  Gold for immediate delivery fell as much as 0.7 percent to
$1,741.75 an ounce, the lowest price since Sept. 26, before
trading at $1,745.10 at 1:45 p.m. in  Singapore . Bullion for
December delivery dropped as much as 1 percent to $1,742.60 on
the Comex in New York, also the lowest since Sept. 26.  China’s exports increased 9.9 percent from a year earlier,
the customs administration said Oct. 13. That was more than the
5.5 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists.
U.S.  consumer confidence  unexpectedly jumped in October, a
report showed Oct. 12. At an International Monetary Fund meeting
yesterday, China’s central bank official Yi Gang said that
bubble risks remain in housing markets in major cities and
stimulus will be restricted to an “appropriate” level.  “That might mean there’s less chance of stimulus or the
size of the stimulus might be a bit less,” said Alexandra Knight, an analyst at National Australia Bank Ltd. “Precious
metals have benefitted a lot from speculation about increased
stimulus over the last few weeks.”  Quantitative Easing  Gold jumped 11 percent in the third quarter, the most since
June 2010, as the Federal Reserve announced a third round of
quantitative easing, or QE, and China approved infrastructure
spending plans. The European Central Bank held interest rates at
a record low this month after agreeing on an unlimited bond-
purchase program in September. The  Bank of Japan (8301)  kept an asset-
purchase fund at 55 trillion yen ($702 billion) after adding 10
trillion yen last month.  Bullion rose 70 percent as the Fed bought $2.3 trillion of
debt in two rounds of QEs from December 2008 through June 2011.  China’s gold imports from Hong Kong fell 29 percent in
August from July as higher prices deterred buyers, Hong Kong
government data show. China is the largest buyer of the metal
after  India .  Cash gold of 99.99 percent purity on the Shanghai Gold
Exchange fell as much as 1.5 percent to 352 yuan ($56.2) a gram.  Consumer prices in China rose 1.9 percent in September from
a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said today.
That’s near the slowest pace for inflation in two years, giving
the government room to ease policies. Beijing has refrained from
implementing stimulus on the scale of the 4 trillion  yuan 
package it unleashed at the end of 2008, confining its response
to measures such as two cuts in  interest rates , reductions in
bank reserve requirements and accelerated investment approvals.  Spot silver dropped as much as 1.4 percent to $33.05 an
ounce, the lowest since Sept. 13, and was at $33.23.  Platinum for immediate delivery fell as much as 1.1 percent
to $1,633.50 an ounce, the lowest since Sept. 27, and traded at
$1,645.49. Palladium was 0.3 percent higher at $636.50 an ounce,
after dropping as much as 0.6 percent to $630.50, the lowest
since Oct. 1.  To contact the reporter for this story:
