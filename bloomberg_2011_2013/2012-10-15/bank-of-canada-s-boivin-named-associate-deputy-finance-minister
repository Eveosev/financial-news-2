Bank of Canada  Deputy Governor Jean Boivin has been appointed as a top official at the country’s
finance department, following in the footsteps of the central
bank’s two top policy makers.  Boivin will become an associate deputy minister in the
department, according to a statement from the Ottawa-based
central bank today. He will also serve as Finance Minister  Jim
Flaherty ’s deputy at meetings of the Group of Seven, G-20 and
the Financial Stability Board, the central bank said in a
statement. The appointment is effective Oct. 25.  Boivin, who turned 40 yesterday, becomes the third high-
ranking Bank of Canada official to hold the finance department’s
G-7 deputy position over the past decade.  Mark Carney  held the
post before becoming Bank of Canada Governor in 2008. Bank of
Canada Senior Deputy Governor Tiff Macklem was Flaherty’s G-7
and G-20 adviser for almost three years before returning to the
central bank in July 2010.  Carney and Macklem left the Bank of Canada for the finance-
department positions.  Boivin, a pupil of U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke , was an economics professor at the Universite de
Montreal before joining Canada’s central bank in 2010. Boivin
co-wrote papers with Bernanke after receiving a doctorate from
 Princeton University  in 2000. Bernanke was on Boivin’s thesis
committee at the time.  Boivin replaces Paul Rochon, a two-decade finance
department veteran who moved to Canada’s health ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
