The option to sell December European
Union carbon permits at 4 euros ($5.18) a metric ton was the
most traded last week, with 8 million tons changing hands.  Four euros would be a record low for the second phase of EU
carbon market, as the European Commission in Brussels is seeking
to fix a glut in supply. Permits reached a four-year low of 5.99
euros a ton on April 4. The third phase begins next year and
runs through 2020.  The price to buy the 4 euro put option closed yesterday at
2 euro cents a ton, after reaching a record 66 cents on January
6, according to data from the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
 London . The next most-traded put was at a 7 euro strike, where
2.25 million tons changed hands. Put options give the buyer the
right to sell at a certain price. Calls give the option to buy.  The most commonly traded call option was at a strike of 10
euros, with 2.75 million tons changing hands, the data show.  EU carbon allowance futures for December 2012 fell 13
cents, or 1.7 percent, today to 7.70 euros a ton on ICE as of
10:32 a.m. Theyâ€™ve dropped 29 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
