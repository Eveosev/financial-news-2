Renault SA (RNO)  and  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  said
they aim to double annual cost savings from their alliance
within four years, while denying a Reuters report that they’re
reviewing their cross-shareholdings.  “We have an internal goal of 4 billion euros ($5.2
billion) in synergies in 2016,” Rachel Konrad, an alliance
spokeswoman, said yesterday by e-mail. “We expect more every
year.” The two plan to boost synergies from their partnership
to 2.1 billion euros this year from 1.7 billion euros in 2011.  Renault is not looking at changing the corporate structure
of its shareholdings with Nissan, Raluca Barb, a Renault
spokeswoman, said by telephone yesterday. Renault owns 43
percent of Nissan, which in turn holds 15 percent of the French
carmaker. They together sold 8.03 million units in 2011,
capturing 10.7 percent of the global auto market, according to
Nissan’s website.  “Renault’s ability to actually deliver on synergies and
savings in the past have been somewhat hard to see,” said David
Arnold, an auto analyst with Credit Suisse Group AG in  London .  Nissan declined to comment on “speculations or rumors”
about corporate structure, Chris Keeffe, a Yokohama-based
spokesman, said by telephone today. The automaker confirmed the
internal goal of 4 billion euros in synergies in 2016.  The Renault-Nissan alliance was established in 1999 and the
companies have the same chief executive officer, Carlos Ghosn.  Shares of Nissan rose 0.7 percent to 680 yen as of 1:10
p.m. in Tokyo trading, while the Nikkei 225 Stock Average
climbed 1.3 percent. Renault  closed up  4.3 percent at 35.84
euros in Paris trading yesterday.  Lowering Costs  Nissan and Renault share a common purchasing agency for
volume synergy. The Japanese carmaker aims to reach more than 50
percent of common components with Renault, compared with the
current 7 percent, Yasuhiro Yamauchi, Nissan’s senior vice
president in charge of purchasing, said at a briefing in
Yokohama yesterday. The executive didn’t give a timeframe to
reach the target.  Nissan is expanding localized production overseas and
shifting domestic output to Kyushu in southern  Japan  to take
advantage of lower local labor cost and proximity to South
Korean suppliers, Yamauchi said. This comes as the company
targets lowering total costs by 5 percent each year through
March 2017.  To contact the reporters on this story:
