Facebook Inc. (FB) , operator of the
world’s largest social network, is reducing by half a $3 billion
credit line arranged to fund taxes for employees who exercise
their restricted stock units.  The length of the loan, secured before Facebook’s initial
public offering in May, was also extended to 3 years from 364
days, and will probably be used to cover about half of the
taxes, according to the filing.  Facebook had arranged the original $3 billion bridge loan,
along with a $5 billion revolving credit facility, in February.
Its tax obligations are now lower than it had expected because
the value of its shares have  fallen  49 percent since the IPO.  The revised agreement to the loan also named Barclays Plc
and Deutsche Bank AG as exiting lenders from the original
agreement. The financing was arranged by banks including
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc.  The company also made amendments to the $5 billion
revolving credit facility, mainly due to changes related to the
loan.  Tucker Bounds, a spokesman for Menlo Park,  California-based
Facebook , declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
