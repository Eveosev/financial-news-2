Cinven Ltd., the British private-
equity firm that owns  Pizza Express , amassed 4 billion euros
($5.2 billion) for its latest fund, bringing it 80 percent of
the way to its target, two people briefed on the matter said.  The firm, headed by managing partner Hugh Langmuir, is
scheduled to tell investors formally at a meeting in  New York 
tomorrow, said the people who asked not to be identified because
the terms are private.  Cinven, which is seeking 5 billion euros for the fund, has
already started investing the pool since reaching a so-called
first close in March. The London-based firm today announced the
fundâ€™s fourth investment, the acquisition of family-owned
pharmaceuticals company Amdipharm Group for 367 million pounds
($589 million).  Officials at Cinven declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
