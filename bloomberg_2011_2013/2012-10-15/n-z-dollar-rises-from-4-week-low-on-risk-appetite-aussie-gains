The  New Zealand  dollar rose from the
lowest level in more than four weeks against its U.S.
counterpart as risk appetite increased after American retail
sales rose more than forecast in September.  New Zealand’s currency, nicknamed the kiwi, and the
Australian dollar advanced versus most major currencies as
global stocks increased. The Aussie’s gains were tempered by
 Reserve Bank  of Australia Governor  Glenn Stevens ’ statement that
there is scope to further  lower   interest rates . The central bank
will release minutes of its October meeting later.  “Near-term movement is likely to see a domestic impact
from the RBA minutes release, where market expectations continue
to favor a dovish bias,” Eric Theoret, a currency strategist in
Toronto at Bank of Nova Scotia’s Scotia Capital unit, wrote
yesterday in a note to clients.  New Zealand’s dollar rose 0.2 percent to 81.85 U.S. cents
yesterday in New York after earlier declining 0.4 percent to
81.30 cents, its lowest level since Sept. 11. It gained 0.5
percent to 64.38 yen.  The Aussie dollar appreciated 0.2 percent to $1.0253 and
advanced 0.5 percent to 80.64 yen.  The kiwi fell earlier after a private report showed the
country’s services industry shrank. The  Bank of New Zealand  and
Business New Zealand said yesterday their Performance of
Services Index fell to 49.6 in September. It was the first time
since October 2009 that the gauge was below 50, the dividing
line between expansion and contraction.  New Zealand’s dollar has strengthened 3.6 percent this
year, the biggest increase among the 10 developed-nation
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The Aussie has fallen 1.8 percent, and the greenback is down 2.3
percent.  U.S. stocks rose, with the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) 
gaining 0.8 percent. The S&P GSCI Index of raw materials fell
0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
