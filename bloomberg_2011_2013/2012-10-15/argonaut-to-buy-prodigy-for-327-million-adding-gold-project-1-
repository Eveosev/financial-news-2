Argonaut Gold Inc. (AR) , a producer of
gold from mines in  Mexico , agreed to buy  Prodigy Gold Inc. (PDG)  for
C$320.3 million ($327.6 million) to add a project in Ontario.  Prodigy stockholders will receive 0.1042 of an Argonaut
share and C$0.00001 in cash for each share of Vancouver-based
Prodigy, the companies said today in a statement. The offer is
valued at C$1.09 a share, a 58 percent premium, based on the
Oct. 12 closing price, according to a calculation by Bloomberg.  The acquisition and development of Prodigy’s Magino gold
project will help Reno, Nevada-based Argonaut meet its annual
production target of 300,000 to 500,000 ounces of gold, the
companies said. Argonaut shareholders would own about 78 percent
of the combined entity.  “Magino is a highly attractive asset which has shown
continued resource growth,” Argonaut Chief Executive Officer
Pete Dougherty said in the statement.  Argonaut fell 8.6 percent to C$9.58 at 2:38 p.m. in
Toronto, after earlier having the biggest intraday decline since
October 2010. Prodigy rose 39 percent to 96 Canadian cents, the
largest intraday gain since September 2010.  Argonaut’s financial adviser on the deal is BMO Capital
Markets and its legal adviser is Fraser Milner Casgrain LLP.
Prodigy is being advised by National Bank Financial Inc. and
DuMoulin Black LLP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
