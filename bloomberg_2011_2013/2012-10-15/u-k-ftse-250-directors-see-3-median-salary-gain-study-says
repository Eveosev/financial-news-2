The median salary increase for
executive directors at Britain’s 250 largest medium-sized
companies rose 3 percent this year, the same as last year,
according to auditors  Deloitte .  About 30 percent of companies gave no increase, in line
with 2011, while a further 46 percent gave increases of less
than 5 percent, compared with 41 percent last year, Deloitte
said today in a report on remuneration.  “There are some positive trends emerging,” Mitul Shah,
partner in the remuneration team at Deloitte, wrote in an e-
mailed statement. “Salary increases are slightly lower than
last year and bonus payouts are less. We have seen significantly
smaller payouts from long term plans in the last two years than
previous years. Our research suggests that the link between pay
and performance in FTSE 250 companies is improving.”  More than half of finance and property companies have
awarded no salary increases in 2012 compared with 24 percent of
industrial and manufacturing companies and 19 percent of retail
and service companies, Deloitte said.  In 2011, 45 percent of finance and property companies gave
no salary increase to executive directors, according to
Deloitte. For 2012, the median increase in finance and property
companies is zero, compared with 3.5 percent in industrial and
manufacturing companies and 2.5 percent in retail and service
companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
