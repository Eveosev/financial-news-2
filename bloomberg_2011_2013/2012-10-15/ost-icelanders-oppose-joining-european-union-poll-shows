Most Icelanders oppose joining the
European Union, according to a Capacent Gallup poll for
Heimssyn, a group that lobbies against EU membership.  Opposition to joining the 27-nation bloc fell to 57.6
percent, according to the poll published today on the group’s
 website . That compares with 63 percent in a survey conducted for
the group in January. Support for joining the EU fell to 27.3
percent from 37 percent.  Capacent Gallup polled 1,450 people of which 58.5 percent
answered. Heimssyn didn’t provide a margin of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
