Apple Inc. (AAPL)  appealed a Tokyo ruling
that said Samsung Electronics Co. didn’t infringe on the iPhone
maker’s patent as the world’s top two smartphone sellers
continue their global legal dispute.  Apple appealed an Aug. 31 ruling by Tokyo District Court
that said Samsung didn’t violate Apple’s invention of technology
for synchronizing music and video data with servers, a court
spokesman Yutaka Sakai said by phone today. Cupertino,
California-based Apple was ordered by Tokyo District Judge
Tamotsu Shoji at the time to pay costs of the lawsuit.  Samsung, based in Suwon,  South Korea , and Apple have been
 suing each other  over patent-infringement claims on four
continents for more than a year since the U.S. company accused
its rival and partner of copying some features of the iPhone and
iPad. In August, Apple won more than $1 billion in damages in a
 jury trial  in  San Jose ,  California .  Carolyn Wu, a spokeswoman for Apple in Beijing, couldn’t be
reached immediately for comment. Nam Ki Yung, a Seoul-based
spokesman for Samsung, said the company didn’t have immediate
comment.  The two companies lead the global market for smartphones
estimated by Bloomberg Industries to be worth $219 billion last
year. They also maintain commercial ties where Samsung gets
about 4 percent in revenue from selling chips and displays used
in Apple products, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
