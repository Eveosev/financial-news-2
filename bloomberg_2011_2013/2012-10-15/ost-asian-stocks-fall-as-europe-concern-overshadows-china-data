Most Asian  stocks  outside Japan
fell, led by ZTE Corp. and Korea Zinc Co. Japan’s Nikkei 225
Stock Average rose for the first time in five trading days.  ZTE,  China ’s second-largest maker of telephone equipment,
plunged 16 percent after saying it expects a third-quarter loss.
Korea Zinc declined 7.1 percent after gold and silver prices
fell. Japanese machinery maker  Hitachi Construction Machinery
Co (6305) , which gets 17 percent of its revenue in China, gained 2.9
percent in  Tokyo  after China reported the slowest inflation in
almost two years and better-than-estimated exports.  The MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index dropped 0.1
percent to 439.09 as of 7:08 p.m. in Tokyo, with five stocks
falling for every four that advanced. The MSCI Asia Pacific
Index was little changed at 120.81 after swinging between gains
and losses more than 10 times.  “ Europe  won’t recover and that leaves China as a last
resort,” said Kazuyuki Terao, chief investment officer of
Allianz Global Investors Japan Ltd. Allianz Global Investors
oversees about 250 billion euros ($324 billion) in assets
globally. “Investors can’t buy beyond short covering because of
economic slowdown concerns. I think people are expecting policy
measures out of China.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index added 6.1 percent this year
through Oct. 12 as a series of stimulus measures from Europe to
the U.S. and China countered a global economic slowdown and the
 European debt crisis . The Asian benchmark traded at 12.8 times
 estimated earnings  on average, compared with 13.6 times for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and a multiple of 12 for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index.  EU Summit  European Union leaders will convene for an Oct. 18-19

Korea’s Kospi Index fell 0.4 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200

in August, and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose 0.5 percent in
Wellington.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was little changed. The
Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of mainland
China’s stock exchanges, declined 0.3 percent.  Taiwan’s Taiex
Index (TWSE)  dropped 0.2 percent and Singapore’s Straits Times Index
was little changed.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.5
percent today after the gauge slid 0.3 percent on Oct. 12. Bank
of Israel Governor  Stanley Fischer  said the world is “awfully
close” to a recession, adding to concern raised at annual
meetings of the  International Monetary Fund  last week.  Earnings Concern  ZTE slumped 16 percent to HK$10.56 in Hong Kong after
saying yesterday that its third-quarter net loss was probably as
much as 2 billion  yuan  ($319 million), compared with profit of
299.3 million yuan a year earlier.  Angang Steel Co. slid 3.4 percent to HK$4.28 in  Hong Kong

world’s second-biggest economy increased 1.9 percent last month,

a state-backed fund, may be joined by private companies to take
over Renesas as early as next month, the two people said.  Softbank Corp. (9984)  dropped 5.3 percent to 2,268 yen as three
people familiar with the talks said Japan’s third-largest
mobile-phone company is close to an agreement to buy a 70
percent stake in Sprint Nextel Corp. After the market closed in
 Japan , Softbank agreed to pay $20.1 billion to buy the stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
