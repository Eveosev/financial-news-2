Crude oil options volatility was
little changed as underlying futures rose 4 cents.  Implied volatility for options expiring in December, a
measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, was 31.24 percent at 3:05 p.m. in  New York ,
after being at 31.04 on Oct. 12.  “We’re kind of range-bound here again after the rally last
week,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount Options
Inc. in New York.  December-delivery crude oil rose 4 cents to settle at
$92.32 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , after
falling 22 cents on Oct. 12.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
November $90 puts, which fell 17 cents to 29 cents a barrel at
3:34 p.m. with 2,417 lots trading. January $110 calls were the
second-most active, with 1,618 lots exchanged as they declined 7
cents to 59 cents a barrel.  Bearish bets accounted for 51 percent of the 40,120
contracts in electronic trading. One contract covers 1,000
barrels of oil.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bets that prices would rise made
up 54 percent of the 96,432 contracts traded.  December $100 calls were the most actively traded options
on Oct. 12 with 4,679 lots changing hands. They fell 19 cents to
89 cents a barrel. November $95 calls declined 15 cents to 25
cents on volume of 3,941 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $120 calls with
67,836 contracts. Next were December $80 puts with 51,455 lots
and December $125 calls with 45,154.  To contact the reporter on this story:
