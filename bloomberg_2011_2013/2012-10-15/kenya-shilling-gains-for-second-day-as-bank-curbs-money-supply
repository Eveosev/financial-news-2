Kenya ’s shilling gained the most in
almost two weeks as the central bank curbed  money supply  through
its largest sale of securities in a week.  The currency of East Africa’s largest economy appreciated
as much as 1.1 percent to 84.24 per dollar and was trading 0.4
percent stronger at 84.85 at 4:29 p.m. the biggest gain since
Oct. 3 and extending its winning streak to two days.  “The shilling is responding to the persistent mop-up by
the central bank, which is trying to maintain money supply to
ensure stable prices,” Jeremiah Kendagor, head of trading at
Nairobi-based  Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , said by phone.  The Central Bank of Kenya sold 7.81 billion shillings ($92
million) of  repurchase agreements  and term-auction deposits, an
official who asked not to be identified in line with policy,
said by phone. This is the highest amount sold since Oct 8,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Tanzania’s shilling weakened 0.3 percent to 1,576 a dollar,
while the Ugandan shilling gained 0.7 percent to 2,580 per
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
