The base fare on New York City’s
subway may rise 25 cents to $2.50 and monthly unlimited passes
by as much as 20 percent as the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority enlists record ridership to combat rising costs.  MTA officials in a Manhattan briefing today revealed four
possible fare and toll increases for subways, buses, commuter
railroads from Long Island and northern suburbs and river
crossings that would take effect in March. The plans are
designed to net an annual $450 million in additional revenue to
help fill projected budget deficits.  Two options call for base fares to rise to $2.50 and
monthly unlimited cards to $109 or $112 from the current $104.
The other two would boost the unlimited passes to $125 or $119
while leaving the current $2.25 base fare unchanged. All the
plans would tack on a $1 fee for each new MetroCard purchased.  “The reason why we’re having fare and toll increases is
directly related to the increase in our non-discretionary
costs,” such as debt service, pensions, energy, and employee
and retiree health care, Chairman Joseph Lhota said.  The largest U.S. transit agency has been working to dig out
of a fiscal hole exacerbated by the 18-month recession that
ended in 2009. That situation triggered the last round of fare
and toll increases and $93 million in service cuts two years
ago, stoking anger among riders and advocates. The proposed 2013
budget restores about a third of those reductions, as subway
ridership reaches levels not seen in more than 60 years.  The monthly unlimited pass price last rose in December 2010
and the base fare in June 2009.  Congestion Remedy  The final decision requires a December vote by the state
agency’s board, and hearings on proposed increases begin next
month. One opinion was already heard today: Don’t stick subway
riders, said Gene Russianoff, senior attorney at the
Straphangers Campaign, an arm of the New York Public Interest
Research Group.  “Blocking or reducing the fare increase is possible, if we
get more help from  Albany ,” Russianoff said in a statement.
“One promising plan is to generate new revenue by both raising
and lowering tolls on city bridges and tunnels in line with
where there is the most and least congestion.”  Global Comparison  New York’s current $2.25 base subway fare covers a trip
anywhere on the 660-mile (1,062-kilometer) system.  Washington ’s
Metro charges rail passengers $1.70 to $5.75 per ride, depending
on the time of day and length of trip, the system’s  website 
says. On the London subway, or Tube, passengers pay from 4.30
pounds ($6.90) for travel within a single zone to 7.50 pounds to
make a single journey across all nine zones, though most
residents use a prepaid Oyster swipe card, which cuts the costs.  While “no New Yorker likes to be compared to another
city,” riders must consider what their international
counterparts pay, Lhota said.  Boosting the undiscounted base fare would affect the fewest
people, including tourists, Lhota said, as full-price rides
account for 15 percent of total trips. The price rose to $2.25
from $2 in 2009.  Riders who use monthly unlimited cards have been among the
hardest hit by fare boosts. In December 2010, the price rose to
$104 from $89. As recently as January 2005, it cost $70.  At the same time, those riders enjoy some of the deepest
discounts. About 85 percent of riders receive discounted rates,
including 7 percent applicable to MetroCard purchases of $10 of
more. With all discounts taken together, the agency receives
$1.63 in revenue on average per ride.  Budget Assumptions  The plans also include price boosts for riders of the Long
Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad. Most tickets would
rise by 8.2 percent to 9.3 percent, officials said.  Even so, fiscal challenges persist. Officials predict
budget shortfalls of $248 million in 2014, $14 million the next
year and $231 million in 2016. The gaps would widen if the
agency can’t contain labor costs and force riders to pay more,
officials have said. The $13.1 billion budget for next year
counts on both the proposed increases and on negotiating union
contracts without increased costs. Otherwise, deficits would
widen to $2.7 billion by 2016, the agency has said.  The proposals released today also assume the successful
appeal of an August state court decision that struck down a
payroll tax projected to pump $1.26 billion into the agency’s
budget. The suit was brought by officials from suburban
communities served by the agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
