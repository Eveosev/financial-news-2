Money lent to  Spain ’s banks via the
country’s bank-rescue fund, known as FROB, may not be fully
recovered,  El Mundo  reported, citing the transcript of a meeting
between Bank of Spain Deputy Governor Fernando Restoy and
lawmakers.  “In principle, one can’t expect that the total amount
injected into these entities will be recovered in full,” Restoy
was cited as saying.  FROB has put 11.1 billion euros ($14.3 billion) into Bankia
Group, Catalunya Banc and NovaGalicia so far and plans to
provide a further 40 billion euros for these and other banks, El
Mundo added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
