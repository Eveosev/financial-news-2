The ruble dropped for a second day
against the dollar after oil, Russia’s chief export earner, fell
in  New York .  The ruble depreciated 0.2 percent to 31.0920 per dollar by
7 p.m. in Moscow. The Russian currency advanced 0.1 percent
versus the euro to 40.1975 and was less than 0.1 percent weaker
than the central bank’s euro-dollar target basket.  Oil fell 1.8 percent to $90.16 per barrel in New York. Oil
and gas account for about 50 percent of Russia’s government
revenue. The ruble rallied earlier as companies bought the
currency to make monthly payments, including 275 billion rubles
($8.9 billion) in social security contributions, according to
Olga Ponomarenko, an economist at ZAO Citibank in Moscow.  “The ruble was supported by the demand for the currency to
pay social security contributions earlier in the day,”
Ponomarenko said by e-mail. “But oil has slumped which is
dragging the ruble down.”  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.5375 per
dollar in three months compared with 31.5500 on Oct. 12.  The extra yield investors demand to own  Russia ’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries fell two basis points to 183,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index
of five-year government bond yields fell eight basis points to
7.198 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
