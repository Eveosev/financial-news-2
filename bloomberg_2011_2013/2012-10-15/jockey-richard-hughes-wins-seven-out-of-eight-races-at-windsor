Irish jockey Richard Hughes won
seven of today’s eight races at the Windsor flat-race meeting
west of  London  at combined odds of more than 10,000-1.  The 39-year-old won the opening race, a six-furlong sprint,
on 13-8 joint favorite Pivotal Movement. His other wins were on
East Texas Red (5-2), Embankment (7-1), Magic Secret (4-1),
Links Drive Lady (5-2), Duke of Clarence (7-4) and Mama Quilla
(15-8). All were race favorites except Embankment.  Hughes’s only loser was Ever Fortune, a 2-1 favorite that
came third in the sixth race.  “I’m over the moon, it’s great to do it,” Hughes told
reporters. “I always said I might do it one day at Windsor, my
lucky track. Every day my kid Harvey says, ‘How many winners
today? Six or seven?’ I tell him I won’t ride that many, but I
have today.”  Hughes finished fourth in last year’s British Flat Jockeys
Championship, and today’s results all but assure him of the
title this year.  Bookmaker Ladbrokes Plc said one of its shop customers won
159,430 pounds ($256,000) with a series of multiple bets on
Hughes’s first six winners.  “It was very nearly a total wipe-out,” David Williams of
Ladbrokes said in a release. “When the smoke finally clears
we’ll probably find that we’ve done our brains.”  Irish bookmaker Paddy Power Plc estimated its payout on
Hughes’s feat at about 750,000 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
