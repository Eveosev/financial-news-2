Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four
others accused of plotting the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks
can decide not to attend court hearings, a military judge ruled
today.  “The accused can, prior to assembly, choose voluntarily
not to attend a session” provided that “he understands his
right to be present and what his actions may or may not mean,”
said Army Colonel James Pohl, the judge who is conducting
hearings in the case at the U.S. naval station in Guantanamo
Bay, Cuba.  Pohl said later that the ruling applies for the hearings
set to run for five days this week, and that he hasn’t decided
whether to review it for future sessions.  Prosecutors had filed a motion seeking to require the
attendance of defendants in all court proceedings with limited
exceptions. Defense lawyers have suggested some of the accused
may not wish to come to the hearings, without specifying what
their clients desire.  The ruling means the public may not see Mohammed and the
four other accused often in the coming weeks and months as the
case proceeds. A trial is still a year or more away.  To contact the reporter on this story:
