A proposal to allow state
participation in  Guatemala â€™s mining sector and alter 35 articles
of existing legislation was presented to Congress on Oct. 12, La
Prensa Libre said.  The proposed changes would create a state-controlled mining
fund that distributes 55 percent of the royalties earned from
mineral extraction to municipalities at or near the mining
sites, the Guatemala City-based newspaper reported. An
additional 40 percent of the royalties would be placed into a
mining fund while 5 percent would be distributed to the Energy,
Environment and Natural Resources ministries, Prensa Libre said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
