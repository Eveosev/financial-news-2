Several dozen militants attacked a
police checkpoint near  Pakistan ’s northwestern city of  Peshawar ,
killing at least six security officials.  Between 60 and 70 militants began the assault around 10:00
p.m. yesterday in Matni, south of Peshawar, senior police
official Javed Khan said. The attack went on for several hours,
Khan said.  “According to my information, six security officials were
killed in the exchange of fire, including a senior police
official,” Khan said in an interview by phone from Peshawar.
Nine policemen were also wounded in the attack, he said.  The militants set fire to the checkpoint before fleeing,

casualties. The police office in Peshawar said the dead included
policemen and paramilitary troops.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
