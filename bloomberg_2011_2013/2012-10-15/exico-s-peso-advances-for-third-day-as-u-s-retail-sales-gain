Mexico’s peso rose for a third day
as U.S. retail sales increased more than forecast, bolstering
speculation that economic growth of Mexico’s largest trade
partner is accelerating.  The currency appreciated 0.5 percent to 12.8035 per  U.S.
dollar  at 4 p.m. in Mexico City, extending its rally in 2012 to
8.8 percent, the best performance among the dollar’s 16 most-
traded counterparts tracked by Bloomberg.  “Today’s data show the U.S. is expanding at a more dynamic
pace,” said Juan Carlos Alderete, a currency strategist at
Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB in Mexico City. “This will provide
some support to the peso, but we need to be cautious as we
depend on news coming from Spain and Greece.”  The peso got a boost from speculation Spain is moving
closer to requesting a sovereign bailout, easing concern
 Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis will get worse. European Union
leaders will meet in Brussels on Oct. 18-19.  Spain ’s Economy
Minister Luis de Guindos said over the weekend in  Tokyo  that he
was “extremely comfortable” with his country’s ability to fund
itself through 2012.  U.S. retail sales advanced 1.1 percent in September, the
Commerce Department reported today. The median forecast of 77
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 0.8 percent gain.  Banorte projects the Mexican peso will advance to 12.50 per
U.S. dollar by the end of the year.  Yields on Mexico’s peso bonds due in 2024 increased two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.42 percent today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.25
centavo to 140.76 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporters on this story:
