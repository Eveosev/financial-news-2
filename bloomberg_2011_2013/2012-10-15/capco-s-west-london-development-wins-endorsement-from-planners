Capital & Counties Properties Plc (CAPC) ,
part owner of  London ’s Covent Garden Market, won planning
support for a project to build offices and more than 900 homes
in the U.K. capital.  Planners for the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea
recommended that the council approve a proposal by CapCo’s EC
Properties unit to develop a 19-acre (7.7-hectare) site at Earls
Court in West London, according to  documents  sent by the borough
to council members. The council is scheduled to vote on the
proposal, which includes demolishing the Earls Court Exhibition
Centre, on Oct. 23.  The project would create more than 10,000 square meters
(108,000 square feet) of  office space , a hotel with as many as
100 bedrooms as well as shops, pubs and restaurants. It’s part
of a larger 8 billion pound ($12.9 billion) development that won
approval last month from the Hammersmith & Fulham council.  “Sir Terry Farrell’s master plan will deliver much-needed
benefits to the local community and London, creating 7,500 new
homes and 12,000 new jobs, and we look forward to a decision in
the coming weeks,” Capital & Counties said today in an e-mailed
statement.  The project now being recommended for approval may be built
before work starts on the wider development, according to the
documents sent to council members.  To contact the reporter on this story:
