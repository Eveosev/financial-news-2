The  University of Alabama  topped
college football’s first Bowl Championship Series standings of
the season, while the Florida Gators claimed the No. 2 ranking
ahead of Oregon and Kansas State.  The Crimson Tide improved to 6-0 with a 42-10 win at the
 University of Missouri  two days ago. The defending BCS champions
have a .976 rating out of 1.000 in the standings, which are
determined using the USA Today coaches’ poll, Harris Interactive
poll and six computer rankings.  Florida, which is ranked fourth in the coaches’ poll, came
in second in the BCS after getting the highest rating from the
computer polls. The Gators (6-0) have a .909 rating while Oregon
(6-0) is at .899 and Kansas State (6-0) is .896.  Notre Dame , which also improved to 6-0 with a 20-13
overtime win against Stanford, is fifth in the BCS at .877.  Louisiana State (6-1) is sixth, followed by Oregon State
(5-0), Oklahoma (4-1) and Southern California (5-1).  The top two teams in the final BCS standings on Dec. 2 will
play in the national championship game on Jan. 7 in Miami.
Alabama and Florida don’t play each other during the regular
season, yet could meet in the Southeastern Conference title game
on Dec. 1 if both remain atop their  respective divisions .  To contact the reporter on this story:
