India ’s rupee fell for a second day
on concern a deepening slowdown in the global economy will deter
investment in the nation’s shares.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  of shares fell 0.2 percent
before a government report due around noon today in New Delhi
that is expected to show inflation accelerated last month. Bank
of Israel Governor  Stanley Fischer  said in Tokyo on Oct. 13 that
the world is “awfully close” to a recession before data due
Oct. 18 that economists predict will show  China’s economy 
expanded 7.4 percent last quarter, the slowest pace since 2009.  “Weak sentiment from global markets is weighing on the
rupee,” said Pramit Brahmbhatt, Mumbai-based chief executive
officer at Alpari Financial Services India Ltd. “ China ’s third-
quarter growth numbers are in focus.”  The rupee declined 0.4 percent to 53.0450 per dollar as of
10:10 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings
used to price options, fell 10 basis points, or 0.1 percentage
point, to 11.20 percent.  India’s  wholesale prices  rose 7.70 percent from a year
earlier, compared with a 7.55 percent gain in August, according
to the median of 35 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.
Inflation was boosted by an increase in state-set diesel prices.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards were at 53.94 a dollar,
compared with 53.77 on Oct. 12, and offshore non-deliverable
contracts were at 53.75 versus 53.56. Forwards are agreements to
buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable
contracts are settled in dollars.
