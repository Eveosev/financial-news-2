South Korea  will ask companies to
cut greenhouse gas emissions by a combined 17.2 million metric
tons next year, equivalent to a 3 percent reduction and twice as
much as this year’s target.  The guidelines assume that the 377 companies subject to
quotas would emit 570.6 million tons of carbon dioxide next year
if there is no program to curb emissions, the  Ministry  of
 Knowledge Economy  said in an e-mailed statement today. The
government has asked companies to reduce emissions by 8 million
tons this year.  Posco (005490) , Asia’s third-biggest steelmaker by output, was given
the largest reduction target at 2.48 million tons, followed by
 Hyundai Steel Co. (004020)  with 487,000 tons and Ssangyong Cement
Industrial Co. with 443,000 tons, according to the statement.
The government plans to impose fines from 2014 on companies that
fail to meet their quotas.  South Korea, the world’s eighth-largest greenhouse gas
emitter, is mapping out regulations to boost participation by
companies in curtailment efforts. The government pledged in 2009
to limit the country’s total emissions by 2020 to 30 percent
below the estimated level it would have reached with no
reduction plan.  The government also passed a bill in May to establish a
cap-and-trade program in 2015, a market-based system that
requires companies exceeding their emission quotas to buy
permits from those that discharge less.  To contact the reporter on this story:
