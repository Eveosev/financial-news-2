Petkim Petrokimya Holding AS (PETKM) ,
Turkey’s biggest petrochemicals maker, plans to invest as much
as $8 billion by 2016 on projects including a refinery, a new
port and  power plants .  The company, owned by the State Oil Co. of  Azerbaijan  or
Socar, will build two coal-fired plants with capacities of 600
megawatts and 200 megawatts, Kenan Yavuz, chief executive
officer of Socar’s Turkish unit, told reporters at the company’s
plant in Izmir, Western Turkey. The power plants will cost a
total of $1.2 billion, and help cut the company’s energy costs
by 40 percent, he said.  Petkim will start building a $400 million port in November
and complete it within two years, Yavuz said. Together with a $5
billion refinery that the company is building, the port will
help cut raw material costs by $75 million a year, he said.  Socar’s  Turkey  unit will start imports of 1.2 billion cubic
meters a year of natural gas from Azerbaijan in 2013, Yavuz
said. The company will sell as much as 500 million cubic meters
of that gas to Petkim, and the rest to other Turkish buyers, the
chief executive said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
