Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT)  said sales at its
Jaguar Land Rover unit fell 4.3 percent in September, the first
decline in 14 months, as a slowing global economy sapped demand
for  luxury vehicles .  Deliveries of Jaguar cars and Land Rover sport-utility
vehicles fell to 26,461 units last month from 27,639 a year
earlier, Tata said in a statement today. It was the first drop
since July 2011, and missed the 30,000 median estimate of 20
analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  The luxury unit, based in Gaydon, England, accounted for 72
percent of Tata Motors’ revenue in the three months ended June.
The automaker plans to invest 2 billion pounds ($3.2 billion) in
the unit this year to develop new models and expand factories to
cater to rising demand in China and  Russia  and reduce its
dependence on Europe. The 17-country euro area economy will
contract 0.4 percent this year, according to the  International
Monetary Fund .  “September is usually a good month for U.K. sales, so
these numbers are below our expectations,” said Umesh Karne, an
analyst at Brics Securities Ltd. in Mumbai. “Going forward,
sales will be under pressure until the new Range Rover
deliveries begin.”  Companies have been forced to cut costs and eliminate jobs
to weather the downturn in Europe. The euro-area  unemployment
rate  reached a record 11.4 percent in June and held at that
level through August.  Steepest Drop  Deliveries of Jaguar branded cars fell 49 percent to 2,808
units, the steepest monthly drop since Tata Motors started
reporting data in December 2009. Land Rover SUV sales increased
7 percent last month, according to the statement.  Tata Motors fell 0.7 percent to 269.40 rupees at the close
of trade in Mumbai. The shares have gained 51 percent this year,
compared with a 21 percent increase in the benchmark  Sensitive
Index. (SENSEX)   The luxury unit said Sept. 21 that it received a nod from
China’s main industry planner to form a venture with Chery
Automobile Co. and begin making cars in the world’s biggest auto
market. China’s government requires overseas automakers to work
with Chinese companies to produce domestically and avoid the
nation’s 25 percent import duty.  The Evoque, the hit model that has a special edition styled
by former Spice Girls singer  Victoria Beckham , went on sale in
September last year and accounted for more than 37 percent of
Land Rover-brand sales in the quarter ended June 30. Tata will
begin deliveries of the new Range Rover in early 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
