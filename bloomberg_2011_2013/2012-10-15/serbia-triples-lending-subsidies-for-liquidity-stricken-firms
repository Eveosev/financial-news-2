Serbia more than tripled subsidies
to more than 1 billion dinars ($11.7 million) to encourage banks
to lend to companies facing liquidity problems amid the Balkan
nation’s second recession in three years.  “Considering the great demand in the market, subsidies
have been raised through the rest of the year,” Finance
Minister  Mladjan Dinkic  told reporters in Belgrade today.  The initial subsidy amount of 300 million dinars resulted
in 353 million euros ($457.5 million) in new lending activity,
triggering a rally in the dinar, according to the ministry.  The dinar gained 1.39 percent today rising to an intraday
high of 110.3866 at 12:28 p.m. in Belgrade, its highest level in
seven months, prompting the Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije
central bank to start buying euros at just below 111 to the
euro, to slow its rally.  The dinar has gained 4 percent against the euro since the
start of October, making it the world’s top performer this month
so far.  To contact the reporter on this story:
