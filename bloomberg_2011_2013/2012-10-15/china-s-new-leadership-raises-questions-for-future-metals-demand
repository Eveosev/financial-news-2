New leadership in  China  may change
policies on infrastructure spending, raising questions about
industrial metals demand, said Ray Key, global head of metals at
Deutsche Bank AG.  China will debut its new leadership during the 18th
Communist Party Congress starting Nov. 8. The  London  Metal
Exchange index of six industrial metals including copper and
lead jumped 10 percent last month as the Asian nation approved
plans to build roads, subways, railroads, sewage-treatment
plants, ports and warehouses.  “A lot of questions remain about how much emphasis the new
leadership will put on the infrastructure build out and the
ramifications for industrial metals,” Key said in an interview
in London on Oct. 8. “We are looking at lower growth.”  China’s new team inherits an economy that grew at the
slowest pace since 2009 in the second quarter as sliding demand
from the U.S. and  Europe  curbed exports of manufactured goods.
Copper, used in homes, washing machines and power plants, has
gained 6.5 percent this year after falling 21 percent last year.  “Demand is still limited and I don’t see consumers coming
back to the point of holding large inventory,” Key said. “They
now realize it’s better not to be holding large inventories. I
think that’s a structural change.”  Copper for delivery in three months fell 0.4 percent to
$8,095.25 a metric ton by 7:18 a.m. in London.  -- With assistance from Agnieszka Troszkiewicz in London.
