Spain ’s  Agriculture Ministry  cut its
forecast for 2012 corn production as the growing area was
smaller than previously reported.  The corn harvest may climb 2.3 percent to 4.24 million
metric tons from 4.15 million tons in 2011, based on the
situation at the end of August, the ministry  reported  on its
website today. That’s below a previous outlook for a crop of
4.29 million tons.  Spain had its second-driest summer in 60 years, the
ministry’s weather service reported last month. The period from
June through to August was the fourth-warmest since 1961,
according to the report.  Wine production is estimated at 32.6 million hectoliters
(861 million gallons), the ministry wrote. That compares with an
estimated 38.6 million hectoliters last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
