Business economists cut their U.S.
growth outlook for next year to 2.4 percent as companies and
consumers restrain spending, a  survey  released today showed.  The growth estimate was lowered from 2.8 percent forecast
in May, the survey by the Washington-based National Association
for Business Economics showed. The prediction for this year was
reduced to 1.9 percent from 2.4 percent.  Economists responding to the survey “expect economic
growth to be tepid overall in 2012 and 2013, but predict growth
to slowly accelerate through 2013,” Shawn DuBravac, chief
economist at the  Consumer Electronics Association  in Arlington,
 Virginia , who analyzed the results, said in a statement.  The world’s largest economy is likely to skirt the worst
damage from the so-called fiscal cliff, the more than $600
billion of federal spending cuts and tax increases that will
automatically take effect at the start of next year unless
Congress acts, the survey showed.  While business leaders don’t see that scenario playing out,
the risk that it may is a reason they are bracing for slower
growth, said Ken Simonson, NABE president-elect for 2012-2013
and chief economist at the Associated General Contractors of
America, a trade group based in Arlington, Virginia.  “I’ve heard repeatedly from business executives saying
this uncertainty is causing us to hold back on investment,”
Simonson told reporters today at NABE’s annual meeting in  New
York . “There’s certainly worry, and just having a small chance
of a major disaster does cause people to be more cautious in
their investment and hiring.”  China, Europe  Executives also have cited threats to growth from  China ’s
cooling economy and  Europe ’s debt crisis, which both are
“hurting export prospects,” Simonson told reporters.  Consumer spending  will be restrained by weak income gains
and job growth, while the economy gets a boost from rising home
prices and construction, the survey showed.  Respondents cut their forecast for consumer spending growth
to 1.9 percent this year and 2 percent next year, it showed. The
 unemployment  rate forecast for the fourth quarter of 2012 was
raised to 8.1 percent from 8 percent.  The survey of 44 professional forecasters was conducted
Sept. 14-26, before an Oct. 5 Labor Department report showed the
jobless rate unexpectedly fell to 7.8 percent from 8.1 percent.  After-tax corporate profits are seen rising 7 percent this
year, up from a 5 percent gain predicted in May, according to
the NABE survey. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index is expected to
climb to 1,450 at the end of 2012 and to 1,520 in 2013.  Stocks Rise  The benchmark index for American equities advanced 0.5
percent to 1,435.67 as of 2:40 p.m. in New York after a
government report showed retail sales rose more than forecast in
September.  The economy expanded at a 1.3 percent pace from April
through June after growing at a 2 percent rate in the first
quarter. The median forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of 91
economists taken Oct. 5-10 predict annualized gross domestic
product growth will average 2.1 percent this year and 2 percent
next year.  The NABE survey forecasts average monthly growth in non-
farm payrolls of about 155,000 next year, down from a forecast
of 200,000 in May. The  unemployment rate  is seen ending next
year at 7.8 percent.  Investment in non-residential equipment and software is
forecast to increase 6 percent next year, down from a gain of
7.5 percent in 2012.  Housing starts will increase 13 percent to a total of
850,000 in 2013, the economists forecast. NABE, founded in 1959,
has 2,400 members.  To contact the reporter on this story:
