Finland  will need to import as much
as 1,900 megawatts of electricity, mainly from  Russia , to meet
demand next winter and after because of a shortfall in domestic
supplies, the Energy Market Authority said.  The subarctic nation’s peakload demand may reach 15,200
megawatts during cold snaps, outstripping maximum supply of
13,300 megawatts, the regulator said today in an e-mailed
 report . The country’s structural supply shortfall will grow to
as much as 2,100 megawatts by the winter of 2014-2015 as demand
continues to rise by 100 megawatts a year, it said.  “Cross-border transmission capacity of 4,650 megawatts
from Sweden,  Norway ,  Estonia  and Russia can meet the
shortfall,” provided  cables  are fully available when needed,
the regulator said. Transmission system operator Fingrid Oyj
said today in a filing to the Nord Pool Spot AS exchange in Oslo
that the 550-megawatt Fenno-Skan-1 cable that connects  Sweden 
and Finland will be out of operation until Jan. 1.  During periods when temperatures are below minus 20 degrees
Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit), each one-degree drop increases
power use by 80 to 130 megawatts, according to  statistics  on the
website of energy information service company Adato Energia Oy.  Average daily temperatures in Finland are usually below
freezing for six months a year, and for as much as seven months
in the northernmost regions, where temperatures can drop to
minus 50 degrees Celsius in late January or early February,
according to the nation’s  meteorological institute .  New generating capacity in the coming decade will help
narrow the shortfall, the Energy Market Authority said in its
report. Finland will still need to import 200 to 700 megawatts
during winter peakload even after the 1,600-megawatt Olkiluoto-3
nuclear reactor starts supplying power, currently expected in
2015. More reactors are expected online after 2020, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
