The  United Arab Emirates  set the
liability from a nuclear fallout at 450 million Special Drawing
Rights, equivalent to about 2.5 billion dirhams ($680 million)
and higher than the 300 million SDR minimum set by the Vienna
Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage.  Under the new U.A.E. federal law, signed in August, “the
operator of a nuclear facility is solely and exclusively liable
for damages arising from a nuclear incident as defined in the
1997 Vienna Convention,” the country’s Federal Authority for
Nuclear Regulation said in a statement handed to reporters in
 Abu Dhabi  today.  “The amount of liability is subject to ongoing debate,”
Hamad al-Kaabi, the U.A.E.’s permanent representative to the
 International Atomic Energy Agency , said at a press briefing.
“It makes no sense to have a high limit when the operator
cannot get insurance for that amount in the market.”  The U.A.E., the sixth-largest producer in the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries, is developing nuclear power to
meet rising electricity demand from its growing population and
diversifying industries. Four 1,400-megawatt reactors being
developed by state-owned  Emirates Nuclear Energy Corp.  are due
to start from 2017 to 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
