Egyptian doctors on a partial strike
have begun to gather resignations to ramp up pressure on the
government, which they say has neglected their demands for
better pay and an improved health-care system.  Physicians will hand in their resignations en masse when
they reach at least 15,000, said Amr El-Shora, a board member of
the strike’s general committee who quit yesterday.  Egypt  has
from 46,000 to 53,000 doctors, he said.  “We’ve been striking for 15 days now while the government
turns a blind eye to our demands,” El-Shora said in a phone
interview today. “Doctors can’t offer services to patients in
the current hospital conditions of filth, chaos and lack of
security.”  Doctors began a partial strike on Oct. 1, demanding the
enforcement of stricter security laws, higher salaries and an
increase in the state health budget to 15 percent of the total
budget from 5 percent.  Assistant Health Minister Ibrahim Mostafa said the ministry
will recommend that the physicians who quit be investigated to
determine if their resignations “obstruct work in public health
facilities and put the lives of patients at risk,” al-Masry al-
Youm newspaper reported today, citing an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
