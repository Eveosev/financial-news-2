Bentley Systems Inc. said it was
chosen by the state-controlled water utility Aguas de  Portugal 
SGPS SA to provide software technology solutions to make the
country’s water and wastewater systems more efficent.  No terms were given by Exton, Pennsylvania-based Bentley
for the deal with AdP, whose wastewater and water networks serve
80 percent of Portugal’s population. The system tools include
real-time software to forecast sewer overflows and estuary
discharges while providing energy savings, Bentley said in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
