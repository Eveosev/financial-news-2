Jonas Blixt won the Frys.com Open by
one shot over Jason Kokrak and Tim Petrovic to become the third
rookie to capture a U.S.  PGA Tour  title this season.  Blixt, a 28-year-old Swede, shot a 3-under-par 68 during
yesterday’s final round at CordeValle Golf Club in San Martin,
California, to finish with a four-round total of 16-under 268.
He received $900,000 for his first PGA Tour win, which followed
his third place at last week’s Fall Series event in  Las Vegas ,
where his final-round 70 was worst of the top eight finishers.  “You learn something every time,” Blixt said yesterday at
a news conference. “Last week I didn’t play very well in the
final round. I got a little too cute with some shots and wasn’t
aggressive enough.”  Blixt made birdies on two of the final four holes yesterday
to join John Huh and Ted Potter Jr. as rookie winners on the PGA
Tour this season.  The Fall Series next moves to  Sea Island , Georgia, for the
$4 million McGladrey Classic, which is scheduled for Oct. 18-21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
