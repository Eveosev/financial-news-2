Petroliam Nasional Bhd., the
Malaysian state oil company known as Petronas, agreed to work
with LanzaTech NZ Ltd. on a project to produce a petrochemical
from waste gases.  The companies will work on a technology to convert carbon
monoxide and carbon dioxide emitted by refineries and natural
gas wells into acetic acid, a raw material used to make polymers
and plastics, LanzaTech said in an e-mailed statement today.  Unlike carbon-capture projects which seek to trap CO2
emissions for permanent storage underground, this technology
would allow companies to earn revenue from selling acetic acid
and also comply with emission-reduction requirements, according
to the statement.  Petronasâ€™ venture unit was one of the investors in a Series
C funding round that raised $55.8 million in January for
LanzaTech. Auckland-based LanzaTech is backed by Vinod Khosla,
the venture capitalist with a net worth estimated by Forbes of
$1.4 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
