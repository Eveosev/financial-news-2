The European Union aims to approve
in the middle of next month a report on the functioning of the
bloc’s carbon market and potential long-term options to
strengthen it.  “November 14 can be confirmed as the expected adoption
date of the report,” Isaac Valero-Ladron, climate spokesman for
the European Commission, said by e-mail today.  The report, which will be sent to national governments and
other EU institutions, is a key element in the commission’s
strategy to improve the region’s emissions trading system after
prices plunged to a record low in April. Member states are
waiting for the document before taking positions on a draft EU
proposal to curb oversupply in the market by delaying some
auctions of carbon permits as of 2013.  EU carbon permits for December fell 1.4 percent to 7.74
euros ($10.04) a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange
as of 12:15 p.m. in  London . The contract extended its loss to 52
percent in the past three years as a crisis curbed industrial
output, reducing demand for pollution rights.  To contact the reporter on this story:
