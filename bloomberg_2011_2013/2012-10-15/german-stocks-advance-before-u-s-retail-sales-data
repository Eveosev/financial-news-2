German stocks  advanced, led by the
country’s two biggest banks, as U.S. retail sales rose more than
projected in September.  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  and  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  gained at least 1
percent.  SAP AG (SAP)  climbed 1.2 percent.  Douglas Holding AG (DOU)  jumped
8.1 percent as Advent International Corp., a U.S. buyout firm,
bid 1.5 billion euros ($1.9 billion) for the cosmetic retailer.
Volkswagen lost 1.5 percent.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  added 0.4 percent to 7,261.25 at the close of
trading in  Frankfurt , after earlier rising as much as 1 percent.
The DAX has rallied 22 percent from this year’s low on June 5 as
European Central Bank policy makers approved an unlimited bond-
buying program and the U.S. Federal Reserve started a third
round of asset purchases. The broader HDAX Index also gained 0.4
percent today.  Retail  sales  in the U.S. rose more than forecast in
September. The 1.1 percent gain followed a revised 1.2 percent
increase in August that was the biggest since October 2010 and
larger than previously reported, Commerce Department figures
showed today in  Washington . The  median  forecast of 77 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 0.8 percent rise.  A report from  China  showed inflation in the world’s second-
biggest economy was close to the slowest pace in two years last
month. Consumer prices rose 1.9 percent from a year earlier,
while the producer-price index fell 3.6 percent, the National
Bureau of Statistics said on its website today.  Banks Rise  Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank gained 1.4 percent to 1.50
euros and 1 percent to 32.94 euros, respectively, as a gauge of
banking stocks was the biggest riser of the 19 industry groups
in the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index. (SXXP)   SAP, the world’s largest maker of business-management
software, climbed 1.2 percent to 54.85 euros.  Douglas jumped 8.1 percent to 37.62 euros, the biggest gain
in nine months. Advent, the U.S. owner of French fashion brand
Gerard Darel, bid 38 euros a share in cash for Douglas after the
German retailer’s founding family agreed to take it private.  The buyout firm made the offer to Douglas’s shareholders
through investment vehicle Beauty Holding Three AG, according to
a regulatory statement today. The retailer’s three largest
shareholders have a binding commitment to accept the bid, and
Advent has secured 50.5 percent of Douglas’s stock, the U.S.
company said.  Volkswagen, Europe’s biggest carmaker, fell 0.8 percent to
145.45 euros.  K+S AG (SDF) ,  Europe ’s largest potash distributor, dropped 3.2
percent to 36.50 euros as Liberum Capital Ltd. cut its
