The euro is poised to climb to the
highest in a month against the dollar after it failed to break
below a key level of so-called support last week, Credit Suisse
Group AG said, citing trading patterns.  Europe ’s shared currency may strengthen toward $1.3172
after holding above its 200-day moving average of $1.2826,
technical strategists including London-based Cilline Bain wrote
in a note to clients today.  “We continue to be bullish and look for support at $1.2826
to hold firm,” the strategists wrote. “We see risk skewed
higher through $1.3011 and $1.3074 to re-test the $1.3172/78
zone,” they said.  The euro was little changed at $1.2960 at 10:19 a.m. London
time. It touched the 200-day moving average of $1.2826 on Oct.
11, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It reached $1.3172
on Sept. 17, the highest level since May 4, the data showed.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Support refers to a level where
orders to buy a security may be clustered.  Editors:  Keith Jenkins , Nicholas Reynolds  To contact the reporter on this story:
