OAO MegaFon (MFON) , Russia’s second-largest
mobile operator, said it may spend as much as $1.33 billion to
acquire as much as 50 percent of handset retailer Euroset
Holding NV.  MegaFon agreed to buy 25 percent of Euroset’s shares and
secured an option to buy another 25 percent from billionaire
 Alisher Usmanov  as soon as one year from now, the operator said
in a regulatory filing, citing a vote by its board of directors.
The combined 50 percent stake is valued at $1.33 billion, the
company said.  Euroset is Russia’s largest handset retailer. Its founder,
Yevgeny Chichvarkin, fled to London in 2008 after a criminal
investigation was opened against him and sold the company to
billionaire Alexander Mamut and mobile operator  VimpelCom (VIP)  Ltd.  In 2011, Euroset scrapped a planned London share sale.
Mamut agreed to sell 50 percent of Euroset to MegaFon and
Usmanov,  Kommersant  said last month. Usmanov will partly pay
with his stake in Internet publisher SUP Media, the newspaper
reported.  VimpelCom will continue to own about 50 percent of the
retailer. Russian operators are avoiding buying controlling
stakes in independent retailers because consolidating them in
their balance sheets would dilute profit margins, said
Konstantin Belov, an analyst at Moscow-based UralSib Capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
