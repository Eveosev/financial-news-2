A123 Systems Inc. (AONE) , the maker of
 lithium-ion batteries  for electric cars, said it may run out of
cash to fund operations and may need to seek bankruptcy
protection.  A123 expects to be in default under material debt
agreements today, the Waltham, Massachusetts-based company said
yesterday in a regulatory filing. A123 didn’t expect to be on
time with an interest payment due yesterday on $143.8 million of
notes expiring in 2016, or to make a payment due yesterday on
$2.76 million in outstanding 6 percent notes, according to the
filing.  “The company may not have sufficient cash to fund
operations and may need to seek the protections provided under
the U.S.  Bankruptcy Code ,” A123 said. “No assurance can be
given that the company will be able to avoid restructuring,
reorganization, or a bankruptcy filing.”  A123, which received a $249.1 million federal grant in 2009
to build a U.S. factory, needed a financial lifeline after
struggling with costs from a recall of batteries supplied to
Fisker Automotive Inc., the plug-in hybrid luxury carmaker. A123
announced in August that it was working on a deal with Wanxiang
Group Corp.,  China ’s largest auto-parts maker, for financing in
exchange for a majority ownership stake.  Three phone calls today to Mo Xiaoping, Wanxiang’s
spokesman, went unanswered.  Wanxiang plans to invest as much as $465 million in A123,
giving the Hangzhou, China-based company a stake of as much as
80 percent, A123 said in an Aug. 16 statement. In yesterday’s
filing, A123 said it was considering strategic alternatives
including “one or more potential transactions” to address its
liquidity problems. There is “no assurance” that A123 will be
able to find a way to continue to operate its business as a
going concern, the company said.  Political Debate  The possibility of A123 filing for  bankruptcy protection 
fuels further political debate over government financing of
alternative-energy and transportation businesses. Federal grants
and loans to companies including A123, Fisker and  Tesla Motors
Inc. (TSLA)  have drawn scrutiny from congressional Republicans
following the September 2011 bankruptcy filing of solar-panel
maker Solyndra LLC two years after it received a $535 million
loan guarantee from the U.S. Energy Department.  A123 has posted at least 14 straight quarterly losses. Its
 shares have fallen  85 percent this year to 24 cents at
yesterday’s close in  New York  and traded at 14 cents at 7:01
