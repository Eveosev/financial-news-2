Vietnamese  government bonds  fell,
pushing the five-year yield to the highest level since May, on
speculation accelerating inflation will deter policy makers from
cutting  interest rates . The dong was little changed.  The securities declined for a third day after Finance
Minister Vuong Dinh Hue said in a televised interview posted on
the government’s website last night that authorities will try to
keep consumer-price gains under 10 percent for the rest of the
year. Inflation quickened to 6.48 percent in September, the
fastest pace since June, official data show.  The “chance is low” for an interest-rate cut before year-
end, Pham Luu Hung, an analyst at Saigon Securities in Hanoi,
wrote in a research note released today.  The five-year bond yield climbed three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 10.35 percent, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That was the highest
level since May 3.  The dong traded at 20,853 per dollar as of 3:53 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,855 at the end of last week, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank set its daily
 reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to
its website. The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1
percent on either side of the fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
