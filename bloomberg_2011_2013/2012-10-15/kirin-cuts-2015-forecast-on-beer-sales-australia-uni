Kirin Holdings Co. (2503)  fell the most in
more than four months in  Tokyo  trading after cutting its 2015
sales forecast on weakening demand in Japan and slower growth at
its Australian subsidiary.  Kirin dropped 2.4 percent to close at 1,009 yen in Tokyo,
the most since June 8. Sales at Japan’s biggest brewer by market
value will reach at least 2.3 trillion yen ($29.3 billion) by
2015, lower than an earlier projection of 3 trillion yen, the
brewer said in a statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange
yesterday.  Kirin and Japanese competitors  Sapporo Holdings Ltd. (2501)  and
 Asahi Group Holdings Ltd. (2502)  are making investments overseas as
beer demand slumps at home. Industrywide beer sales in  Japan 
fell 3.7 percent to 442 million cases last year, the lowest
level since records began in 1992.  “Domestic liquor and beverage business didn’t grow as
expected and growth in  Australia ’s dairy business wasn’t
enough,” President Senji Miyake said at a press conference in
Tokyo yesterday.  Kirin in February forecast 2012 earnings below analyst
estimates amid declines in its Lion unit in Australia and in the
domestic drinks market.  Kirin projects earnings this year of A$96 million ($99
million) from the dairy and soft drink businesses at its Lion
unit, lower than the previous A$350 million target.  Earnings from Lion will miss estimates as discounting by
the nation’s biggest retailers stymies its ability to raise
prices, higher ingredient costs curb profitability and stalling
consumer demand cuts sales, the brewer said then.  Cost Reduction  Kirin plans to cut costs to improve profitability at Lion’s
soft drinks operations, the brewer said yesterday.  Operating
profit in 2015 will probably be more than 180 billion yen,
according to the company’s estimate.  The brewer bought Brazilian beer company Schincariol
Participacoes in 2011 and increased its stake in Manila-based
 San Miguel Brewery Inc. (SMB)  to 48 percent in 2009.  Kirin, which bought a 15 percent stake in Singapore-based
beverage company Fraser & Neave Ltd. in 2010 and approved
selling F&N’s stake in  Asia Pacific Breweries Ltd. (APB)  to  Heineken
NV (HEIA)  last month, is considering how to collaborate with the
conglomerate, Miyake said yesterday.  The company will continue to sell its beer through Tiger
beer maker Asia Pacific Breweries, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
