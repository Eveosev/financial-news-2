The cost of insuring Australian
corporate bonds from non-payment decreased, according to traders
of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 1 basis point to
152.5 basis points as of 11:43 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. The index declined
for a second week last week and was down about 35 basis points
this half as of Oct. 12, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  was little changed at 128 as of 8:22
a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices show.
The gauge fell 3.4 basis points last week, according to CMA,
which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was also little changed at
224 basis points as of 9:25 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG
prices show. The index rose 1.2 basis points last week and has
ranged from 136.2 basis points to 229.5 basis points this year,
according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are be22nchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
