Japanese factories cut capacity use
in August at the fastest pace since last year’s disasters,
adding to evidence that the world’s third-largest economy is
contracting.  The  capacity utilization index , the ratio of production
volume to capacity, slid 2.6 percent from the previous month to
85.8, the industry ministry said in a report released in  Tokyo 
today. That was the steepest fall since the 22 percent decline
in March 2011, when the earthquake and tsunami disrupted supply
chains.  Today’s data highlight how sagging domestic demand, the
yen’s strength and the global slowdown is hurting manufacturers,
backing forecasts by Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse Group AG
for the economy to contract in the third and fourth quarters of
this year.  “This is another sign that growth is slowing, and
reconfirms the weakness of business activity and domestic
demand,” said  Junko Nishioka , chief economist at RBS Securities
 Japan  Ltd. in Tokyo. “The corporate sector is hastily revising
down investment plans.”  Nishioka said that RBS expects the economy to shrink 0.3
percent in the third-quarter, revised down from a previous
forecast for a 0.3 percent expansion.  Japan’s industrial production fell 1.6 percent in August
from July, compared with a preliminary estimate of a 1.3 percent
drop, according to today’s report from the industry ministry.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
