Taiwan dollar  forwards halted a two-
day advance before China, the island’s largest export market,
releases data that is forecast to show growth slowed for a
seventh quarter. Government bonds were steady.  Asia’s largest economy expanded 7.4 percent in the three
months through September from a year earlier, compared with a
7.6 percent gain in the previous quarter, according to a
Bloomberg survey before a report due Oct. 18. European leaders
will meet in Brussels later this week as Greece seeks fresh aid
and Spain holds out on tapping a bailout.  “There’s caution ahead of the Chinese data,” said
Saktiandi Supaat, head of foreign-exchange research at  Malayan
Banking Bhd. (MAY)  in  Singapore . “The European Union summit may add a
little bit of volatility to  currency markets .”  One-month non-deliverable forwards traded at NT$29.165 per
dollar as of 5:44 p.m. in Taipei, compared with NT$29.170 on Oct.
12, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts
reached NT$29.133 earlier, the strongest level since May 9, and
are at a 0.6 percent premium to the spot rate.  The Taiwan dollar closed 0.1 percent stronger at NT$29.345
against its U.S. counterpart, data from Taipei Forex Inc. showed.
It was up 0.4 percent three minutes before the close of trading
and has appreciated 3.8 percent this year. The central bank has
intervened to stem advances in the currency in late trading on
most days in the past five months, according to traders who
asked not to be identified.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, rose eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 3.58 percent.  The yield on the 2 percent  government bonds  due July 2017
was 0.873 percent, compared with 0.875 percent at the end of
last week, according to Gretai Securities Market. The overnight
interbank lending rate was steady at 0.387 percent, a weighted
average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Centre shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
