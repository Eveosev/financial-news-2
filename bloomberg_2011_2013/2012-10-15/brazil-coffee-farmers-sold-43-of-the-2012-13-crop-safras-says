Coffee farmers in  Brazil , the
worldâ€™s largest producer of the bean, sold 43 percent of the
2012/13 crop, compared with 56 percent of the last crop season
by the same time last year, Safras & Mercado said.  Farmers are expecting a higher price to sell their
production, and foreign demand is still low, the agriculture
consultant said in an e-mailed report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
