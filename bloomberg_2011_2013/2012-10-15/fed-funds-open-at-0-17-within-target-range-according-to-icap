Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , opened at 0.17 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.16 percent on Oct. 12 after trading

ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-
mailed statement.  The central bank will acquire Treasuries maturing from
October 2018 to August 2020. The purchases are the part of the
Fed’s program, which lasts through the end of the year, to
replace $267 billion of short-term debt in its portfolio with
longer-term Treasuries in an effort to reduce borrowing costs.  The central bank plans to purchase from $4.25 billion to
$5.25 billion of securities today, according to the  New York 
Fed’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
