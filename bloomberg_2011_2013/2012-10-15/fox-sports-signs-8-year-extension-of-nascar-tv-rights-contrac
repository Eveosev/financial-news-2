News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Fox Sports Media Group
signed an eight-year extension of its contract to carry Nascar
racing, keeping rights to circuit events including the Daytona
500 through 2022.  Fox and Nascar didn’t reveal financial terms in a statement
today announcing the agreement. Fox will pay $300 million a
year, or $2.4 billion over the eight years, the Associated Press
said. The current pact pays $225 million, the news service said.  Fox has been cinching up long-term deals for sports,
including a new agreement with Major League Baseball for
broadcast rights extending through 2021 that pays the league
$525 million a year, people familiar with the accord said this
month.  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ESPN and ABC networks also have Nascar,
as does  Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s Turner Broadcasting.  Under the agreement, Fox Sports gains additional digital
rights to races, including live race streaming of a portion of
the season starting in 2013, the parties said  in a statement.
Financial terms weren’t announced.  Class A shares of New York-based News Corp. rose 1 percent
to $24.36 at the close in New York. They have gained 37 percent
this year.  International Speedway Corp. (ISCA) , operator of the Dayton
International Speedway, gained 3 percent to $25.66.  To contact the reporter on this story:
