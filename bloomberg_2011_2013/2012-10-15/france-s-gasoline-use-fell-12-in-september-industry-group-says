Gasoline consumption in  France 
dropped 12 percent in September from a year earlier, according
to the Union Francaise des Industries Petrolieres, an industry
group based in Paris.  Diesel demand decreased 5 percent in the period, the group,
known as UFIP, said today in an e-mailed statement.  Fuel consumption, which was stable in 2011, has been
declining since the start of 2012, Jean-Louis Schilansky, the
group’s president, said in the statement. Year-on-year
consumption had slipped in prior months because of the rise in
fuel prices, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
