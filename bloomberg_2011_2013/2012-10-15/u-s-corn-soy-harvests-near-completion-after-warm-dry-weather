Dry weather in the U.S. Midwest last
week helped farmers to bring the corn and soybean harvests
closer to completion, government data show.  The  corn  harvest was 79 percent finished as of yesterday,
up from 69 percent a week earlier and an average of 38 percent
for the previous five years, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said today in a  report . About 71 percent of the soybeans were
collected, compared with 58 percent a week earlier and 58
percent, on average, from 2007 to 2011.  “We’re closing in on the last bit of harvest here,” Greg
Grow, the director of agri-business at Archer Financial Services
Inc. in  Chicago , said by telephone. “Harvest should be finished
by the end of the month for corn.”  Corn futures for December delivery fell 2.1 percent to
$7.3725 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean futures
for November delivery dropped 2 percent to $14.925 a bushel.  The winter-wheat crop, grown in the Midwest and Great
Plains, was 71 percent planted as of yesterday. That compares
with 57 percent a week earlier and 71 percent, on average, from
2007 to 2011. The crop goes dormant over the winter until about
March, and is harvested starting in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
