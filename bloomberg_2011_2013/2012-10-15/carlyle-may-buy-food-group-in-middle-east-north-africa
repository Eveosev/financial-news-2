Carlyle Group LP (CG) , the Washington-
based buyout firm, is seeking to purchase a franchise of an
international food group in the  Middle East  and North Africa to
increase its revenue in the region.  “We’re planning a bolt-on acquisition to our food
business,” Firas Nasir, co-head of buyouts for Carlyle in the
region, told reporters on the sidelines of a conference today in
Dubai. The company is conducting due diligence, he said without
providing further details.  Carlyle bought a 42 percent stake in restaurant operator
Alamar Foods from Saudi Arabia’s Al Jammaz family in December
last year. Financial terms weren’t disclosed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
