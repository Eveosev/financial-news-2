Kyle Bennett, a member of the 2008
U.S. Olympic BMX team and a three-time world champion, died in a
single-vehicle auto accident. He was 33.  Bennett died early yesterday near his home town of Conroe,
 Texas , USA Cycling said on its  website . He wasn’t wearing a seat
belt and was traveling at high speed in a 2006 Toyota Tundra
pickup truck when it left the road and struck a culvert pipe
before hitting a wrought-iron gate and trees, eventually stopping
upside down, the Montgomery County Police Reporter said
on its  website .  “Kyle was a pioneer in Olympic BMX and an inspiration to
those of us that knew him,”  Steve Johnson , chief executive
officer of USA Cycling, said in a statement.  Bennett earned an automatic spot on the 2008 BMX biking
team as the sport made its debut at the Beijing Games. He didn’t
advance to the final round. BMX racing usually takes place on an
off-road dirt course with jumps and other obstacles.  Bennett is survived by his fiancee and a young daughter,
Kylie.  To contact the reporter on this story:
