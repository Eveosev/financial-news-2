Reduction credits dropped to the lowest level since Sept. 19 as
German power for 2013 declined to its cheapest ever, trimming
the incentive to sell electricity in forward markets.  CERs for December dropped 4.2 percent to 1.59 euros a
metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London  as of
9:26 a.m. They reached a record 1.43 euros on Sept. 18. European
Union carbon allowances for December lost 1.8 percent to 7.69
euros a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
