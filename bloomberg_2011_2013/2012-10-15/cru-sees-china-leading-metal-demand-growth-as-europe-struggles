China  will support a “healthy”
expansion in global demand for industrial metals even as
European usage fails to match pre-financial crisis levels in the
next several years, according to research company CRU.  China will consume about 45 percent of the world’s copper
by 2015 and 48 percent of all aluminum and nickel, Vanessa Davidson, group manager of copper and nickel teams at CRU, said
today in a presentation at a London Metal Exchange conference in
the U.K. city. That compares with 13 percent for copper, 12
percent for aluminum and 6 percent for nickel in 2000, according
to a copy of her presentation.  The global economic recovery will only be complete by
mid-2014 and the euro zone will remain in a recession next year
with “significant downside risk,” according to the
presentation. CRU expects  Europe  will make up 18 percent of
demand for copper in 2015, 15 percent for aluminum and 20
percent for nickel.  China’s economy  will expand 8.2 percent next year, compared
with global growth of 3.6 percent, the International Monetary
Fund estimates. The  LME Index (LMEX)  of six industrial metals slumped
23 percent since February 2011 as European leaders struggled to
contain the region’s debt crisis that prompted Greece, Ireland
and  Portugal  to receive sovereign bailouts.  While most metal markets will be in surplus in the short
term, only copper prices will remain “significantly” above
marginal production costs, according to CRU.  To contact the reporter for this story:
