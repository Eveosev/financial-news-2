The U.S. Supreme Court refused to
revive lawsuits that blamed  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and  McGraw-Hill Cos. (MHP) 
for the drop in value of employee retirement plans that invested
in company stock.  The justices today let stand federal appeals court rulings
that threw out separate worker lawsuits against the two New
York-based companies. The appeals court said the companies
didn’t breach their duties as plan sponsors by offering the
stock in the months before their share prices plunged.  The Citigroup suit was filed on behalf of 150,000 employees
covered by two retirement plans. They said the company should
have done more to protect them from the fallout from Citigroup’s
exposure to the subprime mortgage market.  Citigroup stock fell from $55.70 to $28.74 during the
period at issue in the case, from Jan. 1, 2007, to Jan. 15,
2008. It fell to a record low $1.02 in March 2009.  The McGraw-Hill employees said that the company’s stock was
too risky for retirement accounts in 2007 and 2008 and that the
company should have known its shares were likely to fall over
allegations its  Standard & Poor’s  unit gave improperly high
ratings to mortgage-backed securities.  Both suits were filed under the federal Employee Retirement
Income Security Act.  The cases are Gray v. Citigroup, 11-1531, and Gearren v.
McGraw-Hill, 11-1550.  To contact the reporter on this story:
