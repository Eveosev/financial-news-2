Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO) , the U.S. oil and
natural gas producer that spun off its refining business last
year, is seeking to sell more than 96,000 net acres in the Eagle
Ford formation in  Texas .  The sale includes acreage in nine tracts in Karnes, Bee and
Wilson counties, according to a  listing  on the Oil & Gas Asset
Clearinghouse website. An electronic data room for the sale of
96,738 net acres opened Oct. 1 and bids are due by Oct. 25, a
marketing  flyer  shows.  The Eagle Ford remains a “priority” for the company,
Chief Operating Officer  David Roberts  said in prepared  remarks 
for a conference in  San Antonio  today. The company sees net
Eagle Ford production rising to about 120,000 barrels of oil
equivalent a day by 2016, he said. Marathon has said it plans
$1.5 billion to $3 billion of asset sales for 2011 through the
end of 2013.  “The marketing effort is part of our normal efforts to
high-grade our acreage and focus on the core,”  Lee Warren , a
spokeswoman for Houston-based Marathon, said in an e-mail today.
“The acreage being marketed is not part of the approximately
200,000 net acres within our holdings that we consider the core
of the play.”  Marathon’s strategy and production goals for the Eagle Ford
are unchanged, Warren said.  The company plans to spend about $1.6 billion there
annually over the next five years, Roberts said. Marathon has
about 325,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford. Daily gross output is
approaching the equivalent of 100,000 barrels of oil, compared
with 29,000 barrels last Nov. 1, he said.  Marathon rose 1.7 percent to $29.87 at the close in  New
York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
