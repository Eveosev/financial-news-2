September was the warmest on record
going back to 1880, the Arctic had its least amount of sea ice
and the Antarctic had the most, according to the U.S.  National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .  The global average temperature for September was 60.21
degrees Fahrenheit (15.67 Celsius), tying 2005 as the warmest on
record, according to NOAA. It was also the 35th September and
the 331st consecutive month that recorded temperatures above the
20th century average.  “The last below-average September temperature was
September 1976, and the last below-average temperature for any
month was February 1985,” according to the NOAA report.  The high temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere have
contributed to widespread drought across the U.S. and eastern
 Europe , where Hungary is experiencing its worst dry period in 20
years. Corn and soybean prices have risen, taking food prices
with them, because of the parched conditions. Traffic on the
 Mississippi River  was also slowed when water levels in shipping
channels fell.  The Arctic sea ice also shrank to 1.39 million square
miles, or 49 percent below the 1979-2000 average, which was also
the lowest monthly mark in the 34-year record.  “More than 4.57 million square miles of ice melted in
2012, the size of the entire  United States  and  Mexico 
combined,” the report showed. “The largest annual sea ice loss
on record for the Arctic.”  In Antarctica, where September marks the transition from
winter to spring, the average sea ice extent for the month was
7.49 million square miles breaking the previous mark set in
September 2006, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
