The U.S. has the world’s highest
incarceration rate, with  Department of Justice  data showing more
than 2.2 million people are behind bars, equal to a city the
size of Houston.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows that, with a rate of 730 people
per 100,000, the U.S. jails a higher proportion of its citizens
than any other country, according to data from the International
Centre for Prison Studies, an independent research center
associated with  England ’s University of Essex.  “The model is, if you build it they will come,” said
Daniel D’Amico, a professor of economics at Loyola University
New Orleans. “Because we have all these prisons and all of
these other resources funneled into our criminal justice system,
we have this ability to enforce things that would otherwise be
unenforceable.”  “That includes the drug war, but it’s also including
everything from the Martha Stewart types to immigration
policies,” D’Amico said. “The scope of things that are now
criminal in corporate law is exponentially higher than it was
merely twenty years ago.”  The U.S. also leads the world in the number of prisons in
operation at 4,575, more than four times the number of second-
place  Russia  at 1,029. U.S. states spent $52 billion to
construct and operate those prisons in 2011, more than quadruple
the $12 billion spent in 1987, according to data from the Pew
Center on the States.  To contact the reporters on this story:
