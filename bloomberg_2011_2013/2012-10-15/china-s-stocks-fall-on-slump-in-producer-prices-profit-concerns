China’s stocks  fell to the lowest
level in a week after a report showed producer prices declined
the most since 2009 and companies from  ZTE (000063)  Corp. and  Yunnan
Copper Industry Co. (000878)  estimated third-quarter losses.  ZTE, China’s second-biggest phone-equipment maker, plunged
10 percent and Yunnan Copper, the nation’s fourth-biggest
producer of the metal, retreated 2.4 percent. Chinese producer
prices dropped 3.6 percent last month, accelerating from a 3.5
percent decline in the previous month. Concerns about deflation
and lending overshadowed reports showing China’s exports and
money supply rose more than estimated in September.  “Forthcoming third-quarter earnings will be a major factor
weighing on the market and the numbers aren’t great,” said Wu Kan, a  fund manager  at Dazhong Insurance Co. in  Shanghai , which
oversees $285 million. “The weak PPI number casts a question
mark over the economic recovery. There’s no rationale for
aggressive buying.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell 0.3 percent to 2,098.70
at the close. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  slid 0.4 percent to 2,294.86.
The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies
traded in Hong Kong added 0.4 percent. The  Bloomberg China-US 55
Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded Chinese companies in the U.S. rose 0.1
percent in  New York  on Oct. 12.  Even with today’s loss, the Shanghai Composite has
rebounded 4.7 percent since reaching a three-year low on Sept.
26 on expectations regulators will introduce measures to
stabilize the market ahead of a once-in-a-decade power
transition of the Communist Party in November. The gauge is
valued at 9.8 times estimated earnings, compared with the 17.9
average since Bloomberg began compiling the weekly  data  in 2006.  ‘Slack Demand’  The decline in producer prices exceeded the median estimate
of a 3.5 percent drop in Bloomberg survey of 31 economists.
Consumer prices rose 1.9 percent last month, close to the
slowest pace in two years, the statistics bureau said today.  “Inflation data continues to point to slack demand, with
industrial prices contracting at a rapid pace,” Alistair Thornton, an economist with IHS Global Insight in Beijing, wrote
in a report.  Chinese banks extended 623.2 billion  yuan  ($99.5 billion)
of local-currency loans in September, the People’s Bank of China
said on its website on Oct. 12 after the market closed. That
compares with the median estimate of 700 billion yuan in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists.  “Credit supply in September was below expectations, mainly
a reflection of the People’s Bank of China’s cautious approach
towards policy loosening,”  Yu Song  and Yin Zhang, economists at
Beijing Gao Hua Securities Co., said in a report.  Earnings Concerns  ZTE tumbled by the daily limit of 10 percent to 9.45 yuan.
The company said it may post a third-quarter loss of as much as
2 billion yuan after delays in some overseas projects and
collective purchasing by local carriers.  Yunnan Copper fell 2.4 percent to 16.13 yuan after
estimating a third-quarter loss of 307.8 million yuan.  Yunnan Aluminium Co. (000807) , China’s fifth-largest producer of the
light metal, lost 2.1 percent to 5.09 yuan. The company said its
third-quarter loss may be between 4 million yuan and 5.5 million
yuan.  China’s exports increased 9.9 percent from a year earlier
in September, the customs administration said Oct. 13 in
Beijing. That was more than the 5.5 percent median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists. M2  money supply  gained 14.8
percent, the fastest pace since June 2011, a central bank report
showed the same day.  The  economy  probably expanded 7.4 percent in the three
months ended Sept. 30, the slowest pace in more than three
years, according to the median estimate of 37 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. The GDP report and September data for industrial
production, fixed-asset investment and retail sales are due on
Oct. 18.  Consumer Staples  A gauge of consumer staples stocks in the CSI 300 rose 0.8
percent, the second-biggest gain among the 10 industry groups.  Wuliangye Yibin Co. (000858) , the nation’s second-biggest maker of
baijiu liquor, surged 3.9 percent to 34.67 yuan. The company
expects third-quarter net income to rise by as much as 90
percent and net income for the first nine months to rise by as
much as 62 percent, according to an exchange statement.  Kweichow Moutai Co. (600519) , China’s biggest producer of baijiu
liquor by market value, added 0.9 percent to 245.71 yuan. Luzhou
Laojiao Co., a sprits producer in the province of Sichuan,
climbed 3 percent to 39.50 yuan.  Thirty-day  volatility  in the Shanghai Composite was at 19.9
today, compared with this year’s average of 17.1. About 5.3
billion shares changed hands in the gauge, 31 percent lower than
the daily average in 2012.  Chinese companies traded on the mainland are priced at the
smallest premium to Hong Kong-listed counterparts in eight
months. Yuan-denominated A shares in Shanghai and Shenzhen are
only 1 percent more expensive than their dual-listed
counterparts in  Hong Kong , according to an index from Hang Seng
Bank Ltd. That premium is the narrowest since Feb. 17 and
compares with 23 percent a year ago.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Chan Tien Hin  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
