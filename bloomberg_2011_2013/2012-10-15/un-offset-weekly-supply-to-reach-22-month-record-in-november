Weekly supply of United Nations
carbon offsets is due to reach the most in 22 months in the week
ending Nov. 9, according to UN data, as supply of European Union
permits is set to rise.  The executive board of the UN’s Clean Development
Mechanism, the body responsible for regulating Certified
Emissions reductions, or CERs, is scheduled to deliver 19
million metric tons of credits that week, according to UN data
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the biggest weekly volume since
Jan. 21, 2011, and the third-largest on record, the data show.  Supply of UN offsets rose to 1 billion tons on Sept. 7.
Total issuance in October is set to climb to 28 million tons,
the seventh-highest month on record, while supply slated to flow
between Nov. 1 and Nov. 11 has reached 23 million tons.  Germany , the U.K. and the EU on behalf of 25 other member
states will begin to sell permits from a 120 million ton reserve
on Oct. 26. The EU’s emissions trading system will be 1.6
billion tons oversupplied by the end of 2012 and the glut won’t
disappear until 2016, according to  Trevor Sikorski , an analyst
at Barclays Plc in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
