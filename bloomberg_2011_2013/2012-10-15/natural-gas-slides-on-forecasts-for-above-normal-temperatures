Natural gas futures dropped for the
first time in six days on forecasts of warmer-than-normal
weather that would reduce consumption of the heating fuel.  Gas declined 3.5 percent after forecasters including MDA
EarthSat Weather predicted normal or above-normal temperatures
across most of the lower 48 states through Oct. 24. Heating
demand may be 28 percent below normal from Oct. 21 through Oct.
25, according to Weather Derivatives in Belton,  Missouri .  “Without early heating-season demand, the market is
starting to balance out,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and
broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The
buyers are bailing out.”  Natural gas for November delivery fell 12.5 cents to settle
at $3.486 per million British thermal units on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. The futures are down 5.9 percent from a
year ago. Gas rose to $3.611 per million Btu on Oct. 12, the
highest settlement price since Dec. 1.  November $3.80 calls, bets that prices will rise, were the
most active gas options in electronic trading. They were 2.5
cents lower at 1.3 cents on volume of 564 contracts as of 1:59
p.m. Calls accounted for 59 percent of options volume.  The low in New York on Oct. 24 may be 45 degrees Fahrenheit
(7 Celsius), 3 below normal, according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in
State College,  Pennsylvania . About 50 percent of U.S. households
use gas for heating, Energy Department data show.  Mild September  September tied for being the warmest in records going back
to 1880, according to the U.S.  National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration . The global average temperature for September was
60.21 degrees Fahrenheit (15.67 Celsius), tying 2005 as the
warmest on record, NOAA said in a report today.  The winter of 2012-13 may be the second consecutive winter
to produce below-normal heating demand, while failing to reach
the high temperatures of the 2011-2012 season, MDA EarthSat
predicted in an Oct. 2 outlook.  The winter, measured by meteorologists as running from
December through February, will probably have temperatures
higher than the 10- and 30-year normal ranges, according to  MDA 
in Gaithersburg,  Maryland . The result may be that below-normal
amounts of natural gas, heating oil and electricity will be
needed to warm homes and businesses, MDA said.  The boom in oil and natural gas production helped the U.S.
cut its reliance on imported fuel. America met 83 percent of its
energy needs in the first six months of the year, Energy
Department data show. If the trend goes on through 2012, it will
be the highest level of self-sufficiency since 1991.  Production Record  U.S. natural gas production in 2012 will average a record
68.85 billion cubic feet a day, up 4 percent from last year, the
department said, the department said Oct. 10 in its monthly
Short-Term Energy Outlook. Inventories may climb to a record
3.903 trillion cubic feet by Oct. 31.  The number of rigs drilling for natural gas in the U.S.
fell by 15 to 422 last week, the lowest level since June 1999,
according to data released Oct. 12 by Baker Hughes Inc. in
Houston. The rig count is down 48 percent this year.  Hedge funds raised bullish bets on natural gas to the
highest level since August as a shrinking U.S. supply glut,
slowing production growth and increasing power-plant demand
pushed futures to a 10-month high.  The U.S. may become a net exporter of natural gas by the
end of this decade, earlier than the government’s 2022 estimate,
as producers extract more gas from shale, the head of the Energy
Information Administration said. Administrator Adam Sieminski
made the comments today at an U.S. Chamber of Commerce event in
 Washington .  CFTC Report  Money managers boosted net-long positions, or wagers on
rising prices, by 9.5 percent to 151,942 in the week ended Oct.
9, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s
Commitments of Traders report on Oct. 12. They were the most
since the seven days ended Aug. 14.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
314,122 as of 2:49 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 394,000. Volume was 383,309 on Oct. 12. Open interest was
1.19 million contracts. The three-month average is 1.11 million.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting full
volume and open interest data.  ----With assistance from Asjylyn Loder in New York, Brian K. Sullivan in  Boston  and Brian Wingfield in Washington. Editors:
