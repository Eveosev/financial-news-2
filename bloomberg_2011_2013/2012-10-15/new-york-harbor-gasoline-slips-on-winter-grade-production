East Coast gasoline weakened the
most in almost two weeks as refiners produced winter-grade fuel
that may boost fuel supplies and plants completed repairs.  The switch to winter-grade gasoline, which has a higher
vapor pressure and can be made from cheaper, more readily
available components than summer fuel, may add to stockpiles
that grew 1 million barrels to 21.4 million in the Central
Atlantic region the week ended Oct. 5, the Energy Department
reported.  Delta Air Lines Inc.â€™s Monroe Energy LLC subsidiary
increased rates at its 185,000-barrel-a-day Trainer refinery in
 Pennsylvania , contributing to supplies in the  New York  Harbor.
The refinery was closed in September 2011.  The  premium  for reformulated 87-octane gasoline on the East
Coast dropped 6 cents to 11 cents a barrel over futures on the
New York Mercantile Exchange at 2:06 p.m., the biggest decline
since Oct. 2.  Prompt delivery  slid 8.68 cents to $2.976 a
gallon.  Crude inputs on the East Coast increased by 214,000 barrels
to 1.09 million Oct. 5, the highest level since Dec. 9, the
Energy Department reported. The premium for conventional 87-
octane gasoline in the New York Harbor slid 3 cents to 17.5
cents a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
