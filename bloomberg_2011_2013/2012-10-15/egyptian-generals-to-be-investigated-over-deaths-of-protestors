An Egyptian court has ordered an
investigation into allegations that former heads of the military
were involved in the killing of protestors in last yearâ€™s
uprising that ousted former President  Hosni Mubarak .  The Cairo Court of Appeals appointed Judge Hamad Tharwat to
open the investigation of the former head of the army, Field
Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, former chief of staff, Sami
Anan, and the former head of the military police, Hamdi Badeen,
the court said in a faxed statement today.  Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi ordered the retirement of
Tantawi and Anan in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
