Serbia ’s central bank bought euros
for the first time since May 2011 to curb gains in the dinar.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije purchased 5 million
euros ($6.47 million) today to “smooth the dinar’s intraday
swings,” the bank said on its website without giving any
further details.  Three currency traders in Belgrade who asked to remain
unidentified, in line with the policies of their banks, said the
central bank was buying euros at just below 111 dinars to the
euro. The currency traded at 110.7517 to the euro at 5:15 p.m.
in Belgrade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The dinar has strengthened because of tight monetary
policy, changes to reserve-requirement rules, carefully
allocated liquidity and an increased offer of foreign currencies
as banks sell euros to approve subsidized loans, the central
bank said in a statement.  “With its measures and precise allocation of dinar and
foreign-currency liquidity, it is the duty of the National Bank
of Serbia to discourage the longer-term creation of excess
liquidity, which allows speculative play in the foreign-exchange
market,” the bank said.  The dinar rose 1.39 percent to an intraday high of 110.3866
at 12:28 p.m. in Belgrade, its strongest in seven months. It has
gained 4 percent against the euro this month, making it the
world’s top performer in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
