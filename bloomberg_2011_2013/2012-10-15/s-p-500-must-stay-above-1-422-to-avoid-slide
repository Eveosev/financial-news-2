The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  must
close this week above a level it crossed in September for the
first time in four years to avoid further declines, according to
a technical analyst at Aurel-BGC.  Investors can only expect an extension of the 12 percent
rally since its June 1 low if the gauge breaks out of the
current trading range and crosses new resistance lines within
the next two weeks, said Gerard Sagnier of Aurel in Paris.  Last week’s 2.2 percent drop brought the gauge little more
than six points above 1,422, which the S&P 500 fell below in May
2008 and couldn’t cross on a closing basis until Sept. 6 this
year, data compiled by Bloomberg showed. Sagnier considers this
level a support for the  S&P 500 , a point that limits losses on
the measure and a breach of which signals a downtrend.  “What was a resistance level has become a support,” he
said in a telephone interview. “If it falls through that level,
it’s not good. It can even lead European markets lower. As we’re
expecting a lot of earnings reports, it’s a good time to see if
the market holds up.”  Some 84 companies in the S&P 500 release results this
week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The next resistance levels for the benchmark measure are
1,435 and then 1,455, he said. Sagnier said he remains neutral
on U.S. stocks until the index leaves its current trading range.  U.S. stocks last week had the biggest retreat since June as
the  International Monetary Fund  reduced its global growth
forecasts and projections from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and
Alcoa Inc. disappointed investors.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
