Profit margins of steelmakers in
China may shrink as a demand recovery falters and  iron ore 
prices gain, a Mirae Asset Securities (HK) Ltd. analyst said.  Reinforcement bar  prices in the local market may remain at
3,700  yuan  to 3,800 yuan a metric ton in the near future, while
iron ore and coking coal prices will continue to rise, Mirae’s
Shirley Zhao said by phone from  Hong Kong . The profit margin on
the bars is now about 200 yuan ($32) a ton, compared with a loss
last month, she said.  “Steel is lacking an upward momentum as there aren’t any
signs of a strong recovery and traders are still having
difficulty borrowing money to expand stocks,” Zhao said, citing
discussions with the traders. “Iron ore prices may keep rising
until they are unaffordable.”  Spot prices of steel rebars, used in buildings, have risen
12 percent to 3,806 yuan since Sept. 7, when  China  announced
plans for higher infrastructure spending, according to
researcher Beijing Antaike Information Development Co. China’s
economy probably grew 7.4 percent in the third quarter from a
year earlier, the weakest expansion since the first quarter of
2009, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  Ore with 62 percent content delivered to the Chinese port
of Tianjin has gained 29 percent to $114.50 a dry ton since Sept.
7, according to a gauge compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  China is scheduled to report gross domestic product, fixed-
asset investment, retail sales and industrial output on Oct. 18.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
