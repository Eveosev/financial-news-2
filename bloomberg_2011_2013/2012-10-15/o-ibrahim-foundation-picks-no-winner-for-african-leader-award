The Mo Ibrahim Foundation chose no
winner for its $5 million African Leadership Award for the third
time in six years because there were no suitable candidates,
selection committee chairman Salim Ahmed Salim said.  The award is supposed to be given out annually to a
democratically elected African leader who helped improve the
quality of life in his or her country and then handed over power
peacefully. Past winners include former South African President
 Nelson Mandela  and Festus Mogae, who was president of Botswana.  Governance in some of the continent’s largest economies
including Egypt, Nigeria,  South Africa  and Kenya is “stuttering
a bit,” Ibrahim, the Sudanese-born billionaire founder of the
telecommunications company Celtel International BV, told
reporters today at same event in London. Indicators are
improving across the continent in the Ibrahim Index of African
Governance, including  gender equality , economic development,
access to health care and rural productivity, Ibrahim said in a
live broadcast streamed over the Internet.  Between 2000 and last year, there has been “a marked
improvement in governance across  Africa ,” he said. “The
economy has been moving forward relentlessly. However, economic
development does not give us a reason to be a little complacent
about participation and the human rights of people.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
