Ethanol futures declined for a
second day, dropping with corn after the U.S. government said
demand for the grain is slowing.  The biofuel fell 1.9 percent, the most in almost a month.
The Agriculture Department  reported  Oct. 12 that in the week
ended Oct. 7, exporters sold 4,232 metric tons of corn for
delivery before Aug. 31, down from 1.26 million a year earlier,
The U.S. is the world’s leading grower and exporter of corn.  “Anybody on the buy side is going to be pretty cautious
right now,” said Will Babler, a broker at Atten Babler Risk
Management LLC in Galena,  Illinois . “From a real short run
perspective, it’s just falling through on corn.”  Denatured ethanol for November delivery sank 4.7 cents, or
1.9 percent, to $2.383 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.
The price has risen 8.2 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol fell 5 cents to $2.485 a
gallon in  New York , 1.5 cents to $2.43 in Chicago, 2 cents to
$2.485 on the  Gulf Coast  and 3 cents to $2.585 on the West
Coast.  Corn for December delivery declined 15.5 cents to $7.3725 a
bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of
ethanol.  Crude oil for November delivery slid 1 cent to $91.85 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Gasoline for November delivery fell 4.25 cents to $2.8503 a
gallon on the Nymex. The contract covers reformulated gasoline,
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
