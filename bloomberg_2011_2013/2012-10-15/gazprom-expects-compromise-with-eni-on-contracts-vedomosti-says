OAO Gazprom (OGZD)  expects to find a
solution should  Eni SpA (ENI)  demand revision of the take-or-pay rule
in its gas supply contracts, Vedomosti reported today, citing an
unidentified official at the Russian gas exporter.  Eni hasn’t formally requested the change, the daily said
after Eni Chief Executive Officer  Paolo Scaroni  questioned the
rule that forces gas buyers to take volumes set by the contract
or pay for them. Scaroni said Eni could “not renew take or pay
contracts and try to rework the ones that are still in force,”
La Repubblica reported.  Gazprom Export, a unit of Moscow-based Gazprom, declined to
comment on Scaroni’s remarks today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
