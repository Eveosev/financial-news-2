Pilots of the Antonov AN-28 plane
that crashed on Sept. 12 in the Russian  Far East  were drunk,
investigators said.  The probe found ethanol in the pilots’ blood, a government
committee investigating the crash said on its website today. The
concentration of ethanol in the captain’s blood was equivalent
to a “low level of inebriation” while his assistant had a
“medium level of inebriation,” according to the statement.  Ten people, including a child and the pilots, died when the
propeller-driven AN-28 crashed in Kamchatka during a passenger
flight operated by a local company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
