Superior Plus Corp. (SPB) , the largest
propane distributor in  Canada , gained the most in two months
after an analyst upgraded the stock on the view the company’s
two main divisions will rise in value.  Superior Plus rose 5.6 percent to C$9.42 at the close in
Toronto. Earlier, the Calgary-based company gained as much as
6.5 percent, the biggest intraday increase since Aug. 3. It has
surged 63 percent this year, making it the best-performing  stock 
in the Standard & Poor’s/TSX Industrials Index.  Jason Granger, equity analyst at BMO Capital Markets,
raised his 12-month target to C$11 per share from C$9 on Aug.9.  “We have become more comfortable with the scale of
opportunities,” from the company’s earnings improvement plans,
Granger said in a note to clients. The previously
“underperforming” Canadian propane and construction products
divisions are expected to increase in value by at least 20
percent in the next two to three years.  Granger cited Chief Executive Officer Luc Desjardins, hired
in 2011, as a positive influence, as well as the company’s move
to pay down its debt by reducing its dividend, improving its
working capital management and introducing initiatives to
improve efficiency.  Desjardins “is highly regarded, has a strong operational
focus and track record in business restructuring,” Granger
said.  Superior will make an estimated C$301 million in Ebitda in
2014, Granger said in the note, an increase of an expected C$272
million in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
