China ’s consumer prices rose 1.9
percent in September from a year earlier while the producer-
 price index  dropped 3.6 percent, the National Bureau of
Statistics said today.  Inflation compares with the 1.9 percent median estimate in
a Bloomberg News survey of 34 analysts and a 2 percent gain in
August. Analysts forecast a 3.5 percent decline in producer
prices.   Gains in consumer prices have moderated from a three-year
high of 6.5 percent in July 2011 as food and fuel costs eased.
People’s Bank of China Deputy Governor Yi Gang said yesterday
that while this year’s inflation rate is “fine” and may be 2.7
percent for the full year, longer-term threats are from
agricultural costs and prices for imported raw materials,
commodities and energy, which can be driven up by global
monetary easing.  Premier  Wen Jiabao  pledged in March to hold consumer-price
increases to about 4 percent this year. The inflation rate has
been below that target for eight months. Producer prices
declined for the seventh straight month.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
