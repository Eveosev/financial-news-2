Russia’s middle class will double to
60 percent of the population by 2050, benefiting hotels and
restaurants, according to a  report  by  HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA)   By that time, about 74 million Russians will earn between
$3,000 and $15,000 a year, making them part of the middle class,
according to an HSBC report received by e-mail today. That
compares with 42 million, or 30 percent of the population last
year, when 14 million people made less than $1,000, it said. By
2050, 49 million people will earn more than $15,000, according
to the London-based lender.  President  Vladimir Putin , who returned to the Kremlin for a
six-year term in May, wants to boost the size of the middle
class to as much as 70 percent of the population, while reducing
the country’s income gap. Russian real-income growth will be
among the highest in emerging markets, according to HSBC. That
will contribute to 6 percent annual growth in spending on hotels
and restaurants through 2050, it said.  “Beyond Asia’s giants, Brazil and Russia will add the
largest number of middle-class earners by 2030, but Egypt, the
Philippines and Indonesia will pull ahead by 2050,” HSBC
economists  Karen Ward , based in London and Frederic Neumann,
based in  Hong Kong , wrote in today’s report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
