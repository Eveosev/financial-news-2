Dry weather this week in  Brazil ’s
sugar-cane growing areas will help harvesting, the consultant
Somar Meteorologia said today in an e-mailed report.  Winds and heavy rain may interfere with farmers’ efforts to
plant soy and corn in southern Brazil, and lighter rains in the
west may help them plant the crops, Somar said in a separate
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
