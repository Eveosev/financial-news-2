Petroliam Nasional Bhd. ,  Malaysia ’s
state oil company, raised a price-adjustment factor for its
flagship Tapis crude for the first time in four months as the
profit from making diesel increases.  Petronas, as the Kuala Lumpur-based company is known, set
the so-called  alpha  at $3.50 a barrel for October, an official
said today, asking not to be identified because of internal
rules. It was $3.05 for September and  averaged  $5.90 last year.  Refiners’ gains from producing gasoil, or diesel, has
rebounded following a 9.3 percent drop last month, boosting
demand for low-sulfur, or “sweet” crude, such as those pumped
in Malaysia.  Gasoil’s premium  to Asian marker Dubai crude was at
$19.07 a barrel today, according to data from PVM Oil Associates
Ltd., a broker. This crack spread was $18.87 at the end of
September.  Petronas includes the Tapis adjustment factor in its
monthly calculations of official selling prices. The formula is
tied to Brent produced in the  North Sea , a benchmark grade for
 Europe , the Mediterranean and  Africa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
