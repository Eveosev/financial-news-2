Serbia  and  Pakistan  are considering
defense cooperation, including possible export of ammunition,
armored vehicles and assault rifles to the Asian country.  Serbia has been trying since 2009 to arrange such sales and
an agreement may be reached after a visit by Pakistani Defense
Minister Syed Naveed Qamar to several defense producers in the
Balkan country, Serbia’s Defense Minister Aleksandar Vucic told
reporters in Belgrade today after meeting with Qamar.  The Balkan country, which is going through its second
recession in three years, is looking for new markets for its
arms industry. Serbia’s arms exports fell by at least a fifth
last year to less than $200 million as sales to Libya stopped
after the uprising that ousted longtime leader  Muammar Qaddafi .  Serbia has eight state-owned military plants including
rifle maker Zastava Oruzje AD and aircraft producer Utva, which
sell mostly to countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and also to the
U.S.  Qamar said Pakistan may also consider a free trade
agreement with Serbia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
