Japanese  stocks  rose, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rebounding from near its lowest level
since July, as China reported the slowest inflation rate in two
years and better-than-estimated exports.  TDK Corp. (6762) , a manufacturer of electronic parts which gets 27
percent of its revenue from China, climbed 3.3 percent.
 Bridgestone Corp. (5108)  paced tire makers higher after rubber prices
declined. Renesas Electronics Corp., the world’s largest micro-
controller maker, jumped 14 percent after people familiar with
the matter said it may be acquired.  Softbank Corp. (9984)  sank 5.3
percent as the mobile-phone company nears an agreement to buy 70
percent of Sprint Nextel Corp.  The Nikkei 225 climbed 0.5 percent to 8,577.93 at the 3
p.m. close in  Tokyo , after dropping as much as 0.5 percent, with
twice as many stocks rising as falling. Volume on the gauge was
about equal with the 30-day average. The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index
gained 0.7 percent to 722.99, with almost two rising for each
that gained.  “Investors are relatively pleased with China’s export
growth,” said  Junichi Misawa , head of equity investment at
Sumitomo　Mitsui Trust Management Co. in Tokyo, which oversees
about　$44 billion. “Many Japanese companies related to China
were sold too much on temporary political troubles.”  The Topix has declined 4.7 percent since Sept. 18, when
protests in response to a territorial dispute escalated in
mainland China, forcing Fast Retailing Co. and other Japanese
retailers in China to shut their stores. The benchmark Nikkei
225 fell last week as the  International Monetary Fund  cut its
forecast for global economic growth.  Relative Value  The price of shares on Japan’s broadest equity measure
stood at 0.9 times book value, compared with 2.2 times for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5 times for the Europe Stoxx
600 Index. A number less than one means that companies can be
bought for less than the value of their assets.  China ’s exports and money supply grew more than estimated
in September, signaling the world’s second-biggest economy may
be stabilizing after a slowdown that began in the first quarter
of 2011. Consumer prices rose 1.9 percent in September from a
year earlier, close to the slowest pace in two years, and
producer prices fell the most since 2009.  TDK gained 3.3 percent to 2,941 yen. Murata Manufacturing
Co., an electronic-parts maker that depends on China and Taiwan
for half of its sales, climbed 2.9 percent to 3,915 yen.  Japanese stocks declined earlier today amid concern global
growth is slowing as a solution to Europe’s debt crisis eludes
finance chiefs. European leaders meet this week as Greece seeks
to justify renewed aid and  Spain  holds out on tapping a bailout.  Europe Drags  “While Europe still bears problems, the  U.S. economy  is
solid and high growth in Asian countries is offsetting the
market,” said  Kiyoshi Ishigane , a Tokyo-based strategist at
Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co. which oversees about $70
billion. “The European situation continues to drag down the
global economy. Even China’s improved trade data was negative
toward the European Union area.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The gauge fell 0.3 percent on Oct. 12 even after
confidence among U.S. consumers unexpectedly jumped in October
to the highest level since before the recession began five years
ago.  Bridgestone Corp. and other tiremakers gained the most
among the Topix’s 33 industry groups after rubber prices for
March delivery contract today fell by as much as 3.2 percent to
the lowest level since Sept. 27. Bridgestone climbed 3.4 percent
to 1,788 yen. Yokohama Rubber Ltd. gained 3 percent to 546 yen.  Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723)  surged 14 percent to 302 yen
after two people familiar with the matter said it may be
acquired for 200 billion yen ($2.5 billion).  Softbank declined the most in the Nikkei 225, falling 5.3
percent to 2,268 yen after three people familiar with the matter
said the company is near an agreement to buy a 70 percent stake
in Sprint for $20 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
