Shipping cocoa beans grown in  Ghana ,
the world’s second-largest producer, to the U.K. will cost 8.3
percent more in the current crop season, according to a unit of
the board that oversees the industry.  The charge to haul Ghanaian beans to the English ports of
Tilbury and Felixstowe and to Dublin rose 3 pounds to 39 pounds
($62) a metric ton for the 2012-13 season begun Oct. 1, a
document from Accra, Ghana-based Cocoa Marketing Co. e-mailed
today showed. Dutch, Belgian and German cargoes will gain 10
percent to 53 euros ($68) a ton from 48 euros last season.  The chocolate ingredient is normally hauled at sea in 20-
foot steel containers by shipping companies including
Copenhagen-based A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S, owner of the world’s
largest container line. Freight rates from Ghana, where the
cocoa market is state-controlled, are negotiated annually
between shippers and Cocoa Marketing Co.  Carrying Ghanaian beans to the Spanish port of Barcelona
and Trieste in  Italy  will cost 60 euros a ton, up from 55 euros
last season, according to the document. Shipping rates rose to
$100 a ton for  Japan  and $95 a ton for both Korea and  Singapore ,
increasing by $8 in each case.  Ghana’s cocoa harvest may fall 11 percent to 800,000 tons
in the current season amid concern about adverse weather, Noah
Amenyah, a spokesman for the Ghana Cocoa Board, said Sept. 12.
Cocoa Marketing Co. is a unit of the board, its website shows.  The cost of shipping products such as cocoa butter to the
U.K. and Dublin rose 3 pounds to 43 pounds a ton, according to
the document. Cocoa butter accounts for as much as 20 percent of
the weight of a chocolate bar, according to Commodities Risk
Analysis LC, a cocoa-research company based in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
