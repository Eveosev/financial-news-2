Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. (YGE) ,
China’s third-largest solar-panel maker, shipped 40 megawatts of
equipment to a pair of power projects in southern Peru as the
company seeks to gain share in  Latin America .  The two 20-megawatt projects, in the Tacna and Moqueua
regions, are expected to begin producing electricity this year,
Baoding, China-based Yingli said today in a statement. Spain’s
Corp. Gestamp Solar SL and Solarpack Corp. Tecnologica are
jointly developing the solar farms.  Yingli has opened units in Mexico, Chile and Brazil in an
effort to beat Chinese rivals in Latin America, where
governments are making efforts to promote solar power, Fernando
Calisalvo, managing director for Yingli’s Spain unit, said today
in a telephone interview.  “We are seeing competition directly from other Chinese
manufacturers in Latin America,” he said. “I have seen
manufacturers able to supply in those countries but have not
seen competitors as well-positioned as Yingli.”  Yingli generated 98.6 percent of its revenue in Europe, the
U.S. and China last year, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg.  Suntech Power Holdings Co. was China’s largest panel maker
by capacity last year according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance,
