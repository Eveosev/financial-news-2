Columbia University reported a 2.3
percent return on its endowment investments in fiscal 2012,
topping results at Harvard University and Stanford University.  Columbia’s endowment value as of June 30 was $7.65 billion,
the university said today in an e-mailed statement. That’s down
from $7.8 billion a year earlier because withdrawals to fund
operations were made at a rate that exceeded the investment
return, Brian Connolly, a Columbia spokesman, said in an e-mail.  Endowments and foundations had the worst returns of any
class of institutional investor in the year through June,
gaining 0.37 percent, consulting firm Wilshire Associates said
in an Aug. 6 report. Harvard, the world’s richest school with an
endowment of $30.7 billion, reported a 0.05 percent loss on its
investments, while Stanford posted a gain of 1 percent.  Yale University, the second-wealthiest school, produced a
4.7 percent return, the most so far this year among the eight
Ivy League colleges in the northeastern U.S. Over 10 years, Yale
had an annual return of 10.6 percent, topping Columbia’s 10.4
percent performance.  In fiscal 2011 and 2010, Columbia was the Ivy League’s top
performer, with returns of 24 percent and 17 percent,
respectively. Those gains came after a 16 percent loss in fiscal
2009, in the wake of the global financial crisis.  Princeton University, Cornell University and Dartmouth
College have yet to release their results.  To contact the reporter on this story:
