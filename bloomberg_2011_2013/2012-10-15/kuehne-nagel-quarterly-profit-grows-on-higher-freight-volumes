Kuehne & Nagel International AG (KNIN) , the
world’s biggest sea-freight forwarder, said third-quarter profit
rose 2.8 percent as sea and air freight volumes increased.  Earnings before interest and taxes climbed to 181 million
Swiss francs ($193 million) from 176 million francs a year
earlier, the Schindellegi, Switzerland-based company said in an
e-mailed statement. The average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg was 186 million francs.  Sea freight rates between Hong Kong and  Los Angeles  have
increased 82 percent from the third quarter of 2011, according
to research from Drewry Shipping Consultants Ltd. Kuehne & Nagel
cut its sea freight growth forecast to between 6 percent and 8
percent on Sept. 19, from an earlier target of 8 percent.  Kuehne & Nagel is “confident of reaching the profitability
targets we have set ourselves for the full business year 2012,”
Chief Executive Officer Reinhard Lange said in the statement.  Sales increased 12 percent to 5.4 billion francs.  Competitor  Panalpina Welttransport Holding AG (PWTN)  said Oct. 12
third quarter profit would miss analyst estimates, citing higher
costs and air freight volumes that were 8 percent lower than the
previous year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
