Greek government bonds rose, pushing
10-year yields to the lowest level since the nation’s debt was
restructured in March, after German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said a Greek default “will not happen.”  Germany ’s bonds declined before a report tomorrow that
economists said will show  investor confidence  improved this
month, damping demand for  Europe ’s safest securities.  Spain ’s
securities fell as the nation held off requesting a bailout
before European Union leaders gather for a summit in Brussels on
Oct. 18-19.  France  auctioned 7 billion euros ($9.06 billion) of
bills today and the Netherlands sold 2.1 billion euros of 106-
and 194-day securities.  “Most important are the comments Schaeuble made over the
weekend, basically ruling out a sovereign default for Greece and
dismissing any speculation Greece will exit the euro area,”
said Norbert Aul, a rates strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in
 London . “This is a pretty clear commitment by the German
finance minister so should be the key reason for the performance
of Greek yields today.”  The  yield  on  Greece ’s 10-year bond fell 47 basis points, or
0.47 percentage point, to 17.58 percent at 4:36 p.m. London time
after dropping as low as 17.38 percent. The 2 percent security
due in February 2023 climbed 1.01, or 10.1 euros per 1,000-euro
face amount, to 31.435.  ‘Serious Reforms’  “It will not happen that there will be a ‘Staatsbankrott’
in Greece,” Schaeuble said at a forum in  Singapore  yesterday.
“Greece has had to take a lot of very serious reforms” and an
increasing majority of the population “does understand that
being a member of the common European currency is in the best
interest of Greece,” he said.  German  investor confidence  climbed to minus 14.9 this month
from minus 18.2 in September, according to the median forecast
of 36 economists in a Bloomberg News survey before tomorrow’s
report from the ZEW Center for European Economic Research.  The 10-year bund yield rose three basis points to 1.48
percent. The nation’s two-year note yields added one basis point
to 0.05 percent.  “German 10-year yields remain very much stuck in the range
we’ve been trading for the past couple of weeks with 1.40
percent to the downside and 1.60 percent to the upside,” said
 Michael Leister , a fixed-income strategist at Commerzbank AG in
London. “We expect them to stay in this range until the
summit” of EU leaders this week.  Leister said he expected the yield to rise to 1.70 percent
by year-end.  Spain Efforts  Spanish bonds slumped, with the 10-year yield climbing 19
basis points to 5.82 percent. The nation is set to sell 4.5
billion euros of securities maturing in 2015, 2016 and 2022 on
Oct. 18, after it auctions a similar amount of bills tomorrow.  Financial markets have yet to appreciate the efforts made
by Spain’s government to return to sustainable public finances,
Schaeuble also said yesterday.  The nation’s 10-year yield fell six basis points last week
amid speculation the country will seek financial assistance,
which is needed before the  European Central Bank  can step in to
buy its bonds.  Spain wants there to be consensus among European
governments on any bailout request before deciding whether to
ask for help, Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria
said on Oct. 11.  “It behooves the Spanish and their partners to take each
step very carefully given what’s at stake, but what the market’s
convinced of is that at some point you do have that backstop”
from the ECB,  Luca Jellinek , head of European interest-rate
strategy at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in
London, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “The
Pulse” with  Guy Johnson .  Italian Bonds  Italy plans to sell inflation-linked bonds due October 2016
this week. The debt will be issued with a minimum coupon of 2.55
percent, according to a person familiar with the offering, who
asked not to be identified because terms aren’t set.  Italian bonds were little changed, with the 10-year yield
at 4.98 percent.  France auctioned three-month bills at a record-low average
yield of minus 0.023 percent, compared with minus 0.018 percent
on Oct. 8. The nation also sold debt due in 154 and 364 days.  German bonds returned 3.4 percent this year through Oct.
12, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish securities
advanced 4.3 percent, while Italian debt rose 16 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
