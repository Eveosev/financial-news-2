(Corrects spelling of European Union President’s name in
headline and first paragraph.)   Luxembourg Finance Minister Luc
Frieden said  Europe  needs to pursue greater fiscal, economic and
financial integration, and proposals by European Union President
 Herman Van Rompuy  to consider the pooling of national bill sales
and setting up a euro-zone budget with its own borrowing powers
are in-line with these objectives.  “These are long-term objectives that I support, but they
are no answer to short-term problems that Europe has to face,”
Frieden told reporters in Mexico City today. “In the short-
term, we need to do intelligent fiscal consolidation. Once we
have that, further steps should be envisaged.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
