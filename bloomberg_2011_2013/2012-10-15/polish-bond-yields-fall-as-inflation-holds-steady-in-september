Polish bond yields fell after a
report showed the inflation rate held steady in September,
defying economist expectations for an increase.  The yield on notes maturing in July 2014 declined three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.98 percent by 5:10
p.m. in Warsaw, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
zloty pared its gain of as much as 0.4 percent, trading 0.2
percent stronger at 4.0919 per euro.  Inflation remained at 3.8 percent, the statistics office
said today. The figure was below the 4 percent median estimate
in a Bloomberg survey of 34 economists. The report justifies a
rate cut in November, Elzbieta Chojna-Duch, a member of the
central bank’s Monetary Policy Council, told TVN CNBC in an
interview.  “The data has sealed the rate cut in November,” Ernest
Pytlarczyk, chief economist at BRE Bank SA in Warsaw, wrote in
an e-mailed comment. “The following readings should confirm an
easing cycle is under way.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
