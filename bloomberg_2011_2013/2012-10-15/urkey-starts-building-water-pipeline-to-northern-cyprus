Turkey  started construction on a
pipeline under the Mediterranean Sea to supply fresh water to
northern Cyprus, a Turkish journal said today without citing
anyone.  Deputy Prime Minister Besir Atalay and Irsen Kucuk, prime
minister of the breakaway Turkish Cypriot republic, attended the
ground-breaking ceremony in the province of Mersin on Oct. 13,
said the Journal of Turkish Weekly, published online by the
Ankara-based International Strategic Research Organization.  The 107-kilometer (67-mile) pipeline will run from Alakopru
dam near Anamur on the Mediterranean to a dam that will be built
in Gecitkoy in northern Cyprus. It’s expected to be operational
by March 2014, the Turkish Weekly said.  When done, the pipeline could also supply water to the
southern Greek Cypriot side should the island be unified, the
Turkish government has said. The line is designed to carry 75
million cubic meters (19.8 billion gallons) of water a year to
northern Cyprus. Cyprus has been divided between the Republic of
Cyprus and Turkish-held northern part since 1974.  Turkey also plans to provide electricity to northern Cyprus
through underwater cables that will run parallel to the water
pipeline. “We intend to complete the electricity-transmission
project at about the same time as the water project,” the
Turkish Weekly quoted Atalay as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
