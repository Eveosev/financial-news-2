Cincinnati Reds manager  Dusty Baker 
signed a two-year contract extension, returning after a season
that included a division title and a hospital stay.  The extension will keep Baker with the Reds through the
2014 Major League Baseball season, the team said in a news
release on its  website . The contract came after Baker completed
his 19th year as a major league manager, equaling the length of
his playing career.  Baker, 63, was admitted to a Chicago hospital for treatment
of an irregular heartbeat on Sept. 19. The team clinched a
playoff spot the following day and took the National League
Central Division title two days later. On Sept. 21, Baker had a
mini-stroke as he was being discharged from the hospital.  After missing 11 games, Baker returned for the team’s final
series and playoffs. The Reds were eliminated in five games by
the  San Francisco Giants  after taking a 2-0 division-series lead
with consecutive road wins.  Baker is 419-391 in five seasons with the Reds, who went
97-65 this year to finish nine games ahead of the  St. Louis
Cardinals  in the NL Central. As a manager with the Reds, Giants
and Chicago Cubs,  Baker is 1,581-1,432 , winning five division
titles and an NL pennant with the Giants in 2002. He’s been
voted the NL’s Manager of the Year three times by the Baseball
Writers’ Association of America.  To contact the reporter on this story:
