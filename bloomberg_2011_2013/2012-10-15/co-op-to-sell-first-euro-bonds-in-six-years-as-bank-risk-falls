Co-Operative Bank Plc, the 140-year-
old U.K. mutual lender, is selling its first bonds in euros in
almost six years as the cost of insuring financial institutions’
debt fell to the lowest in 15 months.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of credit-default swaps
linked to the senior debt of 25 banks and insurers fell two
basis points to 176 at 4 p.m. in  London , the lowest since July
2011. Bonds of Societe Anonyme de Gestion de Stocksde Securite,
or Sagess, fell as the French refiner sold its first euro bonds
since January.  Co-Op, which agreed to buy 632 branches from Lloyds Banking
Group Plc in July, is considering selling senior unsecured bonds
as companies rush to take advantage of a five-month rally fueled
by the  European Central Bank ’s plans to fix the debt crisis.
German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said yesterday a
Greek default “will not happen” as European Union leaders
prepare for a summit in Brussels on Oct. 18-19.  “It’s been a risk-on environment for some time,” said
 Elisabeth Afseth , an analyst at Investec Bank Plc in London.
“I’m slightly cautious as to whether it can continue.”  Bank of America Merrill Lynch EUR Corporates, Banking index
shows investors demand 163 basis points more than the benchmark
swap rate to buy financial bonds, the lowest since July 2011.
The premium compares with 333 basis points at the end of last
year, the data show.  New Bonds  The Co-Op last sold euro-denominated securities in January
2007 when it raised 25 million euros ($32 million) from
floating-rate notes due 2014, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. BNP Paribas SA, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Natixis and UBS
AG will manage the sale of the new bonds, said a banker, who
asked not to be named before the transaction is completed.  The Manchester, England-based lender issued bonds in
November when it raised 600 million pounds ($963 million) from
4.75 percent covered bonds due 2021. The notes trade at 116.7
pence on the pound, up from their 99.21 pence issue price, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  “We are looking to diversify our funding,” said Gary McDermott, a manager at Co-Op’s capital markets desk. He
confirmed it is the first time since 2007 it seeks to raise cash
in the euro market in the senior unsecured market though it sold
mortgage-backed securities in the currency last year, he said.  Sagess sold 700 million euros of seven-year bonds to yield
50 basis points more than the swap rate. The spread on the
refiner’s 4 percent notes due 2024 widened to 84 basis points
from a two-week low of 82 on Oct. 12.  Corporate Debt  The cost of insuring European corporate debt fell,
signaling improvement in perceptions of  credit quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped six
basis points to 535. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125
companies with investment-grade ratings was unchanged at 127
basis points.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
