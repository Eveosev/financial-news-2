Firehiwot Dado, the women’s champion
at the 2011  New York City Marathon , will miss this year’s race
because of a foot injury.  Dado, an Ethiopian who beat countrywoman Buzunesh Deba by
four seconds to win last year’s race in 2 hours, 23 minutes, 15
seconds, withdrew from the Nov. 4 event because she has been
unable to train after a blister on her foot became infected, New
York Road Runners, which organizes the race, said in a statement
citing Dado’s manager, Hussein Makke.  “Given the level of swelling on her ankle and the open
nature of the blister itself, she has stopped training for some
time now,” Makke said.  Dado, 28, hasn’t competed since June, when she finished
fifth in the NYRR  New York  Mini 10K. She made her NYC Marathon
debut last year, joining Deba in catching  Kenya ’s Mary Keitany
in the 24th mile before holding off Deba for the victory. Deba
is scheduled to participate in this year’s race.  To contact the reporter on this story:
