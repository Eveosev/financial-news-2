Kristin Gilbertson, the University
of Pennsylvania’s chief investment officer, resigned after
managing one of the largest U.S. college endowments for eight
years, the Ivy League school said today.  Gilbertson will serve as a special adviser through the end
of the year while the Philadelphia-based university begins a
search for her replacement, according to a memo from Craig Carnaroli, Penn’s executive vice president. David Harkins, the
endowment’s managing director of public markets, will serve as
interim chief investment officer, according to a copy of the
memo sent to  Bloomberg News  by Stephen MacCarthy, a university
spokesman.  “Kristin has worked tirelessly on behalf of Penn and we
are enormously grateful for her talents and contributions,”
Carnaroli said. “Performance of the endowment has improved
steadily under her leadership.”  Penn had the 11th largest university endowment in  North
America  as of June 30, 2011, according to a study by the
National Association of College and University Business Officers
and the Commonfund Institute released earlier this year. The
value of the fund stood at $6.8 billion at the end of June, a
1.6 percent return for the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
