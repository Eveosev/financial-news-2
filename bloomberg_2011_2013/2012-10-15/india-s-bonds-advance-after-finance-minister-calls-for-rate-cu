India’s 10-year  bonds  were little
changed, with yields holding at at two-week high, on concern
accelerating inflation will keep the central bank from easing
the monetary policy.  The wholesale-price  index  rose to a 10-month high of 7.81
percent from a year earlier, after climbing 7.55 percent in
August, the trade ministry said in  New Delhi  today. The median
of 35 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was 7.7 percent. The
central bank will review its policy on Oct. 30.  “A risk-averse central bank is not expected to let its
guard on inflation risks immediately,”  Indranil Pan , chief
economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank in Mumbai, said in a note.
“The headline inflation is unlikely to lead the RBI to start
reducing rates this month.”  The yield on the benchmark 8.15 percent notes due June 2022
was little changed at 8.17 percent in Mumbai, according to the
central bank’s trading system. The rate is the highest level
since Sept. 26.  The  Reserve Bank  of India has kept the repurchase  rate  at 8
percent since reducing it by 50 basis points in April.  Earlier, the 10-year bonds advanced after Finance Minister
Palaniappan Chidambaram said lower  interest rates  are needed to
bolster economic growth.  Asia’s third largest economy  grew  5.5 percent in the three
months through June, government data show, after expansion of
5.3 percent in the previous quarter, the least since 2009.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, was little
changed at 7.63 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
