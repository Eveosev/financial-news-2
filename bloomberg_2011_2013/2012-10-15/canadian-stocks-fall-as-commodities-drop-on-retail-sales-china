Canadian stocks  climbed, with the
 Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  advancing in the last half
hour of trading, as a rally in financial shares overshadowed a
slump in commodities and a rise in  household debt  to a record.  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) , Canada’s largest insurer,
advanced 1.5 percent.  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , the nation’s largest
lender, and  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)  rose at least 0.5 percent.
Argonaut Gold Inc. plunged 7.9 percent after agreeing to buy
 Prodigy Gold Inc. (PDG)  for C$320.3 million ($327.6 million).
 Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. (TRQ)  retreated 5.1 percent after the
company rejected demands from the Mongolian government to
renegotiate a mining deal.  The S&P/TSX rose 27.92 points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,229.96
in Toronto, erasing earlier losses of as much as 0.5 percent.
The benchmark equity gauge slumped 1.8 percent last week for the
biggest drop since June 1.  “There’s a lot of cash on the sidelines and people are
skittish. You need some impetus to buy,”  Irwin Michael ,  fund
manager  with ABC Funds, said in an interview from Toronto. His
firm manages about C$800 million. “It’s to be expected debt
will go up in tougher economic times, but we can’t get
mesmerized by all the data.”  Canadian household debt compared with disposable income
jumped to a  record  165.8 percent in the second quarter,
 Statistics Canada  said, heightening concerns borrowing will
weigh on the country’s economic outlook.  The first-quarter figure was also revised to 164.2 percent
from a previous 154.3 percent. Today’s report made historical
revisions back to 1990, which raised the debt ratio in recent
years due to a higher estimate of credit-market debt and reduced
income.  Manulife Rises  Manulife added 1.5 percent to C$12.03. Royal Bank rose 0.7
percent to C$57.24 and TD Bank gained 0.5 percent to C$81.45.
Financial stocks  contributed  most to gains on the benchmark
Canadian equity gauge as nine of 10 industries advanced on
trading 25 percent lower than the 30-day average.  Raw materials stocks had the only decline among groups in
the S&P/TSX, falling 0.2 percent. Gold for December delivery
fell the most in three months, slipping 1.3 percent to settle at
$1,737.60 an ounce in New York as reports showed U.S. retail
sales increased last month more than forecast and inflation
slowed in China.  Argonaut Gold (AR)  tumbled 7.9 percent to C$9.65, its biggest
loss since May 2011, after announcing a deal to buy Vancouver-
based Prodigy Gold and its Magino gold project in northern
Ontario. Prodigy Gold soared 42 percent to 98 cents, its highest
level in almost four years.  Turquoise Hill  Turquoise Hill Resources retreated 5.1 percent to C$8.12
after the company, along with its partner  Rio Tinto  Group, said
they rejected a request by Mongolia to renegotiate a 2009 deal
over the $6.2 billion Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine.  London-based Rio Tinto owns 51 percent of Turquoise Hill,
formerly Ivanhoe Mines Ltd.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s largest gold producer,
slipped 0.8 percent to C$37.99 and  Detour Gold Corp. (DGC)  retreated
4.1 percent to C$26.60.  Crude for November delivery fell 1 cent to settle at $91.85
a barrel in New York. Oil last week posted its first weekly gain
in a month as increasing Middle East tension prompted concern
that supplies may be disrupted.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) , the nation’s third-largest
oil company by market value, lost 0.5 percent to C$30.10 and
 Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM)  declined 0.6 percent to C$12.70.  To contact the reporters on this story:
