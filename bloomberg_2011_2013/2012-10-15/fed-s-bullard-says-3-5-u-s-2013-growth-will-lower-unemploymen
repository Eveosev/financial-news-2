Federal Reserve Bank of  St. Louis 
President  James Bullard  said U.S. economic growth will likely
pick up to 3.5 percent next year, pushing the  unemployment rate 
to close to 7 percent.  Gross domestic product will increase close to 2 percent
this year before accelerating, Bullard said in a speech in St.
Louis, whose presentation slides were released with no
commentary or text. The unemployment rate in 2012 will be about
8 percent, Bullard said, citing St. Louis Fed estimates.
Personal consumption expenditures inflation will be 2 percent
this year and next, in line with the central bank’s target, he
said.  The regional Fed bank president last week said he was still
weighing what position to advocate at next week’s  Federal Open
Market Committee  meeting, in which Fed officials will consider
whether to make adjustments to its purchases of $40 billion of
mortgage debt a month in a third round of quantitative easing.  Recent economic data have been largely better than
expected, with  retail sales  rising 1.1 percent in September,
Commerce Department figures showed today. That followed
improvements in housing, consumer confidence and the
 unemployment rat e. The Fed’s Beige Book report on regional
conditions last week  said the U.S. economy was expanding
“modestly” last month, supported by improvements in housing
and auto sales, even as the labor market showed little change.  To contact the reporters on this story:
