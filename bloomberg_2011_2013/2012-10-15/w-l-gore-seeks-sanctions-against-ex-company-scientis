W.L. Gore & Associates Inc., the
maker of waterproof Gore-Tex fabric, asked a judge to punish one
of its former top scientists, claiming he’s using company
secrets to start his own business in violation of a court order.  Huey Shen Wu was ordered in 2006, following a lawsuit in
 Delaware  Chancery Court, to refrain from developing any products
for sale related to polymers he worked on while he was with
Gore, the company said in a complaint filed today in Wilmington,
Delaware. Wu has established companies in Taiwan and China that
will use  trade secrets  he learned while at Gore, the complaint
alleges.  Wu “has told Chinese television reporters that the
anticipated annual revenue of this enterprise will be
approximately $95 million,” according to the court filing in
Chancery Court.  The dispute involves the use of one of Gore’s signature
products, material made from polymers known as PTFE. Gore makes
military clothing designed to protect troops against chemical
and biological weapons. Wu is planning to compete with Gore
through various companies he is affiliated with, including
Perfect Defense Technology, according to court papers.  Wu and other officials of Perfect Defense didn’t
immediately reply to an e-mailed message seeking comment on the
allegations.  Closely held Gore is based in based in  Newark , Delaware.
The company was founded by a former  DuPont Co. (DD)  scientist.  The case is W.L. Gore & Associates Inc. v. Huey Shen Wu,
7946, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
