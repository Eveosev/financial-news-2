Egypt ’s government has drafted a law
to combat “political thuggery,” in what it describes as an
attempt to “protect the revolution and the society” from
criminals and achieve security and stability, state-run Ahram
newspaper reported today.  The draft law criminalizes causing damage to buildings,
historical monuments and other public property, disrupting
traffic and transportation, obstructing work at public interest
facilities, and violation of the freedom to work, Ahram said.  The law aims at countering “anti-revolutionary elements
attempting to use criminals to achieve their own political
interests,” the Cairo-based paper said.  Blocking roads and striking have been widely used recently
in Egypt as a form of protest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
