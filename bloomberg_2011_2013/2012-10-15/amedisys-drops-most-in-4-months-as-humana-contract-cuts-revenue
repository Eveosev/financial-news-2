Amedisys Inc. (AMED) , the biggest U.S.
home-nursing provider, fell the most in five months after saying
a contract with  Humana Inc. (HUM)  will provide half as much revenue as
a previous deal.  Amedisys tumbled 9.4 percent to $12.08 at the close in  New
York , for its biggest one-day decline since May 9. The agreement
to provide home health-care services to Humana will generate
about half the $65 million to $70 million of the prior contract
and affect earnings starting with the current quarter,  Baton
Rouge , Louisiana-based Amedisys said today in a statement.  While the companies had said they were renegotiating the
contract, the terms are worse than expected, said Brian Tanquilut, a Jefferies & Co. analyst in  Los Angeles . The old
contract represented about 5 percent of Amedisys’s annual sales,
he said. Amedisys also said it may not serve as many markets for
Humana under the new agreement.  “We anticipated Humana reimbursement to fall by about 33
percent and had thought that our projection was one of the more
bearish ones,” Tanquilut wrote in a note to clients. “Our
analysis suggests that Amedisys’ contract with Humana is barely
 profitable  since Amedisys has little wiggle room in its direct
costs,” such as nurses’ wages and mileage reimbursements.  Amedisys, which also provides hospice services, is the
biggest home-care company by market value. Humana, the second-
biggest seller of insurance for the government’s Medicare
program, is based in Louisville,  Kentucky .  To contact the reporter on this story:
