More than 30 percent of Egyptians
over 15 years old are drug users, and the problem has reached
crisis levels, Al-Ahram reported, citing a report by the
parliamentâ€™s upper house.  The Shura Council Health Committee report, discussed
yesterday, said that 7 percent of drug users in that age group
were in Cairo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
