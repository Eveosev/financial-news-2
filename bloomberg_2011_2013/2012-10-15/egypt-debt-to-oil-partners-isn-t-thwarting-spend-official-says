Egypt  continues to attract
investment from overseas oil companies operating in the North
African nation even if they are owed payments by the nation’s
government, according to Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Co.  The state-run gas company’s debts to overseas partners
“aren’t that high,” Chairman Mohamed Shoeib said today in a
telephone interview from Cairo, declining to be more specific.  Egyptian state-owned oil companies “have a mechanism for
payments that we agreed upon with the foreign partners in such a
way that does not prevent them from pumping new investments in
Egypt,” he said.  Dana Petroleum Plc is owed tens of millions of dollars,
Nick Dancer, the company’s managing director and manager for
Egypt, said on Sept. 11.  The nation’s oil and gas exploration tender issued by Egas
in May guarantees terms and conditions that prevent the
accumulation of debt on state companies because foreign
companies will have the right to sell the gas in local and
international markets, according to Shoeib.  State-owned Egyptian General Petroleum Corp. made payments
of $9 billion due to its foreign partners in the fiscal year
that ended on June 30, the Al Ahram website cited Chairman Hani
Dahi as saying on Sept. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
