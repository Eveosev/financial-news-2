Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , Canada’s
second-largest bank by assets, will use software based on  TD
Ameritrade Holding Corp.’s (AMTD)  platform to allow its Canadian
brokerage clients to trade U.S. stocks and options.  The web-based program will allow TD Waterhouse Discount
Brokerage customers to filter and execute options strategies and
provides analysis of trades, the Toronto-based bank said today
in an e-mailed statement.  “Our suite of U.S. trading platforms is in direct response
to growing demand among retail investors who want sophisticated
tools to execute their strategies,” TD Waterhouse President
Kerry Peacock said in the statement.  Toronto-Dominion is the largest investor in Omaha,
Nebraska-based TD Ameritrade with about a 45 percent stake,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
