Gabon plans to spend 7.15 trillion
 CFA francs  ($14.1 billion) on roads, railways, ports and
airports by 2016, the government said today.  “Three trillion CFA francs will be invested in the
construction of new roads around the country, where only 900
kilometers (559 miles) of roads existed in 2009,” Henri Ohayon,
director general of the National Agency for Major Works, said
from a statement.  The agency, known as ANGT, is working with the government
to approve a master plan for national infrastructure and to
develop appropriate sustainable projects that can be implemented
with the available budget, Ohayon added.  “We want international companies to invest in Gabon,” the
official said.  A 300-kilometer railway line will connect the city of Booué
to Belinga in the northeast where iron mines will be operated,
Ohayon told reporters in Libreville.  ANGT is working with Bechtel Group Inc. to provide
procedures, oversight and technical expertise to staff, the
government said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
