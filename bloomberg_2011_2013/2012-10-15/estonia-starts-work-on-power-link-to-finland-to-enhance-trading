Construction began in  Estonia  today
on a 650-megawatt  power link  that will almost triple
transmission capacity between the Nordic and Baltic regions by
early 2014 and help ensure congestion-free power trading.  Installation of the 320 million-euro ($415 million)
Estlink-2 high-voltage direct current cable started on the
Estonian coast and will commence in  Finland  as early as next
month, followed by final testing and commissioning in 2013, grid
operators in the two countries said today.  “The Estlink-2 HVDC connection is built so as to improve
power system security and electricity market integration in the
Baltic Sea region,” Fingrid Oyj of Finland and Estonia’s
Elering AS said in a joint e-mailed statement.  The Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and  Lithuania  are
now connected with the Nordic region via a 350-megawatt cable
that has been congested for 41 percent of this year, according
to  Fingrid . The nations’ links with power networks and markets
in neighboring countries will be further enhanced in 2015 by the
500-megawatt  LitPol  interconnector from Lithuania to Poland and
the 700-megawatt  NordBalt  cable from  Sweden  to Lithuania.  To contact the reporter on this story:
