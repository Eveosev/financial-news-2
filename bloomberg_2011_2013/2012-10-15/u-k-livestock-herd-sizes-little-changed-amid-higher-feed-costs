U.K. livestock herds were little
changed compared with last year, while high feed costs may
encourage some farmers to shrink output later in the year, the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said.  The cattle herd, including beef and dairy animals, totaled
9.902 million head as of June 1, down 0.3 percent from 9.933
million at the same time last year, Defra said today in a  report 
on its website. Pig supplies rose to 4.483 million head, up 0.9
percent from 4.441 million head a year earlier.  The price of feed wheat has climbed 29 percent this year on
NYSE Liffe in London as the wettest U.K. summer in a century cut
harvests to a five-year low. Corn on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the global benchmark, is up 15 percent after drought hurt crops
in the U.S., the biggest grower and exporter. The U.K. National
Pig Association has warned that slaughter may fall as much as 10
percent in the second half of next year as farmers’ costs climb.  “Recent high feed and input costs may start to impact on
returns and some destocking is expected, which may have more
impact later in 2012,” Defra said in the report today, citing
pork output.  The U.K.’s supply of beef breeding cattle, an indication of
future supplies, totaled 1.657 million head, down 1.1 percent
from 1.675 million a year earlier, according to the report. The
dairy breeding herd was 1.812 million animals, down 0.1 percent
from 1.814 million head. Breeding pig supplies were pegged at
523,000 animals, unchanged from last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
