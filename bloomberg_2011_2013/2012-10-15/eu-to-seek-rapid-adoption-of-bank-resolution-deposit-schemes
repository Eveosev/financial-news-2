European Union leaders may call at a
summit his week for “rapid adoption” of common rules for
handling failing  banks  and compensating their depositors as part
of a push to build a single rulebook for lenders.  Negotiations on the draft rules, including measures to set
up “national funds” for dealing with banks in crisis, should
be concluded before the end of 2012, according to draft
conclusions that leaders will discuss in Brussels Oct. 18-19.  The document, obtained by  Bloomberg News , also calls for
work on establishing a single supervisor for banks in the 17-
nation euro area to be taken forward “as a matter of priority,
with the objective of completing it by the end of this year.”  Euro-area efforts to pave the way for direct bailouts of
banks by its firewall fund have foundered because of concerns
that plans to build a single euro-area bank supervisor, based
around the  European Central Bank , would hurt nations outside the
common currency. All 27 EU nations must approve the oversight
proposal for it to move forward.  “It is important to ensure a level playing field” between
nations that sign up for the supervision plan and those that
don’t, the draft conclusions say.  “The ECB should be able to use the effective powers
conferred on it by the legislation as soon as it comes into
force, subject to appropriate operational phasing-in
arrangements,” according to the draft conclusions, prepared by
EU President  Herman Van Rompuy .  To contact the reporter on this story:
