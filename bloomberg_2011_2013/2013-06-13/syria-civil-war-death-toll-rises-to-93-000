At least 93,000 people have been
killed in  Syria  since peaceful protests against President Bashar al-Assad more than two years ago sparked a civil war, the  United
Nations  said in an analysis of casualties.  In an update of the inaugural January study, the UN
examined seven different datasets of killings between March 2011
and April 2013 provided by human rights groups and one by the
government that document deaths up to March 2012 only. The study
incorporated only fully identified fatalities, which include the
victim’s name, date and location of the killing, the UN said.  While the eight collated databases reported 92,901 unique
killings, the “true” number is “potentially much higher” as
nearly 38,000 cases were excised for insufficient information.
There is also “a strong likelihood that a significant number”
of deaths weren’t reported at all, UN High Commissioner for
Human Rights Navi Pillay said in a statement from Geneva today.  Participation of neighboring Lebanon’s Shiite Hezbollah
militia to back Assad has morphed civil strife between an
Alawite-led minority and mostly Sunni rebels into a broader
regional conflict along sectarian lines. The capture last week
by forces loyal to Assad of a strategic stronghold has been
described as an important turning point for the turmoil in his
favor.  While the analysis was not able to differentiate between
combatants and non-combatants, civilians are mostly “bearing
the brunt” of the conflict as Assad uses strategic missiles and
thermobaric bombs, Pillay said. Opposition forces are also
bombing residential areas, though with less fire-power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
