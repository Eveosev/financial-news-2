The U.S. government may want to
adjust its counter-terrorism policies so that the intrusion on
individual rights “are not as expansive,” state-run China
Daily said in an editorial today.  The commentary came after Edward Snowden, a former National
Security Agency contractor, earlier disclosed secret information
about U.S. surveillance program.  The article headlined  “Unjustified U.S. intelligence,”
said the debate triggered by Edward Snowden’s leaks is
“worthwhile,” if it can help the U.S. government find a better
balance between public safety and privacy.  “This is not the first time that U.S. government agencies’
wrong-doings have aroused widespread public concern” since the
American counter-terrorism policies were put in place following
the September 11 attacks, the editorial said.  The leaks drew public attention on what is permissible to
prevent terrorist attacks, according to the article.
Ramifications of government-sponsored spying on individuals
weigh much greater than the risks of conducting drone strikes
that target specific alleged terrorist suspects, the editorial
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
