Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY)  said it stopped a
mid-stage trial of an experimental Alzheimer’s drug attempting
to mimic the effect of a rare genetic mutation that may protect
against the disease.  Lilly ended the trial of the therapy, called LY2886721,
after participants showed abnormal liver biochemistry, the
Indianapolis-based company said today in a statement. The drug
was in the second of three phases of clinical trials typically
required before regulatory approval and was being tested in
about 150 patients, the company said.  “Lilly will further evaluate this data prior to
determining next steps for the entire LY2886721 clinical
development program,” the company said.  The drug was in a category called beta secretase, or BACE,
inhibitors.  Merck & Co. (MRK)  is developing a drug in the same class.
The therapies help prevent the formation of plaque tangles in
the brain called beta amyloid, which is associated with
Alzheimer’s.  The mechanism differs from that of a failed experimental
therapy from Johnson & Johnson and  Pfizer Inc. (PFE) , and one from
Lilly that is still in development. Those drugs are designed to
clear beta amyloid from the brain by binding directly to the
protein.  To contact the reporter on this story:
