West Texas Intermediate crude
futures have supports around $93.80 a barrel, where the 200-day
and 50-day moving average of the July contract converged,
according to a  technical analysis  by Iitrader.com.  The contract has traded above $93.80 for the past four days
and is below the resistance level of $98.22, the three-month
intraday high, according to Bill Baruch, a senior market
strategist at Iitrader.com in  Chicago . The 50-day moving average
closed at $93.79 yesterday and the 200-day average settled at
$93.77.  “The 50-day and 200-day averages are down there roughly
around $93.80 and that’s the bottom side of support,” said
Baruch. “The market is in a trading range. There is no real
catalyst right now to push it above or below.”  Oil for July delivery gained 81 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
settle at a three-week high of $96.69 yesterday on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange. Since July became the front-month contract
on May 22, the price has ranged from $91.26 to $96.92,
yesterday’s intraday high.  A break above the resistance level might send WTI to $100,
Baruch said. Prices may move toward $90 if they fall below the
support level.  To contact the reporter on this story:
