Nelja Energia AS, an Estonian
renewable-energy developer, opened the biggest wind farm in
 Lithuania , which will generate enough power for 27,000 homes.  The 57.4 million-euro ($76.5 million) Ciuteliai plant has
17 turbines with 39.1 megawatts of capacity, according to a
statement on Nelja Energia’s website. The facility north of
Silute is 19 kilometers (11 miles) from the Baltic Sea coast.  Nelja Energia supplied equity and won a 41 million-euro
loan from  Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (SEBA)  and  Pohjola Bank Plc (POH1S) 
to finance the plant, Tadas Navickas, managing director of
4energia UAB, the company’s Lithuanian unit, said by e-mail.  Nelja Energia, based in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, is
planning about 170 megawatts of wind, mostly in Latvia and
Lithuania, where installed capacity may double to 500 megawatts
by 2015, the Baltic nation’s wind-energy association said in
November. Wind-power expansion will help Lithuania curb its
reliance on Russian electricity imports and counter a shortfall
caused by closing nuclear capacity, according to the industry
group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
