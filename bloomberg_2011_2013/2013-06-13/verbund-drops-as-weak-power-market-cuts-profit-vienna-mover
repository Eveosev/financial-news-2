Verbund AG (VER) ,  Austria ’s biggest power
company, fell for the first time in five days in Vienna after
the company raised warnings that weakening European electricity
markets will hurt profits.  Shares fell as much as 36 cents, or 2.3 percent, to 15.60
euros and traded at 15.69 euros at 9:15 a.m. in Vienna.
Verbund’s stock has fallen 15 percent in the last year, giving
the company a market value of 5.5 billion euros ($7.3 billion).  “Economic conditions for electricity suppliers in Europe
have deteriorated even more in recent weeks,” Verbund said late
yesterday in a statement issued after markets had closed.
“Wholesale prices for electricity remain under sustained
pressure.”  Full-year earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization will be at least 1.15 billion euros, a 7 percent
drop from 2012, the company said. Net income will rise at least
54 percent to 600 million euros after a one-time gain on asset
sales, the Vienna-based company said.  Verbund swapped power-generating assets in  Turkey  with  E.On
SE (EOAN)  in December after deciding to curtail its international
expansion and focus on Austria and southern Germany. The
company, which generates most of its power from hydro plants in
the Alps and along Austrian rivers, reiterated it will pay a 1-euro dividend in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
