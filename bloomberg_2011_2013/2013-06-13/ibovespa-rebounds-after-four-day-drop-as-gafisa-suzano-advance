The  Ibovespa (IBOV)  rose for the first time
in five days as  Gafisa SA (GFSA3)  led a rally in Brazilian homebuilders
and commodity exporters gained.  Power utility  Cia. Paranaense de Energia  rose after saying
it didn’t make an offer for bankrupt Rede Empresas de Energia
Eletrica SA’s assets. Pulpmaker Suzano Papel & Celulose SA
gained after Morgan Stanley raised its recommendation on the
stock to the equivalent of buy. OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes
SA tumbled as concern deepened that the company will restructure
its debt.  The Ibovespa rose 0.8 percent to 49,563.15 at 11:14 a.m. in
Sao Paulo with 44 of its 71 member stocks gaining. The real
strengthened 0.8 percent to 2.1397 per dollar, rebounding from a
four-year low after the government removed a 1 percent tax
charged on bets against the dollar in the futures market.  Gafisa rose 5.1 percent to 3.51 reais. It was the best
performance on the BM&F Bovespa Real Estate Index, which gained
0.8 percent. Steelmaker Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA climbed 3.8
percent to 6.09 reais as the MSCI Brazil/Materials Index
advanced the most among 10 industry groups. Copel, as Paranaense
de Energia is also known, added 2.9 percent to 33.11 reais.  OGX sank 1.9 percent to 1.02 reais as its bonds due 2018
sank to a record low 40 cents on the dollar. A press official
for OGX’s holding company, EBX Group Co., didn’t respond to a
request for comment when contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
