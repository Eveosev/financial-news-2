Japan’s bonds climbed, setting 10-year yields up for their biggest decline in more than two
months, as a plunge in shares boosted demand for safer assets.  Yields on securities with a maturity of five years or
longer fell as the yen climbed to the strongest since April 4
when the  Bank of Japan  said it would double monthly debt
purchases to achieve 2 percent inflation. The nation’s bonds
advanced along with Treasuries before a policy-setting meeting
of the  Federal Open Market Committee  on June 18-19.  “Bonds are being bought because of yen appreciation and
stock declines,” said Shuichi Ohsaki, a strategist in Tokyo at
Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “Investors would like to see the
outcome of the FOMC meeting next week.”  The yield on Japan’s benchmark 10-year note dropped 7 1/2
basis points to 0.795 percent as of 11:06 a.m. in Tokyo, set for
the biggest slide since April 4. The 0.8 percent security due
June 2023 added 0.690 yen to 100.046, according to  Japan  Bond
Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The
10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell 3 basis points to 2.20 percent.  Japan’s 5-year yield declined 3 basis points to 0.305
percent, while the 20-year yield fell 4 1/2 basis points to 1.65
percent. The thirty-year yield retreated 4 basis points to 1.78
percent. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The  Topix index  of local shares tumbled as much as 5.1
percent. It’s lost 19 percent since it reached an almost five-year high on May 23. The yen strengthened 1.2 percent to 94.84
per dollar, clouding the earnings prospects of exporters.  BOJ board member Sayuri Shirai said today that Japanese
stocks and the yen are in a correction period. She is slightly
more mindful of downside risks to the fiscal 2014 outlook for
consumer prices, Shirai said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
