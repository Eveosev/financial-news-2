The rand rallied after the  World
Bank  cut its forecast for global growth, easing concern central
banks are preparing to curtail monetary stimulus that fueled
demand for emerging-market assets.  U.S. Treasuries rose alongside Japanese and Australian
bonds after the World Bank pared its projections for economic
expansion in 2013 to 2.2 percent from a January estimate of 2.4
percent. Foreign investors were net buyers of South African
bonds yesterday after four straight days of outflows.  “The sell-off in emerging-market debt has eased,”  John Cairns , a currency strategist at Rand Merchant Bank in
Johannesburg, said in e-mailed comments. “This is very apparent
in our market, where Tuesday’s drop-back in yields across the
curve has been sustained.”  South Africa ’s currency gained 1.4 percent to 9.9751 per
dollar as of 11:40 a.m. in Johannesburg. Yields on benchmark
10.5 percent bonds due December 2026 fell three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 7.92 percent, after dropping 32 basis
points in the previous two days.  Foreign investors bought a net 1.95 billion rand ($194
million) of South African bonds yesterday, resulting in net
inflows this month of 291 million rand after outflows of 4.71
billion rand in May, according to JSE Ltd.  data .  South Africa’s benchmark stock  index  dropped 1 percent to
the lowest level since May 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
