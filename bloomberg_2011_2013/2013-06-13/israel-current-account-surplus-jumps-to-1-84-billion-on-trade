Israel posted a  current-account 
surplus, as net exports increased, the  Central Bureau of
Statistics  said today.  The seasonally-adjusted surplus was $1.84 billion in the
first quarter, compared with a revised $526 million in the
October-December period, the statistics bureau said in an e-mailed statement. Last year, the country posted a surplus of a
revised $849 million, compared with a surplus of $3.26 billion
in 2011 and $7.17 billion in 2010.  Israel has maintained an annual surplus in its current
account since 2003, driven by exports, which make up about 40
percent of gross domestic product. The surplus is expected to
continue this year, as first-time natural gas production begins,
cutting the need for energy imports.  Israel  posted a $1.68 billion surplus in trade in goods and
services in the first quarter, compared with a $492 million
surplus the previous three months, the bureau said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
