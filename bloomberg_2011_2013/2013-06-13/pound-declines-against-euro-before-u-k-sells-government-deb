Gilts advanced for a second day
after the the  World Bank  said it had cut its global growth
forecast, fueling demand for safer assets.  Gilts also rose with Treasuries and bunds. The pound rose
to a four-month high against the dollar, breaking through its
200-day moving average for the first time in almost five months.
The U.K. Debt Management Office sold 2.25 billion pounds of
government debt maturing in 2032. European stocks were little
changed after falling to a seven-week low.  “After all the turmoil in equity markets we have got a bit
of safe-haven buying in bond markets,” said  Marc Ostwald , a
strategist at Monument Securities Ltd. in London. “You’re going
to have global growth at around 2.2 percent if the World Bank is
right and you’re certainly not going to be tightening in that
arena.”  The 10-year gilt yield fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.12 percent at 4:51 p.m. London time after
dropping three basis points yesterday, the most since May 30.
The 1.75 percent security due in September 2022 rose 0.16 or
1.60 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 96.88.  The global economy will expand 2.2 percent this year, less
than a January forecast for 2.4 percent growth and slower than
last year’s 2.3 percent, the World Bank said in a report
released yesterday in Washington.  The MSCI Asia Pacific  Index (BRIT)  of stocks tumbled 2.2 percent,
erasing this year’s gains, while the Stoxx Europe 600 Index
dropped as much as 1.7 percent to the least since April 23.  Fed Program  The European equity benchmark has lost 6.5 percent since
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on May 22 that the
central bank may pare its asset-purchase program if the  U.S.
economy  shows sustainable improvement.  The U.K. debt office sold the 2032 gilts at an average
yield of 3.004 percent, compared with 2.661 percent at a
previous auction of the securities on Oct. 9. Investors bid for
1.45 times the amount of bonds sold, down from a so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 2.12 in October.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 1.8 percent this year
through yesterday, according to the Bloomberg U.K. Sovereign
Bond Index. German bonds dropped 1.1 percent and Treasuries fell
1.5 percent, separate Bloomberg indexes show.  The  Bank of England  will start providing forward guidance
on monetary policy in a manner similar to the U.S. Federal
Reserve when  Mark Carney  replaces  Mervyn King  as governor next
month, former U.K. policy maker  Adam Posen  said today.  ‘Forward Guidance’  “What I’m pretty sure Carney and the Monetary Policy
Committee will do by August is some form of forward guidance,”
Posen told Francine Lacqua in an interview on “The Pulse” on
Bloomberg Television in London.  The pound gained 0.1 percent to $1.5695 after rising to
$1.5738, the highest since Feb. 11. It broke through its 200-day
moving average, at $1.5701 for the first time since Jan. 18.
