Natural gas futures declined after
rebounding from the lowest level in three months amid forecasts
of warmer-than-average weather that would increase demand for
the power-station fuel.  Gas for July delivery slid as much as 0.6 percent to $3.756
per million British thermal units in electronic trading on the
 New York  Mercantile Exchange and was at $3.758 at 12:52 p.m.
Singapore time. The contract gained 1.4 percent to settle at
$3.777 yesterday.  Temperatures may be above normal in the southern and
central U.S. through June 21, according to MDA Weather Services
in Gaithersburg, Maryland June 12. The high in  Dallas  on June 15
may be 98 degrees Fahrenheit (37 Celsius), 6 more than usual,
said AccuWeather Inc. in State College,  Pennsylvania .  The high in New Orleans on June 15 may be 95 degrees, 6
more than usual, AccuWeather predicted. Power generation
accounts for 32 percent of U.S. gas demand, according to the
Energy Information Administration, the Energy Department’s
statistical arm.  “We’re getting a little bit of an early taste of summer,”
Tom Saal, senior vice president of energy trading at FCStone
Latin America LLC in Miami, said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
