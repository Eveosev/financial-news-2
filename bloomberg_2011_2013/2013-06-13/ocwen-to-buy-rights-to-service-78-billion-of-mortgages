Ocwen Financial Corp. (OCN) , a provider of
loan and asset-management services, agreed to buy contracts to
handle payment collections on about $78 billion of mortgages
from OneWest Bank FSB.  The servicing rights are being purchased for $2.53 billion,
Ocwen said today in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
filing. The deal is likely to be completed by the end of the
year, the  West Palm Beach , Florida-based company said.  Ocwen is seeking to become one of the countryâ€™s largest
mortgage servicers. Chief Executive Officer Ronald Faris is
betting the company can profit as some banks leave the $9.6
trillion industry. OneWest is the successor to IndyMac Bancorp,
which was seized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. in 2008.  The filing was made after the close of regular U.S.
trading. Ocwen rose 3.6 percent to $45.74 at the close in New
York. Its shares have gained 32 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
