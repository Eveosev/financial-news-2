Nucor Corp. (NUE) , the largest U.S.
steelmaker by market value, forecast second-quarter profit that
missed analysts’ estimates as it reported “weaker performance”
at its sheet and structural-steel units.  Earnings will drop to 25 cents to 30 cents a share from 35
cents a year earlier, the  Charlotte , North Carolina-based
company said in a statement today. The average of 18 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg was for 38 cents.  “Non-residential construction markets continue to lack
sustained momentum,” Nucor said in the statement.  The price of  hot-rolled coil  in the U.S. Midwest, a
benchmark steel product, has averaged $592 a ton so far in the
current quarter, according to data from Steel Business Briefing.
That’s 10 percent less than the $657-a-ton average for the
second quarter last year.  Nucor rose 0.1 percent to $43.98 at 9:35 a.m. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
