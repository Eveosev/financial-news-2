Indonesia ’s rupiah fell to the
weakest level since September 2009 after foreign funds pulled
money from the nation’s assets amid a delay in cutting fuel
subsidies that has undermined investor confidence. Bonds gained.  The rupiah fell 0.3 percent to 9,886 per dollar as of 9:30
a.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks compiled
by Bloomberg. It touched 9,925 earlier, the weakest since Sept.
15, 2009. One-month non-deliverable forwards dropped 1.2 percent
to 10,230, trading at a 3.4 percent discount to the spot rate.  Overseas investors withdrew $1.3 billion from local stocks
this month on speculation the  Federal Reserve  will reduce asset
purchases that have fueled fund flows to  emerging markets . The
government has still not cut fuel subsidies, which have put
pressure on the country’s budget and current-account deficits,
after saying in January prices may be adjusted.  Bank Indonesia 
will hold its benchmark rate at 5.75 percent today, according to
all 19 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Crucially, the government will have to demonstrate
ability to rationalize the fuel subsidy burden, amongst other
reforms to rein in current-account and budget deficits,” said
 Vishnu Varathan , an economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in
Singapore. “The risk of the rupiah falling to 10,500 to 11,000
per dollar cannot be discounted,” should the dollar’s broader
rally continue.  Fasbi Raised  The Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against six
major partners, has rallied 4.5 percent since May 22, the day
Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said bond buying could be reduced.  Bank Indonesia raised the deposit facility rate, known as
the Fasbi, by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25 percent
yesterday, in what it described as a preemptive move to maintain
monetary stability. Fuel prices will be lifted after the 2013
budget revision is finished by June 17, Coordinating Minister
for the Economy Hatta Rajasa said last week.  One-month implied volatility in the rupiah, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
climbed nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 13.73
percent, taking its gain this month to 5.1 percentage points.  The yield on the 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023 fell one
basis point to 6.51 percent, after sliding 17 basis points
yesterday, according to the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
