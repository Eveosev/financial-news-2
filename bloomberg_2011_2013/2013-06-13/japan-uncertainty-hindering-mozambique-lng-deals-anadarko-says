Uncertainty over government policy
is keeping Japanese buyers from signing contracts for fuel from
the world’s second-largest liquefied natural gas plant planned
in  Mozambique , according to one of the project’s developers.  Buyers from the Asian nation have been reluctant to commit
to buying fuel from the African country because of pending
Japanese government decisions on nuclear plant restarts and
power grid policies that will affect future demand, A. Scott
Moore, vice president of marketing for  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) 
said today in Tokyo.  Buyers from the world’s biggest importer of LNG are also
waiting for clarity from the Obama administration on how much
U.S. gas will be available to the Asian country, Moore said in
an interview.  “They’re very interested in adding Mozambique to their
portfolios and they have a number of really policy-driven
uncertainties that impact their view of their future,” he said.
“Other countries -- India,  Thailand , China -- I think have
fewer complications to address.”  The Woodlands, Texas-based Anadarko and Eni of Italy agreed
last year to build what would be the world’s second-largest
liquefied gas export plant at 50 million tons a year when
completely developed. Anadarko plans to begin shipping LNG from
the plant in 2018, Moore said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
