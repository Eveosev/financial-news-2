European Union antitrust regulators
invited comments on  Visa Europe  Ltd.’s offer to cut
“significantly” the fees it sets for processing cross-border
credit-card payments in a bid to end an EU antitrust probe.  Visa  Europe ’s offer from last month would bring its fees
into line with those of its main competitor  MasterCard Inc. (MA) , the
European Commission said in an e-mailed statement today. The
operator of the EU’s largest payment-card network has also
offered to overhaul its rules so that banks will be able to
apply a reduced interbank fee when they compete for clients
across borders.  “If the proposals address the commission’s competition
concerns, the commission may decide to make them legally binding
on Visa Europe” in exchange for ending the probe, the regulator
said.  The commission sent a formal complaint to Visa about the
interchange fees last year, as part of a broader campaign it has
waged against such charges. MasterCard has started a legal
challenge against a settlement it reached with the commission in
2009 to avoid a daily penalty of as much as 3.5 percent of
sales. The EU is also probing MasterCard’s bank fees on foreign
card payments such as when tourists go shopping in the 27-nation
bloc.  The EU regulator also announced today that it has closed a
probe into the European Payments Council, an association of
banks that seeks to standardize payments practices, after the
body stopped its work on e-payment rules at the center of the
probe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
