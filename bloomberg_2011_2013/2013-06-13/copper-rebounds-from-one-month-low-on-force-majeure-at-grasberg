Copper rebounded from a one-month
low after  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX)  declared force
majeure on shipments from the world’s second-biggest mine of the
metal in  Indonesia . Industrial metals advanced.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 1 percent to $7,190 a metric ton and
was at $7,156.75 by 11:33 a.m. in  Tokyo . The price touched
$7,020 yesterday, the lowest since May 3. Metal for delivery in
July on the Comex was little changed at $3.227 a pound.  Freeport declared force majeure on copper concentrate
shipments from its Grasberg operation after an accident on May
14 killed 28 workers. Force majeure is a clause in a contract
invoked by commodity suppliers when they can’t meet obligations
because of circumstances beyond their control.  “It’s a big producer of copper and that would definitely
have an impact on supply,” said  David Lennox , an analyst at Fat
Prophets in Sydney. “The market is scrambling for copper in the
event that Grasberg stays closed for a long period of time.”  The stoppage at Grasberg is reducing output by about 3
million pounds of copper (1,361 tons) and 3,000 ounces of gold a
day, Freeport said yesterday. That’s equal to about 2.9 percent
of average daily global copper output this year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The Indonesian unit lost about 80
million pounds of copper and 80,000 ounces of gold production
between May 15 and June 11, the company said.  Copper for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange retreated 2.3 percent to 51,850  yuan  ($8,447) a ton as
the trading resumed after a three-day holiday.  On the LME, nickel climbed for the first time in seven days.
Yesterday it fell to the lowest since July 2009 after data from
the bourse showed stockpiles rose to a record. Lead, tin,
aluminum and zinc climbed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
