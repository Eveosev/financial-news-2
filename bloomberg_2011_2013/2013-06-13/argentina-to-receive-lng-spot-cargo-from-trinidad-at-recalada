Argentina, which has no long-term
contracts to import liquefied natural gas, is scheduled to
receive a cargo today from Trinidad & Tobago, according to ship-tracking data.  The SCF Arctic, with a capacity of about 72,000 cubic
meters, will arrive at the port of Recalada near  Buenos Aires ,
according to ship transmissions captured by IHS Fairplay on
Bloomberg. The vessel stopped at Atlantic LNG Co.’s Point Fortin
terminal on May 29 to load the supercooled gas, the data show.  Argentina imports LNG through YPF SA, the country’s largest
energy company, and state-run Energia Argentina SA, known as
Enarsa. YPF closed a tender on May 6 to buy seven LNG cargoes
for delivery to  Bahia Blanca . Enarsa and YPF have issued seven
spot tenders seeking as many as 150 shipments since December.  Latin America’s LNG import capacity will increase to 49.2
million metric tons a year in 2020 from a projected 30 million
this year, Anton Safronov, Total SA’s LNG origination director,
said in  Singapore  on May 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
