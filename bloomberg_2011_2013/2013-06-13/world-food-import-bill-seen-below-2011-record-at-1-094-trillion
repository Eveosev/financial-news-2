The world’s food-import bill is
expected to remain stable this year as cheaper sugar and cooking
oils compensate for increased costs of dairy, fish and meat,
according to the Food & Agriculture Organization.  Countries will spend $1.094 trillion to import food this
year from $1.092 trillion in 2012, the Rome-based United Nations
agency wrote in its biannual Food Outlook report today. Food-import costs rose to a record $1.26 trillion in 2011.  An index of world  food prices  tracked by the FAO stood at
215.2 points last month, up 5.1 percent from a year earlier and
down from a record 237.9 points in February 2011.  “The stability of the global import expenditure masks
considerable movements across individual product bills,” the
FAO said. “Freight costs, which are not expected to vary
significantly from 2012 levels, also contribute to stability.”  The costs of importing animal-protein products including
dairy, meat and fish may increase 8 percent to $354 billion on
larger volumes as well as higher prices, particularly for dairy
products and fish, the FAO said.  Imports of vegetable oils and animal fats may drop to $92.8
billion from $99.1 billion, while the bill for sugar may slide
to $38.7 billion from $47 billion, the report showed.  The costs for buying vegetables and fruits are seen little
changed, climbing $1.2 billion to $191.8 billion, while the
grain import bill may slip $1.1 billion to $163.3 billion.  Staple Crops  “Abundant” domestic harvests of staple crops in low-income food deficit countries are expected to reduce their need
to rely on foreign supplies, according to the FAO.  “However, with much lower international prices for key
export primary commodities, such as sugar and tropical
beverages, the terms-of-trade in food and agriculture for
commodity-dependent countries may also deteriorate,” it said.  World grain production is forecast to climb 6.5 percent to
2.46 billion metric tons in 2013, the report showed.  “Latest indications point to a more comfortable world
cereal supply-and-demand balance,” the UN agency said.“Good
production prospects and a likely replenishment in world stocks
could pave the way for calmer markets and some easing of prices
in the new season.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
