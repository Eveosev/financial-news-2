The U.S. suffered 11 weather and
climate disasters last year that caused more than $1 billion in
damage each and killed more than 300 people, making 2012 the
second-most costly and active year on record, according to the
 National Climatic Data Center .  Disasters including  Hurricane Sandy  and the drought cost an
estimated $114.6 billion, according to data compiled by the
center in Asheville,  North Carolina . Sandy was the worst at $65
billion, while the drought’s cost was estimated at $30 billion.  “The yearlong drought, which affected more than half the
country for the majority of 2012, and the associated heat waves
caused over 100 direct deaths,” the agency, a unit of the
 National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration , said in a
statement today.  Last year ranked second in terms of cost behind 2005, with
an estimated $160 billion in damage. That was the year  Hurricane
Katrina  struck the U.S. Gulf Coast, leading to widespread
destruction in Louisiana and  Mississippi .  Last year was also second in the number of events causing
$1 billion or more in damage, behind 2011, which had 14. The
2012 disasters included Hurricane Isaac in August, tornadoes in
the Midwest and Texas, wildfires in the West and the derecho
wind storm that left destruction from the Midwest to the mid-Atlantic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
