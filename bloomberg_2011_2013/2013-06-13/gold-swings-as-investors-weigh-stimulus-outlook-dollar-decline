Gold and silver fell 1 percent after
fewer Americans than forecast filed applications for
 unemployment benefits  last week, easing pressure on the  Federal
Reserve  to maintain stimulus measures to bolster the economy.  Jobless  claims  dropped to 334,000 in the week ended June 8
from 346,000 a week earlier, according to government data. U.S.
retail sales rose more than forecast in May, a separate report
showed today. Gold has fallen 18 percent this year amid concern
that Fed may scale back debt purchases as the economy gains.  “The jobless numbers lend support to the idea that the Fed
will slow the pace of the stimulus,”  Frank McGhee , the head
dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in Chicago, said in
a telephone interview. “The overall sentiment remains
bearish.”  Gold futures for August delivery declined $14.20 to settle
at $1,377.80 an ounce at 1:38 p.m. on Comex in New York. The 60-day historical volatility was 28.88 percent, the highest since

$21.583 an ounce on the Comex. The price has tumbled 29 percent
this year.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for

percent to $731.05 an ounce, the largest decline since April 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
