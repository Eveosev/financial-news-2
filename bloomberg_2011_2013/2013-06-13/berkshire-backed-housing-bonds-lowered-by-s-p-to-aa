Berkshire Hathaway Inc.-insured
bonds tied to housing were cut one level to AA from AA+ by
Standard & Poor’s after the ratings firm lowered its grade on
the parent company last month.  “All of these issues receive partial support via
guaranteed investment contracts or investment agreements” from
Berkshire or some of its subsidiaries, S&P said today in a
statement about the Omaha, Nebraska-based firm led by  Warren Buffett .  To contact the reporter on this story:
