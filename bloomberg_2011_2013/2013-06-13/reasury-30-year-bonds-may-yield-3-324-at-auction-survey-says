The Treasury’s $13 billion sale of
30-year bonds may draw a  yield  of 3.324 percent, the highest
since March 2012, according to the average forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of eight of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21
primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in May 2043, yielded 3.315
percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m.  New York 
time. The yield at the last offering of long bonds, on May 9,
was 2.98 percent, and the record-low auction yield was 2.580
percent in July.  The May sale’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was 2.53,
versus an average of 2.58 at the past 10 auctions.  Indirect bidders , a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 38.8 percent of the bonds at the
May sale, versus 31.4 percent at the April auction. The average
at the past 10 offerings was 36.7 percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 15.5 percent of
the securities at last month’s sale. The average for the past 10
auctions is 13.8 percent.  Thirty-year bonds have lost 7 percent this year, compared
with a 1.6 percent drop in the broader U.S. Treasuries market,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Long bonds
returned 2.5 percent in 2012, versus a 2.2 percent gain by
Treasuries overall.  The U.S. sold $21 billion of  10-year debt  yesterday at a
yield of 2.209 percent and auctioned $32 billion of three-year
notes on June 11 at a yield of 0.581 percent.  Primary dealers trade  government securities  with the Fed
and are obliged to participate in Treasury sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
