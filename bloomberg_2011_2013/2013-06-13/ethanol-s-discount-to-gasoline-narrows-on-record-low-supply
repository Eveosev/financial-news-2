Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
swelled to the widest in nine weeks on concern the fuel’s gain
this year will attract Brazilian supply.  The spread, or price difference, widened 2.12 cents to
40.03 cents a gallon a day after raw-sugar futures dropped to
the lowest price in almost three years. While corn is mostly
used to make ethanol in the U.S., the Brazilian variety is
derived from the sweetener.  “We keep watching sugar prices make new lows,” said Chris
Wilson, a broker at Atten Babler Risk Management LLC in Galena,
 Illinois . “There’s the thought that we’ll get bombarded with
Brazilian ethanol over the next 45 days.”  Denatured ethanol for July delivery rose 3 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $2.461 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 12 percent this year.  Gasoline for July delivery gained 5.12 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $2.8613 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol  imports  have averaged 17,000 barrels a day through
June 7, an Energy Information Administration report showed
yesterday, up from 6,000 during the same period in 2012.  Anhydrous fuel ethanol in Sao Paulo cost $2.33 a gallon
last week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, down from
$2.65 in April.  Ethanol in  Brazil ’s Center-South, the main sugarcane
growing region, rose to 1.57 billion liters (9.86 million
barrels) in the second half of May from 1.29 billion a year
earlier, Sao Paulo-based industry group Unica said in a June 11
report. Mills turned 58.2 percent of cane into ethanol, up from
51.7 percent a year ago, it said.  Ethanol Production  U.S. ethanol production was little changed at 884,000
barrels a day in the week ended June 7, down from 885,000 a year
earlier and the record 963,000 in December 2011, the Energy
Department’s analytical arm said. Stockpiles tumbled 2.6 percent
to 16 million barrels, the lowest level in records begun in June
2010.  Corn for July delivery fell 7.25 cents, or 1.1 percent, to
$6.435 a bushel in  Chicago . The corn crush spread, or the cost
difference between ethanol and the corn needed to make it, was
12 cents a gallon, up from 6 cents yesterday.  In cash market trading, ethanol sank 3.5 cents to $2.595 a
gallon in New York, 0.5 cent to $2.605 on the Gulf Coast and 2
cents to $2.81 on the West Coast, data compiled by Bloomberg
shows. The price in Chicago rose 1.5 cents to $2.525 a gallon.  Chicago’s discount to New York Harbor narrowed 5 cents to 7
cents. The West Coast’s premium to the Gulf Coast slimmed 1.5
cents to 20.5 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
