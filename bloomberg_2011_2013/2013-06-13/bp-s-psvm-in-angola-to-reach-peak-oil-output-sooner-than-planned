BP Plc (BP/)  said that Angola’s PSVM
project, the largest subsea oil and gas development, will reach
peak production of 150,000 barrels of oil a day in December,
earlier than previously expected.  The company said in January that output wouldn’t reach that
level until 2014. The project is currently producing about
100,000 barrels a day, up from 70,000 barrels earlier this year,
said Martyn Morris, BP’s regional president.  ‘There aren’t any delays,’’ Morris said in an interview on
June 10 in the capital of Luanda.  Angola is one of BP’s most profitable production hubs, and
the development of PSVM, named after the Plutao, Saturno, Venus
and Marte fields, has already received about $10 billion of
investment, state-run Televisao Publica de Angola reported June
10. BP’s partners in the project include Sonangol, the Angolan
state oil company,  Statoil ASA (STL)  and  Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO)   Angola endured a 27-year civil war that ended in 2002. It’s
now the second-largest oil producer in Africa after Nigeria with
output of 1.8 million barrels of oil a day.  “This is a milestone not just for Angola but also for the
world,” Morris said. “We are happy with how PSVM is doing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
