Chilean stocks  rose the most this
year amid speculation that the six-day decline that pushed
valuations to an 18-month low was excessive.  The  Ipsa (IPSA)  index increased 1.5 percent to 3,984.01 at 3:54
p.m. in Santiago. The benchmark sank 6.5 percent in the prior
six sessions, driving the average  price-to-earnings ratio  of its
40 member stocks to 20.22, the lowest since December 2011.  Pulpmaker  Empresas Copec SA (COPEC) , the heaviest-weighted stock on
the Ipsa, rebounded after its price-to-earnings ratio reached
33.3, the lowest since September.  Latam Airlines SA (LFL)  contributed
the most to the benchmark’s advance.  “It’s a combination of a technical rebound after a violent
fall in recent days and some signs of more investor confidence
in the region,” German Guerrero, a partner at brokerage MBI
Inversiones, said in a telephone interview from Santiago.
“Proof of that is that the peso and other Latin American
currencies are strengthening.”  Chile’s peso gained 0.8 percent today, the most among major
Latin American currencies after the  Mexican peso , which advanced
1.9 percent.  The Ipsa sank yesterday to its lowest level since October
2011 as investors withdrew funds from  emerging markets  on
speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve could reduce its
asset-purchasing program amid signs of faster economic growth.
The benchmark has fallen 15 percent from a this year’s high of
4,614.66 on Feb. 13.  Copec increased 2.3 percent today to 6,410 pesos. Latam
Airlines advanced 3.4 percent to 8,605 pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
