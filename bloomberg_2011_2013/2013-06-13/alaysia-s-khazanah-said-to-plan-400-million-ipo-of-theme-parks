Khazanah Nasional Bhd.,  Malaysia ’s
state investment company, plans to raise as much as $400 million
in an initial public offering of its theme park business, said
two people with knowledge of the matter.  Khazanah is working with  Malayan Banking Bhd. (MAY)  and Bank of
America Corp. on the share sale of  Themed Attractions and
Resorts Bhd ., the people said, asking not to be named as the
process is private. The Kuala Lumpur IPO may raise $300 million
to $400 million as early as this year, they said.  Themed Attractions and Resorts, led by managing director
Ahmad Burhanuddin, owns resorts including KidZania, Legoland
Malaysia and Puteri Harbour Family Theme Park, which houses the
first Sanrio Hello Kitty Town outside  Japan .  Khazanah, wholly owned by the Malaysian government, plans
to sell more domestic assets while expanding overseas, managing
director Azman Mokhtar said in March.  Asuki Abas, a spokesman for Khazanah, declined to comment
on the IPO plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
