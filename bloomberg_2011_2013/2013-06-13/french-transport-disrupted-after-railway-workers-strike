French train transport was disrupted
today after four railroad employees’ unions called a strike to
protest a planned reorganization of the service.  Only four out of 10 high-speed and regional trains are
running, national rail company SNCF said on its website. The
Intercite trains, which provide a non-high-speed long-distance
service, are at a third of their normal level, it said.
Eurostar, Thalys and trains heading to  Germany  are not affected,
 SNCF  said.  While the metro service in Paris was normal, only one out
of three trains serving the region around the capital city was
running.  Participation is “very strong with one out of two rail
employees on strike,”  Gilbert Garrel , a CGT union
representative, was cited as saying by  Agence France-Presse .  SNCF spokesman Frank Paul Weber said in an e-mailed message
that about 70 percent of on-board ticket collectors, conductors,
inspectors and train drivers were on strike.  The strike, which began at 7 p.m. last night, is set to
continue until 8:00 a.m. tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
