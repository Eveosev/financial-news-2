The  Denver Broncos  released running
back Willis McGahee, an 11-year veteran who had a team-leading
731 rushing yards last season, after selecting Montee Ball in
the second round of this year’s National Football League draft.  McGahee, 31, totaled 1,930 rushing yards and eight
touchdowns over the past two seasons in Denver. He was selected
to the Pro Bowl after the 2011 season, when he ran for 1,119
yards and helped the Broncos set a franchise-record with a
league-leading 164.5 rushing yards per game.  “It’s never easy to part ways with a veteran player who
made so many positive contributions to our team and community,”
Broncos Vice President of Football Operations  John Elway  said in
a statement. “I appreciate all of the competitiveness,
toughness and leadership Willis brought to the Broncos.”  In addition to Ball, who was the third running back taken
in this year’s draft after scoring 55 touchdowns at the
University of Wisconsin the past two years, the Broncos also
have C.J. Anderson, Lance Ball, Jacob Hester, Ronnie Hillman,
Jeremiah Johnson and Knowshon Moreno at running back. Moreno was
 second on the team  with 525 rushing yards last season.  McGahee’s 33 career 100-yard rushing games are tied for the
second-most among active players. He and Ricky Watters are the
only two players in NFL history to have 1,000 rushing yards in a
season for three different franchises. McGahee has also done it
for the  Buffalo Bills  and  Baltimore Ravens .  To contact the reporter on this story:
