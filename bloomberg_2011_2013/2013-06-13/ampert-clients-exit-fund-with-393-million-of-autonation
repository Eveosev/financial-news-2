Edward Lampert  used $393 million of
shares in  AutoNation Inc. (AN)  to meet client redemptions from his
main hedge fund, whose investment in  Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD)  has
led to volatile returns.  Lampert’s ESL Partners LP on June 10 distributed 9.09
million AutoNation shares, or about 41 percent of its stake in
the auto retailer, to investors who were redeeming their
interests in the fund, according to a regulatory filing June 12.
The fund also used part of its stake in  Orchard Supply Hardware
Stores Corp. (OSH)  to meet redemptions, filings show.  With Sears struggling, clients have been pulling money out
of ESL Partners. Gross assets declined 24 percent to $5.1
billion at end of 2012 from a year earlier, and the number of
investors in the fund dropped to 164 from 250, filings show. The
moves by Lampert leave the remaining investors in the hedge fund
even more concentrated in Sears, whose shares have slumped 19
percent since it reported a fiscal first-quarter loss of $279
million on May 23.  Steven Lipin, a spokesman for ESL who works for Brunswick
Group LLC, didn’t return a telephone call seeking comment.
Lampert’s firm, ESL Investments Inc., is based in Bay Harbor,
 Florida .  Lampert Stake  Lampert, who controls a majority  stake  in Sears through his
personal holdings and those of his firm, took over as the
 Hoffman Estates , Illinois-based retailer’s chief executive
officer in February after sales had declined for five
consecutive years. Sears rose 4.8 percent to $47.21 yesterday.  ESL Partners issued the AutoNation shares this week “on a
pro rata basis to limited partners that elected to redeem all or
a portion of their limited partnership interests in June 2013,”
the  fund manager  said in a Schedule 13D filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.  By issuing some of its holdings instead of cash to clients
who are withdrawing capital, ESL Partners can avoid selling
investments on the open market and protect its remaining clients
from being hit with capital-gains taxes. In February 2012, the
fund used $351 million of shares in AutoNation and  AutoZone Inc. (AZO) 
for withdrawals.  Lampert, 50, formed ESL Investments Inc. in 1998 after
working on the merger arbitrage desk of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
While the firm’s main hedge fund, ESL Partners, produced average
annual returns of about 25 percent for the first 14 years, its
subsequent performance has been volatile.  Volatile Returns  ESL Partners declined 27 percent in 2007 and 33 percent in
2008, and rebounded with gains of 55 percent in 2009 and 16
percent in 2010, two people familiar with the fund said last
year. ESL Partners fell 4 percent during the first nine months
of 2011, the most recent information available from these
people, who requested anonymity because the information is
confidential.  ESL in November distributed 5.9 million Sears shares to
limited partners for 2012 redemptions, according to a regulatory
filing. Lampert used $130 million of personal funds last year to
acquire Sears shares held by ESL Investors LLC, a partnership
that he formed for the Ziff family that follows the same
strategy as ESL Partners.  At the end of last year, ESL Partners and several
affiliates held U.S.-traded stocks with a market value of $3.84
billion, with Sears accounting for about 39 percent of the
total.  To contact the reporter on this story:
