SoftBank Corp. (9984) ’s new $21.6 billion
bid for Sprint Nextel Corp. won the endorsement of shareholder-advisory firm Egan-Jones Ratings Co., which had previously
opposed the deal.  The increased amount being paid to shareholders, along with
the view of Sprint’s board that SoftBank can improve the
wireless carrier’s operations, contributed to Egan-Jones’s
change in position, according to a report sent by the firm.  “Egan-Jones views the proposed transaction to be a
desirable approach in maximizing shareholder value,” Haverford,
Pennsylvania-based Egan-Jones said.  SoftBank, based in Tokyo, increased its bid from $20.1
billion, aiming to ward off a counteroffer from  Dish Network
Corp. (DISH)  In backing the SoftBank transaction earlier this week,
Sprint’s board said Dish never submitted an “actionable” bid.
It gave the satellite-TV company until June 18 to submit a “best
and final” offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
