Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  sold 25.4 million
shares of  Elan Corp. (ELN) , ending a relationship started four years
ago to develop the Alzheimer’s disease drug bapineuzumab.  J&J, based in  New Brunswick , New Jersey, bought an 18
percent stake in the Irish biotechnology company for $1 billion
in 2009 and took over bapineuzumab’s development. The medicine,
designed to slow Alzheimer’s by reducing amyloid plaque buildup,
failed last year in the final stage of testing.  J&J sold 82 million shares back to Elan on April 18, the
maximum allowed, as part of a Dutch auction, said Ernie Knewitz,
a company spokesman. It sold the remaining American depositary
receipts yesterday for  $332.5 million , carrying out J&J’s plans
to divest its Elan holdings following a portfolio review,
Knewitz said. Each receipt is equal to an ordinary Elan share.  The sale wasn’t related to Royalty Pharma’s $6.7 billion
bid to take over Elan, Knewitz said in a telephone interview.  J&J’s sale isn’t material for Elan, because it’s only 5
percent of the company and won’t affect the 50 percent required
to approve a transaction,  Michael Yee , an analyst at  RBC Capital
Markets  in San Francisco, said in an e-mail.  J&J, the world’s largest seller of health-care products,
was developing bapineuzumab with New York-based Pfizer Inc. Eli
Lilly & Co. said yesterday it stopped a mid-stage trial of
another Alzheimer’s disease drug, known as a BACE inhibitor,
after signs of potential liver problems.  J&J was unchanged at $84.91 at 4:04 p.m.  New York  time. The
American depositary receipts for Elan, which formally agreed to
a sales process today and invited Royalty Pharma to bid, rose
8.3 percent to $13.66.  To contact the reporter on this story:
