Palm oil  imports by  India , the
world’s biggest buyer, climbed to the highest level in three
months in May after domestic supplies fell and demand increased.  Purchases of crude and refined oils advanced 10 percent to
755,871 metric tons last month from 685,877 tons a year earlier,
the  Solvent Extractors’ Association of India  said in an e-mailed
statement today. That matched a median estimate of 750,000 tons
in a Bloomberg survey published last week and the most since
785,915 tons in February, according to the association. Imports
of  refined, bleached and deodorized palm olein  more than doubled
to 373,837 tons in May, the highest since 1994, it said.  Rising Indian imports may help futures in  Kuala Lumpur 
extend gains for a second month. Futures jumped to a two-month
high last week on speculation that a pick up in demand ahead of
the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan in July may help trim
stockpiles in  Malaysia , the second-largest producer.  “Local supply is not enough to meet the rising demand,”
B.V. Mehta, executive director of the association, said by phone
from Mumbai. “Demand is rising by 5 percent every year and we
would need about 800,000 tons of additional imports to meet this
increase.”  Total  vegetable oils  imports, including for industrial use,
gained 2.3 percent to 917,964 tons in May, the association said.
Shipments in the seven months through May rose 10 percent to 6.2
million tons, it said. Crude  palm oil  imports fell 27 percent to
382,034 tons in May from a year earlier, the association said.  Duty Difference  “It makes no sense to import crude palm oil now as the
duty difference between crude and refined has come down to $10
from $70 earlier,” Mehta said. India raised the import duty on
crude oils to 2.5 percent in January, and left the tax on
refined oils unchanged at 7.5 percent.  Palm for delivery in August was little changed at 2,452
ringgit ($780) a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange at
2:42 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur. Futures closed at 2,457 ringgit on
June 7, the highest price for the most-active contract since
March 25. Prices have climbed 2.3 percent this month after
gaining 4.9 percent in May.  India, the world’s biggest cooking oil consumer after
 China , meets more than half its demand through imports. It buys
palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia and  soybean oil  from the
U.S.,  Brazil  and  Argentina .  Soybean oil  imports fell 16 percent to 52,392 tons, while
sunflower oil imports declined 46 percent to 67,805 tons, it
said. Stockpiles, including those at the ports and in the
pipelines, climbed to 1.98 million tons as of June 1 from 1.82
million tons a month ago, the association data showed.  “The decline in the rupee will have a marginal impact on
imports as the fall in prices over the last few months have been
a silver lining and will provide some cushion to consumers,”
Mehta said.  The rupee fell to a record against the  U.S. dollar  on June
11, and the currency’s 7.1 percent drop this quarter is the
biggest in  Asia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
