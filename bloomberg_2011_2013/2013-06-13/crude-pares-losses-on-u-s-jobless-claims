West Texas Intermediate crude rose
to a three-week high as U.S. retail sales increased the most in
three months in May and equities rallied.  Futures gained 0.8 percent after the Commerce Department
reported sales advanced 0.6 percent and the Labor Department
said weekly jobless claims declined. Prices extended the rally
in the last 15 minutes of floor trading, along with the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index. August Brent futures jumped 1.3 percent as
the July contract expired.  “We are seeing signs that the economy is improving and
energy demand is going to be higher,” said  Gene McGillian , an
analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .
“We had some end-of-the-day buying as the equity markets
started to move higher. The longs are basically back in
charge.”  WTI for July delivery advanced 81 cents to $96.69 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement
since May 20. The volume of all futures traded was 5.4 percent
below the 100-day average for the time of day at 4:09 p.m.
Prices have jumped 5.3 percent this year.  May retail sales, growing at a faster pace than the 0.1
percent increase in April, showed job gains and lower borrowing
costs are encouraging consumers to spend. The  median  of 83
estimates by economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 0.4
percent rise.  Gasoline Demand  U.S. gasoline demand  averaged  8.8 million barrels a day in
the four weeks ended June 7, up 0.9 percent from the prior week,
the Energy Information Administration reported yesterday.  “The retail sales number is pretty solid and should be
good for oil,” said Jason Schenker, president of Prestige
Economics LLC, an Austin, Texas-based energy consultant. “The
story of modest economic growth continues, and we’ll see
continued oil demand growth.”  Jobless  claims  slid by 12,000 to 334,000 last week, fewer
than the 346,000  median forecast  by 51 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The four-week moving  average , a less-volatile measure
than the weekly figures, declined to 345,250 last week, the
lowest level since Sept. 21. It was 352,500 the prior week.  “The four-week average fell below 350,000, and it’s a
pretty good sign,” said Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist
at Confluence Investment Management in  St. Louis , which oversees
$1.4 billion. “We are seeing a pickup in retail consumption,
and it’s good. In the short run, it helps.”  The U.S., the world’s biggest oil-consuming country,
accounted for about a fifth of global demand in 2012, according
to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical Review of World Energy, released
yesterday.  Equities Climb  The  S&P 500 index  rallied 1.5 percent. The Dollar Index,
which measures the greenback against six other major currencies
including the euro, fell as much as 0.6 percent. A weaker dollar
increases oil’s appeal as an investment alternative.  “We continue to see a willingness on the part of investors
to buy on the back of the U.S. economic growth story,”  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New
York, said in an e-mail.  Brent oil traded on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange rose amid concern that Middle Eastern exports may be
disrupted by political unrest.  Middle East  Presidential elections will be held tomorrow in  Iran ,
holder of the world’s fourth-largest oil reserves. Protesters
returned to Istanbul’s Taksim Square as the biggest rallies in
more than 10 years spread nationwide after May 31.  Libya ’s
output has plunged by at least 600,000 barrels a day from more
than 1.6 million in the middle of last year, state-run NOC said
in a statement on June 11.  The  Middle East  is “definitely an important factor here,”
said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy. People are worried
“how quickly supplies can become tight again.”  Brent for July settlement, which expired today, climbed 76
cents, or 0.7 percent, to $104.25 a barrel on ICE. The more
actively traded August futures increased $1.39, or 1.3 percent,
to $104.95. Volume was 21 percent below the 100-day average for
the time of day.  August Brent increased more than the July futures as
commodity index funds rolled over to the next month’s contract
before the expiration, said Carl Larry, president of Oil
Outlooks & Opinions LLC in Houston.  WTI-Brent  Brent’s premium to WTI was little changed at $7.56 a barrel
from yesterday’s settlement of $7.61.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
August was 19.7 percent, compared with 20.2 percent yesterday,
data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 500,762
contracts at 4:11 p.m. It totaled 557,125 contracts yesterday,
7.8 percent lower than the three-month average. Open interest
was a record 1.82 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
