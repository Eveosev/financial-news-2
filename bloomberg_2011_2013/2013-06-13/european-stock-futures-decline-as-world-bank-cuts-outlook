European stocks were little changed
as better-than-estimated U.S. retail sales data offset investor
speculation that this year’s rally has overshot the outlook for
company earnings.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc slid 3.3 percent after
saying Chief Executive Officer  Stephen Hester  will resign this
year. Home Retail Group Plc fell the most since May 2012 as
first-quarter sales at its Argos stores missed analysts’
estimates. Rhoen-Klinikum AG jumped the most since August 2012
after its shareholders abolished a voting threshold for mergers.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slipped 0.1 percent to 290.51 at
the close of trading, paring an earlier loss of as much as 1.7
percent. The gauge has fallen 6.5 percent  since  Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said May 22 that the central bank may
pare stimulus measures if the  U.S. economy  improves sustainably.  “We’ve had very low volatility in this market rally and
now we’re getting more volatility,”  Tim Harris , who helps
oversee about $25 billion as head of investments at Lloyds TSB
Bank Plc, told Francine Lacqua on Bloomberg Television. “The
fact that global markets have risen from the lows of last autumn
by about 20 percent or so, people can get carried away with
that. Clearly that’s unsettling a lot of people.”  The VStoxx Index, a measure of volatility in the Euro Stoxx
50 Index, added 1.7 percent to 22.11. It gained 3.5 percent
yesterday, erasing its losses for the year.  Retail Sales  Stocks pared losses as a Commerce Department report showed
U.S.  retail sales  climbed 0.6 percent in May, exceeding the 0.4
percent forecast by economists in a Bloomberg survey.  The MSCI All-Country World Index advanced 20 percent from a
November low through May 21, before retreating 4.7 percent
through today.  Japan ’s Nikkei 225 entered a  bear market  as it
plunged more than 20 percent from its May 22 high.  The volume of shares traded in companies listed on the
Stoxx 600 was 9.4 percent greater than the average of the last
30 days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Shares on the Stoxx 600 rose to 13.5 times estimated
earnings on May 17 from 9 times in September 2011. That’s the
highest valuation since the end of 2009. Stocks on the index are
currently trading at 12.8 times projected earnings, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Investors have finally woken up to the fact that current
stock valuations are not supported by fundamentals in the
current low growth environment, and all the QE in the world
can’t address that particular issue,” said  Michael Hewson , a
market strategist at CMC Markets Plc in  London .  World Bank  The  World Bank  said in a report that the global economy
will expand 2.2 percent this year, less than a January forecast
for 2.4 percent growth and slower than last year’s 2.3 percent.
It lowered its projection for developing economies and said the
euro area’s gross domestic product will fall 0.6 percent.  National benchmark indexes fell in 11 of the 18 western-European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 added 0.1 percent,
 France ’s CAC 40 rose 0.1 percent, while  Germany ’s DAX lost 0.6
percent.  Greek stocks gained 3.4 percent, erasing an earlier decline
of as much as 2.6 percent, as Prime Minister Antonis Samaras’s
office said his party will meet coalition partners on June 17.
The benchmark  ASE Index (ASE)  is still heading for a 9.1 percent
weekly drop as politicians wrangled over the closure of the
state-controlled broadcaster ERT.  RBS fell 3.3 percent to 315 pence after Hester said he is
resigning later this year at the board’s request as the state-controlled British bank prepares for privatization.  RBS Cuts  Separately, RBS said in an e-mailed statement to staff that
it will cut more jobs at its investment bank as it exits its
equity derivatives and structured retail-products businesses. A
person briefed on the decision said the lender will cut about
2,000 jobs.  Home Retail tumbled 9 percent to 131.1 pence after saying
it expects  consumer spending  to remain subdued this year. Same-store sales at Argos stores rose 1.9 percent in the 13 weeks
ended June 1, missing the 3 percent-gain estimated by analysts
in a Bloomberg survey.  Financial-services companies declined, led by Jupiter Fund
Management Plc, which dropped 1.7 percent to 307.8 pence.
Aberdeen Asset Management Plc retreated 1.6 percent to 396 pence
and Deutsche Boerse AG dropped 1.3 percent to 47.94 euros.  Elan Corp. (ELN)  fell 5.2 percent to 9.29 euros after Royalty
Pharma said it may be forced to end its bid to take over the
Irish drug maker. The investor in royalty streams from
pharmaceuticals said today it believes that Elan shareholders
will back a share repurchase progam at a meeting on June 17,
requiring Royalty to withdraw its offer under an Irish Takeover
Panel ruling.  Rhoen-Klinikum gained 6.7 percent to 17.73 euros as
shareholders abolished a clause requiring a majority of 90
percent of capital represented at its annual meetings to approve
decisions. Last year’s takeover bid from Fresenius SE failed to
clear the threshold after rival Asklepios Kliniken GmbH bought a
stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
