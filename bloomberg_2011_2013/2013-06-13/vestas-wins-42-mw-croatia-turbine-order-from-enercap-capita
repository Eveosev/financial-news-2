Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  won a 42-megawatt wind-turbine order in  Croatia  from Czech developer
EnerCap Capital Partners, the second project by the companies in
two years.  The order for 14 V90 3-megawatt turbines was placed by
EnerCap’s Eko Energija developer, Aarhus, Denmark-based Vestas
said today in a  statement  on its website. They’ll be installed
in the Croatian province of Obrovac, with delivery of the first
device planned for the first quarter of 2014 and commissioning
of the plant in the second quarter, Vestas said.  Croatia plans to derive 35 percent of its energy from
renewable sources by 2020 and had a total of 180 megawatts of
wind power installed as of the end of 2012, according to the
European Wind Energy Association.  The project is at least the second by Prague-based EnerCap
to use Vestas turbines after the company last year used 11
Vestas turbines in the Scieki Wind Farm about 80 kilometers (50
miles) southwest of Warsaw. EnerCap plans for the Obrovac farm
to have a second, 12-megawatt phase, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
