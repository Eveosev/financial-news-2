Russia will ship in July 19 cargoes
of East Siberia-Pacific Ocean, or ESPO, crude from the Pacific
port of Kozmino, matching the record set in May.  Kozmino will load 1.9 million metric tons, or about 450,000
barrels a day, of ESPO blend, according to a final loading
program obtained by  Bloomberg News . Three of the shipments,
which are in lots of 100,000 tons each, will be transported by
rail from Skovorodino and the rest through the pipeline’s second
phase.  Russia’s most expensive infrastructure project, the ESPO
pipeline, starts at fields in east Siberia. A second phase of
the venture was completed in December that expanded the
pipeline’s capacity and also extended the link to the Pacific
coast, at Kozmino, lessening the need for rail shipments.  The July program also includes a partial rail cargo of
82,000 tons that will be topped up at Kozmino in August.  OAO Lukoil is slotted to ship its first cargo of ESPO crude
ever from June 30 to July 1, pending inclusion on the Energy
Ministry’s export schedule, according to the program.  Seven of the July cargoes are from OAO Rosneft, six lots
will be from OAO Surgutneftegas, OAO Gazprom Neft will get two,
with the remaining three are earmarked for smaller producers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
