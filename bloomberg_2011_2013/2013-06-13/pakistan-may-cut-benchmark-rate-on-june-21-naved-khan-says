Naved Khan, chief executive officer
of Faysal Bank Ltd., a Pakistani lender, comments on the central
bank’s interest rate decision scheduled for June 21. He spoke in
an interview in Karachi.  On monetary policy meeting:  “The market has already priced in a 50 basis points cut in
the  interest rate . Nawaz Sharif’s governments have always had
two priorities; lower interest rates and a stable exchange rate.  Inflation is showing a downward  slope . By virtue of this,
there is room being built in for a cut. However, the central
bank showed signs in the last statement that they don’t want to
ease because of balance of payments pressure.”  On bond proposal to settle energy sector debt:  “It’s still circular debt if it’s turned into bank debt or
government paper. It does not resolve the issue. The issue is
how to decrease the speed of rising circular debt. There are two
ways out, changing the industrial mix or selling electricity at
cost. People will come out if prices are increased and energy
mix will take at least three years to change.”  On tax collection:  “Beating a dead horse every time by increasing taxes will
not resolve your issue, he won’t run faster.  We need some
draconian steps.”  On outlook for bank profits:  “Margins are already under pressure. I see this being a
very difficult year. I think the big five banks will be hit the
most. If I can grow or be where I am I would say I am lucky.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
