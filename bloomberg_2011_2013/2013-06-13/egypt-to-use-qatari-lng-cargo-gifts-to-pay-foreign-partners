Egypt  will use five Qatari liquefied
natural gas cargoes it receives as gifts to pay its foreign
partners under a previously announced gas-swap deal, an Egyptian
Oil Ministry official said.  Under the agreement, international  oil companies  in Egypt
started supplying natural gas in mid-May in return for Qatari
LNG shipments to be exported to the companies’ clients, Tamer
Heikel said today by telephone from Cairo.  Egypt, the Arab world’s most populous nation, is struggling
to meet rocketing household and industrial demand for energy
amid a slowdown in oil and gas exploration and production
following an uprising in 2011. It is also facing financing
difficulties, with foreign-exchange reserves down by more than
half from December 2010 levels.  Egyptian General Petroleum Corp. Chairman Tarek Elbarkatawy
said on June 10 that Qatar planned to donate the cargoes from
the end of July until mid-September. Each cargo would be 3.2
billion cubic feet and valued at $30 million to $40 million,
depending on the  price index , he said.  “The gift cargoes are just to help us save time until the
conclusion of bank procedures for the rest of the cargoes” in
the 18-cargo swap deal, Heikel said today.  Elbarkatawy had said in a May 8 interview that the gas-swap
deal involves 18 to 24 cargoes of Qatari LNG that would be
provided in lieu of gas supplied by  BG Group Plc (BG/)  and Petroliam
Nasional Bhd to the Egyptian government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
