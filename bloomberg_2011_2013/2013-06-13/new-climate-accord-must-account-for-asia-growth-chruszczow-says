A new global climate-protection
agreement must be flexible enough to account for a growing share
of the world’s greenhouse-gas emissions being produced in  Asia ,
a senior Polish climate official said.  With 50 percent of global manufacturing capacity expected
to move to Asia in the next 20 years, a new climate treaty
scheduled to be ready by 2015 needs to take into account that
future responsibility for emissions is shifting, Tomasz Chruszczow, Poland’s special envoy for  climate change , said
yesterday in an interview in Bonn.  “That’s why this new agreement needs to be flexible enough
and forward-looking enough,” Chruszczow said. “It’s time to
apply the rule of equity, of common but differentiated
responsibility based on respective capabilities, in a different
manner.”  More than 190 nations are trying to draft a successor to
the  Kyoto Protocol , the only United National pact that sets
binding emissions-reduction targets. Parties to the UN-administered talks will meet in Warsaw in November, in  Lima ,
Peru, in late 2014 and in Paris in 2015, where a treaty is
scheduled to be agreed.  The  Kyoto Protocol  divides nations into two groups:
developed countries with binding reduction targets, and
 developing countries , which may take voluntary actions.  “Continuing this distinction won’t save the world,”
Chruszczow said. “For the future, what is hapening in these
emerging economies like China, Indonesia, will have a major
impact on global climate.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
