Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A)  is providing more data about claims costs at insurance
units after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission pressed
the company for the information.  We “agree to provide disclosures in future filings of the
significant catastrophe losses for our insurance group as a
whole and for each of our underwriting units to the extent that
such losses are significant,” Marc Hamburg, chief financial
officer of Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire, said in a letter to
the SEC that was dated April 25 and released today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
