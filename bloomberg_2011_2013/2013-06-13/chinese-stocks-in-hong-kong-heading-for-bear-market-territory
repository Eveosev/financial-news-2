A  gauge  of Chinese stocks in Hong
Kong fell 20 percent from its high for the year after the  World
Bank  cut its global growth forecast and investors mulled the
outlook for monetary stimulus.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  sank 3 percent to
9,666.03 as of 9:37 a.m. in Hong Kong, extending losses from a
Feb. 1 high to 21 percent, exceeding the 20 percent threshold
considered by some investors as defining a bear market. The Hang
Seng Index slid 2.5 percent to 20,824.91.  To contact the reporter on this story:
