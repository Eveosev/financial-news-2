Nestle Nigeria Plc (NESTLE) , the West African
nation’s largest food company by market value, headed for its
largest retreat on record as investors sold shares on
speculation the stock was overvalued, FBN Capital Ltd said.  The stock fell for a second day, sliding as much as 10
percent, the most on a closing basis since at least Jan. 25,
2002, when Bloomberg started compiling the data. It traded 7
percent lower at 930.01 naira by 1:26 p.m. in Lagos,  Nigeria ’s
commercial capital. About 1.7 times the three-month daily
average volume of shares were traded.  Nestle Nigeria’s shares jumped in May, pushing its
relative-strength index above 70, an indication to some traders
that the stock may be overbought. The level dropped to 35.6
today as the shares’ decline over the past five trading days
extended to 16 percent, the  fourth-worst  performer on the
 Nigerian Stock Exchange ’s All Share Index.  “There is a general selloff after the price rally,” Bunmi Asaolu, an analyst at Lagos-based FBN Capital, said today by
phone. “Our target price for the stock is 852 naira, based on
 cash flow .”  Nestle Nigeria said on May 3 net income for the three
months through March declined to 5.99 billion naira ($37
million) from 6.2 billion naira a year earlier. Revenue rose to
30.7 billion naira from 28.7 billion naira, it said.  The company’s shares rose 29 percent this year, in line
with a 29 percent gain in the all-share gauge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
