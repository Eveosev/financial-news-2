Inventories in the U.S. increased in
April as sales declined for a second month, showing companies
may limit orders to manufacturers.  Stockpiles (MTIBCHNG)  rose 0.3 percent in April after a revised 0.1
percent decline that was initially reported as little changed,
Commerce Department figures showed today in Washington. The
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey called for a 0.3 percent
advance. Sales fell 0.1 percent after dropping 1.2 percent.  Businesses had enough items on hand to last 1.31 months at
the current sales pace in April, the highest since October 2009
and indicating factory production may cool as companies work off
excess stock.  The median  forecast  for business inventories was based on a
Bloomberg survey of 48 economists. Estimates ranged from a 0.2
percent decline to a gain of 0.5 percent.  In May,  retail sales  rose more than forecast, showing job
gains and lower borrowing costs are encouraging consumers to
spend, according to another Commerce Department report today.  The 0.6 percent increase was the biggest in three months.
The  median  forecast of 83 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
called for a 0.4 percent advance.  Retailers’ stockpiles, the only part of today’s inventory
report not previously released, climbed 0.4 percent in April.
Sales were unchanged. The inventory-to-sales ratio for retailers
rose to 1.41 months in April from 1.4 months.  Excluding auto dealers, retailer stockpiles also increased
0.4 percent.  Progress on reducing joblessness may support consumers’
willingness to spend. The number of Americans  filing claims  for
jobless benefits decreased by 12,000 to 334,000 in the week
ended June 8, a Labor Department report showed today.  Factory inventories climbed 0.2 percent in April as sales
dropped 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
