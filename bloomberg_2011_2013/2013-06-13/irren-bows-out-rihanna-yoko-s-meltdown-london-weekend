Rihanna, Yoko Ono’s meltdown, and Helen Mirren’s closing act as the Queen are our choices for  London  this weekend.  STAGE  Queen Elizabeth II stoops to wipe a corgi’s wet back as her grouchy prime minister Harold Wilson watches.  This weekend is your last chance to see this and other charming tableaux in “The Audience,” starring Helen Mirren. Her Majesty is shown having (imagined) weekly audiences with a her prime ministers, including the bumbling John Major and the bossy Margaret Thatcher (in pinstripes and stiff hair).  If you’re ticket-less and dying to see Dame Helen, bang a large drum outside the theater. Last month, a group of street percussionists got an earful from the actress in full regalia.  Ends June 15 at the Gielgud Theatre. Information:  http://www.theaudienceplay.com  or call +44-844-482-5130.  DINING  Did you expect to get through this column with no mention of Father’s Day? Several  London restaurants  have special menus for that special day (Sunday). At Le Pont de la Tour, it’s 27.50 pounds ($43.11) for three courses. If you book dinner, there’s a free bottle of wine to take home. Information:  http://www.lepontdelatour.co.uk/  or +44-20-7403-8403.  Five Fields is a new Chelsea restaurant named after the 18th-century London area where it’s located. The herbs and vegetables are grown in the establishment’s own gardens in East Sussex. Chef-owner Taylor Bonnyman previously worked at Corton in New York, while head chef Marguerite Keogh was at Marcus Wareing at the Berkeley:  http://www.fivefieldsrestaurant.com  or call +44-20-7838-1082.  VISUAL ARTS  German Chancellor Angela Merkel is contemporary art’s new bugbear.  In his Tate Britain exhibition, artist Gary Hume pictures her as a green blob with a predatory yellow mouth. The painting-on-aluminum was produced in 2011, when Merkel was unloved in some euro member countries. Also on show is a 2002 bas-relief of Kate Moss’s face with Michael Jackson’s nostrils; it’s a satire on celebrity that, with Jackson now dead, looks slightly eerie.  Nextdoor is an exhibition of pop artist Patrick Caulfield, who hated to be called that. See his cheery trompe l’oeils of lakeside views and chicken kievs. Both shows end Sept. 1:  http://www.tate.org.uk  or call +44-20-7887-8888.  MUSIC  David Bowie, Elvis Costello and Jarvis Cocker all did it. Now it’s Yoko Ono’s turn to curate the Meltdown festival at the Southbank Centre.
