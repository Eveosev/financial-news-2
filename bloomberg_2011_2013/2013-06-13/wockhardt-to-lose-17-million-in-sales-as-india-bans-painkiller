Wockhardt Ltd. (WPL) , an Indian maker of
insulin and hepatitis vaccines, will lose about 4 percent of its
revenue after the nation banned sales of a painkiller.  Mumbai-based Wockhardt in the 12 months to April earned 970
million rupees ($16.7 million) from  sales  of Proxyvon, the brand
under which it sold formulations of the painkiller
dextropropoxyphene, according to data from AIOCD AWACS, a market
research firm. Wockhardt had 91 percent of the Indian market for
the drug, data show.  India  last month halted sales of formulations containing
the opioid pain reliever  banned  in  Europe  in 2009 and the U.S.
in 2010 after data showed that the drug causes toxicity to the
heart. The latest ban follows restrictions on exports of drugs
to the U.S. from one of Wockhardt’s plants.  Wockhardt’s  shares  have fallen 34 percent this year, making
it the second-worst performing stock in the S&P BSE India
Healthcare Index. The stock rose 0.6 percent to 1,041.65 rupees
in Mumbai. The company’s local unit reported sales of 24.7
billion rupees in the 12 months to March.  Daryl Suchita, a spokesman for Wockhardt, didn’t
immediately comment on the ban when contacted at his office.  The U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  last month placed
import restrictions on the company’s Waluj facility in
Aurangabad because the section that makes injectable drugs
didn’t meet its current good manufacturing practices.  Wockhardt will lose about $100 million in revenue as a
result of the import alert in the year ending March 2014,
Chairman Habil Khorakiwala said in a call with analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
