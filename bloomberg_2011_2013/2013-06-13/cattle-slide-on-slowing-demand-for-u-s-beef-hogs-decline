Cattle futures decline for the
second straight day on signs of weakening demand for U.S. beef.
Hog prices also dropped.  Meatpackers processed 366,000 cattle in the first three
days of this week, down 1.6 percent from a week earlier and 4.4
percent lower than the same period in 2012, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show. Wholesale  beef  prices have slumped 4.5
percent since reaching $2.1137 on May 23, the highest since at
least January 2004, government data show.  “Beef prices kind of hit a peak, and they’ve been
dropping,” Dick Quiter, an account executive at McFarland
Commodities LLC, said in a telephone interview from Chicago.
“It just seems like demand hasn’t been maybe as good as people
thought.”  Cattle futures for August delivery dropped 0.2 percent to
$1.19275 a pound at 10:18 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Prices were down 9.7 percent this year through
