European Union nations reached a
provisional deal on a sweeping overhaul of the bloc’s financial
market rulebook that would toughen oversight of high-frequency
trading and push more transactions onto regulated platforms.  Ambassadors from the EU’s 27 nations overcame obstacles to
an accord at meetings yesterday and today in Brussels, according
to EU and national officials.  The draft plans, which must also be approved by the
European Parliament to take effect, are set to be detailed and
reviewed over the coming days so a deal can be confirmed
following talks on June 17, according to the two officials, who
can’t be cited by name, in line with their organizations’
policy.  Ireland, whose EU presidency runs out on June 30, urged
countries this month to accept “difficult compromises” for the
sake of an accord on the law, which triggered clashes between
the U.K. and  Germany  over provisions to boost competition in the
market for clearing derivatives trades. Ireland is targeting a
deal on the law next week, according to a spokeswoman for the
presidency, who can’t be identified under government rules.  The updated law would regulate activities from investment
advice to speculation with commodity derivatives and rules on
management of trading platforms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
