Dong Energy A/S said a new hybrid
security designed to replace a 3010 bond that lost its equity
content after a  Standard & Poor’s  rule change will be offered at
450 basis points over the 10-year euro mid-swap rate.  The swap rate will be determined on June 19, the company
said in a statement to the stock exchange today.  Dong said June 10 it will ask holders of its 7.75 percent
junior subordinated 700 million euro ($924 million) 3010 hybrid
bond to swap into the new security after S&P cut the old bonds
equity content to zero from 100 percent. The new bond is a 500
million-euro hybrid, offered at 104 percent of the 3010 hybrid’s
face value.  Dong Chief Financial Officer Carsten Krogsgaard Thomsen
said this week the swap terms represent a “compromise” after
the company struggled to adjust its  capital structure  to S&P’s
new rules. Dong could have called the bond at 101, he said. The
utility, which spent months designing the 3010 note to fulfill
S&P specifications, says it has been assured the new note will
provide it with 50 percent equity, helping restore its loss-absorbing buffers.  Dong is trying to get its capital structure in place as the
Danish government prepares to sell an equity stake of at least 6
billion kroner ($1.06 billion) in the company, Krogsgaard
Thomsen said this week.  S&P said June 10 it was affirming Dong Energy at BBB+, with
a negative outlook, after the company announced its planned bond
exchange.  “We believe that the proposed hybrid capital would largely
mitigate the negative impact on  Dong Energy ’s credit measures
following our re-evaluation of the equity content in the
existing hybrid instrument,” S&P said. “The negative outlook
reflects our view that Dong Energy could find it difficult to
improve its financial risk profile to a level commensurate with
the current rating over the next 12-18 months.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
