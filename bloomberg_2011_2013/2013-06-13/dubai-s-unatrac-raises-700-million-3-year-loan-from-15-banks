Unatrac Holding Ltd., a Dubai-based
dealer of  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  machinery, raised a $700 million loan
from a group of 15 banks for working capital and to repay debt.  The three-year revolving credit facility pays interest at
400 basis points, or 4 percentage points, more than the London
interbank offered rate, the company said in an e-mailed
statement.  Barclays Plc (BARC) , Citigroup Inc and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) 
arranged the financing.  The company, owned by the Mansour family, increased the
loan from $600 million after Unatrac received offers for almost
twice that amount, according to the statement. In a revolving
credit facility, money can be borrowed again after it is repaid.  The other banks in the syndicate are Caterpillar Financial
Services (Dubai) Ltd, Commercial International Bank ( Egypt ) SAE,
HSBC Bank Middle East Ltd., Mashreqbank PSC, Qatar National Bank
Group acting through Commercial Bank International PSC and
National Société Générale Bank SAE, Standard Bank Group Ltd.,
First Gulf Bank PJSC, Standard Chartered Plc, Abu Dhabi
Commercial Bank PJSC, Commercial Bank of Dubai PSC and Bank Audi
SAL.  To contact the reporter on this story:
