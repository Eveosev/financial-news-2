Gasoline rose as U.S. retail sales
increased in May and storms in the Midwest caused units to shut
at a refinery serving the  Chicago  area. Crack spreads widened.  Futures advanced as May  retail sales  rose 0.6 percent, the
biggest jump in three months, Commerce Department data showed
today. Citgo Petroleum Corp.’s Lemont,  Illinois ,  refinery  lost
power to production units after a lightning strike yesterday.
Pump prices in the Chicago area were $4.399 a gallon, 76.7 cents
a gallon above the national average, according to data from AAA,
the largest U.S. motoring organization.  “Gasoline got a bounce from the economic data and from
Citgo,” said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures
Group in Chicago. “The Midwest is like a horror story.”  Gasoline for July delivery rose 1.69 cents, or 0.6 percent,
