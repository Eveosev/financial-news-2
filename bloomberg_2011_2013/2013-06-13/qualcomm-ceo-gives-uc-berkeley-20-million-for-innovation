The  University of California ,
Berkeley, received $20 million from the foundation of  Paul Jacobs , chairman and chief executive officer of  Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) ,
to establish an innovation institute.  The funds from the Paul and Stacy Jacobs Foundation will
let Berkeley’s College of Engineering plan the institute’s
educational agenda and expand the role of design in engineering
education, according to a  statement  on the website of the
Berkeley, California-based university.  “Manufacturing will be a key focus of our proposed Jacobs
Institute for Design Innovation,” Shankar Sastry, dean of the
College of Engineering, said in the statement. “We want to
provide our student innovators with opportunities to scale up
their inventions and produce them efficiently and sustainably.”  Berkeley is conducting a  drive  to raise $3 billion to
support its students, faculty, research and other programs by
the end of 2013. Paul and Stacy Jacobs, who each hold three
degrees from Berkeley, are both co-chairs of the campaign.  To contact the reporter on this story:
