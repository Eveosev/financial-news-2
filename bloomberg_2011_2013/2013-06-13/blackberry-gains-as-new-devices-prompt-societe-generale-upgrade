BlackBerry (BBRY)  rose the most in almost
three months after Societe Generale SA boosted its rating on the
stock to buy from sell, saying channel checks show the Canadian
smartphone maker’s new devices are selling well.  The shares gained 6.3 percent to $14.42 at the close in New
York, the biggest jump since March 20. The stock has climbed 21
percent this year.  BlackBerry is seeking to revive sales after losing market
share to  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone and  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) ’s
Galaxy devices. This year the company introduced the Z10, which
has a touch-screen, and the Q10, which targets BlackBerry
loyalists with a physical keyboard.  “Our base case scenario now assumes that the new handset
sales have been faster than we previously assumed,” Andy Perkins, a Societe Generale analyst, wrote.  Societe Generale forecasts Z10 sales of more than 4 million
in the fiscal first quarter, up from 1 million in the prior
period. Q10 devices could reach almost 1 million, according to
an investor note.  First-quarter revenue may be $3.7 billion, up from $2.7
billion in the prior period, he said. That compares with an
average analyst estimate of $3.4 billion, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Samsung accounted for a third of smartphone sales last
quarter, while Apple had 17 percent, according to IDC. Waterloo,
Ontario-based BlackBerry saw its share fall to 3.2 percent in
the fourth quarter, before the company dropped out of the top
five in this this year.  BlackBerry is scheduled to report earnings on June 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
