The  Chicago Blackhawks  rallied from
a two-goal deficit in the third period and beat the Boston
Bruins 4-3 in triple overtime in the first game of the  National
Hockey League ’s Stanley Cup Final.  Brandon Saad,  Dave Bolland  and Johnny Oduya scored for the
Blackhawks in regulation play at United Center in  Chicago . The
winning goal came 52 minutes, eight seconds into overtime as
Michal Rozsival’s shot was deflected first by Bolland and then
by Andrew Shaw into the net.  Game 2 in the best-of-seven series is scheduled for the
same venue on June 15.  The series pits the 2010 champion against the following
year’s Stanley Cup recipient. The Blackhawks ended a 49-year
wait for a fourth NHL title three years ago and the Bruins
snapped a 39-year gap between titles when they claimed a sixth
championship in 2011.  The longest game in Stanley Cup Final history also featured
the Bruins, who lost 3-2 to the Edmonton Oilers in Game 1 of the
1990 edition to a goal after 55:13 of overtime.  Milan Lucic got the first goal after 13 minutes, 11 seconds
and added a second for Boston 51 seconds into the second period.  After Saad got one back for the Blackhawks 2:17 later, the
Bruins moved 3-1 ahead as  Patrice Bergeron  scored on a power
play 6:09 into the third period.  Bolland got a goal for the Blackhawks less than two minutes
later and Oduya tied it with 7:46 to play in the third.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
