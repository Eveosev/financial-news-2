Treasuries gained the most in more
than three months as traders said speculation that the  Federal
Reserve  could disclose plans to slow its bond-buying program as
soon as at next week’s policy meeting was overblown.  Yields (USGG10YR)  on benchmark 10-year notes fell for the first time
in three days. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  has repeatedly said
a reduction in the central bank’s $85 billion in monthly bond
purchases wouldn’t mean an end to record easing. Ten-year notes
have dropped the past six weeks, the longest losing stretch
since 2009.  “The market could have overreacted to tapering, and this
brings us back to solid ground,” said Justin Lederer, an
interest-rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald LP in  New York ,
one of 21 primary dealers that were required to bid at today’s
$13 billion 30-year bond auction.  U.S. 10-year  yields  slid eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 2.15 percent at 5 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The drop is the largest
since Feb. 25. The price of the 1.75 percent security due in May
2023 gained 22/32, or $6.88 per $1,000 face amount, to 96 14/32.  Thirty-year (USGG30YR)  bond yields decreased five basis points to 3.32
percent even after today’s auction attracted lower-than-average
demand.  Yield Surge  Ten- and 30-year yields have reached 14-month highs since
May as investors weighed whether the economy is  strengthening 
enough for policy makers to consider reducing bond purchases
that have been used to keep borrowing rates low. Bernanke told
Congress May 22 the Fed could start scaling back bond buying at
its “next few meetings” if the U.S. employment outlook shows
sustainable improvement.  The Fed bought $3.29 billion of Treasuries today due from
August 2020 to February 2023 after investors submitted $8.19
billion of the securities for sale.  The central bank “was getting perhaps a bit concerned
about the pace of interest-rate increases via the Treasury
market,” said  Christopher Sullivan , who oversees $2.1 billion
as chief investment officer at United Nations Federal Credit
Union in New York. “They thought it prudent to cap those rates
here because likely the underlying expansion of the economy
couldn’t withstand those increases.”  The 10-year note yield will end the year at 2.35 percent,
according to the median forecast of 76 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. That’s up from a 2.20 percent forecast in a similar
survey last month.  Bond Auction  Today’s auction of 30-year bonds drew a  yield  of 3.355
percent, the highest since March 2012, compared with a forecast
of 3.324 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of eight of the
Fed’s 21 primary dealers.  The  bid-to-cover ratio , which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities that were offered, was
2.47, versus an average of 2.58 for the previous 10 sales.  “There is concern about whether investors want to take
much risk in general ahead of the FOMC next week,” said Michael Pond, head of global inflation-linked research at Barclays Plc,
referring to the policy-setting  Federal Open Market Committee .
As a primary dealer, Barclays is obligated to bid at U.S.
government debt auctions.  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 40.2 percent of the bonds, compared
with an average of 36.7 percent for the past 10 sales.  Falling Demand  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 8.5 percent of
the securities, compared with an average of 13.8 percent at the
past 10 auctions.  Yesterday’s $21 billion sale of 10-year notes drew a  bid-to-cover  ratio of 2.53, the lowest since August.  At an auction
of $32 billion in three-year notes on June 11, the  ratio  was
2.95, the least since December 2010.  The government said it will sell $7 billion in 30-year
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities on June 20.  A gauge of traders’ inflation outlook reached the lowest
since January 2012. The  difference  between yields on U.S. 10-year notes and same-maturity inflation-indexed securities shrank
to as little as 2 percentage points. The gap, known as the 10-year break-even rate, signals expectations for consumer prices
over the life of the debt. It reached a 2013 high of 2.61
percentage points on Feb. 4.  Haven Demand  Treasuries gained earlier as investors sought refuge after
the  World Bank  lowered its forecast for global growth amid
concern central banks are considering easing stimulus measures.
The World Bank pared projections yesterday for economic
expansion in 2013 to 2.2 percent from a January estimate of 2.4
percent.  Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 6.4 percent, and the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index of stocks dropped 2.2 percent. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 1.3 percent after declining
0.3 percent.  The  Bank of Japan  refrained at a policy meeting this week
from adding to its stimulus program after announcing in April it
would double monthly debt purchases to achieve 2 percent
inflation. While the  European Central Bank  kept its key interest
rate unchanged at 0.5 percent on June 6, it didn’t announce
additional stimulus.  “The No. 1 thing that today’s market shows you is that
Treasuries remain an international asset class,” said Ira Jersey, an  interest-rate  strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in
New York, a primary dealer. “When you have global angst in
risky assets, even if the U.S. isn’t doing that badly, people
still move to Treasuries to find a safe haven.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
