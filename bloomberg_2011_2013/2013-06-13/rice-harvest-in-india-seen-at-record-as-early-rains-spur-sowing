Rice output in  India , the world’s
second-largest grower, is set to climb to a record as early
arrival of monsoon rains over the biggest growing regions spurs
planting, potentially boosting exports.  The monsoon crop may increase 2.4 percent to 95 million
metric tons from 92.75 million tons a year earlier, said P.
Chengal Reddy, secretary general of the Consortium of Indian
Farmers Associations. The rain-fed crop is planted from June and
harvested from October and accounts for almost 90 percent of the
nation’s total production.  A bigger harvest may help India retain its position as the
top  exporter  and further lower global food costs tracked by the
 United Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization, which fell in
May for the first time in four months. While rice prices are
poised for a third year of gains in Chicago, corn and wheat have
tumbled into bear markets after surging last year when the worst
drought since the 1930s wilted crops in the U.S.  “Given the forecast for a normal monsoon, the area under
rice will certainly be more than last year,” Trilochan
Mohapatra, director of the  Central Rice Research Institute , said
in a phone interview from Delhi. “The production of rice is
going to exceed” last season’s levels, he said.  Farmers have sown rice in 523,000 hectares (1.29 million
acres) as of June 7, compared with 622,000 hectares a year
earlier, according to data from the  Agriculture Ministry . The
monsoon, which accounts for more than 70 percent of the
country’s annual rainfall, covered  Andhra Pradesh  and West
Bengal states a day earlier than normal, according to the  India
Meteorological Department .  Exportable Surplus  Showers have been  23 percent more  than a 50-year average
since June 1, with Andhra Pradesh getting at least 70 percent
more rains, bureau data showed. Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal
are the nation’s top growers, representing about 29 percent of
the crop.  India may continue to export as a normal monsoon and
reserves of 33.3 million tons will leave enough for shipments,
Angel Commodities Broking Pvt.  said  June 10. Exports totaled
10.25 million tons in 2012, according to the  Foreign
Agricultural Service  of the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  Rough rice for delivery in July was little changed at
$16.28 per 100 pounds on the Chicago Board of Trade at 2 p.m. in
Mumbai. Futures have advanced 7.3 percent this year after
gaining in the past two years. Global rice production may expand
to 470 million tons in 2012-2013 from 466 million tons a year
earlier, according to the International Grains Council.  “We have asked farmers to increase use of hybrid seeds,”
Mohapatra said. The high-yielding varieties can boost output by
about 1 ton per hectare compared with the normal varieties, he
said. Farmers planted about 39 million hectares under rice
during the monsoon season in 2012-2013, the farm ministry says.  To contact the reporters on this story:
