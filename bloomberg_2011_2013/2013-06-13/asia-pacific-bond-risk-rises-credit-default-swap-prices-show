The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
rose, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  increased 2 basis points to 142.5 basis
points as of 08:39 a.m. in  Singapore ,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) 
prices show. The gauge is set for its highest close since Sept.
26, according to data-provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index jumped 3.5 basis points
higher to 103 basis points as of 9:21 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup
Inc. prices show. The measure is headed for its highest level
since April 4, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill
Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private
market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 2 basis points to
132 as of 10:20 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac prices. The
benchmark is set to close at its highest level since Nov. 28,
CMA data show.  “We expect continued volatility until we get a more stable
U.S. rates environment and ultimately a clearer picture on QE
tapering,” said Glenn Hodgeman, global head of credit trading
at Westpac.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
