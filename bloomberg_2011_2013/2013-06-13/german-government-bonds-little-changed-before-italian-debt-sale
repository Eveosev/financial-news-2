German  government bonds  rose, with
10-year bunds advancing for a third day, after the  World Bank 
cut its global-growth forecast and a slide in Asian stocks
spurred investors to seek safer assets.  Austrian and Dutch securities gained with other so-called
semi-core securities amid concern the  Federal Reserve  is moving
toward reducing its program of monetary stimulus, known as
quantitative easing. Italian bonds swung between gains and
losses after the nation’s borrowing costs rose as it sold 7.83
billion euros ($10.4 billion) of debt. Greek 10-year securities
gained for the first time in seven days.  “The risk-off tone is now to such an extent that we’re
seeing falls in yields in the AAA regions,” said Elwin de Groot, senior market economist at Rabobank Nederland in Utrecht,
the Netherlands. “Initially it was really the fear of QE
tapering. Now it’s more the second-round effect of this
volatility in the market. The fear is that this may also sap the
economic recovery at some stage.”  Germany ’s benchmark 10-year  yield  fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 1.57 percent at 4:52 p.m.  London  time
after climbing to 1.66 percent on June 11, the highest level
since Feb. 20. The 1.5 percent bund due in May 2023 rose 0.21,
or 2.10 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 99.435.  Austria ’s  10-year yield  declined three basis points to 1.98
percent and similar-maturity Dutch rates dropped three basis
points to 1.94 percent.  World Bank  The World Bank lowered its global growth forecast for next
year to 2.2 percent from its January estimate of 2.4 percent, in
a report yesterday. Fed policy makers next meet on June 18-19
after Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said May 22 the central bank
could scale back stimulus efforts should the job market show
“sustainable improvement.”  Volatility on Austrian bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of Finland and  Spain , according
to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and
10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Italy sold 3.4 billion euros of three-year notes at a yield
of 2.38 percent, up from 1.92 percent at the previous auction on
May 13. The Treasury also placed 1.5 billion euros of 15-year
bonds at a yield of 4.67 percent, and 2.9 billion euros of two
floating-rate securities due in 2018.  “Bearing in mind there were some concerns given the spike
in yields and negative news flow for the periphery in general,
this has gone well,” said  Michael Leister , an interest-rate
strategist at Commerzbank AG in London.  Italy’s  10-year yield  fell three basis points at 4.36
percent after rising as much as eight basis points and falling
up to seven basis points.  ‘Most Favorable’  Italian bonds may benefit from the funding requirements for
the rest of the year, according to UniCredit SpA.  “Italy is the country with the most favorable
liquidity/supply balance until year-end, as redemptions and
coupons will be 25 billion euros higher than supply,”
strategists led by Michael Rottmann, head of fixed-income
research in Munich, wrote in a note to clients.  Spanish 10-year bonds were little changed with the yield at
4.62 percent.  Greek bonds snapped a six-day decline. The yield fell 31
basis points to 10.05 percent after earlier climbing to 10.80
percent, the highest since May 2.  Political uncertainty is  Greece  is likely to persist after
Prime Minister Antonis Samaras this week ordered the closing of
the country’s public broadcaster ERT, increasing the risk of an
early election, Nomura International Plc strategist Lefteris
Farmakis in London, wrote in an e-mailed comment.  German bonds handed investors a loss of 1.1 percent this
year through yesterday, according to the Bloomberg Germany
Sovereign Bond Index. French bonds fell 0.5 percent and Italian
securities returned 2.5 percent, separate indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
