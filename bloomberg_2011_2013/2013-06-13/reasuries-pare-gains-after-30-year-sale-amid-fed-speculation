Treasuries pared gains, pushing
yields toward 14-month highs, after demand weakened at a U.S.
sale of $13 billion of 30-year bonds amid concern the  Federal
Reserve  may reduce stimulus.  The securities drew a  yield  of 3.355 percent, the highest
since March 2012, compared with a forecast of 3.324 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of eight of the Fed’s 21 primary dealers.
Treasuries gained earlier after the  World Bank  cut its global-growth forecast yesterday amid bets central banks may back off
on stimulus, fueling haven demand. U.S. yields have climbed
since May amid wagers the  Federal Open Market Committee , which
meets June 18-19, will slow its bond buying. A gauge of the
outlook for inflation fell to the lowest since January 2012.  “There is concern about whether investors want to take
much risk in general ahead of the FOMC next week,” said Michael Pond, head of global inflation-linked research at Barclays Plc,
which as a primary dealer is obligated to bid at U.S. government
debt auctions.  The current  30-year bond  yield fell three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 3.34 percent at 1:19 p.m.  New York 
time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. It slid earlier
as much as six basis points. The yield touched 3.43 percent on
June 11, the highest since April 4, 2012.  The long-bond yield has increased from this year’s low of
2.81 percent set May 1.  Ten-year note  yields fell four basis points to 2.19 percent
after dropping as much as seven basis points earlier, the
biggest intraday decrease in a week. They reached 2.29 percent
on June 11, also the highest since April 2012.  Demand Gauge  At today’s auction, the  bid-to-cover ratio , which gauges
demand by comparing total bids with the amount of securities
that were offered, was 2.47, versus an average of 2.58 for the
previous 10 sales.  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 40.2 percent of the bonds, compared
with an average of 36.7 percent for the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 8.5 percent of
the securities, compared with an average of 13.8 percent at the
past 10 auctions.  Note Sales  A $21 billion 10-year note sale yesterday drew a  bid-to-cover  ratio of 2.53. It was the least since August. At an
auction of $32 billion in three-year notes on June 11, the  bid-to-cover  ratio was 2.95, the smallest since December 2010.
Today’s auction is the final of three sales this week of coupon-bearing debt totaling $66 billion.  Demand for Treasuries at auction has slackened this year
amid signs of improvement with the  U.S. economy . Investors have
bid $2.97 for each dollar of debt sold at the U.S. government’s
$958 billion in Treasury notes and bonds through yesterday,
compared with a record bid-to-cover ratio of $3.15 set in 2012,
according to Treasury data compiled by Bloomberg.  Treasuries briefly pared gains after the Commerce
Department reported U.S.  retail sales  increased 0.6 percent in
May, more than forecast, and the Labor Department said jobless-benefit claims dropped last week by 12,000 to 334,000.  Even amid signs of stronger economic growth, the  difference 
between yields on 10-year notes and same-maturity inflation-indexed securities shrank today to as little as 2 percentage
points, the least since January 2012. The gap, known as the 10-year break-even rate, is a gauge of traders’ expectations for
consumer prices over the life of the debt. It reached a 2013
high of 2.61 percentage points on Feb. 4.  TIPS Sale  The U.S. said today it will sell $7 billion in 30-year
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities on June 20.  Fed policy makers meet June 18-19 as investors weigh
whether the economy is strengthening enough for Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  to consider reducing bond purchases that have been used
to keep borrowing rates low.  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities each month to put downward pressure on
borrowing costs and spur economic growth. It will slow the
purchases to $65 billion a month at its October meeting,
economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast last week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
