Dwr Cymru Welsh Water, which
provides water and wastewater treatment services to 3 million
people, said Finance Director Chris Jones will succeed Nigel
Annett as chief executive officer effective Sept. 1.  The sixth-largest regulated water and sewer company in
England and Wales said today in a statement that it invested 338
million pounds ($529 million) in projects and infrastructure
upgrades across Wales, Hereford and Deeside the past 12 months,
29 percent more than a year earlier.  About 650 million pounds more will be invested over the
next two years, Welsh Water said. Glas Cymru, which acquired Dwr
Cymru Welsh Water in 2001, has the highest credit rating in the
U.K. utilities industry and “more thank-you letters and e-mails
from customers than complaints,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
