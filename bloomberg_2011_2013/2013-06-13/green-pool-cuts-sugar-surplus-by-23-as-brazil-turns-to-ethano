The global sugar surplus will be 23
percent smaller than forecast as millers in leading producer
 Brazil  direct more cane to making ethanol at the expense of the
sweetener, according to Green Pool Commodity Specialists Pty.  Sugar supplies will be 2.89 million metric tons higher than
consumption, the Brisbane, Australia-based researcher said in
its second estimate for the 2013-14 season that starts in most
countries in October. That compares with a previous forecast of
3.75 million tons and excess supplies of 8.99 million tons in
2012-13. Millers in Brazil’s center south, the main growing
region, will direct 45.2 percent of the cane harvested to making
sugar, down from a previous estimate of 47.6 percent and last
year’s 49.4 percent.  “Ethanol obviously pays more than sugar, and it is usually
paid for more promptly than is sugar,” Tom McNeill, a director
at the company, said in a report e-mailed yesterday. “While
there is some price pressure from stronger supply, we expect
that consumption will kick in strongly for hydrous ethanol at
the pump, and steady prices.”  The price of hydrous ethanol, the pure biofuel used in
flex-fuel cars in Brazil, is about 16.50 cents a pound,
according to Green Pool. That’s 1.3 percent more than raw sugar
futures for July delivery traded on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York. Sugar production in the center south will be 34.5 million
tons, Green Pool estimates. That compares with a previous
estimate of 35.8 million tons and last year’s 34.2 million tons.  Global sugar production will fall to 177.7 million tons in
2013-14 from 181.8 million tons a year earlier as output drops
in countries including  India , the world’s second biggest grower,
and  Mexico , the company forecasts. Consumption will rise to
173.8 million tons in the 12-months started in April from 170.8
million tons a year earlier.  Indian Output  Dry weather in some of India’s main producing states will
cut the nation’s sugar output by 9.6 percent in 2013-14 from a
year earlier to 22.5 million tons, according to the report.
Production in Mexico will probably fall to 5.8 million tons from
6.5 million tons in 2012-13, Green Pool estimates.  “Mexico had very good growing conditions for its crop in
the past year, and a sharp reduction in the pest and disease
issues that usually beset the crop also helped maximise
output,” McNeill wrote. “Can that be repeated in 2013-14?
Current returns say no, and the statistical probability of two
record crops is also low in Mexico. Hence the lower forecast for
2013-14.”  In  Thailand , the second-biggest exporter, production will
rise to 10.5 million tons in 2013-14 from 10.1 million tons in
the current season, Green Pool estimates. The cane crop there
will be a record 100.1 million tons in 2012-13 even with a poor
monsoon, according to the report.  Plantings Boosted  Sugar prices have fallen 55 percent since reaching a 30-year high of 36.08 cents a pound in February 2011, as farmers
from Brazil to  China  boosted plantings. Futures, down 17 percent
in 2013 to 16.29 cents, are heading for a third year of
declines. That would mean the longest slump since 1992.  “The market is working at taking away the incentives it so
strongly provided to producers in the past two to three years,”
McNeill said. “At present, even deferred contracts are trading
at or below the cost of production of the major exporters, so
that the balance sheet must see serious rectification before the
market will trade above those levels again.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
