Eight former directors overseeing
mutual funds for Morgan Keegan & Co. settled, without paying any
penalties, U.S. regulatory claims that they allowed assets
backed by subprime mortgages to be overvalued as the housing
market collapsed in 2007.  The directors, who didn’t admit or deny the allegations,
agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing any future
violations of the Investment Company Act, the Securities and
Exchange Commission said in an administrative order filed today.  “Our settlement sends a clear warning of our commitment to
enforce the duty of mutual fund directors and trustees to
closely oversee the process of valuing securities held by their
funds,” George Canellos, co-chief of the SEC’s enforcement
division, said in a statement.  The eight directors, who were responsible for determining
fair value of fund securities that lacked readily available
market quotations, delegated valuation tasks to a committee
without providing meaningful guidance on how the assets should
be priced, the SEC said in a December administrative order
against the directors.  The directors, who were based in Alabama and  Tennessee ,
made no meaningful effort to learn how the values were being
determined and obtained almost no information explaining why
particular values were assigned to portfolio securities,
according to the order.  The action followed a related $200 million settlement with
Morgan Keegan, a subsidiary of St. Petersburg, Florida-based
 Raymond James Financial Inc. (RJF)  in 2011 and sanctions against two
employees in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
