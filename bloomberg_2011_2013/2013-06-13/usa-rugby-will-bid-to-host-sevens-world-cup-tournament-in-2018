USA Rugby will bid to host the 2018
Rugby World Cup Sevens after the sport’s governing body said the
tournament would be integrated into the Olympic Games cycle.  Board Director Will Chang, a part owner of the San
Francisco Giants baseball team, will lead the U.S. bid and visit
Moscow this month to study the Russian capital’s hosting of the
2013 edition, which is scheduled for June 28-30, Boulder,
Colorado-based USA Rugby said yesterday.  “Hosting this tournament will support our goals of
developing the game and further its popularity in the  United
States ,” Chang said in a  statement . “We are looking forward to
hearing more about the bid process and will do everything we can
to ensure the 2018 Rugby World Cup Sevens will take place on
United States soil.”  The Moscow event is the first edition of the four-yearly
championship since sevens, a fast-paced game with eight fewer
players per team than rugby union’s traditional format, was
added to the Olympics program for the 2016 games in  Rio de
Janeiro . The Dublin-based International Rugby Board said
yesterday that the next edition would take place in five years’
time in order for the tournament to be effectively integrated
into the Olympic cycle.  To contact the reporter on this story:
