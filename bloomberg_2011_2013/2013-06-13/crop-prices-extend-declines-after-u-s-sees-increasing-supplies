Soybean futures had the biggest drop
in almost three weeks on mounting speculation that the U.S., the
world’s second-biggest grower, will produce the most ever this
year. Corn fell, and wheat climbed.  Soybean output will be a record 3.39 billion bushels in the
season that starts Sept. 1, 12 percent more than a year earlier,
when crops were hurt by drought, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said yesterday. Analysts in a Bloomberg survey
expected a forecast of 3.371 billion. Inventories may more than
double from a year earlier to 265 million bushels, the USDA
said.  “Forecasts for a significant build in 2013-14 U.S. soybean
carryout could put November soybean futures in a downtrend,”
 Dan Cekander , the director of grain-market analysis at Newedge
USA LLC, said in a report. “Forecasts for five to six days of
drier weather next week across the Corn Belt could allow
increased U.S. soybean planting.”  Soybean futures for November delivery dropped 1 percent to
settle at $13.005 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest decline for a most-active contract since May
24.  Corn futures for December delivery fell 0.4 percent to
$5.3525 a bushel. Earlier, the price touched $5.29, the lowest
since May 24. The USDA forecast for domestic production was
larger than analysts forecast.  Wheat futures for July delivery rose 0.4 percent to $6.855
a bushel. Earlier, the price touched $6.75, the lowest since May
21.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, hay
and wheat, USDA data show.  Brazil  is the top oilseed producer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
