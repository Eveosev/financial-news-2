Inpex Corp. (1605) , Japan’s biggest energy
explorer, will miss its target of producing 1 million barrels of
oil equivalent a day by the end of the decade, according to
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.  Oil and gas output, which has been at about 400,000 barrels
a day for the past seven years, will climb to 500,000 by 2017
and approach 740,000 by 2020 after Inpex starts producing
condensates at Kashagan in  Kazakhstan  and the Ichthys and
Prelude liquefied natural gas fields off  Western Australia ,  Neil Beveridge , a Hong Kong-based analyst at Bernstein, said in an e-mailed report today. The Abadi gas field between Australia and
Indonesia will be approved too late to help Inpex meet its goal,
according to the report.  “Abadi should be the next major project approved, with a
final  investment decision  expected in 2014, but this is not
sufficient for Inpex to reach their long-term target,”
Beveridge said.  Kashagan, which has experienced “severe schedule delays
and massive cost over-runs,” is due to start up as late as
early 2014, according to the report. “While Inpex’s equity
share in Kashagan is only 8.5 percent, Kashagan will be a near-term driver of production growth,” Beveridge said, estimating
that the site will account for more than 6 percent of Inpex’s
production by 2015.  Inpex’s extension of the Mahakam production sharing
contract, or PSC, in east Kalimantan, Indonesia, beyond 2017
when it expires is “not a foregone conclusion,” Bernstein said
in the report. “While we do not expect the Indonesian
government to let the PSC lapse, we do expect a relinquishment
of up to 50 percent of equity to Pertamina as part of the terms
for further extension.”  Inpex and  Total SA (FP)  have been developing the project since
1970 and Japan is a major buyer of LNG from the Bontang plant,
which gets supply from Mahakam, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
