 U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said he’s optimistic lawmakers and the Obama administration
will agree to overhaul the nation’s immigration system and
invest in infrastructure.  Lew, speaking at the  Clinton Global Initiative  America
meeting in Chicago today, said immigration reform is critical to
the U.S. economy, which showed resilience during the global
financial crisis and is growing at about 2 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
