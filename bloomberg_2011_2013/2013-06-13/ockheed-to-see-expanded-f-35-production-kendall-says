The Pentagon’s chief weapons buyer
says production of  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) ’s F-35 fighter will
increase in fiscal 2015 beyond the 29 being purchased this year,
barring unexpected setbacks.  “We are coming up on the decision this fall,”  Frank Kendall, the Pentagon’s undersecretary for acquisition, told
reporters today on a telephone conference call during a visit to
Lockheed’s F-35 plant in  Fort Worth ,  Texas . “Unless there is a
significant surprise, I think we will able to raise production”
in fiscal 2015, he said.  The production rate is planned to remain at 29 in fiscal
2014, which begins Oct. 1, and then increase to 42 planes in
fiscal 2015, 62 in 2016, 76 in 2017 and 100 in 2018, according
to internal Pentagon budget documents.  Kendall has voiced increasing optimism about the F-35, the
Pentagon’s costliest weapons system, since a $500 million drop
in projected costs for retrofitting aircraft already built and a
1.1 percent decline reported last month in the program’s
estimated total cost.  Even with the improvements, the $391.2 billion projected
cost to develop and build 2,443 jets for the Air Force, Navy and
Marine Corps has increased 68 percent since the Pentagon signed
its initial contract for the fighter with Lockheed in 2001.  The development program is now performing “close to
plan,” Kendall said. Schedule delays in several areas are “not
dramatic,” he said.  “I am encouraged by the progress, but there still is a
great deal of work to be done,” he said. The program is about
40 percent through its flight-test plan, with “a fair amount”
of the most difficult software testing ahead, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
