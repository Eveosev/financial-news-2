South African corn declined for a
second day after a report from the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  showed more production than anticipated.  White corn for delivery in July fell 0.3 percent to 2,316
rand ($233) a metric ton by the midday close on the South
African Futures Exchange. The yellow variety for delivery in the
same month lost 0.3 percent to 2,287.40 rand a ton.  The USDA forecast corn output in the U.S., the world’s
biggest producer, at 14.005 billion bushels, compared with the
average estimate of 13.82 billion in a Bloomberg survey of
analysts.  A stronger rand contributed to the declines, said Andrew Fletcher, an independent trader in Kroonstad in the Free State
province of  South Africa . The country’s currency strengthened
after the  World Bank  cut its forecast for global economic
growth, easing concern central banks are preparing to curtail
monetary stimulus.  Meal made from white corn is a staple food in South Africa
and the yellow variety is mainly used as  animal feed  in the
continent’s largest producer of the grain.  Wheat for delivery in July dropped 0.8 percent to 3,570
rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
