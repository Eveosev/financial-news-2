(Corrects dividend target payout ratio in fifth
paragraph.)  Suncorp Group Ltd. (SUN) , an Australian
lender and insurer, sold A$1.6 billion ($1.5 billion) of loans
to  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  at a discount and said it expects
its non-core portfolio to incur a loss in the second half.  The loans were sold at 60 cents for every dollar and the
company expects to reduce its non core portfolio by a further
A$700 million in the next two months to a remaining total of
A$500 million, it said in a statement. Suncorp said it expects
the portfolio to lose as much A$490 million in the second half.  Brisbane-based Suncorp has struggled with sour loans
largely exposed to the property sector. It set up a non-core
bank in 2009 with an A$18 billion portfolio and Chief Executive
Officer Patrick Snowball has focused on exiting the loans. By
Dec. 31, Suncorp had reduced the portfolio to A$3.4 billion,
freeing up A$420 million in capital, according to the statement.  “With the portfolio below A$3 billion, the Group balance
sheet in great shape and a general improvement in funding and
capital markets now was the time to act,” Snowball said in the
statement.  Suncorp said it would consider a dividend above its target
payout ratio of 60 to 80 percent of cash earnings for the year
to June 30, 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
