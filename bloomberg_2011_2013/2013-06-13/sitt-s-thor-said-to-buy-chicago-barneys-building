Thor Equities LLC, the real estate
company headed by Joseph Sitt, agreed to buy a  Chicago  building
that’s home to a luxury Barneys New York store for $155 million,
a person with knowledge of the deal said.  Thor, based in New York, is purchasing the property from
Israeli investor Nochi Dankner, according to the person, who
asked not to be identified because the details are private. The
six-story building, located at 15 East Oak St. in the city’s
high-end  Gold Coast  shopping district, houses a Fred’s
restaurant in addition to the Barneys store.  Stefan Friedman, a Thor spokesman, declined to comment on
the transaction. A message left for Dankner at his Tel Aviv
office after regular business hours wasn’t immediately returned.  Thor, owner of seven properties on Manhattan’s Fifth
Avenue, is a real estate development, leasing and management
company. In Chicago, it owns the Palmer House Hilton hotel and
four properties on South State Street, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
