Google Inc. (GOOG)  says it has detected and
blocked attempts from within  Iran  to steal the e-mail account
details for tens of thousands of Iranians ahead of the country’s
presidential election this week.  The activities have been disrupted for the past three
weeks, Google said.  “The timing and targeting of the campaigns suggest that
the attacks are politically motivated in connection with the
Iranian presidential election on Friday,” the Internet-service
provider said in a  statement  yesterday. The phishing attack
directed users to “a fake Google sign-in page that will steal
their username and password.”  Iranians will vote tomorrow for a replacement to President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the first such election in four years. The
last poll erupted into street protests after the declaration of
Ahmadinejad’s victory. Political opponents and protesters said
the outcome resulted from ballot rigging.  E-mails and social media accounts were a key tool for the
2009 protests. The demonstrations lasted for days before they
were suppressed by the Iranian authorities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
