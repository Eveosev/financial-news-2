Italian borrowing costs rose at
auction on signs that central banks will refrain from adding
more stimulus to bolster global growth.  Italy  sold 3.4 billion euros ($4.5 billion) of 2.25 percent
2016 bonds at 2.38 percent, the highest since a sale of
comparable maturity bonds on March 13 and up from 1.92 percent
at the last auction May 13. Investors bid 1.34 times the amount
of the three-year bond offered, the same as last month.  Italian yields climbed to the highest in more than two
months on June 11 after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  told German television the previous day that ECB debt
buying will only be used to target bond prices that are out of
line with fundamentals. Today’s auction comes after Italy sold
one-year bills yesterday at the highest rate since March 12.  The Rome-based Treasury today also sold longer-term  debt ,
placing 1.5 billion euros of 4.75 percent 2028 bonds to yield
4.67 percent and 2.9 billion euros of two floating-rate 2018
bonds. Altogether, Italy sold 7.83 billion euros of debt, near
the 8 billion-euro maximum target for the auction.  Italy’s 10-year bond yield dropped 2 basis points to 4.37
percent after the sale at 12:05 p.m. in Rome, pushing the
difference with comparable German bunds to 281 basis points.  Further Volatility  “Although we expect further volatility in cross-country
spreads going forward, we rule out another massive widening
movement,” Annalisa Piazza, a fixed-income analyst at Newedge
Group in  London , wrote in a note to clients after the sale.
Fundamentals “wouldn’t justify such a move, now that Italy has
a relatively stable government that is driving the country in
the direction of structural reforms and a smooth transition”
out of the recession in the past few quarters.  With the country’s economy probably mired in its eighth
quarter of recession and unemployment at a 36-year high of 12
percent in April, Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta has called
for European Union policy to focus more on growth and job
creation and less on austerity.  The economy and labor ministers of Italy,  France ,  Germany 
and  Spain  will gather in Rome tomorrow to discuss a common
strategy before the June 27-28 EU summit that will focus on
youth unemployment. Letta’s administration has also pledged to
cut labor taxes and review a controversial property tax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
