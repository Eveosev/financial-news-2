Robusta coffee fell for a fifth day
in London to a 17 month-low, with speculators betting on lower
prices just as dry weather helps speed the harvest in  Indonesia 
and rainfall in  Vietnam  favors crop development. Cocoa slid.  Money managers more than  tripled bets  on falling prices of
robusta coffee traded in London in the week ended June 4, NYSE
Liffe data showed. Southern Sumatra, Indonesia’s main coffee-growing region, will get drier weather this week, favoring
harvesting, MDA Weather Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , said
in a report on June 11. Vietnam’s main growing area of  Dak Lak 
will get rain in the 10 days through June 20, the Meteorology
and Hydrology Department forecast this week.  “Another round of beneficial rain was seen in the central
highlands of Vietnam,” alleviating concerns about drought,
Sterling Smith, a futures specialist at Citigroup Inc. in
 Chicago , said in a report e-mailed yesterday. Robusta is falling
on speculation supply will grow and as “hopes of increased
Asian demand thus far have been slow to develop.”  Robusta coffee for September delivery retreated 1.7 percent
to $1,749 a metric ton by 11:18 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London.
Earlier, the price fell to $1,741 a ton, the lowest for a most-active contract since Jan. 9, 2012. Arabica coffee for September
delivery slid 0.4 percent to $1.24 a pound on ICE Futures U.S.
in  New York .  Futures trading volumes on ICE were more than triple the
average for the past 100 days for this time of day, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Money managers boosted their net-short positions, or wagers
on a lower market, to 7,096 futures and options in the week
ended June 4, the Commitments of Traders report published on the
exchange’s website on June 10 showed. That compares with 2,029
contracts a week earlier and it’s the biggest net-short position
since Jan. 17, 2012, exchange data on Bloomberg showed.  White, or refined, sugar for delivery in August added 0.4
percent to $477 a ton in London. Raw sugar for delivery in
October was 0.2 percent higher at 16.61 cents a pound in New
York.  Cocoa for delivery in July was down 2.1 percent at 1,516
