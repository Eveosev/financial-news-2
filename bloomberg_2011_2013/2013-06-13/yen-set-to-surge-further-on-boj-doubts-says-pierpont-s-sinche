The yen will strengthen further as
Japanese investors, disappointed with the Bank of  Japan ’s
monetary-easing efforts, retreat from foreign investments,
according to Robert Sinche of Pierpont Securities Holdings.  “The BOJ hoped that buying government bonds in Japan would
encourage Japanese investors to move money out of the yen into
foreign markets, and that would push the yen down,” Sinche,
global strategist at Pierpont in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , said
yesterday in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s
“Surveillance” with  Tom Keene . “It’s not happening.”  The currency gained 0.7 percent to 95.37 per dollar
yesterday in New York as domestic investors trimmed holdings of
overseas bonds and stocks for a fourth week. Japanese money
managers cut their holdings of foreign bonds by 386.9 billion
yen and sold a net 221.8 billion yen of overseas stocks in the
week ended June 7, according to figures released today by the
Ministry of Finance.  The yen has advanced 8 percent since touching a 4 1/2-year
low of 103.74 per dollar on May 22, the largest advance among
major currencies, as investors bet the BOJ pledge to buy more
than 7 trillion yen ($73 billion) of bonds monthly won’t be
enough to end 15 years of deflation.  “We’ve gotten a lot out of the BOJ, but I think people
keep expecting more and more and more and they’re not getting
more,” said Sinche. “We’ve had some disappointments about how
quickly they’re going to announce these other plans in terms of
restructuring and revitalizing the economy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
