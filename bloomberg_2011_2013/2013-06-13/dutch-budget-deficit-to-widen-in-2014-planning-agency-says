The Dutch budget deficit will widen
in 2014 as the outlook for the economy remains weak, CPB, the
government’s planning agency, said.  The deficit will hit 3.7 percent of  gross domestic product 
in 2014, The Hague-based CPB said in a  statement  yesterday. In
February, it forecast a deficit of 3.4 percent. It sees a
deficit of 3.5 percent in 2013.  “The international and Dutch economies look gloomy,” CPB
said. “Growth of world trade is historically slow, as is GDP in
the eurozone. The only positive factor is that the economy seems
to be shrinking at a slower rate.”  Prime Minister  Mark Rutte ’s coalition government is trying
to narrow its budget gap with a four-year, 16 billion-euro
($21.4 billion) austerity package on which agreement was reached
in October. The Cabinet will decide in August on additional
measures needed to meet the 3 percent limit in 2014.  The planning agency also revised downward its economic
outlook. It forecasts GDP will decline 1 percent in 2013 while
it sees a growth of 1 percent in 2014. Unemployment is forecast
to increase to 7 percent in 2014.  European Union Commissioner Olli Rehn and Dutch Finance
Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem said in  The Hague  on June 11 that
around 6 billion euros ($8 billion) of austerity is necessary in
2014 to get the  budget deficit  within the EU’s limit of 3
percent of gross domestic product.  To contact the reporter on this story:
