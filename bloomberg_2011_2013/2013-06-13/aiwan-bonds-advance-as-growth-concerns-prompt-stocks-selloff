Taiwan ’s bonds advanced, with five-year yields dropping the most in a week, as concerns that
China’s economic growth is slowing prompted investors to seek
safety in government debt. The local dollar rose.  Global funds sold $153 million more Taiwanese stocks than
they bought on June 11, taking net sales this month to $1.1
billion, according to exchange data. The World Bank yesterday
cut its 2013 growth forecast for developing countries to 5.1
percent from a January estimate of 5.5 percent estimated in
January. The projection for China, Taiwan’s biggest trade
partner, was lowered to 7.7 percent from 8.4 percent.  “The five-year bonds are reacting to the selloff in
stocks, as we see banks buying,” said Baker Tu, a bond trader
at Capital Securities Corp. in Taipei. “It’s not really
surprising that  China ’s economy has taken a turn for the worse,
but it’s starting to have a real impact on the markets.”  The yield on the 0.875 percent notes due January 2018
dropped two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, from June 11
to 0.99 percent as of 10:48 a.m. in Taipei, according to Gretai
Securities Market prices. The decline is the biggest since June
6. Taiwan’s financial markets were shut for a public holiday
yesterday.  Taiwan Dollar  The Taiwan dollar rose, snapping two days of declines that
followed central-bank intervention to curb its strength. The
currency rose 0.73 percent to NT$29.94 against its U.S.
counterpart, Taipei Forex Inc. prices show.  The central bank has sold the currency in the run-up to the
close on most days in the past year, according to traders who
asked not to be identified. The local dollar was trading 0.5
percent stronger one minute before the 4 p.m. close on June 11
and finished 0.3 percent weaker.  One-month non-deliverable forwards retreated 0.3 percent to
NT$29.94 against the greenback, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected
moves in the exchange rate used to price options, climbed 11
basis points to 5.08 percent.  The  overnight interbank lending  rate was steady at 0.388
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
