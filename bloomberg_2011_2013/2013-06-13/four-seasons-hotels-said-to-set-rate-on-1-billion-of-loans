Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts , the
luxury hotelier, set the rates on $1 billion of loans itâ€™s
seeking, according to a person with knowledge of the
transaction.  The financing includes a $750 million first-lien term loan
that will pay interest at 3.5 percentage points to 3.75
percentage points more than the London interbank offered rate,
said the person, who asked not to be identified because the deal
is private.  The company also is seeking a $250 million second-lien term
loan with a margin of 6 percentage points to 6.25 percentage
points, said the person. Both pieces of the bank debt would have
a 1 percent floor on Libor.  Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG are arranging the
financing, according to a second person with knowledge of the
deal.  The seven-year first-lien loan may be sold to investors at
99 cents on the dollar and the 7 1/2-year second-lien portion at
a discount of 98 cents, the person said.  Lenders will receive 101 soft-call protection during the
first six months for the first-lien loan, meaning the company
would have to pay a 1 cent premium to reprice the debt in that
period, said the person.  Four Seasons  will have to pay a 2 cent premium to reprice
the second-lien loan during the first year, and a 1 cent premium
to do so in the second.  Investors are asked to let the banks know by June 20
whether they will participate in the deal, according to the
person.  To contact the reporter on this story:
