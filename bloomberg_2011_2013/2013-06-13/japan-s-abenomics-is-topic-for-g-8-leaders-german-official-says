Japan’s effort to  fight deflation 
and spur growth will be a topic at next week’s Group of Eight
summit as leaders debate divergent policies in the world’s
biggest economies, a German government official said.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and Japanese Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe plan to meet privately on June 17 during the
conference at Lough Erne in  Northern Ireland , according to the
official, who briefed reporters in Berlin on condition of
anonymity today because G-8 preparatory talks are private.  Economic-policy aides to the heads of the eight leading
economies are debating the differing approaches in monetary
policy among the G-8 nations and it’s too early to tell to what
extent the leaders will discuss the matter during the June 17-18
meeting in the U.K., the official said.  Merkel is leading euro-area calls for debt reduction and
has expressed concern about monetary easing in Japan, where
Abe’s economic program, dubbed Abenomics, includes $102 billion
in stimulus spending in a bid to end two decades of stagnation.
The  Bank of Japan  said April 4 it will purchase 7.5 trillion yen
($80 billion) of bonds a month to double the country’s monetary
base by the end of 2014.  Japan’s approach under Abe, who took office in December,
differs from what’s traditional in  Germany , the official said.
Germany will have to make it clear that the  European Central
Bank  is committed to monetary stability and is independent, he
said.  The G-8 comprises Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan
Russia, the U.K. and the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
