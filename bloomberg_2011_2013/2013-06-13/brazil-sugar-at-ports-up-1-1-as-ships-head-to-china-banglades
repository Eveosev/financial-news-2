The amount of sugar awaiting loading
at ports in top producer Brazil rose 1.1 percent in a week as
vessels head for  China ,  Bangladesh ,  India  and Egypt, according
to Williams Servicos Maritimos Ltda.  Sugar waiting to be loaded onto ships at Recife, Maceio,
Vitoria, Paranagua and Santos, the country’s biggest port,
totaled 1.62 million metric tons, figures e-mailed yesterday
from the Recife, Brazil-based shipping agency showed. That
compares with about 1.6 million tons a week earlier.  Vessels scheduled to go to China were set to take 229,500
tons of the sweetener, while those bound for Bangladesh would
carry 180,500 tons, the data show. Ships headed for India, the
world’s second-biggest producer and top consumer, were set to
take 90,000 tons and Egypt 72,050 tons.  China was the world’s biggest raw sugar importer last
season and  Indonesia  is forecast to be the top buyer this year.
India has been importing raw sugar to refine and re-export.  Raw sugar for delivery in October was 0.1 percent lower at
16.55 cents a pound by 5:19 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
