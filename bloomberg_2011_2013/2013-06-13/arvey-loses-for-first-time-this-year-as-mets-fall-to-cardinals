Matt Harvey suffered his first loss
of the Major League Baseball season as the  New York Mets  fell to
the St. Louis Cardinals 2-1 this afternoon at Citi Field.  Harvey, 24, allowed one run over seven innings,
surrendering five hits and striking out seven. He entered the
game 5-0 for the season and had not lost in his previous 14
starts dating to September. New York has averaged less than
three runs per game in Harvey’s last nine starts.  The Cardinals took a 1-0 lead in the third inning on a run-scoring triple from Matt Carpenter. They stretched the lead to
2-0 off New York relief pitcher Scott Rice.  Marlon Byrd homered with one out in the ninth inning for
New York’s lone run. John Buck followed with a double but the
Mets were unable to tie the game as Kirk Nieuwenhuis grounded
out and Josh Satin struck out.  Adam Wainwright (10-3) pitched seven shutout innings to
record the victory and become baseball’s first 10-game winner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
