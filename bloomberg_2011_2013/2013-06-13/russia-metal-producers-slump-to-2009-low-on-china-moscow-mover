Russia ’s metal producers dropped to
the lowest level since 2009 on concern economic growth in  China 
is slowing, curbing demand for commodities.  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, the world’s biggest producer of the
metal, lost as much as 4.2 percent, trading down 2.4 percent at
4,360 rubles by 3:06 p.m. in Moscow, the lowest since December
2009 on a closing basis. OAO Novolipetsk Steel slid 1.2 percent
to 41.40 rubles, the weakest level since April that year, after
dropping as much as 4 percent. OAO Severstal, Russia’s second-largest steelmaker, tumbled 2 percent to 212.40 rubles, the
lowest since November 2009.  Morgan Stanley cut its 2013 gross domestic product forecast
for China today, joining banks from  UBS AG (UBS)  to Barclays Plc,
after a weaker expansion in exports, industrial output and new
lending last month. Most metals, including nickel and copper,
retreated in  London .  “Metal producers are pricing in concerns about the
deceleration of Chinese growth,”  Mikhail Stiskin , an analyst at
Sberbank CIB in Moscow, said by phone. “Commodity prices have
returned to 2009 levels.”  Nickel fell 0.8 percent to $14,155, the seventh day of
declines and the lowest intraday level since July 2009. Steel
has lost 49 percent over the last 12 months and trades at $155.  NLMK’s global depositary receipts declined as much as 5.4
percent in London, falling 1.7 percent to $13.02. Severstal
dropped 1.3 percent to $6.645.  To contact the reporter on this story:
