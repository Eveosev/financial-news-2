Light-distillate stockpiles fell to
the lowest level in more than nine months in  Singapore , Asia’s
largest oil-trading and storage center, according to a unit of
the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Inventories including naphtha, gasoline and reformate
dropped 1.8 million barrels, or 18 percent, the biggest decline
in more than seven months, to 8.3 million in the seven days
ended yesterday,  International Enterprise Singapore  said today
in an e-mailed statement. That’s the lowest since the week ended
Aug. 29.  Residual-fuel inventories including fuel oil and low-sulfur
waxy residue and excluding bitumen rose by 68,000 barrels, or
0.3 percent, to 22.4 million, according to the data. Supplies
rose for a third week to the highest level since the week ended
Dec. 5.  Middle-distillate stockpiles including gasoil, or diesel,
and kerosene remained at 10.2 million barrels, the highest since
May 1, according to the data.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
