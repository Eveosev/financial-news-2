European Union finance ministers are
expected to sign off next week on regulations to combat fraud
related to value-added taxes after nations reached agreement in
Brussels yesterday, an EU official said.  Governments ironed out a deal on how and when to allow
reverse charges on VAT, a  consumption tax  usually paid by
purchasers, the official said. Fraud is a particular concern for
mobile phones, tablet computers, gas, electricity and cereals
and other industrial crops.  EU leaders called on finance ministers to adopt the anti-VAT-fraud measures “by the end of June 2013 at the latest” as
part of a  10-point plan  to crack down on  tax avoidance . A U.K.-
backed compromise aimed to overcome an impasse on who makes
decisions on taking action when fraud is suspected.  The anti-fraud proposal has two elements: a “quick
reaction mechanism” to address new cases; and a “reverse
charges mechanism” that can change the way the tax is
collected. The final compromise builds on a proposal from the
U.K. and will allow nations to act after a one-month review by
the European Commission, under the condition that the reverse
charges gain unanimous support from all EU countries within nine
months.  The agreement means finance ministers may sign off on the
plan without further debate when they meet on June 21 in
Luxembourg. Ireland, which holds the EU’s rotating
administrative presidency, looks forward to presenting the
package for approval, said a spokesperson who asked not to be
named in line with government policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
