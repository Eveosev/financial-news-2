JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  Chief Risk
Officer  John Hogan  is returning to the bank in a new role after
taking almost five months off and may decide to leave the firm
altogether later this year or next, Chief Executive Officer
 Jamie Dimon  told employees in a memo today.  Hogan will return to Dimon’s operating committee and assume
a newly created job as chairman of risk while interim CRO Ashley Bacon takes over in a permanent capacity starting next week,
Dimon said in the memo. Bacon will also join the operating
committee, he said.  “John plans to carry out this important transition for
several months,” Dimon said. “We then hope he will stay at the
firm in another senior role, but he may choose to do something
different outside of our company.”  A copy of the memo was obtained by  Bloomberg News , and its 
contents were confirmed by  Joe Evangelisti , a spokesman for the 
New York-based company.  Dimon said Hogan “did a superb job as head of risk when we
needed him most” and that he respects Hogan’s decision to
return to the bank in a different role. Hogan took leave in
January for personal reasons.  “We’re very glad to have John back -- his judgment and
candor make all of us better,” Dimon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
