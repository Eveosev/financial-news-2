The forint strengthened for a third
day and bonds surged after  Hungary  raised more debt than
planned.  The currency appreciated 0.8 percent to 293.68 per euro by
3:40 p.m. in Budapest, the highest in more than a week. The Debt
Management Agency sold 55 billion forint ($249 million) in bonds
due in 2016, 2018 and 2022 -- 17 billion forint more than
planned. Investors demanded more than three times as much debt
as the amount sold, compared with a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.3
two weeks ago, data from the agency on Bloomberg show.  Yields on Hungary’s benchmark 10-year bonds fell after
reaching a two-month high this week, dropping nine basis points
to 6.12 percent today. The forint weakened to a six-week low on
June 11 as concern the U.S. Federal Reserve may cut bond
purchases reduced demand for riskier assets. Investor bets that
Hungary’s central bank will extend 10 months of interest rate
cuts fell to the lowest in a year.  “The auction went well, which was a relief for the
market,” Andras Sovany, a Budapest-based trader at ING Groep
NV, wrote by e-mail. “After the big volatility in recent days
it was a good sign that bids reappeared.”  The agency sold an additional 20 billion forint in a later,
non-competitive tender. Yields on the three-year notes jumped to
5.18 percent at today’s auction from 4.46 percent two weeks ago
and borrowing costs also rose on the other two maturities.  Yields on the existing three-year notes fell six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 5.19 percent in the second
day of declines.  The government is “using every opportunity to raise more
debt,” Sovany said. “This auction went well, but there is
concern that we may be past the strongest levels this year.
There are signs of a global shift away from  emerging markets  and
from bonds to equities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
