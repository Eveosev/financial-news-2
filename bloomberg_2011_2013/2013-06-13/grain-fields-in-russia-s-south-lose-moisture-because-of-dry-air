Dry air across grain-growing regions
in southern  Russia  reduced soil-moisture levels in some fields
this month, the  state weather center  said.  Dry conditions caused soil drought for some winter-grain
fields in the Volga Federal District’s Saratov area and certain
spring-grain and sunflower fields in the Orenburg region in
June’s first 10 days, the center said today on its website. The
district accounted for about 21 percent of the national crop in
2012, according to government statistics.  Rainfall in the Southern and North-Caucasus federal
districts was too light to prevent soil drought for some grain
fields in the Volgograd and Rostov regions, the center said. The
two districts grew about 35 percent of last year’s national
crop, with Volgograd and Rostov together harvesting about 12
percent, the statistics show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
