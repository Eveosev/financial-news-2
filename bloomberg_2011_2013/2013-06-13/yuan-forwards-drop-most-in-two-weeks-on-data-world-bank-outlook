Yuan  forwards fell the most in two
weeks after government data showed industrial production and
exports trailed estimates and as the  World Bank  cut its global
growth outlook.  The discount on yuan forwards to the onshore spot widened
to the most in four years today as top Dim Sum debt underwriters
predict a halt to the currency’s rise.  China ’s domestic markets
resumed trading today after a three-day holiday for the Dragon
Boat Festival. The World Bank reduced its growth forecast for
the world economy to 2.2 percent from a January estimate of 2.4
percent, while Morgan Stanley cut its 2013 projection for
China’s expansion to 7.6 percent from 8.2 percent.  “Yuan appreciation pressure is easing on dollar strength
and the tougher growth outlook,” said Kenix Lai, a Hong Kong-based foreign-exchange analyst at Bank of East Asia Ltd. “The
authorities are likely to pause gains to help revive growth.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards declined 0.31 percent
to 6.2870 per dollar as of 4:34 p.m. in  Hong Kong , a 2.44
percent  discount  to the onshore spot, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. That’s the biggest gap since February 2009.  In  Shanghai , the currency closed at 6.1344 per dollar,
little changed from last week’s 6.1335, according to China
Foreign Exchange Trade System prices. The spot rate touched
6.1429 earlier, the lowest since May 16. The yuan is
outperforming Asia’s most-traded currencies this quarter, with
an appreciation of 1.2 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. All of the 10 other major exchange rates have
declined.  The People’s Bank of China raised the yuan’s  daily
reference rate  by 0.01 percent to a record 6.1612 per dollar
today. The spot is allowed to diverge a maximum 1 percent on
either side of the fixing.  Slowing Economy  China released trade and manufacturing data that showed
industrial output growth slowed to 9.2 percent from a year
earlier in May, less than the 9.4 percent forecast in a
Bloomberg survey of economists. Exports rose the least in 10
months. Chinese President Xi Jinping completed a two-day summit
with U.S. President  Barack Obama  in  California  on June 8.  “With the Xi-Obama meetings over, there’s less incentive
for China to have a stronger yuan in the near future as
political pressure would have eased for now,” Lai said.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan gained 0.04
percent to 6.1403 per dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  One-month implied volatility in the onshore yuan, a measure
of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.9
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
