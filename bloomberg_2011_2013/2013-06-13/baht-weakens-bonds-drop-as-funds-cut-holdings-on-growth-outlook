Thailand ’s baht traded 0.4 percent
off a nine-month low and government bonds dropped as overseas
investors reduced holdings of the nation’s assets amid a
worsening global economic outlook.  The  World Bank  cut its 2013 growth forecast for  developing
countries  to 5.1 percent from a January estimate of 5.5 percent
and lowered China to 7.7 percent from 8.4 percent, according to
a report yesterday. China is Thailand’s biggest export market
after purchasing 12 percent of total shipments in the first four
months of the year. International investors sold $1.1 billion
more Thai equities than they bought this month and pulled a net
$205 million from bonds, official data show.  “The weakening currency discourages foreign investors from
the nation’s stocks and bonds,” said  Yuji Kameoka , chief
foreign-exchange strategist at Daiwa Securities Co. in Tokyo.
“The impact from China’s slowdown is quite large on Asia
through its exports, while growth concerns are leading to risk-off sentiment.”  The baht declined 0.5 percent to 31.08 per dollar as of
9:22 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It touched 31.19 yesterday, the weakest level since Sept. 7.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, climbed nine basis points
to 7.36 percent, a level last seen in December 2011.  Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong said yesterday that
fund outflows from Thailand may be a positive factor, helping to
weaken the baht. The currency has dropped 8.1 percent since
reaching its strongest level since 1997 in April.  Further weakness in the currency may accelerate foreign
sales of Thai equities, Maybank Kim Eng Securities (Thailand)
Pcl, the nation’s biggest stock brokerage, said in a research
note today. The  SET (SET)  Index has lost 6.3 percent in the last two
days and closed yesterday at its lowest since January.  The yield on 3.625 percent government bonds due June 2023
rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 4.02 percent,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s the highest level for a
benchmark  note  of that maturity since August 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
