Miller Barber, who made a record
1,297 combined starts on the U.S. PGA and Champions golf tours
and won 35 titles, has died at the age of 82, the  PGA Tour  said.  “He was a wonderful player who made his mark on the PGA
Tour with 11 victories and then really excelled on the Champions
Tour, becoming one of its best players in the tour’s formative
years,” PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem said yesterday in a
 statement . “Golf has lost a great man and competitor.”  Barber made 694 starts on the PGA Tour and 603 starts on
the Champions Tour, winning 24 times. He ranks fourth on the
Champions Tour wins list behind Hale Irwin (45), Lee Trevino (29)
and Gil Morgan (25), and won at least one Champions Tour event
for nine consecutive years from 1981-89.  Barber came closest to winning a major championship in 1969
at the  U.S. Open , holding a three-shot lead after three rounds
at the Champions Club in Houston before bogeying five of his
first eight holes and shooting a 78 in the final round to finish
sixth, three strokes behind winner Orville Moody.  To contact the reporter on this story:
