AllianceBernstein Holding LP (AB)  is
buying the riskiest slice of a commercial-mortgage bond
transaction for the first time as sales soar of debt tied to
skyscrapers, hotels and shopping centers.  The investment manager is teaming with Raith Capital
Partners, a New York-based real estate debt firm, in purchasing
the B-piece, designated as the first to take any losses, in an
upcoming deal from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said two people
familiar with the transaction, who asked not to be identified
because it hasn’t been announced.  Lured by higher returns with the  Federal Reserve (FDTR)  holding
benchmark  interest rates  at about zero percent since 2008,
AllianceBernstein is joining hedge funds Saba Capital Management
LP, Ellington Management Group LLC and Perella Weinberg Partners
LP in making debut B-piece purchases this year.  Investors in those portions traditionally included real
estate specialists such as Rialto Investments and Eightfold Real
Estate Capital, which last year purchased 16 of the 27 B-pieces
issued, according to data from Deutsche Bank AG.  Representatives from AllianceBernstein, Raith and Perella
didn’t immediately return telephone calls seeking comment and
spokesmen at Goldman Sachs, Saba and Ellington declined to
comment.  Sales of commercial mortgage-backed securities are poised
to climb by more than 50 percent to $70 billion in 2013,
according to Credit Suisse Group AG. Banks have arranged about
$36.6 billion this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
