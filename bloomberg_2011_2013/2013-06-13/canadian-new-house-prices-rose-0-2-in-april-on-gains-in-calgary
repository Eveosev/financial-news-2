Canada’s new home price  index  rose
0.2 percent in April on gains in Calgary,  Statistics Canada  said
today in Ottawa.  From the same month a year earlier, new home  prices 
increased 2.0 percent in April, the agency said. Economists
predicted the index would advance by 0.1 percent on the month
and 1.9 percent on the year, according to the median of six

a year earlier, the agency said. Prices in Toronto, Canada’s
