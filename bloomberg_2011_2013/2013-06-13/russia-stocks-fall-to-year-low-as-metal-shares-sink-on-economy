Russian shares dropped to the
weakest level in more than a year as metal producers slumped to
2009 lows on concern global growth may falter.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  declined 1.6 percent to 1,281.13 by 10:46
a.m. in Moscow, the lowest intraday level since June 4, 2012.
OAO GMK  Norilsk Nickel , the world’s biggest producer of the
metal, fell 3.4 percent to 4,317 rubles, the lowest since
December 2009. OAO Novolipetsk Steel retreated 3.5 percent to
40.46 rubles, the lowest since March 2009.  Stocks slumped and oil declined as the  World Bank  cut its
global growth forecast amid concern central banks may pare
monetary stimulus. The U.S. Federal Open Market Committee meets
next week after the  Bank of Japan  this week left its lending
program unchanged.  “The forecast cut is contributing to the selloff today,”
Stanislav Kopylov, who helps manage about $3 billion at UralSib
Asset Management in Moscow, said by phone today.  The dollar-denominated RTS  Index (RTSI$) , which last week entered a
 bear market , declined 1.3 percent to 1,246.88. On the Micex, 5
stocks increased while 43 dropped and two were unchanged. The
volume of shares traded on the gauge was 28 percent below the
30-day average, while 10-day price swings rose to 20.581.  Bank Rossii held its refinancing rate at 8.25 percent, the
regulator said in a statement on its website on June 10. That
matched the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 26
economists, with four predicting a quarter percentage point cut.
Inflation in  Russia  accelerated for a second month in May to the
fastest pace in 21 months, according to data last week.  Slower Growth  The rates decision means that completing an easing cycle
Bank Rossii Chairman Sergey Ignatiev announced in April will
fall to his successor, Kremlin economic aide  Elvira Nabiullina ,
who takes over June 24. The Economy Ministry lowered this year’s
growth forecast to 2.4 percent from 3.6 percent in April.  The world economy will expand 2.2 percent, less than a
January forecast for 2.4 percent growth and slower than last
year’s 2.3 percent, the World Bank said in a report released
yesterday in  Washington . It lowered its prediction for
developing economies and sees the euro region’s gross domestic
product shrinking 0.6 percent.  The Micex tumbled the most in a year on May 23, the day
after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  suggested the
central bank could curtail its bond buying if the job market
improves in a “real and sustainable way.” The Fed buys $85
billion of debt a month to support the economy by putting
downward pressure on  interest rates .  Grids Slide  President  Vladimir Putin  on June 11 ordered the government
to make proposals for lower tariff increases by June 19. OAO
Russian Grids dropped 3.7 percent to 1.004 rubles today, while
its subsidiary Federal Grid Co. retreated 2.3 percent to 9.86
kopeks.  Crude, which together with natural gas contributes about 50
percent of Russia’s budget revenue, traded down 0.4 percent at
$95.46 a barrel. Brent for July settlement fell 0.2 percent to
$103.24 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange, the second day of declines.  Urals crude , Russia’s
major export blend, added 1.1 percent to $102.74.  The 14-day Relative Strength Index on the Micex fell to 31
from 34 on June 11. A level below 30 suggests to some analysts
the shares are oversold and poised for a rebound.  The country’s equities have the cheapest valuations among
21  emerging markets  tracked by Bloomberg. The Micex trades at
4.8 times its 12-month estimated earnings, having lost 13
percent this year, compared with a multiple of 9.7 for the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index, which is down 11 percent.  The Russian Volatility Index advanced 7 percent to 31.84.
The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded Russian
companies in the U.S. fell 0.3 percent to 83.95 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
