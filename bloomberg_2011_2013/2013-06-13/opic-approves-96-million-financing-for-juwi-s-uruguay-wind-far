Overseas Private Investment Corp.
will loan renewable-energy developer Juwi AG as much as $96
million for a 50-megawatt wind farm in northeast Uruguay.  The Melowind project in Cerro Largo department will cost
about $128 million and use turbines produced by the U.S. unit of
 Germany ’s  Nordex SE (NDX1) , Nancy Payne, a spokeswoman for Washington-based OPIC, said today in an e-mail. Juwi is based in
Woerrstadt, Germany.  The project will help Uruguay reduce its dependence on
power from hydroelectric plants and fossil fuels, she said.  OPIC approved $193 million of financing for Peru’s first
large-scale wind project in March, according to the e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
