The U.S. continued its
transformation into a majority-minority nation last year, with
Census Bureau data showing non-Hispanic whites making up the
lowest percentage of the population in American history.  The  estimates  released today capture several milestones in
the country’s demographic makeup. For the first time in more
than a century, deaths outpaced births among white Americans.
Almost half, 49.9 percent, of the nation’s children younger than
5 were minorities as of July 1. And the nation’s total minority
population grew 21 times faster than whites.  Non-Hispanic whites, the nation’s predominant racial group,
added 0.09 percent last year to increase their total to 197.7
million, about 63 percent of the total population. Even with the
increase, the largest since 2008, the total number of white
deaths exceeded white births by 12,419. In 2000, whites were 69
percent of the population, and 80 percent in 1980.  “A natural decrease and eventual loss in the white
population is baked into the cake of our older white
population,” William H. Frey, senior fellow at the  Brookings
Institution , a Washington-based policy research group, said in
an e-mail. “It’s the younger, rapidly growing minority
population that will be driving economic and demographic growth
this century.”  Minorities younger than 18 are expected to overtake the
number of white children by 2019, the Census Bureau said last
year. The U.S. is projected to become a majority-minority nation
by 2043.  Natural Decrease  The Census Bureau reported that multiracial Americans were
the fastest-growing racial group last year, adding 3.1 percent
to climb to a total of 6 million. The group has only been
counted since the  2000 Census . The total estimated  U.S.
population  climbed 0.75 percent last year to 313,914,040.  Asians, who were the fastest-growing racial group from 2000
to 2010, were the second fastest-growing racial group last year,
with their ranks climbing by 2.9 percent. All minority groups,
including Hispanics, registered a 1.9 percent gain in population
from 2011 to 2012. Blacks increased their ranks by 0.9 percent.  More than 53 percent of the nation’s 3,143 counties had a
“natural decrease” in the number of whites in 2010, the latest
year for which county-level data are available, said Kenneth Johnson, a University of  New Hampshire  demographer.  “This is the first time there has ever been an overall
non-Hispanic white natural decrease in the U.S.,” Johnson wrote
in an e-mail.  Twister Fallout  Slightly more than two-thirds of U.S. counties registered a
decrease in white people from 2011 to 2012, according to census
data compiled by Bloomberg. Jasper County,  Missouri , part of the
Joplin area, lost 2.3 percent of its white population after a
2011 tornado that killed 158 people and ranks as the costliest
single twister in U.S. history.  Almost 1 percent of the white population left Nassau
County,  New York , a suburb of the nation’s largest city;
Cuyahoga County, Ohio, which includes Cleveland; and Hunterdon
County,  New Jersey , one of the wealthiest counties in the U.S.  As the growth of white Americans slowed to a crawl or
decreased in most U.S. counties, higher-than-average white
 population growth  occurred in traditionally minority areas. The
number of whites grew 4 percent in heavily Hispanic Miami-Dade
County,  Florida ; 3.1 percent in predominantly black Orleans
Parish,  Louisiana ; and 3 percent in the  District of Columbia ,
which slid to a 48.6 percent black minority from a 1970 peak of
71.1 percent majority.  Economy’s Influence  The relatively small increase in total U.S. population in
2012 was most likely due to the nation’s weak economic
performance in recent years.  “If you look at the last few years, it’s hard to tie the
slow growth to a rational argument that doesn’t involve the
economy,” John Seager, president of the  Population Connection ,
a Washington-based research organization, said in a telephone
interview. Seager said non-Hispanic whites will continue to be
the largest racial and ethnic group in the U.S. for many years
even as the nation becomes more diverse.  “I travel quite a bit, and I haven’t discerned a shocking
lack of white people anywhere,” he said. “So I don’t feel like
a beleaguered minority just yet.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
