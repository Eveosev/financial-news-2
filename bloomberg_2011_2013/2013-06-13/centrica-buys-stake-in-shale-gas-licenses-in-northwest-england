Centrica Plc (CNA) , the U.K.’s largest
energy supplier, agreed to buy a 25 percent stake in Cuadrilla
Resources Ltd.’s shale gas licenses in northwest  England .  The Windsor, U.K-based company will pay 40 million pounds
($63 million) in cash for the share in the licenses in
Lancashire, according to an e-mailed statement today. Centrica
will also pay exploration costs of as much as 60 million pounds.  The deal makes Centrica the biggest company to enter the
fledging shale industry in the U.K., where exploration was held
up after Cuadrilla’s drilling caused two earth tremors in 2011.
The company says its licenses may hold 200 trillion cubic feet
of gas. At an extraction rate of 30 percent, the maximum seen in
U.S. shale fields, that would be enough to increase U.K.
reserves more than eightfold.  “With North Sea gas reserves declining and the U.K.
becoming more dependent on imported gas supplies, it is
important that we look for opportunities to develop domestic gas
resources,” Mark Hanafin, Centrica’s managing director, said in
the statement.  Centrica will buy the stake from Cuadrilla and its partner,
Australian engineer  AJ Lucas Group Ltd. (AJL)  After the deal,
Cuadrilla will hold 56.25 percent of licenses, Centrica 25
percent and AJ Lucas 18.75 percent.  Jefferies Group LLC acted as sole financial adviser to
Cuadrilla.  Allen & Overy  was legal adviser.  To contact the reporter on this story:
