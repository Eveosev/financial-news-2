President  Barack Obama ’s
administration should release documents the U.S. and 10 other
Pacific-region nations are using as they negotiate a new trade
agreement, Democratic Senator  Elizabeth Warren  said.  In a letter to  Michael Froman , Obama’s nominee to lead the
U.S. Trade Representative’s office, the Massachusetts lawmaker
said releasing details of what is being considered by the
parties would give citizens a chance to evaluate the deal before
negotiations are completed.  “I appreciate the willingness of the USTR to make various
documents available for review by members of Congress, but I do
not believe that is a substitute for more robust public
transparency,” Warren wrote to Froman, who is now an assistant
to the president. “If transparency would lead to widespread
public opposition to a trade agreement, then that trade
agreement should not be the policy of the  United States .”  The letter, dated yesterday, was provided to Bloomberg. It
doesn’t link the request to Froman’s Senate pending
confirmation.  Froman, 50, has been nominated to lead U.S. negotiations on
the two largest trade deals in American history. U.S. officials
have said they intend to reach an agreement for the Trans-Pacific Partnership this year. That accord, with  Japan  soon to
join, would link a region that generates about $26 trillion in
annual economic output, making it the largest pact of its kind
in history. The U.S. has separately begun negotiations on a deal
with the European Union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
