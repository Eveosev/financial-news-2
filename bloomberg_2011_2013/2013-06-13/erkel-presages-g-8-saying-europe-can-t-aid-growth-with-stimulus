German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
rejected deficit spending as a way to spur growth in the euro
area, sharpening her tone before meeting with fellow leaders
from the Group of Eight nations next week.  “Some believe that growth is only possible via new state
investment programs, even if it’s done by taking up debt,”
Merkel said in a speech to the IHK German chamber of commerce
group in Berlin today. “Over a span of 40 or 50 years in
Germany, this theory didn’t turn out to be true. It didn’t work.
And there is zero evidence that it will work in future.”  Four days before the G-8 summit in the U.K., Merkel stuck
to her debt-reduction message amid soaring European youth
unemployment and a euro-area recession that Germany has avoided.
The outcry over “austerity” risks diverting  Europe  from what
it must do to overcome the debt crisis, she said.  The concept of austerity entered the German lexicon only
during the crisis and gave a sinister ring to what Europe needs:
budget restraint and structural reforms to make economies more
competitive and reduce joblessness, according to Merkel. The
word austerity sounds “like a monster,” she said.  “Growth and consolidation are not contradictory,” the
leader of Europe’s biggest economy said. “That’s why this is
the only path to overcoming the sovereign-debt crisis in the
euro region.”  Merkel, who is running for a third term in federal
elections on Sept. 22, reiterated her government’s post-election
goal of starting to pay down  Germany ’s debt. “That would be an
extremely important signal,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
