A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk declined for the first time this week as retail sales and
employment reports indicated a strengthening economy.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, decreased
1.8 basis points to a mid-price of 85.7 basis points at 9:08
a.m. in New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Investors are looking for signs of improvement in the
worldâ€™s biggest economy to help determine when the  Federal
Reserve  will begin to scale down its $85 billion monthly bond
purchases.  Retail sales  rose 0.6 percent last month after
increasing 0.1 percent in April, Commerce Department figures
showed today in  Washington . Applications for  unemployment
benefits  dropped by 12,000 to 334,000 in the week ended June 8
from 346,000 the prior period, the Labor Department reported.  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporters on this story:
