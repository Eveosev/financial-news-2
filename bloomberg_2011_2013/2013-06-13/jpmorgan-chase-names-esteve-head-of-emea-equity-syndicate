JPMorgan Chase & Co. named Manuel Esteve head of equity syndicate for Europe, the  Middle East  and
Africa, according to a memo obtained by  Bloomberg News .  Esteve succeeds Greg Chamberlain, who will become head of
the U.K. equity capital markets team, according to the memo,
which was confirmed by a spokeswoman for the New York-based
bank. Jonathan Wilcox, who has run U.K. equity capital markets,
will move to U.K. investment banking to focus on corporate
clients as a coverage banker.  Esteve previously ran the Iberia and Greece ECM team.
Francesco Cardinali will add Iberia and Greece to his current
responsibilities as head of Italy and Turkey equity capital
markets, the memo shows.  JPMorgan ranked No. 6 in managing share sales in Europe,
the Middle East and Africa this year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The U.S. bank was the sole manager of  Volkswagen
AG (VOW) â€™s 1.2 billion-euro ($1.6 billion) convertible sale earlier
this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
