EnerCap  Capital Partners , a Czech
Republic-based private equity company, plans to invest in
combined heat and power plants in central and eastern Europe as
policy changes in the region make renewables less attractive.  EnerCap plans a new fund to raise as much as 350 million
euros ($466 million) for the technology, Shane Woodroffe, a
partner at the Prague-based company, said by phone. EnerCap may
also sell assets in its 98 million-euro renewables fund with
wind farms in  Poland , Romania and the Czech Republic “in one
piece, or in two or three pieces,” he said.  EnerCap decided to focus on gas and biomass-fired CHP
projects rather than on renewable power because of “current
uncertainties” about government support for wind and solar in
countries such as  Romania  and Poland, Woodroffe said. Those
nations are seeking to reduce financial support for clean power
to stem costs to consumers.  The company has secured a pipeline of CHP projects in the
region, it said in a separate statement. CHP plants conserve
energy by using the heat created as a byproduct of making
electricity.  Woodroffe spoke as EnerCap made the final investment from
its existing EnerCap Power Fund in the first 42-megawatt phase
of a wind park in western  Croatia  slated to be the nation’s
biggest when its second 12-megawatt stage is added.  Project Finance  The Obrovac wind farm’s first phase will cost 66.7 million
euros, Woodroffe said. EnerCap won 50.6 million euros in loans
from  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  and Erste Group Bank AG to finance the
project, it said yesterday in a statement.  The debt comprises a 15-year loan from UniCredit Bank
Austria and Erste, as well as a VAT facility from UniCredit’s
Zagrebacka Banka unit. The park, which also has a guarantee from
Denmark’s export credit agency Eksport Kredit Fonden, is about
20 kilometers (12 miles) from the port of Zadar.  The first phase with 14 turbines made by  Vestas Wind
Systems A/S (VWS)  of Denmark will start operating next year, according
to EnerCap. The EnerCap Power Fund has invested in six projects
including Obrovac totaling 320 megawatts in Poland, Romania and
the  Czech Republic , according to the company.  To contact the reporters on this story:
