Ibovespa futures fell, a sign the
gauge may drop a fifth day, as commodities tumbled after the
 World Bank  cut its growth forecast for the year, dimming the
outlook for Brazilian raw-materials exporters.  Cia Paranaense de Energia  may move after the power utility
said it didn’t make an offer for bankrupt Rede Empresas de
Energia Eletrica SA’s assets.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  recommended buying
papermakers  Suzano Papel e Celulose SA (SUZB3)  and  Fibria Celulose SA. (FIBR3)   Ibovespa  futures  contracts expiring in August declined 0.5
percent to 49,020 at 9:03 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real
strengthened 0.7 percent to 2.1417 per dollar. The Standard &
Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw materials retreated 0.6 percent
after the World Bank reduced its 2013 growth estimate to 2.2
percent from a projection of 2.4 percent in January amid concern
central banks may pare stimulus.  The Ibovespa has slumped 22 percent from this year’s peak
in January on speculation accelerating inflation may curb
 Brazil ’s economic recovery and the government’s interventionist
policies will hurt profits in industries including utilities and
energy. Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge trades at 11.7 times
analysts’  earnings estimates  for the next four quarters.  Trading volume  for stocks in  Sao Paulo  was 23.6 billion
reais ($10.9 billion) yesterday, which compares with a daily
average of 7.9 billion reais this year through June 12,
according to data  compiled  by the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
