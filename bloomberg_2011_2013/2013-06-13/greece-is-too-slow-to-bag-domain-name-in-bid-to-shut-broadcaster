A bid by Greek Prime Minister
Antonis Samaras to shut down TV broadcaster ERT and replace it
with a company called Nerit was waylaid by a news blog that
claimed the domain name nerit.gr first.  The domain was registered yesterday after the government
announced the new name of the broadcaster. The government shut
down ERT on June 11 describing it as corrupt and wasteful.
Nerit, which stands for New Hellenic Radio Internet and
Television, will be modern, transparent and meet international
standards, said the government. Samaras’s coalition partners
have demanded the broadcaster reopen.  “ Nerit.gr  is not available”, the web-page of www.nerit.gr
says. Instead, the website is streaming a live feed of ERT
employees who continued to broadcast over the Internet. “It’s
not just ERT, it’s Democracy” the website said. The domain was
registered by  Troktiko , a Greek news blog.  Whois.net, a website that tracks domain name availability
listed nerit.gr as taken and hosted by webtec.gr. Staff at
WebTec, a website designer in Athens, said Troktiko registered
the domain yesterday.  The home page for Nerit.gr says the domain name is no
longer available and visitors should try “pitsaria-pou-eskise.gr,” a reference to comments by Samaras last year that
he ran a pizza shop when he lived in the U.S. while he was in
his 20s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
