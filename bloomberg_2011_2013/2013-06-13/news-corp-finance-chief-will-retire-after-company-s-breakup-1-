News Corp. (NWSA)  executive David DeVoe,
who became chief financial officer in 1990, will step down from
the position after the company splits into publishing and
entertainment entities later this month.  DeVoe, 66, will remain a director and senior adviser, News
Corp. said today in a statement. John Nallen, who has been
deputy finance chief since 2001, will take over as CFO of the
entertainment business.  On June 28, News Corp. will split into two publicly traded
companies -- a move that followed shareholder pressure to
separate the faster-growing TV and movie assets from the
publishing business. The entertainment operation will be called
21st Century Fox, while the rest will take the News Corp. name.
Bedi Ajay Singh, formerly with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., will be
CFO of the publishing company.  Nallen, who joined News Corp. in 1995, will report to Chief
Executive Officer  Rupert Murdoch  and Chief Operating Officer
 Chase Carey  at 21st Century Fox.  “I am honored to be part of 21st Century Fox’s leadership
team as we embark on an exciting next chapter to drive long-term
value for our shareholders,” Nallen said in today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
