Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) 
Chairman Walter Rothensteiner showed no sign of yielding to
investor demands to sell shares and lower dividends a week after
naming a new chief executive officer at the Austrian lender.  Rothensteiner, CEO of Raiffeisen’s 78.5 percent  owner 
Raiffeisen Zentralbank Oesterreich AG, told reporters in Vienna
that RZB was entitled to a “decent”  dividend  and reiterated he
wouldn’t agree to the sale of new shares at a significant
discount to the bank’s book value.  “There’s no question there will be a share sale at some
point,” Rothensteiner said. “But if the stock is at 25 euros
while you can calculate the  book value  at 35 or 40 euros, you’ll
only do it if it’s absolutely necessary, and before that I’ll
have to live with being criticized.”  Raiffeisen last week vowed continuity as it named veteran
Karl Sevelda as CEO to succeed Herbert Stepic, who resigned amid
a probe of his use of offshore accounts. His appointment
rekindled expectations the lender may address its capital level,
which is among the weakest among European banks if state aid and
other phased-out capital is excluded.  Raiffeisen is raising its dividend by 11 percent even as
profit declined by a quarter to 725 million euros ($965 million)
last year. No analyst predicted the increase, announced in
February, with the highest estimate being for an unchanged
payout, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. RZB also raised
its own payout, most of which goes to the eight regional mutual
banks that control it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
