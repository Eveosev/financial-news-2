European private-equity firm Cinven
LLP said it raised 5.3 billion euros ($7.1 billion) for a fifth
fund, 300 million euros more than its original target.  Cinven, the largest buyout firm dedicated solely to
investing in  Europe , began fundraising for the Fifth Cinven Fund
in 2011, holding an initial close, the point at which the
manager can begin to invest the capital, of 3 billion euros in
March 2012, the London-based firm said in a statement today.  Cinven’s ability to exceed its target comes amid a
difficult fundraising environment for private equity. Apax
Partners LLP and Permira Advisers LLP, both based in London, are
set to complete fundraising for funds smaller than their
predecessors this year, while the average time spent marketing
is now 18 months, up from 14 1/2 months in 2008, according to
data provider Preqin Ltd.  “The final closing of our Fifth Fund reflects the
confidence our investors have in Cinven’s ability to capitalize
on our sector insights and invest this fund in European-centric
businesses” Alexandra Hess, Cinven’s head of  investor
relations , said in the statement.  Cinven sold shares in U.K annuity provider Partnership
Assurance Group Plc in an initial public offering last week on
the London Stock Exchange. The deal valued the business at 1.5
billion pounds ($2.4 billion), giving Cinven a potential seven
times return on its original investment.  Investments in the new fund include Prezioso, a French-based chemicals business, and pharmaceutical companies Mercury
Pharma Group Ltd. and Amdipharm Plc, both based in the U.K.,
Cinven said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
