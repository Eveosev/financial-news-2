It’s something out of a black-and-white movie. Retreat to Marilyn Monroe’s personal lakefront bungalow, get married in the backyard, and drift off to sleep in your own private sailboat. Built in 1927, Lake Arrowhead’s “Hilltop” estate was once owned by Music Corporation of America (MCA) co-founder Jules Stein. In the years that followed, several Hollywood icons spent vacations and holidays at the 3.85-acre waterfront estate — from Cary Grant and Rock Hudson to Monroe. After first hitting the market in 2010 for $14.2 million, the current owners dropped their asking price to $9.975 million in December 2012. The price break didn’t last long, though, with a recent increase to $14.8 million. Compared with the Lake Arrowhead median list price of $360,000, the home is one of the most expensive listings in the area. But the 15,000-square-foot property at  28751 N Shore Rd, Lake Arrowhead, CA 92352  is more of a mansion than a lake house, with 10 bedrooms, 14 bathrooms, a great room, conservatory, study, caretaker’s quarters, dock house and car-collector’s showroom. The current owners commissioned a noted architect to restore the home in 2000, preserving more than 90 percent of the original construction. According to listing agent  David Vail’s website for the property , the grounds still include Monroe’s personal bungalow, known as “The Happy Hut.” In fact, nearly all of the rooms have stories behind their names. The bedrooms are named for their ceiling architecture — from the umbrella-shaped Parasol Room to the high-ceiling Loft Suite. The kids’ Bunk Room is also fitting with sailboat-converted bunk beds lining the walls. The grounds are well-kept with a tennis court and several walking trails. Listing photos show the outside space being used for weddings, with the formal garden ideal for ceremonies and the half-acre lawn for receptions.
