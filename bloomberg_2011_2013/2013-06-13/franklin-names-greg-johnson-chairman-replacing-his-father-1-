Franklin Resources Inc. (BEN) , the manager
of the Franklin and Templeton mutual funds, named  Greg Johnson 
chairman as his father Charles, 80, retires.  Greg Johnson, 51, who will continue to be chief executive
officer and president of the  San Mateo , California-based firm,
will assume the role of chairman at the close of business today,
the firm said in a statement. His father was chairman since 1999
and president and CEO from 1957 to 2003, according to  Matthew
Walsh , a spokesman for the company.  The firm was founded in 1947 by Rupert Johnson Sr., whose
two sons, Charles B. Johnson and Rupert H. Johnson Jr., still
control about one-third of the company stock. Franklin went
public in 1971 at a split-adjusted share price of 2.4 cents,
according to company data, which means one dollar invested at
the initial public offering is worth more than $6000.  Franklin, in a separate statement today, declared a three-for-one stock split to be paid in the form of a stock dividend.  Companies typically split their stock when they judge the
share price has become too high for individual investors.
Franklin’s shares returned 17 percent this year and 55 percent
over the past five years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The 20-member  Standard & Poor’s index of asset
managers and custody banks  gained 26 percent in 2013 and 10
percent over the past five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
