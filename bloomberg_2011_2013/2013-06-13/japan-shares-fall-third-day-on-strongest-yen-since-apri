Japanese  stocks  plunged, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average entering a  bear market  at the close, as
the yen rose to its strongest against the dollar in two months.
All shares on the gauge fell for the second time this year.  All 33 industry groups declined on the broader Topix index,
which sank 4.8 percent to 1,044.17 at the close in  Tokyo . The
Nikkei 225 slumped 6.4 percent to 12,445.38, its lowest since
April 3 and the third fall of more than 5 percent in the past
month. The gauge dropped 20 percent from its May 22 high,
passing the threshold some investors use to define a bear market
and wiping 42.7 trillion yen ($453 billion) from market value.
Nikkei 225 futures lost 6.3 percent in  Osaka .  “Selling breeds selling and it’s snowballing,” said Nader Naeimi, Sydney-based head of dynamic  asset allocation  at AMP
Capital Investors Ltd., which manages $126 billion. “There’s a
global sell-off in risk assets. Short term there was froth and
that needed to come out, especially in  Japan .”  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s No. 1 carmaker, was the
biggest drag on the Topix as exporters plunged. Nomura Holdings
Inc., Japan’s biggest brokerage, lost 4.9 percent as securities
companies tumbled. Nitto Boseki Co., Japan’s third-biggest
textile producer by market value, sank 9.9 percent for the
biggest fall on the Nikkei 225.  Regional shares also plummeted today, with the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index falling more than 10 percent from its recent high
on May 20, a decline some investors define as a correction.  The Hang Seng  China  Enterprises Index, a measure of Chinese
shares traded in  Hong Kong , fell more than 20 percent from its
Feb. 1 high.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index lost 10 percent from
its peak on May 14.  Volatility Surges  The Topix has swung an average of 3.4 percent daily since
May 22. The gauge’s 30-day historic volatility reached 41.54
today, its highest since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.  The yen today rose to its strongest level since April 4,
when the  Bank of Japan  unveiled a plan to buy more than 7
trillion yen ($74 billion) of bonds every month in an attempt to
secure 2 percent inflation. The Japanese currency gained to as
much as 93.79 per dollar.  Gauges tracking carmakers and consumer-electronics
producers exerted the  biggest drag  on the Topix today. Toyota,
which gets 75 percent of its sales outside of Japan, slumped 4.6
percent to 5,590 yen. Canon Inc., the world’s biggest camera
maker, lost 3.4 percent to 3,125 yen.  “Investors are worried that the yen may strengthen even
further,” said  Tomomi Yamashita , a  fund manager  who helps
oversee the equivalent of $5 billion at Shinkin Asset Management
Co. in Tokyo. “There isn’t any good material to boost the
market right now, and investors who had bought too much are
feeling uneasy and now dumping shares.”  Bond Yields  Japan’s benchmark bond yield has swung from a record low of
0.315 percent in April to as much as 1 percent since the BOJ
announced the policy. The central bank this week refrained from
adding extra policy tools to counter bond-market volatility.  Banks as a group slumped 4 percent, the third-biggest drag
on the Topix. The Topix Other Financing Business Index of
consumer lenders lost 6.3 percent, the biggest decline among the
industry groups. Nomura Holdings slid 4.9 percent to 721 yen as
all but two brokerages on the broader gauge tumbled.  The Nikkei 225 plunged on May 23 and entered a bear market
today. Shares have fallen amid a strengthening yen,
disappointment about Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s delay in
implementing a growth strategy and concern that the U.S. Federal
Reserve will scale back stimulus. The World Bank today cut its
global growth forecast as emerging-market economies led by China
slow.  “Spirits were too high before,” said  Mitsushige Akino ,
chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Asset Management Co. in Tokyo.
“Investors globally who had taken on risk in both stock and
currency markets are now having to correct their stance.”  The Nikkei 225 is still up 20 percent this year, making
Japan the world’s best-performing major equity market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
