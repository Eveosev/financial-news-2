Alpine Holding GmbH’s bonds slumped
after a newspaper reported that creditors to the Austrian
builder will decide today whether it will get the funding it
needs to continue operating.  Alpine’s 100 million euros ($133 million) of notes due May
2017 slumped 18 cents to 33 cents on the euro, the lowest since
the securities were sold in May 2012, according to German
Exchange prices. The company’s 90 million euros of June 16 notes
dropped 17 cents to 36 cents, while its bonds due July 2015
tumbled 10 cents to 48 cents on the euro, the prices show.
The Salzburg, Austria-based builder owned by Spain’s  Fomento de
Construcciones y Contratas SA  said last week reviewed its
business plan after the sale of three subsidiaries was delayed.
The company is seeking to raise at least 100 million euros by
selling assets as part of a restructuring plan agreed to in
March.  Alpine suffered a pretax loss of 90 million euros in the
first quarter, 53 million euros worse originally projected, due
to bad weather and restructuring costs, it said on June 4.  Johannes Gfrerer, a spokesman for Alpine, confirmed
creditors are meeting with company representatives today. He
declined to comment on the amount of funding needed.  FCC needs to provide Alpine with as much as 400 million
euros to continue operations,  Austria ’s Kurier newspaper
reported today, citing unidentified people in “bank circles.”  Michael Mauritz , a spokesman for Erste Group Bank AG, one
of Alpine’s banks, said today in an e-mail that creditors
convened a “regular meeting.” He declined to elaborate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
