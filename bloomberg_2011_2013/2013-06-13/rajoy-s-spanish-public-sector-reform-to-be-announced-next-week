Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy 
plans to disclose his government’s plan to reform the public
sector next week.  Rajoy will present a report on revamping the civil service
on June 19, according to a document seen by  Bloomberg News . The
Spanish government created a commission in November to propose
ways to reduce the public sector and make it more efficient.  The plan is part of government efforts to reduce the budget
deficit of 10.6 percent of gross domestic product. That’s the
widest in the European Union, more than three times the limit
set for all members.  To contact the reporter on this story:
