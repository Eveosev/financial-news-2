Mexican regulators made progress on
a plan to redefine area codes so that phone carriers such as
 America Movil SAB (AMXL)  have to charge local prices instead of heftier
long-distance fees.  The decision would cut the number of area codes to 172 from
397, the Federal Telecommunications Commission said today in a
 statement . The agency altered and resubmitted the plan to the
Federal Commission for Regulatory Improvement, which must sign
off on it before it can become official.  Mexican officials have been seeking to reduce area codes
for several years, meeting opposition from America Movil, which
said previous plans were designed to favor its competitors. The
phone agency is running out of time to implement the plan
because it is due to be replaced by a new government body under
a law signed this week by President Enrique Pena Nieto.  Long-distance minutes by America Movil’s landline phone
customers jumped 21 percent last year from 2011 even as total
lines fell 4 percent. That was partly because  government-mandated reductions in other types of fees made it cheaper to
make phone calls.  A press official at  Mexico  City-based America Movil, which
has about 80 percent of Mexico’s landlines and 70 percent of
mobile phone subscriptions, declined to comment. America Movil
 slipped  1 percent to 12.73 pesos at the close in Mexico City.  To contact the reporter on this story:
