Swedish companies have become more
optimistic even as production and sales have remained
“relatively” unchanged over the past quarter, according to a
central bank survey.  “Orders in the manufacturing sector have increased and
more companies in manufacturing, as well as construction and the
retail trade, have plans to increase their workforces in the
near term,” the Riksbank said today in a statement, citing
interviews with Swedish companies.  Sweden ’s central bank at its last meeting in April delayed
plans for its  next interest rate increase  until late next year
after cutting its inflation forecasts. It kept its main lending
rate at 1 percent for a second meeting as concerns over record-high  household debt  limited the scope for more cuts.  “Price pressures in the economy remain low,” the bank
said today. “Nevertheless, there are now more companies than in
January that expect to increase their prices during the coming
year. These prices are expected to be small, however,
particularly in the manufacturing industry, and are mainly
linked to hopes for improved economic activity.”  Sweden’s central bank conducted interviews with companies
in the construction, retail, manufacturing and service
industries on May 6-24. This time 36 companies were interviewed
with about 224,000 employees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
