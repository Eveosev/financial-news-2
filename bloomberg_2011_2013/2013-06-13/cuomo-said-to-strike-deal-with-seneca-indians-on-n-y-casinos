New York  Governor  Andrew Cuomo 
struck a deal ending a more than $600 million dispute with the
Seneca Nation of Indians that may help keep Niagara Falls
solvent, according to a person familiar with the agreement.  The Senecas stopped paying the state a 22 percent share
of slot-machine revenue in 2009 after nontribal lottery
terminals were allowed inside a 10,500-square-mile (27,200-square-kilometer) exclusion zone.  Cuomo, a 55-year-old Democrat, is flying to Niagara Falls
to announce the deal today, according to the person, who spoke
on the condition of anonymity because the accord hasnâ€™t been
officially announced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
