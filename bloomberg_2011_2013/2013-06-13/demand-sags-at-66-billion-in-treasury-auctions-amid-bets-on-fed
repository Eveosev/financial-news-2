Treasury auctions of $66 billion of
three-, 10- and 30-year debt this week drew lower-than-average
demand for a third consecutive month amid speculation the
 Federal Reserve  may slow its asset purchases.  Yesterday’s sale of $13 billion in 30-year bonds attracted
the fewest bids since March. The  bid-to-cover ratio , which
gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of debt
offered, was 2.47, versus an average of 2.58 at the past 10
sales. Primary dealers bought 51.3 percent of the sale, the most
since March, versus an average of 49.5 percent at the past 10.
The bonds yielded 3.355 percent, the highest since March 2012.  “It’s very likely that we’ll see higher  interest rates 
from here,” said  William Larkin , a fixed-income portfolio
manager who helps oversee $500 million at Cabot Money Management
Inc., Salem,  Massachusetts . “The Fed is trying to normalize us
to the change. They are slowly going to say things are better,
but not where they want it to be. They’re going to slowly step
up over time.”  The current  30-year bond  yield fell five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 3.32 percent yesterday in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. It slid as much as
eight basis points. The yield touched 3.43 percent on June 11,
the highest since April 4, 2012, climbing from a 2013 low of
2.81 percent on May 1.  Ten-year note yields  dropped eight basis points to 2.15
percent. They touched 2.29 percent on June 11, also the highest
since April 2012. The benchmark yield has increased from this
year’s low of 1.61 percent on May 1.  Auction Bidders  At the 30-year bond auction,  indirect bidders , an investor
class that includes foreign central banks, purchased 40.2
percent of the securities, compared with an average of 36.7
percent at the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 8.5 percent,
versus an average of 13.8 percent at the past 10 auctions.  The government’s sale on June 12 of $21 billion in 10-year
notes had a  bid-to-cover  ratio of 2.53, the least since the 2.49
ratio at the August offering.  At the auction of $32 billion in Treasury three-year notes
on June 11, the  bid-to-cover  ratio was 2.95, the least since
December 2010.  The Treasury’s sales of $72 billion of three-, 10- and 30-year securities in May and of $66 billion of the same maturities
in April also drew lower-than-average coverage ratios.  Yield Surge  Yields have climbed since May as investors speculate
whether the economy is strengthening enough for Fed Chairman  Ben
S. Bernanke  to consider tapering bond purchases that have been
used to keep borrowing rates low. The central bank’s policy-setting  Federal Open Market Committee  meets June 18-19.  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities each month to put downward pressure on
borrowing costs and spur economic growth. It will slow the
purchases to $65 billion a month at its October meeting,
economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast last week.  Demand for Treasuries at auction has slackened this year
amid signs of improvement with the  U.S. economy  and speculation
on the direction of monetary policy. Investors have bid $2.96
for each dollar of debt sold at the U.S. government’s $971
billion in Treasury notes and bonds sold at auction, compared
with a record bid-to-cover ratio of $3.15 set in 2012, according
to Treasury data compiled by Bloomberg.  Thirty-year bonds have lost 7 percent this year, compared
with a 1.6 percent drop in the broader U.S. Treasuries market,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Long bonds
returned 2.5 percent in 2012, versus a 2.2 percent gain by
Treasuries overall.  Ten-year notes have dropped 2.8 percent in 2013, and three-year notes have slipped 0.3 percent, Merrill Lynch indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
