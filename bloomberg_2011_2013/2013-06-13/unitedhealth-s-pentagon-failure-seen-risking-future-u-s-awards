Air Force veteran Michelle Linn
worries that her two teenage boys will lose access to an autism
treatment center because  UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH)  has been slow
to pay the provider.  The nation’s biggest insurer took over a $20.5 billion
contract to coordinate military  health services  on April 1.
Since then, providers and beneficiaries have cited long delays
in medical care and payments. It has been “one fiasco after
another,” said Linn, who lives in  Colorado  Springs, Colorado.  UnitedHealth’s poor performance prompted a rebuke from the
Defense Department, which accused the company of failing to
comply with its contract and risking the health of active-duty
military, retirees and their families. The failures blemish the
insurer’s reputation and may hurt the company’s ability to win
more government contracts, said  Sheryl Skolnick , a  Stamford ,
Connecticut-based analyst at CRT Capital Group LLC.  “The egg on their face is pretty thick and it’s bright
yellow,” said Skolnick, who has a “buy” rating on
UnitedHealth. “The expectation was they would execute this
flawlessly. It was a real stunner to see the headline that the
Pentagon wasn’t happy.”  It would be difficult for defense officials to award
another contract to Minnetonka, Minnesota-based UnitedHealth
unless the company quickly fixes the snags, Skolnick said in a
phone interview.  Crisis Call  UnitedHealth cracked the U.S. military market with the
contract, awarded in March 2012. The Pentagon spent almost $61
billion on health care during the year that ended Sept. 30,
2012, said Wayne Plucker, a global industry manager at  Frost &
Sullivan , a consulting and market research firm based in
 Mountain View ,  California .  The Colorado Springs area, home to Fort Carson, Peterson
Air Force Base and the U.S. Air Force Academy, is part of the
21-state western coverage area under the contract for the
military’s Tricare health program. Other states covered in the
contract include California, Hawaii, Minnesota and  Arizona .  Jonathan Woodson, assistant secretary of defense for health
affairs, will hold a telephone conference call today with Fort
Carson health facility officials to discuss “unresolved issues
and challenges caused by the transition” to UnitedHealth,
Cynthia O. Smith, a Defense Department spokeswoman, said in a
phone interview.  Training Delays  Bruce Jasurda, a UnitedHealth spokesman, said the company
has conducted “extensive” training of its staff to ensure
consistent processing. Patients have complained of delays as the
contractor has struggled with a backlog in specialty-care
referrals and authorizations for medical services.  “The queue of pending referrals and authorizations have
been largely eliminated,” Jasurda said in an e-mail.  UnitedHealth said this week it has changed the leadership
of its military and veterans unit, which oversees the contract.
Lori McDougal, the former chief executive officer of that unit,
has accepted another position with the company, according to
Matt Stearns, a spokesman for the insurer.  Even so, physical therapists working with UnitedHealth
through the military contract have seen referrals decline as
much as 80 percent since the insurer assumed the contract, said
Lorne MacDonald, who owns Falcon Physical Therapy in  Colorado
Springs .  His four clinics serving injured troops, military retirees
and their dependents got 19 referrals last week, down from about
93 referrals the week before UnitedHealth took over the work, he
said.  “I met with UnitedHealth and they told me they have a
clean desk, and the backlog’s been resolved. I said: ‘Where did
all the patients go, then?’” MacDonald said.  Autism Center  The Alpine Autism Center has never received a payment from
UnitedHealth for its military work, said Tana Rice, the center’s
operations manager. There have also been delays in admitting new
military children to the program, she said. The center may have
to cut staff or restrict the number of military families that it
serves because of the issues with UnitedHealth, she said.  “There have been major problems, but we are working with
them on a resolution,” said Rice, speaking of UnitedHealth.  The insurer still owes the center $97,000, and “we have
had to rebill everything because they didn’t have their stuff
set up properly,” she said in a phone interview.  UnitedHealth has contacted the Alpine Autism Center,
addressing “their specific payment concerns,” said Jasurda,
the insurer’s spokesman.  Husband Deployed  Linn, who is on the autism center’s volunteer board of
directors, said she is concerned that the provider will cut
treatment options for military families while her husband, an
Air Force colonel, is deployed overseas. He is set to go to
 Afghanistan  in September.  “If my kids can’t go to Alpine, I’ll have to take a leave
of absence from work,” said Linn, a 49-year-old facility
engineer at Peterson Air Force Base. “This is an established
service that has been provided to military families for four or
five years. Why all of a sudden when UnitedHealth comes in is it
being treated differently?”  UnitedHealth’s delays affected members of the Tricare Prime
plan, which has about 1.6 million beneficiaries in the region
served by the company.  The Pentagon stepped in to grant a temporary waiver so
beneficiaries could get specialty care without UnitedHealth’s
authorization and not incur penalties. That waiver has been
extended through June 18.  Refund Option  The Defense Department hasn’t yet decided whether it will
recoup costs from UnitedHealth, said Austin Camacho, a spokesman
for Tricare.  The military probably won’t terminate the contract, said
 Larry Allen , president of Allen Federal Business Partners, a
consulting company based in McLean, Virginia.  “It’s much more likely and typical for them to ask a
contractor for remedial action, to pay them back money and
establish a workout plan,” Allen said in a phone interview.  The military chose UnitedHealth over TriWest Healthcare
Alliance Corp., a Phoenix-based company that coordinated care
for military families for 17 years, for its better “technical
approach,” according to a federal government review published
last year.  TriWest has cut 1,500 employees since losing the contract,
said Scott Celley, a spokesman for the company. David McIntyre Jr., TriWest’s founder, has said the contract was the company’s
“only business.”  In March 2012, TriWest protested the Pentagon’s decision to
give the contract to UnitedHealth with the Government
Accountability Office, Congress’s investigative arm which also
arbitrates contract disputes. It said the Defense Department
hadn’t properly considered UnitedHealth’s past performance
problems.  “We have nothing further to say,” Celley said in a June
10 phone interview.  Facebook Campaign  Some of UnitedHealth’s issues may be expected, given the
military’s switch to a new vendor, said  Ana Gupte , an analyst
with Dowling & Partners in Farmington,  Connecticut .  Still, investors should “keep an eye on whether these
types of things start happening in other areas of the
business,” she said.  “It’s obviously not a good thing,” she said.  More than 130 people have criticized UnitedHealth on
Tricare’s Facebook page. “My cancer isn’t waiting for
authorization!” one beneficiary wrote on April 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
