Commodity hedge funds are finding it
harder to make a profit partly because fees and other charges
“soured customers,” the Food & Agriculture Organization said.  Customers who besides paying annual fees are now finding
themselves “saddled with 100 percent of the losses,” the
United Nations agency said today in a report called “Commodity
hedge funds in retreat?” The FAO cited commodity index fund
investment data showing a 20 percent drop since April 2011,
mirroring a withdrawal from hedge funds.  “As with most mature businesses, commodity hedge funds are
finding profitability harder to come by,” the FAO said. “The
sobering truth about the nature of commodity futures may have
re-emerged: they are not investments at all but risk-shifting
instruments, always generating a loss for every gain.”  Commodity hedge funds have existed since 1979, and were
slow to take off until 2000, according to the report. The
2007-08  food crisis  was a money-maker for hedge funds, the FAO
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
