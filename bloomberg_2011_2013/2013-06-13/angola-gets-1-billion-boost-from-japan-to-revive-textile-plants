Angola  is spending $1 billion to
revamp three fabric plants that will employ 2,700 people, said
the local unit of  Marubeni Corp. (8002) ,  Japan ’s biggest trader of
grains and food products, which is rehabilitating the factories.  Reconstruction of the $270 million Textang II facility,
which will be able to produce 9 million meters (30 million feet)
of fabric annually, may be completed in two months, Koichi
Nagashima, managing director of Marubeni’s Angolan unit, said in
a June 6 interview in the capital, Luanda. Two other plants will
start output in 2015, he said.  The Japanese Bank for International Cooperation has
provided Angola with a $1 billion  credit line  to pay for the
upgrades, according to the website of the Asian country’s
embassy in the African nation.  “These projects will help diversify the economy and create
jobs for Angolans,” Nagashima said. “They are very
important.”  The economy of Angola, which gained independence from
Portugal in 1975, is recovering from a 27-year civil war that
ended in 2002. The country is striving to diversify its economy,
which the  International Monetary Fund  says depends on oil for 40
percent of its output.  Africa Textil in central Benguela province will be able to
produce about 2 million bed sets and 12 million towels each year
from February 2015, Nagashima said. The Satec factory in Kwanza
Norte province will have capacity to make 4 million shirts and 6
million meters of fabric annually from the third quarter of
2015, he said.  Spinning and weaving equipment from Japan,  South Korea ,
China and some European countries are already being imported,
Nagashima said.  After construction is completed, Textang II will employ
about 700 people while Africa Textil and Satec plan to provide
1,000 jobs each, Nagashima said.  Teijin Ltd. (3401) , a Japanese carbon-fiber maker, is providing
biological-treatment equipment to cut sludge from waste water in
the dyeing process by 50 percent more than the old system that
the plants used, according to a statement on the  embassy’s
website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
