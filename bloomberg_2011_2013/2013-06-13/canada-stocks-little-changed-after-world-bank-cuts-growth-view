Canadian  stocks  rose the most in
seven weeks as technology and consumer shares gained after
better-than-expected U.S. data offset a World Bank forecast for
slower growth in China.  Empire Co. (EMP/A)  soared 11 percent after a unit agreed to buy
Safeway Inc.’s Canadian assets in a $5.7 billion deal.
BlackBerry added 5.8 percent after  Societe Generale  SA advised
clients to buy the stock.  Lundin Mining (LUN)  Corp. jumped 8.8 percent
after agreeing to buy a nickel mine from Rio Tinto Group.
Kirkland Lake Gold Inc. lost 1.9 percent as the precious metal’s
price dropped.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 167.24
points, or 1.4 percent, to 12,277.13 at 4 p.m, the biggest
advance since April 24. The gauge snapped a two-day losing
streak that had erased 2.2 percent. Trading volume was 11
percent lower than the 30-day average.  “When you look at the  World Bank  reducing GDP estimates,
that was more related to the  emerging markets  and Europe,” said
Anish Chopra, a  fund manager  with TD Asset Management Ltd. in
Toronto. He helps manage C$204 billion ($201 billion). “The
data in  North America , whether in Canada or the U.S. with retail
sales above forecast and jobless claims decreasing, that’s all
positive. And when you put the two together that’s positive for
North America, which is why you’re getting the reaction you’re
seeing.”  Economic Data  Data today showed retail sales in the U.S. rose 0.6 percent
last month, surpassing the median forecast of 0.4 percent in a
Bloomberg survey. A separate report indicated fewer Americans
than forecast filed applications for  unemployment benefits  last
week. U.S equities rallied, with the  S&P 500  gaining 1.5
percent.  Data from  Statistics Canada  showed industrial companies’
use of production capacity rose in the first quarter, as oil and
gas companies boosted output.  Global equities slumped after the World Bank said in a
report released yesterday that the world economy will expand 2.2
percent this year, less than a January forecast for 2.4 percent
growth.  The growth forecast for China, Canada’s second-largest
trading partner, was cut to 7.7 percent from 8.4 percent, the
bank said. China is the world’s biggest consumer of industrial
metals and energy.  All 10 industries in the S&P/TSX rose, with technology
stocks adding 3 percent and producers of consumer staples
gaining 2.3 percent.  BlackBerry Rating  BlackBerry, formerly Research In Motion Ltd., climbed 5.8
percent to C$14.68.  Andy Perkins , an analyst with Societe
Generale, raised his rating for the stock to buy from sell.  Sales of BlackBerry’s latest smartphones are doing well,
with the touchscreen Z10 estimated to sell 4 million units and
the Q10, which boasts a physical keyboard, to sell just under 1
million units.  Empire soared 11 percent to a record C$74.77. Its Sobeys
Inc. will have 213 grocery stores in Western Canada and 199 in-store pharmacies in a bid to compete with Loblaw Cos., the
largest grocery retailer in Canada. Loblaw added 3.9 percent to
C$48.29.  Lundin Mining jumped 8.8 percent to C$4.33 after agreeing
to buy Rio Tinto’s Eagle nickel and copper project in northern
Michigan for about $325 million. Construction at the mine is
just over 50 percent complete and output is scheduled to start
in the fourth quarter of 2014, Lundin said in a statement.  Alacer Mines  Alacer Gold Corp. soared 12 percent to C$2.60 after Chief
Executive Officer David Quinlivan said in an interview with
Bloomberg the company plans to sell its two mines in Australia
within eight months due to high labor costs.  Dorel Industries Inc. (DII/B)  slumped 8.7 percent to C$35.40, the
biggest drop in 13 months. The Montreal-based maker of bicycles
and car seats said bad weather and widespread discounting hurt
its second-quarter expectations for earnings in its cycling
unit. Full-year earnings from that business will not exceed 2012
levels, and Dorel is cutting 50 jobs as a result.  Barrick Gold (ABX)  Corp., the world’s largest gold producer,
slipped 0.8 percent to C$20.02 and Kirkland Lake Gold retreated
1.9 percent to C$5.05. Gold futures for August delivery declined
1 percent to settle at $1,377.80 an ounce in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
