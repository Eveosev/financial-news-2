The Philippine peso snapped a four-day slide after investors judged its decline to a one-year low
was excessive. Government bonds fell.  The currency dropped below the 43 per dollar level this
week for the first time in a year and touched 43.295 today, the
weakest since June 8, 2012. The dollar’s 14-day relative
strength index against the peso was above 70 for the fourth day,
a threshold that signals the greenback may weaken, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. Foreign funds have sold $217 million more
Philippine stocks than they bought this month on concerns U.S.
policy makers will cut stimulus, reducing the supply of dollars.  “This is a pause on the peso’s depreciation trend,” said
 Jonathan Ravelas , chief market strategist at Manila-based  BDO
Unibank Inc. (BDO)  “A weaker peso should be in the best interest of
the  Philippines ” as it increases the value of remittances by
Filipinos working overseas, he said.  The peso climbed 0.3 percent to 43.10 per dollar, according
to Tullett Prebon Plc data. The currency has lost 4.7 percent
this year after appreciating 6.8 percent in 2012.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, increased 12 basis
points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 8.83 percent, the highest
level since November 2011.  The central bank today kept its benchmark overnight
borrowing rate unchanged at 3.5 percent and refrained from
changing the 2 percent rate on its special-deposit accounts.  The yield on the 8 percent  government bonds  due July 2031
climbed 15 basis points to 4.75 percent, the highest level since
February, according to prices from Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
