Indian (SENSEX)  stocks declined, with the
benchmark index holding at a two-month low, as global equities
extended a slump.  The S&P BSE Sensex dropped 0.9 percent to 18873.64 at 9:40
a.m. in Mumbai, poised for the lowest level since April 17.  Sun
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (SUNP) , India’s biggest drugmaker, sank
6 percent after it was asked to pay $550 million to Pfizer Inc.
and a partner to settle litigation over unauthorized sales of
the heartburn drug Protonix.  Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) 
declined to a two-month low.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index plunged, erasing this year’s
gains and poised to enter a correction, as investors extended a
selloff amid concerns central banks may reduce stimulus, and
after the  World Bank  cut its global growth forecast. The Sensex
has lost 4.2 percent this month on concern the rupee’s decline
will make imports more expensive and narrow the RBI’s scope to
extend interest-rate cuts at its policy review on June 17.  Overseas investors sold $140 million of local stocks on
June 11, paring this year’s inflows to $15.2 billion. That’s
still a record for the period, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  India’s credit-rating outlook was revised to stable from
negative by Fitch Ratings, following a nine-month policy push by
the government to pare the nation’s budget deficit and revive
economic growth.  The Sensex is valued at 12.9 times  projected 12-month
profits , the cheapest since April 24. That compares with the
MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index’s 9.7 times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
