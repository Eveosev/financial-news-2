China ’s  central bank  refrained from
draining funds from the financial system for the first time in
three months after a cash squeeze pushed up the overnight money-market rate to an all-time high.  The People’s Bank of China hasn’t offered repurchase
contracts or bills today, according to two traders required to
bid at the auctions. Two calls by  Bloomberg News  to the PBOC’s
media office went unanswered. The central bank has held repo
operations every week since February to drain cash and resumed
sales of bills in May for the first time since December 2011.  The overnight  repo rate , which measures interbank funding
availability, touched 9.78 percent on June 8, the highest since
May 2006, when the National Interbank Funding Center started
compiling the weighted average. China’s financial markets were
shut in the first three days of the week for the Dragon Boat
Festival holiday. The rate was at 6.32 percent as of 10:39 a.m.
in  Shanghai  today, little changed from June 9. The seven-day
 repo rate  dropped 34 basis points to 5.63 percent.  “If the PBOC sold repos or bills today, the market would
have collapsed,” said Liu Junyu, a bond analyst at China
Merchants Bank Co., the nation’s sixth-biggest lender. “The
cash shortage hasn’t eased and banks are still busy borrowing
money.”  Open-market operations are usually conducted every Tuesday
and Thursday and were last suspended on March 5. The halt is
probably temporary, said Liu.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
