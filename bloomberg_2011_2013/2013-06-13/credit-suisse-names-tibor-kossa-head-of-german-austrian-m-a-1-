Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , the second-biggest Swiss bank, named Tibor Kossa the head of mergers and
acquisitions for Germany and Austria as it realigns leadership
in Europe’s biggest economy.  Kossa, 35, will start the new job immediately, the Zurich-based bank said in an e-mailed statement today. He has been with
Credit Suisse in Frankfurt since 2002 and has advised clients in
energy and utilities, financial services, industrials and
infrastructure.  Credit Suisse last month named Nicolo Salsano as head of
the investment-banking department for Germany and Austria. He is
succeeding Ken Oliver Fritz, who is leaving to become  Lazard (LAZ) ’s
co-head for Germany with Eric Fellhauer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
