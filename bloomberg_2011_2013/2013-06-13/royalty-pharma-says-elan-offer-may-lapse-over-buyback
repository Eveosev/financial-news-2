Royalty Pharma said  Elan Corp. (ELN) 
shareholders may approve a share repurchasing program at their
meeting on June 17, which would force Royalty to withdraw its
$6.7 billion offer to take over the Irish company.  “Royalty Pharma believes that this proposal can still be
voted down if a few shareholders change their vote,” Royalty
Pharma said today in a statement. “Royalty Pharma remains in
active dialogue with Elan shareholders.”  Holders of more than 70 percent of Elan’s American
depositary shares had voted on Elan’s four proposals as of 5:30
p.m.  New York  time yesterday, Royalty Pharma said. Elan’s board
rejected Royalty’s latest offer June 10.  Elan shares fell as much as 9 percent in Dublin trading,
and were down 5.2 percent as of 1:08 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
