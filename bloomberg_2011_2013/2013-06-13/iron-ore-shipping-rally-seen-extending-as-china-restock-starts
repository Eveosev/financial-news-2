Rates to ship iron ore will extend
gains as  China  starts replenishing stockpiles of the commodity
used to make steel after prices fell, according to Arctic
Securities ASA.  “We would expect volumes to remain firm and thus see
freight rates for Capes continue to strengthen,” Erik Nikolai Stavseth, an Oslo-based analyst at the investment bank, said in
an e-mailed report today, referring to Capesize vessels. “While
the underlying market balance in dry bulk remains skewed towards
oversupply –- effectively limiting how high rates can go –- our
view is in a positive direction.”  Inventories at Chinese ports rose 6.5 percent since the end
of April to 71.6 million metric tons, according to Beijing
Antaike Information Development Co. Imported ore at Tianjin fell
30 percent to $110.90 a dry ton from a 16-month high on Feb. 20,
according to The Steel Index Ltd. Daily earnings for Capesizes
surged 22 percent this month to $6,300, according to the Baltic
Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
