Bonds and shares of  Eike Batista ’s
companies dropped after an O Estado de S. Paulo columnist
speculated the Brazilian billionaire may consider restructuring
debt.  EBX Group Co., the holding company for most of Batista’s
assets, may be considering restructuring its debt, Sonia Racy
wrote on her  blog  today, citing market speculation she didn’t
identify. The report is sending down the price of Batista’s
companies today, Claudio Coppola di Todaro, a  fund manager  at RC
Gestao de Recursos Ltda., said.  LLX Logistica SA (LLXL3) , Batista’s developer unit,  lost  5.5
percent to 1.18 reais at 12:12 p.m. in Sao Paulo today, the
worst-performing stock on the Brazilian benchmark Ibovespa
 index . OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA, the tycoon’s oil
unit,  declined  3.9 percent to 1 real, a record intraday low.
OGX’s bonds due in 2018 slumped 7.8 cents to 41.5 cents on the
dollar, also the lowest on record.  “The share price is telling me that there is something
wrong going on,” Coppola di Todaro said by telephone from  Sao
Paulo  today. Batista “entered into a spiral where bad news
follows more bad news. Something has to happen soon.”  EBX’s press office in Rio de Janeiro didn’t immediately
reply to an e-mail seeking comments on the Estado report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
