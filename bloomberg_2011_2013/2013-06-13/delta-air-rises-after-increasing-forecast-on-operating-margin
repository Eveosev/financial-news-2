Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  led gains by
U.S. carriers after it increased the lower end of its operating-margin forecast for this quarter on strong  travel demand  and
lower jet-fuel costs.  Delta  shares  advanced 3.5 percent to $18.71 at the close
in New York, while the Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index rallied
2 percent. Both gains were the biggest since June 7. Atlanta-based Delta’s stock has climbed 58 percent this year, as the
Bloomberg index has risen 42 percent.  Operating margin, a measure of income to expenses, will be
10 percent to 11 percent for the quarter ending June 30, up from
a previous outlook of 9 percent to 11 percent, Delta President
Ed Bastian said today at a conference hosted by Deutsche Bank in
 Chicago . His remarks eased concern that demand was softening
after Delta,  United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL)  and other carriers
reported May unit revenue that was little changed or lower.  “We’re coming in at the upper end of that range,” he
said. “June is shaping up to be a strong quarter. The revenue
environment is stable,  fuel  is declining.”  Demand for travel is strong and bookings in the coming
months “look solid,” Bastian said. Delta is the world’s
second-largest carrier by passenger traffic, behind United.  To contact the reporters on this story:
