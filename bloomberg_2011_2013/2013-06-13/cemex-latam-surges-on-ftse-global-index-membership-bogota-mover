Cemex Latam Holdings SA (CLH) , a cement
maker in Central and  South America , jumped the most on record
after  FTSE Group  included the company in a gauge tracked by
investment funds.  The shares advanced 3.9 percent to 13,200 pesos at 1:38
p.m. in Bogota after earlier gaining 4.6 percent, the biggest
increase on closing basis since the company’s Monterrey, Mexico-based parent, Cemex SAB, sold the shares in an initial public
offering in November.  The FTSE Group said yesterday in a statement on its website
that Cemex Latam would join its Global Equity Index Series
effective on June 24.  “The addition came sooner than we thought because the
stock has been trading for less than a year,” Fernando Pereda,
an analyst at Banco de Credito del  Peru , said in an e-mailed
response to questions. “Volume will probably grow
significantly, and so will the price, as portfolios that track
the FTSE indexes add the stock.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
