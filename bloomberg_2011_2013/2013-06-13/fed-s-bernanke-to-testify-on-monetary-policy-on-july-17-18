Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  will deliver his semi-annual  monetary policy  report to
Congress on July 17 and 18.  Bernanke will appear on the first day before the House
Financial Services Committee at 10 a.m., David Popp,
communications director for the committee, said in an e-mail. He
will appear the next day before the Senate Banking Committee, a
Senate aide confirmed.  The testimony, known as Humphrey-Hawkins for the
legislation that established the semi-annual appearances, gives
Bernanke an opportunity to present an update to Congress on the
central bank’s $85 billion-a-month quantitative easing program.  Fed policy makers next meet in Washington on June 18-19.
The central bank will release a statement and economic forecasts
at 2 p.m. on the final day of the meeting, and Bernanke will
hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
