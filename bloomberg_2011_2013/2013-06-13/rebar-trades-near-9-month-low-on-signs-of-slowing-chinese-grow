Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  traded near the lowest level in nine months as
investors returning from a three-day holiday remained concerned
that economic growth shows signs of slowing in the world’s
biggest steel consumer.  Rebar for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell as much as 1 percent to 3,386 yuan ($552) a metric
ton, the cheapest since Sept. 7, and was at 3,426 yuan at 11:09
a.m. local time. Futures have dropped 14 percent this year.  Industrial production last month rose a less-than-forecast
9.2 percent from a year earlier and factory-gate prices fell for
a 15th month, Chinese government data showed over the weekend.
Export gains were at a 10-month low and imports dropped after a
crackdown on fake trade invoices while fixed-asset investment
growth slowed and new  yuan  loans declined.  “The numbers haven’t been good,” Wang Yongliang, an
analyst at Beijing CIFCO Futures Co., said today by phone from
Tianjin. “But rebar prices may fluctuate at this point because
prices have come down a lot and some investors may prefer to
take profit in their previous short positions for now.”  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port in  China 
was unchanged at $110.90 a dry ton yesterday, according to the
Steel Index Ltd. The steel making ingredient fell to $110.40 a
dry ton on May 31, the lowest since October.  The  average spot price  for rebar fell 0.5 percent to 3,422
yuan a ton on June 7, according to data from Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
