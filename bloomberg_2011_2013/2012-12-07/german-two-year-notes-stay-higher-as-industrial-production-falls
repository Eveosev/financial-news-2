German two-year notes stayed higher
after a report showed industrial production in  Europe â€™s largest
economy unexpectedly slumped in October.  The yield on the zero percent securities due in December
2014 decreased one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
minus 0.060 percent at 11:07 a.m. London time. Ten-year rates
were little changed at 1.30 percent.  Production fell 2.6 percent from September, when it
declined 1.3 percent, the Economy Ministry in Berlin said today.
Economists forecast that output would remain unchanged,
according to the median of 42 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey. From a year earlier, production fell 3.7 percent when
adjusted for working days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
