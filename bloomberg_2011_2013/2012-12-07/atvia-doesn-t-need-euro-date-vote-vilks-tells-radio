Latvia doesn’t need to hold a
referendum on adopting the euro in 2014 as it already decided to
switch to the currency when it voted to join the European Union
in 2003, Finance Minister Andris Vilks said.  “I think that was decided in 2003” when the country voted
to join the bloc, Vilks said in an interview with Latvijas Radio
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
