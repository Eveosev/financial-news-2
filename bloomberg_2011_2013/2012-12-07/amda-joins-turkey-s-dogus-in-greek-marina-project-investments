Lamda Development SA (LAMDA) , a Greek marina
investor, and Dogus Holding AS, with interests in media, banking
and energy in  Turkey , set up a joint venture to invest in marina
projects.  Lamda will contribute the shares it holds in Flisvos Marina
Holding SA to the 50-50 venture and Dogus will participate in a
share capital increase, Lamda said today in a statement to the
 Athens  Stock Exchange. The cooperation may extend to real estate
and other tourism projects, the company said.  The value of the transaction will be determined with a
formula that takes into account seven times Flisvos Marina’s
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
minus financial debt, Lamda said.  Dogus will buy four marinas that  Greece  is selling to raise
cash,  Milliyet  reported June 18, citing Group Chief Executive
Husnu Akhan. Istanbul-based Dogus applied to the Greek tourism
ministry for clearance to acquire the marinas in Athens, Corfu
Island, Lefkas Island and the Peloponnese for 20 million euros
($25 million), Akhan said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
