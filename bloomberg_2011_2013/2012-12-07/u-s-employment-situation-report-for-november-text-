Following is the text of the November
employment report from the Labor Department.  THE EMPLOYMENT SITUATION -- NOVEMBER 2012  Total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 146,000 in November,
and the unemployment rate edged down to 7.7 percent, the  U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics  reported today. Employment increased
in retail trade, professional and business services, and health
care.  ------------------------------------------------------------  Hurricane Sandy    Hurricane Sandy  made landfall on the Northeast coast on October
29th, causing severe damage in some states. Nevertheless, our
survey response rates in the affected states were within normal
ranges. Our analysis suggests that Hurricane Sandy did not
substantively impact the national employment and unemployment
estimates for November.  BLS will release the regional and state
estimates on December 21st.
--------------------------------------------------------------  Household Survey Data  The unemployment rate edged down to 7.7 percent in November. The
number of unemployed persons, at 12.0 million, changed little.  Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult
men (7.2 percent), adult women (7.0 percent), teenagers (23.5
percent), whites (6.8 percent), and Hispanics (10.0 percent)
showed little or no change in November. The unemployment rate
for blacks (13.2 percent) declined over the month. The jobless
rate for Asians was 6.4 percent (not seasonally adjusted),
little changed from a year earlier.  The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks
or more) was little changed at 4.8 million in November. These
individuals accounted for 40.1 percent of the unemployed.  The civilian  labor force  participation rate declined by 0.2
percentage point to 63.6 percent in November, offsetting an
increase of the same amount in October. Total employment was
about unchanged in November, following a combined increase of
1.3 million over the prior 2 months. The employment-population
ratio, at 58.7 percent, changed little in November.  The number of persons employed part time for economic reasons
(sometimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers), at 8.2
million in November, was little changed over the month. These
individuals were working part time because their hours had been
cut back or because they were unable to find a full-time job.  In November, 2.5 million persons were marginally attached to the
labor force, essentially unchanged from a year earlier. (These
data are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals were not in
the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had
looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not
counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in
the 4 weeks preceding the survey.  Among the marginally attached, there were 979,000 discouraged
workers in November, little changed from a year earlier. (These
data are not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers are
persons not currently looking for work because they believe no
jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.5 million persons
marginally attached to the labor force in November had not
searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey for
reasons such as school attendance or family responsibilities.  Establishment Survey Data  Total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 146,000 in
November. Since the beginning of this year, employment growth
has averaged 151,000 per month, about the same as the average
monthly job gain of 153,000 in 2011. In November, employment
rose in retail trade, professional and business services, and
health care.  Retail trade employment rose by 53,000 in November and has
increased by 140,000 over the past 3 months. Over the month, job
gains occurred in clothing and clothing accessory stores
(+33,000), in general merchandise stores (+10,000), and in
electronics and appliance stores (+9,000). Employment in
miscellaneous store retailers decreased by 13,000.  In November, employment in professional and business services
rose by 43,000. Employment continued to increase in computer
systems design and related services.  Health care employment continued to increase in November
(+20,000), with gains in hospitals (+8,000) and in nursing care
facilities (+5,000). Health care has added an average of 26,000
jobs per month this year.  Employment in wholesale trade edged up over the month (+13,000).
Since reaching an employment trough in May 2010, the industry
has added 228,000 jobs.  Information employment also edged up in November (+12,000), with
the increase concentrated in motion picture and sound recording
(+15,000). On net, information employment has changed little
over the past 12 months.  In November, leisure and hospitality employment continued to
trend up (+23,000). Over the past 12 months, the industry has
added 305,000 jobs.  Employment in construction declined by 20,000 in November, with
much of the loss occurring in construction of buildings (-
11,000). Since early 2010, employment in construction has shown
no clear trend.  Manufacturing employment changed little over the month. Within
the industry, job losses in food manufacturing (-12,000) and
chemicals (-9,000) more than offset gains in motor vehicles and
parts (+10,000) and wood products (+3,000). On net,
manufacturing employment has changed little since this past
spring.  Employment in other major industries, including mining and
logging, transportation and warehousing, financial activities,
and government, showed little change in November.  The average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm
payrolls remained at 34.4 hours in November. The manufacturing
workweek edged up by 0.1 hour to 40.6 hours, and factory
overtime was unchanged at 3.2 hours. The average workweek for
production and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm
payrolls edged up 0.1 hour to 33.7 hours.  In November, average hourly earnings for all employees on
private nonfarm payrolls rose by 4 cents to $23.63. Over the
past 12 months, average hourly earnings have risen by 1.7
percent. In November, average hourly earnings of private-sector
production and nonsupervisory employees edged up by 3 cents to
$19.84.  The change in total nonfarm payroll employment for September was
revised from +148,000 to +132,000, and the change for October
was revised from +171,000 to +138,000.  _____________
The Employment Situation for December is scheduled to be
released on Friday, January 4, 2013, at 8:30 a.m. (EST).  ------------------------------------------------------------  Revision of Seasonally Adjusted Household Survey Data   In accordance with usual practice, The Employment Situation
release for December 2012, scheduled for January 4, 2013, will
incorporate annual revisions in seasonally adjusted unemployment
and other labor force series from the household survey.
Seasonally adjusted data for the most recent 5 years are subject
to revision.  Household Survey Reference Period  In the household survey, the reference period for November
2012 was the calendar week that included the 5th of the month.
Typically, the reference period for the household survey is the
calendar week that includes the 12th of the month. In accordance
with our usual practice for November, the reference and survey
periods were a week earlier this year so that household survey
interviews would not be conducted during the Thanksgiving
holiday.  SOURCE: U.S. Department of Labor  To contact the reporter on this story:
