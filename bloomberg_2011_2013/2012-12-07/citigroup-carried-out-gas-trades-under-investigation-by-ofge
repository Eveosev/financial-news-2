Citigroup Inc. (C)  carried out some of
the natural gas trades that are being investigated by the Office
for Gas and Electricity Markets and the Financial Services
Authority.  “Citi’s activity in the natural gas market on Sept. 28 was
related to client activity, and all Citi trades were completed
at levels consistent with the context of the market at the time
they were executed,” Jeffrey French, a spokesman for the bank
in London, said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  Chris Lock, a spokesman for Ofgem, and Chris Hamilton, a
spokesman for the FSA, both declined to comment when contacted
by telephone today.  The U.K.’s $480 billion gas market has come under the
spotlight after a journalist at the ICIS price agency reported
deals he suspected were being done below “prevailing” levels.  ICIS journalist Seth Freedman, a former broker at Insinger
de Beaufort NV and Eden Financial Ltd., notified his managers of
what he suspected was an attempt to manipulate assessments on
Sept. 28. ICIS reported the case last month to Ofgem, which said
in a Nov. 13 statement it’s “looking into the issue.” The FSA
said Nov. 12 it had received the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
