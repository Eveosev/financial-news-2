U.S. stocks erased early gains as a
bigger-than-forecast drop in  consumer confidence  and slide in
Apple Inc. shares wiped out an advance triggered by faster-than-
estimated growth in jobs.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed at
1,413.02 at 10:34 a.m. in New York after earlier gaining as much
as 0.5 percent. Apple, the biggest company by market value, lost
1.9 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
