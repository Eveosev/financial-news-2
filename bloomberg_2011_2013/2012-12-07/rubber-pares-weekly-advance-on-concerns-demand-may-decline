Rubber pared a weekly advance on
concern that demand may weaken after the  European Central Bank 
cut its forecast for euro-area economic growth and as data may
show U.S payrolls rose by the smallest amount since June.  The contract for May delivery dropped as much as 0.8
percent to 261.6 yen a kilogram ($3,179 a metric ton) on the
Tokyo Commodity Exchange, and ended at 263.6 yen. That pared
this week’s gain to 1.7 percent.  The euro area won’t start to shake off its slump until the
second half of 2013, ECB President  Mario Draghi  said yesterday
after policy makers left the benchmark rate at a record low.
Figures from the U.S. Department of Labor may show payrolls rose
by 85,000 workers last month, according to the median forecast
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The market remained concerned that the economic downturn
in Europe could lower demand,” said Chaiwat Muenmee, an analyst
at Bangkok-based broker DS Futures Co.  Rubber for delivery in May rose 0.2 percent to close at
24,405  yuan  ($3,917) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.
Thai rubber free-on-board was unchanged at 92.60 baht ($3.02) a
kilogram today, the Rubber Research Institute of  Thailand  said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
