Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  was sued over
claims its mobile phone application “Fly Delta” violates the
California’s Internet privacy law because it doesn’t describe
what personal information is being collected and how it will be
used, state Attorney General  Kamala Harris  said.  Harris said in an e-mailed statement that the app has been
in operation since 2010 and collects users’ names, telephone
numbers, e-mail addresses and other information. Harris’s
lawsuit seeks to block the app unless it includes a privacy
policy, plus penalties of as much as $2,500 for each violation.  Harris said yesterday the complaint was filed in state
court in San Francisco. The lawsuit couldn’t be confirmed in
electronic court records.  California’s Online Privacy Protection Act requires
websites and online services that collect personal information
to conspicuously post a privacy policy.  A call to Atlanta-based Delta’s after-hours media pager
wasn’t immediately returned yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
