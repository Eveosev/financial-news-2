Venezuelan bonds fell, pushing
yields up from the lowest level since February 2008, after
President Hugo Chavez broke a 21-day silence and returned from
cancer treatment in Cuba.  The yield on  Venezuela ’s benchmark 9.25 percent securities
due in 2027 rose 26 basis points, or 0.26 percentage point, to
9.43 percent at 10:12 a.m. in Caracas, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The bond’s price fell 2.02 cents today to
98.58 cents on the dollar, the biggest one-day drop since Oct.
9. The yield tumbled yesterday on speculation that Chavez is too
sick to complete a third term.  State-run Venezolana de Television broadcast images of
Chavez waving and smiling as he came off a plane. The self-
proclaimed socialist, who has seized companies and imposed
currency and price controls during his 14 years in office,  said
he was “very excited” to be back in Venezuela.  “Venezuelan bond prices will stay high, even with the
arrival of the president,”  Alejandro Grisanti , a Latin America
analyst at Barclays Plc in New York, said today by phone.
“There has been a change in Chavez’s actions that lead one to
believe that he is very sick. Even though he showed up on TV
coming back to Caracas, he was still absent for three weeks.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
