Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , the
world’s largest luxury carmaker, said Christoph Stark will
retire as  China  head in February after overseeing BMW sales jump
about 15-fold over eight years in the country.  Karsten Engel, currently the senior vice president of BMW
Group Germany, will take over the China portfolio from March 1,
Munich-based BMW said in an e-mailed statement today.  Engel will face the challenge of building on Stark’s
progress in helping BMW close in on the lead held by  Volkswagen
AG (VOW) ’s Audi in the world’s biggest car market. BMW is on pace to
sell more than 300,000 vehicles in China this year. It sold more
than 232,000 vehicles in 2011, up from about 16,000 units when
Stark took over in 2004.  “The prospects for the premium segment in China still look
promising, although growth is expected to be a little slower,”
 Norbert Reithofer , chairman of BMW’s board of management, said
in a statement. “Our commitment to China remains strong and is
assured.”  Engel, 54, has worked for the BMW Group for more than 25
years in different functions and regions, according to the
statement. He oversees sales and marketing in his current role
in the group’s home market.  Roland Kruger, 47, currently the head of BMW Group’s
Japanese sales company, will head the Germany sales region from
March, according to a separate statement.  BMW follows the growing number of foreign automakers
announcing leadership changes in China in 2012. Daimler AG’s
Mercedes-Benz,  General Motors Co. (GM)  and Volkswagen changed their
China heads this year.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
