German stocks  dropped from a five-
year high as the Bundesbank lowered its forecast for economic
growth in 2013 and a report showed that  consumer confidence  in
the U.S. fell more than forecast.  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  retreated 1.9 percent as the country’s
largest phone company lowered its dividend for the first time in
three years.  Wincor Nixdorf AG (WIN)  rose 3.6 percent after
reiterating that earnings will increase in 2013.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  slid 0.2 percent to 7,517.8 at the close in
 Frankfurt , paring the equity benchmark’s gain this week to 1.5
percent. The gauge jumped 1.1 percent yesterday to its highest
level since January 2008 after a report showed German factory
orders surged in October. The broader HDAX Index also retreated
0.2 percent today.  “The real economy in Europe remains troubled and in fact
continues to weaken with even  Germany  increasingly suffering,”
said Ioan Smith, a strategist at Knight Capital  Europe  Ltd. in
London. “We have seen for a while there is a divergence between
deteriorating economies and their financial markets. But today
we may have seen some evidence that they will not be divergent
for too long.”  German stocks fell as the Bundesbank reduced its  forecast 
for the rate of growth in Europe’s biggest economy next year.
The Frankfurt-based central bank cut its projection for 2013 to
0.4 percent from the 1.6 percent it had predicted in June.  Industrial Production  In a separate release, the German Economy Ministry said
 industrial output  dropped 2.6 percent in October as construction
activity and the production of investment goods slumped. The
 median economist estimate  had called for no change from
September, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  In the U.S., a measure of  consumer sentiment  slid to 74.5
this month. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had predicted
the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index would slip to
82 from a reading of 82.7 in November.  German stocks earlier erased their decline as a report
showed that employers in the U.S. added 146,000 workers last
month, more than the 85,000 that economists had forecast. The
 unemployment rate  dropped to 7.7 percent, its lowest since
December 2008, as the size of the labor force shrank.  Deutsche Telekom lost 1.9 percent to 8.42 euros after
saying it will cut its dividend to 50 euro cents a share in 2013
and 2014. That’s a 29 percent reduction from the 70 cents
promised for this year. The average analyst estimate had called
for a payout of 60 cents a share for the next two years, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Dividend Cut  The company lowered its dividend to enable it to invest
more in fast data networks in the U.S. and Germany. Capital
expenditure will total almost 30 billion euros ($39 billion)
over the next three years and will climb 18 percent in 2013.  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  declined 1.3 percent to 16.23 euros after
rallying 5.4 percent over the previous two days.  Germany’s
largest steelmaker  may reduce its payout to shareholders next
week, according to Bloomberg Dividend Forecasts.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  slid 2.1 percent to 13.30 euros,
trimming its advance this week to 4.2 percent.  Merck KGaA (MRK) 
dropped 2.2 percent to 104.20 euros, the biggest decline on the
DAX Index. It rallied 3.4 percent yesterday.  Deutsche Wohnen AG (DWNI)  fell 0.8 percent to 14.81 euros after
HSBC Holdings Plc lowered its recommendation for Germany’s
largest residential landlord by market value to underweight from
neutral, meaning investors should sell the shares.  Wincor Nixdorf jumped 3.6 percent to 34.60 euros after
Europe’s biggest maker of automated teller machines reiterated
that earnings and revenue will climb next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
