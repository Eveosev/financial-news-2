Macy’s Inc. (M)  authorized a $1.5 billion
increase in share repurchases which could lead to the retailer
more than doubling the dollar amount of stock it has purchased
since 2011.  Macy’s, the second-largest U.S. department-store chain,
said its board’s decision would bring its total outstanding
authorization to $1.86 billon, according to a statement today.
Since resuming share repurchases in August 2011, Macy’s had
acquired $1.49 billion worth of shares as of Oct. 27.  Chief Executive Officer  Terry Lundgren  said the chain is
committed to using its excess cash to enhance  shareholder value .
Today’s increase reflects the company’s confidence in its
ability to deliver sales growth, he said.  The shares  jumped  1.3 percent to $39.41 at the close in New
York. Cincinnati-based Macy’s has climbed 22 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
