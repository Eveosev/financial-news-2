Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , opened at 0.17 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.28 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.1 percent to 0.28 percent and averaging 0.16 percent,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  The central bank will sell Treasuries maturing from
November 2013 to February 2015. The sales are part of the Fed’s
program to replace short-term debt in its portfolio with longer-
term Treasuries in an effort to keep borrowing costs low.  The central bank plans to sell from $7 billion to $8
billion of securities today, according to the New York Fed’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
