Copper futures rose, capping the
longest run of weekly advances in 10 months, as U.S. payrolls
gained more than projected, boosting economic optimism and
signaling more metal demand.  Employment climbed by 146,000 in November, topping the
85,000 median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists, a
government report showed today. The unemployment rate fell to
the lowest in almost four years. Copper also rose as analysts
forecast industrial output will accelerate in  China , the world’s
top consumer of base metals.  “Markets are moving in reaction to the jobs report, and
the idea is that we’re finally in the mind-set that things are
going to get better” for the economy, Frank Cholly, a senior
commodity broker at RJO Futures in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview. “There are also signs of growth out of China.”  Copper futures for March delivery rose 0.5 percent to
settle at $3.663 a pound at 1:21 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
This week, the price advanced 0.4 percent, the fourth straight
gain and the longest rally since Feb. 3. The U.S. is the second-
biggest consumer of the metal.  Chinese industrial-production growth probably accelerated
for the third straight month in November to 9.8 percent from a
year earlier, while retail sales probably rose more than 14
percent, the most since March, according to median estimates in
Bloomberg News surveys before data due on Dec. 9.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months climbed 0.4 percent to $8,035 a metric ton ($3.64 a
pound). Aluminum, zinc, nickel and lead rose, and tin declined.  To contact the reporters on this story:
