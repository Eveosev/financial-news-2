Cia. Energetica de Sao Paulo ,
 Brazil ’s second-largest electricity generator by capacity, said
it may be taken over after rejecting license renewals for its
biggest dams. The shares jumped to a seven-week high.  Cesp, as the company is known, “could be bought,” Chief
Executive Officer Mauro Arce said in an interview in  Sao Paulo 
today. No negotiations for the sale are taking place, he said.
The company’s priority is to “pay off debt, not to invest,” he
said.  The utility controlled by the state of Sao Paulo this week
decided to reject the renewal of three hydroelectric dam
concessions expiring in 2015 because of new rules lowering
electricity rates. The dams generate 70 percent of Cesp’s power.  Cesp reversed losses to  jump  as much as 3.1 percent in Sao
Paulo trading after Arce’s comments. The shares rose 0.7 percent
to 19.54 reais at 12:52 p.m. A close at that level would be the
highest since Oct. 19.  The government of Sao Paulo, which controls Cesp through a
94.1% percent voting stake, has postponed plans to sell shares
at least three times as it waited for the federal government to
announce the terms of the concession renewals.  To contact the reporters on this story:
