Billionaire  Carlos Slim ’s  America
Movil  SAB has brought its Telcel brand,  Mexico ’s biggest
wireless carrier, to the U.S. to offer plans with unlimited
calls south of the border.  Telcel America is selling prepaid mobile-phone plans for
$60 a month with unlimited voice, text and data nationwide, plus
calls to Mexican landlines and mobile phones, according to its
 website . The carrier offers smartphones from Samsung Electronics
Co. and Google Inc.’s Motorola unit, or customers can use their
own devices.  America Movil is seeking to capitalize on recognition for
its Telcel brand among a growing U.S. demographic with roots in
Mexico, where Telcel has 70 percent of wireless subscribers.
People of Mexican origin increased 54 percent to 31.8 million in
2010 from 2000,  according  to the U.S. Census Bureau.  Slim’s company had 21.6 million wireless subscribers in the
U.S. at the end of September, out of a  total  of 256 million
across the Western Hemisphere. In the U.S., the company doesn’t
own its own network, reselling minutes from AT&T Inc.,  Verizon
Wireless  and others. Its wireless brands in the U.S. include
TracFone, SafeLink, Net10 and Straight Talk.  The company acquired Simple Mobile Inc., a U.S. wireless
reseller, for $118 million in June.  Mexico is America Movil’s largest market,  with  69.2 million
wireless subscribers. The company doesn’t offer an unlimited
package in Mexico like Telcel America’s $60 a month plan, even
for contract subscribers.  An America Movil press official had no immediate comment on
the new plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
