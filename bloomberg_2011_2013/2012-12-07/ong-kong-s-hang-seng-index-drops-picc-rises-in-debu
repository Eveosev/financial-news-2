Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  fell as
utilities declined. Most shares gained in the broader measure
before the release of Chinese economic data this weekend, and as
 People’s Insurance Company (Group) of China Ltd.  surged on its
trading debut.  About seven stocks climbed for every four that dropped in
the Hang Seng Composite Index. The Hang Seng Index slid 0.3
percent to 22,191.17 at the close, reversing earlier gains in
late trading. The gauge rose 0.7 percent for the week, its 11th
weekly gain in 14 weeks. Trading volume swelled to about 30
percent above the 30-day average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland
companies climbed 0.5 percent to 10,919.24.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index advanced 0.2 percent to
22,276. The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  rose 1.5 percent to 15.85,
indicating traders expect a swing of 4.5 percent for the equity
benchmark in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
