Dorbyl Ltd. (DLV) , a South African
mechanical-engineering company, received a higher offer from the
country’s state-owned Industrial Development Corp. to buy all
its issued shares.  The IDC, as the Johannesburg-based investor is known,
raised its offer to 85 cents from 73 cents, the companies said
in a statement. The threshold for the number of shares sold to
the IDC in order to trigger the transaction was lowered from 75
percent to 51 percent, according to the companies.  The IDC received “irrevocable undertakings” from owners
of 51 percent of Dorbyl’s shares to accept the new offer, the
companies said.  Trading in Dorbyl shares was suspended on the Johannesburg
Stock Exchange on Nov. 1 for not filing its financial statements
within three months after the fiscal year ended. The company’s
auditors said Nov. 19 that the company didn’t have sufficient
cash-flow to continue operating beyond the end of January 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
