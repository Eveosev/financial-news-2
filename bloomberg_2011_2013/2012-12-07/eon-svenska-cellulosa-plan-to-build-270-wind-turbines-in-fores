EON SE will develop 270  wind turbines 
with  Svenska Cellulosa AB (SCAA) , the owner of more private forest than
any European company, generating enough power for 100,000 homes.  Decisions on investing in the turbines are due for 2014 and
operations from 2016, Stockholm-based SCA said on its  website.   Europe’s largest paper-tissue maker is also building clean
energy projects in its forests to meet its own power demand.  “We also have our sustainability goals to have at least 5
terawatt-hours a year on our forest ground by 2020,” which is
almost achieved, Petter Tiger, a spokesman, said today by phone.  The deal with Dusseldorf-based EON covers areas including
Haestkullen, Haernoesand, Kramfors and Ljusdal. SCA in September
said it would build seven wind parks in  Sweden  with investment
from  Statkraft AS . It also produces biofuels, its website shows.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
