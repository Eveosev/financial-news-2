Gold traders are the least bullish in
seven weeks as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the metal’s longest
winning streak in at least nine decades will peak next year amid
accelerating U.S. growth.  Fourteen of 31 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect prices
to rise next week and 10 were bearish. A further seven were
neutral, making the proportion of bulls the lowest since Oct.
19. Goldman lowered its 12-month estimate by 7 percent to $1,800
an ounce on Dec. 5 and said the metal would average $1,750 in
2014. Morgan Stanley said yesterday bullion will be among next
year’s best-performing commodities.  Investors from  John Paulson  to  George Soros  are holding a
$143.7 billion bet through record holdings in bullion-backed
exchange-traded products as central banks from the U.S. to  China 
pledge more steps to spur economic growth. While gold is headed
for a 12th consecutive annual gain, it has failed to reach a new
record this year for the first time since 2007. Global economic
expansion will accelerate to 3.6 percent in 2013, from 3.3
percent this year, the International Monetary Fund estimates.  “Gold remains in the middle of a superstorm, but it’s not
the perfect storm,” said Filip Petersson, an analyst at SEB AB
in  Stockholm . “It’s not the time to short gold but on the other
hand it is not very appealing either. If the global recovery
picks up pace without inflation the game is over for gold.”  Gold Price  Gold rose 8.8 percent to $1,701.70 in  London  this year,
reaching a one-month low today. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge
of 24 commodities lost 1.7 percent since the beginning of
January and the MSCI All-Country World  Index (MXWD)  of equities climbed
11 percent. Treasuries returned 2.8 percent, a Bank of America
Corp. index shows.  The  Federal Reserve  said Oct. 24 it will maintain $40
billion in monthly purchases of mortgage debt and probably hold
interest rates near zero until mid-2015. Gold rose 70 percent as
the Fed bought $2.3 trillion of debt in two rounds of monetary
easing from December 2008 through June 2011. Prices will average
$1,853 in 2013, 11 percent more than this year’s average, Morgan
Stanley estimates, citing a weaker dollar, low interest rates
and purchases by central banks.  Investors buying bullion as a hedge against inflation and a
weaker dollar generally earn returns only through price gains,
increasing its allure as  interest rates  decline. The U.S. Dollar
Index, a measure against six currencies, reached a six-week low
two days ago. U.S. Mint sales of American Eagle gold coins more
than doubled in November to 136,500 ounces, the most since July
2010, data on its website show.  ETP Holdings  Metal held through ETPs increased every year since 2003,
when the first product was listed, and reached a record 2,627.6
metric tons Dec. 5, equal to almost a year of mine production,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Soros Fund Management
LLC raised its stake in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest gold
ETP, by 49 percent in the third quarter and Paulson & Co.
maintained the largest holding now valued at $3.6 billion, U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission filings show.  Gold will peak next year even as the Fed expands stimulus,
according to Goldman, which expects a price of $1,825 in three
months. It may drop to $1,625 by the end of 2014 without
additional Fed easing or $1,500 if U.S. growth is better than
expected, the bank said. America’s expansion will slow this
quarter before accelerating in the next four, the median of as
many as 73 economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg show.  While BNP Paribas SA expects central-bank stimulus to help
gold set a new record next year, the bank cut its 2013 forecast
for average prices by 1.8 percent yesterday to $1,865 and
predicts $1,780 in 2014. That would be the first drop in average
annual prices in more than a decade.  Record Average  Prices averaged a record $1,668 so far this year. They’re
yet to beat the all-time high of $1,921.15 set in September
2011. The 5.3 percent drop since Oct. 5 pushed gold below its
100-day moving average this week for the first time since
August. That may be because some hedge funds are selling the
metal to cover redemptions, economist  Dennis Gartman  wrote in
his daily newsletter yesterday.  “Hedge funds that have underperformed and need to raise
liquidity for redemptions are likely to sell their winners,”
said Jeffrey Sica, who helps oversee more than $1 billion of
assets as president of SICA Wealth Management in Morristown,  New
Jersey . “We will get momentum again, but I don’t think it’s
going to come until after the first of the year.”  The Washington-based IMF cut its 2013 growth forecast twice
since July as  Europe  contends with a credit crisis and expansion
slowed in China, last year’s second-biggest gold buyer. Jewelry
demand slumped 9.8 percent in the first nine months, World Gold
Council data show.  Hedge Funds  Hedge funds ’  bets  on a rally this year are on average about
28 percent lower than in 2011, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data show. They raised wagers in the three weeks to
Nov. 27, with their net-long position of 168,238 contracts now
15 percent below the 13-month high set in October.  In other commodities, 15 of 25 traders and analysts
surveyed expect copper to gain next week and six were bearish.
The metal for delivery in three months, the London Metal
Exchange’s benchmark contract, climbed 5.8 percent to $8,040 a
ton this year.  Four of 10 people surveyed expect raw sugar to rise next
week and the same amount predict a decline. The commodity slid
18 percent to 19.19 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York  this year.  Super Cycle  Thirteen of 27 people surveyed anticipate higher corn
prices next week and six said the grain will decline, while 18
of 28 said soybeans will rise and eight expect lower prices. Ten
of 21 traders predicted higher wheat prices and five were
bearish. Corn rose 15 percent to $7.415 a bushel this year as
soybeans advanced 23 percent to $14.81 a bushel in  Chicago .
Wheat gained 31 percent at $8.5725 a bushel.  Morgan Stanley joined Goldman in predicting the so-called
commodity super cycle isn’t over as the S&P GSCI gauge headed
for its worst year since 2008. Goldman reiterated its
recommendation that investors should be “overweight” in raw
materials, and that prices will return 7 percent in 12 months.  The Fed will announce its latest policy decision Dec. 12 at
a time when U.S. lawmakers seek a deal to avoid the so-called
fiscal cliff of spending cuts and tax increases due at the start
of next year. The  European Central Bank  has pledged more action
and China approved a $158 billion subways-to-roads construction
plan. The  Bank of Japan  is ready to take “appropriate and
decisive action” if risks to its outlook become significant,
Deputy Governor  Kiyohiko Nishimura  said Dec. 5.  “The upcoming fiscal-cliff delays in resolutions will
certainly impact sentiment for commodity investments,” said
Bayram Dincer, an analyst at LGT Capital Management in
Pfaeffikon,  Switzerland . “Global stimulus and growth rates
would be commodity-price supportive due to higher demand.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
