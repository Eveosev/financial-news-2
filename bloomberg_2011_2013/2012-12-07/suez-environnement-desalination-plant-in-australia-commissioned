Suez Environnement (SEV) , Europe’s second-
biggest water company by market value, said the desalination
plant in  Australia  that was commissioned last month has reached
full drinking water production capacity.  The plant that’s pumping water in Melbourne’s Cardinia
reservoir has brought its second and third water production
lines on stream, raising the flow produced to as much as 450,000
cubic meters a day, the facility’s maximum.  By bringing the three lines on stream “the final stage now
involves passing a reliability test, which consists of running
at full capacity for 30 days,” said Remi Lantier, chief
executive officer of Degremont, Suez’s water treatment
subsidiary.  The Paris-based company, which supplies 30 percent of
Australia’s drinking water, has taken 322 million euros ($415
million) of provisions on the  Melbourne  project due to delays
and cost overruns caused by strikes and bad weather.  After the 30-day test, Degremont under terms of the
contract is due to hand over the facility to operating and
maintenance teams to manage the plant for 27 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
