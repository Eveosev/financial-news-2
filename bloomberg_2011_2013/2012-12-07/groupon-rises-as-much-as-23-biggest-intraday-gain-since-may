Groupon Inc. (GRPN)  surged to the highest
price in three weeks on speculation that  Google Inc. (GOOG)  might
consider buying the online coupon provider.  The shares advanced 23 percent to $4.69 in New York,
closing at the highest price since Oct. 19. The stock pared to
77 percent its loss since an initial public offering in November
of 2011.  The stock plunge since the IPO may spark renewed takeover
interest from Google now that Groupon’s market value has slipped
to $3.07 billion, said  Tom Forte , an analyst at Telsey Advisory
Group. Google had considered acquiring Groupon for $6 billion
the year before its public market debut, people familiar with
the matter said at the time.  “Where the stock is currently trading, it’s a takeout
candidate,” Forte said. “If Google was interested at $6
billion, I think it’s a possibility.”  Paul Taaffe , a spokesman for Groupon, declined to comment
on takeover speculation, as did Katelin Todhunter-Gerberg, a
spokeswoman for Google.  In the year since the IPO, growth has slowed and Groupon’s
as demand for daily deals has dwindled. Chief Executive Officer
Andrew Mason has struggled to shore up the core business and
push the company into new areas to generate added sources of
revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
