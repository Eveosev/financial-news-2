Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) , the last of
 Canada â€™s six main banks to report fourth-quarter results, said
profit climbed 31 percent on gains from capital markets-related
businesses.  Net income for the period ended Oct. 31 climbed to C$1.52
billion ($1.53 billion), or C$1.18 a share, from C$1.16 billion,
or 97 cents, a year earlier, the Toronto-based lender said today
in a statement.  Scotiabank joins competitors such as  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) 
and  Bank of Montreal (BMO)  in reporting higher fees for advising on
takeovers and arranging stock sales, offsetting slower growth in
consumer banking. Profit from the Scotiabank Global Banking and
Markets division rose 63 percent to C$396 million.  On an adjusted basis, Scotiabank earned C$1.21 a share.
That topped the C$1.19 a share average  estimate  of 16 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Scotiabank fell 0.5 percent to C$55.56 in trading yesterday
on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The shares have climbed 9.3
percent this year, the third-best performer on the 10-member
 S&P/TSX Banks Index. (STBANKX)   Domestic consumer banking profit climbed 15 percent to
C$481 million, while international banking increased 22 percent
to C$453 million. Scotiabank has operations in more than 50
countries, including Chile, Mexico and  Thailand . Wealth
management profit increased 15 percent to C$300 million.  Scotiabank said it expects to have earnings per share
growth of 5 percent to 10 percent in 2013 and a return on equity
of 15 percent to 18 percent, matching its forecast for 2012.  (Scotiabank will hold a conference call at 2 p.m. Toronto time
to discuss results. To listen, dial +1-416-644-3414 or
