Belarus has increased raw sugar
shipments to  Russia  by 25 percent this year because of record
output, the  Institute for Agricultural Market Studies  said.  Shipments of more than 31,000 metric tons in November
brought the total this year to 226,000 tons from 181,000 tons in
the same period last year, the institute known as Ikar said on
its website today. Belarus will produce about 600,000 tons of
sugar this season started Sept. 1, it said.  Shipment figures are for rail only, Ikar said. With more
shipments in December, Belarusâ€™s total sugar exports by rail may
be 260,000 tons this year, Moscow-based Ikar said.  An increase in wholesale sugar prices in Russia and
devalued currency in Belarus led to the increased shipments,
Ikar said. Belarus is expected to ship another 205,000 tons of
sugar this year to Central Asian states and Caucasian countries
such as Armenia, Azerbaijan and  Georgia , bringing total exports
to at least 500,000 tons, Ikar estimated. Belarus sugar demand
is about 380,000 tons, Ikar said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
