Egyptian Vice President Mahmoud Mekki
said President Mohamed Mursi is conditionally willing to delay
the Dec. 15 referendum on a new constitution, according to the
state-run Ahram Online website.  “The political forces who demand the delay of the
referendum must provide guarantees that there will not be
appeals” for further delays in the courts, according to a
presidential statement announced by Mekki, the website reported.  After that announcement, the leader of the opposition
National Salvation Front,  Mohamed ElBaradei , called on Mursi to
withdraw the constitutional declaration “tonight” and to
postpone the referendum until national consensus is achieved.  To contact the reporter on this story:
