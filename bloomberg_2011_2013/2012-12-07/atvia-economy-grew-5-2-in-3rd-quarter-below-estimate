Latvia’s  economy  grew at the fastest
pace in the European Union in the third quarter, according to
revised data showing the expansion was less than previously
estimated.  Gross domestic product, fueled by trade, manufacturing and
construction, rose a revised 5.2 percent from a year earlier,
less than the 5.3 percent preliminary estimate, the  statistics
office  in the capital, Riga, said by e-mail today. GDP grew 1.7
percent from the previous quarter.  Latvia is rebounding from the world’s deepest recession in
2008-2009, which erased almost a quarter of economic output
after a property bubble burst and credit inflows dried up,
prompting an  International Monetary Fund  bailout. GDP will
advance by more than 5 percent this year, the IMF’s mission
chief Shekhar Aiyar said on Nov. 26.  Manufacturing and trade grew 7 percent from a year earlier
between July and September while construction expanded 8
percent, according to today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
