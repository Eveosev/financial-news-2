Soybean futures for January delivery
fell 0.5 percent to $14.84 a bushel at 7:43 a.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade, erasing a gain of as much as 0.5 percent.  Prospects improved for crops in  Argentina , where wet
weather has delayed planting in recent weeks. A drier trend will
develop in the country after today, with just a few showers
possible in some areas until at least Dec. 12, Telvent DTN said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
