The San Diego Chargers will fire head
coach Norv Turner and General Manager A.J. Smith at the end
National Football League season,  the Union-Tribune reported ,
citing people familiar with the decision.  The Chargers are 4-8 as they prepare to meet the Steelers
at  Heinz Field  in Pittsburgh on Dec. 9.  Chargers President Dean Spanos decided at least a month ago
to dismiss Turner and Smith, the newspaper said. The report is
speculation, Spanos said in a statement released last night by
the team.  “There is only one person in this organization who will
make those decisions and that’s me, and I haven’t shared my
thoughts with anyone,” Spanos said in the statement. “I will
make my evaluations at the end of the season. Anything coming
out now -- from sources or otherwise -- is pure speculation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
