expectations a strengthening Chinese economy will boost demand.  Rebar for May delivery rose 1.7 percent to close at 3,656
 yuan  ($587) a metric ton on the  Shanghai  Futures Exchange.
Futures climbed 4.6 percent this week, the biggest such gain
since the week ended Oct. 15, 2010.  There is growing “enthusiasm” for urbanization projects
in  China ’s southwest after the country’s leaders signaled there
may be more pro-growth policies, Shenyin Wanguo Futures Co. said
in a report today.  “If you look at daily production right now, it’s higher
than last year,” Shenyin’s analyst Yu Yang said by phone from
Shanghai. “We find steel companies are rather firm on their
prices as they anticipate stronger demand,” she said.  Production nationwide has averaged about 1.9 million tons
per day since October, compared with 1.6 million tons last year,
Yu said, citing her analysis. Steelmakers enjoy some profits now
and expect continued improvement, she said.  The average spot  price  of rebar, used in housing
construction and infrastructure projects, fell 0.1 percent to
