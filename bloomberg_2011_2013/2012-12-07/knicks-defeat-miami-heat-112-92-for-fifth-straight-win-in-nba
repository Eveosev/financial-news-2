Raymond Felton scored a season-high
27 points to lead the New York Knicks to their fifth straight
win, 112-92 over the National Basketball Association champion
Miami Heat.  The victory at American Airlines Arena in Miami last night
lifts the Knicks to 14-4, 1 1/2 games ahead of the Heat (12-5)
atop the Eastern Conference.  The Knicks, who beat Miami 104-84 in their opening game of
the season, were without top scorer  Carmelo Anthony , who needed
five stitches to close a finger wound sustained Dec. 5 against
the Charlotte Bobcats.  “We played a great game minus our superstar,” Felton, who
made six of New York’s 18 3-pointers, told reporters.
“Everybody did something amazing.”  The teams reached halftime tied at 53-53 before New York
made eight 3-pointers in the third quarter, the most by any team
in a quarter this season, as it outscored Miami 37-27.  The Knicks added four more 3-pointers in the fourth quarter
as they outshot the hosts 22-12 to send the Heat to a second
straight defeat.  “It was a total team effort from everybody,” Knicks coach
 Mike Woodson  told reporters. “Our defense was solid and then we
kind of broke it open at the end.”  Steve Novak came off the bench to score 18 points and Tyson Chandler and J.R. Smith each contributed 13 for the Knicks.  LeBron James had a game-high 31 points, 10 rebounds and
nine assists for Miami, while  Dwyane Wade  contributed 13 points
and  Chris Bosh  added 12.  “We’re not going to brush this off,” Heat coach  Erik Spoelstra  told reporters. “We’re going to fix it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
