Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP) , the
world’s biggest solar-panel maker, reduced its forecast for
shipments this year and plans to restate earnings back to 2010
following a fraud investigation over an investment in  Italy .  Suntech said it has been a victim of fraud that will reduce
its 2010 net income by $60 million to $80 million, according to
a statement today. The Jiangsu, China-based company has
concluded that a security interest it received in connection
with financing solar projects in Italy “does not exist,” and
the company plans to amend financial statements for 2010, 2011
and the first quarter of 2012 early next year.  Preliminary third-quarter sales were $387 million, down 56
percent from a year earlier and lower than the $466 million
average of 13 analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Suntech
said panel shipments in the quarter fell 10 percent from the
prior quarter, without giving the amount. The statement didn’t
include net income or debt figures.  Suntech announced the fraud investigation in July and
hasn’t released its second-quarter results. Preliminary sales
for the second quarter, issued in August, were $471 million, and
the company said shipments rose 33 percent from the first
quarter.  Shipments this year will be 1.7 gigawatts to 1.8 gigawatts,
down from an earlier forecast of 1.8 gigawatts to 2 gigawatts,
Suntech said.  Suntech’s American depositary receipts, each worth one
regular share, climbed 3.3 percent to 89 cents at the close in
New York. They have declined 60 percent this year. The company
is facing delisting from the  New York  Stock Exchange because the
price is below the $1 minimum.  To contact the reporters on this story:
