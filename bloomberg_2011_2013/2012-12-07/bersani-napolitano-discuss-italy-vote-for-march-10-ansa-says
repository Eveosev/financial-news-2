Italian President Giorgio Napolitano
and Pier Luigi Bersani, leader of the country’s Democratic
Party, discussed the possibility of setting early elections for
March 10, news agency Ansa reported, without citing anyone.  The two men met in Rome today to discuss the current
political crisis after Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi ’s party
yesterday threatened to withdraw its support for Prime Minister
 Mario Monti ’s government.  A March vote would mean that Napolitano would have to
dissolve the legislature between Jan. 10 and Jan. 10, Ansa said.
Elections are due by May.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
