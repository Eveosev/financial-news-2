OAO MegaFon (MFON)  and its main shareholder
billionaire Alisher Usmanov bought 50 percent of  Euroset Holding
NV  in a deal that gives Russia’s biggest handset retailer an
enterprise value of $2.3 billion.  MegaFon, Russia’s second-largest mobile operator, and
Usmanov paid a combined $1.07 billion to buy equal stakes from
billionaire  Alexander Mamut  and may pay an $100 million more if
Euroset meets “certain targets” in the first half of 2013,
MegaFon said in a statement today. The operator is expected to
buy Usmanov’s 25 percent of Euroset in a year, it said.  Russian mobile operators are expanding into retail to
increase revenue from users and participate in profits from
rising smartphone sales. MegaFon’s competitor  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) ,
owned by billionaire  Mikhail Fridman  and  Telenor ASA (TEL) , said today
it raised its stake in Euroset by 0.1 percent to 50 percent.  OAO
Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) , Russia’s largest mobile operator, runs its
own retail outlets nationwide.  MegaFon said the investment in Euroset is “instrumental in
further enhancing the quality of its subscriber base and in
helping to reduce churn.” The Euroset value includes net debt,
the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
