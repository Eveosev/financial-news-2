(Corrects date of deal in second paragraph in story
published yesterday.)  Gunvor Group Ltd. said it bought a 10
percent stake in the Transalpine pipeline to secure long-term
crude supply to its refinery in Ingolstadt,  Germany .  The deal closed on Dec. 4, the company said today in an e-
mailed statement. The pipeline known as TAL runs from Trieste in
 Italy  to locations in Germany.  Austriaâ€™s  OMV AG (OMV)  has a 25 percent share in TAL and  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  owns 24 percent, according to the statement.
Ruhr Oel GmbH, a venture of  BP Plc (BP/)  and OAO Rosneft, has an 11
percent stake,  Eni SpA (ENI)  holds 10 percent, BP 9 percent,  Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM)  6 percent,  ConocoPhillips (COP)  3 percent and  Total SA (FP)  2
percent, the statement showed.  Gunvor completed the purchase of the 110,000 barrel-a-day
Ingolstadt refinery from Petroplus Holdings AG, the insolvent
Swiss refiner, in August. The pipeline stake Gunvor bought was
previously owned by Petroplus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
