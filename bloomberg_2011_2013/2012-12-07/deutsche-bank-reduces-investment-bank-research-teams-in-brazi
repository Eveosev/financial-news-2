Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , Germany’s largest
lender, reduced employees in its Brazilian investment bank and
research units as part of a global effort to save 4.5 billion
euros ($5.8 billion) by 2015.  Deutsche Bank is cutting its workforce in Latin America’s
largest country to “seek improvement of its operational
excellence,” the Frankfurt-based lender said today in an e-
mailed statement. The bank, which has about 400 employees in
 Brazil , including workers from outsourcing services, didn’t say
how many people were fired.  The firm will maintain investment bank, global markets,
equities and global-transaction banking divisions, it said in
the statement.  Jaime Singer will continue as the head of its investment
bank in Brazil, said a bank official, who asked not to be named
because of internal policy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
