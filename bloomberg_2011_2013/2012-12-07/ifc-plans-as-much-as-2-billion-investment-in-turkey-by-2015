International Finance Corp., the
 World Bank ’s private-sector investment arm, plans to invest
between $1.7 billion and $2 billion in Turkey between 2012 and
2015, its fourth largest commitment in the world, under its
country partnership strategy.  The Washington-based lender committed $173 million in its
fiscal year 2013, which started in July, for projects including
film manufacturer Superfilm, textile producer Sanko Tekstil,
construction materials maker Izoduo, and infrastructure lending
of $400 million for renewable energy and gas generation
projects, Dimitris Tsitsiragos, vice president for  Europe ,
 Middle East  and North Africa, said at a news conference in
Istanbul today. The lender also provided $20 million to
Mediterra Capital Management Ltd., a buyout firm based in
Istanbul, for its debut fund of about $195 million, he said.  IFC has an outstanding exposure of $2.5 billion to Turkey,
the second biggest in the world the lender has, Tsitsiragos said
in his Istanbul office, the largest outside the institution’s
head office in  Washington , from where he controls 52 countries
in the region.  “We are focusing on Turkey’s southeast region and
frontiers,” Tsitsiragos said, referring to the country’s
poorest region. IFC provided $50 million facility to a cardboard
maker in the southeastern town of Kahramanmaras, he said.  “We also want to support Turkish companies that are
seeking to do business in  India , Northern Iraq and  Latin
America ,” Tsitsiragos said.  IFC could exceed its 2012-2015 country partnership strategy
of the committed $2 billion should there be demand for it,
Tsitsiragos said.  “We want to bring in a dollar from other sources for every
dollar we put in,” Tsitsiragos said. “Ideally we would like to
have $2 for every dollar we provide.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
