Nigeria ’s naira advanced to its
highest in a month after state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum
Corp. was said to have sold dollars to lenders, boosting supply.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer advanced 0.2
percent to 156.975 a dollar, the highest since Nov. 6, as of
4:30 p.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital. The currency gained
0.1 percent this week, its third weekly gain in five, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The naira has risen 3.3 percent
this year, the second-best performance among African currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. or NNPC periodically
sells dollars to lenders to meet local spending needs. The  oil
companies  pumping the country’s oil are the second-biggest
source of foreign currency after the  Central Bank of Nigeria ,
which sells at twice-weekly auctions to support the local
currency.  The NNPC sold dollars to banks today, Augustus Nwachukwu,
analyst at Lagos-based Stanbic IBTC Holdings Co., said by phone.
The sale was speculated to be “between $400 million and $450
million.”  Fidelis Pepple, NNPC spokesman, had no immediate comment
when contacted on the phone by Bloomberg.  The central bank held its benchmark  interest rate  at a
record high 12 percent this year to ease inflation pressures and
stabilize the naira. Inflation, which accelerated for the first
time in four months to 11.7 percent in October, remains above
the bank’s target of less than 10 percent.  The yield on 16.39 percent naira debt due January 2022 fell
nine basis points to 12.01 percent, according to yesterday’s
prices on the website of the Lagos-based Financial Markets
Dealers Association website. Borrowing costs on the nation’s
$500 million of Eurobonds due January 2021 fell two basis points
to 4.184 percent.  Ghana ’s cedi appreciated less than 0.1 percent at 1.8911 a
dollar in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
