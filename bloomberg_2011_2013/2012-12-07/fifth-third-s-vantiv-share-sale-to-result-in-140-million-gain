Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) , Ohio’s largest
lender, said a sale of part of its  Vantiv Inc. (VNTV)  stake will result
in a $140 million pretax gain in the fourth quarter.  The pricing and sale of 12.5 million shares, or about 15
percent of the bank’s ownership stake, will result in a $91
million gain after tax, the Cincinnati-based company said today
in a statement. Fifth Third will also book a $135 million pretax
charge by prepaying $1 billion of term debt scheduled to mature
on Jan. 5, 2016, according to the statement. That will
contribute about $40 million to $45 million to net interest
income annually, or about four basis points to the net interest
margin, according to the statement.  Fifth Third said earlier this year it would use the after-
tax proceeds of its Vantiv stake sale to repurchase its own
shares, a plan that was not opposed by the Federal Reserve
during the lender’s capital stress tests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
