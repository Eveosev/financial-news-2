OAO Mechel (MTL) , Russia’s largest coking
coal producer, won a tender for 55 percent of OAO  Vanino
Commercial Sea Port (MTPV)  on the Pacific coast, outbidding investor
Oleg Deripaska’s En+ Group.  Mechel (MTLR)  offered 15.5 billion rubles ($500 million) for the
government’s stake, beating six competitors, VTB Capital, the
sale organizer, said today in a statement. The winning bid was
10 times higher than the minimum price, the bank said.  With $8.8 billion of net debt at the end of June, Mechel is
one of the most indebted Russian mining companies. This week
Mechel completed a $1 billion restructuring, agreeing on a 12-
month grace period during which it doesn’t have to pay down the
loan. The coal producer is seeking to sell assets for funds to
pay debt and finance projects in eastern Russia, which may
benefit from access to the port.  “We congratulate the winner and will wait for the
mandatory offer to buyout minority shareholders as required by
the law,” Elena Rollins, a spokeswoman for En+, said by phone.
Deripaska’s company bid 10.6 billion rubles, she said.  Mechel may need to spend $300 million to buy out
minorities, BCS Financial Group said. The company doesn’t plan
to comment before the government approves the tender results,
said Pavel Taran, a Mechel spokesman.  “The price is very high for Mechel,”  George Buzhenitsa ,
an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in Moscow said by phone. “On the
other hand, without Vanino, Mechel would need to build a new
port to ship coal form  Far East  as Elga coal deposit develops.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
