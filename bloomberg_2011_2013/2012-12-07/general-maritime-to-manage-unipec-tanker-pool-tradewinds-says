General Maritime Corp. will place as
many as 19 of its tankers in a pool to transport crude for China
International United Petroleum & Chemical Co., or Unipec,
shipping newspaper  Tradewinds  said, citing unnamed sources.  General Maritime, a New York-based tanker owner, will also
manage the pool for Unipec, the world’s second-largest tanker
charterer, with ships replacing those from the Tankers
International pool, the Oslo-based newspaper said today.  Unipec, the trading division of  China Petroleum & Chemical
Corp. (600028) , or Sinopec, the nation’s largest refiner, didn’t respond
to an e-mail to its London office, and phone calls outside
business hours to its Beijing operations weren’t answered.
Tankers International doesn’t comment on its activities, said a
woman from the London office who returned a call from Bloomberg
seeking comment. She didn’t provide her name and didn’t say why
she can’t be identified.  Jeffrey Pribor, General Maritime’s chief financial officer,
was out of the office and not available for comment, according
to an unidentified woman who answered his phone at the company’s
New York-based office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
