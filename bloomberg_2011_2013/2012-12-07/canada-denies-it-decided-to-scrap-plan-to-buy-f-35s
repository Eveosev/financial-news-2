A Canadian government spokesman is
denying reports that the country has decided to scrap its plans
to purchase  Lockheed Martin (LMT)  Corp.’s F-35 fighter jets.  “Cabinet has not taken a decision on the F-35,” Andrew
MacDougall, a spokesman for Prime Minister Stephen Harper,
posted on the Twitter social network site.  MacDougall was referring to a report in the National Post
newspaper that said the government would cancel the purchase of
65 of the planes because an audit by accounting firm KPMG LLP
will show the cost of the plane to be more than twice as much as
had been projected.  The government has received the KPMG report and is
reviewing it, according to a statement sent by the office of
Public Works Minister Rona Ambrose late last night. The
government will give a “comprehensive public update” before
the House of Commons breaks for Christmas, Ambrose’s office said
in a statement. The legislature is scheduled to adjourn on Dec.
