Tina Maze  of Slovenia won the super-
combined race in St. Moritz, Switzerland, her third World Cup
victory this ski season.  Maze finished in a time of 2 minutes, 1.76 seconds in the
event, which combines separate runs in the Super-G and slalom.
Austriaâ€™s Nicole Hosp was second, 0.88 second behind, while her
team mate Kathrin Zettel took third place at 1.08 seconds back.  Lindsey Vonn  of the U.S., a four-time winner of the overall
title, missed a turn in the slalom and was disqualified.  To contact the reporter on this story:
