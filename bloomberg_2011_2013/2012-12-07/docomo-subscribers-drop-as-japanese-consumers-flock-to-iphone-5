NTT DoCoMo Inc. (9437) , Japan’s biggest
mobile-phone operator, posted the first monthly decline in
subscriptions in more than five years as  Softbank Corp. (9984)  and KDDI
Corp. lured customers with  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone 5.  DoCoMo, the only carrier among Japan’s three biggest
wireless operators that doesn’t offer the iPhone, lost 40,800
net subscribers in November, it said in a statement today.
That’s the first monthly drop since August 2007, according to
data from the  Telecommunications Carriers Association , an
industry group. KDDI and Softbank both posted increases in
subscriptions last month, they said in separate statements.  The decline adds pressure on DoCoMo to offer Apple’s
smartphone after the Tokyo-based carrier cut its estimates for
full-year profit and new subscribers in October. The iPhone 5
topped Japan’s mobile-phone sales  rankings  last month, according
to researcher BCN Inc., helping  KDDI (9433)  and Softbank erode DoCoMo’s
lead in total subscriptions.  “The adoption of the handset by Japan’s largest carrier is
now inevitable,” Amir Anvarzadeh, a Singapore-based manager for
Asia equity sales at  BGC Partners Inc. (BGCP) , said today by e-mail.  DoCoMo rose as much as 3.4 percent, the most since March
16, to 122,200 yen in Tokyo trading after the Nikkei reported
earlier the carrier may consider introducing the iPhone, citing
an unnamed company official. The stock, down 14 percent this
year, traded at 122,000 yen as of 12:49 p.m.  KDDI, Softbank  “IPhones and iPads are very popular and could be
attractive among our line-up if we offered them,” Naoko Minobe,
a spokeswoman for DoCoMo, said today by e-mail. “Nothing has
been decided about our handset portfolio for next year and
after.”  KDDI,  Japan ’s second-largest mobile-phone company, said it
posted a net gain of 228,800 customers last month. Softbank, the
third-biggest, added 301,900.  KDDI shares fell 2.6 percent, trimming their gain this year
to 19 percent. Softbank dropped 2.1 percent and is up 33 percent
in 2012.  DoCoMo had 60.8 million total subscribers at the end of
November, compared with 36.6 million at KDDI and 31 million at
Softbank, according to the companies’ statements.  The iPhone 5, which has a bigger screen, a more lightweight
body design and a faster processor than previous iPhones, went
on sale in Japan in September. DoCoMo added 16 new models last
month, including Samsung’s Galaxy S III and Sony Corp.’s Xperia
AX.  DoCoMo’s net income will increase 9.3 percent from a year
earlier to 507 billion yen ($6.1 billion) in the 12 months
ending March, the company said Oct. 26, lowering its previous
forecast of 557 billion yen. The carrier forecasts subscriber
additions will total 2 million this fiscal year, down from an
earlier estimate of 2.8 million, it said at the time.  Cupertino, California-based Apple ranked second after South
Korea’s  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  in global smartphone shipments
in the three months ended Sept. 30, according to researcher IDC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
