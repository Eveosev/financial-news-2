The  Denver Broncos  defeated the
Oakland Raiders 26-13 to extend their longest winning run in 14
National Football League seasons to eight games.  Joel Dreessen and Knowshon Moreno scored touchdowns for the
Broncos at Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum in Oakland,
 California , last night. Denver, which has already clinched a
second straight American Football Conference West division
title, improved to 10-3, while Oakland dropped to 3-10 with a
sixth straight defeat.  “It’s a good win,” Denver quarterback  Peyton Manning  said
in a televised interview. “I feel like we’ve made some
improvements each week. We’re still looking for that perfect,
four-quarter, 60-minute game.”  The  Houston Texans  lead the AFC with an 11-1 record. The
Broncos are next, followed by the  Baltimore Ravens  and  New
England Patriots , who each have 9-3 marks. Last night’s victory
lifts Denver to 5-0 against AFC West opponents.  The Broncos haven’t won eight consecutive games since
beginning 1998 with 13 victories. They went on to win the  Super
Bowl  that season behind quarterback  John Elway , who is now the
team’s vice president of football operations.  It’s the first time since 2008 the Raiders have lost four
straight home games, while they last went winless for six
consecutive games in 2007.  Family Bereavement  Raiders’ coach Dennis Allen, the defensive coordinator in
Denver last season, returned to Oakland from the Dallas area on
Dec. 5, two days after his father, Grady Allen, died from heart
problems. Grady Allen played 59 games over five years for the
 Atlanta Falcons .  Oakland’s first error came before the game began, when it
won the coin toss and elected to defer. The Broncos took full
advantage as Manning capped a 10-play, 68-yard opening drive
with a 6-yard touchdown pass to Dreessen.  Denver settled for a 43-yard field goal on its next
possession after Manning was sacked on third down for a loss of
11 yards. An interception of Raiders quarterback  Carson Palmer 
led to another field goal for Matt Prater, from 34 yards, at the
start of the second quarter.  Oakland running back Darren McFadden, who missed the past
four games with an ankle sprain, collected a 6-yard pass from
Palmer for a touchdown with two minutes, six minutes remaining
in the first half.  5,000th Pass  On Denver’s next drive, Manning completed his 5,000th
career pass. The 36-year-old four-time NFL Most Valuable Player
ranks second in league history behind  Brett Favre , who found his
target  6,300  times.  In the third quarter, Denver had to settle for a field goal
after winning a first down on Oakland’s 1-yard line.  Manning got the ball back just over a minute later when
Mitch Unrein recovered a fumble by Palmer on Oakland’s 2-yard
line. Moreno drove into the end zone two plays later to make it
23-7 to Denver.  After Prater kicked a 33-yard field goal for Denver at the
end of the third quarter, Darrius Heyward-Bey collected a 56-
yard scoring pass from Palmer for the final score of the game
with 5:47 to play.  In addition to his touchdown, Moreno ran for 119 yards on a
career-high 32 carries and also had four receptions for 48
yards.  Manning completed 26 of 36 passes for 310 yards, one
touchdown and one interception. He’s thrown for 300 yards or
more in a league-record 70 games.  Palmer completed 19 of 30 passes for 273 yards, two
touchdowns and one interception.  To contact the reporter on this story:
