Azerbaijanâ€™s central bank lowered its
benchmark  interest rate  to help stimulate growth outside the oil
industry after crude production fell.  The bank cut the rate to 5 percent from 5.25 percent
effective Dec. 10, it said today in an e-mailed statement.  Oil output in the Caspian Sea nation, the third-largest
crude producer in the former  Soviet Union , dropped 7.7 percent
to 36 million metric tons in the first 10 months of the year, it
said last month. Production declined 10 percent in 2011.  The non-oil economy, which President Ilham Aliyev is
seeking to double in the next decade, expanded 10.4 percent in
January through October, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
