Chilean breakeven inflation rates
plunged after a government report showed consumer prices dropped
unexpectedly in November.  The one-year breakeven rate fell the most since July,
decreasing 20 basis points, or 0.20 percentage point, to 2.32
percent at the close of trading in Santiago. The two-year rate
fell 12 basis points to 2.71 percent. Breakeven inflation rates
are derived from the gap between the fixed-rate yields and
inflation-linked yields on derivatives linked to  interest rates .  The National Statistics Institute today reported that
consumer prices fell 0.5 percent in November. The median
forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey was for no change.
Traders in the forwards market for unidades de fomento,  Chile ’s
inflation-linked accounting unit, had projected a 0.25 percent
drop.  “The number was a major surprise,” said Enzo Sepulveda, a
forwards trader at Banco Santander Chile in Santiago. “Short-
term prices are falling, but implied inflation for future months
is more or less the same.”  The yield on  five-year  inflation-linked bonds climbed 12
basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 2.77 percent, the
highest since July 2011.  Annual inflation will slow below the central bank’s target
range of 2 percent to 3 percent this month and drop as low as
1.42 percent in February, according to traders in the forwards
market for unidades de fomento.  The peso was little changed at 476.99 per  U.S. dollar .  To contact the reporter on this story:
