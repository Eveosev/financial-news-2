The Slovak central bank lowered its
2013 economic- growth  forecast to 1.6 percent from 2 percent,
citing weakening exports and domestic demand.  The projection for 2012 gross domestic product growth was
cut to 2.4 percent from the 2.7 percent predicted three months
ago, according to a quarterly forecast released by Governor
Jozef Makuch at a press conference today in the capital,
Bratislava. The bank kept its GDP growth outlook for 2014 at 3.5
percent as domestic demand revives, he said.  Even as the Slovak economy has been weathering  Europe â€™s
crisis better than its peers, the outlook remains uncertain, the
central bank said. Domestic demand in  Slovakia , which adopted
the euro in 2009, will weaken because of austerity measures and
persistent unemployment, which has failed to fall as companies
streamline operations to remain competitive.  The economy advanced 0.6 percent in the third quarter from
the previous three months, among the fastest in the European
Union, compared with a 0.1 percent contraction in the bloc of 17
nations sharing the euro. It grew 3.3 percent in 2011.  The European Commission in its November forecast predicted
the Slovak economy will expand 2.6 percent this year, the
fastest pace in the euro area, and 2 percent in 2013.  The central bank also lowered its projection for average
 inflation  in 2013 to 2.3 percent from 2.4 percent. Price growth
is set to slow to 1.9 percent in 2014, according to the bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
