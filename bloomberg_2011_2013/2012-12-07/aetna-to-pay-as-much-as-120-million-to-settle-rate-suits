Aetna Inc., (AET)  the third-largest U.S.
health insurer, agreed to pay as much as $120 million to settle
lawsuits over its reimbursement for treatment by out-of-network
doctors.  The company will pay $60 million to a general settlement
fund and as much as $60 million more depending on how many
settlement class members submit valid claims. The agreement
covers out-of-network providers and provider groups from June 3,
2003, and plan members from March 1, 2001, according to court
papers filed today in federal court in Newark,  New Jersey .  Subscribers and providers sued Aetna beginning in 2007
alleging that it improperly used a third-party database,
Ingenix, to underpay claims for services provided to plan
members by out-of-network providers.  Aetna, based in Hartford, Connecticut, paid $20 million in
2009 to resolve an investigation of reimbursement rates by the
 New York  attorney general at the time,  Andrew Cuomo . Ingenix,
which insurers used to help determine customary costs for
claims, was shut down by its parent UnitedHealth Group Inc. as a
result of the probe.  The settlement announced today is subject to court
approval.  The case is In re Aetna UCR Litigation, 07-cv-03541, U.S.
District Court, District of New Jersey (Newark).  To contact the reporter on this story:
