China’s stocks  rose, capping the
benchmark index’s biggest weekly gain in 13 months, before the
release of data this weekend that may show economic growth is
stabilizing.  Anhui Conch Cement Co. led a rally for cement producers
after China’s new leader  Xi Jinping  reiterated the government
will promote urban development.  Kweichow Moutai Co. (600519)  jumped 2.4
percent, snapping a five-day losing streak, after the biggest
maker of baijiu liquor said it doesn’t put additives during
production. Citic Securities Co. and Haitong Securities Co.
climbed at least 2 percent after stock trading volumes surged
and the  Shanghai  Securities News said the regulator is studying
ways to expand brokerages’ financing channels.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 1.6 percent to 2,061.79
at the close, the highest level since Nov. 12. It advanced 4.1
percent this week after sinking to the lowest since January 2009
on Dec. 3. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  added 2 percent to 2,246.76. The
 Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  gained 0.9 percent.  “November data may continue to show the economic recovery
is on track, helped by increases in infrastructure investment
and property sales,” said Dai Ming, a  fund manager  at Hengsheng
Hongding Asset Management Co. in Shanghai, which manages $190
million. “More investors have reached a consensus that the
economy has reached a bottom in the short term.”  China’s industrial production probably accelerated for a
third month to 9.8 percent from a year earlier, while retail
sales probably rose 14.6 percent, the most since March,
according to median estimates in Bloomberg News surveys. The
figures are due Dec. 9. Credit Suisse Group AG boosted its
forecasts for Chinese economic growth this year and next, saying
the economy has stabilized and the risk of hard landing has
abated, according to a report yesterday from economist Dong Tao.  Fiscal Policies  The Shanghai measure has fallen 6.3 percent this year,
making it the worst-performing major market in  Asia  amid concern
 China’s economy  will grow at its slowest pace in more than a
decade this year. The measure  trades  at 11.4 times reported
earnings, compared with 10.8 set on Dec. 3, the lowest since at
least 1997, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China will continue proactive fiscal and prudent monetary
policies, while promoting economic restructuring and
urbanization, Xi was cited as saying by the official  China
Central Television  yesterday. The Shanghai index had its biggest
rally in three months on Dec. 5 as construction and cement
stocks surged after the first meeting by the ruling party under
Xi signaled increased urban development.  Cement Stocks  A group of  material stocks  in the CSI 300 advanced 2.4
percent today, the second-most among the 10 industry groups.
Anhui Conch, China’s biggest cement maker, advanced 1.6 percent
to 17.70  yuan . It rallied seven out of eight days with a
cumulative 14 percent gain.  Credit Suisse boosted Anhui Conch’s Hong Kong stock rating
to neutral from underperform and raised earnings estimates for

five-day slide. The liquor maker said its materials used during
production as well as products meet national standards. The
shares have been hurt by speculation that some consumers sent
samples of its white spirit to a food safety agency run by the
Hong Kong government to test for plasticizer levels, according
to Liu Wei, an analyst at Masterlink Securities Corp.  Wuliangye Yibin Co. (000858) , China’s second-biggest maker of white
