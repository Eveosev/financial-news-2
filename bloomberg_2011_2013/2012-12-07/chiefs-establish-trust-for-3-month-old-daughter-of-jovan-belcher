The  Kansas City Chiefs  created a  trust fund  for Zoey Michelle Belcher, the daughter of the National Football League player who killed himself and his girlfriend last week.  UMB Bank in  Kansas City  will administer the trust, which was established through contributions from players and the Hunt family which owns the team, the Chiefs said in a news release.  “As we continue to struggle with the emotional pain from the tragedy, the Chiefs family is focused on helping 3-month-old Zoey Michelle Belcher as she faces the challenge of growing up without the support of her parents,” Clark Hunt, the team’s chairman, said in a news release. “Zoey will always be part of the Chiefs family and we hope this trust will help ensure she has the resources necessary as she grows up.”  Linebacker Jovan Belcher killed himself at Arrowhead Stadium Dec. 1 after fatally shooting his girlfriend Kasandra Perkins.
