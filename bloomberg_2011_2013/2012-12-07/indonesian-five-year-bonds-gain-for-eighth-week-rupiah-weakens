Indonesia ’s five-year bonds gained
for an eighth week, the longest winning streak since April 2010,
as the second-highest yields in Asia attracted funds from
abroad. The rupiah weakened.  Global funds added 2.23 trillion rupiah ($232 million) to
their holdings of local-currency sovereign debt in the first two
trading days of this month, following a record 19.5 trillion
rupiah increase in November, official data show. Bank Indonesia
will maintain its benchmark  interest rate  at a record-low 5.75
percent for a 10th month when it meets on Dec. 11, according to
all 18 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent bonds maturing in
July 2017 fell six basis points this week, or 0.06 percentage
point, to 4.92 percent as of 3:46 p.m. in Jakarta, prices from
the Inter Dealer Market Association show. Among 13 Asia-Pacific
debt markets tracked by Bloomberg, only  India ’s five-year yield
of 8.11 percent is higher. Similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries
yield 0.60 percent.  “Capital inflows can continue as investors seek yield and
rates are likely to remain stable until the end of the year,”
said Billie Fuliangsahar, the Jakarta-based head of treasury at
PT Bank Rabobank International Indonesia. “The tendency for the
rupiah to decline is still strong due to demand for dollars and
the weak trade position.”  Trade Balance  Indonesia’s trade balance swung to a record deficit of $1.5
billion in October, from a revised surplus of $549.5 million the
previous month, official data show. This year’s  current-account
deficit  may be equivalent to 2.2 percent of gross domestic
product, the highest proportion since at least 1997, Bank
Indonesia Governor Darmin Nasution said yesterday.  The rupiah fell 0.3 percent this week to 9,620 per dollar,
after earlier reaching 9,675, the lowest level since October
2009, prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg show. The
currency weakened 0.1 percent today.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, climbed five basis
points this week to 4.65 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
