inhabited by the characters of Prokofiev’s “Peter and the

Wanna Be Your Man” to “Doom and Gloom” from 2012. Of course,

and red cabbage.  At 25 Lafayette Ave. Information: +1-718-222-5800.  Sunday  Grab a swing and become part of Ann Hamilton’s large-scale
installation at the Park Avenue Armory.  An enormous white cloth divides the Drill Hall and
undulates with every movement of a swing, so via ropes and
pulleys you are connected to all the other participants in
determining what happens in your immediate environment.  Adding to the fun are readers, vocalists and a group of
trained homing pigeons.  “The Event of a Thread” runs through Jan. 6 at the
Armory, 643 Park Ave. Information: +1-212-616-3930;

decorated with scrolls, flowers and lions and Matthew McCaslin’s
site-specific piece with a contemporary spin on the ceremonial
object.  At 1109 Fifth Ave. Information: +1-212-423-3200;
