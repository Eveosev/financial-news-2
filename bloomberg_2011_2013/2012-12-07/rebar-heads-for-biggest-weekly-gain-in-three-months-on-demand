Steel reinforcement-bar futures
advanced, set for the biggest weekly increase in almost three
months, as a strengthening Chinese economy may boost demand.  Rebar for May delivery rose as much as 1.5 percent to 3,647
yuan ($585) a metric ton on the  Shanghai  Futures Exchange,
before trading at 3,634 yuan by 11:30 a.m. local time. Futures
have climbed 4 percent this week, the biggest such gain since
the week ended Sept. 14.  The average spot price of rebar, used in housing
construction and infrastructure projects, jumped for a fourth
day, according to data from Beijing Antaike  Information
Development Co. (4709)  There is growing “enthusiasm” for urbanization
projects in the southwest after the country’s leaders signaled
there may be more pro-growth policies, Shenyin Wanguo Futures
Co. said in a report today.  “If you look at daily production right now, it’s higher
than last year,” Shenyin’s analyst Yu Yang said by phone from
Shanghai. “We find steel companies are rather firm on their
prices as they anticipate stronger demand,” she said.  Production nationwide has averaged about 1.9 million tons
per day since October, compared with 1.6 million tons last year,
Yu said, citing her analysis. Steel makers enjoy some profits
now and expect continued improvement, she said.  Rebar for  immediate delivery  climbed 0.2 percent to 3,552
 yuan  a ton yesterday, Beijing Antaike’s data show. Spot iron ore
advanced 0.4 percent to $118.40 a dry ton at Tianjin port
yesterday, according to data from The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
