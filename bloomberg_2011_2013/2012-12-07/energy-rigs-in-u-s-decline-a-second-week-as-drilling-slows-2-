Natural gas and oil rigs in the U.S.
declined for a second week as energy producers slowed crude
drilling and a rally in gas failed to push prices high enough to
draw new plays.  The  gas rig count  dropped by seven to 417, according to
data posted on  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI) ’s website, near the 13-year low
of 413 reached Nov. 9, the Houston-based company’s data showed.
The total U.S.  energy rig count  fell by 11 to 1,800, a five-week
low.  Oil rigs  dropped by four to 1,382, the third decline in a
row.  Natural gas rigs rose in November for the first time in 13
months as nuclear power plant outages helped support a rally in
gas futures. The total is down to less than a third of its peak
of 1,606 in August 2008 as energy producers focused on more
lucrative gas-liquids and oil drilling.  “Although we are not planning for a meaningful improvement
in natural gas prices, should prices improve next year, the
entire North American market has a potential to shift
overnight,” Peter A. Ragauss, Baker Hughes’ chief financial
officer, said at a conference in  New York  hosted by Dahlman Rose
& Co. Dec. 4.  Natural gas prices are expected to rise to an average of
$3.70 per million British thermal units in 2013, Biliana Pehlivanova, an analyst for  Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s investment-banking
unit in New York, said in a note to clients Dec. 4.  Prices ‘Weak’  Natural gas for January delivery dropped 11.5 cents to
settle at $3.551 per million British thermal units on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . Prices are up 19 percent this year.  “Natural gas prices are still too weak to justify drilling
for most producers in most formations,”  James Williams ,
president of WTRG Economics in  London ,  Arkansas , said by
telephone. “It takes about $4 gas to make it worth drilling for
half of them, and $4.50 gas for the other half.”  Crude for January delivery on the Nymex fell 33 cents to
$85.93.  Oil prices  are down 13 percent for the year.  Alaska lost the most rigs this week, dropping four to four.
Arkansas, Colorado and  Pennsylvania  each gained one.  Rigs on land  tumbled by nine to 1,732.  Rigs in inland
waters  were unchanged at 20, the highest level since August.
 Miscellaneous rigs , which primarily drill for geothermal energy,
were also unchanged at one.  Vertical rigs  slipped by two to 506. Horizontal rigs
declined by seven to 1,103.  The  offshore rig count  lost two to 48. Rigs in the  Gulf of
Mexico  were unchanged at 48.  Canadian energy rigs  gained for a fourth week, rising by
seven to 406, the highest level since March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
