The ruble posted the biggest gain
versus the euro in more than two months as the single European
currency extended its decline after weak production figures from
 Germany  and stronger than expected U.S. employment data.  The ruble strengthened 0.7 percent versus the euro to
39.8775 by the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, the biggest jump since
Sept. 27. It advanced 0.4 percent versus the Russian central
bank’s euro-dollar target basket to 34.9358. The Russian
currency gained less than 0.1 percent against the dollar to
30.8925 and was little changed in the week.  The euro weakened for a third day after German industrial
production fell 2.6 percent from September, when it declined 1.3
percent, the  Economy Ministry  said today. Germany’s economy,
 Europe ’s largest, will contract in the fourth quarter and
stagnate in the first three months of next year due to a
recession in the euro area and slower global growth, the
Bundesbank said today.  U.S. payrolls rose more than anticipated in November and
the jobless rate slumped to an almost four-year low, indicating
superstorm Sandy had a marginal effect on the U.S. labor market.  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.3383 per
dollar in three months, compared with 31.3920 yesterday.  The extra yield investors demand to own  Russia ’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries fell four basis points to 190,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index
of five-year government bond yields dropped nine basis points to
6.4710 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
