The BP Plc-led Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan
oil pipeline shipped less Azeri crude in the first 11 months of
the year, according to  State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan , a partner in
the venture.  The so-called BTC link, which connects  Azerbaijan ’s Caspian
Sea coast with Turkey’s Mediterranean port of Ceyhan via
Georgia, delivered 27.3 million metric tons in the period, a
decline of 9.1 percent from a year earlier, the Baku-based
company said today on its website. BTC exported 2.2 million tons
in November, up from 2.1 million tons a year earlier.  BP is also a partner in Azerbaijan’s Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli
oilfield, which accounted for 78 percent of the nation’s output
last year. A 12 percent decline in ACG’s production in the first
half of 2012 prompted criticism of BP from Azeri President  Ilham
Aliyev , who called on the company to fix “grave mistakes.”  Azerbaijan is the third-largest oil producer in the former
 Soviet Union , after Russia and Kazakhstan. Its BTC link has
shipped more than 203 million tons of oil since starting in
2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
