South African corn declined to the
lowest in more than two weeks as rain continues to fall in
growing areas, boosting prospects for next season’s crop. The
price in the U.S. also dropped.  Yellow corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
decreased 1 percent to 2,302 rand ($264) a metric ton by the
close on the South African Futures Exchange in Johannesburg, the
lowest since Nov. 21. The white variety for March delivery fell
0.1 percent to 2,458 rand a ton.  Bothaville in Free State province is partly cloudy and warm
with scattered thundershowers today. The area has a 93 percent
chance of rain today, 75 percent tomorrow and a 22 percent
chance on Dec. 9, the  South African Weather Service  said on its
website. The province produces 40 percent of the country’s
grain.  “Much of the areas that needed it have been receiving good
rain,” Thys Grobbelaar, an analyst at Klerksdorp, South Africa-
based Senwes Ltd., said by phone. “This can lead to good yields
and good stocks, so that is why prices are affected
negatively.”  U.S. corn for delivery in March fell 0.4 percent to $7.4825
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  South Africa  is the continent’s largest producer of corn,
where it is known as maize. Meal made from the white variety is
one of the country’s staple foods, while yellow corn is mainly
used as  animal feed .  Wheat for delivery in March was little changed at 3,740
rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
