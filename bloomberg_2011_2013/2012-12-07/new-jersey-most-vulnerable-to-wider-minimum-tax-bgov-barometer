Half of the taxpayers in  New Jersey 
are vulnerable to paying more for 2012 if Congress fails to
prevent an alternative tax from snaring people below the top
income brackets it originally targeted.  Without action by Congress, the number of taxpayers subject
to the alternative minimum tax for 2012 would jump to 32.4
million from 4 million in 2010,  Congressional Research Service 
figures show.  The BGOV Barometer shows New Jersey AMT returns would
increase to 50 percent from 6.4 percent two years ago as a share
of all federal income tax filings by the state’s residents,
according to CRS and  Internal Revenue Service  data. More than 40
percent of federal taxpayers in  Connecticut  and  New York  would
be subject to the alternative tax unless Congress acts.  The AMT requires taxpayers above certain income levels to
figure their liability a second time under a separate set of
rules that disallow or limit some exemptions and deductions and
then pay whatever tax is higher. The system isn’t indexed for
inflation, so Congress periodically adjusts the system to ensure
it targets only the highest earners. This year the adjustment is
part of congressional negotiations to avert more than $600
billion of tax increases and spending cuts before next year.  “If Congress doesn’t fix this by Jan. 1, you and I don’t
know what our taxes are,”  Leonard Burman , a professor at
 Syracuse University  in New York, said yesterday in a telephone
interview. He said that the so-called fiscal cliff negotiations
are making it harder. “If it were just the AMT, Congress would
have fixed it and gone home by now. It wouldn’t surprise me at
all if we don’t resolve this until January.”  Disproportionate Effect  The AMT disproportionately affects taxpayers with large
families and those in high-tax states such as New York and New
Jersey. State and local taxes can’t be deducted by AMT-paying
households.  If Congress fails to act, New Jersey would see its number
of AMT payers jump to 2.2 million for 2012 from 275,000 two
years ago, according to Congressional Research Service  data . The
IRS projects New Jersey residents will file 4.4 million returns
for 2012.  In Connecticut, where 5.6 percent of taxpayers paid the AMT
two years ago, the CRS report projects the number subject to the
tax would rise to 777,000, or 44 percent of the 2012 returns
projected by the IRS. New York, where 5.3 percent were subject
to the AMT in 2010, would see 3.9 million paying the higher tax
for 2012, or 41 percent of 2012 returns, the CRS projections
show.  Burman, who used to be director of the nonpartisan  Tax
Policy Center  in  Washington , said that for people with incomes
in 2011 dollars between $200,000 and $500,000 the average tax
bill would have gone up by $5,856 without the patch. That amount
would have been $2,897 for those with incomes between $100,000
and $200,000.  Shrinking Refunds  If Congress doesn’t fix the AMT, tax collections would
increase by $92 billion, shrinking or erasing many taxpayers’
expected refunds. Congressional inaction would also create
processing delays for the Internal Revenue Service, which has
its computer systems programmed on the assumption that Congress
would prevent the AMT’s expansion.  “Taxpayers and the IRS need to know what the tax
provisions are for 2012 so that you know what you owe and we
know how to process your return in January,”  Steven Miller ,
acting commissioner of the IRS, said at a tax conference
yesterday in Washington.  Congress created the forerunner of the AMT in 1969 in
response to reports that 155 high-income taxpayers owed no
income taxes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
