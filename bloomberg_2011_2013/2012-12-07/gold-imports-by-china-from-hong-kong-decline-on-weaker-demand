Gold imports by  China  from Hong Kong
dropped 32 percent in October from a month earlier as slowing
economic growth cut purchases.  Mainland China bought 47,478 kilograms (47.478 metric tons),
including scrap and coins, compared with 69,712 kilograms in
September. Shipments were 45 percent less than the 86,314
kilograms a year earlier, data from the Census and Statistics
Department of the  Hong Kong government show .  Gold, which slipped 2.9 percent in October, is in the 12th
year of a bull run as investors seek to hedge against weaker
currencies as central banks around the world take action to
boost economic growth. China’s gross domestic product is poised
to expand 7.7 percent this year, the weakest pace since 1999,
according to a Bloomberg survey. Growth was 7.4 percent in the
three months through September, the weakest in three years.  Shipments more than doubled to 629,326.5 kilograms in the
first 10 months from 289,960.6 kilograms a year earlier,
Bloomberg calculations show. Net imports, excluding flows from
China to  Hong Kong , were 23,844 kilograms in October from
41,559.5 kilograms last month. China doesn’t publish such data.  Exports of gold to Hong Kong from China were 23,634
kilograms in October, down from 28,152.5 kilograms in September,
according to  a separate statistics  department statement.
Shipments were more than the 7,573 kilograms a year ago. They
were 252,178 kilograms in the first 10 months from 75,927
kilograms a year earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations.  Gold for immediate delivery was little changed at $1,700.06
an ounce at 5:16 p.m. in Singapore, taking gains this year to
8.7 percent. Holdings in gold-backed exchange-traded products
expanded to an all-time high on Dec. 5, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter for this story:
