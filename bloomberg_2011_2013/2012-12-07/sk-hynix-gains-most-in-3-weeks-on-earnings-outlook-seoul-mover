SK Hynix Inc. (000660) , the world’s second-
largest maker of computer memory chips, jumped the most in more
than three weeks in  Seoul  trading on speculation quarterly
earnings will exceed analysts’ estimates.  The stock  climbed  4 percent to 25,850 won as of 10:45 a.m.
on the Korea Exchange, poised for its steepest gain since Nov.
14. The benchmark  Kospi index  added 0.4 percent.  Fourth-quarter operating profit may be 202 billion won
($186 million), compared with a consensus estimate of 147
billion won, Taurus Investment & Securities Co. said. The
company posted an  operating  loss of 15 billion won in the third
quarter.  “Profitability will significantly improve,” helped by
prices of NAND flash chips for mobile devices and cost
reductions, Kim Hyung Sik, a Seoul-based analyst at Taurus
Investment, wrote in a report today. He raised the share-price
estimate by 6.5 percent to 33,000 won and maintained a buy
recommendation.  SK Hynix is also befitting as bigger competitor  Samsung
Electronics Co. (005930)  is engaged in a prolonged legal battle, the
analyst said.  Samsung and  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  are in the midst of patent-
infringement lawsuits around the world. Samsung is one of
Apple’s biggest component  suppliers  and its chief rival in the
smartphone and tablet markets.  SK Hynix also advanced after the price of the benchmark
dynamic random access memory chips rallied 7 percent yesterday.  Today’s climb boosted Hynix’s  gain  this year to 18 percent,
compared with a 7.3 percent advance for the Kospi. Samsung has
surged 40 percent in the same period.  -- With assistance from Shinhye Kang in Seoul. Editors:  Garry
