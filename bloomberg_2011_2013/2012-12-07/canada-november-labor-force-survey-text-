Following is the text of  Canada ’s
labor force survey released by Statistics Canada.  Following little change in October, employment rose by
59,000 in November, the result of an increase in full-time work.
The unemployment rate declined 0.2 percentage points to 7.2%.  Compared with 12 months earlier, employment increased 1.7%
or 294,000, mostly in full-time work. Over the same period, the
total number of hours worked rose 1.3%.  In November, employment increased in Ontario, Quebec,
 Alberta , Manitoba and Prince  Edward Island . There was little
change in the other provinces.  The number of private sector employees rose by 48,000 in
November, while there was little change in public sector
employment and self-employment.  Year over year, employment gains totaled 187,000 (+1.7%)
among private sector employees, while public sector employment
increased by 76,000 (+2.1%). Over the same period, the number of
self-employed was virtually unchanged.  Among industries, employment increases in November occurred
in accommodation and food services; retail and wholesale trade;
professional, scientific and technical services; and agriculture.
There were fewer workers, however, in manufacturing and ‘other
services’ such as civic and professional organizations, personal
services and repair and maintenance.  In November, employment increased among women aged 25 to 54
and youths aged 15 to 24.  Provincial summary  Employment in Ontario rose by 32,000 in November, and the
unemployment rate declined 0.4 percentage points to 7.9%.
Compared with 12 months earlier, employment in the province was
up 1.3%, all in full time, but below the national growth rate of
1.7%.  Employment in  Quebec  rose by 18,000, continuing an upward
trend that began in August. The unemployment rate was 7.6% in
November. Compared with 12 months earlier, employment growth in
the province was 2.8%.  In November, employment rose by 10,000 in Alberta. At the
same time, the unemployment rate declined 0.3 percentage points
to 4.2%, the lowest among all provinces. Year-over-year
employment growth in the province was 1.8%.  Employment in Manitoba increased by 5,500 in November,
pushing the unemployment rate down 0.3 percentage points to 5.3%.
Compared with 12 months earlier, employment in the province grew
by 1.4%.  While employment in Newfoundland and Labrador was little
changed in November, it increased 3.8% on a year-over-year basis,
all in full time, and the highest growth rate among the
provinces.  Industry perspective  In November, there were more people working in
accommodation and food services, up 28,000, bringing employment
in this industry back to a level similar to November 2011.  Employment in retail and wholesale trade rose by 25,000 in
November. Recent increases were offset by declines earlier in
the year, leaving employment in this industry similar to the
level observed 12 months earlier.  There were more people working in professional, scientific
and technical services in November, up 23,000. On a year-over-
year basis, employment in the industry was little changed.  Employment in agriculture rose by 9,000 in November, partly
offsetting a decline the month before. Agricultural employment
is now at about the same level as 12 months earlier.  Following five months of little change, the number of
workers in manufacturing declined by 20,000 in November. Despite
this decrease, the number of factory workers rose 4.1% on a
year-over-year basis, with most of the gains observed earlier
this year.  In November, there were 15,000 fewer people employed in
‘other services’. Compared with 12 months earlier, employment in
this industry was little changed.  More women aged 25 to 54 and youths employed in November  Employment in November rose by 33,000 for core-aged people
(25 to 54), particularly women (+23,000). On a year-over-year
basis, employment among women aged 25 to 54 rose by 66,000
(+1.2%), similar to the increase for core-aged men (+68,000 or
+1.1%).  Employment among youths aged 15 to 24 increased by 16,000
in November, and their unemployment rate fell 0.7 percentage
points to 14.0%. With this increase, the employment level for
this group was similar to that of 12 months earlier.  Although employment among persons aged 55 and over was
little changed in November, it increased by 183,000 (+5.9%) on a
year-over-year basis, driven in part by population aging.  Note to readers  The Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates are based on a
sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. As a
result, monthly estimates will show more variability than trends
observed over longer time periods. Estimates for smaller
geographic areas or industries also have more variability. For
an explanation of sampling variability of estimates and how to
use standard errors to assess this variability, consult the
‘Estimates quality’ section of the publication Labour Force
Information (71-001-X, free).  The employment rate is the number of employed persons as a
percentage of the population 15 years of age and over. The rate
for a particular group (for example, youth aged 15 to 24) is the
number employed in that group as a percentage of the population
for that group.  The unemployment rate is the number unemployed as a
percentage of the labour force (employed and unemployed).  The participation rate is the number of employed and
unemployed as a percentage of the population. For more detailed
information, see the Guide to the Labour Force Survey (71-543-G,
free).  Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally
adjusted estimates, which facilitates comparisons by removing
the effects of seasonal variations. For more information on
seasonal adjustment, see Seasonal adjustment and identifying
economic trends ( http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/bsolc/olc-cel/colc -
cel?catno=11-010-X201000311141&amp;lang=fra) .  Revision  Seasonally adjusted estimates from the LFS will be revised
using the latest seasonal factors, going back three years
(January 2010 onwards). The revised estimates will be available
on CANSIM (tables 282-0087 to 282-0094, 282-0100, 282-0116 and
282-0117) on February 1, 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
