New Zealand Cricket named Brendan
McCullum as captain of its Twenty20 and Test squads to tour
South Africa this month, replacing Ross Taylor who has
subsequently declared himself unavailable.  The Test squad contains four new faces from the recent tour
of Sri Lanka with Dean Brownlee and Peter Fulton added as
batsmen, BJ Watling replacing Kruger van Wyk as test
wicketkeeper and Bruce Martin selected as second spin bowler
rather than leg-spinner Todd Astle, according to an e-mailed
statement.  The Twenty20 squad includes Corey Anderson, Mitchell
McClenaghan, Derek de Boorder, Colin Munro and Jimmy Neesham at
international level for the first time.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
