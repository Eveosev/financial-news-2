Portugal’s economy shrank for an
eighth quarter in the three months through September as the
government and consumers reduced spending.  Gross domestic product  declined 0.9 percent from the second
quarter, when it fell 1 percent, the Lisbon-based National
Statistics Institute said in an e-mailed statement today. The
institute had said in a preliminary report on Nov. 14 that GDP
dropped 0.8 percent from the second quarter. GDP fell 3.5
percent from a year earlier.  Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  is battling rising
joblessness and a deepening recession as he cuts spending and
raises taxes to meet the terms of a 78 billion-euro ($101
billion) aid plan from the euro area and the  International
Monetary Fund . Portugal has already been given more time to
narrow its budget shortfall after  tax revenue  missed forecasts.
The economy is headed for a third year of contraction in 2013.  Exports fell 0.2 percent in the third quarter from the
previous three months, today’s report showed. Household spending
slipped 0.3 percent and  government spending  decreased 1.9
percent in the period.  The recession is hurting tax receipts, and the government’s
revenue from tax and social-security contributions this year
will be about 3.3 billion euros less than planned in the budget,
Finance Minister Vitor Gaspar said on Oct. 3.  Deficit Targets  Portugal  aims to reach a deficit of 5 percent of GDP in
2012 and 4.5 percent in 2013. It will only cut the deficit below
the EU’s 3 percent limit in 2014, when it targets a 2.5 percent
gap. The government forecasts debt will rise to 120 percent of
gross domestic product this year before  peaking  at 122.3 percent
of GDP in 2014.  Gaspar on Oct. 3 said the government will implement an
“enormous” increase in taxes on wages and other income to meet
 deficit  targets in 2013. The government also plans to cut
spending by about 4 billion euros in the two years through 2014.  The government projects GDP will shrink 1 percent in 2013
after contracting 3 percent this year.  Economic growth  has
averaged less than 1 percent a year for the past decade, placing
Portugal among  Europe ’s weakest performers. The government
predicts the  unemployment rate  will rise to 16.4 percent in 2013
from 15.5 percent this year.  Brisa-Auto Estradas de Portugal SA , Portugal’s biggest
highway operator, said on Oct. 31 that toll revenue declined 9.8
percent in the first nine months of the year. Portuguese light-
vehicle sales fell 40 percent in the 11 months through November
compared with the same period in 2011, the Portuguese Automobile
Association said on Dec. 3.  The number of Portuguese building companies that declared
insolvency rose 49 percent in the first nine months of the year,
a trade group said on Oct. 29. The contraction was caused by an
“unprecedented” decline in new projects in the country, the
Fepicop group said in a report. Cement consumption declined 26
percent in the nine months through September, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
