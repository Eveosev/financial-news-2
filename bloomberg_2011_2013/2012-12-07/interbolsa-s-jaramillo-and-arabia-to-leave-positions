Shareholders in Interbolsa SA fired
Chief Executive Officer Rodrigo Jaramillo and Chief Financial
Officer Jorge Arabia, after the group’s brokerage collapsed last
month.  The shareholders also refused to accept the resignations of
Interbolsa’s board members, the company said in a regulatory
filing. Seven members of the board quit on Nov. 2.  Finance Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  said Nov. 7 that
regulators would liquidate Interbolsa’s brokerage after it had
failed to meet a loan payment a week earlier.  In the minutes to its November board published today,
 Colombia ’s central bank cited a high “risk perception of some
local agents” in its unexpected decision to cut  interest rates 
last month. Policy makers cut the benchmark rate to 4.5 percent
from 4.75 percent Nov. 23, surprising 31 of 33 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
