News Corp. (NWSA) ’s plan to shut down its
electronic newspaper The Daily, a move announced earlier this
week, will affect 126 jobs, according to a state filing.  News Corp. set a closing date of March 5 for paper,
according to the  filing  with the state of New York.  The company said on Dec. 3 that it would close The Daily,
part of its plan to break up News Corp. into publishing and
entertainment arms. The electronic publication, started in early
2011 to capitalize on the popularity of tablets, has struggled
to attract subscribers.  When The Daily started, News Corp. Chief Executive Officer
Rupert Murdoch said it would need 500,000 subscribers to reach
profitability. The Daily had about 100,000 earlier this year.  The Daily’s editor-in-chief, Jesse Angelo, will become
publisher of News Corp.’s  New York  Post, the company said
earlier this week. Paul Carlucci, now the Post’s publisher, will
focus exclusively on his role as chairman of News America
Marketing.  Jennifer Tartikoff, a spokeswoman for The Daily, didn’t
immediately respond to a request for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
