Butch Jones will become the
 University of Tennessee ’s 24th head football coach, departing
the University of Cincinnati after three seasons.  The 44-year-old will be introduced at an afternoon news
conference on the Knoxville,  Tennessee , school’s campus, it said
on its website.  The hiring, which came after Jones turned down an offer to
coach at  Colorado , includes a six-year contract, ESPN reported.  Jones resigned, effective immediately, Cincinnati Athletic
Director Whit Babcock said on the school’s website.  “I would like to thank Butch Jones for his time at the
University of Cincinnati,” Babcock said in a statement. “With
that said, we are excited about the future of this program and
this job will be extremely attractive nationally. Our search
will begin immediately.”  Jones replaces Derek Dooley, who was fired Nov. 18
following a 41-18 loss at Vanderbilt that left the Volunteers at
4-7 for the season. Offensive coordinator Jim Chaney was the
interim head coach for the season finale, a 37-17 win over
 Kentucky .  Cincinnati tied for first place in Big East Conference play
the past two seasons. After a 10-3 finish last season, the
Bearcats are 9-3 this year with an invitation to play Duke in
the Belk Bowl on Dec. 27 in  Charlotte , North Carolina.  Jones went 23-14 at Cincinnati and is 50-27 in six years as
a head coach, having also led Central Michigan from 2007-2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
