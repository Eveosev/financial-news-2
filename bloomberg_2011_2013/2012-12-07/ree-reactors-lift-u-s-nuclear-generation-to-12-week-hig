U.S. nuclear-power generation climbed
to a 12-week high as an Illinois unit started after refueling
and reactors in Alabama and  South Carolina  increased output.  U.S. generation  gained 1.3 percent to 90,143 megawatts, or
88 percent of capacity, the most since Sept. 14, according to
Nuclear Regulatory Commission data compiled by Bloomberg.
Production, which has risen for 11 straight days, was 5.5
percent lower than a  year earlier  with 11 of the 104 U.S.
reactors offline.  Generation at Dresden 3, the 867-megawatt  Exelon Corp. (EXC)  unit
48 miles southwest of  Chicago , increased to 66 percent of
capacity from 20 percent. The reactor was removed from service
on Nov. 12 to replace one-third of its fuel, the company said.  Scana Corp. (SCG)  started the 966-megawatt Summer reactor in
South Carolina, shut on Oct. 13 for refueling. Two reactor
vessel head penetrations also had to be repaired because they
didn’t meet requirements, according to an Oct. 24 NRC  report .  Summer, 26 miles (42 kilometers) northwest of Columbia, was
operating at 2 percent of capacity early today.  TVA Output  The  Tennessee Valley Authority  boosted output at the 1,065-
megawatt Browns Ferry 1 in  Alabama  to 89 percent. Production was
cut to 23 percent two days earlier to replace a regulator fuse
box, Mike Bradley, a spokesman for the agency, said in a
telephone interview.  “We expect to be up at full power this afternoon, probably
by 5 p.m. Central,” he said. The plant is about 84 miles north
of Birmingham.  Increased production from Summer and Browns Ferry boosted
output in the Southeast by 786 megawatts to 26,568 megawatts, or
84 percent of capacity, the most since Sept. 15, NRC data show.
Output is down 9.8 percent from a year earlier.  Midwest generation increased by 388 megawatts with Dresden
3 to 18,792, or 88 percent of capacity, the highest level since
Oct. 24 though 2.3 percent lower than a year ago.  Northeast was little changed after rising yesterday to
24,892 megawatts, the most since Dec. 9, 2011. The region is
operating 35 megawatts shy of full capacity and 0.2 percent
higher than a year ago. Western U.S. nuclear generation was also
little changed at 19,897 megawatts, or 83 percent of capacity,
trailing the year-ago level by 9 percent.  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall when energy use is lowest, may increase
consumption of natural gas and coal to generate electricity. The
average refueling down time was 43 days in 2011, according to
the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
