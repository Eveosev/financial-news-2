The U.S.  Army Corps  of Engineers
rejected lawmakers’ request to increase the flow of water from a
major tributary to the Mississippi River, where declining water
levels are jeopardizing about $7 billion in cargo.  “The Corps lacks authority” to adjust flows from the
Missouri River to benefit navigation on the Mississippi, Jo-
Ellen Darcy, the Army’s assistant secretary for civil works,
said in a letter to Senator  Richard Durbin , an Illinois
Democrat, which was made public today.  Releasing water from reservoirs on the Missouri River would
put at risk water supplies in the upper Midwest, according to
the letter. Rain that is forecast and expedited removal of rock
formations are expected to keep the Mississippi River navigable,
according to the letter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
