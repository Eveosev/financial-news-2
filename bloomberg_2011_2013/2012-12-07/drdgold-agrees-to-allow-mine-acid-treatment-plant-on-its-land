DRDGold Ltd. (DRD)  agreed to allow  South
Africa ’s water infrastructure authority to access its land to
build a pipeline and plant for treating acid discharged from
derelict mines that’s contaminating Johannesburg groundwater.  The Trans-Caledon Tunnel Authority SOC Ltd., which builds
dams and tunnels to supply water to South African factories and
mines, will have access to DRDGold’s land and a shaft to build
the plant, the gold mining company said in a statement. The
state agency will also be allowed to build a pipeline on the
land and use one of the company’s sludge dams, it said.  “While these heads of agreement should not be seen as an
unqualified endorsement of the state’s acid mine drainage
solution, and do not affect our right to either challenge future
directives or to implement our own initiatives should it become
necessary, they are an encouraging development,” Chief
Executive Officer Niel Pretorius said in the statement.  The government wants mining companies to help pay to treat
acid water oozing from derelict  gold mines  around Johannesburg.
While the authority plans to treat the water, it hasn’t found a
way to pay for maintaining the plants, Zodwa Mbele, executive
manager for project finance and treasury, said on Oct. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
