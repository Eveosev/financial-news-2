OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, the biggest
sulphur-dioxide polluter, said the first stage of a facility to
reduce emissions will start in late 2016 as the company woos
investors after  Norway  banned it from the country’s wealth fund.  The company needs to cut emissions at its Polar unit to
425,000 metric tons from 1.91 million tons with the aid of the
sulphur recovery-and-storage plant, Konstantin Mashkovich, head
environmental regulation, told reporters in London today without
giving a timeline for full completion of the facility.  While Norilsk didn’t meet Norway’s sovereign wealth fund at
investor roadshows it held this week in Helsinki, Stockholm,
Amsterdam, Zurich and London, it is “open to conversations,”
said Sergey Belyakov, the deputy head of investor relations.  Norway  excluded  Norilsk from its sovereign wealth fund in
2009 because of environmental damage. Norilsk is responsible for
a quarter of  Russia ’s emissions of industrial sulphur dioxide.
The company released 2.05 million tons of the pollutant in 2011,
five times more than Xstrata Plc, the second-biggest emitter,
according data on 258 mining companies compiled by Bloomberg.  Norilsk, the world’s biggest nickel miner, is spending $2
billion to cut emissions on top of the more than $2.4 billion it
invested from 2007 through 2011, according to a presentation.  It signed a deal with  Italy ’s Techint Group to develop a
$1.8 billion sulphur dioxide-capture project at the Polar unit,
Norilsk said in July. It aims to cut emissions at its Zapolyarny
site to 1,400 tons a year from 40,000, the presentation showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
