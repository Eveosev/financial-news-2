Raised a Christian, Jim Holt grew up
thinking that God created the universe. After he stopped
believing in an all-powerful deity, Holt set out to find an
answer to the existential question, “Why is there something
rather than nothing?”  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  In talking to  Stanford University  physicist Andrei Linde,
Holt found that it’s not so difficult to cook up a universe like
ours. You don’t need supernatural powers or cosmic resources.
All you need is a hundred-thousandth of a gram of matter.  “All the matter in the universe gets created from the
negative energy of the gravitational field,” said Linde, who
came up with the theory of chaotic inflation to explain the
formation of galaxies.  So it’s possible someone in a civilization only slightly
more advanced than ours created our universe in a lab -- a
physicist hacker -- just for the hell of it.  I spoke with Jim Holt, author of “Why Does the World
Exist?” on the following topics:  1. Something From Nothing  2. Existential Quest  3. Infinite Minds  4. Brute Fact  5. Simplicity Vs. Fullness  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  (Lewis Lapham is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
