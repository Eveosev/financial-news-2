China ’s yuan dropped after the
central bank cut the fixing for a second day to a level that
meant the currency had to weaken to stay within its trading band.  The People’s Bank of China lowered the reference rate by
0.03 percent to 6.2930 against the greenback, following a 0.6
percent advance in the  Dollar Index (DXY)  yesterday. The fixing is
1.03 percent weaker than yesterday’s close, while the yuan is
allowed to trade a maximum of 1 percent on either side of it.  “The central bank is like a stabilizer now as it doesn’t
want a rapid appreciation or depreciation of the currency,”
said Hu Yifan, chief economist at Haitong International
Securities Co. in Hong Kong, who previously worked at the World
Bank. “There are still solid fundamentals for  yuan  appreciation
within three years, during which it could gain up to 2 percent
annually against the dollar.”  The yuan dropped 0.03 percent to close at 6.2301 per dollar
in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. That’s 1 percent more than today’s reference rate. The
currency was little changed for the week. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in exchange rates used
to price options, climbed 10 basis points, or 0.1 percentage
point, to 1.6 percent this week.  Consumer-price gains may have accelerated to about 2.2
percent from a year earlier in November, according to a front-
page commentary in the China Securities Journal written by Cao
Shuishui today. The statistics bureau will release inflation
data on Dec. 9.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan gained 0.02
percent today to 6.2095 per dollar, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. It strengthened 0.08 percent for the week. Twelve-
month non-deliverable forwards were little changed today and
advanced 0.1 percent this week to 6.3165. The contracts traded
at a 1.4 percent discount to the onshore spot rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
