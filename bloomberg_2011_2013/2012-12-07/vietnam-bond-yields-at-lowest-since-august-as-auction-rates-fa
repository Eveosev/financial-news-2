Vietnam ’s government bonds gained,
with the five-year yield sliding to the lowest level since
August, after borrowing costs fell at auctions. The dong was
little changed.  The State Treasury sold 2 trillion dong ($96 million) of
two-year notes at 9 percent and 2 trillion dong of three-year
securities at 9.25 percent yesterday, the Hanoi Stock Exchange
said in a statement on its website. The rates compare with 9.15
percent and 9.29 percent, respectively, for similar-maturity
debt at a Nov. 29 auction, and 9.35 percent and 9.55 percent for
the same maturities on Nov. 13.  “Traders have been speculating about a cut in the key
 interest rate  by the central bank and given the uncertainty of
the macro-economic outlook,  government bonds  are a relatively-
safe channel in which to invest,” said Hoang Thanh Tam, head of
the fixed-income department at Vietnam Maritime Commercial
Joint-Stock Bank in Hanoi.  The benchmark  five-year  yield fell three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 9.77 percent, the lowest level since
Aug. 27, according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. The yield dropped seven basis points this week.  The dong traded at 20,843 per dollar as of 4:30 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,847 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank set its reference rate
at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website.
The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either
side of the fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
