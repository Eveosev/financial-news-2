European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said European Union countries seeking to adopt the euro
should take note of the difficulties some of its current members
are encountering.  “The recent experiences of some current euro-area members
also serve as a cautionary tale to EU members bound by the
Treaty to adopt the euro in the future,” Draghi said in a
speech in Budapest today.  The economy of the 17-nation bloc fell into recession in
the third quarter after a debt crisis that started in  Greece 
three years ago roiled financial markets, pushed five members
into seeking bailouts and forcing the ECB into unchartered
territory. European leaders are also working on strategies to
strengthen institutional foundations to safeguard the euro.  The crisis has “provided us with a major institutional
lesson: maximizing the benefits of the single currency requires
not only a strong ECB; it also requires additional strong common
institutions,” Draghi said.  While “much work remains to be done” in individual
countries inside and outside the currency bloc and across
 Europe , “I have no doubt that this opportunity to continue
progress will be seized and that together we will reap the
benefits of sustainable economic convergence and lasting
regional integration,” Draghi said, adding that progress in
addressing the shortcomings is being made.  To contact the reporters on this story:
