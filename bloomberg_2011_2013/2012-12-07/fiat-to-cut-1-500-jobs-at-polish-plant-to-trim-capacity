Fiat SpA (F) , which expects to lose 700
million euros ($903 million) in Europe this year, will eliminate
1,500 jobs at its Polish operations to reduce production.  The cuts will come at a plant in Tychy as well as from
sales staff in the country, the Turin, Italy-based carmaker said
in a statement today.  Fiat will build fewer than 350,000 cars in 2012 in Poland,
and less than 300,000 in the country next year, the company
said. The European auto market is on track to hit a 17-year low
in 2012. Fiat assembled 600,000 cars at the factory in 2009.  Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne , who has been
seeking a solution to European overcapacity, predicts demand in
the region won’t recover until 2014 at the earliest. About 26
percent of European auto production capacity is surplus to the
current demand, according to research firm IHS Automotive.  The Tychy plant has 5,800 workers and currently makes the
Lancia Ypsilon, the Fiat 500, the old version of the Panda and
 Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s Ka city car. The factory is due to stop
manufacturing the Panda in the coming months, Fiat said. Ford
output won’t be affected and will be in line with market demand,
a spokesman said in an e-mail.  Political Headwinds  Marchionne, who is also the Chrysler Group LLC CEO, said in
October that “everything is on the table” to raise capital to
buy the Chrysler stake Fiat doesn’t already own.  “It’s simply easier to fire people in  Poland  at the moment
than in  Italy , where there are strong political headwinds,”
said Frankfurt-based Commerzbank analyst Sascha Gommel, who has
a hold rating on Fiat stock. “They need to do more to increase
their financial leverage so that they can buy the rest of
Chrysler.”  Fiat, which last year moved production of the new Panda
from Poland to Italy, doesn’t plan to further reduce jobs in
Italy after shutting a plant in Sicily in 2011. The Italian
carmaker says it will reach the break-even point in Europe in
2015 at the soonest as it begins selling more expensive models
built at plants in Italy.  PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) ,  Renault SA (RNO)  and Fiat, which don’t
export from  Europe  to the same extent as their German rivals,
are faced with a local market that’s about 20 percent below the
2007 peak.  Government Help  The French government on Oct. 24 committed $9 billion in
state credit guarantees to Peugeot’s finance unit to help prop
up Europe’s second-largest automaker. In return, the government
said it wants an “employment solution” for each of Peugeot’s
workers, which may conflict with the company’s plans to close a
plant in Aulnay, near Paris, and eliminate 8,000 jobs.  Ford has announced the furthest-reaching restructuring
measures in the region, with plans to shutter two sites in the
U.K. and one in Belgium to shed 5,700 jobs and 18 percent of its
European capacity.  General Motors Co. (GM)  plans to close its Bochum, Germany
factory in 2016, and is cutting 2,600 jobs in the region by the
end of the year. The Detroit-based carmaker, which anticipates a
deficit of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion in Europe this year,
aims to break even there by 2015.  To contact the reporters on this story:
