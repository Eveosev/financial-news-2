Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (6883) , a
casino venture between billionaire James Packer and a son of
gambling tycoon Stanley Ho, will buy a Philippines-listed
company as a vehicle for its operations there.  Melco Crown, which now has most of its assets in the
Chinese city of Macau, will pay 1.26 billion pesos ($30.8
million) for a 93.1 percent stake in  Manchester International
Holdings Unlimited Corp. (MIH) , according to a Hong Kong Stock
Exchange filing yesterday.  Melco Crown, based in Hong Kong, said it will sell
Manchester’s operating units back to the existing shareholders,
and will use the target company to manage and operate its
Philippine operations, including the previously announced
casino, hotel, retail and entertainment project.  The American depositary receipts of Melco Crown gained 3.7
percent to $15.35 at 10:42 a.m. in New York on Dec. 7, after
rising as much as 4.1 percent following the announcement. Each
ADR represents three underlying common shares.  The company plans to invest $600 million prior to opening
in the Philippine project, which it will build in a joint
venture with local companies  SM Investments Corp. (SM) ,  Belle Corp. (BEL) 
and PremiumLeisure & Amusement Inc., according to an Oct. 25
filing to Hong Kong’s stock exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
