The  Dominican Republic  will cut its
greenhouse-gas emissions by 25 percent from 2010 levels by 2030,
the first time a developing country has committed to an absolute
reduction.  “This commitment is unique in that it comes from a
developing country, combines a legal mandate with an absolute
emission reduction, and is unconditional and is not dependent on
external funding,” Jose Alberto Garibaldi, a member of the
Dominican Republic delegation, said today by e-mail. “You would
be hard-pressed to find another one combining these anywhere.”  The Caribbean nation passed a  law  in January that commits
it to reduce discharges of climate-warming gases from 3.4 metric
tons of carbon dioxide per capita to 2.8 tons per capita in
2030. The Dominican Republic has a population of 10 million,
according to the CIA World Factbook.  Nations are meeting in Doha to negotiate a climate treaty
to succeed the  Kyoto Protocol , which sets caps on emissions from
developed countries for the five years through 2012 and may be
extended through 2020. At talks in Durban,  South Africa  last
year, countries agreed to plot a post-2020 climate deal that
would also bind  developing countries  like  China  and Qatar.  Nations including China, Brazil and South Africa announced
in  Copenhagen  in 2009 voluntary commitments to slow the rate of
growth in discharges, or reduce the average amount of carbon
dioxide generated per unit of GDP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
