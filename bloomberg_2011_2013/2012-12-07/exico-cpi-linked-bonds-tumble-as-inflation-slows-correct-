Mexican bonds linked to consumer
price increases fell, pushing yields to a six-month high, as
inflation in  Latin America ’s second-biggest economy slowed more
than forecast. The peso climbed on U.S. payroll gains.  The yield on Udibonos debt due in 2014 increased 18 basis
points, or 0.18 percentage point, to 1.18 percent at 4 p.m. in
Mexico City, the highest closing level since May 24, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was the biggest one-day climb
in yields since March 17, 2011. Yields on fixed-rate peso bonds
maturing in the same year fell one basis point to 4.79 percent.  Mexico’s annual inflation slowed to 4.18 percent in
November from 4.60 percent a month earlier, decelerating further
after peaking at 4.77 percent in September. Economists forecast
a 4.35 percent pace, according to the median of 13 estimates in
a Bloomberg survey.  “The supply shock is over,”  Edwin Gutierrez , who helps
manage about $10 billion of emerging-market debt including
Mexican local-currency bonds at  Aberdeen Asset Management Plc (ADN)  in
 London , said in a telephone interview. Today’s sell-off in
Udibonos shows that “the market is not looking for inflation
protection at this point.”  Mexico’s peso climbed after payrolls rose more than
forecast in the U.S., the biggest market for the nation’s
exports. The currency advanced 0.2 percent to 12.8505 per dollar
today, pushing its advance this week to 0.9 percent. The peso
has rallied 8.4 percent this year, the most among the dollar’s
16 most-traded counterparts.  U.S. employers added 146,000 jobs in November, Labor
Department figures showed today in  Washington . The median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for an increase
of 85,000.  Mexico  sends about 80 percent of its exports to its
northern neighbor.  To contact the reporters on this story:
