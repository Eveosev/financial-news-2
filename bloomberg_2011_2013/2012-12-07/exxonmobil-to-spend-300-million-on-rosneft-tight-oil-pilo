Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  plans to spend as
much as $300 million on a pilot project with OAO Rosneft to tap
tight oil resources in  Russia .  State-run Rosneft will own 51 percent and Exxon will hold
49 percent of the venture that will explore the Achimov and
Bazhenov formations in western Siberia next year, according to a
 statement  today. The work will focus on 23 license blocks.  Exxon formed a partnership with Rosneft last year in which
the Irving, Texas-based company also gained access to offshore
deposits in Russia’s frontier Arctic and Black Sea region.
Russia, which vies with  Saudi Arabia  as the world’s largest oil
producer, may overhaul its tax system to support tight oil
production, according to Rosneft.  The partnership will select blocks for commercial
development in 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
