The yen climbed against most major
peers after a magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck Japan, mirroring
movements in the currency after a record temblor in 2011.  Japan’s currency surged to a record level in the days
following the March 11, 2011, quake and the tsunami that led to
meltdowns at a nuclear plant in Fukushima. A tsunami alert was
issued for northeast Japan for the quake that shook buildings in
Tokyo today.  “The yen is being bought in a knee-jerk reaction to
headlines on the earthquake,” said  Marito Ueda , senior managing
director in Tokyo at  FX Prime Corp. (8711)  “Given the difference in
the magnitude of this earthquake to last year’s, the impact on
the currency has been quite limited. If we confirm bigger damage
from the tsunami, we may see further buying of the yen.”  The yen rose 0.1 percent to 82.32 per dollar as of 5:43
p.m. in Tokyo. It climbed 0.4 percent to 106.48 against the
euro. Japan’s currency was higher against 14 of its 16 most-
traded peers.  The  Bank of Japan (8301)  led a coordinated intervention with Group
of Seven nations on March 18, 2011, to counter a jump in the yen
after a magnitude 9 quake struck  Japan  a week earlier. The
disaster had stoked speculation companies would repatriate
overseas assets to pay for rebuilding.  The currency reached a postwar record 75.35 per dollar on
Oct. 31 last year. Japan hasn’t intervened to influence the
direction of its currency since Nov. 4, 2011, the last in a
series of sales that year that totaled 14.3 trillion yen ($173.6
billion), the third-largest annual sum in data going back to
1991.  Currency strength has exacerbated Japan’s economic decline
as it hurts the overseas competitiveness of the nation’s
exporters. Japan’s gross domestic product fell an annualized 3.5
percent in the three months through September, after a revised
0.3 percent gain the previous quarter, the Cabinet Office said
in  Tokyo  last month  To contact the reporters on this story:
