Berkeley Group Holdings Plc (BKG) , the
U.K.’s second-largest homebuilder by market value, climbed to
the highest since 2007 in London trading after reporting a 45
profit increase for the fiscal first half.  The shares rose as much as 7.1 percent to 1,767 pence after
Berkeley said net income climbed to 107.5 million pounds in the
six months through October from 74 million pounds a year
earlier. The company will pay a dividend for the period of 15
pence a share, the first in five years, according to a statement
today.  The U.K.’s fragile recovery from a double-dip recession has
hampered the  property market  and restricted mortgage lending,
prompting the  Bank of England  to bolster the market with its
Funding for Lending Scheme.  Mortgage approvals  rose to a nine-
month high in October and a better-than-expected labor market is
helping to stabilize the housing market.  “The group has seen a strong trading performance across
the board, with increases in average selling prices, volumes and
net margins,” Rachael Applegate, an analyst at Panmure Gordon &
Co., said in a note to investors today. The broker increased its
12-month target price for the shares to 1,650 pence from 1,390
pence and kept its hold rating.  Berkeley was up 80 pence, or 4.9 percent, to 1,730 pence as
of 9:10 a.m., giving the company a market value of 2.3 billion
pounds. The shares have risen 35 percent this year compared with
a 64 percent gain for the seven members of the Bloomberg EMEA
Homebuilders Index.  Higher Prices  Berkeley sold 1,927 homes in the first half compared with
1,506 a year earlier. The average price climbed to 335,000
pounds from 254,000 pounds as the company focused more on
projects in central  London .  “The London market has been underpinned by international
buyers and U.K. buyers who are equity rich,” Managing Director
Rob Perrins said in an interview.  The company invested 202 million pounds in land in the
first half, acquiring around 1,965 plots on five sites,
including the former headquarters of News Corp.’s News
International unit for 150 million pounds, according to the
statement.  Berkeley’s gross profit margin widened to 29.3 percent from
28.8 percent, while its operating margin rose to 19.6 percent as
the company reduced its costs.  “We’ve been able to build more homes with the same number
of people, so our overheads have come down,” Perrins said by
phone. “That’s what has maintained the margin.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
