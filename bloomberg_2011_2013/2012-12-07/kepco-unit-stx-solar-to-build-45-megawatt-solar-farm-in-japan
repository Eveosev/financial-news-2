South Korean companies, including
 Korea  South-East Power Co., a unit of Koreaâ€™s monopoly power
distributor, and STX Solar Co., plan to build a 45-megawatt
solar farm in Sendai,  Japan .  The project may cost 130 billion won ($120 million) when
construction begins in the first half of next year in
northeastern Japan, which was hit by a tsunami and earthquake in
March 2011, Gumi, South Korea-based  STX  said in an e-mailed
statement.  The solar farm will be able to generate power to meet the
energy needs of some 19,000 households, the statement said.  Chief executives at the four Korean companies, including
Bookuk Securities Co., signed a preliminary contract in  Seoul 
with their counterpart in Sendai today, it said.  Sendai Aoba will be in charge of securing land and
administrative approvals. The Korean companies plan to sell
output from the solar farm to  Tohoku Electric Power Co. Inc. (9506) ,
