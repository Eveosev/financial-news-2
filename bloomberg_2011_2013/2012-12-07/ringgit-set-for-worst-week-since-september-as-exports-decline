Malaysia’s ringgit was set for its
biggest weekly drop since September as exports fell and U.S.
policy makers struggled to agree on budget revisions needed to
avert more than $600 billion of spending cuts and tax increases.  The currency weakened for a fifth day, the longest losing
streak since August, as data today showed overseas sales 
declined 3.2 percent in October from a year earlier, compared
with the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey for a 3 percent
drop and a 2.6 percent rise in September. President  Barack Obama 
warned yesterday that the world’s largest economy will suffer
unless there’s an agreement to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff.  “As we head into year-end, the discussions on the fiscal
cliff become more intense, so that would probably prompt some
flight to safety,” said  Enrico Tanuwidjaja , an economist at
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in  Singapore . “Inevitably, the
external headwinds will hit Asian growth.”  The ringgit dropped 0.4 percent this week, the most since
the five days ended Sept. 21, to 3.0511 per dollar as of 12:16
p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency retreated 0.2 percent today. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in exchange rates used
to price options, fell 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point,
to 4.20 percent.  Government bonds declined. The yield on the 3.314 percent
notes due October 2017 rose three basis points today and this
week to 3.29 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
