Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4) ,
the Brazilian airline cutting flights and jobs to end losses, is
seeking to renegotiate terms of 1.1 billion reais in debentures
held by  Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4)  and  Banco do Brasil SA .  The terms on the 2015 debentures must be reworked by the
end of the year or the carrier will be out of compliance with
covenants and have to pay the debt immediately, Chief Financial
Officer Edmar Prado Lopes Neto said. A weaker real and rising
fuel costs are hurting results, he said.  Gol is working to return to profit after  adjusted losses  in
five of the past six quarters as  Brazil ’s economic growth and
domestic travel demand slow. The country’s second-biggest
airline is firing workers, scaling back its schedule and
returning aging jets.  “Operations are weak despite cost reductions,” Lopes Neto
said yesterday in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo, where
Gol is based. “We will continue to be pressured for some
time.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
