Polish electricity  for Saturday rose
from a week earlier as unplanned outages coincided with
increased flows to Sweden.  Next-day power added 2.6 percent to 190.4 zloty ($57.73) a
megawatt-hour, exchange data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Poland’s grid operator forecasts 1,319 megawatts of
unplanned power halts this weekend, including  PGE SA (PGE) ’s 858-
megawatt Belchatow unit and its 235-megawatt Turow units. Energa
SA was to stop operating its 226-megawatt Ostroleka unit today
for three days, PSE Operator SA said yesterday.  Poland was set to export more electricity to Sweden during
peak-hours, data from the  Polish grid manager showed.    Day-ahead electricity on the coupled markets of the  Czech
Republic , Slovakia and Hungary decreased 11 percent to 47.99
euros ($62.14) a megawatt-hour in a daily auction, according to
the countries’ market operators.  The Czech year-ahead contract declined for the seventh day,
dropping by 0.2 percent to 45.45 euros a megawatt-hour, broker
data on Bloomberg showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
