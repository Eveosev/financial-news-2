Carbon emissions  in the U.S.
Northeast were auctioned for $1.93, the minimum allowable bid,
as the nine states participating in the  Regional Greenhouse Gas
Initiative  purchased about half as many permits as were offered.  The quarterly auction, held Dec. 5, raised $38.1 million by
selling 19.8 million of 37.6 million allowances, the fewest
since  September 2011 , according to a  statement  today on RGGI’s
website. Each permit gives a company the right to emit one ton
of carbon dioxide in a cap-and-trade program that includes the
six New England states, New York,  Delaware  and Maryland.  States use the proceeds for renewable-energy programs,
utility programs, assisting consumers with bills or to pad their
general funds. Last year, New Jersey’s Republican Governor  Chris Christie  announced his state will exit the program and called it
a failure because the CO2 permits never sold near their
projected costs of $20 to $30.  RGGI investments made during 2009 to 2011 will help avoid
emissions from the equivalent of 2 million passenger vehicles
for a year, Collin O’Mara, a RGGI Inc. board member and
secretary of the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and
Environmental Control, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
