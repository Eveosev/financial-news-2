Kazkommertsbank,  Kazakhstan ’s largest
lender by assets, said net income rose 9.4 percent in the first
nine months from a year earlier, helped by a one-time dividend
payout by national telephone monopoly Kazakhtelecom.  Profit grew to 19.6 billion tenge ($130.5 million) from
17.9 billion in the same period last year, the Almaty-based bank
said in a Regulatory News Service statement today.  The lender said it benefited from a “significant
increase” in dividends received from its Kazakhtelecom shares,
collecting 8.5 billion tenge in the period, up from 181 million
tenge a year earlier, according to the statement.  Concerns about Kazkommertsbank’s falling profitability
prompted a  downgrade  in September of its debt and deposit
rankings by Moody’s Investors Service, which reduced the
lender’s foreign-currency senior unsecured debt rating two steps
to Caa1, seven levels below investment grade.  Kazkommertsbank (KKB) 
questioned the assessment at the time, denying any worsening of
profitability during the past year.  Kazkommertsbank estimates lending will grow 2 percent to 3
percent this year, according to a  presentation  published on its
website today. The bank predicts profit will increase 10 percent
this year, reiterating its previous earnings guidance, according
to the presentation.  The lender also said Kazakhstan will start implementing
Basel III capital adequacy rules in the middle of next year,
with a full transition to take place in 2019, according to the
presentation. Existing regulatory requirements will be abolished
from 2013, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
