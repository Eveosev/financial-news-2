Airbus SAS must deliver a record
number of aircraft this month to meet its 2012 target as the
company risks losing its spot as the No. 1 aircraft maker to
 Boeing Co. (BA)  for the first time since 2003.  Airbus shipped 54 aircraft last month and has handed over
516 airliners through November, the Toulouse, France-based unit
of European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. said today on its
website. Boeing said yesterday it delivered 537 aircraft in the
period.  Airbus plans to deliver about 580 airliners this year, a
company record. That will require the manufacturer to top a
three-year-old mark of 61 aircraft in a single month. It still
has to ship five A380s to meet its target for 30 this year.  A deal with an undisclosed customer for 100 narrow-body
A320 airliners helped Airbus secure a year-high 186 order
bookings in November, pushing it to a positive book-to-bill
ratio for the year and taking the company past the 12,000 total
order mark. Airbus had been in talks with Chinese airlines and
Air Asia Co. for additional A320 sales.  Deals booked last month, including a contract with China
Aircraft Leasing Co. for 36 narrow-bodies, brings the full-year
intake to 646 gross orders, four shy of its 2012 forecast.
Cancellations rose to 61 aircraft.  Chicago-based Boeing booked 1,156 orders through Dec. 4 and
suffered 104 cancellations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
