Oil advanced, trimming a weekly
decline, as the jobless rate dropped to its lowest level in four
years in the U.S., the world’s largest consumer of crude.  West Texas Intermediate futures increased as much as 0.8
percent, reversing an earlier loss of 0.5 percent. Employment
climbed by 146,000 in November and the  unemployment rate  fell to
7.7 percent, the lowest since December 2008, Labor Department
figures showed today in  Washington . Crude fell earlier after
Germany’s Bundesbank cut its 2013 growth projection for  Europe ’s
largest economy.  “Overall it is good for the economy,” Ole Hansen, senior
manager of trading advisory at Saxo Bank A/S in Copenhagen, said
after the U.S. jobs data. “It should remove some uncertainty
we’ve had the past several days, although upside is likely to be
limited” because of the weak European economy, he said.  Crude for January delivery rose as much as 66 cents to
$86.92 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and traded for $86.53 at 1:45 p.m. London time. The
contract slid $1.62 yesterday to $86.26, the lowest close since
Nov. 15. Prices are down 2.7 percent this week and 12 percent
this year.  Brent for January settlement advanced 56 cents to $107.59 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
European benchmark contract was at a  premium  of $21.04 to WTI.
It closed at $20.77 yesterday, the narrowest gap since Oct. 19.  -- Editors: Rachel Graham,  John Buckley   To contact the reporter on this story:
