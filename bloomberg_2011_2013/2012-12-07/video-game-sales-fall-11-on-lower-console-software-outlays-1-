U.S. consumers spent 11 percent less
on video games, consoles and accessories in November than a year
earlier, led by fewer purchases of consoles and handheld
players.  Retail spending on the products totaled $2.55 billion last
month, down from $2.87 billion a year earlier, industry
researcher  NPD Group Inc.  said today in an e-mailed statement.  Manufacturers of game consoles are beginning a round of
product introductions to replace players that have been around
for six years or more. Nintendo Co. said on Nov. 26 that it sold
more than 1.2 million game players in the U.S. since Nov. 18,
including 400,000 of its new Wii U with a touch-screen GamePad.  Hardware sales in November fell 13 percent to $838.9
million from a year earlier, while software purchases declined
11 percent to $1.43 billion, NPD said. Spending on accessories
shrank 8 percent to $280.9 million.  Separately,  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  said U.S. retailers sold 1.26
million Xbox video-game consoles last month to lead the
industry, citing NPD. Stores sold 750,000 of the players over
the Black Friday weekend, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft
said today in an e-mail.  Nintendo, based in Kyoto,  Japan , said U.S. stores sold
about 1.75 million of its hardware products in November,
including almost 910,000 portable game players and more than
845,000 home consoles, citing NPD. The sales include more than
425,000 new Wii U players over seven days during the month from
the Nov. 18 introduction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
