OMV CEO Gerhard Roiss says at Vienna
press briefing that possible RWE exit won’t effect viability of
pipeline project.
* “It is not an issue of control, it’s an issue of investment.
The shareholders of Nabucco at the end will be the ones who have
the gas:” Roiss
* “Nabucco has to be commercially viable. We’re not going to
force any prestige projects. We’re too small for that:” Roiss
* “The value of Nabucco is in the intergovernmental agreements.
We’re still working under the assumption that the
intergovernmental agreement holds for Nabucco west:” Roiss
* OMV will consider building its own pipeline depending upon
results of Black Sea natural gas discoveries. “You cannot
develop a field without transport:” Roiss  To contact the reporter on this story:
