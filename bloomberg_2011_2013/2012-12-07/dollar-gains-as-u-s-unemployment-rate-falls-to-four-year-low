The dollar strengthened against the
euro as U.S. employers added more jobs than forecast last month
and the unemployment rate dropped to an almost four-year low.  The 17-nation currency fell against most major counterparts
after a report that the majority of European Central Bank
members indicated support for an interest-rate cut if the
economy doesn’t pick up and  Germany ’s economic outlook was
downgraded.  Canada ’s currency rallied to its strongest in a
month as the nation’s employers added almost six times as many
jobs as forecast.  “The market was thinking that the hurricane would have a
much bigger impact on the U.S. numbers than it did, which was a
big surprise,” said  Fabian Eliasson , head of U.S. currency
sales at  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411)  in New York. “In the
short-term, it means a more of a risk-on scenario. The whole
fiscal cliff issue is so overbearing on us, nothing else trades
like that right now.”  The dollar rose 0.3 percent to $1.2927 per euro at 5 p.m.
in New York, reaching $1.2877 the highest since Nov. 23. It was
0.1 percent stronger at 82.49 per yen after gaining as much as
0.5 percent. The euro fell 0.2 percent to 106.67 yen.  Futures Positions  Futures traders cut bets that the euro will decline against
the dollar to the least since September 2011, figures from the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission show. Net shorts were
32,795 on Dec. 4, compared with net shorts of 66,693 a week
earlier.  Net-bets on short yen positions against the dollar reached
90,326, the most since July 2007, the data show.  The dollar pared earlier losses against growth-related
currencies such as  Mexico ’s peso and Canada’s dollar after U.S.
 consumer confidence  fell to a one-year low as Americans grow
concerned about the possibility of higher taxes due to the so-
called fiscal cliff.  U.S. House Speaker John Boehner said “there’s no progress
to report” on talks with President  Barack Obama  to avert tax
increases and spending cuts set to take effect in January.  Mexico’s peso was the third-best performer against the
dollar, after Canada and South Africa, as the unemployment rate
fell to 7.7 percent in the U.S.  The peso rose 0.2 percent to 12.8505 per U.S. dollar. The
currency has strengthened 8.4 percent this year through
yesterday, the best performance among 16 major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  Canada Levels  The Canadian dollar rose 0.3 percent to 98.84 cents per
U.S. dollar after declining as much as 0.2 percent. It touched
the strongest level since Nov. 7.  “If we can close lower on the day here and extend below
98.90, the downside opens up quite a bit more,”  Shaun Osborne ,
chief currency strategist at  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , said in a
telephone interview. “We’re still probably going to touch 97 or
98 over the course of the next few weeks.”  Canadian employment  increased 59,300 and lowered the
unemployment rate to 7.2 percent from 7.4 percent, the first
decline in five months, Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa.  The Canadian currency was also buoyed as Canada’s
government approved  China ’s  Cnooc Ltd (883) ’s $15.1 billion takeover
of  Nexen Inc. (NXY)  and Petroliam Nasional Bhd.’s C$5.2 billion ($5.2
billion) takeover of  Progress Energy Resources Corp. (PRQ)   The euro has lost 2.5 percent this year, the second-worst
performer among the 10 developed-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The yen slid 9.5 percent
and the dollar fell 2.2 percent.  Benchmark Rates  A majority of ECB policy makers were open to cutting the
benchmark rate yesterday and there is a possibility of a
reduction early next year, three officials with knowledge of the
Governing Council’s deliberations said.  The central bank held its  benchmark  at a record low of 0.75
percent yesterday and kept the deposit rate at zero.  The Frankfurt-based Bundesbank cut its growth projection
for 2013 to 0.4 percent from the 1.6 percent predicted in June
and said the economy.  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against currencies of six U.S. trading
partners, rose 0.2 percent to 80.412, touching the strongest
since Nov. 23.  U.S. employment climbed by 146,000 following a revised
138,000 gain in October that was less than initially estimated,
Labor Department figures showed today in  Washington . The median
estimate of 91 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a
gain of 85,000. The jobless rate fell to 7.7 percent from 7.9
percent.  The Fed is working to boost the economy and reduce
unemployment by continuing purchases of housing debt that have
helped drive borrowing costs to an all-time low. The policy-
setting Federal Open Market Committee’s last meeting of this
year is scheduled for Dec. 11-12 in Washington.  “The Fed is still looking for a sustained improvement in
the labor markets and it will take at least six months to see
that,” said  Vassili Serebriakov , a currency strategist at BNP
Paribas SA in New York. “We still expect the dollar to weaken
over time.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
