India ’s 10-year government bonds
gained, pushing the yield to a five-week low, after the central
bank said it will buy more debt next week.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will buy as much as 120 billion
rupees ($2.2 billion) of notes due in 2017, 2020, 2022 and 2026
on Dec. 11, according to a statement on its website. The
monetary authority bought 116.43 billion rupees of securities on
Dec. 4, the first purchase since June.  “The bond purchase news has lifted investor sentiment as
this will help ease the cash squeeze in the banking system,”
said Debendra Kumar Dash, a fixed-income trader at  Development
Credit Bank Ltd. (DEVB)  in Mumbai. “Since there is no debt sale
scheduled next week, bonds will remain largely supported.”  The yield on the 8.33 percent notes maturing in July 2026,
the most-traded government security, fell two basis points today
to 8.24 percent as of 9:56 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the
central bank’s trading system. That was the lowest level since
Oct. 29. The rate fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, this week.  The central bank has bought 936.43 billion rupees of
securities so far in the fiscal year that began April 1.  Lenders borrowed an  average  of 928 billion rupees a day
from the RBI’s repurchase window in November, compared with 671
billion rupees the previous month, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. They borrowed 732 billion rupees yesterday.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell two basis
points to 7.69 percent, the lowest level since Oct. 29, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The rate declined five basis points
this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
