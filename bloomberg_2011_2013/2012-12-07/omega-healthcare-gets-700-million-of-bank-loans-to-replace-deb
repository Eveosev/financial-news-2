Omega Healthcare Investors Inc. (OHI) , a
real-estate investment trust targeting the long-term care
industry, got $700 million of bank loans to replace debt
obtained last year.  The financing consists of a $500 million revolving credit
line that will be used to fund acquisitions, and a $200 million
unsecured term loan, Omega said yesterday in a statement
distributed by Business Wire. The credit pact has a so-called
according feature allowing the company to expand its borrowing
by $300 million to a total of $1 billion.  Bank of America Corp.,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  and RBS Citizens
NA were lead arrangers for the financing, the  Hunt Valley ,
Maryland-based company said.  The four-year revolver pays interest at 1 percentage point
to 1.9 percentage points more than the London interbank offered
rate, depending on the company’s credit rating, according to the
statement.  The interest rate on the five-year term loan is 1.1
percentage points to 2.3 percentage points more than Libor,
which is a rate banks say they can borrow in dollars from each
other.  Omega has speculative-grade credit  ratings  of Ba2 at
Moody’s Investors Service and BB+ at Standard & Poor’s.  As of the end of September, Omega owned or held mortgages
on specialty hospitals, including skilled nursing and assisted
living facilities, in 33 states.  Under a revolver, money can be borrowed again once it’s
repaid; in a  term loan , it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
