Comtech Telecommunications Corp. (CMTL) , an
electronics communications company, fell the most in two years
after lowering its profit forecast in response to the threat of
 federal budget  cuts and tax increases.  Shares of the Melville, New York-based company declined as
much as 13.5 percent for the biggest intraday drop since Dec. 9,
2010. They traded at $23.74, down 8 percent, at 11:04 a.m. in
New York. The  stock  has dropped 17 percent this year.  Comtech yesterday forecast profit for fiscal 2013 at $1.26
to $1.34 a share, down from $1.40 to $1.48. The company also
forecast profit in its second quarter ending Jan. 31 at 10 to 12
cents a share. Analysts had predicted 34 cents a share, the
average of five estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Fred Kornberg blamed the company’s
lower guidance on the federal government’s so-called fiscal
cliff of tax increases and automatic spending cuts set to take
effect in the beginning of next year.  “Although our long-term growth plans have not changed, we
believe that the U.S. government’s failure to resolve the
‘fiscal cliff’ has resulted in increased uncertainty throughout
our customer base,” he said in a statement. “As such, we have
adjusted our fiscal 2013 business outlook and updated our
guidance accordingly.”  The company gets about half its revenue from the U.S.
government, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission
filing. It provides satellite communications gear and other
technology products to the Defense Department.  Comtech said yesterday that its first-quarter profit was
$9.5 million, or 45 cents a share, compared with $12.6 million,
or 47 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Analysts had
predicted earnings of 29 cents a share, the average of five
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “Stock likely to face pressure today,” Joseph Nadol, an
analyst at JPMorgan in New York, wrote in a note to clients.
“Q1 was fine, but the tough outlook will likely be the primary
driver of the stock today.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
