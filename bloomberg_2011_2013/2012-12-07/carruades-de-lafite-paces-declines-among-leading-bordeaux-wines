Carruades de Lafite, the second wine
of Bordeaux first growth Chateau Lafite-Rothschild, led declines
in the Liv-ex Bordeaux 500 Wine Index over the past year,
accounting for three of the five biggest drops.  Carruades vintages from 2002, 2004 and 2007 all fell more
than 40 percent over the period, while  Chateau dâ€™Yquem  1999
dessert wine and Pavillon Rouge 2002, the second wine of Chateau
Margaux, were also among the five leading decliners, according
to Liv-ex data on its  Cellar Watch  website.  Almost three-quarters of the index either fell or traded
unchanged over the past 12 months as speculative buying,
particularly from  China , diminished and investor attention
switched increasingly to Burgundy. The Liv-ex Bordeaux 500 Index
fell 7.9 percent in the year ended Nov. 30 and rallied 0.2
percent last month, while the Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index of first
growths fell 16 percent over the latest 12-month period.  Wines among the index components that are down more than 45
percent in the past year as of today include Carruades de Lafite
2002 and 2004 and Yquem 1999. Prices are according to market
data gathered by Liv-ex.
