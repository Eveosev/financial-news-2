Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, the 180-
year-old Philadelphia-based brokerage, hired two investment
bankers and three research analysts from bankrupt ThinkEquity
LLC to start health-care coverage.  Janney added Josh Muntner and Richard Page to lead health-
care investment banking in New York, Janney said today in an e-
mailed statement. Spencer Nam will lead medical device and
diagnostics research, Jim Molloy will cover specialty
pharmaceuticals and Kimberly Lee will handle biotechnology,
Janney said.  ThinkEquity, which employed about 100 people, filed to
liquidate in bankruptcy last month, about three weeks after the
San Francisco-based investment bank closed its stock-trading
business. Janney said in July it hired Greg Roth from
ThinkEquity as a managing director for its technology and media
investment-banking group.  “While recognizing that our industry continues to operate
under challenging conditions, Janney is committed to
capitalizing on strategic opportunities for growth, and the
health-care sector is one where we believe we can compete and
win,” Jordie  Maine , Janney’s head of capital markets, said in
the statement.  Small brokerages are finding it harder to earn commissions
as money managers trade fewer securities, execute more
transactions electronically and cut the amount of
recommendations they pay for. Avian Securities LLC, the equity
research firm that specializes in technology stocks, is closing
after 15 years in business, its founder said last week.  Nam and Molloy will be based in  Boston , and Lee will work
from San Francisco, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
