Berkeley Group Holdings Plc (BKG) , the
U.K.’s second-largest homebuilder by market value, said first-
half profit rose 45 percent as the company sold more homes with
wider margins.  Net income climbed to 107.5 million pounds ($173 million),
or 73.9 pence a share, in the six months through October from 74
million pounds, or 53.7 pence, a year earlier, the Cobham,
England-based company said in a statement today. Revenue rose 69
percent to 686 million pounds.  “These results, delivered in an uncertain market,
demonstrate the value created by acquiring land at the right
point in the economic cycle,” said Chairman Tony Pidgley in the
statement.  The U.K.’s fragile recovery from a double-dip recession has
hampered the  property market  and restricted mortgage lending,
prompting the  Bank of England  to bolster the market with its
Funding for Lending Scheme.  Mortgage approvals  rose to a nine-
month high in October and a better-than-expected labor market is
helping to stabilize the housing market.  Berkeley sold 1,927 homes in the first half compared with
1,506 a year earlier at an average price of 335,000 pounds. That
compares with an average selling price of 254,000 pounds in the
first six months of the previous fiscal year. Berkeley’s gross
margin widened to 29.3 percent from 28.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
