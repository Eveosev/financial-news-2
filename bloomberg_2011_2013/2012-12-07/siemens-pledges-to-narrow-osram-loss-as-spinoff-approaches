Siemens AG (SIE)  pledged to narrow the loss
at Osram unit as a spin off of the lighting business approaches.  Costs from an overhaul, including plant sales and job cuts,
will erase earnings at Osram, which posted a 121 million-euro
($156 million) loss in the year through September, the Munich-
based company said today in a report ahead of the spin off. In
total, parent Siemens will incur about 200 million euros in
costs related to the spin off process and making Osram a stand-
alone business.  Osram will incur about 500 million euros in costs over the
next two years as it adapts operations to make LED technology,
rather than incandescent  light bulbs  that are being phased out.
Earlier this year, it canceled a plan for an initial public
offering of Osram.  The lightbulb maker is seeking to reap 1 billion euros in
cost savings by 2015 while cutting at least 7,300 positions.
Rival  Royal Philips (PHIA)  Electronics NV is also in the midst of a
group overhaul that will result in the loss of about 6,700 jobs,
with lighting accounting for a share of that.  Siemens presented financial details for Osram for the first
time today. Shareholders will have to approve the plans at the
companyâ€™s annual meeting Jan. 23, and will receive one Osram
share for every 10 Siemens shares they own.  The report said Osram booked 237.4 million euros in write
downs last year, mainly for acquisitions including Siteco,
Traxon, after the companies purchased failed to meet
expectations. Siemens paid 254 million euros to acquire Siteco
in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
