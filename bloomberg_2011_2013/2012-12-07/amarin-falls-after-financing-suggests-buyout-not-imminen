Amarin Corp. (AMRN) , the maker of the
cholesterol-lowering medicine Vascepa, plunged the most in
almost two years after investors lost confidence that the
company will soon be acquired.  Amarin  declined  19 percent to $9.69 at 4 p.m. New York
time, the most since January 2010. The Dublin-based company’s
shares have gained 31 percent in the past 12 months.  Investors had expected Amarin to sell itself or find a
partner to market  Vascepa , the company’s treatment for severely
high levels of triglycerides, said Akiva Felt, an analyst for
Wedbush Securities in  San Francisco . Instead, the company
announced yesterday that it raised $100 million and started
hiring a sales force for the medicine. The financing from
Pharmakon Advisors and the start of a sales force may mean no
sale is on horizon, he said.  “The concern is that this may be a signal that a deal
isn’t imminent,” Felt said in a telephone interview yesterday.
“There had been expectations that there would be a strategic
agreement in the near term.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
