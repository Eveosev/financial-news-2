and a spot in college football’s national championship game,
became the first two-time winner of the Coach of the Year award.  Notre Dame completed a 12-0 regular season for the first
time since 1988, the year it last won the national title. The

Cincinnati, has amassed 28 victories during his three winning
seasons with the Fighting Irish.  To contact the reporter on this story:
