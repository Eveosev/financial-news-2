Gasoline weakened on the  Gulf Coast 
as refiners increased rates and inventories rose to the highest
level since September 2011.  Gasoline inventories on the Gulf Coast, or PADD 3 region,
rose 2.47 million barrels last week to 77.3 million, the highest
level since September 2011, according to Energy Department data.
 PADD 3 refiners  used 95.2 percent of capacity, higher than the
national average of 90.6 percent.  Reformulated  gasoline on the Gulf Coast  fell 2 cents to
20.25 cents below futures traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 1:52 p.m., the lowest level since Oct. 30.  “This is tied to refinery utilization being up,” said
Lewis Adam, president of ADMO Energy LLC, a supply consultant in
Kansas City, Missouri. “They’re running them hard. And gasoline
doesn’t have anyplace to go from the Gulf. It’s just not the
season for gasoline.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
