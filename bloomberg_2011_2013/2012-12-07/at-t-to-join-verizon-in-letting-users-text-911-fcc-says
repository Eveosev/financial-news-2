The four largest U.S. wireless
providers have agreed to accelerate the deployment of a feature
that lets people send emergency text messages to 911 services,
the Federal Communications Commission announced.  Under the agreement,  AT&T Inc. (T) , Verizon Wireless,  Sprint
Nextel Corp. (S)  and T-Mobile USA Inc. will do “major deployments”
of so-called text-to-911 in the U.S. next year, FCC Chairman
 Julius Genachowski  said in a news release.  The feature, which is to become available nationwide by May
15, 2014, will let most mobile users, including millions of
people with hearing or speech disabilities, send emergency texts
to 911 call centers, which are prepared to receive the messages,
Genachowski said.  “Access to 911 must catch up with how consumers
communicate in the 21st century -- and today, we are one step
closer towards that vital goal,” he said.  Next week, the FCC will begin considering steps to ensure
that other types of Internet-based message services offered by
companies such as  Facebook Inc. (FB)  make text-to-911 available to
consumers, the agency said.  While the feature is being phased in, the carriers have
pledged to send automatic “bounce back” text messages to
notify consumers if the service isn’t yet available, according
to the FCC, which said the “bounce backs” should be fully
available by June 30, 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
