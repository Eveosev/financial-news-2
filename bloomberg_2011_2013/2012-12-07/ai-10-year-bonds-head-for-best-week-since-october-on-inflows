Thailand ’s 10-year government bonds
completed a weekly advance on speculation the region’s improving
economic outlook and yield advantage over developed nations will
attract investors. The baht gained.  The  Asian Development Bank  said today that private
consumption and investment are bolstering Southeast Asian
economies even as the rest of the region is seen expanding less
than earlier estimated. International funds  bought  $391 million
more local sovereign notes than they sold in the first two days
of this week, according to the Thai Bond Market Association.  “Inflows into  Asia  will continue as the region’s growth
will accelerate, making it an attractive destination,” said
Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based strategist at Credit
Agricole CIB. “Moreover, higher  interest rates  will bring in
more funds, putting upward pressure on currencies.”  The yield on the 3.625 percent securities due June 2023
dropped four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, this week
to 3.55 percent in Bangkok, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It rose two basis points today.  Ten-year sovereign securities pay 1.58 percent in the U.S.,
1.75 percent in the U.K., 1.30 percent in  Germany  and 0.70
percent in Japan, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Developing Asian economies will grow 6 percent this year
and 6.6 percent in 2013, Manila-based ADB said in its Asian
Development Outlook 2012 Supplement today as it lowered its
forecasts by 0.1 percentage point for each period. Among the
region’s economic areas, it only raised its projections for
 Southeast Asia , predicting an expansion of 5.3 percent in 2012
from 5.2 percent earlier.  The baht advanced 0.1 percent from a week ago to 30.67 per
dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was little
changed today. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, fell
five basis points today to 3.89 percent. The gauge has declined
14 basis points from Nov. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
