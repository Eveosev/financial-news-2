Banque Centrale de Tunisie SA, the
central bank of  Tunisia , sold 25 billion yen ($303 million) of
Samurai bonds backed by the  Japan Bank for International
Cooperation .  The 10-year notes were priced to yield 1.19 percent, or 45
basis points more than the yen swap rate, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Mizuho Financial Group Inc. and Nomura
Holdings Inc. helped the north African borrower sell the bonds.  Tunisia is grappling with deteriorating finances after
tourist visits slumped 55 percent in the aftermath of a popular
uprising last year that ousted President Zine El Abidine Ben
Ali, leaving an Islamist party leading the nation. The guarantee
by  Japan ’s state-run lender is part of the Deauville Partnership
with Arab Countries in Transition, a global effort to support
nations undergoing political and social transition in the  Middle
East  and North Africa, according to an Oct. 12 statement by the
U.S. Treasury Department.  The central bank last sold yen-denominated notes in August
2007 when it issued 30 billion yen of 3.28 percent bonds,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The securities, due
2027, are quoted at 449 basis points more than the yen swap
rate, JS Price data show.  Tunisia’s government sold $485 million of 1.686 percent
seven-year bonds in July priced to yield 70 basis points more
than the Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The debt is backed by the U.S. Agency for International
Development, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
