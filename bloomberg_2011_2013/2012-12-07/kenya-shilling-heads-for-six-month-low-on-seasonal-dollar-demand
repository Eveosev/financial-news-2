Kenya ’s shilling weakened for a third
day, heading for the lowest in more than six months, as
businesses sought more dollars ahead of the holiday season.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy declined 0.1
percent to 86.05 a dollar as of 10:28 a.m. in Nairobi, the
capital, the weakest since June 1., according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  “The shilling has been under pressure this week from
businesses buying dollars to stock up their operations ahead of
the festive season,” Julius Kiriinya, a currency trader at
Nairobi-based African Banking Corp., said by phone. “With more
demand coming next week, the shilling may weaken to 86.10 to
86.50 levels” before regaining ground “on lower dollar demand
in the last days of the year,” he said.  The Central Bank of Kenya has been selling repurchase
agreements and term-auction deposits to reduce money supply and
support the shilling. The bank removed 26.08 billion shillings
from the money market from Dec. 3 through yesterday, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The shilling has been fairly stable this year, supported
by the relatively tight hold the central bank has kept on
banking sector liquidity,” Nairobi-based  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB) , said
today in a note to clients.  The Ugandan shilling weakened 0.2 percent to 2,694.49 a
dollar, while the Tanzanian shilling depreciated less than 0.1
percent to 1,602.25 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
