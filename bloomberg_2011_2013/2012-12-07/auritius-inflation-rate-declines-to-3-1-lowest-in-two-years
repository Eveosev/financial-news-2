Mauritius’s inflation rate fell for
the first time in three months in November to the lowest in more
than two years, the country’s data agency said.  Inflation slowed to 3.1 percent, the lowest since September
2010, from 4.2 percent in October, Statistics Mauritius, based
in the capital, Port Louis, said in a statement on its website
today. Prices rose 0.6 percent in the month, it said.  Higher fuel and foods costs will impact on the  consumer
price index  in the months ahead, according to the Bank of
Mauritius, which forecast the inflation rate would climb to 4.5
percent in December and reach 5.7 percent by the end of 2013.  Last month, the central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee,
led by Governor Rundheersing Bheenick, left its benchmark
 interest rate  unchanged at 4.9 percent. Some members of the
committee had called for an increase to ward off inflationary
pressures.  Mauritius, an Indian Ocean island nation with a population
of about 1.3 million people, is a net buyer of food and fuels.
Imports account for nearly 53 percent of the consumer price
basket, according to Bheenick.  The rupee has gained 1 percent against the dollar since the
MPC decision, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, trimming
its loss to 0.7 percent this quarter. The currency traded 0.8
percent stronger at 30.6 a dollar by 10:26 a.m. in  Port Louis .  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
