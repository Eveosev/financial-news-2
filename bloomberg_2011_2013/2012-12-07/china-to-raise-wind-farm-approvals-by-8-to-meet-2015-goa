China  gave 8 percent more approvals
to local governments to set up wind farms this year in a bid to
have 100 gigawatts of installed capacity by 2015.  The country’s National Energy Administration this year
issued about 29 gigawatts of permits, which are needed by local
authorities to allow wind-power projects, according to a
government official who asked not to be identified because he
isn’t authorized to speak to the media. The 2012 approvals
compare with 26.83 gigawatts granted last year. A fax and two
calls to the news department of the NEA weren’t answered.  The increase in permits may indicate a pick-up in wind-
power development, Justin Wu, head of wind analysis at Bloomberg
New Energy Finance, said by e-mail. Growth in the country’s wind
industry slowed in 2011 after the government tightened the
approval process for wind-energy projects to ease grid
congestion. The nation this year will report its first decline
in installations, with a 20 percent drop to 16.4 gigawatts
expected, NEF said in a Nov. 14 report.  Installations “will likely pick up again, but this time
much more gradually than before,” Wu said. “This could not
have come any sooner for many Chinese wind-turbine manufacturers
that are sitting on massive inventories of undelivered turbines
from the past several years.”  China, the world’s biggest wind-power market, had an
installed capacity of about 64 gigawatts of wind-energy at the
end of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
