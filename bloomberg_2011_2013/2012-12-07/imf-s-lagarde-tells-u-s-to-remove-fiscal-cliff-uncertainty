International Monetary Fund Managing
Director Christine Lagarde said that the U.S. has a duty “to
try to remove uncertainty and doubt as quickly as possible”
regarding the fiscal cliff, according to interview excerpts
posted on the  BBC  News  website   “The U.S. has an economic leadership in the world,” the
BBC quoted Lagarde as saying in the excerpts posted today. “To
protect that, to make sure that leadership endures, this
uncertainty has to be removed, because uncertainty fuels doubt
as to that leadership.”  The “fiscal cliff” refers to the more than $600 billion
in tax increases and spending cuts scheduled to take effect
early next year unless Congress acts.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
