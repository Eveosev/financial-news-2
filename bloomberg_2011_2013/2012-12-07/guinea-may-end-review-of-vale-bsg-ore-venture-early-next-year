Guinea  may complete a review into the
$10 billion  iron-ore  joint venture between  Vale SA (VALE3)  and BSG
Resources Ltd before the end of the first quarter of 2013, the
country’s Mines Minister Mohamed Lamine Fofana said today.  Vale, the world’s biggest iron-ore exporter, bought a 51
percent stake in the venture to develop the Simandou project in
the west African nation in 2010. The operation was put on hold
earlier this year amid government interventions and uncertainty
over the building of a new port and railway.  BSG Resources, a company controlled by Israeli businessman
Beny Steinmetz, said last month it had received a letter from
the Guinea government regarding an investigation into how it
obtained mining rights after they were removed by the state from
 Rio Tinto Plc (RIO)  in 2008.  The government could complete the review before the end of
March 2013 if discussions with the investors are a success,
Fofana said in an e-mailed statement released today by the
country’s presidency. “There is no uncertainty over the success
of Guinea’s Simandou project,” Fofana said.  Simandou has long been seen as one of the highest-quality
untapped iron-ore resources in the world. The Vale-BSG venture
is seeking to produce 50 million metric tons to 100 million tons
of high-grade iron ore annually and may cost $10 billion to
develop, according to BSG’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
