Canadian  employment  rose almost six
times faster than economists forecast in November, countering
recent signs of slowing economic growth.  The increase of 59,300 lowered the  unemployment rate  to 7.2
percent from 7.4 percent, the first decline in five months,
 Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa. Economists surveyed by
 Bloomberg News  projected a 10,000 gain in jobs and 7.4 percent
unemployment, according to median forecasts.  The Canadian dollar rose to a one-month high after the
report, which came three days after Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  kept in place the Group of Seven’s only bias to raise
 interest rates , citing an economy approaching full output. The
biggest job gain since March follows reports showing drops in
exports, investment and home resales.  “After a wave of unsettling numbers in Canada it’s a
relief to get a strong report and on an important indicator,”
 Doug Porter , deputy chief economist with BMO Capital Markets in
Toronto, said in a telephone interview. The figures will leave
 Bank of Canada  officials “comfortable sticking with their
hiking bias,” he said.  The Canadian dollar gained 0.3 percent to 98.86 cents per
 U.S. dollar  at 10:25 a.m. in Toronto after declining as much as
0.2 percent. It touched 98.77, the highest level since Nov. 7.
One Canadian dollar buys $1.0115. Investors erased almost all
bets on a central bank rate cut next year.  Full-time employment rose by 55,200 in November and part-
time positions increased 4,100, Statistics Canada said. Private
companies added 48,200 workers and public-sector employment
climbed 5,400.  Food Services  By industry, accommodation and food services led the
increase with 28,300 new jobs in November, followed by retail
and wholesale with 25,300 positions. Professional, scientific
and technical services rose by 22,800.  Enerkem Inc. said Oct. 24 it planned to hire about 30
workers to staff a new facility that will turn waste into
biofuel near Edmonton, Alberta.  “With the decline in the unemployment rate it was
unequivocally a good report,” said  Mark Chandler , head of
fixed-income strategy at Royal Bank of Canada’s Capital Markets
unit in Toronto. “It’s going to be hard to keep up the same job
machine” in coming months, he said.  Manufacturing employment dropped by 19,600 in November,
Statistics Canada said, while transportation and warehousing
declined by 13,600.  Workers designated by Statistics Canada as employees rose
by 53,700 while the self-employed increased by 5,800 in
November.  Hourly Earnings  Average hourly  earnings  of permanent employees rose 2.2
percent in November from a year earlier, compared with a 3.9
percent in the prior month.  A separate report showed that  labor productivity  fell 0.5
percent the third quarter, as companies increased hours worked
by 0.4 while output was little changed. Economists predicted the
measure would fall 0.4 percent, based on the median of 10
estimates in a Bloomberg  survey .  The U.S. Labor Department said today that employment
climbed by 146,000, exceeding the median estimate of 91
economists surveyed by Bloomberg that called for a gain of
85,000. The  unemployment rate  fell to 7.7 percent, the lowest
since December 2008, as size of the  labor force  shrank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
