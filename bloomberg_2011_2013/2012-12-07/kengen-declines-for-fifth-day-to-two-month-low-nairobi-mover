Kenya Electricity Generating Co. (KEGC) , the
East African nation’s biggest power producer, weakened for a
fifth day to the lowest level in more than a month.  The shares depreciated 2.2 percent to close at 8.8
shillings in Nairobi, the least since Oct. 23, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The stock has dropped 11.6 percent this
week, the steepest retreat over five days since July 2011.  “The price correction is due to closure of its books on
Dec. 5 for payment of dividend,” Eva Njuguna, an equity analyst
at Nairobi-based Sterling Securities Ltd., said by phone today.  KenGen, as the company is known, will pay 0.6 shilling per
share in January as dividend, according to an announcement it
made on the Nairobi Stock Exchange on Sept. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
