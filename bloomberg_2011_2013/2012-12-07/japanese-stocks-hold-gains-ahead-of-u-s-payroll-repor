The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  fell
from a seven-month high after a technical indicator signaled the
market may be overheating. Losses were limited as utilities rose
on prospects for a restart of nuclear reactors this summer.  Softbank Corp. (9984)  and KDDI Inc. led declines on the Nikkei 225
after the Nikkei newspaper reported rival NTT DoCoMo Inc. may
start offering the iPhone. Tokyo Electric Power Co. soared 13
percent to lead gains on the Nikkei 225. Sharp Corp. jumped 8.5
percent, extending its four-day gain to 26 percent after
announcing a capital alliance with Qualcomm Inc.  The Nikkei 225 slid 0.2 percent to 9,527.39 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo after rising as much as 0.3 percent. The gauge
gained 0.9 percent this week, its fourth weekly gain. The Topix
Index rose 0.2 percent to 790.24, with about eight stocks
falling for every six that gained.  “With the upcoming elections the measure has risen quite a
bit, so there’s also some profit-taking going on,” said
 Soichiro Monji , chief strategist at Tokyo-based Daiwa SB
Investments Ltd., which manages the equivalent of about 5
trillion yen ($61 billion). “If the utilities can restart their
nuclear reactors by summer, that’s definitely positive for
them.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose less than
0.1 percent today. The gauge gained 0.3 yesterday as Apple Inc.
rebounded from its biggest drop in four years and investors
weighed prospects for a budget deal in  Washington .  Value of Assets  The Topix traded at 0.9 times  book value  today, compared
with 2.1 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5 for the
Europe Stoxx 600 Index. A number less than one means that
companies can be bought for less than the value of their assets.  The benchmark Nikkei 225 traded at its highest level since
April 26 yesterday, with its  relative strength index  at over 70.
Some investors view a reading above 70 as a signal the gauge is
overbought.  “There’s definitely a sense the market is overheating,”
said Daiwa SB’s Monji. “But the Nikkei is doing well despite
the profit-taking.”  Softbank and  KDDI Corp. (9433) , both iPhone sellers, fell 2.1
percent to 3,005 yen and 3 percent to 5,880 yen, respectively.
NTT DoCoMo advanced 3.5 percent to 122,300 yen. The carrier may
start selling the iPhone after its number of mobile subscribers
declined for the first time in five years in November, the
Nikkei reported.  Utilities rose 2.9 percent as a group today, the biggest
gain among the Topix’s 33 industry groups. The Nuclear
Regulation Authority Secretariat may start safety checks on
nuclear reactors this spring and some may be restarted in the
summer,  Kyodo News  reported, without saying who it got the
information from.  Utilities Advance  Tokyo Electric Power jumped 13 percent to 149 yen, the
biggest gain on the  Nikkei 225. (NKY)  Kansai Electric Power Co.
advanced 4.5 percent to 793 yen. Chubu Electric Power Co., which
supplies electricity in the central Japan region, gained 5.9
percent to 1,120 yen.  Sharp jumped 8.5 percent to 216 yen, the second-biggest
gain on the Nikkei 225. The stock has risen four days since the
television maker said on Dec. 4 it will sell  shares  to Qualcomm
Inc. for a partnership to develop displays.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index lost 2.6 percent
to 16.94 today, indicating traders expect a swing of about 4.9
percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
