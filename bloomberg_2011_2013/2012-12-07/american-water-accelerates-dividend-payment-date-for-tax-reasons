American Water Works Co. (AWK) , the biggest
publicly traded water company in the U.S., declared a quarterly
cash dividend of 25 cents a share and accelerated the payment to
Dec. 28 to take advantage of 2012 tax rates.  The regular quarterly cash dividend, historically paid in
March, is now payable at the end of the month to shareholders of
record as of Dec. 20, Jeff Sterba, president and chief executive
officer of American Water, said in a statement.  The board decided to accelerate the payment “due to the
uncertainty over the tax rates that will be in effect in 2013,”
Sterba said. American Water supports the extension of the
dividend tax rate and capital gains tax rate “because we know
that it will have a real impact on our investors.”  The company’s shares have risen 18 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
