Oleg Shamonov,  Russia ’s chief climate
negotiator, speaks about the nation’s surplus Assigned Amount
Units under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. He commented to reporters
Dec. 5 at Doha climate talks after the nation’s official press
conference.  Russia’s emissions were 1.6 billion metric tons of carbon
dioxide equivalent in 2010, about half its yearly quota under
the Kyoto Protocol of 3.2 billion tons, according to data
published this month on the website of the United Nations
Convention on Climate Change in Bonn.  On what should happen with the nation’s AAU surplus:  “It’s not for Russia to discuss. It’s a question for the
world, for the negotiating process to discuss how to deal. The
first step is we have to stick to the legal provisions of the
legal instrument and then we decide what we are going to do.”  On implications for countries in the protocol:  “You remember those who are in compliance. They are
incentivized. They can add.”  People “forget about something: that it has a very direct
relevance to the compliance regime and it would be only playing
into the hands of those who are not in compliance. So you are
now actually focusing on Russia as a bad guy for getting that
way and at the same time you will be doing actually a tremendous
disservice to those who are not compliant because if the
carryover right now is canceled then the entire system of
incentives and enforcement would evaporate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
