Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
widened from a five-month low on signs of a glut of the grain-
based additive.  The biofuel fell to 22.24 cents below gasoline, up from
yesterday’s 18.79 cents, the lowest level since July 18. The
spread has averaged 62 cents this year, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  “Ethanol’s at a level where it’s not going to gain on
gasoline too much more,” said Jason Ward, an analyst at
Northstar Commodity Investments LLC in  Minneapolis .  Denatured ethanol for January delivery dropped 3.4 cents,
or 1.4 percent, to $2.375 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the lowest since Nov. 16. Prices have climbed 7.8 percent
this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in New York fell 0.5 cent
to $2.495 a gallon and on the West Coast the additive slipped
1.5 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $2.52, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf added 0.5 cent to $2.46 a gallon
and in Chicago the biofuel lost 0.5 cent to $2.395.  Gasoline for January delivery gained 0.05 cent to settle at
$2.5974. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Corn Falls  Corn for March delivery tumbled 14.25 cents, or 1.9
percent, to $7.3725 a bushel in  Chicago . One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  An Energy Department report released Dec. 5 showed ethanol
 stockpiles  in the week ended Nov. 30 surged 5.4 percent to 19.3
million barrels, the highest since July 27, while  production 
climbed 4 percent to 835,000 barrels a day, the biggest weekly
gain since Oct. 14, 2011, and the highest level since June 29.  “If you look at the inventory numbers, I was surprised
production jumped so much,” Ward said. “Why would you be
producing more at the worst losses of the year? I was a little
discouraged by the production numbers.”  Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 30 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, down from
32 cents yesterday, excluding the revenue that can be pocketed
from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of
ethanol production that can be fed to livestock, according to
data collected by Bloomberg.  Taking the profit from the dried distillers’ grains into
account, ethanol mills are losing about 17 cents on each gallon,
Ward estimated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
