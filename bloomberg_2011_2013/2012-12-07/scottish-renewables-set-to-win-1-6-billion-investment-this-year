Scotland  will get more than 1 billion
pounds ($1.6 billion) of renewable energy investment in 2012 as
it seeks to generate all its power from clean sources by 2020.  The renewable power industry won more than 900 million
pounds of investment in the first half, Glasgow-based Scottish
Renewables said today in an e-mailed statement, citing figures
from the U.K. Department of Energy and Climate Change.  “That investment is of course supporting thousands of jobs
across Scotland in project management, civil engineering,
professional services and operations and maintenance,” said
Niall Stuart, chief executive officer of Scottish Renewables.  While 800 million pounds was in onshore wind, none was
invested in turbines at sea in the half, according to the data.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
