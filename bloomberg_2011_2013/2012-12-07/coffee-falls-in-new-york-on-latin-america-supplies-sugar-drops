Coffee fell in New York on signs
supplies from Latin America are overwhelming roaster demand.
Sugar also declined.  Colombia’s 2013 coffee crop will expand to 10 million bags
from 8 million bags this year, the Colombian Coffee Growers
Federation’s Tokyo-based green coffee manager said at a coffee
conference in  Vietnam  today. Stockpiles of beans in warehouses
monitored by ICE Futures U.S. are up 65 percent this year, the
biggest jump in 12 years, as  Brazil  harvested a record crop.  “We’re maybe seeing more attention on the Latin America
crops,” Andrea Thompson, head of research and analysis at
CoffeeNetwork in  Belfast , Northern Ireland, said by phone today.
“There’s definitely signs the crops there are inching up.”  Arabica coffee for March delivery fell 1 percent to $1.494
a pound by 8:01 a.m. in New York on ICE. The price is down 34
percent this year, making it the biggest loser among the 24
commodities tracked by the Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge, which
fell 1.6 percent. Robusta coffee dropped 1.4 percent to $1,878 a
metric ton (85.18 cents a pound) on NYSE Liffe in  London .  CoffeeNetwork is currently looking at world coffee output
of 62.6 million bags and global consumption of 61.7 million
bags, leaving a surplus of 900,000 bags, Thompson said in an e-
mailed commentary today.  Raw sugar futures dropped 0.5 percent to 19.26 cents a
pound and cocoa in New York advanced 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
