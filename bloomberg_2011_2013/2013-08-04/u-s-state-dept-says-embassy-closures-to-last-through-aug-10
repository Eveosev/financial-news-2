Today’s closure of some U.S.
embassies and consulates in predominantly Muslim countries is
being extended for one week through Aug. 10, the State
Department said.  “This is not an indication of a new threat stream, merely
an indication of our commitment to exercise caution and take
appropriate steps to protect our employees including local
employees and visitors to our facilities,”  Jen Psaki , a
department spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
