Javier Solana, who led the European
Union’s negotiations with  Iran  until 2009, said an agreement on
the country’s nuclear program during President Hassan Rohani was
possible, Tehran-based newspaper Shargh reported.  “Based on what I know of him, he is a politician who’s
perceptive and open minded,” Solana, who had met Rohani when
the Iranian cleric was the country’s top nuclear negotiator,
said in an interview with the newspaper. “He is someone with
whom one can come to an agreement.”  Solana urged Iran and western nations, which have been at
odds over the country’s nuclear work for over a decade, to
“take this opportunity seriously” and strive for an accord,
according to the newspaper. The U.S. and its allies say Iran is
seeking to develop nuclear weapons. The Islamic republic says
the program is for civilian purposes only.  Solana is in Tehran to attend Rohani’s inauguration
ceremony today after he was endorsed by Supreme Leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei for the job yesterday. He succeeds Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
