Job vacancies at London’s financial-services companies fell 12 percent last month, as tougher rules
on capital deter banks from hiring, recruitment firm  Astbury
Marsden  said.  New  job openings  in the British capital’s City and Canary
Wharf financial districts fell to 2,172 in July from 2,462 in
June, the London-based recruiter said in a statement today. The
figure is down 27 percent from July last year.  Positive results for some banks is “fueling renewed
confidence,” said chief operating officer  Mark Cameron , in the
statement. “However, this has not yet translated into an
increase in new roles across the industry as regulators’ more
stringent requirements on capital are making banks more cautious
about expanding headcount.”  Hiring across financial services remains “patchy” as
companies grapple with tighter rules on capital, the recruiter
said.  Barclays Plc (BARC) , the U.K.’s second-biggest bank by assets,
last week announced plans to raise 7.8 billion pounds ($11.8
billion) after the  Bank of England ’s Prudential Regulation
Authority imposed a 3 percent leverage ratio target on lenders.  Rule changes are forcing banks to decide “which areas of
their business are going to be most profitable, and where they
should best focus resource,” Cameron said. “Many banks have
put recruitment on hold while they review their operations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
