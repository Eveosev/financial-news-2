ING Groep NV (INGA)  is in exclusive talks on
selling its Korean life-insurance operations to private-equity
fund MBK Partners, the Wall Street Journal said, citing
unidentified people familiar with the talks.  MBK offered to buy all of ING Life Insurance Korea for $1.6
billion, the WSJ reported today.  ING, the biggest Dutch financial-services company, agreed
less than a month ago to sell its South Korean investment-management business to  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) ,  Australia â€™s largest
investment bank. ING, located in Amsterdam, said then it still
planned to sell the rest of its Asian insurance and investment-management units, including ING Life Insurance Korea.  The Dutch company agreed to sell its global insurance and
investment-management operations to win European Union approval
for bailouts in 2008 and 2009 and has since disposed of more
than 25 assets for at least 20 billion euros ($26.6 billion).
MBK is based in  Seoul  and has more than $6.3 billion under
management, according to its website.  Raymond Vermeulen, an Amsterdam-based spokesman for ING,
declined to comment on the divestment of ING Life Insurance
Korea in a text message.  To contact the reporter on this story:
