Aldar Properties PJSC (ALDAR)  rose to the
 highest  in more than three years on investor bets  Abu Dhabi ’s
largest property developer will report better-than-expected
earnings after acquiring a competitor in June.  The shares, which have  more than doubled this year,   jumped
7.7 percent to 2.95 dirhams, the highest since June 2010, at the
close in the emirate. The stock was the biggest gainer on Abu
Dhabi’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI) , which increased 0.2 percent, bringing
the gauge’s surge in 2013 to 49 percent.  Aldar completed the acquisition of Sorouh Real Estate Co.
in June, creating a company with $13 billion in assets, and is
set to announce this week the first earnings for the combined
entity. The company will report on Aug. 6 second-quarter profit
of 335 million dirhams ($91 million), according to Securities
and Investment Co. estimates on Bloomberg, after profit of 154.3
million dirhams in the first quarter.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR)  on
July 29 said second-quarter earnings rose 10 percent, beating
analysts’ estimates, as Dubai’s largest developer completed
previously delayed projects.  “Investors are anticipating a positive surprise when the
earnings come out at a time that real estate sentiment has been
helped by Emaar’s results,” said Mohammed Ali Yasin, managing
director of NBAD Securities in Abu Dhabi. “The overall momentum
is more technical than fundamental, as speculators are trying to
break the 3-dirham level amid lower resistance” as most traders
have exited ahead of the Eid Al Fitr holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
