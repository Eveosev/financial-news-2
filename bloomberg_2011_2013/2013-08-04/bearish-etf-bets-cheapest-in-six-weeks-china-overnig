Options traders are paying the least
in six weeks to protect against drops in the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S. on prospects the government
will take steps to sustain growth in Asia’s biggest economy.  The cost of six-month puts on the iShares China Large-Cap
ETF had a 3.4-point spread with calls Aug. 2, the smallest gap
since June 19, options data compiled by Bloomberg showed. The

longest advance since January, led by  Ctrip.com International

an interbank cash squeeze sent money-market rates to record
highs. The People’s Bank of China last week added funds into the
financial system for the first time in five months. China’s
cabinet pledged to prevent growth from slipping below a
“reasonable” level, after an official manufacturing index for
July unexpectedly rose.  “The market has already priced in a lot of the negative
issues in China,” Jay Jacobs, a research analyst at Global X
Funds, a New York-based exchange-traded fund firm that manages
$2 billion in assets, said by phone Aug. 2. “Based on the
commitment we’ve seen from the government in terms of solving
the liquidity crunch, we’ll see stabilization in the market.”  Implied volatility , used to gauge the cost of options, for
six-month contracts with an exercise price 10 percent below the
China ETF cost retreated to 25.2 last week from a nine-month
high of 29.6 reached June 25. The measure for calls 10 percent
above slipped 14 percent to 21.9.  Chinese ETF  The China ETF advanced 0.7 percent to an eight-week high of
$34.97 in New York, and the China-US gauge gained 2 percent to

slipped 0.2 percent to 9,734.81, while the Shanghai Composite
Index added 0.9 percent to 2,029.42 in a second week of gains.  The July reading of China’s official Purchasing Managers’
Index rose to 50.3 from 50.1 in June and exceeded the analysts’
median estimate of 49.8, data showed last week. Government
agencies are scheduled to release July trade figures and
inflation data this week.  Ctrip surged 20 percent to $43.30 last week, the most since
May 10. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. boosted the share-price
estimate on the Shanghai-based company’s American depositary
