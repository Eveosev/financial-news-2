Jerusalem Economy (ECJM)  Ltd. climbed to the
highest level in almost two years as investors bet the
underlying business at Israel’s third-largest real estate
developer by assets is recovering and boosting access to cash.  The shares of the company led by businessman Eliezer
Fishman rose 4.8 percent to 29.93 shekels, the highest level
since November 2011, at the close in  Tel Aviv . Israel’s TA-100
Index increased 0.3 percent.  Jerusalem Economy in June agreed to sell Canada’s
Bridlewood mall for C$63 million ($61 million). In April,
another unit of Jerusalem Economy sold a  New York  project for
$61 million with a partner. London-traded  Mirland Development
Corporation (MLD)  Plc, of which Jerusalem Economy holds a 30.5 percent
stake, on July 30 raised 240 million shekels ($67 million) in
bonds. The shares of Mirland, whose investments in Eastern
Europe were hit by the 2008 economic crisis,  have gained 50 
percent this year.  “The company has been making a slow comeback, selling off
assets and its businesses have been able to return to the  debt
market ,” Shay Lipman, an analyst at I.B.I.-Israel Brokerage in
Tel Aviv, said by telephone. “It’s an overall improving
backdrop for the company.” Lipman recommends investors buy the
stock.  Jerusalem Economy shares have gained 59 percent this year
 compared with  a 5 percent increase in the TA-100 Index. Lipman
recommends investors buy the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
