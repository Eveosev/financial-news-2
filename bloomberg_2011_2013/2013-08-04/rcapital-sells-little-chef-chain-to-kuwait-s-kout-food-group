Rcapital Ltd., a U.K. investor in
distressed assets, sold roadside restaurants chain Little Chef
to  Kuwait ’s Kout Food Group after returning the company to
profit.  Rcapital, which bought Little Chef in 2007, sold the
restaurant chain to Kout, which already runs more than 40 Burger
King and KFC outlets in the U.K., for an undisclosed sum, the
company said in an e-mailed statement today.  “Looking back, Little Chef was the biggest and longest
turnaround in our nine-year history,” Rcapital Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Constable said in the statement.  Little Chef  has been operating in the U.K. for more than 50
years, according to its website. The first restaurant opened in
Reading, Berkshire, in 1958, the same year Britain got its first
motorway. The chain currently employs 1,100 staff in 78 outlets
and serves 3 million cups of tea a year.  “KFGR-UK has exciting plans to revitalise the Little Chef
brand,” KFGR-UK Chairwoman Fadwa Al Homaizi said in the
statement. “Little Chef will benefit from a process of brand
renewal in keeping with current trends, supported by traditional
British values.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
