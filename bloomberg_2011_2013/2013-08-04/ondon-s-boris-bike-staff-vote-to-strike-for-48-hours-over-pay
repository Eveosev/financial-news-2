Workers operating  Serco Group Plc (SRP) ’s
“Boris Bike” cycle-rental system in London voted to strike for
48 hours over pay and work conditions, the RMT union said.  RMT members, who make up more than 90 percent of the
system’s workforce, will walk out at 9 p.m. local time on Aug.
11, the union said today in an e-mailed statement. It’s
disputing a 2 percent pay increase for 2013, changes to shift
patterns, alleged bullying and Serco’s refusal to reach a formal
agreement on travel time and allowances, the statement showed.  More than 22 million  journeys  have been made since the
bicycle-hire program started in July 2010, according to the
website of Transport for London. London Mayor  Boris Johnson ,
after whom the bikes are nicknamed, adopted the project as part
of his manifesto to oust predecessor  Ken Livingstone , who
initiated the program.  “We hope that Boris Johnson and his contractors Serco will
now meet with RMT to find a fair solution to this dispute,”  Bob
Crow , the union’s general secretary, said in the statement.  The cycles can be rented from more than 550 docking
stations located across London’s center and east, according to
Transport for London. The system, operated by Serco and
sponsored by Barclays Plc, is scheduled to  expand  into southwest
London starting in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
