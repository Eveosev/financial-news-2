Australia reached 172-7 on day four
of the third Ashes cricket Test against England, a lead of 331
runs, as play was ended early because of bad light.  David Warner  made 41 at Old Trafford in Manchester. Captain
Michael Clarke is not out 30 and  Ryan Harris  has yet to score.  The umpires called a halt to play at 4:26 p.m., leaving the
visitors facing a tough task if they’re to declare and bowl
England out in the day remaining. A draw would ensure that the
hosts retain the Ashes trophy.  Earlier today, England was all out for 368 after resuming
on 294-7. Stuart Broad was dismissed for 32, while Graeme Swann
scored 11 and Matt Prior 30.  Kevin Pietersen had scored 113 in leading England’s reply
to Australia’s first innings 527-7 declared. Peter Siddle took
4-63 and Mitchell Starc 3-76.  England  won the first two games of the five-Test series and
would claim the Ashes for the third straight time with a draw or
victory.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
