Israeli President  Shimon Peres  said a
visit to the Middle East by FC Barcelona, the most successful
European soccer team in the past decade, should contribute to
renewed regional peace efforts.  Peres welcomed four-time world player of the year Lionel Messi and his teammates on the Spanish club to Jerusalem today,
a day after they were greeted in the West Bank city of Bethlehem
by Palestinian President  Mahmoud Abbas .  Barcelona played exhibition matches with Israelis and
Palestinians. In between the contests, the Spanish champions
visited Christian and Jewish shrines and waded through crowds of
fans in both Israeli and Palestinian territory.  The club’s example should help both peoples “score the
goal we all hope for -- the goal of peace,” Peres said in a
press release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
