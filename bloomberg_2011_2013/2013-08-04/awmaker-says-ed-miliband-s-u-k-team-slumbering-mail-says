A U.K. lawmaker from  Ed Miliband ’s
opposition  Labour Party  said his party’s leadership is making
“a huge mistake” by “slumbering” during Parliament’s summer
break instead of attacking Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s
Conservatives, the Mail on Sunday reported today.  Lawmaker Graham Stringer made the comments as a Survation
Ltd. poll for the newspaper found 53 percent of Labour
supporters agreed Miliband is “hesitant.” Forty-eight percent
said he is “trying to find himself”, 45 percent called him
“lackluster” and 37 percent “confused.”  “Labour’s shadow cabinet is almost invisible in repose
when it’s an ideal time to attack ministers who are on the
beach,” Stringer told the Mail on Sunday. “It’s a huge mistake
and it’s not good enough. We need to be energetic, not
slumbering.”  Stringer is the second rank-and-file Labour legislator to
attack Miliband’s leadership in recent days. Lawmaker George Mudie told the  BBC ’s “World at One” radio program on Aug. 1
the party leadership appears “hesitant” and “confused”
because Miliband has failed to spell out a clear agenda to
voters.  Even so, Survation’s Aug. 2 poll of 1,001 voters online
gave Labour an eight-point lead on voting intentions in May 2015
elections, with 36 percent to 28 percent for Cameron’s Tories.
Ten percent of respondents said they would vote for the Liberal
Democrats and 18 percent for the U.K. Independence Party, which
campaigns for withdrawal from the European Union. No margin of
error was given.  To contact the reporter on this story:
