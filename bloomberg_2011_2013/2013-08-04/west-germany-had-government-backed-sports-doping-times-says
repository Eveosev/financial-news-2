The former West Germany had a
government-backed sports-doping program, the U.K.’s  Sunday Times 
reported, citing a study to be published by Humboldt University,
Berlin.  The doping may have extended to the West Germany team that
lost the 1966 World Cup soccer final to  England , the Times said.
Three unidentified German players tested positive for a banned
stimulant, ephedrine, although it could have been in a
decongestant taken for colds, the newspaper added.  Researchers said West German players in the 1954 World Cup
final win over  Hungary  were given shots declared as vitamin C
that actually contained the amphetamine pervitin, the Times
said.  The 800-page study, to be published “soon,” showed that
the drug program lasted for decades, involved all sports and
included under-age athletes, according to the newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
