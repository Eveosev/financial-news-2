Missy Franklin became the first woman
to win six gold medals at swimming’s World Championships, yet it
was fellow American Katie Ledecky who won the award for top
female of the meet in Barcelona.  Franklin, 18, swam the first leg of the U.S. team’s victory
in the women’s 400-meter medley yesterday, when she collected
her third relay gold to go along with wins in the 200m freestyle
and the 100m and 200m backstroke events.  Franklin, who won four gold medals at the 2012 Olympics in
 London , surpassed the previous women’s record of five golds at
the World Championships set by Tracy Caulkins of the U.S. in
1978 and matched by Libby Trickett of  Australia  in 2007.  Michael Phelps , Mark Spitz and Kristin Otto are the only other swimmers
to win six or more gold medals at the World Championships or the
Olympics, as Otto set the women’s Olympic record with six at the
1998 Seoul Games.  “I still can’t really believe that it happened,” Franklin
was quoted as saying by  USA Swimming . “Coming into this meet, I
wanted to see where I was after London. I had some really great
races that I’m really proud of, and there’s a bunch where I know
there’s a lot of room to improve on.”  Ledecky, 16, received the meet’s top female swimmer award
after winning four gold medals -- including three in individual
events -- and setting world records in the 800m and 1,500m
freestyle. She also set an American record in the 400m free.  The U.S. led the 180 competing nations at the World
Championships with  34 medals, including 15 gold . China was
second with 26 medals and 14 golds.  The U.S. missed a chance to win another gold medal on the
final day of the meet yesterday, when its relay team finished
about 1 1/2 seconds ahead of  France  but was disqualified for a
false start in the exchange from backstroke to breaststroke.  To contact the reporter on this story:
