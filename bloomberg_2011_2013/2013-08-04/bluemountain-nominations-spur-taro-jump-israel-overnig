Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TARO) 
capped a six-week rally as BlueMountain Capital Management LLC,
the firm that profited from  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s trading loss,
nominated two board members for the Israeli drugmaker.  Shares of the Yakum, Israel-based company jumped 4.5
percent in the five-day period ended Aug. 2. The Bloomberg
Israel-US Equity Index gained 2.4 percent for the week, led by
 SodaStream (SODA)  International Ltd.  EZchip Semiconductor Ltd. (EZCH)  rallied
5.5 percent to trade at the largest premium among dual-listed
companies.  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA)  posted the
biggest weekly drop in 2013 as profit declined.  BlueMountain, the New York-based hedge fund that holds a
1.5 percent  stake  in Taro, reaped as much as $300 million from
JPMorgan’s more than $6.2 billion trading loss last year by
betting against the bank and then helping it unwind positions,
people with knowledge of the matter said at the time. Taro has
rallied 27 percent since Feb. 8 when  Sun Pharmaceutical
Industries Ltd. (SUNP) , its majority shareholder, ended a bid to take
over the company at a discount.  “The increased activism by BlueMountain will certainly
keep a check and a balance with respect to Sun’s control of
Taro,” Mitchell Sacks, the chief investment officer of Grand
Slam Asset Management which owns 65,000 Taro shares, said in a
telephone interview from  Fort Lee , New Jersey on Aug. 2.
“They’ve tried to acquire us and they failed because they came
out with offers that were substantially below what the company
was worth.”  ‘Pivotal Role’  “There exists a significant ongoing opportunity to create
 shareholder value  at Taro,” BlueMountain said in a statement
Aug. 1. One of the two board members nominated by the hedge-fund
firm is a former chief operating officer of Teva.  Sun, India’s largest drugmaker by market value, terminated
a six-year effort to acquire the stock that it doesn’t already
own in Taro as shareholders of the Israeli pharmaceutical
company opposed the $39.50-a-share deal, the two companies said
in a statement Feb. 8.  Taro, whose products include treatments for head lice and
skin discoloration, climbed last week to $65.80, after surging
to the highest price since February 2004 on July 29.  The Bloomberg Israel-US measure rose to 97.89 last week,
adding to its 13 percent gain this year. The  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  today
extended last week’s 1.7 percent drop, slipping 0.1 percent to
1,206.31 at 9:59 a.m. in Israel.  SodaStream, a maker of home soda machines, surged 14
percent to a one-month high of $65.63. The Airport City, Israel-based company raised its 2013 sales outlook on July 31 and
reported earnings that beat analysts’ estimates.  Teva Slumps  EZchip, based in Yokneam, Israel, surged to $32.20, the
highest price since Feb. 12. The chipmaker rallied for nine
straight days in New York and closed at a 1.8 percent  premium  to
its Tel Aviv-listed shares. The Israel shares this morning
narrowed the gap, gaining 1.4 percent to 114.40, or $32.07.  Teva, the world’s largest maker of generic drugs, slumped
4.5 percent to $38.90 for the week. Second-quarter profit fell
8.9 percent as the Petach Tikva, Israel-based company introduced
fewer new generic medicines. The shares in  Tel Aviv  today fell
0.9 percent to 137.90 shekels, or $38.66.  The shekel pared a weekly gain on Aug. 2 after Leonardo Leiderman became the second candidate in a week to withdraw from
the race to take over the  Bank of Israel . Jacob Frenkel
announced on July 29 he was pulling out. The currency, which
rose 0.4 percent last week to 3.5668 per  U.S. dollar , lost 0.1
percent on Aug. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
