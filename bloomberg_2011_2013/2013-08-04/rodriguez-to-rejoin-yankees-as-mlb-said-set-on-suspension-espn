Alex Rodriguez says he will leave for
 Chicago  to rejoin the  New York  Yankees tomorrow, when Major
League Baseball may suspend the third baseman through 2014 for
his alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs, ESPN reported.  Rodriguez, who walked four times and scored on Jose
Pirela’s home run during his final rehabilitation game yesterday
with the Double-A Trenton Thunder, said he would work out today
before going to Chicago.  His plans followed efforts by Rodriguez and the players’
union to reach an agreement with Major League Baseball to reduce
the anticipated 214-game suspension, the New York Daily News
reported, citing an unidentified person in baseball familiar
with the case. The Yankees management also refused to discuss a
financial settlement on his contract, baseball’s richest at 10
years and $275 million, the newspaper said.  The league offered to drop a lifetime ban if Rodriguez
allowed the arbitrator to charge him with more than a 50-game
suspension, ESPN said, citing a person representing Rodriguez.  Rodriguez rejected that offer, noting that the Joint Drug
agreement provides for only a 50-game suspension for use of
performance-enhancing drugs, ESPN said.  If Rodriguez is declared ineligible to play during an
appeal of his disciplinary action, he stands to lose $34.2
million in salary, the sports network said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
