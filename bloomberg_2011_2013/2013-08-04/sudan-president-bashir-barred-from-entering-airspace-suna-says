Saudi Arabia refused to allow a plane
carrying Sudanese President Umar al-Bashir to enter its
territory, forcing it to turn back to the capital Khartoum,
 Sudan ’s state-run Suna news agency reported.  Al-Bashir was on his way to attend Iranian President Hassan Rohani’s swearing-in before the parliament in Tehran, using a
plane rented from a Saudi company, according to Suna.  Ten foreign presidents and senior representatives from 52
nations attended Rohani’s inauguration, including leaders from
Afghanistan, Pakistan and Lebanon, according to Iranian state-run television.  Ties between Shiite Muslim  Iran  and the six-nation Gulf
Cooperation Council, which is ruled by Sunni Muslims,
deteriorated this year after Saudi Arabia and Bahrain said they
arrested spy rings linked to Iran.  To contact the reporter on this story:
