Andy Murray , who is trying to
become the first British man to win a Grand Slam tournament in
76 years, won the first set of a wind-swept U.S. Open final 7-6
(12-10) against defending champion Novak Djokovic of  Serbia .  There were four service breaks in the first eight games as
the players adjusted to the swirling 16 mile-per-hour (26
kilometer-per-hour) wind. Playing tentatively instead of going
for winners, the two men exchanged 54 strokes on one point in
the sixth game of the 87-minute set. The tiebreaker lasted 24
minutes.  The 2-5 betting favorite heading into today’s match, the
second-seeded Djokovic has never lost to a lower-seeded player
in seven appearances at the season’s final Grand Slam event.  Murray, 25, who beat Djokovic, 25, en route to his gold
medal at the London Olympics last month, came into the match
with an extra day of rest after Djokovic’s semifinal match was
pushed to yesterday due to wind and rain.  It is the fifth straight year that the U.S. Open men’s
final has been held on a Monday after a 21-year run of on-time
finishes.  To contact the reporter for this story:
