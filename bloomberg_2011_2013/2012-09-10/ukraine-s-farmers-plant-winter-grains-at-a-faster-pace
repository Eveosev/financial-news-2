Ukraine’s farmers sowed 497,000
hectares (1.2 million acres) with winter grains, or 6 percent of
the planned area, on warm, wet weather, the  Agriculture Ministry 
said.  That compares with 260,000 hectares a year earlier, the
ministry, based in the capital, Kiev, said today by e-mail.  Ukraine has planted 452,000 hectares with winter wheat as
of today and 7,000 hectares of barley, according to the
statement. Winter rapeseed was sown on 841,000 hectares, or 89
percent of the planned area, the ministry said.  The country’s farmers also reaped 861,000 metric tons of
corn from 249,000 hectares with an average yield of 3.46 tons
per hectare, the ministry said. The yield was 4.76 tons last
year, it said.  The country has started harvesting sugar beets. It reaped
291,000 tons of beets, compared with 893,000 tons in 2011. The
average yield is 3.5 tons a hectare, comparable with last year,
the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
