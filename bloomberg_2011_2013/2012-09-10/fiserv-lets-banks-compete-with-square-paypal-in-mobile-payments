Fiserv Inc. (FISV) , a provider of
transaction and technology services for financial institutions,
is introducing a mobile payment device that will allow banks to
compete with Square Inc. and  EBay Inc. (EBAY) ’s PayPal.  Fiserv, which has 16,000 clients, will announce today a
black attachment called SpotPay that lets iPhones and iPads
accept credit and debit cards, and deposit checks into bank
accounts, Rahul Gupta, group president of digital channels at
Fiserv, said in an interview.  Fiserv’s entry further increases competition in the micro-
merchant processing market, set to reach $1 billion in 2016, up
from $30 million last year, according to researcher Aite Group
LLC. Square, PayPal and  VeriFone Systems Inc. (PAY)  are among
companies that already offer merchants similar attachments.
 Groupon Inc. (GRPN) , the daily coupon website, is testing an attachment
as well, Bloomberg reported in May.  “We just see the success the Square product has had out
there, and many of our clients have expressed an interest,”
Gupta said. “We view it as an extension of the banking
relationship.”  Several banks will start offering the matchbox-sized device
for their small-business customers this fall, and Fiserv plans a
wider roll-out of the gadget and related services in mid-2013,
Gupta said.  Participating banks will market the device to their
customers. Fees will be similar to Square’s, although banks may
choose to offer discounts and other benefits, Gupta said.  -- Editors: Reed Stevenson, Stephen West  To contact the reporter on this story:
