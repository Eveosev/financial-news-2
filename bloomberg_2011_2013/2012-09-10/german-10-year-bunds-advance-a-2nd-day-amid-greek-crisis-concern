Italian  10-year bonds  snapped a
five-day advance, leading declines in  Europe ’s lower-rated debt,
amid concern conditions imposed on nations seeking assistance
may hamper requests for European Central Bank bond purchases.  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield rose after last week climbing
the most in six after ECB President  Mario Draghi  announced
details of an unlimited asset-purchase program to tame the
region’s debt crisis. Spanish notes dropped before a German high
court decision on bailout funding due Sept. 12 and after Greek
Prime Minister Antonis Samaras yesterday failed to win agreement
from his coalition partners on spending cuts required by lenders
to his country to release funds.  “Greece shows us how difficult life can be within a
program and the ECB’s purchases are conditional,”  John Wraith ,
a fixed-income strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said
in a Bloomberg Television interview with  Mark Barton . “If the
Spanish or Italian governments start to pull back on the
prospect of entering any program, then that will give the market
a scent of blood and there will be periods where the yields come
under upward pressure.”  The rate on Italian 10-year debt climbed 11 basis points,
or 0.11 percentage point, to 5.17 percent at 4 p.m. London time.
It jumped as much as 16 basis points, the biggest intraday gain
since Aug. 2. The 5.5 percent bond due September 2022 fell 0.83,
or 8.30 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,278) face amount, to 103.09.  Italian Notes  The nation’s notes also slid as a report showed the economy
contracted more than initially reported in the second quarter,
indicating  Italy ’s fourth recession since 2001 is deepening.  Italian gross domestic product contracted 0.8 percent from
the previous three months, more than the 0.7 percent first
reported by the National Statistics Institute. The two-year
yield climbed five basis points to 2.29 percent, after surging
as much as 19 basis points.  Spanish two-year notes fell for the first day in three,
pushing the yield up 16 basis points to 2.89 percent.  The euro declined 0.2 percent to $1.2786, snapping a three-
day advance, before Samaras meets officials from  Greece ’s
creditors in Athens. Attempts to negotiate 11.5 billion euros of
spending cuts stalled yesterday.  Draghi’s bond-purchase plan is geared toward regaining
control of  interest rates  in the euro area and fighting
speculation of a currency breakup. To trigger ECB purchases,
governments in countries such as Spain and Italy need to request
aid from Europe’s rescue fund and sign up to conditions.  Buying Recommendation  Germany’s 10-year yield rose three basis points to 1.55
percent, after rising to 1.63 percent on Sept. 7, the highest
since June 29. The rate gained 19 basis points last week. It
dropped to match its record-low 1.127 percent on July 23.  BNP Paribas SA (BNP)  recommends buying core European government
bonds when 10-year bund yields are above 1.5 percent, according
to a report by strategists including Paris-based  Patrick Jacq .  “The fundamental context remains dovish,” the report
said, citing weak growth prospects and the outlook for Federal
Reserve action.  Portugal ’s 10-year bonds declined, pushing the yield on the
securities up 24 basis points to 8.34 percent. The two-year note
yield climbed 15 basis points to 4.29 percent, after jumping as
much as 111 basis points.  Volatility on Finland’s bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by Belgium and Italy, according to
measures of 10-year debt, the spread between two-year and 10-
year securities and credit-default swaps. Finland’s 10-year
yield rose five basis points to 1.66 percent.  German bonds returned 2.8 percent this year through Sept.
7, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish securities
advanced 1.8 percent and Italy’s debt earned 15 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
