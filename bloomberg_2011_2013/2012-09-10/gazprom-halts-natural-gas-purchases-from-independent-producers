OAO Gazprom,  Russia ’s natural-gas
export monopoly, suspended purchases of the fuel from
independent producers for an indefinite period because of
unstable domestic demand.  The move doesn’t affect gas supplies that Gazprom
transports from producers to their direct customers or that
other units in the Gazprom group buy, the Moscow-based company
said today by e-mail.  Gazprom said it halted purchases given unstable domestic
demand and has notified independent producers. That group
includes  oil companies  and OAO Novatek, the country’s second-
biggest gas producer.  Gazprom didn’t give the volumes affected. The Vedomosti
newspaper said the halt affects 42 million cubic meters a day
from Novatek, 27 million cubic meters a day from OAO Lukoil and
8.6 million cubic meters a day from Sibneftegas, a unit of
Itera.  Novatek has received notification, Mikhail Lozovoy, a
company spokesman, said by phone. The company isn’t commenting
further until talks with Gazprom are completed, he said.  TNK-BP declined to comment. OAO Rosneft and OAO Lukoil
press officials didn’t immediately answer when called by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
