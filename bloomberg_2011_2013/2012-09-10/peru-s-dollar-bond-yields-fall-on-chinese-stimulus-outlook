Peru ’s dollar-denominated bonds
rose, pushing down yields for the first time in a week, on
speculation policy makers in China will take steps to bolster
economic growth, boosting the outlook for the Andean nation’s
copper exports.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 6.55 percent dollar-
denominated bond due March 2037 fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 3.81 percent at 11:52 a.m. in  Lima ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.34
cent to 143.34 cents per dollar.  Copper rose to a four-month high after reports showed
China’s imports fell in August and industrial output rose the
least in three years, signaling more stimulus may be needed
after the government last week said it approved subway and road
projects across the nation. China is the largest market for
Peru’s copper exports.  “The Chinese data continues to be increasingly negative,”
said  Enrique Alvarez , the head of Latin America fixed-income
research at IdeaGlobal in New York. The outlook for additional
Chinese stimulus “is leading to slightly upped expectations for
consumption and demand for primary metals. That feeds through
positively into Peru.”  The sol was little changed at 2.6085 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.6080 on Sept. 7, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
