Mainstream Renewable Power Ltd.
signed a 60 million-euro ($77 million) loan agreement with
 Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG)  as the Irish clean energy company develops
offshore wind farms and makes plans to expand overseas.  Mainstream will get 40 million euros of the Macquarie
mezzanine debt facility initially, with the balance to be paid
later subject to conditions, Mainstream said in an e-mailed
statement. The Dublin-based company also received 16.8 million
euros from unspecified individuals and plans to raise more
equity, according to the statement.  “We believe Mainstream is uniquely positioned to benefit
from the development of the offshore wind sector, which will
play an increasingly important part in the generation mix over
the next decade,” David Fass, chief executive officer for
Europe, the  Middle East  and Africa at the Sydney-based bank,
said in yesterday’s statement.  Mainstream submitted an application in July to build a 450-
megawatt wind farm off Scotland and is developing two sea-based
projects in the U.K. and Germany. The company is about to start
work at a 138-megawatt wind farm and two 50-megawatt solar
projects in  South Africa , the Negrete Cuel wind farm in Chile
and a park in  Canada .  Mainstream will also use funds for its  Energy Bridge 
project to export wind from Ireland to the U.K. from 2017,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
