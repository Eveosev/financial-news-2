President  Barack Obama ’s campaign
raised $114 million in August, more than the $111.6 million
collected by challenger  Mitt Romney , the rivals said today.  The totals include money raised by their campaigns as well
as by joint fundraising efforts with their respective national
political parties. It was the first time in four months that
Obama’s fundraising efforts had surpassed Romney’s.  “The key to fighting back against the special interests
writing limitless checks to support Mitt Romney is growing our
donor base, and we did substantially in the month of August,”
Obama campaign manager  Jim Messina  said in a statement. “Fueled
by contributions from more than 1.1 million Americans donating
an average of $58 -- more than 317,000 who had never contributed
to the campaign before --we raised a total of more than $114
million.”  Romney’s campaign said that it, along with the Republican
National Committee and state party participants in its
presidential effort, had about $168.5 million cash on hand.
Obama’s campaign didn’t release a cash-on-hand figure.  “Americans are not better off than they were four years
ago and they are looking for a change of leadership,” Romney’s
national finance chairman,  Spencer Zwick , said in a statement.
“We will continue the hard work of raising the resources so
that Mitt Romney and  Paul Ryan  can win in November, put in place
their plan for a stronger middle class, and finally get the
country back on the right track.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
