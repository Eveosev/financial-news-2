Asia ’s naphtha crack spread
widened, extending last week’s gain. PetroChina Co. sold ultra-
low-sulfur diesel in Singapore, the region’s biggest oil-trading
center.  Light Distillates  China International United Petroleum & Chemical Co., or
Unipec, bought two 50,000-barrel cargoes of 92-RON gasoline,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of traders who monitored
transactions on the Platts window. Mercuria Energy Ltd. sold one
shipment for Oct. 6 to Oct. 10 loading at $123.50 a barrel and
Gunvor sold the other for Sept. 25 to Sept. 29 at $124.10.  Total SA sold a similar-sized cargo of 92-RON gasoline
loading Sept. 25 to Sept. 29 to PetroChina at $124.60 a barrel,
the survey showed. Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought the same
quantity of 95-RON grade for Oct. 2 to Oct. 6 from Trafigura
Beheer BV at $127.60.  The premium of Japan  naphtha  to London-traded Brent crude
futures rose $1.70, or 1.5 percent, to $115.19 a metric ton at
5:10 p.m.  Singapore  time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. This crack spread, a measure of the profit from
making the gasoline and petrochemical feedstock, widened 4.8
percent last week.  Middle Distillates  PetroChina sold 150,000 barrels of  gasoil , or diesel, with
10 parts-per-million of sulfur to BP Plc for Sept. 25 to Sept.
29, the earliest loading period, according to the Bloomberg
survey. The cargo of ultra-low-sulfur diesel changed hands at $4
a barrel over prices for Sept. 25 to Oct. 1.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude dropped 24
cents to $18.67 a barrel at 1:53 p.m. Singapore time, according
to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This  crack
spread , a gauge of processing profit, narrowed for the sixth
time in seven days.  Jet fuel ’s premium to gasoil climbed 5 cents to $1.80 a
barrel, PVM said. That’s the highest  regrade  since Nov. 10,
indicating it’s more profitable to make  aviation fuel  over
diesel.  Fuel Oil  High-sulfur  fuel oil ’s  discount  to Dubai crude widened 10
cents to $3.29 a barrel at 1:53 p.m. Singapore time, according
to PVM. The gap widened for a second day, signaling increased
losses for refiners turning crude into residual fuels.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade, or the  viscosity spread , was unchanged for a second day
at $13.75 a ton, PVM data showed. This means bunker, or marine
fuel, moved in tandem with supplies used in power stations.  Refinery News  Idemitsu Kosan Co. shut the 623,000 ton-a-year ethylene
plant at its Tokuyama refinery for maintenance on Sept. 4, said
a company official who asked not to be identified because of
internal policy.  Tenders  Cargill Inc., Marubeni Corp. and Unipec bought a total of
145,000 tons of naphtha from three Indian refiners for loading
in September and October, according to traders who asked not to
be named because the information is confidential.  To contact the reporters on this story:
