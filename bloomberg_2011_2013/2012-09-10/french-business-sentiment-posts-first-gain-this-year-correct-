(Corrects last increase in first and second paragraphs.)  Sentiment among French factory
executives climbed for the first time in nine months, the
Bank of France said.  Confidence climbed to 93 in August from 90 in July, the
Bank of France said in a monthly survey sent by e-mail. The
increase, together with improved service-industry sentiment,
suggests the French economy will shrink 0.1 percent in the third
quarter, the bank said. It was the first gain since November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
