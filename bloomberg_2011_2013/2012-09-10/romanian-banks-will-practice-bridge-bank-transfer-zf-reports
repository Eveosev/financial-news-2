Romania ’s commercial banks will
practice a procedure to transfer potential ailing assets in a
“bridge bank,”  Ziarul Financiar  reported today, citing Nicolae Cinteza, who heads the central bank’s supervision unit.  The central bank, which already completed the first
exercise with a bank, is seeking to update the bridge-bank
legislation approved by the government earlier this year to
include the findings of the exercise after testing all the
banks, the Bucharest-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
