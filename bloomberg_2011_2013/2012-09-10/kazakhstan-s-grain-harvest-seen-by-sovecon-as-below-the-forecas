Kazakhstan  may harvest less than
the 13 million metric tons of grains forecast by the Kazakh
government this year, the Moscow-based researcher  SovEcon  said
on its website today.  Kazakh farmers harvested 8.7 million tons of grain from
nearly 70 percent of the area sown as of today, and average
yield reached 0.8 ton a hectare (2.47 acres), SovEcon said,
citing Kazakhstan’s Agriculture Ministry data.  Kazakhstan forecast the harvest at about 13 million tons
for 2012-13, down from a record 26 million tons last year,
SovEcon said. “This forecast becomes less real as the
harvesting continues and approaches its end,” SovEcon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
