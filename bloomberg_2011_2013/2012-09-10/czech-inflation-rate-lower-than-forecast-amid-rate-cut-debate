Czech inflation was slower than the
central bank’s forecast in August, adding to arguments for
cutting  interest rates  as policy makers debate whether to
respond to a recession with looser monetary conditions.  The  inflation  rate was 3.3 percent from a year ago, up from
3.1 percent in July, the Statistics Office said on its website
today. The reading was below the 3.4 percent estimate by the
central bank and matched the 3.3 percent median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey of 17 economists. Prices fell 0.1 percent from
the previous month.  The Czech  economy  is suffering from weak domestic demand
after the government cut investments and raised sales taxes to
trim the  budget deficit . While a foreign  trade surplus  remains,
the euro-area’s debt crisis has curbed purchases of electronics
and cars. The 27-nation European Union buys 80 percent of Czech
exports including from companies such as carmaker Skoda Auto AS.  Policy makers were split at their  last meeting  on Aug. 2 in
assessing the effect of tax increases on inflation and risks
stemming from the debt crisis. Two setters sought a quarter-
point reduction after the bank cut its two-week  benchmark  to a
record-low 0.5 percent in June, while four voted for no change
even as the bank’s forecast saw lower rates amid a worsening
economic outlook.  The biggest contribution to the increase in the inflation
rate came from food costs and housing, water, energy and fuels,
the statistics office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
