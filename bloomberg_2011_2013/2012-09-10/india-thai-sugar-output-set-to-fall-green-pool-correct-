Sugar production in  India  and
Thailand in the 2012-2013 crop year will probably be less than
expected because of dry weather, according to Green Pool
Commodity Specialists Pty.  Indiaâ€™s sugar production may decline to 24.2 million metric
tons, compared with 25.5 million estimated earlier, Tom McNeill,
a director at Green Pool, said by phone today. Thai output may
drop to 10 million tons from 10.2 million tons forecast earlier,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
