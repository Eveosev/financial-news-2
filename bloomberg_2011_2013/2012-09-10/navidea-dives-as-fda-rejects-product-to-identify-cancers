Navidea Biopharmaceuticals Inc. (NAVB) 
plummeted as much as 36 percent after regulators rejected the
company’s product designed to help identify lymph nodes that
have the highest probability of being cancerous.  Navidea declined to $2.23 in extended trading at 4:25 p.m.
New York time after closing at $3.51. The company’s shares rose
19 percent in the past 12 months.  The failure to approve Lymphoseek, Navidea’s
radiopharmaceutical, is related to third-party contract
manufacturers, not the safety or efficacy data filed with the
 Food and Drug Administration , the Dublin, Ohio-based company
said today in a statement. Lymphoseek, an injectable chemical,
has been studied in mapping procedures performed on  breast
cancer  and melanoma patients.  “We are already working closely with the FDA and our
third-party contract manufacturers to address all requirements
to support the shortest possible” application “resubmission
and review,” Mark Pykett, president and chief executive officer
of Navidea, said in the statement. “We remain confident that
our clinical data clearly demonstrate the value of Lymphoseek.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
