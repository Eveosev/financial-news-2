A measure of job prospects in the
U.S. rose in August for a second month as more positions opened
up.  The Conference Board’s Employment Trends Index increased
0.5 percent to 108.59, the highest since July 2008, from the
prior month’s revised reading of 108.04, the New York-based
private research group said today. The measure rose 6.2 percent
from August 2011.  “Slow job growth will continue in the short term,”  Gad Levanon , director of macroeconomic research at the Conference
Board, said today in a statement. “In such an environment, it’s
difficult to foresee the economy adding much more than 100,000
jobs per month.”  The report follows Labor Department data last week that
showed employers added fewer workers than forecast in August,
while the  unemployment rate  fell as more people left the  labor
force . Weaker hiring and persistent joblessness help explain why
Federal Reserve policy makers meeting this week may opt for
additional easing to boost the economy.  Payrolls rose by 96,000 workers in August after a revised
141,000 increase in July that was smaller than initially
estimated, the Labor Department said on Sept. 7. The median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey called for a
130,000 advance.  The jobless rate unexpectedly dropped to 8.1 percent from
8.3 percent, the Labor Department report also showed last week.
Unemployment has been stuck above 8 percent since February 2009,
the longest stretch in monthly records going back to 1948.  Hiring Trends  The Employment Trends Index aggregates eight labor-market
indicators to forecast short-term hiring trends. On average, it
can signal a rebound in hiring as little as three months before
the fact and can predict job declines six to nine months in
advance, the Conference Board said.  Improvements in four of the index’s eight components
contributed to the rise in the overall gauge, today’s report
showed. These included more  job openings , a larger share of
firms with positions they’re not able to fill right now, and a
drop in the number of consumers saying jobs were hard to get.  Faster hiring is needed to spur  consumer spending , which
accounts for about 70 percent of the economy. The U.S. has
managed to recover 4.1 million of the 8.8 million jobs lost as a
result of the 18-month recession that ended in June 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
