(Corrects month in first paragraph.)  Swedish industrial production fell
for the fifth month in six in July as exports suffer from
slowing European demand and a surging krona.  Production fell an annual 0.4 percent, Stockholm-based
 Statistics Sweden  said today. It was  estimated  to fall 2.1
percent, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey
of six economists. Output rose a  monthly  0.3 percent, compared
with a predicted 0.3 percent contraction.  Sweden’s central bank last week cut its main lending rate
for a third time since December to 1.25 percent, saying that
that “weak demand from the euro area will now damp exports”
and citing the strong currency.  The krona last month hit a 12-year high against the euro as
investors fled the common currency amid a deepening debt crisis.
Swedish business and unions have pushed for the bank to cut
rates, in part to weaken the currency.  Sweden  gets about half
its economic output from sales abroad, of which some 70 percent
go to  Europe .  Industrial orders fell an  annual  5.4 percent and decreased
a  monthly  0.7 percent in July, Statistics Sweden said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
