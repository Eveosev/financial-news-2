Latvian consumer prices rose 1.7
percent from a year earlier in August, matching Julyâ€™s 21-month
low, as food and transport costs advanced.  Prices fell 0.3 percent from the previous month, the
 statistics office , based in the capital, Riga, said today on its
website. The annual rate was less than the 1.9 percent median
estimate of six economists in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
