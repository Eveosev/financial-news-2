U.S. solar-panel installations more
than doubled in the second quarter from a year earlier led by
demand in  California , according to the  Solar Energy Industries
Association .  Installations totaled 742 megawatts in the quarter, up 45
percent since the first quarter, and may reach 3.2 gigawatts by
year end, the Washington-based trade group said today in its
quarterly market report. California led installations with 217
megawatts, followed by  Arizona  with 173 megawatts.  The U.S. now has 5.7 gigawatts of installed solar capacity,
enough to power 1 million homes, according to GTM Research, a
Boston-based consulting company that prepared the report with
SEIA.  The boom was driven by large projects that sell power to
utilities, with little growth in residential installations and
declines in non-residential projects, Shayle Kann, vice
president at GTM, said in an interview Sept. 7. “It’s an
indicator that the utility market will be the main story this
year and probably for the next few years.”  More panels were installed in the quarter than in all of
2009 as solar costs declined, Rhone Resch, chief executive
officer of SEIA, said in the statement. “With costs continuing
to come down, solar is affordable today for more homes,
businesses, utilities, and the military.”  The U.S. now has 3.4 gigawatts of projects under
construction and about 10 gigawatts more of projects that have
signed power contracts, said Kann. It will be the fourth largest
market for panel installations this year, led by Germany, Italy
and  China .  To contact the reporter on this story:
