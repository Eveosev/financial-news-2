New York City MayorMichael Bloomberg said there are plans to build two new science and
medical facilities on Manhattan’s Upper East Side.  The plans include an agreement to sell a 66,000-square­foot

Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center will construct an up to
750,000-square-foot cancer care facility that will allow for the
development of innovative outpatient treatment programs.  Additionally,  City University  of New York’s  Hunter College 
will build an up to 336,000-square-foot science and health
professions building to upgrade its science and nursing
