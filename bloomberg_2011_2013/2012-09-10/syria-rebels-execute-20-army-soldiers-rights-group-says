Syrian rebels in the city of Aleppo
have killed 20 army soldiers execution-style, the Observatory
for  Human Rights  in  Syria  said in an e-mailed statement.  An amateur video of the incident, posted on YouTube, showed
dead soldiers in military uniforms, handcuffed and blindfolded
laying on a sidewalk and surrounded by armed men shouting “God
is Great” and “these are the dogs of Assad.” Another voice
can be heard identifying the location as the Hanano area in
Aleppo.  Activists told  Al Jazeera  television that the dead soldiers
were defectors and were killed by forces loyal to President
Bashar al-Assad. The authenticity of the video couldn’t be
verified.  In response to the video, Colonel Abdel Jabbar al-Ageidi,
head of the rebels’ military council in Aleppo and its suburbs
told Al Jazeera, “We totally condemn such action.” He said he
didn’t know the soldiers were killed by rebels or the Army.  To contact the reporter on this story:
