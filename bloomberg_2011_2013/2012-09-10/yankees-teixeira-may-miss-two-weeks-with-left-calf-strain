New York  Yankees first baseman  Mark Teixeira  may miss at least half of the team’s remaining 22
regular-season games because of a strained left calf.  Teixeira, whose 81 runs batted in are second on the Yankees,
underwent a scan yesterday that revealed the irritation. The
American League East division-leading Yankees said he’ll miss 10
to 14 days, leaving them without one of their top offensive
players as they seek a playoff berth.  The Yankees open a three-game series today in Boston before
hosting the Tampa Bay Rays in three games on Sept. 14-16 and
visiting the  Toronto Blue Jays  from Sept. 18-20.  Teixeira, 32, reinjured his calf during the Yankees’ 5-4
loss to the Baltimore Orioles on Sept. 8 when he slid headfirst
into first base trying to prevent a game-ending double play.
He’s hitting .255 with 23 home runs this season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
