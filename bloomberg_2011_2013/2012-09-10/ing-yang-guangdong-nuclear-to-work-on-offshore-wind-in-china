China Ming Yang Wind Power Group
Ltd. (MY)  signed an agreement with China Guangdong Nuclear Power
Holding Corp. to develop offshore wind as the nation’s third-
largest turbine maker seeks to boost installations at home.  Ming Yang and Shenzhen-based Guangdong Nuclear will work
together on the Golden Bay offshore wind project in Jieyang,
 Guangdong province , and develop wind on land and at sea in the
 Fujian province , according to a statement on Ming Yang’s
website. The companies will also seek overseas “market
opportunities,” according to the statement.  Chinese turbine manufacturers including Sinovel Wind Group
Co. and Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co. are seeking
to boost offshore wind operations in a market that’s dominated
by European companies such as Vestas Wind Systems A/S and
Siemens AG.  China , where onshore wind growth is slowing, has a
goal to build 30 gigawatts of offshore capacity by 2020 from
about 200 megawatts now.  “The collaboration with CGNPC is strategically important
for us to establish our leading position in offshore wind power
development in China,” Chuanwei Zhang, chief executive officer
of Guangdong-based Ming Yang, said in the statement. Ming Yang
and Guangdong Nuclear will also set up a renewable energy fund
and research improving utilization of wind and solar power,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
