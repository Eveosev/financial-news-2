U.K. banks  retained a negative
outlook from Moody’s Investors Service because of the recession,
loans that may require further writedowns and higher regulatory
costs.  Stricter consumer protection following banks’ mis-selling
of loan insurance, Basel III capital rules and proposals to
build firebreaks around retail banks will also harm
profitability, Moody’s said today in a statement.  “The continued negative outlook for the U.K. banking
sector is driven by the U.K.’s uncertain economic prospects,
pressure on profitability and downside risk for asset quality,”
Elisabeth Rudman, a Moody’s senior vice president said in the
statement.  So-called recovery and resolution frameworks, which seek to
allow the orderly failure of banks during a financial crisis,
will reduce the need of state-support for banks including  HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,  Barclays Plc (BARC) ,  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  and  Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc  over the next 12 to 18 months,
Moody’s said.  Moody’s in October cut the senior debt and deposit ratings
of 12 British lenders including RBS and Lloyds, saying the
government would be less likely to provide support in the event
of failure.  -- Editors: Jon Menon, Steve Bailey  To contact the reporter on this story:
