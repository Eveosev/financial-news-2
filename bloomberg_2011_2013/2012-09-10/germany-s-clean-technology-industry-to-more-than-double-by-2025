Germany ’s clean-technologies
industry is set to more than double in volume by 2025, creating
jobs and maintaining its global market share, a study shows.  The volume of German companies in areas such as resource
efficiency, sustainable transport and recycling will rise 125
percent to 674 billion euros ($862 billion), Roland Berger
Strategy Consultants said. They’ll keep a market share of about
15 percent while creating an expected 1 million jobs, it said.  “Green technologies are growth technologies,” Environment
Minister Peter Altmaier, who commissioned the study, said today
in Berlin. “We still have a leading position in clean
technologies and we will do everything to defend that.”  Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, plans to increase its
reliance on renewable sources of power such as solar and wind as
it phases out nuclear generation. Domestic technology companies
such as  Solarworld AG (SWV)  must contend with rising competition from
 Asia , where investment in clean energy has soared.  The German clean-tech industry is dominated by small- and
medium-sized businesses that have helped stabilize the nation’s
economy, Altmaier said. The country has a target to raise  energy
efficiency  and lower greenhouse-gas emissions 40 percent by 2020
from 1990 levels.  The global clean-tech market will more than double to 4.4
trillion euros by 2025, according to the Roland Berger study.  To contact the reporter on this story:
