Taiwan ’s dollar strengthened the
most in more than four months after a report last week showed
U.S. jobs growth slowed, boosting speculation the  Federal
Reserve  will embark on a third round of bond-buying.  The Dollar Index was near a four-month low after a Sept. 7
report showed U.S. payrolls increased 96,000 in August, less
than the 130,000 gain forecast in a Bloomberg survey. Taiwan’s
exports slumped 4.2 percent in August from a year earlier, a
sixth month of decline, official data showed the same day.  “Asian currencies have been pretty strong recently due to
all the speculation about more quantitative easing,” said
Samson Tu, a Taipei-based  fund manager  at Uni-President Assets
Management Corp., who helps manage $1.6 billion of fixed-income
assets. “As the Taiwan economy is still in pretty bad shape,
the central bank might try to keep the currency stable.
Appreciation for the  Taiwan dollar  should be limited.”  The currency advanced 0.3 percent to NT$29.740 against its
U.S. counterpart, the biggest increase since April 30, according
to Taipei Forex Inc. It reached NT$29.670 earlier, the strongest
level since May 31.  Global funds bought $52 million more Taiwanese stocks than
they sold today, boosting net purchases for the year to $577
million, according to stock exchange data.  One-month implied volatility in the currency, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, climbed six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 3.6 percent. The Taiwan
dollar’s one-month non-deliverable forwards climbed 0.1 percent
to NT$29.647 per dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Government bonds  were steady. The yield on Taiwan’s 1.125
percent notes due September 2022 was at 1.174 percent, according
to Gretai Securities Market.  The  overnight money-market rate  held at 0.39 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
