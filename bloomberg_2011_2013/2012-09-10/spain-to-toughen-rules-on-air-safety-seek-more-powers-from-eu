Spain  will tighten regulations to
improve the safety of  air travel  in the country and reinforce
powers to punish airlines that infringe them, the  Development
Ministry  said.  The government will require foreign companies that operate
a high volume of flights in Spain to notify the authorities of
incidents affecting air safety, the ministry said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Spain will also seek greater powers from the European
Commission to supervise foreign companies with extensive
operations in the country. In addition, the government will
establish a new procedure in airports for dealing with aircraft
that suffer emergency fuel shortages, the ministry said.  The government said last month Spainâ€™s aviation safety
agency was investigating three emergency landings by  Ryanair
Holdings Plc (RYA)  planes at Valencia airport. Ryanair said at the
time it would cooperate fully with the investigation and that
its aircraft landed with reserve fuel for least 30 minutes
flying time, in full compliance with European Aviation Safety
Agency requirements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
