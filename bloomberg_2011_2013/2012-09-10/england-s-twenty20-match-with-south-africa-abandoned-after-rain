England’s second Twenty20 cricket
match with  South Africa  was abandoned because of persistent
rain, denying the home team the chance to even the series.  Chasing 78 runs to win at Old Trafford in Manchester last
night, England reached 29-2 after 4.1 overs before rain ended a
contest reduced to nine overs per team.  Hashim Amla earlier hit an unbeaten 47 off 30 balls to lead
the touring team to 77-5.  Steven Finn  took 2-17 for England,
including the wicket of Richard Levi with the first ball.  South Africa won the series opener by seven wickets. The
final match is scheduled for tomorrow at Edgbaston, Birmingham.  After that match, both teams will travel to  Sri Lanka  for
the World Twenty20 tournament, which starts Sept. 18. England is
the defending world champion in the sport’s shortest format.  Australia routed Pakistan by 94 runs last night in the
final match of their series in Dubai.  Chasing a 169-run target, Pakistan was all out for 74 --
the  joint-lowest score  by an elite Test-playing nation in
Twenty20 internationals -- for its biggest defeat in the format.  Pakistan  won the first match by seven wickets and the
second in a super-over to secure the series victory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
