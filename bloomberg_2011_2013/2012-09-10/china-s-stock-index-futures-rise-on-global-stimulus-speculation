China ’s stocks rose to the highest
level in almost a month on speculation the government will take
steps to boost economic growth after trade data missed estimates
and industrial output grew at the slowest pace in three years.  Sany Heavy Industry Co. (600031)  and Anhui Conch Cement Co. rallied
among construction-related stocks after President  Hu Jintao 
urged governments in  Asia  to speed up infrastructure
development. Jiangxi Copper Co. surged to the highest level in
almost two months on higher prices of the metal. China Cosco
Holdings Co., the world’s largest operator of dry-bulk ships,
slid the most in a week on concern trade flows will slow.  “Data still show the economy hasn’t rebounded from the
bottom,” said Wu Kan, Shanghai-based  fund manager  at Dazhong
Insurance Co., which oversees $285 million. “Policy easing will
continue but it will likely be at a moderate pace.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  added 0.3 percent to 2,134.89
at the close, the highest since Aug. 14. The measure extended a
3.7 percent jump on Sept. 7 that was the biggest gain in eight
months. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  rose 0.4 percent to 2,326.67. The  Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies traded in  Hong
Kong  fell 0.2 percent. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the
measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, added
1.2 percent in  New York  on Sept. 7.  Deeper Slowdown  The Shanghai Composite advanced 3.9 percent last week, the
most since October, after China’s top planning body approved
investment projects targeting roads and sewage treatment. Still,
the measure has dropped 2.9 percent this year on concern China’s
slowdown is deepening. The index is valued at 9.8 times
estimated earnings, compared with the 17.4 average since
Bloomberg began compiling the weekly  data  in 2006.  Gauges of material and industrial stocks in the CSI 300
advanced 1.5 percent and 1 percent today respectively, the two
biggest gainers among the 10 industry groups.  Jiangxi Copper, the country’s biggest producer of the
metal, rose 2.6 percent to 22.36  yuan , the highest close since
July 20.  Tongling Nonferrous Metals Group Co. (000630) , the second
largest, climbed 6.2 percent to 19.10 yuan. Three-month copper
added as much as 0.6 percent to $8,019 a metric ton on the
London Metal Exchange, the highest price since May 14, on
expectations global policy makers will move to bolster growth.  Sany Heavy, the biggest Chinese machinery maker, surged 2.9
percent to 10.22 yuan, adding to a 10 percent jump on Sept. 7
after the nation’s top planning body approved new roads,
railways and urban infrastructure that Nomura Holdings Inc.
estimates have a combined value of about 1 trillion yuan ($157.8
billion).  Infrastructure Investment  Anhui Conch, China’s biggest cement maker, advanced 2.6
percent to 15.46 yuan, the highest close since June 21.  Gansu
Qilianshan Cement Group Co. (600720)  surged 10 percent to 11.62 yuan, the
biggest advance since Nov. 17, 2008.  Chinese infrastructure projects will provide a “credit
positive” stimulus for steelmakers, cement and construction
materials companies, and railway and subway equipment makers,
Moody’s Investors Service said in a report today.  President Hu said infrastructure development is key to
promoting recovery and achieving sustained and stable growth
amid increasing downward risks to the global economy. China’s
small and medium-sized enterprises are having a “hard time”
and exporters are facing more difficulties, he said to business
executives at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in
Vladivostok on Sept. 8.  August Data  Industrial production increased 8.9 percent in August from
a year earlier and fixed-asset investment growth in the first
eight months eased to a lower-than-estimated 20.2 percent, the
 National Bureau of Statistics  said yesterday in Beijing.  The decline in producer prices extended into a sixth month,
with a drop of 3.5 percent, according to the bureau. Inflation
quickened to 2 percent in August, accelerating for the first
time in five months. Retail sales rose 13.2 percent from a year
earlier in August, in line with the median economist estimate.  Exports gained 2.7 percent in August from a year earlier,
China’s customs administration said today in Beijing. That
compares with the median forecast of 2.9 percent growth in a
Bloomberg News survey of 36 economists. Imports fell 2.6
percent, compared with the survey’s prediction for an increase
of 3.5 percent.  Policy Easing  China Cosco lost 1.9 percent to 4.09 yuan.  China Shipping
Development Co. (600026) , a unit of China’s second-biggest sea-cargo
group, fell 0.9 percent to 4.48 yuan. China Shipping Container
Lines Co., the country’s second-largest carrier of sea-cargo
boxes, lost 1.8 percent to 2.19 yuan.  China’s  central bank  has held off from monetary policy
loosening since July 5 when it cut  interest rates  for the second
time in less than a month. It lowered  reserve requirements  three
times between November and May by 50 basis points each time.  The nation’s money-market rate dropped, extending a three-
week slide, on speculation the central bank will make more funds
available for lending. The monetary authority may announce a
reserve-ratio cut this week, according to a Daiwa Capital
Markets report.  Thirty-day  volatility  in the Shanghai Composite jumped to
16 today, compared with this year’s average of 17. About 13.9
billion shares changed hands in the gauge on Sept. 7, 78 percent
higher than the daily average this year.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., rose 2.8 percent on Sept. 7,
the biggest intraday advance since June 29, as Chinese
infrastructure projects announced last week sparked speculation
of further stimulus to boost growth.  Hao Hong, Bocom International Holdings Co.’s managing
director for research, cited the infrastructure spending as a
catalyst for Chinese equities. The government is likely to
introduce more policies to bolster economic growth, Hong Kong-
based Hong wrote in an e-mail on Sept. 7.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
