Tropical Storm Leslie may regain
hurricane strength after battering  Bermuda  with high winds over
the weekend as it heads for the eastern end of Newfoundland, the
National Hurricane Center said.  The 12th named weather system of the Atlantic season was
about 315 miles (505 kilometers) northeast of Bermuda with 60
miles per hour winds, moving northward at 16 mph, the Miami-
based center said in a 5 a.m. Atlantic time  advisory . A
 hurricane watch  is in effect for Stones Cove to Charlottetown,
Newfoundland, the NHC said.  The eye of the storm is expected to move over southeastern
Newfoundland tomorrow morning, when it may be at hurricane
strength of at least 74 mph again, the center said. Leslie is
forecast to begin transforming to an extratropical or frontal
cyclone as it approaches the Canadian Maritimes, it said.  A tropical storm warning is in effect for Newfoundland from
Indian Harbour to Stones Cove and Fogo Island to Charlottetown.
Tropical storm-force winds extend outward as much as 205 miles
from the center, the NHC said.  Leslie’s track after Newfoundland may take the system near
southern Greenland in two days and possibly to southwestern
Iceland early on Sept. 13, NHC’s forecast map showed.  Hurricane Michael was about 1,065 miles west of the Azores
meanwhile packing 80 mph winds as it moved west at 7 mph, the
NHC said in a separate  advisory . The system is forecast to
weaken to a tropical storm and is no threat to land.  The Atlantic storm season runs though the end of November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
