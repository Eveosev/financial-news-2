Wheb Group, a London-based
investment manager, and Hermes GPE LLP bought a majority stake
in Wireless Energy Management Systems International Ltd., a U.K.
provider of systems that control energy use in buildings.  Wheb, through its Wheb Partners unit, and London-based
private equity company Hermes GPE also put new “growth
capital” into the Stockport-based company as part of the 13
million-pound ($21 million) financing, Wheb said in an e-mailed
statement.  Wireless Energy Management, or WEMS, with customers
including  BT Group Plc (BT/A)  and Alliance Boots Holdings Ltd., makes
computer-controlled systems that operate and control heating,
air conditioning and lighting in buildings. The systems have no
wires curbing installation costs and can help businesses with
small commercial buildings such as retail and telecommunications
make annual energy savings of as much as 30 percent, according
to the statement.  Wheb Partners invests in resource-efficiency companies and
manages two private equity funds with total assets under
management of 130 million pounds, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
