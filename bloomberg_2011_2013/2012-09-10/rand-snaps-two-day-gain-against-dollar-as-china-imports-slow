The rand snapped two days of gains
against the dollar after Chinese imports unexpectedly fell,
adding to signs of slowing global growth and cutting appetite
for riskier emerging-market assets.  South Africa ’s currency depreciated as much as 0.6 percent
before weakening 0.1 percent to 8.1808 a dollar as of 3:41 p.m.
in Johannesburg. Yields on the nation’s 6.75 percent bonds due
2021 declined one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.59
percent.  Imports by  China , the biggest buyer of South African raw
materials, slid 2.6 percent in August from a year earlier. That
compares with a median analyst estimate of a 3.5 percent rise.
Gold fell for the first time in three sessions in  New York  as
the dollar rose on  Greece ’s struggles to qualify for aid
payments.  “We started off pretty poorly with this morning’s Chinese
trade figures confirming expectations of weakness in the
economy,”  John Cairns  and Josina Solomons, strategists at Rand
Merchant Bank in Johannesburg, said in an e-mailed note today.  South Africa’s inclusion next month in Citigroup’s World
Government Bond Index is luring money managers overseeing more
than $2 trillion who use the gauge to measure their performance.  Foreign investors bought a net 5.8 billion rand ($708
million) of South African bonds last week, according to JSE Ltd.
data. Foreigners have bought 74 billion rand of the nation’s
debt this year, more than in any other year since Bloomberg
started compiling the data in 1996.  To contact the reporter on this story:
