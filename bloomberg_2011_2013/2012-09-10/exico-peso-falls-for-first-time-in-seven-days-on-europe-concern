Mexico ’s peso slid for the first
time in seven days as  Greece  struggled to qualify for aid,
damping demand for the Latin American country’s assets.  The peso depreciated 0.8 percent to 13.0844 per dollar at 4
p.m. in Mexico City, the first decline since Aug. 30. The
currency touched 12.9478 on Sept. 7, the strongest level since
May 3. It has rallied 6.5 percent against the dollar this year,
the biggest gain against the greenback’s 16 most-traded
counterparts.  Concern is mounting over whether a  European Central Bank 
bid to gain control over the region’s three-year-old debt crisis
will succeed after Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras failed
to secure agreement from coalition partners on spending cuts.
 Germany ’s highest court will issue a ruling this week on bids to
halt the country’s participation in the European Stability
Mechanism.  “They need to act,” Roberto Galvan, a currency trader at
Intercam Casa de Bolsa SA, said by phone from Mexico City.
“When one has problems, one has to take strong measures.”  The yield on Mexico’s peso-denominated debt due in 2024
rose four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 5.63
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell
0.40 centavo to 138.66 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
