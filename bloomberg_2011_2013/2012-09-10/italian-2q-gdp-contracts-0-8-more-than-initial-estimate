Italy’s gross domestic product
contracted more than initially reported in the second quarter,
indicating the country’s fourth recession since 2001 is
deepening.  GDP contracted 0.8 percent from the previous three months,
more than the 0.7 percent first reported by the National
Statistics Institute. From a year earlier economic activity
shrank 2.6 percent, more than the 2.5 percent first reported on
Aug. 7, Rome-based Istat said today in its final report on
second-quarter GDP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
