Serbia ’s central bank lifted
mandatory reserve requirements for leasing companies to help
them cut costs and improve their ability to compete.  Freeing leasing firms from allocating to reserves 10
percent of the funding they borrow abroad will allow financial
leasing to become “a more attractive product” the Belgrade-
based Narodna Banka Srbije said in an e-mailed statement.  Thirteen of Serbia’s 16 active leasing companies had a
combined pretax profit of 467.2 million dinars ($51.34 million)
in the first six months, while three had a cumulative loss of
almost 567 million dinars, according to the central bank that
regulates and supervises financial services.  Hypo Alpe-Adria Leasing d.o.o Beograd is Serbia’s biggest
leasing company with almost 25 percent of the market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
