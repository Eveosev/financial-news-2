Ethanol futures plunged to the
lowest price in more than eight weeks in  Chicago  on concern that
the sluggish global economy will stifle demand.  Prices dropped the most since Aug. 13 on speculation that
the  Federal Reserve  this week will announce a third round of
stimulus efforts, or quantitative easing, known as QE3, to boost
the economy and as dry Midwest weather helps farmers get into
fields to collect corn, ethanol’s primary ingredient in the U.S.  “This is kind of the quiet before the storm,” said  Dan Flynn , a trader at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “You have
harvest pressure number one, and traders are waiting to see
whether the Fed announces QE3.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery dropped 3.6 cents,
or 1.4 percent, to $2.476 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the lowest price since July 11. Futures have gained 12
percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast rose 1
cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.665 a gallon, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The biofuel was unchanged in  New York  at $2.605
a gallon, in Chicago at $2.53 and in the U.S. Gulf Coast at
$2.595 a gallon.  Corn for December delivery decreased 16.25 cents, or 2
percent, to $7.8325 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Gasoline for October delivery rose 0.44 cent to $3.024 a
gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest prices
since Aug. 31. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which
is made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  The rise in gasoline stretches its  premium  to ethanol to
54.8 cents, from 50.8 on Sept. 7, making the biofuel more
attractive to blend as refiners stand to pocket the difference
between the two fuels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
