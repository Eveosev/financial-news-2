The  University of Arkansas  dropped
out of the  Associated Press  college football poll following the
Razorbacks’ overtime loss to unranked Louisiana-Monroe.  The team’s fall from the No. 8 spot to outside the top 25-
ranked U.S. college football teams marks the second-biggest drop
in the poll’s history. The University of Michigan dropped from
the No. 5 spot to out of the poll following the Wolverines’
opening-week loss to Appalachian State in 2007.  Alabama remains No. 1 followed by the University of
 Southern California , Louisiana State University and Oregon.
Florida State and Oklahoma are tied for fifth. Georgia,  South
Carolina , West Virginia and Michigan State complete the top 10.  Arkansas, which lost 34-31 to Louisiana-Monroe after losing
quarterback Tyler Wilson to an injury, was one of four schools
to drop out of the weekly ranking along with Nebraska, Wisconsin
and Oklahoma State.  UCLA, at No. 22, and No. 23 Tennessee return to the poll
for the first time in four years, according to the AP. No. 24
Arizona is ranked for the first time since November 2010 and No.
25  Brigham Young University  returned to the poll for the first
time since the final 2009 poll, the AP said.  The Associated Press has run a football poll annually since
1936.  To contact the reporter on this story:
