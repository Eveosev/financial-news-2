Sudanese inflation accelerated to
42.1 percent in August from 41.6 percent in July as food prices
increased, the  Central Bureau of Statistics  said.  Prices of food and drinks, the biggest component in the
 consumer price index , rose 3.9 percent in the month as the cost
of meat, beans and vegetables increased as much as 11.8 percent,
the Khartoum-based agency said today in an e-mailed statement.  Finance Minister Ali Mahmoud Abdel Rasoul said in December
that Sudan was targeting an inflation rate of below 17 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
