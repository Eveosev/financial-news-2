U.K. 10-year gilts fell, pushing
yields toward a 10-week high, before the Debt Management Office
sells inflation-linked and conventional bonds this week and amid
signs the U.K. economy is emerging from recession.  Gilts dropped before the debt office sells 1.25 billion
pounds ($2 billion) of index-linked securities due in 2034
tomorrow and 3.25 billion pounds of 10-year bonds two days
later. Data tomorrow will show the U.K.  trade deficit  shrank in
July, according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists. A
labor market report will show that  unemployment  stayed at the
lowest rate in over a year, according to a separate survey. The
pound rose for the first time in four days against the euro.  Gilts have fallen because “there is plenty of U.K. supply
around this week with the linker tomorrow and the conventional
later in the week,” said  Marc Ostwald , a fixed-income
strategist at Monument Securities Ltd. in  London .  Benchmark 10-year yields rose five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 1.74 percent as of 4:40 p.m. London time.
The rate climbed to 1.804 percent on Sept. 7, the highest level
since June 29. The 1.75 percent bond maturing in September 2022
fell 0.46, or 4.60 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to
100.14.  The U.K. last sold 10-year gilts on July 12 at a  record-low 
auction yield of 1.72 percent. Investors bid for 2.2 times the
amount of securities allotted.  Gilts have returned 3.5 percent this year through Sept. 7,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies, outperforming German
bunds, which gained 2.8 percent, and U.S. Treasuries, which
earned 2.1 percent.  U.K. Data  Reports released last week showed U.K. service activity
expanded more than economists forecast and industrial production
surged the most in 25 years.  Data due tomorrow will show the U.K. trade deficit shrank
to 9 billion pounds in July, from 10.1 billion pounds the month
before, according to the median estimate of 20 analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey. A labor market report the next day will
show the  unemployment rate  stayed at 8 percent, the lowest since
July 2011, according to a separate survey.  The pound appreciated 0.2 percent to 79.92 pence per euro
after declining to 80.11 pence, the weakest level since July 5.
Sterling was little changed at $1.6010, having strengthened to
$1.6034 at the end of last week, the most since May 15.  Risk Reversal  Three-month options show that the premium for puts, which
grant the right to sell the euro versus the pound, over calls,
which confer the right to buy, shrank to the least since July
2011.  The gap between the so-called 25-delta risk reversal rates
reached minus 0.375 percentage points.  Risk reversals measure the difference between implied
volatility, or a gauge of price and demand, on similar puts and
calls. Traders pay a premium for puts when they expect a
currency to decline.  The U.K. currency will end the year at $1.55, according to
the median of 48 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg, down
from a prediction of $1.59 in May. It last traded at $1.55 on
Aug. 2 and has strengthened 4.9 percent from a near five-month
low of $1.5269 on June 1.  The pound has gained 0.6 percent in the past month,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-market currencies. The dollar fell 1.7 percent and
the euro rose 2.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
