Transocean Ltd. (RIG) , the owner of the
oil rig that exploded in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010, sold
$1.5 billion of debt to fund the construction of four
drillships.  The world’s largest offshore oil driller issued equal
portions of $750 million in 2.5 percent, five-year securities to
yield 190 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries and
3.8 percent, 10-year notes at 220 basis points more than
benchmarks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Proceeds
from the transaction may be used to build four vessels with
offshore drilling capabilities, Vernier, Switzerland-based
Transocean said today in a statement distributed by Marketwire.  Transocean’s bonds have recovered after one of its rigs
caused the worst accidental  oil spill  in U.S. history on April
20, 2010, which depressed the price of the company’s debt as
much as 29 percent. Its $1 billion of 6 percent unsecured
debentures due in 2018 traded at 115.3 cents on the dollar to
yield 3 percent Aug. 14, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  If the driller doesn’t build the ships, the proceeds will
be used for general corporate purposes, the company said in the
statement.  Transocean last tapped the corporate bond market in
November, issuing  $2.5 billion  of notes in a three-part
offering, Bloomberg data show.  The debt may be rated Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and
BBB- by  Fitch Ratings , both the lowest level of investment
grade, Bloomberg data show. Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc.,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. managed the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
