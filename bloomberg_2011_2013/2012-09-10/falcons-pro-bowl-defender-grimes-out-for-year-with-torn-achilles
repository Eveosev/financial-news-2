Atlanta Falcons Pro Bowl cornerback
Brent Grimes will miss the remainder of the season with a torn
Achilles tendon, the National Football League team said.  Grimes, who signed a $10.2 million contract in April after
being designated as the team’s franchise player, was injured
during Atlanta’s 40-24 win over Kansas City yesterday.  Grimes, 29, underwent an MRI exam today, which confirmed
the injury, head coach  Mike Smith  said, according to the team’s
website. In five seasons with the Falcons, Grimes has 13
interceptions.  Pro Bowl cornerback Asante Samuel, who was acquired by
Atlanta from the  Philadelphia Eagles  in the offseason, will
replace Grimes on the left side of the team’s defense, Smith
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
