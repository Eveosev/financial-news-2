(Corrects number of seats picked by professional groups
in second paragraph)  Hong Kong ’s pro-democracy parties
won 18 of 35 seats in the geographical constituencies in
yesterday’s legislative elections.  Ballot-counting continues for five seats elected in a
city-wide ballot. The remaining 30 are picked by professional
groups including finance, accountants and lawyers.  The pro-democracy bloc needs one third of the seats in
the 70-member Legislative Council to retain veto power on
important bills such as constitutional changes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
