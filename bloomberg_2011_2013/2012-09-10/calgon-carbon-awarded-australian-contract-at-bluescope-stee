Calgon Carbon Corp. (CCC) , a Pittsburgh-
based water-purification company, said its Japan subsidiary won
a contract to supply 5.3 million pounds of activated carbon to
 BlueScope Steel Ltd. (BSL)  for the removal of sulfur oxide and
nitrogen oxide from exhaust gases at one of its facilities.  BlueScope, based in Melbourne, is Australia’s biggest mill.
No contract terms were given.  Deliveries of activated carbon will begin immediately and
continue through 2013 to BlueScope’s Port Kembla facility,
Calgon Carbon said today in a statement. Its shares rose as much
as 1.6 percent to a one-month high, paring declines this year to
about 9.3 percent, after the announcement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
