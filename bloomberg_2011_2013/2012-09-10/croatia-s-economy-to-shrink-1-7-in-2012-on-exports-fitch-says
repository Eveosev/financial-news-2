Croatia ’s economy will probably
contract 1.7 percent this year as  Europe ’s debt crisis hinders
export growth,  Fitch Ratings  said.  Croatia, which is set to join the European Union in July
2013, is struggling to revive its economy after three years of
recession or stagnation. Fitch on Sept. 5 revised the country’s
outlook to stable from negative, citing the government’s
progress in meeting spending-cut demands and sticking to its
budget targets during a recession.  The Adriatic Sea nation’s “inability to return to growth
since the 2008 crisis” poses a threat to the country’s fiscal
consolidation efforts and may hinder its efforts to reduce debt,
the credit rating company said today in an e-mailed statement
from London.  Fitch, which affirmed the long-term foreign issuer default
rating at BBB-, said the government needs to increase the labor
participation rate, which at 50 percent is one of lowest in
Europe, according to the International Labor Organization in
Geneva.  The  World Bank  estimated Croatia’s economy will shrink 1
percent in 2012, while the central bank said it will decline 1.6
percent.  Croatia’s rating, Fitch’s lowest investment grade, is on
par with Latvia and Bulgaria.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story: Jasmina
