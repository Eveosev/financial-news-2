Investors should bet the euro will
rally to almost a four-month high versus the yen after it
retraces 38.2 percent of its decline since March, JPMorgan Chase
& Co. said, citing Fibonacci analysis.  The 17-nation currency touched 100.43 yen Sept. 7, the
highest since July 4. If it rises above 100.73 yen, the 38.2
percent Fibonacci retracement level from the 2012 high reached
in March, it may gain to 101.40 yen, followed by 101.83, the
200-day moving average and the highest level since May 22, Niall O’Connor, a New York-based technical analyst at JPMorgan, said
in an interview. A decline below 99.20 yen would suggest the
euro’s strength has dissipated, he said.  The shared currency declined 0.2 percent to 100.06 yen at
1:11 p.m. in  New York . It rallied 1.7 percent last week, its
biggest gain in a month, after touching 94.12 on July 24.  “Trading-wise, as we get closer to 101.40, add to your
short position,” O’Connor said. “Once we get to 101.83, the
euro won’t break out from there without a pullback first.” A
short position is a bet a currency will weaken.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. In
 technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts of
trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
