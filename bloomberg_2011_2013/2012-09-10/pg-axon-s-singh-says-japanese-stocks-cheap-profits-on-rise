Dinakar Singh , founder of $4
billion hedge fund TPG-Axon Capital Management LP, said Japanese
stocks are inexpensive and profits are rising there.  “You look at the U.S. and Europe -- there aren’t a lot of
places where you see margins that have a chance to go up from
here,” said Singh today in an interview on CNBC’s “Squawk
Box.” “In Japan you still do.”  Singh, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partner who co-
founded New York-based TPG-Axon in 2004, said half his assets
are invested in the U.S. His fund is up 12.5 percent this year
through August, according to CNBC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
