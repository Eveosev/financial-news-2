(Corrects record-low auction yield in 17th paragraph.)  The  gap  between yields on Treasury
10-year notes and inflation-linked securities widened to the
most in more than five months amid speculation the  Federal
Reserve ’s efforts to spur the economy will send costs higher.  Thirty-year bond yields reached almost a two-week high as
the U.S. prepared to sell $66 billion of bonds and notes this
week. The so-called 10-year break-even rate, a gauge of traders’
outlook for inflation, climbed for a fifth day after data last
week showed slower job growth, boosting speculation the Fed will
increase asset purchases, or quantitative easing, to support the
economy. The  Federal Open Market Committee  meets on Sept. 12-13.  “When you start talking about more QE, the potential for
inflation concern down the road increases,” said Jason Rogan,
director of U.S. government trading at Guggenheim Partners LLC,
a New York-based brokerage for institutional investors. Further
quantitative easing is “pretty well priced in,” he said.  The benchmark 10-year  yield  dropped one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 1.65 percent at 5 p.m.  New York  time
after falling earlier as much as three basis points. The price
of the 1.625 percent note due in August 2022 rose 1/8, or $1.25
per $1,000 face amount, to 99 23/32.  Thirty-year yields declined two basis points to 2.81
percent after touching 2.863 percent. They reached 2.864 percent
on Sept. 7, the highest level since Aug. 22.  Yield Gap  The yield  difference  between 10-year notes and similar-
maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, which
represents traders’ outlook for the rate of inflation over the
life of the securities, touched 2.40 percentage points today,
the widest since March 22, before slipping to 2.37 percentage
points. The average over the past decade is 2.16.  Treasury volume reported by ICAP Plc, the largest inter-
dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , dropped 45 percent today
to $194 billion. It has averaged $239 billion in 2012.  Volatility dropped to 68 basis points, the lowest level
since Sept. 4, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE
index. The 2012 average is 74 basis points. The index measures
price swings based on options.  The  spread  between 10- and 30-year yields reached 1.18
percentage points, the most since May on a closing basis.
Thirty-year bonds, because of their longer maturity, are more
sensitive to inflation than shorter-dated Treasuries.  U.S. payrolls rose by 96,000 in August, below the 130,000
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey, Labor Department
data showed on Sept. 7. The Fed has already purchased $2.3
trillion of Treasury and mortgage-related debt in two QE rounds
to spur economic recovery.  ‘Weak Number’  “The Fed will do what it thinks it needs to do to support
the economy,” Thomas Girard, a senior managing director who
oversees $150 billion in fixed income at New York Life
Investment Management in New York, said in a telephone interview
Sept. 7. “The jobs number was a weak number, and it increases
the likelihood that the Fed does something.”  The central bank’s favored bond-market  gauge  of inflation
expectations, the five-year, five-year forward break-even rate,
was 2.48 percent on Sept. 5, versus the 2012 average of 2.54
percent. The measure shows how much traders anticipate consumer
prices will rise during a period of five years starting in 2017.  “Entering a possible third round of QE, a bear steepener
is an understandable reaction, but that doesn’t necessarily make
it the right one,”  Jim Vogel , head of agency-debt research at
FTN Financial in  Memphis ,  Tennessee , said in a telephone
interview. “We’re still in a short-term self-correcting phase
where any realized inflation would burn itself out in the next
two to three years because the economy isn’t healthy enough.”
In a bear steepener, longer-maturity yields rise at a faster
pace than shorter-term yields.  Fed Purchase  The Fed bought $1.35 billion of TIPS today as part of a
program to swap shorter-term Treasuries in its holdings with
those due in 6 to 30 years to put downward pressure on long-term
borrowing costs. It purchased securities due from January 2019
to February 2042.  The Treasury will auction $32 billion in three-year debt
tomorrow, $21 billion in 10-year securities Sept. 12 and $13
billion in 30-year bonds the next day.  “The market is nervous about taking down supply in this
environment,” said Thomas Roth, senior Treasury trader in New
York at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA Inc.  The U.S. sold $32 billion of three-year notes at the last
offering, on Aug. 7, drawing a yield of 0.37 percent. The record
low three-year auction yield was 0.334 percent in September
2011.  Auction Demand  The August auction’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing total bids with the amount of securities
offered, was 3.51, matching the average for the past 10 sales.
 Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 29.7 percent of the notes, compared
with an average of 34.1 percent for the past 10 offerings.  Just six months ago, money market traders expected the Fed
to raise  interest rates  by the end of 2013. Now, they see
borrowing costs staying at record lows for about three more
years as the economic outlook worsens.  Bond market measures from overnight index swaps, which
indicate no rise in the federal funds rate until mid-2015, to a
62 percent decline in a measure of  volatility  in  government
bonds  signal that rates will stay near zero for longer. The  gap 
between two- and five-year Treasury yields, which decreases when
traders expect benchmark rates to remain subdued, is more than
50 percent narrower than its average since 2008.  While the economy expanded in the second quarter, the
 unemployment rate  remained above 8 percent for the 43rd-straight
month in August.  ‘Prolonged Period’  “The problems have been bigger than anticipated and it
will take a while to work our way through these issues,” Larry Dyer, a U.S. interest-rate strategist in New York with HSBC
Holdings Plc’s securities unit, said in an interview on Sept. 6.
“The  bond market  is pricing in pretty close to a very prolonged
period of low growth,” said Dyer, whose firm is one of the 21
primary dealers that trade with the central bank.  Treasuries have trailed behind stocks this year even as
global economic growth slowed. Investors in U.S. government
securities earned 2.1 percent in 2012 as of Sept. 7, a Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index shows. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index returned 16 percent, including reinvested dividends.  To contact the reporter on this story:
