Hungaryâ€™s  budget  revenue from a
special tax on lenders may be about 67 billion forint ($301
million) this year, compared with a planned 187 billion forint,
 Nepszabadsag  reported.  Lower revenue is the result of banks being able to deduct
part of their losses on foreign-currency household mortgages,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
