The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities climbed 0.3 percent to 678.97 at 4:23 p.m.
 Singapore  time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
gained 0.5 percent to 1,629.649.  CRUDE OIL  Oil traded in New York near the highest price in a week
amid speculation that countries including the U.S. and China
will add economic stimulus, countering signs of a slowdown
threatening fuel demand.  Crude for October delivery was at $96.16 a barrel in
electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , down 26
cents, at 2:48 p.m. Singapore time. The contract climbed 89
cents, or 0.9 percent, to $96.42 on Sept. 7, the highest close
since Aug. 31. Prices are 2.7 percent lower this year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural-gas futures declined for a fourth day in  New York 
as demand for the fuel for electric generation to power air
conditioners faded with cooler weather.  OIL PRODUCTS  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Asian marker Dubai
crude fell 34 cents to $18.57 a barrel at 10:20 a.m. Singapore
time, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker.
This crack spread, a measure of processing profit, was the
narrowest since Aug. 3. Gasoil swaps for October were unchanged
after rising to $129.85 a barrel, PVM said.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures
rebounded $4 to $117.49 a metric ton at 11:30 a.m. Singapore
time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The difference is
also known as the crack spread. Naphtha swaps for October
increased $4.75, or 0.5 percent, to $979 a ton, according to
PVM. The petrochemical and gasoline feedstock advanced for a
sixth week last week.  BASE METALS  Copper climbed to a 17-week high on speculation that policy
makers from the U.S. to  China  will take additional steps to
bolster growth after disappointing economic data added to the
case for stimulus.  Three-month copper rose as much as 1.3 percent to $8,072.75
a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, the highest price
since May 14, and was at $8,058 at 4:32 p.m. in  Seoul . The price
jumped 4.7 percent last week, the biggest gain since the week to
June 29, after U.S. payrolls data for August missed expectations
and China approved new infrastructure projects.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold, trading near a six-month high, may gain for a third
day on speculation central banks from the U.S. to China will add
to stimulus as economic data disappoints. Palladium rallied to
the highest level in four months.  Cash gold was at $1,736.80 an ounce at 2:18 p.m. in
Singapore after earlier rising 0.3 percent. The metal gained to
$1,741.70 on Sept. 7, the most expensive since Feb. 29, after
U.S. jobs growth in August trailed estimates. Assets in gold-
backed exchange-traded products expanded to a record 2,474.117
metric tons on Sept. 7, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Cash palladium rose for a seventh day in the best run since
January as labor disputes in  South Africa , the second-largest
producer, cut supplies. The metal gained as much as 1.5 percent
to $664 an ounce, the highest since May 4, and traded at
$658.50.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Wheat advanced for a third day on signs that demand for the
grain from the U.S., the largest shipper, is rising as supply
from cheaper origins including  Russia  begins to decline. Corn
and soybeans fell.  The December-delivery contract gained as much as 0.6
percent to $9.10 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, before
trading at $9.0875 at 1:57 p.m. Singapore time.  Soybean futures declined for a fourth day, the longest
losing streak for the most-active contract since January, as
export sales in the U.S., the world’s largest grower last year,
fell. The November-delivery contract fell as much as 1.2 percent
to $17.16 a bushel, before trading at $17.3375.  Corn for December delivery traded 0.2 percent lower at
$7.98 a bushel, after declining as much as 0.8 percent earlier.
Futures surged to a record $8.49 a bushel on Aug. 10.  Palm oil  fell for a fifth day, set for the longest losing
run since November, as stockpiles in  Malaysia , the second-
largest producer, climbed to a 10-month high, boosting global
vegetable-oil supplies.  The November-delivery contract fell as much as 1 percent to
2,897 ringgit ($933) a metric ton and ended the morning session
at 2,918 ringgit in  Kuala Lumpur . Futures lost 3.1 percent last
week and have declined 8.1 percent this year.  Palm oil for January delivery climbed 0.4 percent to 8,006
 yuan  ($1,264) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .  Soybean
oil  for delivery in the same month rose 0.3 percent to 10,050
yuan a ton.  Rubber gained for a third day to the highest level in seven
weeks on speculation that countries from the U.S. to China may
announce stimulus to boost their economies, improving demand for
the commodity used in tires.  To contact the reporter on this story:
