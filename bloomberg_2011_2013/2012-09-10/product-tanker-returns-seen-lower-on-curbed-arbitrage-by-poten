Returns for tankers carrying oil
products from the U.S. slumped after price gains in the country
and  Europe  limited the incentive for trans-Atlantic shipments,
according to Poten & Partners Inc.  Earnings for ships hauling European gasoline to the U.S.
East Coast and transporting diesel on the return voyage slid to
$6,500 a day after reaching $14,000 in May, the New York-based
shipbroker said in a report Sept. 7.  European diesel prices jumped because of reduced refinery
capacity in the Atlantic region, which ordinarily would spur
flows of cargoes to northwest Europe or Mediterranean Sea ports
from the U.S. Gulf Coast, Poten said. Diesel prices also climbed
in the U.S. because of limited supply, curbing the so-called
arbitrage for trans-Atlantic cargoes, the report showed.  The flow of refined products across the ocean is set to
recover as U.S. refineries resume output and European plants
enter a maintenance period, Poten said.  An explosion and fire at  Venezuela ’s Amuay refinery, the
country’s biggest, a blaze at Chevron Corp.’s Richmond plant in
 California  and shutdowns because of Hurricane Isaac led to the
reduction in capacity, according to the shipbroker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
