Buyers of sugar from  Brazil , the
world’s largest producer, are getting a smaller discount for
their sweetener, with the amount of sugar awaiting loading at
the country’s ports rising 21 percent last week.  Raw sugar for loading this month at the port of Santos,
Brazil’s biggest, was at a discount of 0.05 cent to 0.12 cent a
pound to the price of the October contract on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York, Swiss Sugar Brokers said in a report dated
yesterday. That compares with 0.2 cent a pound on Sept. 1. A
cargo of raw sugar for loading in Santos traded at a discount of
0.08 cent a pound last week, according to SA Commodities.  About 2.3 million metric tons of sugar awaited loading at
the ports of Paranagua and Santos on Sept. 5, according to e-
mailed data from shipping agency Williams Servicos Maritimos
Ltda. That’s up from 1.91 million tons a week earlier, said the
Recife, Brazil-based company.  “Shipments to the  Far East  and to the traditional
refineries in the  Middle East  and North Africa are maintaining a
good shipping rate,”  Naim Beydoun , a broker at Swiss Sugar
Brokers in Rolle,  Switzerland , said in the report.  The  white sugar premium  over the raw variety has climbed 38
percent so far this year to $122.04 a ton, making refining more
attractive even as demand remains weak, he said. A “hesitant
strengthening of cash values for September shipment” is in
conflict with the fundamentals of the sugar market, he said.  Global sugar supplies will be 5.9 million tons higher than
demand in the season starting in October, according to the
 International Sugar Organization . That is up from a surplus
forecast of 5.2 million tons in 2011-12, the London-based sugar
group estimates.  White, or refined, sugar for March delivery was up 0.2
percent to $550.30 a ton by 10:15 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in  London .
Raw sugar for October delivery rose 0.3 percent to 19.43 cents a
pound on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
