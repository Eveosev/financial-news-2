Peyton Manning ’s Denver Broncos
debut posted the best overnight rating for any primetime
National Football League game on NBC, the network said on its
Twitter feed.  The game’s 18.0 rating for Denver’s 31-19 win over the
Pittsburgh Steelers, which featured Manning’s first game after a
year off because of injury, is the best for any primetime game
in 15 years,  Comcast (CMCSA)  Corp.’s NBC Universal said.  NBC’s previous best overnight was a 17.7 for the 2010
opener, which was a National Football Conference championship
game rematch between the Super Bowl champion New Orleans Saints
and  Brett Favre ’s Minnesota Vikings.  The Pittsburgh-Denver game was up 8 percent from last
year’s first game on NBC, a matchup between Dallas and the  New
York  Jets.  The Denver market drew a 44.2 rating and 67 share, best for
that city for an NFL regular-season game on any network since
2003.  Indianapolis, where Manning used to play, posted a 28.9
rating and 42 share, making it the No. 3 market overall for the
game.  Manning, 36, threw two touchdown passes, including the go-
ahead score with about 9 minutes left in the game. A four-time
Most Valuable Player who missed last season after neck surgery,
Manning completed 19 of 26 passes for 253 yards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
