Gasoline gained after a report that
flooding and mechanical issues have slowed the startup of Motiva
Enterprises LLC’s Convent,  Louisiana , refinery as it tries to
return to production after Hurricane Isaac.  Futures rose as Motiva expects to need another week to get
the main production units running at the 255,000-barrel-a-day
plant, according to two people familiar with operations. Three
refineries in the  Gulf Coast  are starting and six are at reduced
rates after the storm, which knocked out 13 percent of the
area’s refining capacity when it struck Aug. 29.  “The ongoing problems with refinery restarts are a
surprise to analysts and suggest the product market may be in
disarray for weeks,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at
Price Futures Group in Chicago.  October-delivery reformulated gasoline, or RBOB, advanced
1.95 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $3.0391 a gallon at 11:21 a.m. on
the  New York  Mercantile exchange.  Motiva expects to return its Norco plant to normal
operating rates by Sept. 15, said the people, who declined to be
identified because they are not authorized to speak for the
refinery. The Norco refinery was shut Aug. 30. The Convent
refinery was shut Aug. 28.  The restarts of Valero Energy Corp.’s two Louisiana
refineries “are progressing as planned,”  Bill Day , a spokesman
for Valero in  San Antonio , said in an e-mail today.  Gulf Coast refinery utilization dropped to 82.2 percent in
the week ended Aug. 27 from 91.4 percent a week earlier,
according to Energy Department data. Stockpiles in the U.S. sank
1.2 percent last week to 198.9 million barrels, the lowest level
since the week ended Nov. 14.  Regular  gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide,
increased 0.3 cent to $3.828 a gallon yesterday, AAA data
showed. Prices are up 50.2 cents from the year-to-date low of
$3.326 on July 1.  Heating oil for October delivery rose 1.53 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $3.1642 a gallon.  To contact the reporters on this story:
