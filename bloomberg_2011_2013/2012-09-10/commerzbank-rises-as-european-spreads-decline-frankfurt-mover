Commerzbank AG (CBK) , Germany’s second-
biggest bank, rose as much as 6 percent in Frankfurt trading as
spreads on peripheral euro-area bonds narrowed after last week’s
announcement by the  European Central Bank .  Commerzbank was up 3 percent to 1.43 euros by 12:59 p.m.
local time, valuing the company at 8.4 billion euros ($10.7
billion). The stock has climbed 10 percent this year.  “The bank has a lot of peripheral debt exposure and
falling spreads in the debt crisis countries is good news for
the bank,” said Guido Hoymann, an analyst with Bankhaus Metzler
who recommends selling the shares. “In addition, the bank is
exposed to loans to peripheral Europe via Eurohypo.”  ECB President  Mario Draghi ’s plan to support bond markets
announced last week sent Spanish 10-year yields down the most in
a week since the euro’s inception. Spain’s 10-year yield fell
further today, dropping 5 basis points to 5.58 percent as of
11:55 a.m. in Madrid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
