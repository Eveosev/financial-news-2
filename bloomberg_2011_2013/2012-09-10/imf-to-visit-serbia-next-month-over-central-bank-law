An International Monetary Fund
mission opened talks with Serbian officials today on changes to
laws governing the central bank and the countryâ€™s economy.  Representatives of the Washington-base lender, which
suspended a $1.3 billion arrangement with the Balkan nation in
February, met with the central bank governor and ministers at
the start of a week-long, fact-finding mission, the central bank
said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
