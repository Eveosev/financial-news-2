Sasol Ltd. (SOL)  rose to its highest in
six months after full-year profit increased and the largest
producer of motor fuels from coal raised its dividend 35
percent.  Sasol rallied 2.6 percent to 383.66 rand at the close in
Johannesburg, its highest since March 14. The stock has gained
8.5 percent in the last three days as oil traded near the
highest level in a week in New York amid speculation that the
U.S. and China will implement measures to revive their
economies.  Earnings excluding one-time items climbed 25 percent to
42.28 rand a share in the year through June as  oil prices  gained
and the rand weakened against the dollar, Johannesburg-based
Sasol said in a statement. The dividend was raised 35 percent to
17.50 rand a share, it said. Sasol benefits from rising energy
prices because its fuel prices are linked to crude oil. The
company also gains from a weaker rand because most of its
products are sold at dollar-denominated prices, while it meets
most costs in the South African currency.  “The company posted very solid results and are giving a
good increase in the dividend,”  David Shapiro , a director at
Johannesburg-based Sasfin Securities, said by phone. “Sasol has
been one of the cheapest stocks and these results highlight its
attraction.”  Sasol trades at 9.1 times earnings while the broader
 FTSE/JSE Africa All Shares Index (JALSH)  trades at 13.7 times profit.  Sasol uses proprietary Fischer-Tropsch technology to make
gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from coal it mines in  South Africa 
and natural gas from below the ocean floor near Qatar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
