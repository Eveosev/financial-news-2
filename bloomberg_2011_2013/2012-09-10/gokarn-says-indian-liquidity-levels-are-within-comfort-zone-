Subir Gokarn, the deputy governor
of the  Reserve Bank of India , comments on liquidity in the
banking system and the nation’s foreign-exchange reserves. He
was speaking to reporters in  New Delhi  today.  On liquidity:  “For the last several weeks, liquidity levels have been in
our comfort zone. If signs of stress emerge, particularly if
they are likely to be persistent, then we’ll take that into
account. We have not, for quite some time, felt that there was
stress in the market, both in terms of quantity of borrowing
under the liquidity adjustment facility and behavior of call
rate.”  On foreign reserves:  “I think the dollar reserve is a strategic resource and it
is something we have to measure against potential short-term
liability. We have never been uncomfortable with the level of
reserves we have had.  “Intervention had been one component of our approach to the
 exchange rate . Others have been in terms of some administrative
actions which we took in November and December. We have rolled
back some of those because we felt they were adding some stress
to the market.  “Over the last several weeks the currency has been
relatively stable and that would suggest that there is a rough
balance between inflows and outflows. We are monitoring the
situation and will react to it as appropriate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
