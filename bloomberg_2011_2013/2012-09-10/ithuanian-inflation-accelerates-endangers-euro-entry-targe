Lithuanian  inflation  accelerated in
August to the fastest in five months as household costs surged.  Consumer prices rose 3.3 percent from last year, compared
with 2.8 percent in July, the  statistics office  in the capital,
Vilnius, said in an e-mailed statement today. Prices increased
0.2 percent on the month.  Lithuania  needs price growth to slow to remain on track for
euro adoption in 2014. In 2006, Lithuania became the only nation
rejected for the currency switch after it missed an inflation
target by 0.1 percentage point.  Standard & Poor’s  warned on Aug. 31 that rising gas and
heating prices may spur price growth, hindering plans to meet
inflation criteria for euro adoption. Household expenses such as
gas, water and electricity rose the most of any category in the
index, advancing 5.4 percent from a year earlier, the statistics
office said.  “Whatever the case, we believe that Lithuania’s
authorities may hesitate to apply for euro-zone membership for
as long as the economic and debt crises in the  euro zone 
persist,” the ratings company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
