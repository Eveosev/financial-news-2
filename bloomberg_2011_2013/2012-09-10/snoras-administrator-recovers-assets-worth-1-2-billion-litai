The administrator to Bankas Snoras
AB recovered assets worth 1.2 billion litai ($440 million) for
the bank’s creditors since it was appointed in December.  The administrator collected funds from the bank’s loan
holders and recouped assets in 25 countries, the Vilnius-based
bank said in a statement on its website today.  Snoras was declared insolvent in November after the central
bank discovered assets were missing at the lender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
