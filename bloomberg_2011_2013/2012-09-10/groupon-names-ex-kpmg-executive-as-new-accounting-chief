Groupon Inc. (GRPN) , operator of the
largest daily-deal website, named former KPMG LLP executive
Brian Stevens as Chief Accounting Officer.  Stevens, who worked for 16 years at accounting firm KPMG
LLP, will report to Groupon Chief Financial Officer Jason Child,
the Chicago-based company said today in a statement. Joe Del
Preto will continue as global controller, reporting to Stevens.  Groupon has tumbled 79 percent since selling shares at $20
apiece in a November initial public offering as a series of
accounting restatements rattled investors. The company in March
reported “material weakness” in financial controls, a move
that was preceded by the restatement of 2010 earnings results.
While Ernst & Young LLP was Groupon’s auditor,  KPMG  has worked
to help address accounting flaws, the company said in April.  The shares were unchanged at $4.27 at the close in  New
York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
