Syrian Air  has increased the number
of its flights to  Beirut  and is running two a week to  Jordan  to
reduce the impact of the European Union’s ban on the company,
the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said.  The measure is aimed at facilitating the movement of
Syrians to Europe, the agency said. Ghaydaa Abd-al-Latif, the
company’s director general, told SANA the airline is working
with attorneys to prepare a lawsuit against the EU because “it
is committed to international laws and has made no violations
since the suspension decision.” She said the EU ban has
affected 5,400 working families.  To contact the reporter on this story:
