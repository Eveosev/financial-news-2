African leaders will send 4,000
troops to eastern  Democratic Republic  of Congo within three
months to combat rebels, New Vision reported, citing Henry Okello Oryem, the Ugandan minister of state for foreign affairs.  Tanzania is ready to deploy troops to the force and the 11-
member International Conference of the Great Lakes Region has
asked other countries to contribute troops within a month, the
Kampala-based newspaper cited the minister as saying on Sept. 8
at the end of the groupâ€™s two-day meeting on the Congo conflict.  Fighting in eastern Congo resumed in April after fighters
of the M23, a group of former rebels headed by General Bosco Ntaganda, abandoned the army and resumed their insurgency.
Ntaganda is wanted by the  International Criminal Court  for
alleged  war crimes .  To contact the reporter on this story:
