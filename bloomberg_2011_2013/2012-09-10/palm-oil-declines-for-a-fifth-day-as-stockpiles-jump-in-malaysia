Palm oil  fell for a fifth day, set
for the longest losing run since November, as stockpiles in
Malaysia, the second-largest producer, climbed to a 10-month
high, boosting global vegetable-oil supplies.  The November-delivery contract fell as much as 1 percent to
2,897 ringgit ($933) a metric ton and ended the morning session
at 2,918 ringgit in  Kuala Lumpur . Futures lost 3.1 percent last
week and have declined 8.1 percent this year.  Stockpiles rose 5.8 percent to 2.12 million tons in August
from a month ago, the highest level since October, the Malaysian
Palm Oil Board said today. Output declined 1.7 percent to 1.66
million tons, while exports rose 10 percent to 1.43 million
tons, it said. Exports may drop this year due to reduced output,
Lee Yeow Chor, chairman of Malaysian Palm Oil Council said.  “Higher availability of palm oil in  Malaysia  on improved
stockpiles is” weighing on prices, Karvy Comtrade Ltd., a
Hyderabad-India based brokerage said in a report today. “Losses
in palm oil futures prices seem to be limited on improved
Malaysian exports.”  Exports rose 26.8 percent to 453,302 tons in the first 10
days of September from a month ago, independent market surveyor
Intertek said today.  Soybean futures dropped for a fourth day, the longest
losing streak since January, as U.S. export sales declined .The
November-delivery contract fell 0.2 percent to $17.33 a bushel
on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Soybean oil  for December delivery
rose 0.3 percent to 56.83 cents a pound. Soybean oil and palm
oil are used in foods and fuels.  Palm oil for January delivery climbed 0.4 percent to 8,006
 yuan  ($1,264) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange . Soybean
oil for delivery in the same month rose 0.3 percent to 10,050
yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
