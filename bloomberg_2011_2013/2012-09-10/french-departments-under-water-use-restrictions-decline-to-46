The number of  France ’s 96 mainland
departments subject to limits on water use after dry weather
fell by one from the end of last week to 46, the  Environment
Ministry  reported.  The departments had at least one local limit or ban on
water use in place as of midnight, according to an online  report 
by the ministry today.  Restrictions were at “crisis” level in 26 departments,
meaning authorities implemented the most severe level of curbs,
including a ban on water use for agriculture, the report showed.
That’s down by one from last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
