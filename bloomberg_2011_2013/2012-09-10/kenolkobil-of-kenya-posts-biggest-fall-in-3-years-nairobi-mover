KenolKobil Ltd. (KNOC) , a Kenyan fuel
retailer with operations in nine African countries, fell the
most in more than three years after posting a first-half loss.  The stock dropped as much as 14 percent and was down 13
percent at 13.15 shilling by the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi, the
capital. That’s the biggest drop since April 7, 2009, and the
lowest close since June 21.  The company on Sept. 7 reported a loss of 3.9 billion
shillings ($46 million) for the six months through June,
compared with a profit of 2.3 billion shillings a year earlier.
It blamed a “depressed” global economic environment, lower  oil
prices , high domestic inflation and borrowing costs. The most
significant impact on results was a 4.2 billion-shilling loss on
its foreign-exchange hedges, KenolKobil said.  “The results released were below market expectations with
massive losses, whereas the market expected some profits,” John
Kamunya, a research analyst at Nairobi-based Sterling Capital
Ltd., said on phone today.  The stock may decline further, Doreen Marete, a trader at
Sterling Capital, said in a separate interview.  “We are seeing huge demand levels at 10 shillings with
sellers seeking to offload at 14 shillings a share,” she said.  KenolKobil announced on May 8 its main shareholders agreed
to sell their stake to Puma Energy BV, a unit of Trafigura
Beheer BV. Puma will offer to buy 100 percent of KenolKobil
after due diligence is completed, the Kenyan company said on May
15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
