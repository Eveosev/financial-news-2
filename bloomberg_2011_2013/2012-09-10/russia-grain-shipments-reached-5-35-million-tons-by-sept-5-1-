Russia, the world’s third biggest
wheat exporter last season, exported 5.35 million metric tons of
grains by Sept. 5, compared with 6.55 million tons a year
earlier, the  Agriculture Ministry  said.  Exports were 536,000 tons in the first five days of this
month, the ministry said in a statement on its website today,
citing the Federal Customs Service data. The shipments included
488,000 tons of  wheat , 41,000 tons of barley and 3,000 tons of
corn.  Grain prices continued to rise in the Asian areas of Ural
and Siberia, where the new crop supply was insufficient, the
ministry said, adding they changed “insignificantly” in the
European part of the country last week.  The average price for third-grade milling wheat increased
1.8 percent week-on-week to 8,073 rubles ($255) a ton today in
the European part of the country, the ministry said. Fourth-
grade milling wheat rose 2.3 percent to 7,810 rubles a ton and
feed wheat rose 2.5 percent to 7,447 rubles a ton.  New crop supplies and shifts in world prices will determine
local costs during the next few weeks, the ministry said. Grains
have suffered due to drought in the country this year.  Wheat for December delivery was little changed at $9.0575 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 7:43 p.m. Moscow time.
It’s advanced 39 percent this year.  Russia ’s wheat exports are expected to drop to 8 million
tons this season from 21.6 million tons a year earlier, making
it the fifth-largest shipper, according to U.S. Department of
Agriculture Estimates. The U.S.,  Australia ,  Canada  and the
European Union would be the top four in 2012-13, USDA estimated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
