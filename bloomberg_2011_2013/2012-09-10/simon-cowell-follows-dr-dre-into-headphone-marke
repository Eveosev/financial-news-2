TV personality  Simon Cowell  says he
can make better-sounding headphones than Dr. Dre.  Cowell, a producer and judge on “The X Factor” singing
competition, unveiled the X Headphones today as part of a
collaboration with  Sony Corp. (6758)  The partners will offer the
product line through their Syco Entertainment joint venture.  The effort will compete against Beats Electronics LLC, the
maker of Beats by Dre devices. That business, founded six years
ago by music producer Jimmy Iovine and rapper Dr. Dre, has said
it has 30 percent of the premium headphone market, citing
figures from NPD Group Inc.  “I chose to make a set of headphones with Sony because I
simply wanted something better than what is in the market
today,” Cowell said in a statement. “I’ve tried all of them,
literally every single one. Sony and I set out to create the
best headphone in the world.”   To contact the reporter on this story:
