Local government pension plans saw
an eight percent jump in their aggregate funding ratio from 2010
to 2011, Wilshire Associates said, citing its 2012 report on the
funding of city and county pension plans.  The estimated ratio of pension assets-to-liabilities, or
funding ratio, for all 106 city and county pension plans
included in the study was 80 percent in 2011, higher than the 72
percent for all plans in 2010, said Russ Walker, vice president
of Wilshire Associates, said today in a statement.  “Strong  investment performance  from early 2009 to the
second quarter of 2011 fueled aggregate plan asset growth that
outpaced the aggregate growth in plan liabilities,” Walker said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
