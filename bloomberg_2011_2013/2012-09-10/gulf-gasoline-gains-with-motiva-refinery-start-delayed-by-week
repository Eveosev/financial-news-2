Gulf Coast  gasoline strengthened as
Motiva Enterprises LLC expected to need another week to start
units at its Convent,  Louisiana , refinery.  The 255,000-barrel-a-day plant has been hampered by
floodwaters and mechanical issues that prevented the fluid
catalytic cracker from being restarted, according to two people
familiar with operations. The refinery shut Aug. 28 in advance
of Hurricane Isaac.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast rose 1 cent to 12.25 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 3:55 p.m. New York
time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
rose 1.54 cents to $3.1486 a gallon.  Motiva expects to return its Norco, Louisiana, refinery to
normal operating rates by Sept. 15, according to two people
familiar with the plant’s operation. The 250,000-barrel-a-day
refinery, shut Aug. 30, is increasing production, they said.  Petroleos de Venezuela SA  said a flexicoker at its Amuay
refinery began to process 33,000 barrels a day after the plant’s
main units were taken offline because of an Aug. 25 explosion.  Amuay is processing 264,000 barrels of crude a day out of a
capacity of 645,000 barrels and is bringing other units online
gradually, PDVSA said today in an e-mailed statement.  Conventional 87-octane gasoline in  New York  Harbor rose 5
cents to a premium of 41 cents a gallon versus futures, the
widest since Sept. 16, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
