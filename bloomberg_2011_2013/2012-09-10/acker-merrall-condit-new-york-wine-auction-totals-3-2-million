Acker Merrall & Condit said it sold
$3.2 million of wine at its New York auction Sept. 8, with a
case of 1953 Chateau Lafite-Rothschild selling for $34,400 and
12 bottles of 1962 Leroy Romanee Saint-Vivant fetching $29,520.
A case of 1959 Faiveley Musigny also sold for $27,060.  Acker’s next sale is in  Hong Kong  on Sept. 21 and Sept. 22,
featuring Krug and Roederer Cristal Champagne. After Hong Kong’s
recent dominance over New York in the wine market, “things are
definitely leveling out a bit,” Acker Chief Executive Officer
 John Kapon  said in a phone interview before the weekend sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
