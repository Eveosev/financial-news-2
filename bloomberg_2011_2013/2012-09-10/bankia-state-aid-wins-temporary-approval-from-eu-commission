BFA, the parent of  Spain ’s  Bankia
SA (BKIA) , won temporary European Union approval to receive a 4.5
billion-euro ($5.75 billion) recapitalization from Spain’s
banking bailout fund FROB, the European Commission  said  today.  “The Spanish authorities have committed to present a
restructuring plan in time to allow the Commission to approve
the plan by November 2012,” the regulator said in a statement
on its website.  The nationalized lender last month posted a 4.45 billion-
euro first-half loss. European Union officials must approve
government rescue funding for banks and can require lenders to
shed units and change business behavior.  The Bankia group’s request in May for 19 billion euros of
state aid to clean up soured assets on its books focused
investor concerns about the state of Spanish lenders and helped
push the government into seeking a 100 billion-euro bailout for
its financial system in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
