French employers should hire more
workers on a permanent basis, rather than on temporary contracts
that have become prevalent in recent years, Labor Minister
Michel Sapin said in an interview on France 2 television.  Reforms are needed to ensure that permanent work contracts
are “the rule,” he said, without giving specific proposals,
adding that unemployment will start to decline by end of 2013.  The government plans to raise 20 billion euros ($25.6
billion) in taxes and to cut spending by 10 billion euros as
part of a recovery plan, and not austerity measures, Sapin told
the tv station.  To contact the reporter on this story:
