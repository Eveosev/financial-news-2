The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of
24  raw materials  rose 0.2 percent to 677.92 at 3:25 p.m.  New
York  time, led by coffee.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI index of 26 prices advanced 0.5
percent to 1,629.27 at 4:19 p.m.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Arabica-coffee futures climbed the most since January 2009
on speculation that supplies will tighten in  South America , the
world’s top producing region.  Output in  Colombia , the second-biggest grower of the
variety, may reach 9 million bags this season, down from a
previous forecast of 9.5 million, Agriculture Minister Juan
Camilo Restrepo said in an interview on Radio Caracol. Exports
from  Brazil , the top grower, may drop as much 11 percent this
year from 2011 after rains delayed the crop and hurt bean
quality, an industry group said on Sept. 6.  On ICE Futures U.S. in New York, arabica coffee for
December delivery surged 6.5 percent to $1.7365 a pound, the
biggest gain for a most-active contract since Jan. 6, 2009.  Cocoa for delivery in December declined 0.9 percent to
$2,653 a metric ton.  Cotton futures for December delivery fell 0.9 percent to

percent to $1.2685 a pound, the first drop in nine sessions.  Raw-sugar futures for October delivery advanced 0.3 percent
to 19.43 cents a pound.  BASE METALS  Copper rose to a four-month high after weaker Chinese
industrial production fueled bets that policy makers will take
further steps to bolster growth in the world’s biggest consumer
of the metal.  On the Comex in New York, copper futures for December
delivery gained 1.2 percent to $3.6885 a pound. Earlier, the
price reached $3.70, the highest since May 10.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months rose 1.2 percent to $8,068 a ton ($3.66 a pound). Tin,
lead, aluminum, zinc and nickel also gained.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas climbed the most since July on speculation that
government data will show a smaller-than-normal increase in
stockpiles after production shutdowns from Hurricane Isaac.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , gas futures for
October delivery rose 4.8 percent to $2.812 per million British
thermal units, the biggest gain since July 30.  U.K. gas for same-day delivery declined for the first time
in four days as demand was predicted to approach a record low
amid reduced Norwegian flows.  Gas for today fell 0.5 pence, or 0.8 percent, to 59.9 pence
a therm at 4:45 p.m. London time. The October price dropped 1.3
percent to 59.2 pence a therm. That’s equivalent to $9.48 per
million Btu. A therm is 100,000 Btu.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline gained after a report that flooding and mechanical
issues slowed the startup of Motiva Enterprises LLC’s Convent,
 Louisiana , refinery as it tries to return to production after
Hurricane Isaac.  On the Nymex, gasoline futures for October delivery rose
0.1 percent to $3.024 a gallon.  Heating-oil futures for October delivery climbed 0.6

$1.2575 a pound in the biggest drop since Aug. 27.  Feeder-cattle futures for October settlement rose 0.3
percent to $1.46575 a pound.  CRUDE OIL  Crude oil was little changed as Greece struggled to qualify
for aid payments and amid speculation that the  Federal Reserve 
will announce measures this week to revive the economy.  On the Nymex, oil futures for October delivery rose 0.1
percent to $96.54 a barrel.  Brent oil for October settlement climbed 0.5 percent to
$114.73 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe 
exchange.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc failed to sell a North Sea Forties
crude cargo at a lower price than the previous trade. Glencore
International Plc sold Russian Urals blend in northwest Europe
at the lowest in five months.  Daily exports of the 12 main grades of North Sea crude for
loading in October will climb to the highest in four months as
fields return from planned maintenance.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold retreated the most in three weeks as the dollar rose
against the euro on  Greece ’s struggles to qualify for aid
payments, curbing demand for the metal as an alternative
investment.  On the Comex, gold futures for December delivery slid 0.5
percent to $1,731.80 an ounce, the biggest decline since Aug.
