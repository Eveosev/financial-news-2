AVI Ltd. (AVI) ,  South Africa ’s second-
largest consumer-goods maker, said reduced demand may boost
competition at a time when costs are rising.  Net income rose 38 percent to 970 million rand ($118.3
million) in the year through June, the Johannesburg-based
company said in a statement to the stock exchange today.  “We anticipate that the current constrained consumer
demand environment will persist and consequently expect
increased competition in our categories which, coupled with raw
material and other cost pressures, will put pressure on margins
in the fast-moving consumer goods sector generally,” AVI said.  AVI shares rose 3.1 percent to 59.73 rand as of 9:09 a.m.
in Johannesburg today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
