Heckmann Corp. (HEK) , which treats and
disposes of water generated by energy companies involved in oil
and natural gas production, said it acquired a majority stake in
Appalachian Water Systems LLC. No terms were given.  The Coraopolis, Pennsylvania-based water-services company
said AWS will be an integral part of Heckmann’s fluid management
strategy. AWS owns and operates “a state-of-the-art wastewater
treatment recycling facility specifically designed to treat and
recycle water involved in the hydraulic fracturing” or fracking
process in the Marcellus shale area, Heckmann said.  On Sept. 4, Heckmann surged 38 percent, the most since it
began trading in 2007, after agreeing to buy Badlands Energy LLC
for $381 million to expand services to oil producers that use
hydraulic fracturing. In April, the company paid $245 million to
buy Thermo Fluids Inc., which recycles used motor oil.  “This addition expands our operations in the southern
Marcellus shale area with new environmentally friendly recycling
options for our clients that complement our freshwater transfer,
water transportation and disposal services,” John T. Lucey Jr.,
executive vice president for business development and
engineering for the environmental services company, said in
today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
