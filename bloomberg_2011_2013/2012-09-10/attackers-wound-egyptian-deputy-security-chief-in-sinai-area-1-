Egypt ’s deputy head of security in
Sinai and three other officers were wounded in an attack, the
Middle East  News Agency  reported.  The four, including deputy security head General Hatem Amin
and another general, were hospitalized following a gun attack on
their vehicle in the Wadi Feran area, the news agency said.  Last month, military and interior ministry forces launched
the largest offensive in the peninsula for decades after 16
Egyptian soldiers were killed on Aug. 5 by unidentified
militants seeking to enter Israel.  Egyptian forces subsequently killed seven armed suspects in
a raid on a house, while three policemen were killed when their
vehicle overturned as they chased a gang of criminals, officials
said.  The Sinai offensive targeted armed militant groups
that have grown in strength since  Hosni Mubarak ’s removal from
office last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
