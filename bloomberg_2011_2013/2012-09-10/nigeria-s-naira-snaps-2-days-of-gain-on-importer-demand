The naira weakened for the first
time in three days as importers sought dollars and the central
bank cut supply of the U.S currency at an auction.  The currency of  Africa ’s top oil producer fell 0.1 percent
to 157.65 a dollar in the interbank market as of 3:56 p.m. in
Lagos, the commercial capital, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold $180 million at a foreign-
currency auction today, the lowest since Aug. 29, the Abuja-
based bank said in an e-mailed statement. The West African
nation relies on imports to meet more than 70 percent of
domestic fuel needs because of a lack of refining capacity,
according to the Petroleum Ministry.  “The naira lost ground against the dollar at the beginning
of last week as bids, which were not fulfilled at the CBN’s
auction on Monday, spilled over into the  interbank market ,
creating a liquidity imbalance,” Celeste Fauconnier and Nema Ramkhelawan-Bhana, strategists at Rand Merchant Bank, wrote in a
report today.  The yield on  Nigeria ’s 7 percent domestic bonds due 2019
retreated four basis points to 13.78 percent, according to Sept.
7 data on the Financial Markets Dealers Association website.
Yields on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due 2021 were
little changed at 4.869 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi gained for a fourth day by 0.2 percent to
1.8980 a dollar in Accra, the capital, its strongest since June
4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
