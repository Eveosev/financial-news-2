Gleadell Agriculture Ltd., a U.K.
grain trader, said it loaded about 19,000 metric tons of feed
wheat for shipping to  Portugal .  Loading of the Zapolyarye at the company’s Great Yarmouth
terminal in eastern  England  was “just” completed,
Gainsborough, England-based Gleadell wrote in a  statement  on its
website today.  Gleadell, a joint venture of Hamburg-based grain trader
Alfred C. Toepfer International GmbH and Paris-based cooperative
Union InVivo, started operating the Great Yarmouth terminal in
July 2010.  “We have just loaded the largest ship ever in Norfolk and
Suffolk,” Trevor Gates, Gleadell’s regional manager for East
Anglia, was cited as saying in the statement. “Our export
campaign is providing marketing outlets for East Anglian farmers
in a difficult season.”  The terminal at Great Yarmouth, a coastal town in the
county of Norfolk, has an 18,000-ton storage facility and can
load vessels of up to 25,000 tons, according to the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
