Brenntag AG (BNR) , the chemical
distributor aspiring to join  Germany ’s benchmark DAX Index,
surged in Frankfurt trading, exceeding 100 euros ($127.89) for
the first time and reaching the highest level since its March
2010 initial public offering.  The stock gained as much as 4.6 percent, the biggest
intraday advance since June. Brenntag was up 1.3 percent at
97.77 euros as of 11:28 a.m., bringing the gain to 36 percent
this year and giving the company a market value of 5.04 billion
euros, exceeding that of DAX-listed  Deutsche Lufthansa AG. (LHA)   Brenntag has the potential to continue fast growth, said
Heiko Feber, an analyst at Bankhaus Lampe KG. Earnings per share
may rise 20 percent this year, according to the average estimate
of 14 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Brenntag has accelerated
growth with acquisitions, spending at least $461 million on
purchases since its listing in 2010, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  “Chemical distribution is an area that has lots of small
contractors so they can benefit through consolidation,” said
Feber, who has a buy recommendation on the stock. “There is
also a range of chemical companies that are outsourcing
distribution.”  Last year, Brenntag bought Multisol of the U.K. for 112.1
million pounds ($179.3 million) and in 2010 it bought EAC
Industrial Ingredients Ltd. in  Denmark  for 160 million euros.
Annual sales rose more than 13 percent in 2011 as earnings per
share climbed 84 percent to 5.39 euros.  “More investors are probably taking a look at the stock,”
said Jesko Mayer-Wegelin, an analyst at HSBC Trinkaus &
Burkhardt AG. “If they continue to do as well as they have
been, they are a potential candidate for the DAX next year.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
