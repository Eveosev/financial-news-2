The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission canceled a meeting to consider rules for protecting
customer funds held by futures commission merchants after agency
Chairman  Gary Gensler  injured himself over the weekend.  Gensler “fell at his home in suburban Washington yesterday
and suffered a few cracked ribs,”  Steven Adamske , the agency’s
spokesman, said in an e-mail today. “The meeting scheduled for
Wednesday has been canceled, and the subject matters will be
handled” in a non-public vote, Adamske said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
