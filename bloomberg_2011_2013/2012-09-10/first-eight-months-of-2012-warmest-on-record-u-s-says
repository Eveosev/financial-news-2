The first eight months of 2012 in
the lower 48 U.S. states were the warmest start to any year in
records dating to 1895, according to the  National Climatic Data
Center  in Asheville,  North Carolina .  The period from January through August also was the 14th
driest for the region, with precipitation 1.9 inches (4.8
centimeters) below the 20.2-inch average, the center said.  June to August was the third-warmest summer on record as
temperatures averaged 74.4 degrees Fahrenheit (23.6 Celsius) or
2.3 degrees warmer than the 20th-century average, according to
the center. Only 2011 and 1936 had hotter summers, which
meteorologists mark from June 1 to Aug. 31, the center said in a
statement released today.  “The summer season was warmer-than-average for a large
portion of the contiguous  United States , with the exception of
the Southeast and parts of the Northwest, which were near or
slightly cooler than average,” the center said. “There were 16
states across the West, Plains and Upper Midwest which had
summer temperatures among their 10 highest. Colorado and  Wyoming 
each had their record-hottest summer.”  Summer heat contributed to the drought across the Midwest
that damaged corn and soybean crops, sending grain prices higher
for months. The heat also pushed natural gas prices up, after a
mild winter depressed them, as people in the large U.S. cities
turned to air conditioning to cool down.  To contact the reporter on this story:
