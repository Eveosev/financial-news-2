Bank of New York Mellon Corp.  lost
a bid to dismiss a lawsuit alleging it mishandled pension funds’
investments in Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. while persuading a
judge to narrow the claims in the case.  U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan in  Manhattan  today
ruled that a breach of contract claim can proceed, while
dismissing other claims he said are duplicative as well as an
allegation of breach of fiduciary duty.  “The court finds that plaintiffs have sufficiently pled a
claim for breach of contract,” Sullivan said in his order.  The plaintiffs, including the General Retirement System of
the City of  Detroit  and the Police & Fire Retirement System of
the City of Detroit, filed class-action, or group, complaints
last year. They allege that  BNY Mellon (BK)  encouraged them to join
its securities lending program, under which the bank would lend
securities owned by the funds to creditworthy borrowers.  The funds and other members of the class said the bank
invested in Lehman notes in 2006 on behalf of the funds and
continued to maintain the investments as uncertainty surrounding
Lehman grew. The plaintiffs said they lost more than $1 billion
in the notes.  “We’re pleased that the court dismissed three of the four
claims and we will vigorously defend against the lone remaining
claim,” Kevin Heine, a BNY Mellon spokesman, said in an e-mail.  The case is General Retirement System of the City of
Detroit v. BNY Mellon N.A., 11-06345, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
