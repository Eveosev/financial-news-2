A manager in  Minmetals Resources
Ltd. (1208) ’s parent company was fined S$100,000 ($80,850) for
breaching  Singapore ’s insider trading rules for trading in
equities related to his company and Equinox Minerals Ltd.  Shi Jiangtao knew of non-public materially price-sensitive
information of Hong Kong-listed Minmetal’s planned acquisition
of Equinox and traded in so-called contracts for differences of
the two firms, the Monetary Authority Singapore said in a
statement today.  Equinox, the target of a C$7 ($7.16) a share bid by
Minmetals, rose at least 29 percent on the Toronto and
Australian stock exchanges after the proposed takeover offer,
according to the statement. Minmetals, a unit of state-owned
China Minmetals Corp. had its offer in April 2011 for the copper
miner trumped by Toronto-based  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX)   “This case demonstrates the resolve of MAS in pursuing
insider trading perpetrators, including those residing overseas
or who trade in over-the-counter” products, said Lee Chuan Teck,
assistant managing director of  capital markets  at the regulator.  Shi’s trades were in his and his wife’s trading accounts at
CMC Markets Singapore and were later canceled, the capital
markets regulator said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
