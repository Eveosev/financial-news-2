Retail gasoline prices gained this
week by the least in two months and may have reached a peak
after catching up to a $19-a-barrel surge in crude costs.  The  national average  for regular gasoline climbed 0.4 cent
to $3.847 a gallon from a week earlier, the smallest increase
since prices began rising July 9, the U.S. Energy Information
Administration said in a report posted on its website yesterday.
Prices were up 5.1 percent from $3.661 a year earlier.  Retail  gasoline  has advanced 49 cents a gallon in the past
10 weeks, tracking  New York  crude futures that have risen 25
percent from the 2012 intraday low on speculation that European
and U.S. leaders will take measures to improve economic
conditions.  Oil prices  have been fluctuating around $95 a barrel
since mid-August, tempering the rise in retail prices.  “Gasoline prices have finally caught up with crude, and
they’ll stay where they are as long as crude does,”  David Hackett , the president of independent fuel consultant Stillwater
Associates in Irvine,  California , said by telephone yesterday.  Gasoline may actually start dropping this month as refiners
switch out of summer-grade gasoline production, Hackett said.  “The refineries can make more gasoline this time of year,
and that’ll take some of the steam out of the market,” he said.  Oil for October delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  was at $96.22 a barrel in electronic trading today.
Futures gained 12 cents to settle at $96.54 a barrel yesterday.
Prices fell as low as $77.28 on June 28.  Stockpile Decline  Crude stockpiles  dropped 7.43 million barrels, or 2
percent, to 357.1 million in the week ended Aug. 31, Energy
Department data show. They probably fell another 2.63 million
barrels to 354.5 million last week, according to the median of
eight analyst estimates before an Energy Department report
tomorrow.  Gasoline for October delivery on Nymex was little changed
at $3.0244 a gallon today. Futures climbed 0.44 cent, or 0.2
percent, to settle at $3.024 a gallon yesterday.  Motor-gasoline inventories declined 2.33 million barrels,
or 1.2 percent, to 198.9 million in the week ended Aug. 31, the
Energy Department said. They probably fell 1.65 million barrels
to 197.2 million last week, the Bloomberg survey shows.  Retail gasoline in the  Gulf Coast  dropped for the first
time in ten weeks, declining 0.4 cent to $3.641 a gallon. Prices
also fell in the Midwest, by 1.5 cents to $3.860 a gallon.
Gasoline in the Rocky Mountain region rose the most, gaining 5.8
cents to $3.698 a gallon, the energy agency’s report showed.  Sinclair Oil Corp.’s 25,500-barrel-a-day Casper refinery in
 Wyoming  returned to normal operations Sept. 7 after a Sept. 2
 power failure  damaged the plant’s fluid catalytic cracker. The
company was also repairing a sulfur unit at the 85,000-barrel-a-
day Wyoming refinery near Rawlins following a power failure on
Aug. 16, a company spokesman said by e-mail Sept. 7.  The Energy Department conducts a telephone survey of 800
retail gasoline outlets across the U.S. to post weekly prices.  To contact the reporters on this story:
