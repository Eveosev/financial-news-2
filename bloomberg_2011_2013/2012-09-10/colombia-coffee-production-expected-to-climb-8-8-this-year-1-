Colombia , the second-largest
supplier of Arabica coffee beans, said production will rise at
least 8.8 percent this year as drier weather aids the crop.  The nation will harvest 8.5 million bags or more of the
beans, compared with 7.8 million bags last year,  Colombia’s
National Federation of Coffee Growers  said today. Agriculture
Minister Juan Camilo Restrepo forecast output of about 9 million
bags yesterday on broadcaster  Caracol Radio .  Colombia is anticipating a recovery in production after an
end to above-average rainfall that drove the 2011 harvest to a
35-year low. This year’s harvest will fall short of 11.5 million
bags reached in 2008, before crop disease and wet weather
reduced output. The annual harvest may surpass 12 million bags
in coming years, Restrepo said.  He forecast output this year of as much as 9.5 million bags
on Sept. 2. In August, coffee production rose 21 percent to
565,000 bags from 466,000 bags a year earlier. Exports jumped 56
percent to 599,000 bags from 384,000 bags, according to the
Bogota-based federation.  Each bag of coffee weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds). Brazil
is the largest supplier of Arabica coffee, favored by specialty
brewers such as  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
