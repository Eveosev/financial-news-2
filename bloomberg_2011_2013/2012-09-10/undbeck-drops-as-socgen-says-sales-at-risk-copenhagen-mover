H. Lundbeck A/S (LUN)  fell to the lowest
price in nine months in Copenhagen trading after Societe
Generale SA said the Nordic region’s second-largest drugmaker
needs acquisitions to reach revenue goals.  Lundbeck fell as much as 2.2 percent to 104.90 kroner, the
lowest since Dec. 22, 2011. The stock declined 2.1 percent to
105 kroner at 1:26 p.m. making it  today’s biggest loser  in the
 OMX Copenhagen 20 index. (KFX)   Lundbeck is focusing on developing new drugs as patents on
its bestselling anti-depressant, sold under the brand names
Cipralex and Lexapro, expire. SocGen cut its recommendation
today to hold from buy and said the Copenhagen-based drugmaker
will have to acquire new medicines to sustain sales because its
experimental drug Desmoteplase probably won’t reach the market.
The bank said it hasn’t attached any value to the stroke
treatment in its assessment of Lundbeck’s stock.  “Given the forecast revenue profile for the group, in our
view, further in-licensing or acquisitions are needed to sustain
revenue and profit growth over the long term,” Stephen McGarry,
a London-based analyst with SocGen, said in the note. The bank
lowered its  share price estimate  to 114 kroner from 135 kroner.  Lundbeck repeated on Aug. 8 a 2012 revenue forecast of as
much as 15.2 billion kroner ($2.61 billion) and a target for
earnings before interest and tax of as much as 2.5 billion
kroner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
