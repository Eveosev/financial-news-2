The discovery of a two-month-old
baby’s body increased to 62 the death toll from the sinking of a
boat carrying migrants from  Turkey  to Europe, the Anatolia news
agency reported.  The boat capsized off Turkey’s Aegean cost on Sept. 6, the
semi-official agency reported, citing local authorities. A
further 46 people were rescued, it said.  Most of the dead were Palestinians, Anatolia said after the
accident.  To contact the reporter on this story:
