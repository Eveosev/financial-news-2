Asian currencies rallied, led by
the  Thai baht , as U.S. jobs data fanned speculation the  Federal
Reserve  will announce a third round of quantitative easing, a
policy that boosts the supply of dollars.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia  Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s currencies, traded near the highest level since May
after a Sept. 7 report showed American payrolls increased 96,000
in August, less than the 130,000 gain forecast in a Bloomberg
survey of economists. The Fed concludes a two-day meeting this
week to consider if more monetary easing is needed to support
the world’s largest economy. Ten-year  government bonds  yield
3.04 percent in South Korea and 3.43 percent in  China , compared
with 1.66 percent in the U.S.  “The employment data were disappointing and that led to
speculation of a third round of easing, supporting regional
currencies,” said Disawat Tiaowvanich, a foreign-exchange
trader at  Bangkok Bank Pcl. (BBL)  “It’s a capital-inflow outlook
story as  interest rates  here are higher.”  The baht strengthened 0.4 percent to 31.10 per dollar as of
4:08 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Taiwan’s dollar advanced 0.3 percent to NT$29.740 and South
Korea’s won gained 0.1 percent to 1,129.36. The Philippine peso
rose 0.1 percent to 41.618, and touched a four-year high of
41.548 earlier.  Global funds bought $627 million more Indonesian, South
Korean, and Taiwanese stocks than they sold on Sept. 7,
according to the latest exchange data.  Slowdown Signs  Asian currencies also appreciated on speculation policy
makers in the region will boost efforts to revive growth.  China’s imports unexpectedly fell 2.6 percent in August
from a year earlier, official data showed today, compared with a
3.5 percent increase that economists in a Bloomberg survey
predicted. Japan’s gross domestic product expanded in the second
quarter at half the pace the government initially estimated,
according to figures released today.  Taiwan’s exports slumped 4.2 percent in August from a year
earlier, a sixth month of contraction, official data showed last
week. Malaysia’s overseas shipments declined 1.9 percent in
July, and Indonesia’s fell 7.3 percent.  “The big picture now is that economic conditions for
emerging countries, and Asia in particular, are continuing to
deteriorate,” said Dariusz Kowalczyk, senior economist and
strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in  Hong Kong . “But outlook
for the markets is improving as investors are taking the
weakness as an indication of more decisive policy support.”  Peso at 2008 High  The peso added to a three-week rally and reached the
strongest level since April 2008 after the central bank said it
may raise inflation targets for 2012 and 2013, signaling policy
makers may pause after three interest-rate cuts in 2012.  Standard & Poor’s  raised the Philippines debt rating to
BB+, one step below investment grade, in July, citing the strong
external position and growth prospects. Moody’s Investor
Service, which still ranks the $225 billion economy at the
second-highest junk level, boosted its outlook to positive in
May, while  Fitch Ratings  raised its assessment to one step below
investment grade last year.  “The peso is definitely benefiting from inflows of foreign
money,” said Jose Vistan, head of research at AB Capital
Securities Ltd. in Manila. “There’s also increased confidence
in the Philippine economy, with the possibility of a rating
upgrade.”  Elsewhere, China’s  yuan  appreciated 0.09 percent to 6.3376
per dollar, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. Malaysia’s ringgit and Indonesia’s rupiah each climbed
0.1 percent to 3.1032 and 9,578, respectively. India’s rupee and
Vietnam’s dong were little changed at 55.3875 and 20,850,
respectively.  To contact the reporters on this story:
