The Philippine peso touched the
strongest level in more than four years after U.S. employment
data prompted speculation the  Federal Reserve  will add to
monetary-easing measures, boosting demand for riskier assets.  Payrolls in the world’s largest economy rose by 96,000 last
month, compared with the 130,000 median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey and the 141,000 jobs created in July, the Labor
Department said on Sept. 7. The local currency extended a three-
week rally after the Philippine central bank said it may raise
inflation targets for 2012 and 2013, and economists forecast
policy makers will keep  interest rates  at record low this week.  “The peso is definitely benefiting from inflows of foreign
money into equities” given the speculation on monetary easing
by the Fed, said Jose Vistan, head of research at AB Capital
Securities Ltd. in  Manila . “There’s also increased confidence
in the Philippine economy, with the possibility of a rating
upgrade.”  The peso gained 0.1 percent to 41.618 per dollar as of 4:22
p.m. in Manila, data from Tullett Prebon Plc showed. It reached
41.548 earlier, the highest level since April 2008. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, was little changed at 5.7 percent.  Foreign investors bought $17 million of local shares last
week, taking this year’s net purchases to $2.12 billion,
according to stock exchange data.  Rate Outlook  The country was upgraded one level to Ba2 by Moody’s
Investors Service in June last year, or two levels below
investment grade.  Standard & Poor’s  raised its rating one step
to BB+ on July 4 this year, or one level below investment grade.  The currency pared gain before a government report tomorrow
that may show exports shrank 2 percent in July following a 4.3
percent advance in June, based on the median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey. Malaysia, Thailand and  Taiwan  also reported
contraction in July shipments.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas will keep its overnight rate at
 3.75 percent  on Sept. 13, according to 15 of 20 economists in a
separate survey. Five predicted a cut to 3.5 percent.  Monetary
policy  remains appropriate while the economy faces significant
issues related to higher commodity prices, Deputy Governor Diwa
Guinigundo said on Sept. 8.  The yield on the 4.875 percent bond due August 2022 dropped
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 4.8 percent,
according to Tradition Financial Services.  The treasury will auction 9 billion pesos ($216 million) of
10-year bonds tomorrow. It last sold 2022 notes on July 31 at an
average yield of 4.83 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
