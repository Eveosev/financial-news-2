Falkland Oil & Gas Ltd. (FOGL) , an
explorer in the South Atlantic, fell the most in two years in
 London  following drilling delays at its Loligo prospect.  Falkland Oil slumped 26 percent to 67.25 pence for the
biggest decline since July 2010 after saying drilling is about
five days behind schedule because of work to reinforce the well.  The company has had to run an “additional string of casing
in the top section,” it said today in a statement. “No
abnormal pressures have been encountered during the drilling of
the well and all operations have been conducted without issue.”  The Loligo well has been drilled to 3,900 meters (12,800
feet) and will reach targeted depth within 24 hours, the London-
based company said in the statement.  Oil explorers are targeting 8.3 billion barrels in waters
around the islands off  Argentina  this year, three times the
U.K.’s reserves. Falkland Oil has secured a partnership with
 Noble Energy Inc. (NBL)  and  Edison International (EIX)  SpA to share the
costs and risks of drilling off the archipelago that  Margaret
Thatcher  went to war to keep British in 1982.  To contact the reporter on this story:
