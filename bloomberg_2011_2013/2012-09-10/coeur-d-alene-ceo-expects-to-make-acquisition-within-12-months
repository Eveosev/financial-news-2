Coeur d’Alene Mines Corp. , a U.S.
silver producer, will probably make an acquisition in the next
12 months, Chief Executive Officer Mitchell Krebs said.  Coeur, which operates mines in  Argentina ,  Bolivia ,  Mexico 
and the U.S., will consider deals of as much as $250 million and
assets that can produce about 3 million to 4 million ounces a
year of silver, Krebs said today in an interview in Denver,
where he’s attending the  Denver Gold Forum .  “In a year from now we will have grown externally,” Krebs
said. The company is seeking acquisitions that are
“incremental, bite-sized, strategic, accretive and with an
attractive rate of return,” he said. “It’s not just growth for
growth’s sake.”  The company, based in Coeur d’Alene,  Idaho , is also seeking
to increase production from its operations, he said. Krebs said
he’s focused in “pro-mining” regions and mainly in areas where
the company already operates.  “We have invested a lot in junior companies,” he said.
“We have ownership interests in eight different small-cap
companies that have projects that we are interested in and
like.”  Coeur has bought about $10 million worth of its own shares
as part of a $100 million share-repurchase program, the company
said Sept. 7. The miner expects to produce at the high end of
its 2012 forecast of 18.5 million to 20 million ounces of silver
and 210,000 to 230,000 ounces of gold, Krebs said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
