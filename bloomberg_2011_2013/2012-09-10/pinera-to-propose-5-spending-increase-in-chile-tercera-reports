Chile’s government will propose a
public spending increase of about 5 percent over this year’s
levels for the 2013 budget, Santiago-based newspaper La Tercera
 reported today , citing President Sebastian Pinera.  The increase would be in line with estimates for economic
growth in 2013, the newspaper reported. The budget, which will
be presented to Congress by the end of this month, will
prioritize education, health care, science and technology as
well as reducing poverty and improving public safety, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
