New Zealand ’s central bank should
hold the official cash rate at a record-low 2.5 percent at the
Sept. 13 meeting, according to the majority of a nine-member
panel of economists, academics and company executives.  Seven of the so-called shadow board set up by the New
Zealand Institute of Economic Research Inc. said Governor Alan Bollard should leave the rate unchanged, the Wellington-based
institute said in an e-mailed statement. Two members preferred a
rate cut.  All 16 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News  predicted no
change in borrowing costs until next year, with a majority
seeing the first rate increase in the second quarter. There is a
46 percent chance of a rate cut this year, according to
 interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The board is highly supportive of leaving  interest rates 
at 2.5 percent but if there was to be a move, a cut would be
more appropriate than a hike,” Kirdan Lees, an economist at the
institute, said in the statement.  The shadow board members indicate where they think interest
rates should be, not what they expect will happen, the institute
said. New Zealand’s official cash rate hasn’t been changed since
March 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
