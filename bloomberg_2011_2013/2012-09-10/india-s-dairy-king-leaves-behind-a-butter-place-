India mourned the demise on Sept. 9 of  Dr. Verghese Kurien , whose pioneering work at the intersection of dairy-farming technology, the cooperative sector, and branding and marketing created one of the nation's greatest business success stories. Kurien, who died at 90, was a revolutionary in the dairy sector, and the brand that he created,  Amul , today enjoys more name recognition and goodwill than almost any other. Kurien was also the brain behind  Operation Flood , a massive undertaking that began in 1970 and lasted almost three decades, designed to develop a countrywide milk grid that would solve milk  scarcity problems -- a reality of the mid-20th century that is unknown to most young Indians today -- and make the nation the largest milk producer in the world. Through his work and vision, dairying became  "India’s largest self-sustainable rural employment program ." Somewhat like the economist  Muhammad Yunus  in  Bangladesh , who devised a microfinance model to encourage the entrepreneurial talents of the poor, Kurien helped generate long-term wealth. He linked the small Indian farmer, with one or two cows or buffaloes, to a huge network of milk collection that worked on a cooperative model and returned to the producer much of the sale price of the milk. Most of Kurien's early work was done in Gujarat, a western state with  a long history of mass involvement with the cooperative sector . The dairy brand  Amul , now more than 50 years old and with annual revenue of about $2 billion, is the brand name of Gujarat Co-Operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) -- or,  as Kurien was proud of saying , "the brand name of 2 million farmers, members of 10,000 village dairy cooperative societies throughout Gujarat." Describing the strengths of Kurien's model of dairy farming,  the economist MS Sriram wrote : Kurien's work in villages, with small-scale producers, and in branding is now the subject of hundreds of case studies in business schools. Among the many successful institutions that he set up is  the Institute of Rural Management (IRMA) in Anand, Gujarat,  which aims to produce "rural managers" to professionalize the development of  India 's rural sector. Reflecting on Kurien's legacy, the economist Yoginder Alagh  wrote in the Indian Express : And in 2007, the year after Kurien retired from GCMMF, the magazine  Business Today said : Among the many surprising journeys on which Kurien took the dairy farmers of Gujarat was one into film production, with " Manthan" ("The Churning") . The film -- to my mind one of the great Indian productions because of its unusual theme, its mixture of idealism and realism and its origins -- featured a story set around the cooperative dairy movement. It was meant to communicate a sense of the movement's pleasures, struggles and potential for creating lasting change through a form that would reach a wider audience than the standard documentary. It was made by the legendary Indian director Shyam Benegal, and what was most unusual about it was that it was funded entirely by the dairy farmers of Gujarat.  Benegal recalled : Kurien was to present his own version of these experiences in  an autobiography  called "I Too Had a Dream." It was to include the strange story of how, as a young man in his twenties, he arrived in Gujarat with an assignment in a government creamery even though his technical training was in metallurgy. In  an essay  for the Indian magazine Seminar in 2001, Kurien wrote about the Amul brand and the cooperative movement: The relationship with Amul is one that Indian people renew whenever they buy the company's butter, milk, ice-cream or other dairy products. But it is also kept up through the brand's  signature advertising campaign , a tongue-in-cheek series  of tableaux on current Indian affairs  linking back in some way (usually through a pun) to Amul butter, that is now one of the world's oldest advertising campaigns. This week, a picture in the spirit of the Amul ad campaigns did the rounds on Twitter, thanking Kurien  "for leaving India a butter place."
