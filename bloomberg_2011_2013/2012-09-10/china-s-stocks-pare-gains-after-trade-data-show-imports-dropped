China ’s stocks pared gains after a
report showed imports declined last month, while exports grew
less than economists had estimated.  The Shanghai Composite Index was little changed at 11:07
a.m. local time, while the CSI 300 Index added 0.2 percent. The
Shanghai gauge was up as much as 0.4 percent earlier, while the
CSI 300 had risen 0.7 percent.  China’s exports rose 2.7 percent in August from a year
earlier, compared with the median estimate of 2.9 percent
according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Imports dropped
2.6 percent, compared with a forecast increase of 3.5 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
