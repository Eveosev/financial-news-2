Oman’s  benchmark stock index 
climbed to the highest level in more than two months amid
speculation this year’s decline is overdone given prospects for
corporate earnings.  National Aluminium Production (NAPI) , which exports to Germany,
the U.K. and Singapore, advanced to the highest intraday level
in almost a week.  Galfar Engineering & Contracting SAOG (GECS) , a
construction company, headed for the highest close since June
28. The  MSM30 Index (MSM30)  gained for a seventh day, rising 0.1 percent
to 5,596.65, the highest intraday level since July 3, at 11:43
a.m. in Muscat. The Bloomberg GCC 200 Index fell 0.1 percent.  Oman’s benchmark has declined 1.7 percent this year,
leaving the 30 companies trading at an average  9.8 times 
estimated earnings. That’s lower than Dubai, Saudi Arabia and
Qatar and compares with 10.9 times for the MSCI Emerging Markets
Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Dubai’s measure
has gained 15 percent this year, while Saudi’s index is up 11
percent.  “Oman has underperformed for quite some time in terms of
overall activity and it was attractive,” said Kanaga Sundar,
head of research at Gulf Baader Capital Markets SAOC in Muscat.  National Aluminium surged 3.6 percent to 0.233 rial, the
highest intraday level since Sept. 4. Galfar gained 0.8 percent
to 0.392 rial, extending its rally for the year to 16 percent.  Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  fell 0.6 percent and Kuwait’s
measure dropped 0.5 percent.  Abu Dhabi ’s ADX General Index added
0.2 percent, while Bahrain’s gauge and Qatar’s climbed 0.3
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
