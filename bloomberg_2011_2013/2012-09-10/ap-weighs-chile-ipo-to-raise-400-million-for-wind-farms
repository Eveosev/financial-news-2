Latin America Power , an energy
startup backed by Brazilian billionaire  Andre Esteves , is
considering an initial public offering in Santiago as it seeks
to raise $400 million for projects in Chile,  Peru  and Panama.  LAP, which plans to raise the funds within two years to
develop hydroelectric dams and wind farms in the three
countries, is also considering tapping private investors and
existing shareholders for the capital, Chief Executive Officer
Roberto Sahade said in an interview in Santiago today. The
Santiago-based company is backed by Esteves’s  Banco BTG Pactual
SA (BBTG11)  and Brazilian investment funds Patria Investimentos SA,
Promon SA and GMR Energia.  The company is targeting Chile and Peru as copper- and
gold-mining investments will boost power demand, while Panama’s
economic growth has strained existing electricity supplies,
Sahade said.  “This growth requires energy,” Sahade said. “It’s a
fantastic opportunity for us.”  LAP plans to generate 1 gigawatt of power in the three
countries by 2018, according to a company presentation. The
three countries have similar legal frameworks that govern power
investments, Sahade said. The company currently has 33.4
megawatts of generating capacity and is developing another 180
megawatts.  Sahade is a former CEO of Brazilian renewable energy
company ERSA-Energias Renovaveis SA. CPFL Energia SA,  Brazil ’s
largest private-sector power distributor, merged its renewable
energy units with ERSA last year to create  CPFL Energias
Renovaveis SA. (CPFE3)   To contact the reporter on this story:
