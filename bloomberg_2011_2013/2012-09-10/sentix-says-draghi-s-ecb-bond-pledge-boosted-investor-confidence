European investor confidence rose
in September after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi 
pledged to buy bonds of countries suffering the effects of the
debt crisis, the Sentix research institute said.  An index measuring sentiment in the euro-area economy
increased to minus 23.2 from minus 30.3 in August, the Limburg,
Germany-based institute said in an e-mailed statement today.
That’s the first increase since March. Economists had forecast
confidence to slip to minus 30.5, the median of 11 estimates in
a Bloomberg News survey shows.  Draghi last week announced an unlimited bond-purchase
program to regain control of  interest rates  in the euro area and
fight speculation of a currency breakup. It is now up to the
governments in countries such as Spain and Italy to trigger ECB
bond purchases by requesting aid from  Europe ’s rescue fund and
signing up to conditions.  “Draghi’s carefully-conditioned bazooka has obviously
charmed investors,”  Sebastian Wanke , a senior analyst at Sentix
said in the statement. “The expectations index for all surveyed
countries and regions rose strongly in September, the most in
Europe but also very clearly for the U.S., eastern Europe and
Asia excluding  Japan .”  A gauge of expectations in the euro area’s economy rose to
minus 10.8, while a measure of current conditions increased to
minus 34.8. Sentix said 812 investors were surveyed Sept. 6-8.
