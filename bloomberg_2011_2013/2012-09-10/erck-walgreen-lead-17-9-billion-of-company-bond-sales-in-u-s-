Merck & Co. (MRK)  and  Walgreen Co. (WAG)  are
leading borrowers selling $17.9 billion of corporate bonds in
the U.S. today.  Merck, the maker of Claritin, raised $2.5 billion of debt
in three parts in its first sale since 2010 and Deerfield,
Illinois-based Walgreen issued $4 billion of bonds linked to its
acquisition of a stake in Alliance Boots Holdings Ltd.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales compare with
$18.6 billion on Sept. 4, the busiest day for dollar-denominated
sales in almost six months.  Issuers are selling bonds ahead of a meeting this week by
the U.S. Federal Reserve, where policy makers may announce
further quantitative easing. Companies are timing the market to
obtain record-low  interest rates  as they capitalize on high
demand ahead of potential volatility, according to Rob Crimmins,
a  money manager  in New York at RS Investments, which oversees
$30 billion.  Borrowers are looking at the level of rates and taking the
opportunity to issue, Crimmins said in a telephone interview.
“There’s still strong demand technically for the corporate
markets.”  Yields on debt from the most creditworthy to the riskiest
borrowers reached 3.837 percent on Sept. 7, a record low,
according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate &
High Yield Master index. The extra yield investors demand to own
corporate bonds rather than government debentures fell to 259
basis points.  Today’s sales will help boost this month’s offerings to
more than $57.5 billion, Bloomberg data show.  Merck Offering  Merck sold $1 billion each of 5.5-year, 1.1 percent notes
