Angola ,  Africa â€™s second-largest oil
producer, reduced electricity generation at the Capanda Dam that
helps power the capital as a drought cut Kwanza River water
levels, the state-owned Jornal de Angola reported.  The dam is producing 240 megawatts, compared with a
capacity of 520 megawatts, the paper said, citing Eurico
Ferreira, director of the Kwanza power authority. Production
should increase from the end of next month after seasonal rains
begin, he said. The project sends 80 percent of its power about
300 kilometers (185 miles) northwest to the capital, Luanda,
which suffers daily blackouts, Ferreira said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
