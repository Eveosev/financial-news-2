Two German plaintiffs trying to
stop the euro region’s future permanent bailout fund said they
expect the nation’s highest court to set limits on  Germany ’s
liabilities and tie its approval to popular consent.  “I think the judges once again will harden the budgetary
sovereignty rights and somehow hedge the financial burdens for
Germany,” economist Joachim Starbatty said today on Phoenix
public television.  Former German Justice Minister Herta Daeubler-Gmelin,
another plaintiff, said she hopes that shifting rights away from
Germany’s lower house of parliament will only be allowed after
the country’s voters have approved it or the European Parliament
has been given more competencies.  The Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe, Germany, is
due to rule on Sept. 12 on the plaintiffs’ challenge to the
European Stability Mechanism. The 500 billion-euro ($639
billion) ESM, designed to bail out indebted euro-area member
states, is a cornerstone of efforts to save the currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
