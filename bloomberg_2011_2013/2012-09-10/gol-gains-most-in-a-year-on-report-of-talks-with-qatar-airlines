Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4) 
jumped the most in a month after a report that it’s in talks
with  Qatar Airways  Ltd. added to speculation the Brazilian
carrier is planning an asset sale or merger to lower the
industry’s highest debt levels.  Shares gained 5.5 percent to 9.90 reais at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, the steepest advance since Aug. 8. The
benchmark  Bovespa index  added 0.1 percent.  Gol’s directors met with executives of Qatar Airways on
Sept. 4, Veja reported on its Radar On-Line column, without
saying where it got the information. The Brazilian carrier’s
press office denied the company is in talks with Qatar to sell
the business. A Qatar Airways spokesman declined to comment when
contacted by  Bloomberg News .  A $1.6 billion debt load, the most of any major airline
worldwide relative to profit, has fueled speculation that Gol
will sell assets to raise cash or merge with another carrier.  “In tough times such as those we’re facing, investors see
it as a natural step for Gol to join forces with a bigger
airline,” Sandro Fernandes, an analyst at brokerage Geraldo
Correa, said by phone from  Belo Horizonte , Brazil. The strategy
would be similar to competitor Tam SA’s merger with Lan Airlines
SA in June, which created the world’s largest airline by market
value, he said.  Gol’s shares have lost 20 percent  this year , while the
Bovespa rose 2.9 percent during the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
