Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) , the world’s largest personal-computer maker, expanded the total job cuts under its reorganization plan announced in May to 29,000, more than it had originally  disclosed .  The cuts, exceeding the 27,000 estimated earlier, will take place through fiscal year 2014, Hewlett-Packard said today in a regulatory filing. The company said it will book reorganization expenses of about $3.7 billion during the period.  Hewlett-Packard is grappling with slower demand for printers, services and data-center equipment. The company said in May that it will fire workers and make early retirement offers to generate annual savings of as much as $3.5 billion starting in 2014. Many cuts will take place in the ailing enterprise services group, which manages data centers and provides information-technology consulting.  “It’s more than they said last time, but who’s to say it’s not going to get higher if things get worse?,” said  Brian White , an analyst at Topeka Capital Markets in  New York , in a telephone interview. “They’ve got a lot of wood to chop, and this is a long-term turnaround story.”  Hewlett-Packard rose less than 1 percent to $17.43 at the close in New York. The shares have declined 32 percent this year.  The company last month said it would write down the value of its enterprise-services business by about $8 billion. As part of restructuring, the unit will lose approximately 8,000 positions, including 7,300 eliminated as of July 31, Hewlett- Packard said in the filing today.  Former Chief Executive Officer  Mark Hurd  pushed into enterprise services with the $13.2 billion purchase of Electronic Data Systems Corp. in 2008.
