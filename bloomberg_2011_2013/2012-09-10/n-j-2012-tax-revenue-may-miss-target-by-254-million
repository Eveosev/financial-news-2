New Jersey tax receipts fell $254
million short of Governor  Chris Christie ’s fiscal 2012 budget
forecast, according to a nonpartisan report on year-end figures.  The 12-month total through June was $25.4 billion, or about
0.8 percent less than the $25.6 billion estimated by Treasurer
Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff in May,  David Rosen , the Legislature’s
chief budget officer, said yesterday in a memo. He said revenue
from 14 major tax sources rose 2.9 percent from fiscal 2011.  Christie, 50, dismissed the memo as “blatantly
political,” in comments to reporters in Haddonfield. The first-
term Republican said some receipts still haven’t been counted,
and that the budget officer’s figures aren’t credible. A report
from Rosen last month said collections were as much as $540
million less than targeted.  “The Democrats want to continue playing these political
games and justifying their unwillingness to give tax relief to
people,” Christie said. The party controls the Legislature.  The figures from Rosen, which reflect year-end accounting
adjustments, aren’t official until the state’s Comprehensive
Annual Financial Report comes out later this year. Rosen said
that while some revenue still hasn’t been counted, the figures
in his report make up about 88 percent of all receipts.  The governor has traveled the state touting a “Jersey
Comeback,” an economic-recovery plan that includes tax relief.
Democrats didn’t include levy rollbacks in the $31.7 billion
fiscal 2013 budget, as they weren’t certain whether revenue
would meet the governor’s targets, according to party leaders.  Budget Surplus  Christie’s plan projected a surplus of more than $600
million in the current fiscal year, which began July 1.  Assemblyman Vincent Prieto, a Democrat from Secaucus who
leads that chamber’s budget panel, said Rosen’s figures showed
“a disconcerting trend.”  “The shortfall means this year’s budget starts with $254
million less than anticipated, requiring even higher growth than
was already assumed by Governor Christie to meet his targets,”
Prieto said in a statement. “Unfortunately, we have yet to see
any signs of such a so-called comeback, despite the constant
spin that budget shortfalls have been tackled.”  Income-tax receipts, at $11.1 billion, were $208.7 million
more than estimated. Sales levies produced about $7.95 billion,
or $99 million less than projected in May.  “This revenue significantly underperformed expectations
during the last three months of the fiscal year,” Rosen said of
the  sales tax . Receipts from it rose 2.3 percent from 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
