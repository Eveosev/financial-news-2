Audi AG (NSU)  trimmed  Bayerische Motoren
Werke AG (BMW) ’s lead in 2012 luxury-car sales to just 2,110 vehicles
in August, threatening BMW’s seven-year hold on the top position
in premium auto deliveries.  The  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  luxury brand boosted eight-month sales 13
percent to 961,000 vehicles, compared with BMW’s 7.8 percent
increase to 963,110 autos, according to the two companies’
monthly sales reports. BMW, the world’s largest-maker of luxury
cars, led by 40,513 vehicles through August of last year.  VW is reaping the benefits from pouring 20 billion euros
($25.6 billion) into research and development at Audi since
2002. The  luxury brand  now sells 12 model lines, twice what it
had in 2003, including three sport-utility vehicles, the A1
compact and the R8 sports car. Audi, which ranks second in
premium-vehicle deliveries since overtaking  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s
Mercedes-Benz in 2011, has a goal of beating BMW by 2020.  Audi is likely to overtake BMW several years ahead of that
target unless “there are surprising shifts in market share
which I don’t expect, especially in  China ,” said  Daniel Schwarz , a Frankfurt-based Commerzbank analyst. “They are the
strongest growing luxury brand, and they just launched the A3,
which is close to being their best-selling car in a peak year.”  The updated A3 hatchback went on sale in  Germany  in August,
three weeks ahead of Mercedes’ A-Class. Mercedes plans to expand
its lineup of compacts from two to at least five in the coming
years, and has opened a new plant in  Hungary  dedicated to
building smaller models. The A3, which made up 14 percent of
Audi’s 2011 deliveries, starts at 21,600 euros, undercutting the
A-Class’s base price of 23,978 euros.  Audi Momentum  “There will be more A-Class derivatives over the coming
years,” said Commerzbank’s Schwarz. “But the A3 is established
in the market and will take the lead among the three brands,
helping Audi to keep its sales momentum.”  Volkswagen  advanced  70 cents, or 0.5 percent, to 142 euros
in Frankfurt trading today. Munich-based BMW gained 0.9 percent
to 58.53 euros, while Daimler fell 0.8 percent to 38.77 euros.  The 102,730 vehicles BMW sold in August fell short of the
108,100 sold by Audi, which also passed the BMW brand in
deliveries in April and July. The VW unit’s delivery growth was
led by jumps so far this year of 33 percent in China and 18
percent in the U.S., the world’s two biggest auto markets.  “Every month the figures are surprisingly good,” said
Frankfurt-based Silvia Quandt analyst  Albrecht Denninghoff , who
rates VW neutral. “Audi’s growth is overwhelmingly because of
China, with the U.S. also playing a role.”  Chinese Growth  BMW has been slower to capitalize on growth in the Chinese
market than Audi, which has built cars in Changchun as part of a
joint venture with First Automobile Works since 1996. BMW is now
quadrupling its Chinese production capacity, having started
manufacturing with partner  Brilliance China Automotive Holdings
Ltd. (1114)  in 2003.  Surging China sales have helped Ingolstadt, Germany-based
Audi double deliveries in the last 10 years, and the luxury
brand now accounts for 47 percent of group operating profit.  Mercedes-Benz and BMW are both considering following Audi
in setting up production in  Mexico  for the U.S. market, Carlos Guzman, head of ProMexico, said in an interview last month.
Mercedes and BMW, unlike Audi, already have U.S. factories.  Audi will invest $1.3 billion in a plant in the state of
Puebla to produce the Q5 SUV. The plant is scheduled to open in
2016 with an annual capacity of 150,000 vehicles.  “The new factory will help Audi in the U.S.,” Denninghoff
said. “The 150,000 cars that will come there can certainly
compensate for slowing growth in China.”  BMW is expecting to regain some sales momentum with the
arrival of the wagon version of its 3-Series executive car in
showrooms this month. The derivative usually accounts for two-
thirds of 3-Series registrations in Germany, the carmaker said
last week.  BMW has held the luxury-car sales lead since 2005, when it
passed Stuttgart, Germany-based Mercedes to nab the top spot.
Mercedes last year fell to third in global deliveries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
