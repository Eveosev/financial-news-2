ZTE Corp. (763) , China’s second-largest
maker of phone equipment, denied media reports that it won part
of an order from China Mobile Communications Corp. for handsets
after its shares rose the most in more than a month.  The company won part of China Mobile’s first tender for
fourth-generation handsets, valued at several billion  yuan ,
along with Huawei Technologies Co. and  China Wireless
Technologies Ltd. (2369) , the  Apple Daily  reported today, citing
affiliate Sharp Daily.  “The report is not accurate,” Rena Qin, a spokeswoman for
Shenzhen-based ZTE, said by phone today. She declined to comment
further, referring queries to China Mobile. Zhang Xuan, a
Beijing-based spokesman for the carrier, said in an e-mail
additional information wasn’t immediately available.  ZTE rose 6.3 percent, the most since Aug. 7, to close at
HK$10.42 in Hong Kong. Prior to the company’s denial, the shares
had risen as much as 7.1 percent. They have  dropped  57 percent
this year, compared with a 7.6 percent gain in the city’s
benchmark Hang Seng Index.  ZTE began selling its first 4G handset, the Grand X LTE
(T82), last month through the carrier’s Hong Kong-listed unit,
 China Mobile Ltd. (941)   ZTE has said it plans to double smartphone sales this year.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
