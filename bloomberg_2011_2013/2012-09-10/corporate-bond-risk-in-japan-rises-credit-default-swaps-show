The cost of protecting corporate
bonds in  Japan  from default rose, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index increased 1 basis point to
199 as of 9:24 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices show. The
benchmark fell 14 basis points last week, its biggest decline
since the five days ended June 15, according to CMA, which is
owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers
in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 1 basis point to 149
as of 10:39 a.m. in Sydney, according to  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) 
The index dropped 21 basis points last week, its biggest weekly
decrease since the first week of December, according to CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 133.5 basis points
as of 8:08 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. The gauge fell 20 basis points last week, its
biggest weekly drop since March, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
