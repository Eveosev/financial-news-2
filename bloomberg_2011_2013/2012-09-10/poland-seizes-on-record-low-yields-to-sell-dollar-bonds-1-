Poland  sold $2 billion of new
benchmark dollar bonds today, tapping the U.S. market for the
second time this year after its borrowing costs fell to a
record.  The notes maturing in March 2023 were priced to yield 150
basis points more than the equivalent U.S. Treasuries, down
from intial guidance of 165, according to a person familiar with
the offering who asked not to be named because terms aren’t
finalized yet. The yield on 10-year securities in dollars that
the government last sold in January fell to a record of 3
percent on Sept. 7, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Poland has financed this year’s borrowing early on 
concern the  European debt crisis  may shut markets for the 
country, which relies on the euro area for most of its exports
and bank assets.  The government has financed 89 percent of debt needs this
year through August after selling bonds in zloty, dollars,
euros, the Swiss franc and the yen, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Poland plans to complete 2012 borrowing by the end
of October “at the latest,”  Piotr Marczak , head of the  Finance
Ministry ’s public debt department, said last month.  Amgen Inc. today joined Renault SA and five Spanish
borrowers to raise money in the busiest day for European bond
issuance in 2 1/2 years.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc, HSBC Holdings Plc and Deutsche
Bank AG managed the sale for Poland today, according to Marczak.  To contact the reporter on this story:
