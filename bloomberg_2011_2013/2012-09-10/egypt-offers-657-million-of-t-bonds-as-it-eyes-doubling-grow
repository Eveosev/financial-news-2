Egypt  will offer 4 billion Egyptian
pounds ($657 million) of treasury bonds today after the
government said it is looking to double economic growth in the
year that ends in June. The nation’s dollar bonds rose.  The Arab country will seek bids for 2 billion pounds of
 three-year securities , according to central bank data on
Bloomberg. It will also offer  seven-  and  10-year notes  valued at
1 billion pounds each. The country last sold debt maturing in
2022 on Aug. 13 at an average yield of 17.03 percent.  Egypt is targeting economic growth of 4 percent to 4.5
percent for the year that ends in June, Prime Minister Hisham
Qandil said in an interview yesterday before Finance Minister
Momtaz el-Saieed said the rate reached 2.2 percent in the last
fiscal year. Domestic debt yields are tumbling after the
government restarted loan talks with the  International Monetary
Fund  for $4.8 billion and attracted $2 billion in aid from
Qatar.  The pound, subject to a managed float, strengthened for a
fourth day, gaining less than 0.1 percent to 6.0893 a dollar at
12:22 p.m. in Cairo. The currency had weakened to 6.0184 a
dollar on Sept. 4, the lowest level since December 2004.  The yield on the  5.75 dollar bonds  due in 2020 retreated
one basis point, or 0.01 of a percentage point, to 5.32 percent,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest
level since January 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
