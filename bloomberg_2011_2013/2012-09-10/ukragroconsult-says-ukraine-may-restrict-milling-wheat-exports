Ukraine’s milling wheat exports may
be restricted next year if the current pace of shipments
continues, researcher  UkrAgroConsult  said.  About 4 million metric tons of milling wheat can be
exported in the marketing year that started July 1, according to
an agreement between the government and traders, the Kiev-based
researcher said today in an e-mailed note. The former Soviet
state has shipped 1.3 million tons in the first two months,
UkrAgroconsult said.  “Taking into account the estimate of port shipments,
Ukraine wheat export capacity could be depleted by the end of
2012 if the current export pace is preserved,” the researcher
said.  Ukraine limited grain exports in 2010 after dry weather
damaged the harvest. This year’s harvest forecast was
cut by 9.3 percent by UkrAgroConsult because wheat and corn
yields declined after a summer drought.  To contact the reporter on this story:
