Chile ’s peso appreciated to the
strongest in a month as copper rallied on prospects for economic
stimulus in  China .  The peso gained 0.1 percent to 475.15 per dollar at 2:30
p.m. in Santiago, the strongest closing level since Aug. 9. The
price of copper for December delivery rose 1.2 percent on the
Comex in  New York  to $3.6885 a pound.  Copper, Chile’s biggest export, gained on speculation that
Chinese authorities will try to stimulate faster growth after
industrial output rose at the slowest pace in three years in
August. China is the biggest buyer of Chilean copper. Chile’s
mining industry is “booming” and should help drive faster
economic growth next year, President Sebastian Pinera told
 Bloomberg News  in an interview yesterday.  “Copper will have to rise,” said Ronald Volpi, the head
of spot currency trading at EuroAmerica Corredores de Bolsa SA
in Santiago. “And with copper at $3.70 and everything else flat
there’s no reason for the peso to depreciate.”  Local investors  in the peso forwards market, a category
dominated by pension funds and excluding banks, cut their long
peso position to $15.8 billion on Sept. 6, the lowest since May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
