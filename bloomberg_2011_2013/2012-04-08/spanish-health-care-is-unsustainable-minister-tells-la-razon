The Spanish health-care system is
currently “unsustainable,” Minister Ana Mato told newspaper  La
Razon  in an interview.  The government will create an agency to assess which drugs
and services are efficient, La Razon cited Mato as saying. The
quality of service will be the only criteria, not cost, and
cheap drugs will still be covered by the tax-funded system, Mato
said.  The government will guarantee a system that remains free
for patients and doesn’t lead to unpaid bills for suppliers, the
minister told the paper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
