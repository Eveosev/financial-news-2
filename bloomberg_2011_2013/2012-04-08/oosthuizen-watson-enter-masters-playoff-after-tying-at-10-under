Bubba Watson and  Louis Oosthuizen 
entered a sudden-death playoff at the Masters Tournament after
finishing the first major golf championship of the year in a tie
at 10-under par.  There have been 14 playoffs at the Masters, including eight
since the tournament went to a sudden-death format in 1976. The
most recent playoff was in 2009, when Angel Cabrera beat Kenny
Perry and Chad Campbell with a par on the second extra hole.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
