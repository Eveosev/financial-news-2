The Spanish government expects  job
creation  starting from 2013,  ABC  reported, citing unidentified
government officials.  The government is considering measures to reduce spending
in health care and education, including increasing patients’
share of drug bills and reducing the number of tax-funded
medical services, the newspaper reported without saying how it
obtained the information. The government also may raise fees for
university students and increase teachers’ working hours, ABC
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
