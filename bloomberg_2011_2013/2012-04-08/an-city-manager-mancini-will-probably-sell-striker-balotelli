Mario Balotelli  will “probably” be
sold by Manchester City at the end of the season, coach  Roberto
Mancini  said after the striker was red-carded in a 1-0 Premier
League defeat against Arsenal today.  Mancini told reporters after the loss at the Emirates
Stadium, which leaves City eight points behind leader Manchester
United, that he is likely to let Balotelli leave.  “Probably, but I don’t know,” Mancini said at the post-
match press conference. “It depends, because Balotelli is a
fantastic player. Every time, we risk one sent off, like today,
but he can score also in the last minute.”   Balotelli, a 21-year-old Italian in his second season with
the club, was also red-carded in a 1-1 draw at Liverpool in
November and twice in the last campaign. He has scored 17 goals
this season.  “I am finished,” Mancini said. “We have six games and he
will not play in the next six games.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
