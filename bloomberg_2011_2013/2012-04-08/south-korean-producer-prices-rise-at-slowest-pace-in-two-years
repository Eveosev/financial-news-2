South Korean producer inflation rose
at the slowest pace in two years in March on a decline in
agricultural product prices.  Prices (KOPPIYOY)  climbed 2.8 percent from a year earlier, the
smallest gain since March 2010, after a 3.5 percent increase in
February, the Bank of  Korea  said in a statement in  Seoul  today.
They rose 0.6 percent from February.  The Bank of Korea will keep its benchmark rate at 3.25
percent for a 10th straight month on April 13, according to all
of nine economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Consumer prices
rose 2.6 percent in March from a year earlier, the slowest pace
in 20 months, a government report showed on April 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
