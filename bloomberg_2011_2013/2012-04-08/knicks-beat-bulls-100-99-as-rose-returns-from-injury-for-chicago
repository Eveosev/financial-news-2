The  New York Knicks  beat the Chicago
Bulls 100-99 in overtime as  Carmelo Anthony  scored a season-high
43 points and hit the game-winning 3-pointer with 8.2 seconds
left to spoil the return of  Derrick Rose .  The Knicks blew a 21-point first-quarter lead and then
rallied from a 10-point deficit in the last four minutes of
regulation to force overtime against the Bulls, who lead the
 National Basketball Association  with a 43-14 record.  The Knicks improved to 29-27 and maintained their hold on
the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference, one
game ahead of the  Milwaukee  Bucks (28-28). If the standings
remain the same, the Knicks would face the Bulls in the opening
round of the NBA playoffs.  “It was a great atmosphere,” Anthony said in a televised
interview at  New York ’s Madison Square Garden. “We might play
these guys in the playoffs if we keep doing what we’re doing and
get that seed. So this is a big statement game for us and we
willed this win.”  Rose, the NBA’s reigning Most Valuable Player, had 29
points for the Bulls yesterday after missing the previous 12
games with a groin injury.  New York again plays the Bulls, who have already clinched a
playoff berth, tomorrow in Chicago before visiting the Bucks on
April 11. Milwaukee has won two of three games between the teams
this season. The Bucks today host the Oklahoma City Thunder (41-
15), who are second in the Western Conference behind the  San
Antonio Spurs  (40-14). The Thunder won the Northwest Division
title to advance to the postseason, while the Spurs have also
gained a playoff spot.  Spurs’ Win Streak  Oklahoma City beat the  Toronto Raptors  91-75 yesterday,
while San Antonio pushed its winning streak to 11 with a 114-104
victory over Utah.  New York and Milwaukee each have 10 games remaining in the
regular season, which was shortened to 66 games from the usual
82 by a 54-day delay to the start to the campaign as owners and
players negotiated a 10-year labor accord.  The Knicks, playing without Jeremy Lin and Amar’e Stoudemire because of injuries, jumped to a 27-6 lead during the
first quarter yesterday.  Chicago  cut the deficit to 10 points
with less than two minutes remaining in the first half and
trailed 53-45 at halftime.  Chicago outscored New York 30-19 in the third quarter to
take a three-point. Rose had 14 points in the quarter.  The Knicks trailed 91-81 with 3:45 to play and cut the
deficit to three before Anthony hit a 3-pointer to tie the game
with 11 seconds remaining. Anthony then hit the winning shot
from beyond the arc with the Knicks trailing 99-97 in the
closing seconds of overtime.  To contact the reporter on this story:
