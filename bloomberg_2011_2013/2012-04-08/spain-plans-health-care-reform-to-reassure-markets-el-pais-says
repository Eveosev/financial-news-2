 The Spanish government will present
“forceful” measures in coming days to reassure investors after
the nation’s borrowing costs rose,  El Pais  reported, citing
unnamed government officials.  The measures the government is considering include a
“radical change” to the health care system to guarantee its
viability, the newspaper said. A proposal will be ready by the
end of the month and approval is expected by the beginning of
summer, it said.  The government may reduce the services offered by the tax-
funded health care system, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
