The  New York  Mets held on to beat
the Atlanta Braves 7-5 while the Tampa Bay Rays won 3-0 to leave
the Yankees winless through their opening three games of the
Major League Baseball season.  Jonathon Niese took a no-hitter into the seventh inning at
Citi Field in New York in his first start after signing a five-
year contract extension with the Mets. Niese (1-0) gave up four
runs, two earned, on two hits, while walking four and striking
out seven batters in six innings.  The Mets led 7-0 through six innings before giving up five
runs in the seventh and eighth.  New York scored on sacrifice flies by David Wright and
 Jason Bay , while Daniel Murphy, Scott Hairston and Ruben Tejada
contributed run-scoring doubles for the Mets, who improve to 3-0.
Atlantaâ€™s Brian McCann hit the only home run of the game for the
final score, leaving the Braves winless after three games.  At Tropicana Field in  St. Petersburg ,  Florida , the Rays
took the lead in the first inning on a run-scoring triple by
 Matt Joyce . Carlos Pena hit a solo home run to right field in
the third and Jeff Keppinger completed the scoring with another
one-run homer to left field in the sixth.  Phil Hughes took the loss for the Yankees, who also used
three relief pitchers, after surrendering two runs on five hits
in 4 2/3 innings. Jeremy Hellickson got the win after giving up
three hits in 8 2/3 innings for the Rays, who are unbeaten in
three starts this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
