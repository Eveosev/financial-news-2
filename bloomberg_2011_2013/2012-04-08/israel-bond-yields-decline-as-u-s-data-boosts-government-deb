Israel ’s benchmark bonds rose,
sending the yield to the lowest in more than a month, as signs
of weaker U.S. job growth boosted demand for government debt.  The yield on the benchmark Mimshal Shiklit bond due January
2022 fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 4.64
percent at 1:17 p.m. in  Tel Aviv , the lowest since Feb. 28. The
shekel was little changed at 3.7401 a dollar on April 6, having
weakened 0.8 percent this month.  U.S. 10-year yields  dropped the most since October as less-
than-forecast jobs growth renewed speculation the  Federal
Reserve  will need to provide more monetary stimulus to sustain
the economic recovery. Israeli  government bonds  tend to track
debt in the U.S., one of the nation’s biggest trading partners.  “The decline in local long-term government bond yields is
tracking a fall in U.S. 10-year yields on Friday,” said Modi Shafrir, chief economist at Tel Aviv-based I.L.S. Brokers Ltd.  Israel’s benchmark interest rate probably will remain at
its current level of 2.5 percent until the second half of 2013,
and then rise to 2.75 percent by the end of next year, the Bank
of Israel’s research department said in a report April 5. The
nation’s budget deficit will probably widen to 3.4 percent of
economic output in 2012 from 3.3 percent in 2011 as growth
slows, the  International Monetary Fund  said in an April 2
report.  Inflation Expectations  “There are still threats to the local economy, such as the
impact of the global economy, and the Bank of Israel is not
expected to start raising  interest rates  in coming months,”
Shafrir said. “At the same time rising inflation expectations
do not support any further interest rate cuts in coming
months.”  The two-year break-even rate, the yield difference between
the inflation-linked bonds and fixed-rate government bonds of
similar maturity, fell five basis points to 287. That implies an
average annual inflation rate of 2.87 percent over the period,
at the higher end of the 1 percent to 3 percent target range.
Inflation in the next four quarters will reach 2.6 percent,
according to the central bank’s research department.  Two-year interest-rate swaps , an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period, were unchanged at 2.8
percent on April 6. The  Bank of Israel , which reduced its
benchmark rate three times between September and January, will
probably keep borrowing costs at 2.5 percent for a third month
at the rate-setting meeting on April 23, according to 16
economists in a  Bloomberg survey .  The  Tel Aviv Bond 40 Index (TEL-B40)  , which measures inflation-
linked and fixed-rate corporate bonds, increased 0.2 percent to
265.73.  To contact the reporter on this story:
