The U.S. reached the semifinals of
tennis’s Davis Cup for the first time since 2008 after a four-
set win for  John Isner  against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga on the final
day of its matchup against  France .  Isner beat Tsonga 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), 5-7, 6-3 at the Monte
Carlo Country Club today to give the U.S. an unbeatable lead in
the best-of-five contest. The  record 32-time winner  will next
face defending champion Spain, which beat Austria 4-1.  In the other two quarterfinals, the  Czech Republic  beat
Serbia, while Argentina defeated Croatia. The semifinals will be
played Sept. 14-16.  Isner,  ranked No. 11  by the ATP Tour, took a two-set lead
against world No. 6 Tsonga before his opponent rallied to take
the match into a fourth set. The American then broke Tsonga’s
serve early on in the fourth and held on to win.  Both players had won their opening singles matches on April
6, before top-ranked doubles pair Bob and  Mike Bryan  put the
U.S. ahead for a first time yesterday.  France’s Gilles Simon defeated Ryan Harrison 6-2, 6-3 in
the last match.  Spain, without world No. 2 Rafael Nadal who opted not to
compete in the top men’s tennis team competition this year,
progressed against Austria as David Ferrer maintained his
unbeaten record on clay in the Davis Cup.  Ferrer beat Jurgen Melzer 7-5, 6-3, 6-3 to give Spain an
unbeatable lead, with Nicolas Almagro then defeating Alexander
Peya 7-5, 7-5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
