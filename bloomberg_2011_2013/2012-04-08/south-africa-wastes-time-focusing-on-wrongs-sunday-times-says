South Africa “wastes an enormous”
amount of energy blaming people for colonialism, instead of
focusing on creating jobs, the Sunday Times reported, citing
 Randgold Resources Ltd. (RRS)  Chief Executive Officer Mark Bristow.  South Africa is going in the opposite direction of other
African nations that are promoting investment and job creation,
the Johannesburg-based newspaper said, citing Bristow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
