Iran  will start early production
from its Yadavaran oil field in “days,” the Oil Ministry’s
website reported, citing Naji Sadouni, managing director of
Iran’s Petroleum Engineering & Development Co.  The oil field will start with a production of 20,000
barrels of oil a day, Sadouni said, according to  Shana .  Yadavaran’s development plan comes in three phases with an
output of 85,000 oil barrels a day upon completion of the first
phase, and 180,000 and 300,000 in the second and third phases
respectively, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
