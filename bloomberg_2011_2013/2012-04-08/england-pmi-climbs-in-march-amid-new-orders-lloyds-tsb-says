England’s business activity expanded
in March as orders picked up, with output in London climbing to
an eight-month high, according to a survey by Lloyds TSB
Commercial.  An index based on a survey of  purchasing managers  compiled
by Markit for the business-lending unit of  Lloyds Banking Group
Plc (LLOY)  rose to 55.3 from 54.5 in February, Lloyds said in an e-
mailed statement. The reading for the London area climbed to
58.2 from 55, the report said. A 50-point level signals no
change in activity.  “There has been a solid pick up in momentum across the
English regions, and this is yet another sign that a double-dip
recession may well be avoided,” John Maltby, group director at
Lloyds TSB Commercial, said in the statement.  U.K. services growth unexpectedly accelerated in  March (PMITSUK) , a
Markit Economics Ltd. report said April 4. Manufacturing
expanded at the fastest pace in 10 months in March, while
construction growth also accelerated, according to other Markit
surveys last week.  Management in eight of nine English regions reported an
increase in activity, with the northeast area posting a decline,
today’s report said. The monthly poll gathers data, including
sales, employment, inventories and prices, from about 1,200
private manufacturing and services companies across the country.  Seven of the nine regions reported a better performance in
the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
