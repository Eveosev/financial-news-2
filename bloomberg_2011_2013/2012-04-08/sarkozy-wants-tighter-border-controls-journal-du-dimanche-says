President  Nicolas Sarkozy  threatened
to pull out of Europe’s open-border zone and called on China and
Japan to open public markets, the  Journal du Dimanche  reported,
citing an interview.  Greece needs to police its border with Turkey, otherwise
 France  will quit Europe’s Schengen border agreement, the Sunday
newspaper reported. Europe also must demand more trade
reciprocity from other countries or France will award public
contracts only to companies with European production sites,
Sarkozy said in the newspaper.  Sarkozy, who is fighting for re-election in a two-round
vote April 22 and May 6, cited former President Charles de
Gaulle’s “empty chair” boycott in 1965 when France withdrew
its representatives to Europe, provoking institutional
paralysis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
