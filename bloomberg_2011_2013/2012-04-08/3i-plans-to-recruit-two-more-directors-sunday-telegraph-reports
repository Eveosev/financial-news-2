3i Group Plc (III)  will recruit two more
non-executive directors to its board following shareholder
dissent, the Sunday Telegraph reported.  The private equity firm has been seeking to add new
directors for some time, Chairman Adrian Montague said,
according to the newspaper.  Hedge fund Laxey Partners had called for 3i to sell assets
and stop making new investments after Chief Executive Officer
Michael Queen said he will leave the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
