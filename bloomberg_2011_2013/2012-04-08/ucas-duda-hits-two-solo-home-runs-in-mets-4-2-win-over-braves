Lucas Duda  hit two solo home runs to
help the  New York Mets  to a 4-2 victory over the winless  Atlanta
Braves  in a Major League Baseball game.  David Wright started the Mets’ scoring with a home run in
the first inning yesterday at Citi Field in New York. Duda’s
home runs came in the fourth and seventh innings of the Mets’
second straight victory.  “He benefited from late last summer when he was in the
lineup every day and he realized that he belongs here,” said
Mets manager Terry Collins, referring to Duda. “He’s got a
chance to be some kind of power hitter.”  Josh Thole singled to right in the fifth to score  Ike Davis 
for the Mets (2-0).  Martin Prado hit a home run and drove in Michael Bourn in
the fifth inning for the Braves (0-2).  R.A. Dickey (1-0) allowed two runs on five hits, walked
four and struck out three in six innings for the Mets. Jair Jurrjens (0-1) surrendered seven hits, three runs and three
walks while striking out three in 4 1/3 innings for Atlanta.  To contact the reporter on this story:
