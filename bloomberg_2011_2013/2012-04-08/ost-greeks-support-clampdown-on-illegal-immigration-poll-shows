Ahead of May elections, more than
six in 10 Greeks, or 61.7 percent, agree with recent government
moves to clamp down on illegal immigration in the country, a
poll showed.  A survey of 1,610 Greeks over the age of 18 by Kapa
Research SA for  To Vima  newspaper published today found that
83.4 percent of interviewees believe illegal immigration is a
major problem for  Greece  while 48.3 percent said that the main
priority of any immigration policy should be to gradually remove
all immigrants from the country, up from 19.5 percent in a
similar poll in 2009.  Greece’s government plans to create 30 detention centers
on the mainland to house illegal immigrants, who don’t qualify
for asylum, before they are deported, the country’s Citizen
Protection Ministry said March 27.  More than half of those surveyed by Kappa, or 54.7 percent,
said such centers are necessary while 61.7 percent said recent
Greek police actions to carry out widespread identification
checks and arrests of illegal immigrants is a move in the right
direction to control the problem.  Greece will require immigrants to obtain health
certificates before being granted work permits and those with
contagious diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis will be
quarantined in medical facilities, Health Minister Andreas Loverdos said April 1. Nearly 72 percent of those surveyed agree
with the requirement, the poll showed.  The land border between Greece and  Turkey  is the main entry
point for immigrants into the European Union from  Asia ,
according to Frontex, the EU’s Warsaw-based agency for external
border security. In 2011, about 100,000 people were arrested for
crossing Greece’s borders illegally, according to  Greek police 
statistics. Greece is due to hold elections on May 6 or May 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
