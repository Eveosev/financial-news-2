Allot Communications Ltd. (ALLT) , the
Israeli maker of high-speed networking equipment, advanced to
the highest level on record in  Tel Aviv , narrowing the gap with
its U.S.-traded shares.  The  shares  climbed 8.1 percent to 89.78 shekels, or the
equivalent of $24, the highest level since December 2010, when
Bloomberg started tracking the data, at 10:51 a.m. in Tel Aviv.
The stock rose 8 percent to $24.31 in New York on April 5, after
Allot said it won an initial order worth about $4 million to
supply equipment to a Latin American telephone operator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
