The U.S. signed a memorandum of
understanding today with  Afghanistan  to transfer command of
nighttime operations and all other special actions to Afghan
troops.  Afghanistan’s Defense Minister, General Abdul Rahim Wardak
said at a news conference in Kabul that “from today, all the
special operations,” including nighttime raids “have been
Afghanized, and the operations will be conducted,” by Afghan
forces.  President Hamid Karzai has repeatedly called for an end to
U.S. military night raids. Last month, the U.S. agreed to
transfer its main prison in Afghanistan to Karzai’s government
within six months. That step, and the memorandum of
understanding to transfer control of special operations, are
clearing the way toward an agreement in which some U.S. forces
may stay in Afghanistan beyond the planned pullout of
international combat units in 2014.  “Today we are one step closer to the establishment of
U.S.-Afghan strategic partnership,” said U.S. Marine General
John Allen, who signed the agreement with Wardak. Captured
enemies will be tried, “in accordance to rule of law,” of
Afghanistan, Allen said.  The strategic partnership pact will be signed in a NATO
summit in  Chicago  in May, Allen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
