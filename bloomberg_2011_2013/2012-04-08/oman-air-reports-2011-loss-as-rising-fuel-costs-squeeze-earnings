Oman Air , the sultanate’s state-
owned carrier, posted a loss of 110 million rials ($144 million)
last year as fuel-price increases hit earnings, the company said
in an e-mailed statement.  “The results for the year were impacted by 38 percent
increase in the fuel price which alone increased the expenditure
by 37 million rials,” it said today. The loss would have
narrowed in the absence of the “steep increase in fuel price”,
it said.  Additionally, the carrier’s labor costs increased by 8
million rials to 87.3 million rials, after it increased salaries
to meet rising costs of living. The airline, which added two
 Embraer (EMBR3)  E175 regional aircraft to its fleet in the period,
carried 16 percent more passengers, amounting to 3.8 million,
compared to the previous year. Revenue increased 35 percent to
311.3 million rials, it said.  Airline profits will plunge 62 percent in 2012 to $3
billion, equal to a 0.5 percent margin on sales, as oil prices
rise, the  International Air Transport Association  said in March.
Global passenger traffic grew 8.6 percent in February compared
with a year earlier, IATA said April 3, while cautioning that
the outlook remains “fragile” as fuel costs and the economy
crimp earnings.  Omar Air operates a fleet of four Airbus A330-200s, three
A330-300s, 15 Boeing Co. 737s, two E175 and two ATR 42s. It has
six  Boeing Co. (BA)  787 Dreamliners on order for delivery in 2015 and
orders for two E175s with an option for five more.  To contact the reporter on this story:
