Russia’s  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  will have its
biggest annual gain since 2009, adding another 16 percent by the
end of December, according to technical analysis by Auerbach
Grayson & Co.  The nation’s benchmark stock gauge slid 4.5 percent to
1,494.86 in the three day to March 29, trading below its 200-day
moving average of 1,513 for the first time since Jan. 25. This
so-called false breakdown was a sign that the Micex would enter
a rallying phase, according to  Richard Ross , a technical analyst
at Auerbach Grayson in  New York .  “Those false breakdowns can lead to fast moves in the
opposite direction,” Ross said by phone last week. “A false
breakdown, below the 200-day average, is the market’s way of
shaking you out of a big advance, that could be exactly what
we’re setting ourselves up for.”  The 30-stock measure may end the year as high as 1,730,
Ross said. That would represent an advance of 23.4 percent, the
biggest  annual gain  since 2009, when the Micex surged 121
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The measure slid 1.8
percent to 1,497.19 in Moscow on April 6.  The Micex’s 6.3 percent slump in the last two weeks of the
first quarter, its first two-week decline this year, was a
“pullback” in the index that created a “very compelling
buying opportunity,” according to Ross.  “Buyers are still out there looking for opportunities to
get into the Micex, not to get out of the Micex,” he said.  The gauge  trades  for 5.8 times analysts’ earnings estimates
for member companies, the cheapest of 21  emerging markets 
tracked by Bloomberg. That compares with 11 times for  Brazil ’s
 Bovespa Index (IBOV)  and the Shanghai Composite Index’s 9.7 valuation
multiple, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Futures (VEA)  expiring in June on Russia’s dollar-denominated RTS
Index gained 0.5 percent to 156,550 in U.S. trading at the end
of last week. Trading of American depositary receipts and U.S.-
listed stocks in New York was closed for a holiday on April 6,
while Russian markets were open.  To contact the reporter on this story:
