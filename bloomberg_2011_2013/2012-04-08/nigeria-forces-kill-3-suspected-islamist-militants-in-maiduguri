Three suspected Nigerian Islamist
militants belonging to the Boko Haram group were shot dead by
the military in the north-eastern city of Maiduguri, Sagir Musa,
a spokesman for the government’s Joint Task Force said today.  “Three suspected Boko Haram members were today shot dead
while two were arrested when the JTF attacked one of the
hideouts belonging to the group,” Musa said by phone from
Maiduguri. “They opened fire at the JTF as we approached the
area,” Musa said. There were no military casualties, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
