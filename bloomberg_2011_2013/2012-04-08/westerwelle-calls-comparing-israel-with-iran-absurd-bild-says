German Foreign Minister  Guido Westerwelle  said that putting Israel and Iran on the same moral
level is “absurd,” according to a commentary the he wrote in
Bild am Sonntag.  Germany  has “historic responsibility” for Israel and the
two countries share a partnership of values with belief in
democracy, rights for individuals, freedom, responsibility and
the rule of law, Westerwelle said. In contrast, Iran has
violated international law, avoiding for years full cooperation
to control its nuclear program, the foreign minister said.  Westerwelle’s comments come in reaction to a poem published
by  Nobel Prize  winning author Guenter Grass April 4. In the poem
“ What Has to Be Said ,” Grass says that Israel as a nuclear
power “is endangering already-fragile world peace” and
describes its nuclear potential as “out of control, because no
one can examine it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
