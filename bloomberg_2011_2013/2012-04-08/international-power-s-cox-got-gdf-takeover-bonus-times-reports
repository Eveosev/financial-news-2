International Power (IPR)  Plc’s Chief
Executive Officer Philip Cox received a 3.2-million pound ($5.1
million) “change of control” bonus after agreeing to cede a
majority stake in the utility to  GDF Suez SA (GSZ)  last year, the
Sunday Times reported.  The payment stemmed from stock options in International
Power held by Cox that were converted into cash, the paper said,
citing the company’s annual financial report last week.
International Power completed a merger of assets with Paris-
based GDF last year, with Cox keeping its job.  To contact the reporter on this story:
