U.S. stocks fell, dragging the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lower following its worst week of
2012, after employers added fewer jobs than forecast in March.  Financial shares declined 1.9 percent for the biggest drop
out of 10 groups in the S&P 500.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and
JPMorgan Chase & Co. erased at least 2.1 percent.  Caterpillar
Inc. (CAT)  and  General Electric Co. (GE)  sank more than 1.8 percent, pacing
losses among industrial companies.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , scheduled to
report earnings tomorrow, advanced 0.4 percent.  The S&P 500 slumped 1.2 percent to 1,381.79 at 10:24 a.m.
New York time, following the benchmark index’s 0.7 percent
weekly loss. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  dropped 132.03
points, or 1 percent, to 12,928.11. U.S. exchanges were shut for
Good Friday on April 6, when the employment report was released.  “At the moment, the one big news story that people have to
focus on is the jobs number so there’s a focus on the
disappointment there,”  John Carey , who helps oversee about $220
billion at Pioneer Investments in  Boston , said in a telephone
interview. “The economy does continue to grow, but slowly, and
I think that’s been the source of frustration for a lot of
investors, that we haven’t had the big forward movement in the
economy like we have in the past.”  Equities slumped last week after the  Federal Reserve 
signaled it will refrain from further monetary stimulus and
concern about  Europe  intensified. The U.S. Labor Department said
April 6 that employers added 120,000 jobs, the fewest in five
months and less than the median economist forecast of 205,000 in
a Bloomberg survey. The amount had exceeded 200,000 for three
straight months.  ‘Real Shock’  “This is a real shock,”  Donald Selkin , the New York-based
chief market strategist at National Securities Corp., which
manages about $3 billion, said last week after the jobs report.
“Everybody is so hung up on the 200,000 increase.”  The U.S. jobs report presents a challenge that stocks have
overcome nine times during the  bull market  that’s driven the  S&P
500 (SPX)  up 107 percent in three years. The government’s monthly
tally of U.S. hiring missed the median projection by 85,000,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While the S&P 500
averaged losses of 0.8 percent in the day after shortfalls of
this magnitude since March 2009, the benchmark gauge cut its
decline in half a week later and was up 0.9 percent after two
weeks, the data show.  Fewer Hours  Equities are failing to build on the S&P 500’s best first-
quarter  rally  since 1998. The U.S.  jobless rate  fell to 8.2
percent, the lowest since January 2009, from 8.3 percent, the
Labor Department said. Faster employment growth that leads to
bigger wage gains is needed to propel  consumer spending  that
accounts for about 70 percent of the economy. Americans worked
fewer hours and earned less on average, helping explain why the
Fed says  interest rates  may need to stay low at least through
late 2014.  “What it calls into question and what the debate will be
about is, once again, what is the pace of the recovery?”  Mark Freeman , who oversees about $13 billion as chief investment
officer at Westwood Holdings Group Inc. in Dallas, said last
week.  Fed Minutes  Minutes from the March 13 meeting of the  Federal Open
Market Committee  showed that the central bank will refrain from
increasing monetary accommodation unless economic expansion
falters or prices rise at a rate slower than its 2 percent
target. Concern about Europe’s debt crisis intensified as  Spain 
sold 2.59 billion euros ($3.4 billion) of bonds at an auction,
less than the maximum target of 3.5 billion euros.  Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke has kept rates near zero since
2008 and expanded the central bank’s balance sheet with two
rounds of asset purchases totaling $2.3 trillion.  S&P 500 
rallies during the first quarter of 2010 and 2011 stalled in
April both years, with the index sinking as much as 16 percent
and 19 percent, respectively, amid concern the Fed would stop
stimulating the economy.  The S&P 500 surged 12 percent from January through March of
this year as data on manufacturing, real estate and the labor
market boosted optimism about the world’s largest economy.
Reports last week showed manufacturing in the U.S. expanded at a
faster pace than forecast while jobless claims dropped to the
lowest level in four years.  Banks Tumble  Investors sold shares of companies most tied to economic
growth. Financial stocks dropped 1.9 percent, the largest
decline in the S&P 500. Bank of America lost 2.9 percent to
$8.97, the biggest retreat in the Dow. JPMorgan erased 2.1
percent to $43.40. The KBW Bank Index dropped 2.2 percent, with
all 24 of its components falling.  Caterpillar retreated 2.3 percent to $103.40 and General
Electric fell 1.8 percent to $19.14, as industrial stocks fell
1.6 percent, the second-biggest decline as a group in the S&P
500.  Alcoa rose 0.4 percent to $9.67. The largest U.S. aluminum
producer will report first-quarter earnings after the close of
trading tomorrow. The average estimate of 19 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey is for an adjusted loss of 4 cents a share.  To contact the reporters on this story:
