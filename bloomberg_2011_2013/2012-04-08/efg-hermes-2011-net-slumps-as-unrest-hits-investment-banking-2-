EFG-Hermes Holding SAE (HRHO)  posted an 81
percent plunge in 2011 profit as the biggest publicly traded
Arab investment bank was hurt by political unrest in  Egypt .  Net income after minority interest fell to 133 million
Egyptian pounds ($22 million) from 708 million pounds a year
earlier, the Cairo-based company said in a filing to the
Egyptian bourse today. Investment banking income dropped 44
percent to 668 million pounds after the company reported a one-
time gain in 2010 from the sale of its stake in Lebanon’s Bank
Audi SAL-Audi Saradar Group.  Egypt’s benchmark stock index plunged 49 percent last year,
making it the world’s third-worst performing equity index
tracked by Bloomberg. The Arab nation’s economy slowed in the
aftermath of the popular uprising that overthrew former
President  Hosni Mubarak .  Shares of EFG-Hermes  declined 1.7 percent to 12.63 pounds
at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo, trimming the stock’s gain this
year to 26 percent. The company has a market value of 6.04
billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
