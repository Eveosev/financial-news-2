U.S. corn stockpiles are poised to
be the smallest in 16 years by August and soybean reserves will
be lower than the government expected, potentially accelerating
food-price inflation in an election year.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  may say tomorrow that
corn inventories on Aug. 31 will be 37 percent lower than a year
earlier at 715 million bushels (18.2 million metric tons), the
average of 32 analyst forecasts compiled by Bloomberg show. That
compares with a projection of 801 million bushels last month.
Soybean stockpiles will be 242 million bushels, down from a
March prediction of 275 million, the survey showed.  The government is already predicting food inflation of 2.5
percent to 3.5 percent in 2012. While that’s down from 3.7
percent in 2011, it would be higher than gains in as many as
five of the past eight years. Drivers are contending with
 gasoline  prices that have jumped 20 percent this year, American
Automobile Association data show. Global food costs rose for the
third straight month in March, the  United Nations  said April 5.  “Consumers will see additional price gains this year,”
said  Corinne Alexander , an agricultural economist at  Purdue
University  in Lafayette,  Indiana . “There will be no relief for
consumers until later this year if high prices lead to large
world crops.”  Half Century  Corn prices averaged $6.405 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board
of Trade in the first quarter, 2.8 percent more than in the
previous three months and the fifth-highest in data going back
more than a half century. Soybeans averaged $12.752 a bushel,
8.1 percent more than in the fourth quarter. The Standard &
Poor’s GSCI Agriculture Index of eight  commodities  has climbed
1.2 percent this year.  U.S. corn  reserves  relative to usage may fall to the lowest
ever this year, Morgan Stanley and Jefferies Bache LLC forecast.
The grain, used mostly in livestock feed and to make ethanol, is
the biggest U.S. crop by value, followed by soybeans, hay and
wheat. The USDA report is set for 8:30 a.m. in  Washington .  Cattle futures in Chicago reached a record $1.315 a pound
on Feb. 22, partly because high corn-feed costs prompted farmers
to shrink herds. Retail prices of pork chops and beef were close
to all-time highs in February, government data show.  Cost of Living  The cost of living in the U.S. rose in February by the most
in 10 months as gasoline costs jumped. The consumer-price index
climbed 0.4 percent, after increasing 0.2 percent the prior
months, the Labor Department said on March 16. The so-called
core measure, which excludes more volatile food and energy
costs, increased 0.1 percent.  Food inflation of 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent would still be
better than in some of the past several years. Prices advanced 4
percent in 2007 and 5.5 percent in 2008, before moderating to
gains of 1.8 percent in 2009 and 0.8 percent in 2010, according
to the USDA. The UN’s global food index is still about 9 percent
below the record reached in February 2011.  Higher food prices have yet to damp  consumer confidence ,
with the Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index rising to minus 31.4
in the week ended April 1, the best reading since March 2008.
Unemployment has dropped to 8.2 percent from as much as 10
percent in 2009, Bureau of Labor Statistics data show. The
presidential election is Nov. 6.  Corn surged the most in 21 months on March 30 after
inventories as of March 1 fell more than analysts forecast to
the lowest for that date since 2004. Futures for May delivery
declined 1.4 percent today to settle at $6.49 in Chicago. Global
stockpiles may fall 5.4 percent to 122.04 million tons by Sept.
30, the lowest since 2007, the Bloomberg survey of analysts
showed.  ‘Tight’ Supplies  “U.S. supplies are going to be tight and that means we
need good weather this year to improve inventories,” said  Shawn McCambridge , the senior grain analyst for Jefferies Bache in
Chicago. He said reserves before the harvest will fall to 626
million bushels, or equal to 4.9 percent of consumption, below
the record low of 5 percent in 1974.  The U.S. was the world’s biggest shipper of corn, soybeans
and wheat last year, USDA data show.  The country’s wheat surplus on May 31 may fall to 794
million bushels, compared with 825 million estimated by the USDA
in March and 862 million a year earlier, according to the
analysts surveyed. Futures in Chicago rose 0.7 percent today to
$6.43 a bushel.  Global Reserves  Soybean futures have jumped 18 percent to $14.31 this year
after adverse weather cut output in  South America . Global
 reserves  as of Sept. 30 may tumble 20 percent to 55.34 million
tons, analysts said in the Bloomberg survey.  Drought reduced production in  Brazil , the second-biggest
exporter last year, and  Argentina , the third-largest. Combined
production may fall 10 percent to 111.9 million tons from a
record 124.5 million last year, the analyst survey showed.  “Supplies are tight,” said Alan Brugler, the president of
Brugler Marketing & Management Inc. in Omaha,  Nebraska . “The
market will rally to encourage farmers to plant more soybeans
and other oilseeds to make up for the lost production.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
