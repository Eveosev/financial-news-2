Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. (TAQA)  agreed
to acquire a 50 percent stake in a 1,000-megawatt independent
power project in Iraq’s Kurdish region.  Mass Global Investments Co. is a partner of the government-
run utility, known as Taqa, in the project, according to a
statement on the Abu Dhabi bourse’s website. The 750-megawatt
gas-fired plant near Sulaymaniyah has been operating since 2009
and an additional 250 megawatts is under construction, the
company said.  Taqa owns stakes in businesses that generate power or
produce oil and natural gas in the  Middle East , North America,
the North Sea and India. Last year, it started two new power
plants in the United Arab Emirates, where it is based, and
bought a stake in  WesternZagros Resources Ltd. (WZR) , a Canadian
company with operations in the Kurdistan region of Iraq.  The shares gained as much as 2.3 percent, or 3 fils, to
1.34 dirhams, a level the stock hasn’t reached since March 14,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Taqa added 2 fils, or
1.5 percent, to 1.33 dirhams at 10:24 a.m. in Abu Dhabi.  The company also completed the disposal of its entire
holding in  Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) , representing a 415 million-dirham
($113 million) gain, according to a separate statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
