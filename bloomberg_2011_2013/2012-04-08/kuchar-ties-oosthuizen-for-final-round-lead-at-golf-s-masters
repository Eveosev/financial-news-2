Louis Oosthuizen  and  Matt Kuchar  are
tied for the lead at 9-under par with four holes remaining in
the final round of golf’s  Masters Tournament .  Oosthuizen, who moved into the lead with the fourth double-
eagle in the event’s 76-year history, was tied when Kuchar made
an eagle at the par-5 15th hole at Augusta National Golf Club in
Augusta, Georgia.  Bubba Watson is 8-under par, one shot better than Lee Westwood and three-time champion  Phil Mickelson , who has five
holes remaining. Mickelson has made two birdies since a triple-
bogey on the par-3 sixth hole.  Oosthuizen, the 2010 British Open champion, took the lead
two holes into the final round when his second shot on the par-5
hole landed on the green and rolled into the cup. It was the
first double-eagle on the second hole in Masters history and
took Oosthuizen to 10-under par for the tournament.  Jeff Maggert had the last Masters double-eagle, in 1994 on
the 13th hole. Bruce Devlin had one on the eighth hole in 1967
and Gene Sarazen was the first to do it, making a two on the
par-5 15th hole in winning the 1935 Masters.  Peter Hanson , the 54-hole leader, is 6-under par, tied with
 Padraig Harrington .  Four-time Masters champion Tiger Woods finished at 5-over
par for the tournament after a 2-over 74 today.  Bo Van Pelt shot a tournament-best 8-under-par 64 today,
matching the Masters record for the lowest final-round score.
Van Pelt had two eagles over the final nine holes, including a
hole-in-one on the par-3 16th hole. He finished the tournament
at 1-under par.  To contact the reporter on this story:
