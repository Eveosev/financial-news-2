Ulster beat Munster 22-16 today to
reach the Heineken Cup rugby semifinals, while Clermont Auvergne
also secured a spot in the last four.  Craig Gilroy got the only try at Thomond Park in Limerick
for Ulster, the 1999 champion, while Ruan Pienaar kicked 14
points and Ian Humphreys scored a drop-goal.  Munster, a two-time winner which was aiming for a record
10th semifinal appearance, had rallied from 19-0 down to trail
by nine points at halftime but was unable to complete a
turnaround. Simon Zebo touched down, with  Ronan O’Gara  kicking
the rest of the team’s points.  Lee Byrne got Clermont’s try as the French club won 22-3 at
Saracens. Brock James scored his team’s other points, with an
Owen Farrell penalty the only score for the English hosts.  Ulster will next play Edinburgh, which yesterday upset
record four-time champion Toulouse 19-14. Defending champion
Leinster completes the semifinal lineup following a 34-3 victory
over  Cardiff Blues .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
