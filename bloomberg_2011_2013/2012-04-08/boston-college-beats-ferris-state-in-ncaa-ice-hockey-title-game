Junior Steven Whitney scored two
goals to lead top-seeded  Boston College  to a 4-1 victory over No.
14 seed Ferris State University in college ice hockey’s national
men’s championship game.  Boston College (33-10-1) earned its fifth National
Collegiate Athletic Association title and its 19th consecutive
victory.  “It’s incredible,” Boston College goalie Parker Milner
told reporters. “It’s everything you dream about.”  Milner had 27 saves for the Eagles at  Tampa Bay  Times Forum
in Tampa Bay,  Florida . Taylor Nelson stopped 33 shots for the
Bulldogs (26-12-5).  Whitney scored three minutes into the first period last
night at Tampa Bay Times Forum in Tampa Bay, Florida. Garrett
Thompson tied the game at 1-1 two minutes later before Paul
Carey gave the Eagles a 2-1 advantage midway through the first
period.  Johnny Gaudreau and Whitney each scored a goal in the final
three minutes of the third period to seal the victory.  “What a terrific team Boston College is obviously -- very
deserving of the championship,” Ferris State coach  Bob Daniels 
told reporters. “The goal by Gaudreau was a great individual
effort and a wonderful play on his part, a big-time goal by a
big-time player.”  Ice hockey is the only Ferris State team that competes in
Division I. The Bulldogs, making their first trip to the
championship game, were trying to win the school’s first ever
Division I title.  “I don’t want to shortchange our kids,” Daniels said. “I
have zero regrets about how we performed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
