The South Korean defense ministry
isnâ€™t aware that  North Korea  is planning a nuclear test, a
ministry spokesman said in Seoul early today after the Yonhap
news service reported the north is readying for one.  The defense ministry spokesman spoke on condition of
anonymity, in accord with ministry policy.  Yonhaps reported yesterday that satellite images show the
digging of new tunnels at a site where North Korea conducted
nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
