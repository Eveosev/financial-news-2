(Corrects timing of previous poll in third paragraph.)  The U.K. opposition  Labour Party  has
a 5 percentage-point lead over Prime Minister David Cameron’s
Conservatives as Britons said the government is remote and
elitist, a poll by Survation showed.  Thirty-five percent of voters said they would back Labour
in a general election, with 30 percent supporting the
Conservatives, according to the poll commissioned by the Mail on
Sunday newspaper.  Support for the Conservatives slipped by 1 percentage point
from two weeks earlier. The party’s co-treasurer quit March 25
over allegations of selling access to the prime minister.  Survation interviewed 1,039 people online between April 5
and April 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
