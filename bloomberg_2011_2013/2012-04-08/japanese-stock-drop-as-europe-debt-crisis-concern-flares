Japanese  stock   futures  dropped as
U.S. employers added fewer jobs than forecast, damping the
outlook for a recovery in the world’s biggest economy and
denting the earnings prospects for Asian exporters.  American depositary receipts of  Kyocera Corp. (6971) , an
electronics maker that gets more than half of its sales overseas,
lost 1.5 percent from the closing share price in  Tokyo  as the
yen strengthening against the dollar. Those of Mitsubishi Corp.,
Japan’s largest commodities trader by market value, slid 1.3
percent after oil prices slid. Shares of Nachi-Fujikoshi Corp.
may be active after the bearing maker posted lower profit.  “The results of the employment data may be a
disappointment to investors,” said  Hideyuki Ishiguro , assistant
manager of investment strategy at Okasan Securities Co. in Tokyo.
“People in the markets expected U.S. jobs would improve.”  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  were bid in the
pre-market at 9,540 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. compared with 9,680 at
the close on April 6. Markets in Australia,  New Zealand  and  Hong
Kong  are closed today for a holiday.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  sank 1.2 percent
today after the Labor Department said on April 6 that U.S.
employers added 120,000 jobs in March, the lowest number in five
months. The data also showed the  unemployment rate  fell to 8.2
percent as people left the labor force, while workers put in
fewer hours. Markets in the U.S. were closed April 6 for a
national holiday.  Yen Strength  The yen appreciated to as high as 81.24 against the dollar
today in Tokyo, compared with 82.27 at the close of stock
trading on April 6. Against the euro, Japan’s currency
strengthened to 106.30 from 107.55. A stronger yen cuts the
value of some overseas income for Japanese companies.  Crude oil for May delivery dropped as much as 1.2 percent
to $102.03 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange today.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 9.7 percent this year
through April 6, compared with an 11.2 percent advance by the
S&P 500 and a 5.9 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 1.4 times book value,
compared with 2.3 times for the S&P 500 and 1.4 times for the
Stoxx 600, according to Bloomberg data. A number below 1 means
companies can be bought for less than value of their assets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
