quarter revenue forecast and said it will be in default of a
financial covenant.  The  shares  dropped 16 percent to 2.40 shekels at 10:09 a.m.

since Alvarion on April 5 cut its first-quarter revenue forecast
and said it will be in default on a financial covenant, giving
the Tel Aviv based company a market value of 139 million shekels
($37 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
