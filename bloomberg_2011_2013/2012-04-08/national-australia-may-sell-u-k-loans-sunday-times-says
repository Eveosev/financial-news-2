National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  may
sell property loans from its Clydesdale and Yorkshire lenders as
a first step before a full disposal of the two British
subsidiaries, the Sunday Times said, without saying how it got
the information.  The economic slowdown at home and the European debt crisis
have hurt their residential mortgage and commercial loan books,
the London-based paper said. Clydesdale and Yorkshire may become
attractive to potential buyers if offered without the loans, the
Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
