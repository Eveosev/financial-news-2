Aberdeen Asset Management Plc (ADN)  has
held talks with investors of  Alliance Trust Plc (ATST)  regarding taking
over the management of the fund, the Sunday Telegraph reported.  Alliance investors initiated the discussions as the share
price declined below the value of assets, an unidentified
spokesman for Aberdeen said, according to the newspaper.
Alliance Chairman Karin Forseke said the board had not been
approached by Aberdeen Chief Executive Officer Martin Gilbert,
the newspaper reported.  James Thorneley, a spokesman for Aberdeen Asset Management,
