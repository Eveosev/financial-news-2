South Africa’s plans to increase
taxes on mining companies will “undermine” job creation,
Business Report reported, citing  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)  Chief
Executive Officer Nick Holland.  Gold Fields opposes the government’s plan to implement a
carbon tax starting in April 2013 because it’s unlikely to
generate the promised environmental benefits, the newspaper
said, citing Holland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
