Egypt  agreed to export 369 metric
tons of cotton in the week ending April 5, the Alexandria Cotton
Exporters Association said today in its weekly bulletin.  The country has shipped 66,989 metric tons of cotton valued
at $210.7 million since the marketing year began on Sept 1. Of
last week’s sales, Egypt will ship 47 tons of the Giza 88 cotton
variety, and 322 tons of Giza 86, the association said.  Egypt produces the world’s finest extra-long staple cotton,
which is stronger and softer than shorter staple cotton, and is
used in high-end clothing. Switzerland, Bangladesh and  India  are
the largest importers of Egyptian cotton.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story: Abdel Latif Wahba in
