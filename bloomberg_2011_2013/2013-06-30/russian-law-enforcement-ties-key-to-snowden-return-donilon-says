The U.S. is using law enforcement
connections forged through the investigation of the bombing at
the Boston Marathon to seek the return of Edward Snowden, White
House national security adviser Tom Donilon said.  “We have had a history of law enforcement issues being
resolved effectively, including cooperation on the Boston
Marathon bombing with the Russians,” Donilon said in an
interview on CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS” that aired today.
“These discussions are taking place through law enforcement
channels, which I think is the place for them to take place.”  Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor, is
wanted by the U.S. for disclosing classified programs to collect
the phone records of Americans and monitor Internet
communications of suspected foreign terrorists. He is believed
to be in the transit lounge of a Moscow airport while seeking
asylum in Ecuador.  “He’s not traveling on valid papers and he should be
returned to the  United States  because he’s wanted here for a
crime,” Donilon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
