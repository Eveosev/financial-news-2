Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher  Josh Beckett  will undergo season-ending surgery to relieve pressure
on a nerve in his neck, the Major League Baseball team said.  Beckett, 33, was diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome
after complaining of numbness and tingling in his right pitching
hand since spring training, the Dodgers said. He will have
surgery the week of July 8 in  Dallas .  Recovery from the procedure, which involves removing an
upper rib that compresses nerve tissue near the neck and
shoulder, may take three to five months, the Dodgers said.  Beckett tried throwing two days ago for the first time in a
month.  “Josh kind of went backwards a little bit,” Dodgers
manager  Don Mattingly  told reporters. “I know he had some
tingling again yesterday after throwing. He didn’t throw very
long. I know there was a little bit of a setback there.”  Beckett was 0-5 with a 5.19 earned run average in eight
starts this year before he was put on the disabled list May 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
