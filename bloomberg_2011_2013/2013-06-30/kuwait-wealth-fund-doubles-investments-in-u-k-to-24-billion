Kuwait Investment Authority , the
country’s sovereign wealth fund, doubled investments in the U.K.
over the last 10 years to more than $24 billion.  Investment in Britain was “across all asset classes,
sectors and industries,” Managing Director Bader Al-Saad said
in a speech in  London  on June 28. Kuwait Investment Office, the
KIA’s London-based investment arm, now manages more than $120
billion globally compared with $27 billion 10 years ago.  “Alongside the real estate subsidiary, which manages our
real estate assets, we have set up an infrastructure fund which
we are operating from London,” Al-Saad said. The investment
office “will be looking to manage more funds, in more asset
classes, and in more regions of the world in the near future,”
he said.  The KIA, which has about $342 billion of assets according
to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute in  California , holds
stakes in Daimler AG and  BP Plc. (BP/)  The fund manages Kuwait’s
General Reserve Fund and Future Generations Fund, and invests in
local, Arab and international markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
