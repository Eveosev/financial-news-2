U.K. banks’ share of global industry
profit fell by half to 5 percent since 2007 as Chinese lenders
gained during the financial crisis, according to research by The
Banker magazine.  Chinese banks saw their share of pretax profit soar to 29
percent in 2012 from 4 percent in 2007, according to the study
of 1,000 lenders published today.  U.K. bank earnings slumped in the period as companies
including  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  were bailed out by
taxpayers and compelled to write down the value of loans, cut
jobs and sell assets. Britain’s four largest lenders will have
eliminated about 189,000 jobs by the end of this year from their
peak staffing levels, bringing employment to a nine-year low,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “While U.K. banks as a whole have suffered tremendously in
terms of their share of global banking profits, the performance
of individual U.K. banks is extremely varied,” said Brian Caplen, editor of London-based The Banker, which is owned by the
Financial Times. “Some are making huge profits, while others
make huge losses.”  RBS posted a full-year pretax loss of 5.17 billion pounds
($7.9 billion) for 2012, while  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) ,
Britain’s biggest mortgage lender, recorded a 570 million-pound
pretax loss. Barclays Plc’s pretax profit was 246 million pounds
for the year and  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ’s $20.6 billion.  -- Editors: Jon Menon, Steve Bailey  To contact the reporter on this story:
