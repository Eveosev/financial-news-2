A sightseeing helicopter carrying
four passengers made an emergency landing in  New York ’s  Hudson
River  near 79th Street around noon today, the U.S.  Federal
Aviation Administration  said.  All on board the Bell 206 were rescued and are uninjured,
according to local authorities, FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen
said in an e-mailed statement. The helicopter, registered to  New
York Helicopter Charter Inc ., was lifted onto a tugboat with a
crane and moved to the Wall Street Heliport, she said.  The New York Fire Department said it received a call at
around 11:58 a.m. about the incident, and that the  helicopter 
had dropped from an unknown height after experiencing engine
trouble. Good Samaritans from a nearby boat and a jet ski helped
the passengers to safety, FDNY firefighter and spokesman Daniel
Glover said by telephone.  The passengers, a family of four, were taken to St. Luke’s-Roosevelt Hospital Center as a precaution, while the pilot
refused further medical attention, Glover said. Their names
weren’t released.  “The pilot made a precautionary, emergency landing,” said
New York Helicopter Charter owner Mike Roth in phone interview.
“Everybody is fine and everybody has gone home.”  The helicopter-tour operator offers sightseeing flights
beginning at $139 for a 15-minute “Liberty Tour,” according to
its website.  Both the FAA and the  National Transportation Safety Board 
are investigating the incident, Bergen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
