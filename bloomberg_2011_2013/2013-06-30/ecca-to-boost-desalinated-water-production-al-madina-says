Saudi Arabia ’s  Saline Water
Conversion Corp.  plans to increase production of drinking water
in the Islamic holy city of Mecca by 29 percent to a record
670,000 cubic meters a day,  al-Madina  reported, citing
Abdulrahman Al-Ibrahim, the company’s governor.  The state-run company said earlier this month that the city
of  Jeddah , the kingdom’s second-biggest city, is being supplied
with 1.2 million cubic meters a day of desalinated water.  Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest producer of desalinated
water, is building additional plants to meet growing domestic
demand. National Water Co. completed 840 million riyals ($224
million) of waterworks around Mecca on June 17 to accommodate
more pilgrims seeking to visit the city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
