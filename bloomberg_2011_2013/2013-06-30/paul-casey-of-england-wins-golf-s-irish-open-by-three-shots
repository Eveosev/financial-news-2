England’s  Paul Casey  scored a final-round 67, 5-under par, to win golf’s Irish Open by three shots
after coming back from a four-shot deficit on the final day.  Casey wrapped up his first win in two years with an eagle
at the final hole, ending on 14-under.  Robert Rock  of England
and Joost Luiten of the Netherlands were joint second at
Maynooth.  Ireland’s major winners Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell,
Darren Clarke and Padraig Harrington missed the halfway cut.  Casey, 35, picked up a check for 333,330 euros ($435,000)
for his 12th win on the European Tour.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
