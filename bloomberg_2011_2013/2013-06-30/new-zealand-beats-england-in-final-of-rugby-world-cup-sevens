Tim Mikkelson scored two of  New
Zealand ’s five tries as the Kiwis beat England 33-0 in the final
of the Rugby World Cup Sevens in Moscow.  There were also tries for Tomasi Cama, Waisake Naholo and
Gillies Kaka as New Zealand followed up its quarterfinal and
semifinal wins over defending champion Wales and Fiji,
respectively.  It was the last global championship before the sport makes
its Olympic Games debut in  Rio de Janeiro  in 2016. The
International Rugby Board said June 12 that the next edition
will take place in five years’ time in order for the tournament
to be integrated into the Olympic cycle.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
