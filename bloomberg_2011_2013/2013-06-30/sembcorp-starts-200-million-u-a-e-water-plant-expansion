Sembcorp Industries Ltd. (SCI)  today
started the $200 million expansion of a water-desalination plant
in the United Arab Emirates that it operates together with the
government-owned utilities of  Abu Dhabi .  The expansion of the Fujairah 1 Independent Water and Power
Plant will add 30 million imperial gallons per day of
desalination capacity at the facility by the first half of 2015,
the Singapore-based company said in a statement.  Emirates SembCorp Water & Power Co., as the venture is
known, currently has 100 MIGD of desalination and 893 megawatts
of power-generation capacity, according to its  website .  Abu
Dhabi National Energy Co. (TAQA) , known as Taqa, and Abu Dhabi Water
and Electricity Authority own 60 percent of the venture.
Sembcorp holds the rest.  Middle Eastern oil producers are expanding power and
desalination capacity to meet the demand of growing populations.
Abu Dhabi, the largest emirate in and capital of the U.A.E., is
financing power and water expansions to serve smaller sheikhdoms
such as Fujairah.  Acciona SA (ANA)  of Spain said in January it won the contract for
the expansion work from the Fujairah 1 venture.  To contact the reporter on this story:
