U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry 
wound up three days of shuttling between Israeli and Palestinian
leaders today saying more talks were needed to end a three-year
impasse in peace efforts.  “We have had very positive discussions, very important
discussions, for the last few days,” Kerry told reporters after
meeting with Palestinian President  Mahmoud Abbas  in Ramallah.
“We agreed we have made real progress, but we have a few things
we need to work on.”  The top U.S. diplomat went back and forth between Amman,
Jerusalem and Ramallah, meeting three times each with Abbas and
Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu .  Talks stalled over continued Israeli settlement
construction. The Palestinians have refused to resume
negotiations unless construction in areas they claim for a
future state halts. Israel says there should be no conditions
for renewing talks toward an accord.  To contact the reporter on this story:
