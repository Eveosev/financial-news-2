Gold prices advanced the most in nine
weeks as demand for coins, bars and jewelry rebounded following
the record quarterly plunge. Platinum posted the biggest gain in
a year.  In the second quarter, spot gold tumbled 23 percent, the
most since at least 1920 after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said that the U.S. central bank may scale back debt
purchase this this year. The premium for the metal in  China  rose
to $36 an ounce, the highest since April, according to Tim Gardiner, a managing director at TD Securities Inc. in  New York .  “Physical demand in  Asia  continues to be strong,” Carlos Perez-Santalla, a New York-based broker at Marex North America
LLC, said in a telephone interview. “The focus on the Fed
stimulus and when the tapering may begin has begun to wane.”  Gold futures for August delivery rose 2.6 percent to settle
at $1,255.70 at 1:46 p.m. on the Comex in New York, the biggest
gain for a most-active contract since April 25. On June 28, the
price touched $1,179.40 on June 28, the lowest since Aug. 2,
2010.  Futures have slumped 25 percent this year, wiping out $59.5
billion from the value of  exchange-traded products  backed by the
metal, as some investors lost faith in gold as a store of value.  Production Cost  The price may climb because reducing the stimulus might
take longer than some analyst expect, and the price approached
the cost of output, according to Macquarie Group Ltd.  Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s biggest gold producer, said
on June 28 that it may take a writedown of as much as $5.5
billion on its Pascua-Lama project in the Andes after prices
tumbled.  Futures more than doubled from the end of 2008 to a record
$1,923.70 in September 2011 as the U.S. central bank led nations
in cutting  interest rates  and buying debt. Bernanke said June 19
that the Fed may reduce its $85 billion of monthly purchases
this year and end the program in 2014.  Silver futures for September delivery rose 0.6 percent to
$19.578 an ounce on the Comex. On June 28, the price touched
$18.17, the lowest since August 2010. This year, the metal has
tumbled 35 percent, the most among 24  raw materials  in the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery jumped 3.2 percent to $1,382.50 an ounce, the
most since June 29, 2012. Last month, the metal dropped 8.3
percent, the fifth straight decline and the longest slump since
October 2001.  Palladium futures for September delivery surged 3.9 percent
to $686.70 an ounce, the biggest gain since May 28.  To contact the reporters on this story:
