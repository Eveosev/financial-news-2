South Korea ’s Inbee Park expanded
her lead to four strokes going into today’s final round of the
U.S. Women’s Open.  Park, 24, birdied the 18th hole to card a 1-under 71
yesterday for a 10-under 206 after 54 holes at Sebonack Golf
Club in Southampton,  New York . She was the only player to break
par among the 68 golfers who made the cut for the final two
rounds.  Park is seeking her third consecutive win in women’s major
tournaments this season.  “The wind was a bit stronger, so the conditions were
tough,” Park told reporters. “The pin positions were tough, a
lot of long irons hitting into the greens. It was just a very
tough day, but I think I battled it really good out there. I had
my tough times in the middle but ended up finishing very good,
so I’m happy with that.”  I.K. Kim, who shot a 1-over 73 yesterday, is in second
place four strokes back followed by Jodi Ewart Shadoff, who had
a 2-over 74 to finish third at 3-under 213.  To contact the reporter on this story:
