Hedge funds  cut wagers on a gold
rally to a five-year low as a record quarterly drop drove prices
below $1,200 an ounce for the first time since 2010 and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. forecast more declines.  Money managers reduced their net-long  position  by 20
percent to 31,197 futures and options by June 25, U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission data show. That’s the lowest since
June 2007. Holdings of short contracts climbed 5 percent to
77,027, the second-highest on record. Net-bullish  wagers  across
18 commodities tumbled 9 percent, the most in 12 weeks.  Gold’s 27 percent slump to the end of June, the worst
first-half performance since 1981, erased  $60.4 billion  from the
value of assets in exchange-traded products as investors cut
holdings to a three-year low. The metal is poised to snap 12
consecutive annual gains. Banks from Goldman to Credit Suisse
Group AG cut their gold forecasts last week after the  Federal
Reserve  said it may taper stimulus as the economy improves.  “The things that supported gold have begun to crack,”
said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney
Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia, which manages about $58
billion of assets. “Worries about inflation have completely
disappeared with the Fed talking about ending the easing at some
point. As macroeconomic risks diminish, the stool from beneath
 gold prices  has been pulled away.”  Quarterly Losses  Gold futures dropped 23 percent last quarter, the most
since Bloomberg data begins in 1975, and reached $1,179.40 on
June 28, the lowest since August 2010. Traders are divided on
the outlook for prices this week with 15 surveyed by Bloomberg
expecting an advance. Fourteen were bearish and three neutral.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities tumbled
6.7 percent last quarter, the most in a year. The MSCI All-Country World Index of equities slid 1.2 percent. The dollar
rose 0.2 percent against a basket of six currencies. A Bank of
America Corp. Index shows Treasuries lost 2.2 percent. Gold
futures for August delivery rose 2.6 percent to settle at
$1,255.70 today on the Comex in New York.  Goldman expects prices to drop to $1,050 by the end of next
year, 17 percent less than its previous forecast of $1,270, the
bank’s analysts said in a June 23 report. Declines will continue
as the Fed trims its bond-buying program and investors sell ETP
holdings, the bank said. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said June
19 the central bank will reduce its $85 billion in monthly asset
purchases if the  U.S. economy  continues to improve.  ‘Shattering’ Confidence  Bullion’s declines are “shattering” investors’ confidence
and the metal will probably fall to $1,150 in 12 months, Credit
Suisse’s head of commodity research, Ric Deverell, said in a
report June 25. Morgan Stanley lowered its 2014 outlook by 16
percent the same day, citing waning demand for haven assets.
U.S.  consumer sentiment  held close to a six-year high in June,
while economic confidence in the 17-nation euro area improved
more than forecast, separate reports showed last week.  Even if the Fed slows asset buying, countries including
 Japan  and  China  may continue to stimulate their economies,
boosting demand for gold as a hedge against inflation, according
to Martin Murenbeeld, the chief economist at Toronto-based
DundeeWealth Inc., which manages about C$100 billion ($95
billion) of assets.  Japan is making monthly bond purchases of more than 7
trillion yen ($70.6 billion). Bullion priced in yen reached the
highest since March 1980 in April. The People’s Bank of China
will work to maintain market stability, Governor  Zhou Xiaochuan 
said June 28. The country’s benchmark money-market rate fell the
most since 2011 that day. Bullion rose 38 percent since the end
of 2008 as policy makers printed money on an unprecedented scale
to boost growth.  ‘Money Floating’  “With all the easy money floating and some economies
continuing to stimulate, we will see inflation, and gold will
find favor at some point,” Murenbeeld said. “Gold is going
through a mid-cycle correction, but the fundamentals for higher
prices remain intact.”  Money managers pulled $2 billion from gold funds in the
week ended June 26, according to  Cameron Brandt , the director of
research for Cambridge, Massachusetts-based EPFR Global, which
tracks money flows. Total outflows from commodity funds were
$2.68 billion, according to EPFR.  Bullish bets on crude fell 11 percent to 232,194 contracts,
the biggest drop since February, CFTC data show. Platinum
holdings slumped to the lowest since August as prices fell for a
fifth straight month, the longest slide since 2001. Palladium
wagers dropped the most in 11 weeks. The metal tumbled 12
percent in June.  Economic Growth  Investors increased their net-short position in copper to
32,599 contracts, from 29,018 a week earlier, CFTC data show.
Prices fell 7.1 percent in June, the most in 13 months. Goldman
cut its outlook for the metal saying slowing economic growth in
China will crimp consumption. Supplies will outpace demand
through 2016, the bank said in a June 25 report.  A measure of net-long  positions  across 11 agricultural
products gained 5.9 percent to 313,428 futures and options. The
S&P’s Agriculture Index of eight commodities plunged 10 percent
last month, the most since September 2011.  Bullish  corn positions  dropped 5 percent to 70,701
contracts, the fourth consecutive decline and the longest slump
since January. Prices reached a 32-month low on June 28. Soybean
holdings reached the lowest in four weeks. U.S. farmers will
plant more grain than forecast and the largest oilseed crop on
record, the government said June 28.  Planting of corn, the biggest domestic crop, jumped to
97.379 million acres, the most since 1936, the U.S. Department
of Agriculture estimates. Analysts in a Bloomberg survey
expected 95.431 million. Wheat acreage reached a four-year high
of 56.53 million and soybeans were sown on a record 77.728
million acres.  “A slowdown in China, coupled with rising supplies does,
not augur well for commodities,” said Jeff Sica, who helps
oversee more than $1 billion as the president of Sica Wealth
Management in Morristown,  New Jersey . “We are in an era of
lower commodity prices.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
