Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , owner of The
Address five-star hotel brand, and Meraas Holding plan to start
an “affordable” hotel chain to cater to the growing demand in
Dubai for thriftier lodgings.  The chain, to be called “Dubai Inn,” will serve a market
driven partly by the growth of low-cost airlines and planned
theme parks in the United Arab Emirates’ second-biggest
sheikhdom, the companies said in a joint statement yesterday.  Dubai needs to augment supply of affordable rooms as the
local market is dominated by five-star hotels, which account for
nearly 62 percent of branded inventory in the city, the
companies said. Almost half of the 42,000 rooms under
construction are also in the luxury segment, according to the
statement. Dubai is bidding to host the World EXPO in 2020.  “The new generation of travelers is more discerning and
value-conscious, and it is important that our hospitality sector
reflect their needs,” Emaar’s chairman  Mohamed Alabbar  said in
the statement. “By creating a robust pipeline of affordable
hotels under the Dubai Inn brand, we plan to attract more
visitors to our city from the fast-growing markets in the Asia-Pacific,  Africa , Europe and the wider Middle East.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
