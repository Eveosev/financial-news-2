Indianapolis Colts safety Joe
Lefeged is being held without bond on a weapons charge, the
 Associated Press  reported, citing Washington D.C. police.  Lefeged, 25, was a front-seat passenger in a  Chevy Camaro 
that fled a traffic stop for speeding in northeast Washington
after midnight, the AP said. A semi-automatic pistol was found
under the front passenger seat.  Lefeged, who was caught when he tried to flee the car, is
being held in the Washington jail pending an appearance July 2
for a preliminary hearing.  “We are aware of the reports regarding Joe Lefeged in
Washington, D.C.,” the Colts said in an e-mail. “At this time,
we will have no further comment on the pending matter until we
gain more information.”  The arrest comes two days after former New England Patriots
tight end  Aaron Hernandez , 23, was ordered held without bail a
second time after being charged with murder for what prosecutors
called orchestrating the execution of a friend.  Lefeged grew up in Germantown, Maryland, a suburb of
Washington, and played college football for  Rutgers University .
He was signed by the National Football League’s Colts in July
2011.  Police didn’t answer a voice mail left yesterday by
