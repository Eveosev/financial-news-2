The U.K. government will bring
forward plans to introduce tax breaks for married couples to
within this year, and Prime Minister  David Cameron  said an
announcement will be made “very shortly.”  The government had previously said it would set out the
plan within the next two years. The announcement will probably
be made in the fall, according to a British official who asked
not to be identified, citing government rules.  “We are going to be putting in place the marriage tax
proposal in law,” Cameron told reporters in Islamabad today.
“We will be announcing plans for that in this parliament,” and
this will be done “very shortly,” he said.  The move, which comes less than a week after Treasury
minister David Gauke wrote to Conservative lawmakers to reassure
them that the tax break will be introduced during this
Parliament, shows Cameron’s keenness to pacify rank-and file
Tories ahead of elections in 2015. Some Conservatives have
suggested the party is losing support partly because it isn’t
doing enough for traditional families.  Cameron made the comments on the second leg of a three-day
visit to  Afghanistan ,  Pakistan  and  Kazakhstan .  To contact the reporters on this story:
