Tire supplier  Pirelli & C. SpA (PC)  has
been asked to attend a Formula One meeting this week to explain
why there were four tire blowouts during today’s British Grand
Prix, Sky Sports reported.  The FIA’s Sporting Working Group will consider the matter
in Paris on July 3.  Mercedes driver  Lewis Hamilton  was leading from pole
position, in front of his home crowd, when his left rear tire
blew out at Silverstone.  “Safety is the biggest issue. It’s just unacceptable
really,” he told reporters. “And to have four blowouts, it
could have happened at high speed, someone could have crashed.”  Mercedes’s Nico Rosberg won the race. Red Bull’s Sebastian
Vettel didn’t finish, because of a mechanical problem, though he
keeps his lead in the drivers’ standings.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
