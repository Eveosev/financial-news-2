France  decided to sell nearly 10
percent of Paris airport operator Aeroports de Paris to a Credit
Agricole Assurances unit and  Vinci SA (DG)  as the government seeks to
shore up its finances amid ballooning deficits.  The French government and the country’s sovereign
investment fund FSI expect to raise 738 million euros ($960
million) by selling a 4.8 percent stake to  Predica , the life
insurance subsidiary of Credit Agricole Assurances, and 4.7
percent to construction company Vinci for 78.5 euros a share,
according to a  statement  on the Finance Ministry’s web site. The
sale would leave the French state as majority owner in ADP with
50.6 percent of the shares.  President Francois Hollande’s government may face a deficit
equivalent to 4 percent of gross domestic product this year,
rather than the 3.7 percent it’s aiming for, the national
auditor said in a report last week. The risk of the wider-than-expected deficit stems from the possibility of receipts falling
short, meaning any stake sales could help fill the gap.  France earlier this year sold a 3.1 percent stake in
aircraft engine maker  Safran SA (SAF)  for 449 million euros and cut
its holding in Airbus parent European Aeronautic, Defence &
Space Co. to 12 percent from 15 percent.  The agreement announced today calls for Predica and Vinci
to keep the ADP shares purchased for at least a year and not to
increase their stakes in the airport operator beyond 8 percent
for at least five years.  ADP shares closed Friday up 0.95 percent at 74.71 euros per
share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
