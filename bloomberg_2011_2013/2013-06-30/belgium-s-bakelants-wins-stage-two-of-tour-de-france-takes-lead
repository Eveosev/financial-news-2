Belgian rider Jan Bakelants of the
RadioShack-Leopard Trek team won the second stage of the Tour de
 France  and took over the overall leader’s yellow jersey.  It was a first Tour win for Bakelants, at the end of a 97-mile course between Bastia and Ajaccio on the island of  Corsica .
He was in a breakaway from the main pack and withstood the
challenge of Slovakia’s Peter Sagan and  Poland ’s Michal
Kwiatkowski to win the stage by a second, and lead the race by
the same margin. The stage included four medium-grade climbs.  Yesterday’s opening 132-mile stage, between Porto Vecchio
and Bastia, was won by Marcel Kittel of  Germany .  It ended amid chaos with crashes near the end and an
incident when the bus of the Orica-GreenEdge team became lodged
under the banner at the finish line. Race organizers initially
moved the finish line back three kilometers before restoring it
to its original place after the bus was removed.  Kenyan-born Briton Chris Froome, second in the Tour last
year, is the bookmakers’ favorite to win for Team Sky in the
100th edition of the race. The 2012 champion Bradley Wiggins,
also of Sky, is absent because of injury.  The 21-stage race ends July 21 on the Champs Elysees in
Paris.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
