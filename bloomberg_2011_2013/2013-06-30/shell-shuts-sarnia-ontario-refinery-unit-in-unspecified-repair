Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  said it is
shutting a unit at its refinery near Sarnia, Ontario.  The unit is being shut for repair, Kristina Zimmer, a
company spokeswoman based in Sarnia, said today in a phone
interview. The shutdown is causing increased flaring and noise,
according to a company statement on its  website.   Shell wonâ€™t identify the unit being repaired, comment on
the effect on production or estimate how long the shutdown will
last, Zimmer said.  The complex, also called the Shell Corunna refinery,
processes about 72,000 barrels of crude daily, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
