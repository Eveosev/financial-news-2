Marcel Hirscher won the men’s slalom
on the final day of the World Ski Championships today in front
of a home audience in Schladming, Austria.  Hirscher clocked a total time of 1 minute 51.03 seconds for
the two runs. Felix Neureuther of Germany was runner-up, 0.42
second behind, and Mario Matt of Austria came third, 0.23 sec.
further back.  It was the first individual gold at the event for Hirscher,
who leads the overall World Cup rankings as defending champion.  Ted Ligety  of the U.S. failed to complete the first run and
so didn’t add to his triple gold-medal haul at the
championships.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
