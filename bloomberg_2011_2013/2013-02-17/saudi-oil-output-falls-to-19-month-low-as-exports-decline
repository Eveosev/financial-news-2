Saudi Arabia’s crude oil output fell
in December to a 19-month low as shipments from OPEC's biggest
producer dropped for a third month and domestic consumption
decreased, the Joint Organisations Data Initiative said.  The kingdom exported 7.06 million barrels of crude a day in
December, the least since September 2011, JODI  reported , citing
statistics the government submitted to the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries. Exports were 1.3 percent
lower than the previous month. Production dropped 4.8 percent in
the month to 9.03 million barrels a day.  Saudi Arabia, which burns oil to produce electricity and
desalinate water, is seeking to increase use of natural gas as
a substitute fuel. By doing so, the government plans to free up
more crude for sale overseas, where the commodity can sell at
higher prices than it does at home.  The kingdom burned 303,000 barrels a day at power plants in
December, the lowest level in 10 months, according to the data.
That is 29 percent less than what it burned a year ago.  Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter, stored
276.6 million barrels of crude within its borders in December
compared with 278.9 million a month earlier, the data show.
Refineries processed 1.73 million barrels a day during the 
month, down by 44,000 barrels a day from November.  JODI, supervised by the Riyadh-based International Energy
Forum, uses statistics supplied by national governments to
compile data on production, imports and exports for oil-
producing and consuming nations. The data include crude oil and
condensates and exclude natural gas liquids.  To contact the reporter on this story:
