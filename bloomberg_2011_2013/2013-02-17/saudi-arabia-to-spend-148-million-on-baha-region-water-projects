Saudi Arabia will spend 554 million
riyals ($148 million) this year on water and sanitation projects
in the south-western region of Baha, the Saudi Press Agency
reported.  The kingdom’s official news agency cited Mohammed Al
Adheid, director general of the water department in the region,
on its  website  today.  Saudi Arabia, the biggest oil producer with the Arab
world’s largest economy, allocated $6.4 billion for water and
sanitation projects in 2013 and is building power stations to
cope with growing demand as well as desalination plants to
supply drinking water to lessen the country’s reliance on oil
exports.  State-owned National Water Co. plans to spend $66 billion
on plants and upgrades over the next 10 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
