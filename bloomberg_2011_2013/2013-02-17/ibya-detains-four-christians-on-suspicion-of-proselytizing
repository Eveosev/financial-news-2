Libyan authorities have detained
four Christians suspected of proselytizing, the spokesman for
the North African country’s military Protective Security Service
said today.  A South African, Egyptian, South Korean and a Swede with a
U.S. passport were detained in Benghazi, the country’s second-
largest city, in the past week, said Huseein Ben Hamid, the
security division’s spokesman. The four had printed 70 books
about Christianity and distributed 25 of them, he alleged.
Attempts to convert Libyan Muslims to another faith are illegal.  Officials at the U.S. and South Korean embassies in Tripoli
declined to comment on the detentions when contacted by
Bloomberg. A phone message seeking comment was left with the
Egyptian Foreign Ministry.  Ben Hamid said the four would be subject to further
investigation in the next few days, after celebrations to mark
the second anniversary of the uprising against the nation’s
former leaders  Muammar Qaddafi .  To contact the reporter on this story:
