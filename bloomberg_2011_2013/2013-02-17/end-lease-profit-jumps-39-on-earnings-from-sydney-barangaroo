Lend Lease Group , Australia’s
biggest property developer, posted a 39 percent increase in
first-half profit driven by earnings from its Barangaroo South
development in Sydney.  Net income  rose to A$302.3 million ($311 million) in the
six months ended Dec. 31, from A$217.8 million a year earlier,
the Sydney-based company said in a statement to the Australian
stock exchange. That compares with a forecast of A$287 million
based on an average of four analyst  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Profit was boosted by advisory fees from two
infrastructure projects in Australia and the sale of businesses
in Europe.  “There were a lot of one-off transactions that were
profitable, but aren’t necessarily going to be repeated,”  Tony Sherlock , Sydney-based head of property research at Morningstar
Australasia Pty, said in a telephone interview. “The margin on
the construction business was also down.”  The shares fell 2.5 percent to A$10.42 at the close of
trading in Sydney, paring this year’s gains to 12 percent.  Lend Lease in July signed tenants and capital partners for
the first two office towers at its Barangaroo South financial
precinct, which helped boost profit by 146 percent in its
Australian development business. The company is also stepping up
developments elsewhere, with approval for a $2.3 billion
redevelopment in London received in January and an agreement for
a A$1 billion mixed-use project in Perth this month.  Profit after tax in the Australian construction business
fell to A$94 million from A$105.4 million a year earlier, and to
A$13.2 million from A$27 million in its investment management
division, Lend Lease said.  Lend Lease will pay a dividend of 22 Australian cents for
the half, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
