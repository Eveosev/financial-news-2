Tod’s SpA  Chairman  Diego Della Valle 
said he has made an offer for  Telecom Italia SpA ’s La7 to
preserve the television channel’s independence.  “My idea is to put together a group of shareholders that
love our country and want to support an important means of
information, guaranteeing its total autonomy,” Della Valle said
in a statement late yesterday. He also said he is open to having
some of La7’s employees participate as shareholders.  Italy’s biggest phone company is selling its media assets
to focus on its main business and help cut debt. Telecom
Italia’s board is scheduled to meet Monday to consider bids for
its  Telecom Italia Media  unit, which owns the La7 channel.  Newspaper La Repubblica reported yesterday that private
equity fund Clessidra SGR SpA and Cairo Communication SpA have
put in bids for the media assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
