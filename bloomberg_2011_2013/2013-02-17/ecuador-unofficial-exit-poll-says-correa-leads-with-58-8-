Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa
is leading today’s national election with 58.8 percent of the
vote, according to an unofficial exit poll by Cedatos Gallup.  Guillermo Lasso, the former chief executive officer of
Ecuador’s second-biggest publicly traded bank, Banco de
Guayaquil SA, trailed Correa in second place with 20 percent of
the vote, Quito-based pollster Cedatos Gallup, announced today
television station Ecuavisa.  The exit poll of 18,000 people, taken today outside of
polling stations around the country, had a margin of error of
3.5 percent, Cordoba said. The National Electoral Council plans
to announce partial voting results after polls close today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
