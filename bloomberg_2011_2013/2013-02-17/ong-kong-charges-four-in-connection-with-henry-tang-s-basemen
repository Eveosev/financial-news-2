Hong Kong charged four people in
connection with the construction of an unauthorized basement at
the home of  Henry Tang , the city’s former second-highest ranked
official.  The four people were charged under a law that prohibits
unauthorized construction and another that concerns the
misrepresentation of facts in documents submitted to the
government, according to an e-mailed statement from Hong Kong’s
Buildings Department.  Tang, a contender for the post of Hong Kong chief executive
last year, lost to  Leung Chun-ying  after his candidacy was
undermined when he said there was an illegal basement at his
home in the upmarket Kowloon Tong district.  The four people charged include the property owner’s agent,
the “authorized person,” the registered structural engineer,
and the registered contractor, according to the statement.
Summonses were issued by the magistrate’s court on Feb. 9., the
Buildings Department said, without saying on whom they were
served.  Tang has received a letter from the Buildings Department
and has handed the matter to his lawyers, Thomas Chan, spokesman
for Tang and his wife, said by phone today. The couple won’t
comment further on the matter as it has entered into legal
proceedings, Chan said.  The case is scheduled to be heard on March 13, according to
the Buildings Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
