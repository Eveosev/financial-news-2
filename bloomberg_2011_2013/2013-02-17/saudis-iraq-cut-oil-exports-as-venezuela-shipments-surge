Iraq and  Saudi Arabia  cut crude oil
exports in December for a second month, while fellow OPEC member
Venezuela boosted shipments to their highest in more than four
years, according to the Joint Organizations Data Initiative.  Iraq , the biggest producer in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries after Saudi Arabia, curtailed exports by 10
percent to 2.35 million barrels a day, data posted today on the
initiative’s website showed. The Saudi kingdom shipped 7.06
million barrels a day in the month, down 1.3 percent from
November, according to the data.  Venezuela increased crude shipments in December by 19
percent to 1.97 million barrels a day, the most since July 2008,
when it exported 2.24 million, the initiative known as JODI
said, citing statistics that member governments submitted to the
12-nation group. OPEC supplies about 40 percent of the world’s
oil.  Nigeria boosted shipments by 14 percent during the month to
2.29 million barrels a day, and Angola raised exports by 5.6
percent to 1.7 million a day. Kuwait’s exports in December were
little changed at 2.06 million, JODI data showed. Algeria’s
shipments slipped 5.5 percent to 685,000 barrels a day,
according to the initiative.  Iran, Libya and the United Arab Emirates didn’t submit
monthly data.  JODI, supervised by the Riyadh-based International Energy
Forum, uses statistics supplied by national governments to
compile data on imports, exports and output for oil-producing
and consuming nations. The data include crude oil and
condensates and exclude natural gas liquids.  To contact the reporter on this story:
