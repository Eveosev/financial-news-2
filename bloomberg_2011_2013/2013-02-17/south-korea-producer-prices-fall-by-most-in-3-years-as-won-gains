South Korean  producer prices  fell by
the most in more than three years as gains in the won made
imported raw materials cheaper and international commodity
prices declined.  Prices tumbled 1.6 percent in January from a year earlier,
the biggest fall since October 2009, after dropping 1.2 percent
in December, the Bank of Korea said in a statement today. They
rose 0.2 percent from the previous month.  Subdued inflation gives policy makers more room to cut
interest rates if necessary to give Asiaâ€™s fourth-biggest
economy a boost as a weakening yen helps export rivals in Japan.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said this month that a reduction is
likely in April, and possible as early as March, depending on
exchange-rate movements and the timing of fiscal stimulus.  The Bank of Korea held benchmark borrowing costs at 2.75
percent for a fourth month last week, ahead of incoming
President Park Geun Hye taking office on Feb. 25. The won rose
about 23 percent against the yen over the past six months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
