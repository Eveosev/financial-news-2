Iran’s navy is building a new base
near its Gulf of Oman border with Pakistan, state-run  Fars  news
agency reported, citing Iranian Rear Admiral Habibollah Sayyari.  Iran’s navy doesn’t yet have a presence in the area, Fars
said. The base is needed to defend national interests and
monitor sea traffic, Sayyari said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
