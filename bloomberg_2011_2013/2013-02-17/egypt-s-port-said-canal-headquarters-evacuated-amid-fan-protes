Hundreds of protesters laid siege to
the Port Authority headquarters in the Egyptian city of Port
Said, forcing workers to evacuate amid concern there will be a
repeat of violence over the past month that left dozens dead.  About 300 supporters of the al-Masry football club marched
on the building, the state-run Ahram Gate website reported. The
protesters called on Port Authority workers to join them,
leading management to evacuate all personnel, the website said.  More than 30 people were killed in unrest that erupted in
Port Said on Jan. 26 after a court sentenced 21 people to death
on charges connected to clashes between fans of al-Masry and al-
Ahly football clubs in February 2012. The latest violence
prompted President  Mohamed Mursi  to declare a 30-day state of
emergency and a curfew in Port Said and two other canal
provinces. The curfew has since been lifted.  Most of those sentenced to death were either supporters of
al-Masry or from Port Said. Residents say the men were
scapegoats and have warned of retribution. More than 70 people
were killed in the stadium, mostly al-Ahly fans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
