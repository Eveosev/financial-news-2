Egyptian President  Mohamed Mursi  has
dismissed his environmental affairs adviser, the state-run Ahram
Gate website reported, citing spokesman  Yasser Ali .  Ali didn’t provide a reason, it said. The adviser, Khaled
Elmeddin, a member of the Salafi Nour Party, told Ahram Gate he
had not been officially informed of the move, and had contacted
the presidency although “no one answered” him.  Elmeddin said he was awaiting clarification on a
supervisory body’s report that maintains he abused his office
for personal gains, the news website reported.  “Maybe they believe that my mere efforts and contacts with
some of the ministers and officials to solve the problems facing
this country and the citizens” are tantamount to abusing the
post, he said.  A spokeswoman for Mursi, contacted by Bloomberg for
comment, said she would reply shortly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
