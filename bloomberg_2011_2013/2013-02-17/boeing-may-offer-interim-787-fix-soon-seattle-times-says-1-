Boeing Co.  may suggest a temporary
fix to improve the 787’s ability to withstand overheating of its
lithium-ion batteries as soon as this week, the Seattle Times
reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the plan.  The plan calls for a titanium or steel box to be put around
the battery cells, and high-pressure tubes to be installed to
vent gases outside the aircraft in case of a fire, the newspaper
said, citing the people.  If the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration were to agree
to Boeing’s proposal, the earliest that the 787 Dreamliners
could fly again with passengers would be May, the Times said,
citing the need for design, testing and certification.  An unidentified government official was quoted by the Times
as saying, “It wouldn’t surprise me if we’re still talking
weeks before everyone is comfortable,” with the option.  The Times story contains speculation, Boeing spokesman  Marc Birtel  said in an e-mail to Bloomberg News, without elaborating.  “The company’s focus is on resolving the issue and
returning the 787 fleet to flight status,” he said in the e-
mail. “We are working tirelessly in cooperation with our
customers and the appropriate regulatory and investigative
authorities. Everyone is working to get to the answer as quickly
as possible and good progress is being made.”  A FAA spokesman wasn’t available for comment when contacted
by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
