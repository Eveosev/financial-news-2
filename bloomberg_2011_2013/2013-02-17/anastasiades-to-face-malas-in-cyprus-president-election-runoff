Nicos Anastasiades , leader of
Cyprus’s main opposition Disy party, won the first round of
presidential elections, falling short of an outright victory, as
Cypriots voted for a new leader amid fears of an economic
collapse.  With all the votes counted, Anastasiades, 66, received 45.5
percent of the vote compared with 26.9 percent for  Stavros Malas , who was backed by the communist Akel party of outgoing
president  Demetris Christofias . Anastasiades and Malas will face
off in a runoff on Feb. 24.  Independent candidate  George Lillikas  placed third with 25
percent.  Cyprus’s new president faces the challenge of reviving
stalled talks with the European Union on a financial rescue to
save the island nation from a financial collapse. Cyprus has
been negotiating for eight months with the so-called troika of
the European Commission, European Central Bank and International
Monetary Fund over terms of a bailout, which could equal the
size of its 18 billion-euro ($24 billion) economy.  The country, which became the fifth euro-area member to
request international financial aid in June 2012, has been shut
out of debt markets for almost two years, with lenders including
 Bank of Cyprus Plc  and Cyprus Popular Bank Plc losing 4.5
billion euros in Greece’s debt restructuring last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
