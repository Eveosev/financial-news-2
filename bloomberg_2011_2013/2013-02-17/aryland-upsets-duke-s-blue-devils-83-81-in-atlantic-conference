Seth Allen made two free-throws with
2.8 seconds left to break a tie and give the University of
Maryland an 83-81 home victory over second-ranked Duke
University in men’s college basketball.  With 17 seconds remaining in the game, Duke’s Rasheed
Sulaimon tied the score at 81-81 after hitting three free throws
at Comcast Center in College Park, Maryland. Quinn Cook then
fouled Allen who made both shots from the stripe for the win. A
30-footer from Cook bounced off the back rim at the buzzer,
ending a six-game winning streak for the Blue Devils.  “I told our players before the game, there’s a lot of
pride in Maryland basketball,” coach Mark Turgeon told
reporters. “There’s also a lot of passion about Maryland
basketball. We talked about playing with those two things for us
and for our fans. Our fans were just tremendous.”  The Terrapins improved to 18-7 overall and 6-6 in the
Atlantic Coast Conference, while Duke fell to 22-3 and 9-3 in
the conference.  Alex Len had 19 points and nine rebounds for Maryland, and
Allen scored 16. Seth Curry scored 25 points, Cook added 18 and
Sulaimon contributed 16 for the Blue Devils.  In other games involving top-five teams last night, No. 1
Indiana beat Purdue 83-55 and No. 5 Gonzaga took San Francisco
71-61.  To contact the reporter on this story:
