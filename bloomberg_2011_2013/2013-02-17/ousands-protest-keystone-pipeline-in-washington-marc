Thousands of protesters marched to the White House yesterday in opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline, which environmental groups say would worsen the risks of  climate change  by encouraging development of Alberta’s oil sands.  The rally attracted 35,000 people, according to organizers, who called it the largest climate-change protest in U.S. history. They said it marked the rise of a national movement demanding action on global warming as President  Barack Obama  weighs whether to approve the $5.3 billion pipeline.  “Twenty-five years from now, nobody is going to look back at our era and say, ‘Boy, I wonder how that fiscal cliff thing came out,’”  Bill McKibben , founder of 350.org, an environmental group dedicated to fighting climate change and one of the sponsors of the rally, told reporters before the event. “Everyone is going to look back and say, ‘Well, the Arctic melted, and then what did you do?’”  The rally should show Obama that he has “the support he needs to block this pipeline,” McKibben said.  The project would cross six states and link Alberta’s oil sands to refineries along the Gulf Coast. The U.S. State Department is reviewing the pipeline because it crosses an international border. Secretary of State  John Kerry  has said that the review will be completed soon.  In January 2012 the Obama administration rejected a proposed route for the pipeline after concerns were raised about the impact of the project on an ecologically sensitive area in  Nebraska . The route now under consideration was submitted in September 2012.  Environmental Symbol  Environmentalists oppose the pipeline because it would encourage development of Alberta’s oil sands, the mining of which releases more carbon dioxide, which most scientists believe is a greenhouse gas, than conventional drilling.  TransCanada Corp.’s project has become a symbol of a larger fight over environmental protection and economic development in the same way drilling in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was a decade ago.  “It will be a punch in the gut to all the activists who worked so hard to get the president elected” if Keystone is approved, said  Michael Brune , the executive director of the  Sierra Club , a San Francisco-based environmental group that also sponsored yesterday’s protest.  Supporters in the oil industry said the project will create thousands of jobs and improve U.S. energy security by reducing the need to import oil from less friendly countries.  Wind Chill  Obama was playing golf in  Florida  as marchers in Washington coped with biting winds and near-freezing temperatures. American flags and flags with pictures of the Earth on them whipped in the wind, which the  National Weather Service  said reached more than 30 miles per hour at times, dropping the wind chill to 21 degrees Fahrenheit (-6 degrees Celsius).  Protesters filled an area on the National Mall near the  Washington  Monument, carrying signs urging Obama to reject the pipeline. “Tar Sands = Game Over” read one.  Claire Silvers, 62, said she came by bus from Cambridge,  Massachusetts , hoping to demonstrate widespread support for action on climate change.  Sarah Fuelleman of Madison, Wisconsin, said she took a bus to Chicago and then a train for 17-1/2 hours to Washington. “It’s been raining in Wisconsin in January,” she said. “I can’t imagine having people suffer from the realities of climate change.”  Presidential Pledges  Environmentalists have been encouraged by Obama’s pledges in recent weeks to tackle global-warming risks -- first in his inaugural address and then again last week in the  State of the Union  speech, telling Congress: “We must do more to combat climate change.”  Last week Senators  Barbara Boxer , a California Democrat, and  Bernie Sanders , a Vermont independent, introduced legislation that would tax  carbon emissions .  In 2010, Senate Republicans blocked action of climate-change legislation that the House, then controlled by Democrats, had passed. Many Republicans oppose federal efforts to limit carbon emissions, contending that doing so would hurt the economy.  “I think the polluting industries pretty much have Congress locked up in terms of being able to do anything on our own,” Senator  Sheldon Whitehouse , a Rhode Island Democrat who attended yesterday’s rally, said in an interview. “That’s one of the reasons today is important -- because it reflects the voices of people across the nation that they’re fed up with the barricade in Washington and that this is an issue that can’t be overlooked.”  To contact the reporter on this story: Jim Snyder in Washington at  jsnyder24@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at  jmorgan97@bloomberg.net
