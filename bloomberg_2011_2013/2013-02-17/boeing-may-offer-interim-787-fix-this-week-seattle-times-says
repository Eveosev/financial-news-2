Boeing Co.  may suggest a temporary
fix to improve the 787’s ability to withstand overheating of its
lithium-ion batteries as soon as this week, the Seattle Times
reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the plan.  The plan calls for a titanium or steel box to be put around
the battery cells, and high-pressure tubes to be installed to
vent gases outside the aircraft in case of a fire, the newspaper
said, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.  If the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration were to agree
to Boeing’s proposal, the earliest that the 787 Dreamliners
could fly again with passengers would be May, the Times said,
citing the need for design, testing and certification.  An unidentified government official was quoted by the Times
as saying, “It wouldn’t surprise me if we’re still talking
weeks before everyone is comfortable,” with the option.  Boeing spokesman  Marc Birtel  told the newspaper the company
is confident in the safety and reliability of the batteries and
is making “good progress” in solving the problem with
overheating and fires.  Birtel didn’t immediately reply to a voicemail and e-mail
sent by Bloomberg News seeking comment. A FAA spokesman wasn’t
immediately available for comment when contacted by Bloomberg
News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
