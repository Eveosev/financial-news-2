Abu Dhabi’s  benchmark stock index 
advanced to the highest level in more than three years as the
emirate’s two biggest real-estate companies prepare to meet this
week to vote on a merger.  Aldar Properties PJSC  surged 5 percent and  Sorouh Real
Estate Co.  gained the most in more than three weeks. The
developers, which were the  most traded by value  on the gauge,
will  hold  shareholder meetings on Feb. 21 to vote on the planned
combination. The  ADX General Index  rose 1.1 percent to 2,968.54,
the highest since November 2009, at the close in Abu Dhabi.  Shares of Aldar tumbled 14 percent through yesterday since
the developer’s board approved on Jan. 21 a plan to offer 1.288
shares for each Sorouh stock in a government-backed acquisition
to create Middle East’s third-largest publicly traded developer.
Sorouh’s stock has advanced 8 percent since the announcement as
investors deemed the terms of the merger to favor the smaller of
the two developers.  “Investors are accumulating before the meeting this
week,” said  Waleed Al Khateeb , Dubai-based senior finance
manager at Daman Securities LLC. “There was some excessive
selling after the merger was approved last month.”  The combination comes as Abu Dhabi tries to revive its
property market after prices fell more than 50 percent during a
crash in the United Arab Emirates. Aldar’s  2012 profit  more than
doubled, while Sorouh posted a  32 percent advance .  Saudi Declines  Aldar’s stock climbed the most since Jan. 8 to 1.47 dirhams
while Sorouh increased 2.9 percent, the biggest gain since Jan.
23, to 1.76 dirhams. About 58 million Aldar shares were traded,
almost triple the three-month daily average.  Elsewhere in the Gulf Cooperation Council, Kuwait’s  gauge 
gained 0.1 percent and Bahrain’s  measure  advanced 0.3 percent.
Dubai’s  DFM General Index  and the  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index  of the
GCC’s most-traded shares slipped 0.2 percent.  The  Tadawul All Share Index  also fell 0.2 percent after a
six-day rally, Qatar’s  QE Index  slipped 0.1 percent and Oman’s
 MSM30 Index  was little changed. In North Africa, Egypt’s
benchmark  EGX 30 Index  decreased 0.4 percent in its third day of
declines.  Israel’s  TA-25 Index  advanced 0.3 percent at the close in
Tel Aviv. The yield on the government’s benchmark 4.25 percent
bonds due 2023 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
to 4.07 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
