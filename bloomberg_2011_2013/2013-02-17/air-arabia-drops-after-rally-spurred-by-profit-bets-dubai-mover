Air Arabia PJSC, whose profit beat
estimates, fell the most in six months on bets this year’s gains
in the Middle East’s biggest no-frills airline were overdone.  Shares of the carrier, which is based in the United Arab
Emirates sheikhdom of Sharjah, dropped 2.7 percent, the most
since Aug. 12, to 89 fils at the close in Dubai. The stock was
the second-most traded on Dubai’s DFM General Index, which fell
0.2 percent. About 34 million of the company’s shares were
traded,  almost triple  the three-month daily average.  Air Arabia’s stock rallied 3.2 percent last week, taking
the airline’s  14-day relative strength index  above 70, a level
that indicates to some investors that a security is poised to
drop. The company, whose shares are gained 9.6 percent this year
excluding today, said yesterday  2012 profit  jumped 56 percent to
420 million dirhams ($114 million), beating the 404 million-
dirham average estimate of eight analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  “A lot of investors had already priced in the results and
there’s some profit-taking,” said  Waleed Al Khateeb , Dubai-
based senior finance manager at Daman Securities LLC.  The carrier proposed a  dividend  of 7 fils a share.  Five
analysts  recommend investors buy the stock, while six have a
hold rating on the shares and one advises on selling them,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
