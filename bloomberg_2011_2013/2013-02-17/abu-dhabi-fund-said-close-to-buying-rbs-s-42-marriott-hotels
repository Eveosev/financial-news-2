The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority
is close to buying 42 hotels managed by Marriott International
Inc. and controlled by the  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, 
according to a person familiar with the matter.  The sovereign wealth fund, also known as ADIA, has been a
preferred bidder since last summer and the sale includes hotels
in London and Edinburgh, the person said, asking not to be
identified because the deal hasn’t been made public.  ADIA  may pay 640 million pounds ($992 million) for the
hotels which RBS acquired after the borrowers defaulted on a
loan in 2011, the Times of London reported Feb. 16, without
saying how it obtained the information. ADIA and Qatar
Investment Authority, the country’s wealth fund, were bidding
for the Marriott hotels, the Sunday Times reported in July.  Erik Portanger , an ADIA spokesman, and Adam Holden,
spokesman for administrators Ernst & Young, declined to comment.
Nobody was immediately available to comment at RBS.  Oil Wealth  Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates and home to
about 7 percent of the world’s proven oil reserves, is seeking
to diversify away from oil by investing abroad. It set up ADIA
in 1976 to manage proceeds from its oil wealth.  ADIA, which doesn’t invest in the U.A.E. or typically in
the Gulf Arab region, had assets valued at $328 billion at the
end of 2008, according to economists at New York-based Council
on Foreign Relations, the latest available data. The fund
manages global investments including equities, fixed income,
real estate and private equity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
