The Iranian government lifted a six-
month ban on the export of pistachio nuts that was introduced to
curb price rises,  Donya-e-Eqtesad  reported, citing officials.  The ban, imposed last week, was lifted on condition that
pistachios be made available to local consumers “at suitable
prices,” deputy Commerce Minister Hamid Safdel said yesterday,
the Tehran-based newspaper reported. Industry, Mines and Trade
Minister Mehdi Ghazanfari earlier said that discussions with
exporters were taking place to ensure the local market will be
well supplied before Iranian new year celebrations in March, the
report said.  Iran produces about 200,000 tons of pistachios annually of
which 70 percent is destined for exports, said Mohsen Jalalpour,
the head of the  Iran Pistachio Association . The industry
shouldn’t lose an important export market when only a fraction
is consumed domestically, he said.  The government’s decision was “unprofessional” as the
restrictions will project an unreliable image of Iran and
strengthen the competition, Jalalpour said. Iran is battling a
drop in value of its national currency and an inflation rate
approaching 29 percent, partly because of U.S. and European
Union sanctions against the Persian Gulf country over its
nuclear program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
