New Zealand opener Martin Guptill
defied injury to help his team beat England by three wickets in
the first match of a three-game one-day cricket series.  After losing the toss, England totaled 258 all out in
Hamilton, Ian Bell making 64 and  Jonathan Trott  68. New Zealand
finished on 259-7. Kane Williamson got 74 and captain  Brendon McCullum  69 not out.  Guptill, limping with a hamstring strain, left the game
after scoring three runs but returned after the seventh wicket
to end on 27 not out, hitting the winning run with seven balls
to spare.  James Anderson took 1-36 to become Englandâ€™s record
international wicket-taker with 529.  To contact the editors responsible for this story:
