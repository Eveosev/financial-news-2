Liverpool beat Swansea City 5-0 in
English soccer’s Premier League today as Reds manager  Brendan Rodgers  secured an emphatic win over his former team.  Steven Gerrard  opened the scoring with a penalty in the
34th minute at Anfield and the other goals came from new signing
 Philippe Coutinho  on his debut, Jose Enrique,  Luis Suarez  and
 Daniel Sturridge  (penalty).  Liverpool had been winless in the previous five games in
all competitions. The club lost its last league game 2-0 at home
to West Brom and went down by the same score at Zenit St.
Petersburg in a Europa League round of 32 first-leg game three
days ago.  Today’s result moves Liverpool up two places to seventh
while Swansea drops one place to eighth. They’ve both played a
game more than other teams.  Swansea manager Michael Laudrup fielded a weakened line-up
as his team prepares for the League Cup final against Bradford
City a week today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
