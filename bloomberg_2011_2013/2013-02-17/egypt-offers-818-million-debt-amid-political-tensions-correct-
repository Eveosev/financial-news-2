(Corrects amount in headline.)  Egypt will offer 5.5 billion
Egyptian pounds ($818 million) at a debt auction today after the
ruling Islamists met with opposition leaders in an attempt to
resolve the political crisis.  The North African country will seek bids for 1.5 billion
pounds of three-month securities and 4 billion pounds of nine-
month notes, according to central bank data on Bloomberg. It
sold similar-maturity bills last week at average yields of 12.87
percent and 13.97 percent, respectively.  Tensions between the Muslim Brotherhood and the secular
opposition, which have turned violent and helped push the local
currency to record lows, may be easing following a meeting
between leaders from both sides yesterday. Saad El-Katatni, head
of the Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party, said he met with
opposition leaders, including Nobel Laureate Mohamed ElBaradei,
to “exchange view points on the current political situation,”
without providing more detail.  Egypt’s pound has lost 8 percent to 6.7304 a dollar since
the central bank started auctioning U.S. currency to local
lenders in December to limit its access as foreign reserves
declined. The dollar’s rate in the black market increased to
7.05 pounds today, according to the state-run Ahram Gate
website. The average yield on nine-month debt has risen 18 basis
points, or 0.18 of a percentage point, this year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the government’s benchmark 5.75 percent
dollar-denominated bonds due in April 2020 rose 11 basis points
last week to 6.77 percent, near the highest level since June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
