The  Association of German Public
Sector Banks , which represents the country’s state-owned lenders
including Landesbanken, said stress tests should count so-called
silent participations as core capital.  “As long as silent participations count as core capital in
the current legal environment, this should also apply to the
 European Banking Authority ’s stress tests,” Stephan Rabe,
spokesman for the VOeB association in Berlin, said in a
telephone interview today.  European Union regulators are discussing plans to prevent
banks from using so-called hybrid capital to determine the
results of this year’s EU stress tests, two people familiar with
the negotiations have said.  Germany  has been pushing to include
silent participations as a form of capital in the tests, Reuters
reported today, without saying where it got the information.  Global regulators last year agreed on tougher definitions
of capital and gave German lenders a transition period to
replace silent participations with different forms of reserves,
Rabe said. Silent participations are a form of non-voting
capital that exists in Germany and was used by the country’s
government to recapitalize lenders including  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  and  Bayerische Landesbank  during the financial crisis.  “We achieved a long transition period in the Basel
negotiations to replace silent participations,” Rabe said.
“And we need that time to build up new core capital.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
