Asian stocks declined, sending the
benchmark regional index to a two-week low, as violence in Libya
tempered optimism in a global economic recovery and Japan’s
economy shrank more than estimated.    Chiyoda Corp. (6366) , a Japanese contractor that gets almost half
of its sales from the Middle East, led declines in the  Nikkei
225 (NKY)  Stock Average, and Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s largest
automaker, sank 1.7 percent in Tokyo. BHP Billiton Ltd., the
world’s biggest mining company, lost 3 percent in Sydney after
copper futures fell. Samsung Electronics Co., South Korea’s No.
1 company by market value, retreated 2.7 percent in  Seoul  after
the central bank increased interest rates.  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index fell 1.5 percent to 136.35 as
of 5:30 p.m. in Tokyo, heading to its lowest close since Feb. 24.
About four shares declined for each that advanced. The gauge
climbed 1.9 percent last week as better-than-estimated economic
data from  South Korea  to the U.S. boosted confidence in a global
recovery, overcoming concern that Middle East unrest will drive  oil prices  higher and slow growth.  “The Libya situation is the biggest market concern,” said
Naoteru Teraoka, general manager at Tokyo-based Chuo Mitsui
Asset Management Co., which oversees about $28 billion. ‘We
can’t know if this unrest will spill over to  Saudi Arabia , or if
Libyan exports will stop. Those would certainly have a negative
impact on the global economy.”  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 1.5 percent. The
country’s gross domestic product shrank at an annualized 1.3
percent rate in the three months ended Dec. 31, more than the
1.1 percent contraction reported last month, the Cabinet Office
said today. The median forecast of 26 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News was for a 1.2 percent contraction.    New Zealand ,  Korea   South Korea’s Kospi Index declined 1 percent. The  Bank of
Korea  raised interest rates for the second time this year after
inflation exceeded its targeted ceiling for two consecutive
months.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index slid 0.8 percent, while  China ’s Shanghai Composite Index decreased 1.5 percent.    Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index retreated 1.4 percent. The
country’s employers unexpectedly retrenched workers in February
as floods and cyclones disrupted hiring in the nation’s
northeast. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index slipped 0.2 percent as the
nation’s central bank lowered its benchmark interest rate and
pledged to keep borrowing costs low until rebuilding from the
Christchurch earthquake revives an economy near recession.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.7 percent
today. The index dropped 0.1 percent yesterday in  New York ,
falling for the third time in four days.  ‘Sense of Uncertainty’  Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi’s forces carried out air and
artillery strikes on central oil facilities as the government
posted a 500,000 dinar ($407,000) reward for anyone who arrests
the head of the rebel leadership council. Oil rose for the first
time in three days in New York as escalating violence in the
North African nation renewed concern that supply disruptions may
spread to the Middle East.    Libya  is chaotic and a sense of uncertainty for the
future is increasing even in countries surrounding Libya,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $450 million in Tokyo at
Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. “It’s hard to know how high
oil prices will go and how much that will damage the economy.
That’s deterring investors from putting new money into stocks.”  Chiyoda, an industrial-plant builder, slumped 4.6 percent
to 682 yen in Tokyo. Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co.
cut its 12-month share price estimate on the company to 570 yen
from 600 yen. JGC Corp., a competitor that gets 34 percent of
sales from the Middle East, lost 2.1 percent to 1,778 yen.  Hyflux Ltd. (HYF) , which has desalination projects in Algeria and
Libya, fell 1.9 percent to S$2.08 in  Singapore .  Oil Risks  Toyota dropped 1.7 percent 3,650 yen. Honda Motor Co.,
Japan’s second-biggest carmaker by market value, slid 0.7
percent to 3,400 yen. Nintendo Co., the world’s largest maker of
video-game consoles, sank 1.8 percent to 23,370 yen.  Risks to a Japanese recovery include higher oil prices that
could depress capital spending and private consumption,
according to Yoshiki Shinke, senior economist at Dai-Ichi Life
Research Institute in Tokyo. Crude oil prices have risen more
than 10 percent this year and are approaching their 2008 peak.  Japanese property developers fell after data from Miki
Shoji Co., a privately held office brokerage, showed Tokyo’s
office vacancy rate rose for a second month in February.
Mitsubishi Estate Co., the country’s largest developer by market
value, dropped 3.2 percent to 1,634 yen. Mitsui Fudosan Co., No.
1 by sales, slumped 4.1 percent to 1,611 yen.  Almost Doubled  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index has almost doubled in the past
two years. It sank to an eight-year low on March 9, 2009,
following the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
in September 2008. The measure extended today’s retreat this
afternoon after Moody’s Investor Service downgraded  Spain ’s
credit rating, with a “negative” outlook.  Gauges of raw-material producers and information-technology
companies led declines among the MSCI Asia Pacific Index’s 10
industry groups, all of which fell.    BHP Billiton  dropped 3 percent to A$44.63 in Sydney.
Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s largest producer of the metal,
declined 3.5 percent to HK$23.50 in Hong Kong. Mitsubishi Corp.,
a Japanese trading house that gets about 40 percent of sales
supplying metals and energy, slipped 2 percent in Tokyo.  Rio Tinto Group, the world’s second-biggest mining company,
sank 2.4 percent to A$80.42 in Sydney after raising its bid for
Riversdale Mining Ltd. by 3 percent to A$3.9 billion ($3.9
billion).  Osaka Securities Exchange Co. jumped 6.9 percent to
460,000 yen, its steepest advance since August 2009, after the
Tokyo Stock Exchange said it aims to hold merger discussions
with the Osaka bourse operator.  Biggest Drop  Samsung Electronics, Asia’s biggest maker of chips, flat
screens and mobile phones, dropped 2.7 percent to 866,000 won in
Seoul after South Korea’s central bank raised the benchmark
seven-day repurchase rate to 3 percent from 2.75 percent.  Elpida Memory Inc., the world’s No. 3 maker of computer-
memory chips, sank 8 percent to 1,107 yen, the most among the
1,203 stocks in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. Texas Instruments
Inc., the second-largest U.S. chipmaker, narrowed its first-
quarter forecast range yesterday.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.5 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 5 percent by the S&P
500 and 1.9 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Shares in the
Asian benchmark were valued at 13.9 times estimated earnings on
average as of the last close, compared with 13.7 times for the
S&P 500 and 11.2 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
