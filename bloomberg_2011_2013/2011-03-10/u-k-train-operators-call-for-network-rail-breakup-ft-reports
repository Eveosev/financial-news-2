Network Rail Ltd., the state-backed
owner of Britain’s railway track, should be broken up, according
the trade group that represents train operating companies, the
Financial Times reported.  Last month, Network Rail announced plans to devolve
responsibility for decisions on maintenance, operations and
other important matters to eight regional directors, the
newspaper said.  That’s not enough, according to the Association of Train
Operating Companies, which says efficiency increases demanded of
the industry require 10 separately owned regional track
companies, the FT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
