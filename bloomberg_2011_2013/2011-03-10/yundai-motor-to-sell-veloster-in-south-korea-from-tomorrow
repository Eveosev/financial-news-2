  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) ,  South Korea â€™s
largest carmaker, will sell its Veloster coupe in the nation
from tomorrow as the company seeks to boost its market share.  Hyundai spent 270 billion won ($242 million) to develop the
car, the Seoul-based company said today in a statement.  The automaker is adding models including the Veloster and a
revamped Grandeur sedan as it seeks to increase domestic sales
after its local market share dropped to 45 percent in 2010 from
51 percent a year earlier.  The 1.6-liter Veloster will cost from 19.5 million won, the
company said in an e-mailed statement on March 1. U.S. sales of
the model will begin later this year, Hyundai said in January.  To contact the reporters on this story:
