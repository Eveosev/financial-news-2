  Helvetia Holding AG (HELN) ,  Switzerland ’s
fourth-biggest insurer, said full-year profit increased 4.8
percent after selling more life policies.  Net income rose to 339 million Swiss francs ($364 million)
from a restated 323.4 million francs a year earlier, the St.
Gallen-based insurer said today in an e-mailed statement. That
compared with the 343 million-franc average estimate of seven
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Helvetia is targeting growth above the market average and
wants to strengthen its position in Germany and  Spain . The
insurer seeks to boost its return on equity, a measure of
profitability, to 10 percent to 12 percent by 2013 from 9.9
percent in the first half of last year.  “Thumbs up for Helvetia,” said Fabrizio Croce, a Zurich-
based analyst with Kepler Capital Markets who has a “buy”
recommendation on the stock. “The company has once again added
market share.”  Gross written premiums rose to 6.47 billion francs from 6.3
billion francs a year earlier, driven by life insurance premiums
which grew 6 percent in 2010. The solvency margin increased to
220 percent, Helvetia said.  “In a challenging environment Helvetia Group once again
improved its profit and turnover in 2010,” Chief Executive
Officer Stefan Loacker said in the statement. “The goal of the
Helvetia 2015+ strategy is to substantially expand our
attractive business portfolio in our current markets.”  Combined Ratio  The insurer’s combined ratio, or spending on claims and
costs as a percentage of premiums, worsened to 94.1 percent in
2010 from 91.3 percent because of weather-related claims and an
increase in claims that couldn’t be charged to reinsurers.
Helvetia aims to keep the measure between 94 percent and 96
percent until 2013 and targets a new-business margin in life
business of 1.2 percent to 1.5 percent.  Helvetia, which restated its profit after booking some of
the commission paid to its sales team in the second half of the
year, proposed paying a dividend of 16 francs a share.  The insurer’s shares have increased 16 percent over the
past 12 months, valuing the company at 3.47 billion francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
