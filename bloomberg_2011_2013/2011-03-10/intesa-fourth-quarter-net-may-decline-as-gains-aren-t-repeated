  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) ,  Italy ’s
second-biggest bank, may say fourth-quarter profit fell after
gains from asset sales weren’t repeated.  Net income probably declined to 358 million euros ($499
million) from 543 million euros a year earlier, according to the
average estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The
Milan-based bank is expected to propose an unchanged annual
dividend of 8 cents a share.  Intesa, which is scheduled to present a new business plan
on April 6, is shedding assets and cutting costs to strengthen
its finances and comply with the Basel III rules.  “The focus will be on the cost of risk, dividend policy
and the reorganization of the insurance business,” Annamaria
Benassi, an analyst at Banca Leonardo, wrote in a Feb. 17 note.  Net trading income may drop to 82 million euros in the
quarter from 129 million euros, while net interest income is
expected to rise to 2.5 billion euros. Loan-loss provisions may
decline 20 percent to 853 million euros. Last year, the bank’s
results were affected by more than 500 million euros of gains
related to the sale of non-strategic assets.  Intesa is scheduled to publish earnings on March 15. The
following is a table of the analysts’ estimates and the year-
earlier results. The figures are in millions of euros.  Q4 2010      Lowest     Highest       Q4 2009  Average     Estimate    Estimate  Net Interest      2,504       2,398         2,605         2,494
