  Las Vegas  Strip gambling revenue
fell 2.5 percent in January in the third straight monthly
decline as the city faces an uneven recovery after a record
gambling slump.  Revenue declined to $482.7 million from $495 million a year
earlier,  Nevada’s Gaming Control Board  said in an e-mail today.  Las Vegas is beginning to emerge from its worst decline on
record in gambling and conventions, after betting fell more than
9 percent in 2009 and 2008.  MGM Resorts International (MGM) ,  Las Vegas
Sands Corp. (LVS) ,  Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN) , and Caesars Entertainment Corp.,
the four biggest Las Vegas-based casino owners, have said the
worst has passed.  Revenue for all  Nevada  casinos fell 0.7 percent to $877.4
million in January, the board said. Monthly proceeds for Clark
County, which includes downtown Las Vegas as well as the Strip,
fell 0.4 percent to $761.4 million.  Convention attendance climbed 13 percent in December from a
year earlier, ending the year down 0.4 percent, the Las Vegas
Convention and Visitors Authority said last month on its
 website . About 37.3 million people visited the Nevada city in
the 12 months through December, a 2.7 percent increase from a
year earlier, and average daily room rates at Las Vegas hotels
gained 2 percent in 2010.  Passenger traffic at Las Vegas’s McCarran International
Airport rose 5 percent in January, according to  Clark County 
Department of Aviation data. Last year passenger traffic fell
1.8 percent. Carriers including United Continental Holdings
Inc.’s  United Airlines  and US Airways Group Inc. have cut
flights to the city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
