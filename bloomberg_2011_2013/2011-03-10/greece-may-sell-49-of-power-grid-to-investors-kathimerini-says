Greece plans to transfer the
transmission activities of Desmie, the country’s state-owned  power grid  operator, to  Public Power  Corp. SA as a wholly owned
unit,  Kathimerini  reported.  The plan allows for the possibility of selling as much as
49 percent of the new unit to investors that aren’t involved in
generating or supplying power, the newspaper said, citing a
draft bill. The proceeds would go toward funding Public Power’s
capital expenditure, Kathimerini said.  Public Power is 51 percent-owned by the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
