  ZincOx Resources Plc (ZOX) , a British
metals recycling company, will invest $250 million to build a
plant to produce zinc oxide in South Korea.  The British company will complete the factory in an
industrial complex in Gyeongju, southeast of the capital Seoul,
by April 2013, the Ministry of Knowledge Economy said in an e-
mailed statement today.  The plant will process 400,000 metric tons of dusts
obtained from the steel-making process, with feed from nine
South Korean electric-arc furnace operators including  Hyundai
Steel Co. (004020) , it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
