Treasuries rallied, pushing yields
on 30-year bonds down the most this year, as a jump in weekly
unemployment claims spurred concern the recovery is faltering
and bolstered demand to the highest level since 2000 at the $13
billion auction of the securities.  Benchmark 10-year note yields dropped to the lowest since
January as stocks tumbled, Moody’s Investors Service cut  Spain ’s
credit rating, China’s export growth slowed, and reports
indicated Saudi police fired on protesters. The  Federal Reserve 
said it will buy $102 billion in debt over the next month under
quantitative easing.  “We got another strong result,” said  Richard Bryant , head
of Treasury trading in  New York  at MF Global Holdings Ltd., one
of 20 primary dealers obligated to participate in U.S. auctions.
“Across the board, there’s been very good demand for new supply
this week. People are nervous.”  The 30-year bond yield dropped 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, to 4.50 percent at 5:21 p.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data, the biggest intraday drop
since Dec. 29. The price of the 4.75 percent security maturing
in February 2041 increased 1 25/32, or $17.81 per $1,000 face
amount, to 104 3/32.  The benchmark 10-year note yield touched 3.36 percent, the
lowest level since Jan. 31. The 2-year note yield decreased six
basis points to 0.63 percent.  The extra yield investors demand to hold 30-year bonds
instead of 2-year notes was 3.87 percentage points, down from a
record 4.02 percentage points reached Feb. 1 on a closing basis.  Auction Yield  At today’s auction, the securities yielded 4.569 percent,
compared with an average forecast of 4.610 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of seven primary dealers.  The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 3.02, the
highest since the auction on Aug. 10, 2000.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 40.7 percent of the bonds,
compared with 43.1 percent in February. The average for the past
10 sales is 38.9 percent.  While the market has viewed rising oil prices as hindering
the economy, a decrease in crude today led investors to exit
bets against government securities even as other investors
continued to buy the debt for safety, according to  David Ader ,
head of U.S. government bond strategy at CRT Capital Group LLC
in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  “There are two trades going on, and they both have proven
to be beneficial to Treasuries,” he said.  Stocks Fall  A drop in stocks pushed the  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
down 1.9 percent, the most on a closing basis since Aug. 11. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index also slid 1.9 percent.  Crude oil pared losses as the  Associated Press  reported
that police in  Saudi Arabia , the Mideast’s biggest producer,
opened fire during a protest rally. Futures dropped 2 percent
after earlier falling 3.6 percent. Prices are up 25 percent from
a year ago.  Bonds rose after the Labor Department reported that initial
applications for  unemployment insurance  increased more than
forecast to 397,000 in the week ended March 5 from 371,000 in
the previous week. The median forecast of 49 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for an advance to 376,000 from a
previously reported 368,000.  The  U.S. trade deficit  widened 15 percent in January to
$46.3 billion, Commerce Department figures showed. The negative  trade balance  was bigger than the most pessimistic forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Fed Debt Buying  The central bank said in November it would buy $600 billion
of  government securities  through June to pump money into the
economy. Over the next month under that program, the Fed plans
to buy $80 billion in debt as well as $22 billion in purchases
related to principal payments from agency debt and agency
mortgage-backed securities, the New York Fed announced today on
its  website .  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  didn’t rule out in
congressional testimony last week expanding the central bank’s
asset purchases, saying he doesn’t want to see the U.S. fall
back into a recession.  Spain’s government bond ratings were cut one level to Aa2
from Aa1, and the outlook is negative, Moody’s said. The cost of
shoring up Spain’s banking industry will be 40 billion to 50
billion euros ($69 billion), more than the government expects,
according to Moody’s.  Moody’s on Spain  The “eventual cost of bank restructuring will exceed the
government’s current assumptions” of 20 billion euros, while
the risks to government finances remain “skewed to the
downside,” the company said in a statement today.    China ’s exports increased 2.4 percent in February from a
year earlier, the slowest pace since November 2009, the customs
bureau reported today.  The U.S. government, facing a record annual fiscal
shortfall and a congressional impasse over financing, had the
largest monthly deficit ever in February.  The gap totaled $222.5 billion last month compared with a
$220.9 billion shortfall in February 2010, according to the
Treasury Department’s monthly budget statement released today in  Washington . Last February’s deficit was the previous monthly
record, government data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
