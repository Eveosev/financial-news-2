European gasoline is being put into
floating storage before consumption peaks in the summer, helping
to push inventories in independent storage to an 11-month high,
according to an industry consulting company.  Stockpiles of the motor fuel in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-
Antwerp oil trading hub rose 18 percent to 1.03 million tons in
the week to today, the highest level since April, according to
data from PJK International BV. Inventories are mainly of
summer-quality fuel, said Pieter Kulsen, PJK’s founder.  “Refiners are starting to produce more gasoline with the
end of the winter,” Kulsen said from Oosterhout,  Netherlands ,
where the company is based. Refineries can adjust production to
maximize output of heating oil in winter and gasoline in summer.  A tanker with a capacity from 80,000 to 90,000 metric tons
is currently being loaded with gasoline for floating storage, he
said. Some traders buy fuel and put it into storage if they can
sell it later at a price high enough to make a profit.  Fuel oil stockpiles rose the most in a year, adding 234,000
tons to 738,000 tons, according to PJK. Traders can’t currently
earn a profit on so-called arbitrage shipments of fuel oil to  Asia , Kulsen said.  The following table shows the weekly inventory changes in
thousands of tons for gasoline, naphtha,  fuel oil  and jet fuel
in independent storage in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp.  1,000 Tons   Change
