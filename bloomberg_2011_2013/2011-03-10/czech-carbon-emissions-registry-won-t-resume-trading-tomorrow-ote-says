The Czech carbon allowances
registry, shut down in January following an online theft, won’t
resume trading tomorrow, said Jiri Stastny, the director of OTE
AS which manages the registry.  The Czech government will replenish the accounts of  CEZ AS (CEZ) 
and Blackstone Global Ventures with some 1.3 million allowances
from the country’s reserves, Stastny said in a telephone
interview. The registry may reopen at the beginning of next
week, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
