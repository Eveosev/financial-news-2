Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said an “independent assessment” is required to
establish the viability of a no-fly zone to ground the Libyan  air force .  “The most important thing is to get an independent
assessment of what is happening in Libya,” Lavrov told
reporters in Moscow today. “We must be certain that the safety
of the civilian population is fully protected,” which hasn’t
always happened when previous no-fly zones were imposed, he
added.    Russia , which backed United Nations Security Council
sanctions on Libya on Feb. 26, opposes military intervention in
the North African state, Lavrov said March 7. “The Libyans must
resolve their problems themselves, not by force of arms but
through political dialogue,” he said, according to Russian
state broadcaster Rossiya 24.  Russia’s top diplomat said that his country was waiting for
the results of a fact-finding mission to  Libya  by UN Secretary
General Ban Ki-moon’s special envoy.  North Atlantic Treaty Organization members are meeting in
Brussels today where they’ll discuss military options in
response to Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi’s aerial and artillery
attacks against rebel-held positions. While countries such as
the U.K. and France have urged NATO allies to consider a no-fly
zone, with the U.S. less enthusiastic,  Germany  and other nations
have expressed concern about the consequences.  To contact the reporter on this story:
