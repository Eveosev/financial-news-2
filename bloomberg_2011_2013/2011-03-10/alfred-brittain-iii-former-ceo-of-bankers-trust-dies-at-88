Alfred Brittain III, the former
chairman and chief executive officer of  Bankers Trust   New York 
Corp. who raised profits by exiting retail banking to focus on
lending to companies and other banks, has died. He was 88.  He died March 5 at his home in Greenwich,  Connecticut ,
according to Ted Hampton, his stepson.  As head of Bankers Trust -- now part of  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  --
from 1975 to 1987, Brittain sold off retail branches and
emphasized merchant banking. Profits soared by 1984.  The company ranked eighth in assets and fourth in earnings
among U.S. banking companies at the end of 1986, the New York
Times reported.  Along with Walter Wriston of Citicorp and David Rockefeller
of Chase Manhattan Corp., Brittain helped represent major banks
in negotiations with New York City and its unions during the
city’s financial crisis of 1977.  Colleagues recalled his kindness toward his workers. He
made a point of eating with his employees in the company
cafeteria at least once a week, walking up to a table and
asking, “Mind if I sit down?” Hampton said.  After noticing the skills of a trader who was also a top-
ranked chess player, the bank began recruiting through U.S.
chess organizations.  An avid sailor, Brittain established client-focused sailing
events that came to be known as the Chairman’s Cup.  He was a director of the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
from 1982 to 1985 and served on the board of Philip Morris Cos.
for 25 years, until 1991.  Banker’s Son  Brittain was born on July 22, 1922, in Evanston, Illinois,
to Alfred Brittain Jr., a banker in  Chicago  and New York, and
Sybil Collins Brittain. He grew up in Winnetka, Illinois.  He graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1941 and from  Yale University  in 1947, after serving in the Pacific theater
during World War II.  He joined Bankers Trust’s credit department in 1947 and
worked his way to the top of the bank’s international
department. When he was named president in 1966, he became, at
43, the youngest president of a major  New York City  bank, the
Times reported.  Brittain is survived by his wife, the former May Sandoz
McDonnell, and two children from his first marriage -- a son,
Stephen, and a daughter, Linda. His first wife, the former
Beatrice Memhard, died in 1988. His second wife, the former Lill
Middleton Hampton, died in 1993.  To contact the reporter on this story:
