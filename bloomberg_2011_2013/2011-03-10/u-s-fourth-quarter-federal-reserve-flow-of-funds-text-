Following is the text
from the  Federal Reserve ’s flow of funds report.  Debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors is
estimated to have expanded at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of about 5 percent in the fourth quarter of
2010, after an increase of 4¼ percent in the previous
quarter. Private debt edged up 1¼ percent at an
annual rate in the fourth quarter, while government
debt increased 12¾ percent.  Household debt declined ½ percent in the fourth
quarter; it has contracted each quarter since 2008:Q1.
Home mortgage debt fell at an annual rate of 1¼
percent in the fourth quarter, compared to an average
decline of more than 2½ percent during the previous
four quarters. Consumer credit rose 2 percent at an
annual rate, retracing the previous quarter’s decline.
Nonfinancial business debt rose 3½ percent in the
fourth quarter, on the heels of a 2¼ percent increase
in the third quarter. Corporate bonds outstanding
posted strong increases in both the third and fourth
quarters, more than offsetting declines in commercial
mortgages and commercial paper outstanding.  State and local government debt rose about 8 percent
at an annual rate in the fourth quarter, after a 5½
percent increase in the third quarter. Federal
government debt increased at an annual rate of
14½ percent in the fourth quarter; for 2010 as a
whole, federal government debt grew a bit more than
20 percent.  At the end of the fourth quarter of 2010, the level of
domestic nonfinancial debt outstanding was $36.3
trillion;  household debt  was $13.4 trillion,
nonfinancial business debt was $11.1 trillion, and
total government debt was $11.9 trillion.
Household net worth--the difference between the
value of assets and liabilities--was an estimated
$56.8 trillion at the end of the fourth quarter, up
about $2.1 trillion from the end of the previous
quarter.  Growth of Domestic Nonfinancial Debt  Percentage changes; quarterly data are seasonally adjusted
