China will have a copper supply
deficit of 2.44 million metric tons this year, widening from
2010, the  Ministry of Commerce  said.  Refined copper imports are expected to remain at a
“relatively high level” in 2011, the ministry’s Foreign Trade
Department said in a  report  dated March 7. The report did not
specify an exact figure for imports this year or give a
comparison for the deficit in 2010.  An additional 920,000 tons of lead-smelting capacity will
come onstream in 2011, resulting in an even tighter lead ore
market, and higher imports, the report said. The ministry also
forecast the nation’s stainless steel output to grow 5 percent
to near 12 million tons.  In other metals, tin consumption rose 11 percent to 147,000
tons in 2010, as demand for the soldering material from the
electronics sector surged, according to the report.  --Helen Sun. Editors:  Richard Dobson ,  Matthew Oakley   To contact the Bloomberg News staffs on this story:
