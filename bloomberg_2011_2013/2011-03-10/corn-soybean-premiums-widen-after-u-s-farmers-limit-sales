Cash premiums for corn and soybeans
shipped this month to terminals near  New Orleans  widened
relative to Chicago futures as U.S. farmers limited sales
following a price slump this week.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered in March
at  Gulf of Mexico  ports was 52 cents to 57 cents a bushel above
May futures, compared with 52 cents yesterday, U.S. Department
of Agriculture  data  show. The soybean basis was 66 cents to 86
cents a bushel above May futures, compared with 66 cents to 75
cents, the USDA said.  “It’s probably been the slowest week of farmer sales in
more than a month,” said Bryce Stremming, a commodity risk
consultant for Mid-Co Commodities Inc. in Bloomington,  Illinois .
“Export demand is strong enough that people need some
supplies.”  Corn futures for May delivery fell 18.25 cents, or 2.6
percent, to $6.8275 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
price has dropped 6.2 percent this week.  Soybean futures for May delivery rose 6.5 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $13.555 a bushel. The oilseed dropped 4.6 percent in
the previous three days.  Barge shipping costs have increased as much as 19 cents a
bushel in the past week, Stremming said. Today, the cost of
moving grain along the upper  Illinois River  to New Orleans rose
to 650 percent of the 1976 published tariff rate, up from 498
percent a week earlier, he said.  In the week ended March 5, shipments dropped 29 percent to
411,520 short tons from a week earlier and were down 45 percent
from a year earlier, the USDA said today in a  report .  “Rising barge freight is raising the bids for grain,”
Stremming said. “There’s increased demand for barges, and high
water is slowing deliveries.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
