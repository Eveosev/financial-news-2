Wheat may open 20 to 25 cents
lower, heading for its biggest losing streak since January,
after the U.S. unexpectedly raised its global stockpiles
forecast today, said  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst at
Northstar Commodity Investments Co. in Minneapolis.  Inventories of the grain will total 181.9 million metric
tons as of May 31, up 2.3 percent from a February forecast, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a  report  today. Analysts
forecast a drop to 177.56 million tons, the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey.  Futures have climbed 55 percent in the past year after the
worst drought in a half-century curbed production in Russia and
wet weather hurt plants in Canada and Australia. Demand for the
grain may decline as prices rise, said  Jason Britt , president of
Central States Commodities Inc. in  Kansas City , Missouri.  “The job of higher prices is to ration the demand side,”
Britt said by phone today. “Exports were lowered a little bit
because of the higher prices. You would expect at these higher  price levels , you’d better start having a little bit of a
rationing scenario”  Wheat futures for May delivery fell 11.25 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $7.475 a bushel by 7:14 a.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Prices have dropped for four days in a row, the longest
losing streak since Jan. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
