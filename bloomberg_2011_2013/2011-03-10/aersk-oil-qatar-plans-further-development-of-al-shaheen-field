Maersk Oil Qatar, a unit of A.P.
Moller Maersk A/S, will devise a plan this year to extend the
life of the Persian Gulf country’s largest oil field after
completing a $6.2 billion project to boost its production.  The company is studying Al Shaheen and will prepare a plan
for further development by midyear, Managing Director Lewis
Affleck said in a March 8 interview in the capital, Doha.  Maersk agreed with state-controlled  Qatar Petroleum  in 2005
to more than double the offshore field’s capacity to exceed
500,000 barrels a day by 2009. Qatar Petroleum is currently
limiting output to 300,000 barrels a day, Affleck said.  “We expect in the future to be extending wells into other
areas that weren’t tapped,” he said. “There is still a lot of
potential left in this field.”  Maersk had “some disappointments” with the flow at Al
Shaheen and lowered its daily production expectations, Chief
Executive Officer Nils Smedegaard Andersen said on a conference
call in November.  “We had a few subsurface surprises,” Affleck said. “We
are in the business of managing risk.” Affleck didn’t say what
the maximum capacity of the field is.  Maersk has installed 15 new oil platforms, 300 kilometers
(186 miles) of pipeline and drilled 163 wells, Affleck said.
Fifteen additional wells are yet to be drilled as part of the
expansion agreed to in 2005, he said. In addition, 800,000
barrels a day of water are being injected into the field to
force oil to the surface.  Qatar, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
second-smallest producer ahead of  Ecuador , pumped 820,000
barrels a day in February, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Robert Tuttle  in Doha at
