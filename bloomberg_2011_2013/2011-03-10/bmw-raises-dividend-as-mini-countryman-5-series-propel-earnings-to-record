  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , the
world’s largest maker of  luxury vehicles , reported 2010 profit
that beat analysts’ estimates as customers snatched up the
revamped BMW 5-Series and new Mini Countryman.  Net income last year surged more than 15-fold to 3.23
billion euros ($4.47 billion) from 210 million euros a year
earlier, the Munich-based company said today in an e-mailed
statement. The figure surpassed the average estimate of 2.91
billion euros from 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue
last year rose 19 percent to 60.5 billion euros.  BMW profit was fueled by a 36 percent increase in demand
for the overhauled 5-Series line, which was expanded to include
an extended version for  China . The X1 compact sport-utility
vehicle sold more than 100,000 units in its first full year,
while the Countryman, the Mini brand’s first four-door model,
sold 14,337 units since being introduced in September.  “BMW delivered a strong set of results,” said Jose Asumendi, a London-based analyst with Royal Bank of  Scotland .
“We now need to see BMW building off these results and
profiting from its excellent product momentum.”  BMW, whose shares have risen 79 percent in the past 12
months, advanced as much as 1.36 euros, or 2.3 percent, to 56.94
euros and was up 0.1 percent as of 12:53 p.m. in Frankfurt
trading, valuing the carmaker at 37.1 billion euros.  Record Dividend  The company, which will hold its annual press conference on
March 15, proposed a record dividend of 1.30 euros per common
share, more than four times the 30 cents paid the previous year.  “We are extremely pleased with developments over the past
financial year,” Chief Executive Officer  Norbert Reithofer  said
in the statement. “We now want our shareholders to participate
in this success.”  Luxury-car makers are forecasting sales gains this year on
higher spending in the U.S. and growing wealth in China, the two
biggest car markets.  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , which owns Audi, is adding
shifts to meet demand, Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn said
today in Wolfsburg,  Germany .  BMW targets record deliveries of more than 1.5 million
vehicles in 2011 on demand for the revamped X3 sport-utility
vehicle and 6-Series coupe.  The auto unit’s 2010 earnings before interest and taxes was
8 percent of sales last year, compared with 8.7 percent at  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes and 9.4 percent at Volkswagen AG’s Audi.
The company is targeting an Ebit margin of between 8 percent and
10 percent by 2012.  Fourth-Quarter Surge  Fourth-quarter net income rose to 1.2 billion euros from
163 million euros a year earlier as sales climbed 16 percent to
16.8 billion euros. BMW lifted its auto Ebit margin to 10
percent in the final three months of 2010,  Mathias Schmidt , a
company spokesman, said today by phone.  BMW shed about 800 jobs last year on early retirement,
buyouts and natural attrition, the company said. BMW employs
almost 95,500 people. BMW plans to hire about 1,300 people this
year to support development, purchasing and sales, the company
said Feb. 24.  The manufacturer of BMW, Mini, and Rolls-Royce vehicles is
expanding its lineup to reach a goal of selling more than 2
million cars and SUVs annually by 2020. The carmaker has created
the “i” electric-car sub-brand, which will start in 2013 with
the i3, a battery-powered city car previously known as the
Megacity Vehicle. The company is also planning the i8, a hybrid
supercar based on the Vision Efficient Dynamics concept. The
sub-brand’s models will have a blue ring around the BMW logo.  BMW is also pushing into transport-related services and is
experimenting with short-term rentals as it seeks to appeal to
consumers more interested in gadgets like  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone
than cars. The company started a $100 million venture capital
unit and invested in the MyCityWay Smartphone App.  To contact the reporter on this story:
