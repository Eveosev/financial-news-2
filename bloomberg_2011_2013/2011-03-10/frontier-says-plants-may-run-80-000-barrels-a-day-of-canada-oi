  Frontier Oil Corp. (FTO)  is able to
process as much as 80,000 barrels a day of Canadian crude, Doug Aron, the company’s chief financial officer, said at a
conference in  New York .  Frontier’s El Dorado refinery in Kansas has greater access
to heavy Canadian oil arriving through TransCanada Corp.’s
Keystone pipeline that runs from Northern Alberta to Cushing,
Oklahoma, said Kristine Boyd, a company spokeswoman.  The 135,000-barrel-a-day El Dorado plant can process 30
percent heavy crude and the Cheyenne plant in Wyoming, capable
of running 52,000 barrels a day, can process 90 percent heavy
oil, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
