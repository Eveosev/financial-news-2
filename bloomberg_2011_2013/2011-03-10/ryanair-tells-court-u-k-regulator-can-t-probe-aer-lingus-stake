  Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA) , the Dublin-
based discount carrier, told a U.K. court that Britain’s
antitrust regulator waited too long to start a probe of its
minority stake in Irish competitor Aer Lingus Group Plc.  The U.K.  Office of Fair Trading  behaved “erratically” and
without transparency by deciding to investigate Ryanair’s 30
percent holding in its rival four years after the share purchase
was completed, the airline’s lawyer said today at the
Competition Appeal Tribunal in  London .  “I don’t know why the OFT gambled in such a way; it
gambled and it lost,”  John Swift , Ryanair’s lawyer with
Monckton Chambers in London, said at the hearing. The regulator
“lost jurisdiction and it cannot resurrect it.”  The regulator started the probe in October, saying it must
examine if Ryanair’s stake in  Aer Lingus (AERL)  gives it “material
influence” over a competitor’s commercial policy in a way that
could lessen competition and raise prices for customers. Ryanair
sued in January to block the investigation.  After buying the stake in 2006, Ryanair mounted a public
bid for the rest of Aer Lingus. The  European Commission  in June
2007 prohibited the proposed takeover -- a decision Ryanair
failed to overturn in a European Union court. The U.K. regulator
has said it waited until the dispute was resolved at the EU
level before starting its own investigation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
