Ethanol futures declined a fourth
day in  Chicago  as corn and gasoline dropped on concern demand
will wane amid a faltering economy.  The grain-based additive slipped to the lowest price in two
weeks as corn fell after a government forecast showed global
grain inventories will be higher than expected in February.
Gasoline slid amid reports that showed U.S. jobless claims rose,
the trade deficit widened and  Spain ’s credit rating was slashed
by Moody’s Investors Service.  “There was liquidation in the outside markets to cash,”
said Jason Dirico, senior ethanol trader at SCB & Associates LLC
in Chicago. “Ethanol is still in its infancy, so it followed
the other markets.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery fell 3.6 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $2.507 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
lowest price since Feb. 24 and the longest streak of losses
since Feb. 16. Futures are up 5.4 percent this year.  In cash market trading ethanol in  New York  tumbled 6 cents,
or 2.3 percent, to $2.60 a gallon and in Chicago the additive
decreased 5 cents, or 2 percent, to $2.51, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf increased 2 cents, or 0.8 percent,
to $2.625 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel lost 2.5
cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.675.  Corn futures for May delivery tumbled 18.25 cents, or 2.6
percent, to close at $6.8275 a bushel. It was the fifth straight
drop, the longest series of declines since November. One bushel
of the grain makes about 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Gasoline for April delivery fell 0.76 cent to settle at
$3.0196 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . It was the
sixth time this month prices have settled above $3 a gallon. The
contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  An average ethanol mill in  Iowa  is losing 2 cents on every
gallon produced, while a plant in  Illinois  is pocketing about 5
cents, according to Ag Trader Talk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
