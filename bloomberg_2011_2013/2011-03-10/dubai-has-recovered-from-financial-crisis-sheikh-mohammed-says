Dubai has recovered from the impact
of the global economic crisis, its ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum said.  Government officials should assume full responsibility for
leading the next stage of the city’s modernization and
development, he said in a statement posted on his  website 
yesterday. Officials should work more intensely to facilitate
business for local, regional and international companies and
provide incentives to attract more foreign investment and
capital, he said.  Dubai’s recent past showed the need for a financial
regulatory system to oversee government departments, he said.
Such a system would not put severe restraints on department
officials or be an obstacle for future development, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
