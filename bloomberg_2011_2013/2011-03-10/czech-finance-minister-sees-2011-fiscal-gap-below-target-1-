Czech Finance Minister Miroslav
Kalousek said he expects the 2011 fiscal gap to be less than the
government’s target of 4.6 percent of gross domestic product.  Kalousek, speaking today at a conference in  Prague , said he
is also proposing a “slight” cut in the income-tax rate.  The ministry will not propose an abolition of the dividend
tax, Kalousek said, adding that he wants to solve a question of
double corporate taxation by using “other means.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
