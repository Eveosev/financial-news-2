Oil fell in  New York , headed for
the first weekly decline in a month, after Japan’s refiners shut
processing plants following an 8.9-magnitude earthquake off the
northern coast.  Futures slipped for a fourth day, losing as much as 1.8
percent, after the temblor in the world’s third-largest crude
user. A fire at Cosmo Oil Co.’s oil refinery in Chiba, outside
Tokyo, is spreading, a Fire Department spokesman said. JX Nippon
Oil & Energy Corp. shut its refineries in Sendai, Kashima and
Negishi. Prices had dropped before the earthquake on speculation
the economic recovery in the U.S. may falter.  “Crude had been edging lower since before the
earthquake,” said  Victor Shum , a senior principal at
consultants Purvin & Gertz Inc. in  Singapore . “It depends on
how long the plants are shut but if they are shut for an
extended period that would reduce demand for crude.”  Crude for April delivery tumbled as much as $1.83, or 1.8
percent, to $100.87 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . It was at $101.43 at 4:43 p.m.
Singapore time. Prices are down 2.9 percent this week.  Brent oil for April settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange dropped as much as $2.60, or 2.3
percent, to $112.83 a barrel. The contract has lost 1.7 percent
this week and is headed for the first decline in seven weeks.  Japan’s Refineries  Japan was struck by a 8.9-magnitude earthquake off the
north coast near the city of Sendai at 2:46 p.m. local time. The
country was hit by 10 aftershocks, according to the  U.S.
Geological Survey .  The temblor forced Cosmo Oil to shut its 220,000 barrel-a-
day refinery in the city of Chiba, near Tokyo, after a fired
started at the facility’s storage tanks, said Yusuke Kanada, a
company spokesman. JX Nippon’s three plants that closed have a
combined processing capacity of about 600,000 barrels daily.  Japan consumed 4.42 million barrels a day of oil in 2010,
according to data from the  International Energy Agency ’s Feb. 10
Monthly Oil Market Report.  China  used 9.39 million and the U.S.
19.25 million, the agency said.  Oil fell earlier after the Labor Department said U.S.
jobless claims increased by 26,000 to 397,000 last week from a
three-year low. Economists forecast they would climb to 376,000,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  U.S. Economy  An Energy Department report on March 9 showed crude
stockpiles rose to the highest since 2004 at Cushing,  Oklahoma ,
the delivery point for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S.
benchmark grade. Inventories increased 1.69 million barrels to
40.3 million last week, the highest since the department began
gathering data at the hub.  Total U.S. crude stockpiles rose 2.52 million barrels to
348.9 million, the Energy Department report showed. A 1 million-
barrel increase was projected, according to the median of 15
analyst responses in a Bloomberg News survey.  Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News were split over the
direction of crude  oil prices  next week amid spreading unrest in
the Middle East and signals the global economic rebound is
slowing.  Fifteen of 36 analysts, or 42 percent, forecast crude will
advance through March 18. Fifteen predicted futures will
decline. Six said there will be little change.  To contact the reporters on this story:
