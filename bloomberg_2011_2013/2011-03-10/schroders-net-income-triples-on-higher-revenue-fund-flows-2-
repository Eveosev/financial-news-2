  Schroders Plc (SDR) , the largest publicly
traded U.K. fund manager, said profit more than tripled last
year on higher revenue and record net inflows led by clients in  Asia ,  Europe  and  North America .  Net income rose to 307.9 million pounds ($498.2 million),
or 108.3 pence a share, from 95.4 million pounds, or 34.2 pence,
in 2009, the London-based company said in a statement today.
Funds under management added 33 percent to 196.7 billion pounds.  The biggest stock market rally since 1955 led to record net
inflows of 27.1 billion pounds at Schroders as clients sought to
recover from the global financial crisis by getting better
returns than they could get from bonds or cash. Inflows are
unlikely to be as good this year as Asian and European investors
face tougher times, Chief Executive Officer Michael Dobson said.  “It’s going to be a volatile year,” Dobson said in a
telephone interview.   Interest rates  are going to move only one
way, inflationary pressures are increasing in emerging markets
and heightened political risk.”  Analysts estimate net inflows of about 12 billion pounds in
2011, he said.  The 33 percent rise in assets under management from a year
ago will likely “drive significant further earnings growth this
year,” Numis Securities Ltd. analyst David McCann, who rates
the shares “Add,” said in a note to clients today.  The shares fell 56 pence, or 3.1 percent, to 1,744 pence at
the close of trading in  London , the biggest decline in seven
months. The stock has gained 23 percent in the past six months.  Asset management margins rose one basis point to 63 basis
points, compared with less than 40 basis points a decade ago.
That may fall this year, Dobson said. A drop would show
Schroders is being successful in its strategy of winning
contracts to oversee bond assets, which attract lower fees, he
said. One basis point is 0.01 percent.  Schroders now generates two-thirds of its revenue outside
the U.K., Dobson said. Non-U.K. clients accounted for 75 percent
of net inflows last year, he said.  Schroders raised its full-year dividend 19 percent to 37
pence a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
