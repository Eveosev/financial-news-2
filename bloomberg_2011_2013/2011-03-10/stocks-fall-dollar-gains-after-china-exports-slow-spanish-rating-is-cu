Stocks slid, dragging the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index to its lowest level since January, while the
dollar and Treasuries rallied as U.S. jobless claims rose,
China’s export growth slowed and Spain’s credit rating was cut.  The S&P 500 retreated 1.9 percent to 1,295.11 at 4 p.m. in  New York . The Stoxx Europe 600 Index sank 1.2 percent to 277.88,
its lowest close of the year. The Dollar Index, which tracks the
currency against six major peers, rose 0.8 percent. Crude
slipped 1.6 percent after tumbling as much as 3.6 percent
earlier. Treasuries extended gains after a 30-year bond auction
produced the highest demand since 2000. The euro weakened 0.9
percent as the dollar gained against all 16 major peers.  Investors fled riskier assets after claims for U.S.
unemployment benefits and the  U.S. trade deficit  topped
economist estimates, China’s export growth was the slowest since
2009 and German exports dropped 1 percent in January from
December. Moody’s Investors Service cut  Spain ’s rating by one
level to Aa2, saying the nation underestimated the cost of
shoring up its banks. Stocks extended losses and oil pared its
drop as Saudi Arabia security forces clashed with protesters.  “We may be seeing indications of an economic slowdown,”
said  Donald Selkin , the New York-based chief market strategist
at National Securities Corp., which manages $3 billion. “The
market has been whistling past the graveyard of higher  oil
prices  and consumers pulling back, but now it’s starting to
weigh down on stocks and we’ve probably seen the highs until we
get first-quarter earnings results in April. The only thing that
is going up today is the  bond market  as people run to safety.”  Jobless Claims, Trade  The  S&P 500  fell for the fourth time in five days, with
energy, commodity and financial companies falling more than 2
percent to lead declines among all 10 industry groups.
Caterpillar Inc. and General Electric Co. slumped at least 2.6
percent, pacing losses among industrial companies, and 29 of 30
stocks in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell, sending the 30-
stock gauge down 228.48 points, or 1.9 percent, to 11,984.61 for
its biggest slide since August and first close below 12,000
since January.  The S&P 500 has retreated 3.6 percent from its high for the
year on Feb. 18 amid concern higher oil prices will stifle the
economic recovery. The gauge slid today below its average from
the past 50 days at about 1,301, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The S&P 500 hasn’t closed below that threshold, a
level watched by analysts who make forecasts based on chart
patterns, since Sept. 1. The index has rallied 91 percent from
its bear-market low in March 2009.  ‘Corrective Phase’  “The down move we’re seeing today is a corrective phase
within a longer-term uptrend,” said  Christopher Verrone , lead
technical analyst at New York-based Strategas Research Partners.
“The integrity of the uptrend since the 2009 low is still
intact, but if the 1,294-level on the S&P 500 fails to hold in
the next couple of days, we’ll probably come down to 1,260. And
that’s a range which we would look at as a buying opportunity.”  Applications for first-time  unemployment benefits  increased
by 26,000 to 397,000 in the week ended March 5, Labor Department
figures showed. Economists forecast claims would climb to
376,000, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey.  The U.S. trade deficit widened to the highest level in
seven months as a surge in imports led by costlier crude oil
overshadowed record exports. The gap increased 15 percent to
$46.3 billion, from $40.3 billion in December, Commerce
Department figures showed. Imports jumped 5.2 percent, the most
since 1993, while exports grew 2.7 percent. The deficit was
wider than the most pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  Treasury Yields  The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note slipped 11
basis points to 3.37 percent.  U.S. debt  extended gains after the
government sold $13 billion of 30-year bonds, the final of three
note and bond auctions this week totaling $66 billion, and
rallied further after reports of violence in  Saudi Arabia .  The 30-year bond yield dropped 11 basis points to 4.50
percent. The securities sold today yielded 4.569 percent,
compared with an average forecast of 4.610 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of 7 of the  Federal Reserve ’s 20 primary
dealers. The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing total bids with the amount of securities offered, was
3.02, compared with an average of 2.66 at the last 10 auctions.  The cost of protecting corporate bonds from default in the
U.S. climbed. The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade
Index, which investors use to hedge against losses on corporate
debt or to speculate on creditworthiness, rose 2.5 basis point
to a mid-price of 87.29 basis points, according to index
administrator Markit Group Ltd. The cost to insure debt from
Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
and Merrill Lynch & Co. climbed.  European Shares  Six stocks dropped for each that gained in the Stoxx 600.
Rio Tinto Group and BHP Billiton Ltd. helped lead basic-resource
producers to the biggest decline among 19 industry groups. Home
Retail Group Plc sank 5.9 percent as the owner of the Homebase
do-it-yourself store chain lowered its profit forecast. The MSCI
Asia Pacific Index and  China ’s Shanghai Composite Index tumbled
at least 1.5 percent.  The dollar appreciated against all of its 16 most-traded
counterparts, gaining 0.2 percent to 82.94 yen and 1.6 percent
versus the Norwegian krone. The pound slid against 13 of 16
major peers as the  Bank of England  policy makers kept the
benchmark rate at a record 0.5 percent low.  The Australian dollar depreciated against all but two of
its most actively traded peers after the nation’s employers
unexpectedly cut workers in February for the first time in 18
months as floods and a cyclone disrupted hiring in the nation’s
northeast.  Oil, Copper  Crude oil traded in New York fell 1.6 percent to $102.70 a
barrel. In  London , Brent oil retreated 0.4 percent to $115.43
after sliding as much as 2.1 percent.  Prices rebounded after AP quoted an unnamed witness in the
Saudi city of Qatif saying gunfire and stun grenades were fired
at several hundred protesters, leaving at least one person
injured.  Copper declined 0.4 percent to $4.1975 a pound in New York,
its lowest settlement price of the year.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB index of commodities
slumped 1.6 percent, the most since Nov. 16.  To contact the reporters on this story:
