Irish inflation accelerated to the
fastest in more than two years, led by surging energy costs.  Irish consumer prices rose 2.2 in February from a year
earlier after increasing 1.7 percent in the previous month, the  Central Statistics Office  in Cork said in a statement on its
website today. That’s the biggest gain Nov. 2008. Prices
increased 0.9 percent in the month.  Crude  oil prices  have surpassed $100 a barrel after
protests in the Middle East and a civil war in  Libya  curbed
output. That’s posing an additional challenge for Ireland’s new
government led by Enda Kenny, which took power yesterday, as it
seeks to boost consumption to aid the recovery, while
implementing austerity measures.  Costs of energy products jumped 14 percent in the year and
1 percent from January, today’s statement showed. Consumer
prices, excluding energy costs such as electricity, gas and
fuel, increased 1.1 percent from a year earlier. Clothing and
footwear prices rose 6.5 percent from January.  Based on a harmonized European Union measure, Irish
inflation accelerated to 0.9 percent in February from 0.2
percent in January. That’s the fastest pace since January 2009.  The Irish Business and Employers Confederation said today
that about 70 percent of Irish companies are freezing pay in
2011. About 10 percent of companies may cut salaries, the
Dublin-based lobby group said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
