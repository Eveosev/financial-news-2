  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , Britain’s
biggest mortgage lender, will tomorrow invite five banks
including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and UBS
AG to pitch for the mandate to sell 600 branches, according to a
person with direct knowledge of the situation.  The meeting comes 10 days after Antonio Horta-Osorio took
over as chief executive officer and started a review of the
lender’s operations. The branch sales will also involve the
transfer of Lloyds customers to the purchaser.  Lloyds has to sell the branches by the end of 2013 to
comply with European Union state aid rules following its
government bailout. Lloyds has sold assets, among them its Bank
of Scotland Integrated Finance investment unit, and cut more
than 22,000 jobs since its rescue. The bank plans to shrink its
balance sheet by 200 billion pounds ($321 billion) by 2014.  Spokesmen at Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and UBS in  London 
weren’t immediately available to comment. A Lloyds spokesman
also declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
