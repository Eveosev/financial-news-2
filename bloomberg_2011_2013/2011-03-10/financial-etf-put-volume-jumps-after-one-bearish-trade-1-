Put volume for an exchange-traded
fund tracking financial companies jumped to a one-month high
after a bearish trade that profits if the ETF tumbles more than
20 percent by May.  Investors sold 75,000 of the  Financial Select Sector SPDR
Fund (XLF) ’s May $16 puts while buying the same number of the May $14
puts and May $15 puts, options strategists at Susquehanna
Financial Group LLLP wrote in a report today.  “These investors appear to expect that any move below the
$16 level will be a dramatic one,” the  Bala Cynwyd ,
Pennsylvania-based strategists wrote.  Almost 368,000 puts changed hands today, 2.5 times the
four-week average and 6.7 times the number of calls to buy. The
May $15 puts, May $16 puts and May $14 puts were the most active
and accounted for more than six-tenths of all put volume. The
ETF, which tracks companies such as Bank of America Corp. and
Citigroup Inc., dropped 2 percent to $16.43. It has fallen 4.4
percent since its 28-month high on Feb. 18.  The ETF’s call trades jumped to a three-week high yesterday
after two trades with a strike price 7.4 percent above its
closing level. The fund’s implied volatility, the key gauge of
option prices, for at-the-money options expiring in 30 days rose
to 23.46 from 23.01 yesterday.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
