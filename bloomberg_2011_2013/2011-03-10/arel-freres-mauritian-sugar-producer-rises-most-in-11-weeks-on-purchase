  Harel Freres Ltd. (HFRERES) , a Mauritian
sugar producer, rose the most in 11 weeks after saying it raised
its stake in the holding company that oversees Swan Group, which
has stakes in insurance companies.  The stock advanced 1 rupee or 2.7 percent to 38.5 rupees by
the 1:30 p.m. close in Port Louis, the biggest gain since Dec.
22.  Harel Freres, which also has interests in alcohol and
electricity production, increased its stake in Intendance
Holding Ltd. to 43.8 percent, making it the biggest shareholder
in Swan Insurance Co., the group said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday. Swan Group also has an interest in Anglo-Mauritius
Assurance Society Ltd.  “It is diversifying from its core cane activities and this
could reduce its volatility of earnings going forward,” Imrith
Ramtohul, a senior investment manager at Mauritius Union
Assurance, said in a phone interview from  Port Louis .  To contact the reporter on this story:
