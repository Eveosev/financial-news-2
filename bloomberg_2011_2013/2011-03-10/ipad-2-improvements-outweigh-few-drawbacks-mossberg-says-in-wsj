  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s improvements on the
iPad 2 outweigh its few drawbacks and omissions, Walt Mossberg
wrote in a review of the device published in the Wall Street
Journal.  Mossberg said the changes the company made, including front
and rear cameras, were “generally pleasing and positive,”
while adding that the device worked “very well.” Mossberg
recommends the iPad 2 over other tablets he’s tested for most
average users, according to the review.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
