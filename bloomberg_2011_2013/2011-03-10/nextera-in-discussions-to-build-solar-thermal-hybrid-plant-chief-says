  NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE) , the largest
U.S. operator of wind power, is in discussions with a utility to
build a solar-thermal plant at an existing natural gas generator
to reduce fuel costs and pollution, said Chief Executive Officer
Lew Hay. He declined to name the utility.  “We are talking to another company about integrating solar
thermal into their plant,” Hay said in an interview at
CERAWeek, a conference held by IHS Cambridge Energy Research
Associates in Houston. “We’re seeing a lot more interest in
solar-thermal hybrids.”  NextEra’s  Florida  Power & Light utility last year completed
a 75-megawatt solar steam system to feed its Martin natural gas
plant, part of a plan to add 110 megawatts of solar energy to
the utility’s supply in the state. That plant was completed
under budget and ahead of schedule, he said.  “We have to keep fine-tuning it and learning the best ways
to operate it when the weather gets cloudy,” Hay said. “It’s a
balancing act that we plan to be good at.”  Solar thermal technology could also be added to coal plants
as a way to reduce pollution and fuel costs when the sun shines,
without the loss of reliability that can come from intermittent
sources of energy, he said.  NextEra is based in  Juno Beach , Florida.  To contact the reporter on this story:
