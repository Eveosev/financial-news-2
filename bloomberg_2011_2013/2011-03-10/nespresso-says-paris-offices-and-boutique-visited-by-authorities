  Nestle SA (NESN) ’s Nespresso unit said
French authorities visited its boutique on the Champs-Elysees
and its Paris offices to seek evidence after Ethical Coffee Co.
alleged the brand infringed its patents.  Nespresso rejects any claims that it violated its rival’s
patents, the company said in an e-mailed statement today. Nestle
has sued Ethical Coffee in a separate lawsuit in France alleging
that the competitor is infringing Nespresso patents.  Ethical Coffee said in a statement today that it asked
French authorities to investigate possible patent infringements.
Some Nespresso machines may violate the company’s patents,
Ethical Coffee Chief Executive Officer Jean-Paul Gaillard said
in a telephone interview.  Ethical Coffee and  Sara Lee Corp. (SLE)  last year started selling
their own versions of coffee for Nespresso machines, offering
consumers alternative pre-filled capsules for the first time.
Denner, a Swiss retailer, last week said it will resume offering
Nespresso-compatible coffeemaker capsules after a court in  St.
Gallen , Switzerland lifted an injunction against their sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
