U.S. video-game sales increased 3
percent in February to $1.36 billion, researcher NPD Group Inc.
reported.  Hardware sales gained 10 percent, while software revenue
shrank 5 percent, the Port  Washington , New York-based company
said today in an e-mailed statement. Game accessory sales jumped
22 percent, led by  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s Kinect motion-sensing
controller for the  Xbox 360 .  Microsoft led the home-console category, selling 535,000 of
its Xbox 360 units, the Redmond, Washington-based company said,
citing NPD data.  Nintendo Co. sold 454,000 Wii consoles during the month,
marking the first time the Osaka-based company exceeded 35
million in unit sales in the U.S., it said separately.    Sony Corp. (6758)  did not immediately reveal its U.S. sales
figures for its PlayStation 3 console. The Tokyo-based company
is “having its best year ever,” Jack Tretton, president of
Sony Computer Entertainment America, said today in an interview
on Bloomberg Television.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
