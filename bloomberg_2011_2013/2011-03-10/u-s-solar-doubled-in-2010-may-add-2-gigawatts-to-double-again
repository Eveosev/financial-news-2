The amount of new solar energy
capacity in the U.S. doubled last year and may double again in
2011 because of government incentives, stronger demand and
falling prices, a trade group said.  The total capacity of photovoltaic and solar thermal power
systems that were installed last year reached 956 megawatts,
compared with 441 megawatts added in 2009, according to a report
released today by the  Solar Energy Industries Association .  Installed capacity of residential, commercial and utility-
scale plants may increase by as much as 2 gigawatts this year,
according to GTM Research, which worked with Washington-based
SEIA to produce the report.  “Another doubling of U.S. installations in 2011 is likely,
even in the absence of a substantial mid-year price decline,”
Shayle Kann, GTM Research’s managing director of solar research,
said in an interview.  In total, 878 megawatts of photovoltaic systems and 78
megawatts of solar thermal power projects were installed in
2010, according to the report. The cost was $6 billion, up 67
percent from 2009.  The cumulative total of 2.6 gigawatts of installed capacity
can power more than 500,000 households, the report said.  Largest Market    First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the world’s largest maker of thin-film
solar modules, expects the U.S. to be its largest market this
year, and has 2,400 megawatts of North American projects in its
development pipeline, Alan Bernheimer, a spokesman for the
Tempe, Arizona-based company, said in an e-mail.  A  U.S. Treasury grant program , which reimburses 30 percent
of the costs of installing solar systems, helped drive up the
number of projects, the report said. The installed price of
photovoltaic systems fell by 10 percent for commercial and 8
percent for residential installations last year.  Other countries are cutting their subsidies for solar
systems this year, potentially leading to an oversupply of
panels and further price cuts.  “There is a strange effect where the worse things get in
Germany and  Italy , the more suppliers are going to price more
competitively in new markets, like the U.S., ultimately growing
the market,” Kann said.  California had 259 megawatts of photovoltaic capacity
installed in 2010, more than all other states.  New Jersey 
followed with 137 megawatts, more than doubling from 57
megawatts in 2009 and the highest growth rate.  SEIA represents about 1,000 companies involved in the solar  energy industry , including installers, manufacturers,
developers, financial companies and others, SEIA’s assistant
manager of communications Jared Blanton said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
