The European Union extended an
asset freeze against Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  and his
associates to include “five key financial entities.”  The decision, which becomes effective tomorrow, extends the
EU’s asset freeze to organizations and also adds one person to
the list of people already subject to the sanctions, according
to an e-mailed statement from Brussels today. The names of the
entities and the person will be disclosed tomorrow.  European foreign ministers and North Atlantic Treaty
Organization officials are meeting separately in Brussels today
to discuss options on civil-war torn  Libya . The EU last month
imposed an arms embargo on Libya, froze the assets of Qaddafi
and close associates and barred them from traveling to  Europe .  “The funds and economic resources of the five designated
entities will be frozen and an additional name will be added to
the list of 26 individuals deemed responsible for the violent
crackdown on the civilian population since the 15th of February
and subject to an assets freeze,” according to the statement.  The move will extend EU measures to sovereign-wealth funds
and the central bank, according to four people informed of the
matter. The sanctions will freeze European holdings of the  Libyan Investment Authority , its former Deputy Chief Executive
Officer Mustafa Zarti, the Libya Africa Investment Portfolio,
the Libyan Foreign Bank, the Libyan Housing and Infrastructure
Board and the country’s central bank, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the matter is confidential.  To contact the reporter on this story:
