A group of U.S. House Democrats
introduced legislation to initiate what they called a modest
release of oil from the nation’s reserve in an effort to hold
down fuel prices.  The measure would require release of at least 30 million
barrels of oil, or 4.1 percent, from the reserve, starting
within six months, Representative Ed Markey, a Massachusetts
Democrat, said in an e-mailed statement with four colleagues.  “This bill sends a simple message to the speculators, to
the OPEC cartel, to the  oil companies : it is time to release our
oil to help consumers at the pump,” Markey said in the
statement, referring to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.  Gasoline for April delivery fell 0.76 cent to $3.0196 a
gallon today on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Oil prices  are
up 25 percent from a year ago, due to political unrest that
reached Libya, Egypt, Tunisia, Yemen, Bahrain, Jordan, Oman,
Iraq and Iran.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, advanced
0.5 cent to $3.529 a gallon yesterday, AAA said on its  website ,
the highest since Oct. 4, 2008. The price has advanced for 22
straight days.  The reserve holds 727 million barrels of crude in caverns
along the Gulf of Mexico coast, according to the Energy
Department. The reserve has enough oil to meet U.S. needs for 75
days. It was established to counter supply disruptions after the
Arab oil embargo of 1973-1974. The government has  released
reserve oil  17 times since 1985, most recently in 2008 after
hurricanes Gustav and Ike slammed into the  Gulf Coast , according
to the agency.  Obama, Bush  In August 2008, while campaigning for the presidency,  Barack Obama  called for the government to swap light crude in
the reserve for heavier oil at a time when oil was at more than
$120 a barrel and the average retail price of gasoline was about
$3.90 a gallon. He has opposed tapping the reserve to stem price
rises. When oil peaked at $147.26 a barrel in July 2008,
President  George W. Bush  resisted calls to release oil to drive
down prices.  The price surge triggered “very valid considerations”
among the members of Obama administration about whether to
release some crude from the reserve, Interior Secretary  Ken
Salazar  said yesterday in Washington.  To contact the reporters on this story:
