South Africa’s benchmark stocks
measure dropped the most in 10 months, led by copper producers  Anglo American Plc (AGL)  and  BHP Billiton Plc (BIL) , as the metal’s price
fell to the lowest since December.  The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index lost 2.9 percent to
30,898.94 at the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg, the biggest
decrease since May 20. The index is down 6.6 percent from its
2011 high, reached on Feb. 14.  Copper decreased 1.2 percent to $9,166.50 a metric ton in
London after China said imports of the metal slid 35 percent to
a two-year low in February. China accounted for almost 30
percent of South Africa’s exports to Asia in the first half of
2010, according to the South African Revenue Service.  “The disappointing economic news out of  China  is the
single biggest bad news of the day,” Wayne McCurrie, a
portfolio manager at Johannesburg-based RMB Asset Management,
said by phone. “Without China, there is no growth in the world,
as the major developed economies, with the exception of Germany,
are all bankrupt.”  BHP, the world’s largest mining company, lost 3.5 percent
to 255.18 rand. Anglo American retreated the most since Aug. 25,
losing 3.9 percent to 345 rand. The two stocks account for 24
percent of the All Share Index.    Sasol Ltd. (SOL) , the world’s biggest maker of motor fuel from
coal, slid 4 percent to 356.98 rand. Crude oil sank 3.4 percent
to $100.79 per barrel in New York after a Moody’s Investors
Service downgrade of  Spain ’s credit rating and the Chinese
export data revived concern that the global economic recovery
will slow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
