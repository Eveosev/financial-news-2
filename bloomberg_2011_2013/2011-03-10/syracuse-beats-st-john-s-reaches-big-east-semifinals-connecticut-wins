Brandon Triche scored 22 points and  Syracuse University  defeated St. John’s University 79-73 to
reach the semifinals of the Big East men’s basketball tournament
at  New York ’s Madison Square Garden.  The St. John’s loss came a day after the Red Storm defeated
Rutgers 65-63 in a second-round game that ended in controversy
and led Big East Commissioner John Marinatto to issue a
statement acknowledging “two separate officiating errors.” The
referees in that game withdrew today for the rest of the
tournament.  Syracuse (26-6) advanced to a semifinal game tomorrow
against the University of  Connecticut , which knocked off the
top-seeded University of Pittsburgh 76-74. There are two more
Big East quarterfinals tonight, with Cincinnati playing  Notre
Dame  and Marquette facing Louisville.  Dwight Hardy had 22 points for  St. John’s , which fell to
21-11.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
