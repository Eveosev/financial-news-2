  Egypt ’s deputy prime minister
accused external powers and “remnants” of former President  Hosni Mubarak ’s regime of fueling a “counter-revolution” in
the county.  “This is a planned, methodical and deliberate process,”
Yehya El Gamal told reporters in Cairo today. “Some of the
countries in the region and internationally don’t want Egypt to
remain strong.” He didn’t identify the countries to which he
was referring.  The government has been urging Egyptians to end protests,
resume work normally and cooperate with police as the country
suffers from a crime wave, sectarian tensions and slowing
growth. Two people died and 15 were injured in clashes between
Muslims and Copts in Cairo, BBC Arabic reported yesterday.  “We want productivity to resume and we want foreign
investments,” El Gamal said.  Police melted away in the early days of mass protests that
led to Mubarak’s ouster last month after three decades in power.
The Cabinet said in a statement yesterday that it is expediting
efforts for police forces to fully redeploy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
