Put volume on an industrial
exchange-traded fund jumped to four times the four-week average
on trades betting the share price will decline.  Investors bought 15,000 April $35 puts to sell the  Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI)  and sold the same number of
April $31 puts in a spread strategy, according to a report from
options strategists at Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP in  Bala
Cynwyd ,  Pennsylvania , and data compiled by Bloomberg. Another
5,000 March $36 puts were bought, while the same number of March
$34 puts were sold. The March options expire next week.  Almost 72,000 puts traded as of 1:45 p.m. in  New York , four
times the four-week average. The most-traded contracts were the
April $35 puts, which accounted for almost one-third of all put
volume and rose 29 percent to 58 cents. The ETF dropped 1.7
percent to $36.35.  “It was a one-week and one-month bear put spread on the
industrials,” said Joseph Cusick, senior market analyst at
OptionsXpress Holdings Inc., a Chicago-based online brokerage.
Oil price are high, “potentially impacting consumers. The fear
is that there could be a universal slowdown. Industrials would
be an area that would be, for a period of time, hit if something
like that were to occur.”  The ETF has declined 4.5 percent since its 32-month high on
Feb. 18. Its implied volatility, the key gauge of option prices,
for at-the-money options expiring in 30 days rose to 23.44 from
20.62 yesterday. Oil surged to a 29-month high this week amid
escalating violence in  Libya .  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
