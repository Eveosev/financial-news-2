Advent International Corp., a
global private-equity company, purchased a majority stake in
Ukrainian clinic ISIDA in its first deal in the former Soviet
state.  Advent did not disclose the exact size of the stake it
bought in Kiev-based ISIDA or its price. ISIDA provides
gynaecological, maternity and pediatric care services.  “Ukraine is a key emerging market in Central and Eastern
Europe that has strong demand for high-quality healthcare
services,” Tamas Nagy, the head of Advent’s office in Kiev,
said today in an e-mailed statement.  Ukraine, sandwiched between the European Union and  Russia ,
has a population of 46 million people. ISIDA will open a new
clinic in Odessa this year and plans to open hospitals in
Ukrainian cities with population of more than 1 million people,
said Natalie Polischuk, the director at Advent in Kiev.  Advent International has invested in more than 30
healthcare companies worldwide, including in  Romania ,  Germany ,
and the U.K, according to today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
