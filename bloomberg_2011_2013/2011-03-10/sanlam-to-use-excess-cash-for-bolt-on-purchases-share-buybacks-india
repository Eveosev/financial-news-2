  Sanlam Ltd. (SLM) , the largest South
African-based insurer, said it will spend as much as 4 billion
rand ($579 million) on acquisitions, share buybacks and to
expand in  India .  “We’d like to strengthen our relationship with our Indian
financial-services partners and have earmarked 1 billion rand
with an announcement due in the next month or two,” Chief
Executive Officer Johan van Zyl said in a telephone interview in
Johannesburg today.  Sanlam may spend 500 million rand to boost its stake in its
existing Indian joint venture, he said, adding that an
additional 1.5 billion rand has been set aside for “bolt-on”
acquisitions and 1 billion rand for share buybacks.  Sanlam has businesses in  South Africa , the African
continent, the U.K. and India and plans to expand in southeast  Asia .  The insurer also said today 2010 net income rose 25 percent
to 5.5 billion rand and that it had 4 billion rand in
discretionary capital.  Sanlam fell 15 cents, or 0.6 percent, to 27.35 rand as of

performing stock on the five-member FTSE/JSE Africa Life
