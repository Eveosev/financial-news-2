  UT Bank Ltd. (UTB) , a Ghanaian lender,
rose to the highest in a month as full-year profit rose 32
percent and the bank declared a dividend for 2010.  The stock gained 3 pesewas, or 12 percent, to 28 pesewas by
the 3 p.m. close in Accra, the highest since Feb. 11.  “Investors are quite impressed about UT’s 2010 full-year
performance,” Nii Ampa-Sowa, head of research at Accra-based

Accra. “The bank also declared a dividend of 1 pesewa per share
to be paid on April 29, which many investors are excited
