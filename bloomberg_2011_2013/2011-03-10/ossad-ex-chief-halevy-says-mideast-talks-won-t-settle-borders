Israelis and Palestinians probably
won’t agree anytime soon on clear borders for a new state,
leaving them to maintain current political arrangements for
another generation, former Mossad Director Efraim Halevy said.  Even if Palestinians declare a state later this year and
garner significant support at the  United Nations , the move will
have little practical significance and will probably perpetuate
Israeli’s occupation of the West Bank, Halevy told reporters in  Jerusalem  today.  “People believe in two states for two peoples but do not
believe in the sincerity of the other side,” Halevy said,
presenting an 86-page analysis of four peace scenarios he
published with a panel of academics. “Both governments are bent
on maintaining the status quo because of the dangers inherent in
any change in the situation.”  Middle East negotiations broke down two weeks after they
started in September when  Israel  refused to extend a partial
freeze on construction at West Bank settlements. Palestinian
Authority President Mahmoud Abbas says he will not return to
peace talks unless Israel halts all building in the  West Bank 
and east Jerusalem.  Halevy, 76, who was born in the U.K., wrote about his 40-
year career in Israel’s Mossad spy agency in his 2006 book,
“Man in the Shadows.” He is currently director of the  Shasha
Center for Strategic Studies  at the Hebrew University in
Jerusalem.  To contact the reporter on this story:
