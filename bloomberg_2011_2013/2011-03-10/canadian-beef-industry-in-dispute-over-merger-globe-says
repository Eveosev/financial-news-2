Members of  Canada ’s beef industry
are at odds over the merger of two marketing agencies,
disrupting efforts to sell C$2 billion ($2.06 billion) of beef
to foreign markets, the Globe and Mail reported.  The Canadian Beef Export Federation has been in talks to
combine with the Beef Information Centre, the  newspaper  said.
Last month, the CBEF voted not to proceed with the merger but to
continue with negotiations, splitting the group’s membership.  To contact the reporter on this story:
