President  Barack Obama  and first
lady  Michelle Obama  will meet with students, parents and
teachers today to put a spotlight on efforts to prevent bullying
in schools.  They will be joined by officials from the Department of
Education and the  Department of Health  and Human Services at a
conference aimed at encouraging efforts to prevent bullying.  In a video message posted on Obama’s  Facebook page  and the
 White House  website, the president says that bullying “affects
every single young person in our country.”  As the parents of two daughters, the Obamas say the issue
has personal resonance. “Putting a stop to bullying is a
responsibility we all share,” the president says in the video.  In conjunction with the White House campaign, executives of
Facebook Inc., the world’s most-used social networking service,
will announce today that the company will expand an existing
reporting system that let users report content that they
consider bullying to a parent or a teacher. The company also is
making improvements intended to provide better information about
online safety to its 500 million users.  In October, the Department of Education said that schools
that don’t address the bullying of gay students may lose
government funds for failing to enforce gender-discrimination
laws.  To contact the reporter on this story:
