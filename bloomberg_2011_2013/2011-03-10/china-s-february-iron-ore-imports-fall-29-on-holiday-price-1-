  China ’s imports of iron ore fell 29
percent last month from the January record as a five-day
national holiday and rising prices weakened demand.  Imports dropped to 48.64 million metric tons in February
from 68.97 million tons in January, according to China’s  General
Administration of Customs . The purchases were 1.5 percent lower
than the 49.38 million tons bought a year earlier, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Activity declined as businesses were closed for five
Chinese New Year holidays, which ended Feb. 8. China’s iron ore
prices reached a record last month amid restocking, deterring
buyers expecting prices to drop after the holidays, UC361.com
analyst Hu Kai said.  The price of 62 percent  iron ore  arriving at China’s
Tianjin port fell 11 percent to $171.6 a ton as of yesterday
from $191.9 on Feb. 16, the highest level since November 2008,
according to data from The Steel Index compiled by Bloomberg.    India , the world’s third-largest iron ore exporter, plans
to raise duties on shipments of all grades of iron ore to 20
percent from April 1, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said
last month. The tax increase may further cut China’s iron ore
imports, Hu said.  China’s steel-product exports fell 21 percent to 2.48
million tons last month from 3.12 million tons in January,
according to data from General Customs. The shipment was little
changed from 2.49 million tons a year ago, the data showed.  --Helen Yuan. Editors: Indranil Ghosh, Alan Soughley  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
