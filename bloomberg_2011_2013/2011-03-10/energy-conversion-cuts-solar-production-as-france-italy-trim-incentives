  Energy Conversion Devices Inc. (ENER)  is
trimming production of its thin-film solar products to 25
megawatts in the current quarter following cuts to renewable
energy incentive programs in  Europe , its largest market.  Changes to incentive programs in France and Italy are
driving down sales of its solar panels, the  Auburn Hills ,
Michigan-based company said today in a statement, and may impact
as much as half of its anticipated revenue for its third fiscal
quarter, ending March 31.  Energy Conversion Devices produced 33 megawatts of solar
panels last quarter. It forecast in February production of 27
megawatts to 33 megawatts this quarter and revenue of $55
million to $65 million.  “Recent events have injected disruptive uncertainty into
the markets which is causing financing sources to put projects
on hold,” Mark Morelli, the company’s president and chief
executive officer, said in the statement. “We expect better
visibility on the timing of our projects after the announcement
of the new Italian feed-in-tariff program and the French tender
process.”    Italy ’s government said this month it would reduce its
incentives for solar projects in June. France said in February
that it would cap the size of new solar projects at 500
megawatts, and would create a new tender program for projects of
100 kilowatts to 250 kilowatts.  Energy Conversion fell 78 cents to $2.38 after the close of
regular trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
