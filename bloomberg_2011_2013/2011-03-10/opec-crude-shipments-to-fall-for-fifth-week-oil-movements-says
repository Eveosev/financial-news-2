The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will reduce crude exports for a fifth time
in the four weeks through March 26, according to tanker-tracker
Oil Movements.  Loadings will drop to 23.56 million barrels a day in the
period, down 1.3 percent from 23.88 million barrels a day in the
four weeks to Feb. 26, the Halifax, England-based company said
in a report.  Exports from Middle Eastern producers, including non-OPEC
members Oman and Yemen, will decline 2.3 percent to 17.36
million barrels a day, Oil Movements’ data show.  The shipments may be curtailed because as much as 1 million
of  Libya ’s 1.6 million barrels of daily production may have been
halted by fighting in the country, according to the
 International Energy Agency . Oil climbed to the highest in 2 1/2
years in  London  on Feb. 24 as Libya’s violent uprising reduced
supplies from  Africa ’s third-biggest producer. Brent futures for
April settlement were at $113.69 a barrel at 3:45 p.m. London
time today.  A total of 473.59 million barrels of crude will be on board
tankers in the month to March 26, a drop of 2.3 percent from
484.51 million on Feb. 26, according to Oil Movements, which
calculates shipments by keeping a tally of tanker-rental
agreements. Its figures exclude supplies held on board ships
used as floating storage.  OPEC’s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador,  Iran , Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. Iraq is exempt from the quota system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
