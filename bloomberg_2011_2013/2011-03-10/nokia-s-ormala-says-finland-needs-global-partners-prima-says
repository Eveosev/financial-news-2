  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  technology policy
director Erkki Ormala said Finnish industry needs to integrate
into global business, Prima magazine reported.         “We are no longer living in the old cluster model where
companies built their businesses in Finland and then expanded
them abroad,” Ormala said according to Prima, which is
published by the Confederation of Finnish Industries.  Finland could look to Israel, where small and medium sized
companies are integrated into product development for global
companies, Prima cited him as saying. The Nordic country could
also offer tax incentives and simplify its bureaucracy in order
to compete with countries like  Great Britain  and Sweden for
foreign investment, Ormala said according to the magazine.    Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
