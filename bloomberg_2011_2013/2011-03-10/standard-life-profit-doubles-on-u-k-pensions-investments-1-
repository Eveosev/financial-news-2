  Standard Life Plc (SL/) ,  Scotland ’s
biggest insurer, said full-year profit more than doubled on
higher revenue from fees at its U.K. pensions business and
earnings at its investment-management division.  Net income climbed to 432 million pounds ($698 million)
from 213 million pounds a year earlier, the Edinburgh-based
insurer said in a statement today. That beat the 324 million-
pound estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Financial performance has been strong, with higher net
flows and markets increasing the value of assets and revenues
and leading to growth in profits,” Chief Executive Officer
David Nish said in the statement. “The U.K. in particular
continues to develop rapidly as a result of both regulatory
changes and customer trends.”  Standard Life is investing in new technology and savings
products to replace earnings from life-insurance policies sold
in the 1980s and 1990s, which allow the insurer to book profits
as they expire. The firm is betting that the U.K.’s ageing
population and lower state provision for retirement will help
increase sales of products such as self-invested personal
pensions.  Profit at Standard Life’s U.K. division rose 5 percent to
234 million pounds and income at Standard Life Investments
climbed 41 percent to 103 million pounds.  The insurer raised its full-year dividend 6.2 percent to
13 pence a share, beating the analysts’ estimate of 12.8 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
