Heavy rain in southwestern  Bolivia 
will delay production of potassium and lithium carbonate in the
country’s Uyuni salt flats by as much as four months, said La
Paz-based daily La Razon.  Production will be delayed three to four months because
machinery can’t function in high waters, La Razon reported
today, citing Alberto Echazu, director of Bolivia’s state
lithium mining entity. Bolivia had planned to produce potassium
in July and lithium carbonate in October, La Razon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
