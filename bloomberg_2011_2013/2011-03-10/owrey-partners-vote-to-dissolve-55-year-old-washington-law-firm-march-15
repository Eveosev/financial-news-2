Howrey LLP, the 55-year-old
Washington-based law firm, will cease operations effective March
15, Chief Executive Officer Robert Ruyak said.  Ruyak said an orderly wind down of the firm was the only
“practical alternative” after disappointing financial
performance over the past two years and the resignation of
several partners. The firm sent layoff notices to employees
yesterday.  “This is a very difficult time for our firm, for our
attorneys and for our staff,” Ruyak said in a statement. “Many
of us have spent our entire legal careers at Howrey and remain
proud of what we built.”  More than 140 partners have left Howrey since April, the
American Lawyer, a trade publication, reported yesterday. Howrey
ranked 58th by gross revenue on the American Lawyer’s 2010 list
of large U.S. firms with $480 million in 2009.  A group of partners, associates and support staff, mostly
from Howrey’s Houston office, will join Winston & Strawn LLP,
according to the statement.  Latham & Watkins LLP will advise the firm on its breakup,
Howrey spokeswoman Chris Till said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
