The government of  Guinea  agreed
to authorize 30 foreign-exchange bureaus, Dirus Diale Dore,
the countryâ€™s information minister, said on state-owned Radio
Television Guineenne.  The number will increase gradually as speculation on the
currency, the Guinean franc, will be controlled, Dore said
today, without giving more details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
