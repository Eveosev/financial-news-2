  Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de
Bogota (ETB)  SA, the state-run phone company serving  Colombia ’s
capital, climbed as much as 8.8 percent on speculation the
district of Bogota will decide to sell the company at a
shareholders meeting later this month.  Shares traded in Bogota rose 8.5 percent to 663 pesos, its
highest price in seven weeks, on volume six times its three-
month average, at 12 p.m. New York time.  Discussion of a possible sale of the company wasn’t on the
agenda of the March 22 meeting, according to a filing to
Colombia’s securities regulator yesterday.  The company’s board has recommended that Bogota, ETB’s
controlling shareholder, seek a buyer because “ETB is not able
to generate necessary funds to increase its future value,”
according to a statement posted on the securities regulator’s
website on Dec. 15.  To contact the reporters on this story:
