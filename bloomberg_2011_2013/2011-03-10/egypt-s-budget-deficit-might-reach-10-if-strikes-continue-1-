Egypt’s  budget deficit  might reach
10 percent if strikes continue following the revolution that
toppled President  Hosni Mubarak , Finance Minister Samir Radwan
told reporters in Cairo today.  “The budget deficit has started to increase,” Radwan
said. “Today, as I am speaking, the budget deficit is 8.5
percent.” He blamed “factional demands” by different groups
seeking economic gains. The demands are escalating in an
“arbitrary” and “unjustified” manner, he said.  If the strikes and demands don’t end, growth may slow this
year to 3 percent from 5.1 percent in the fiscal year that ended
in June, he said. Egypt’s economy is reeling under the impact of
the revolt that ousted Mubarak last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
