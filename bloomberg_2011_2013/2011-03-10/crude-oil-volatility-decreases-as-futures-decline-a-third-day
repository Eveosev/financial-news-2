Oil volatility decreased as the
underlying futures contract fell for a third consecutive day,
paring losses after a report that police in  Saudi Arabia  opened
fire on protesters.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 38.1 percent as of 2:00 p.m. in  New York ,
down from 40.8 percent yesterday.  Crude oil for May delivery slipped $1.69 to $103.92 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The front-month
contract, for April delivery, sank $1.68 to $102.70. Prices are
up 25 percent from a year ago. Futures reversed an earlier loss
after the  Associated Press  quoted an unnamed witness in the city
of Qatif saying gunfire and stun grenades were fired at several
hundred protesters, leaving at least one person injured.  In electronic trading today on the Nymex, May $110 calls

barrel is a signal that the benchmark grade will advance,

yesterday. The price of the option advanced 2 cents to 19 cents
a barrel today.  “Investors are taking an active interest in the  call
