Cooperative Bank of  Kenya  Ltd., the
country’s third-biggest lender by assets, posted a 55 percent
increase in full-year profit, beating analysts’ forecasts after
growing its customer base and boosting loans.  Net income climbed to 4.59 billion shillings ($54.6
million), or 1.31 shillings per share, in the 12 months through
December from 2.95 billion shillings, or 0.85 shillings, a year
earlier, Chief Executive Officer Gideon Muriuki told reporters
today in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital. Net interest income, the
money banks earn from interest charges on loans, grew 36 percent
to 9.19 billion shillings, he said.  The median estimate of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
was for earnings per share to increase to 1.30 shillings.  Accelerating economic growth in East Africa’s biggest
economy has encouraged Kenyans to take out loans, open accounts
and demand other financial services, boosting banks’ earnings.
Equity Bank Ltd., the country’s biggest lender by market value,
said last week full-year earnings surged 69 percent, while  Barclays Bank of Kenya Ltd. (BCBL) , the second-largest, said profit
jumped 74 percent over the same period.  The number of customers at Cooperative increased by 60
percent to more than 1.6 million last year, Muriuki said.  Cooperative has 88 outlets in Kenya and is planning to open
a branch in neighboring Southern Sudan this year, Muriuki said
in November. The lender also plans to expand into Uganda, Rwanda
and Tanzania.  To contact the reporter on this story:
