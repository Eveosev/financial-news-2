  Libya  will release crew members of
a Dutch Navy helicopter who were captured after a failed
evacuation attempt on Feb. 27, Libyan state television said.  Libya will hand over Dutch troops who “entered the country
illegally” to delegations from the Greek and Maltese
governments, the broadcaster said today without providing
details.  Forces loyal to Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi , who is
fighting to contain a popular revolt, detained three crew
members of the  Lynx  helicopter as they tried to evacuate a Dutch
citizen and another European near the central coastal city of
 Sirte . The two evacuees were brought to the Dutch embassy in
Tripoli and left the country.  Today’s announcement comes after a week of talks between
the Dutch government and Libya about releasing the helicopter
crew, who flew to the country’s coast from Dutch navy ship  HNLMS
Tromp . The identity of the crew members hasn’t been released.
Dutch broadcaster NOS last week showed a Libyan state television
video of them, including at least one woman.  A spokesman for the Dutch Defense Ministry couldn’t
immediately confirm the release by telephone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
