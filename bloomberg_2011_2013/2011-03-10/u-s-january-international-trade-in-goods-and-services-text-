The following is the text of
the U.S. trade balance report for Jan. released by the
Commerce Department.  Goods and Services  The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, through
the  Department of Commerce , announced today that total January exports
of $167.7 billion and imports of $214.1 billion resulted in a goods and
services deficit of $46.3 billion, up from $40.3 billion in December,
revised.  January exports were $4.4 billion more than December exports
of $163.3 billion.  January imports were $10.5 billion more than
December imports of $203.6 billion.  In January, the goods deficit increased $6.1 billion from December to
$59.8 billion, and the services surplus was virtually unchanged at $13.4
billion.  Exports of goods increased $4.0 billion to $120.5 billion, and
imports of goods increased $10.1 billion to $180.3 billion.  Exports of
services increased $0.5 billion to $47.2 billion, and imports of
services increased $0.4 billion to $33.8 billion.  The goods and services deficit increased $11.7 billion from January 2010
to January 2011.  Exports were up $23.0 billion, or 15.9 percent, and
imports were up $34.7 billion, or 19.3 percent.  Goods (Census basis)  The December to January increase in exports of goods reflected increases
in industrial supplies and materials ($3.7 billion); automotive
vehicles, parts, and engines ($1.3 billion); and foods, feeds, and
beverages ($0.1 billion).  Decreases occurred in  consumer goods  ($0.6 billion); capital goods ($0.4
billion); and other goods ($0.3 billion).  The December to January increase in imports of goods reflected increases
in industrial supplies and materials ($4.4 billion); automotive
vehicles, parts, and engines ($2.7 billion); capital goods ($2.1
billion); consumer goods ($0.9 billion); and foods, feeds, and beverages
($0.5 billion). A decrease occurred in other goods ($0.6 billion).  The January 2010 to January 2011 increase in exports of goods reflected
increases in industrial supplies and materials ($10.7 billion); capital
goods ($4.4 billion); automotive vehicles, parts, and engines ($2.0
billion);  foods, feeds, and beverages ($1.6 billion); other goods ($0.6
billion); and consumer goods ($0.4 billion).  The January 2010 to January 2011 increase in imports of goods reflected
increases in industrial supplies and materials ($12.9 billion); capital
goods ($8.1 billion); consumer goods ($5.0 billion); automotive
vehicles, parts, and engines ($5.0 billion); and foods, feeds, and
beverages ($1.3 billion). A decrease occurred in other goods ($0.2
billion).  Services  Services exports increased $0.5 billion from December to January.  The
increase was mostly accounted for by increases in other private services
(which includes items such as business, professional, and technical
services, insurance services, and financial services), travel, and
passenger fares.  Changes in the other categories of services exports
were small.  Services imports increased $0.4 billion from December to January.
The increase was mostly accounted for by increases in other
transportation (which includes freight and port services), passenger
fares, and other private services.  Changes in the other categories of
services imports were small.  The January 2010 to January 2011 increase in exports of services
was $3.1 billion.  The largest increases were in other private services
($1.8 billion), travel ($0.7 billion), and passenger fares ($0.5
billion).  Within other private services, the largest increases were in
business, professional, and technical services and financial services.  The January 2010 to January 2011 increase in imports of services
was $2.1 billion.  The largest increases were in other private services
($1.0 billion) and other transportation ($0.7 billion).  Within other
private services, the largest increases were in business, professional,
and technical services and insurance services.  Goods and Services Moving Average  For the three months ending in January, exports of goods and services
averaged $163.8 billion, while imports of goods and services averaged
$205.4 billion, resulting in an average trade deficit of $41.6 billion.
For the three months ending in December, the average trade deficit was
$38.9 billion, reflecting average exports of $160.7 billion and average
imports of $199.6 billion.  Selected Not Seasonally Adjusted Goods Details  The January figures show surpluses, in billions of dollars, with Hong
Kong $2.2 ($2.2 for December), Australia $1.2 ($1.2), Singapore $0.8
($1.3), and Egypt $0.5 ($0.7).  Deficits were recorded, in billions of
dollars, with China $23.3 ($20.7), OPEC $9.9 ($8.3), European Union $5.6
($6.6), Japan $5.0 ($5.9), Mexico $4.9 ($4.7), Canada $3.7 ($3.9),
Germany $3.1 ($3.3), Nigeria $2.9 ($2.5), Venezuela $2.8 ($2.0), Ireland
$1.9 ($2.6), Korea $1.0 ($0.7), and Taiwan $0.9 ($0.6).  Advanced technology products exports were $21.1 billion in January and
imports were $28.3 billion, resulting in a deficit of $7.1 billion.
January exports were $4.9 billion less than the $26.1 billion in
December, while January imports were $3.3 billion less than the $31.6
billion in December.  Revisions  For December goods exports and imports on a Census basis, not seasonally
adjusted, were virtually unrevised.  Goods carry-over in January was
$0.2 billion (0.2 percent) for exports and $1.0 billion (0.6 percent)
for imports.  For December, revised export carry-over was virtually
zero.  For December, revised import carry-over was $0.2 billion (0.1
percent), revised down from $0.6 billion (0.3 percent).  Goods and services exports and imports for all months in 2010 were
revised in order to align the seasonally adjusted months with the annual
totals.  Services exports and imports for July through December 2010 reflect the
incorporation of more comprehensive and revised quarterly and monthly
data.  For services exports, the largest monthly revisions were in other
private services and royalties and license fees.  For services imports,
the largest monthly revisions were in other private services and travel.  Services exports for December were revised up $0.4 billion to $46.8
billion.  The revision was more than accounted for by an upward revision
in other private services.  Downward revisions in royalties and license
fees and transfers under U.S. military sales contracts were partly
offsetting.  Services imports for December were virtually unrevised at
$33.4 billion, as downward revisions in travel, other transportation,
royalties and license fees, and passenger fares were mostly offset by an
upward revision in other private services.  Upcoming Revisions to Goods and Services  On June 9, 2011, the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Economic
Analysis (BEA) will release two reports: ``U.S. International Trade in
Goods and Services: April 2011'' and ``U.S. International Trade in Goods
and Services: Annual Revision for 2010.''  With these reports,
statistics on trade in goods on a Census basis will be revised beginning
with 2008, and statistics on trade in goods on a balance of payments
(BOP) basis and on trade in services will be revised beginning with
1999.  The revised statistics on goods and services will also be
included in the annual revision of the U.S. international transactions
accounts (ITAs), which BEA will release on June 16, 2011.  As in past
years, BEA's annual revision of the ITAs will reflect newly available
source data as well as changes in definitions and methodologies.
Upcoming changes in definitions and methodologies are discussed below.  Goods  BEA will revise the adjustments it applies to goods exports and imports
on a Census basis to convert them to a BOP basis.  These BOP adjustments
are combined and presented as ``Net Adjustments'' in this report.  Goods
exports and imports on a Census basis will not be affected by these
revisions.  Beginning with statistics for 1999, BEA will seasonally
adjust BOP adjustments that exhibit statistically significant seasonal
patterns.  In addition, BEA will extend BOP adjustments for low-value
transactions back to 1999.  For more information on goods on a Census
basis and on BOP adjustments, see the Information section on page A-1 of
this release.  Services  BEA will revise the services statistics to continue a multi-year effort
to align the ITAs with the most recent international guidelines for
international economic accounts as released in 2009 in the sixth edition
of the  International Monetary Fund 's Balance of Payments and
International Investment Position Manual.  Additional information on
BEA's 2011 annual revision of the ITAs and plans for implementing the
new international standards will appear in the May 2011 issue of the
Survey of Current Business, which BEA will release in mid-May.  Beginning with statistics for 1999, for both exports and imports, BEA
will reclassify cruise fares from passenger fares to travel, postal
services from U.S. government miscellaneous services to other
transportation, and film and television tape rentals from other private
services to royalties and license fees.  These reclassifications will
have no effect on total services exports and imports or on the services
balance because they will result in offsetting revisions within
services.  However, updated source data and improvements to estimation
methodologies will result in revisions that are not offsetting.  Beginning with statistics for 1999, BEA will remove transactions from
other private services that represent expenditures on goods and services
in the  United States  by foreign nationals working for international
organizations based in the United States, such as the  United Nations  and
the International Monetary Fund.  Because these foreign nationals are
considered U.S. residents according to balance of payments accounting
guidelines, their expenditures in the United States are not treated as
international transactions.  Changes to Country Names and Groupings  Country Names  Effective with this release, the U.S. Census Bureau has altered the
country names used in certain exhibits of the FT900. These changes will
bring the names used in the FT900 and related data products closer in
line with names used by the U.S. Department of State and the  International Organization  for Standardization. The changes are as
follows:  Previous Name                      New Name
Falkland Islands                   Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)
Federal Republic of Germany        Germany
Bosnia-Hercegovina                 Bosnia and Herzegovina
Macedonia (Skopje)                 Macedonia
Republic of Yemen                  Yemen
Burma (Myanmar)                    Burma
Macao                              Macau
North Korea                        Korea, North
Cocos (Keeling) Island             Cocos (Keeling) Islands
Western Samoa                      Samoa

Federated States of Micronesia     Micronesia
Burkina                            Burkina Faso  Country Groupings  Estonia will be included in the Euro area in Exhibit 14 of the FT900 and
Exhibit 6 of the FT900 supplement, effective with this release. The
statistics for prior time periods will not be affected by this change.  SOURCE: U.S. Commerce Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
