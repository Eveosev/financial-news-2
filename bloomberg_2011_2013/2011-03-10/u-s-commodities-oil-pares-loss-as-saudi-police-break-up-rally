Crude oil pared losses after the
police in  Saudi Arabia , the Middle East’s biggest petroleum
producer, reportedly opened fire at a rally in the east of the
country.  New York futures rebounded from a four-month low and Brent
crude,  Europe ’s benchmark, briefly rose after the report on the
gunfire. Oil earlier fell as much as 3.6 percent after U.S.
unemployment claims increased and  Spain ’s credit rating was cut,
bolstering concern that the global economic recovery and fuel
demand growth will slow.  “When the Saudi Arabia story broke, shorts got scared out
of the market,” said  Richard Ilczyszyn , a market strategist at
Lind-Waldock, a broker in Chicago. “The bad economic data
probably led you to believe that growth is not as good as
expected.”  In other markets, corn, wheat and rice futures fell after
the U.S. said global grain inventories will be higher than
expected in February.  Orange juice  also declined. The UBS
Bloomberg Constant Maturity Commodity Index dropped 1.2 percent
to 1,736.97. The gauge slid for the fourth straight day, the
longest slump since late August.  Oil futures for April delivery declined $1.68, or 1.6
percent, to settle at $102.70 a barrel on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The most-active contract traded at $101.50
before reports of the gunfire.  Brent futures for April settlement slipped 51 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $115.43 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe in  London .
Earlier, the price slumped as much as 2.1 percent.  Grains Drop  Corn futures for May delivery fell 18.25 cents, or 2.6
percent, to $6.8275 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. The
price dropped for the fifth straight session, the longest slump
since November.  Bigger corn production than forecast in  Brazil  and more
wheat expected from Argentina and  Australia  led the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  to boost forecasts for global
inventories before harvests this year in the Northern
Hemisphere. World rice stockpiles will be 5.3 percent larger
than estimated in February.  Tighter supplies amid rising demand helped fuel a rally in
crop prices in the past year, as corn, wheat and rice jumped
last month to the highest levels since 2008. The gains boosted
global food prices to a record in February after surging 25
percent last year, according to the  United Nations .  “Production numbers out of some foreign countries are
starting to pick up, and in the U.S., there was a slowdown with
some export business being shifted to other countries,” said
Brian Hoops, the president of Midwest Market Solutions in
Yankton,  South Dakota . “It probably puts less pressure on the
U.S. to produce a big corn crop and a big wheat crop, although
it’s still early in the season.”  Wheat futures for May delivery declined 18.25 cents, or 2.4
percent, to $7.405 a bushel, capping an 11 percent plunge in
four days.  Rice futures for May delivery plunged by the exchange limit
of 50 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $13.05 per 100 pounds, the
lowest since Nov. 17.  Orange Juice  Orange juice fell to a three-week low after the USDA
unexpectedly boosted its estimate of the  Florida  orange crop,
signaling damage from a December frost was less severe than
estimated.  Growers in Florida, the world’s second-largest producer,
will collect 142 million boxes of oranges in the harvest that
began in October and runs into July, the agency said in a
report. That was up 2.9 percent from 138 million projected in
February, marking the first increase in four months.  Five analysts in a Bloomberg News survey projected a crop
of 136.2 million boxes, on average. Two weeks ago, orange juice
reached the highest price since April 2007 after the adverse
weather in Florida in December and January. PepsiCo Inc.’s
Tropicana unit, the largest purchaser of Florida fruit and
juice, plans to raise prices on some products.  “The raised count is so surprising,” said Michael Smith,
the president of T&K Futures & Options Inc. in  Port St. Lucie ,
Florida. “Looking at the crop conditions, I was expecting them
to lower the box count.”  Orange juice for May delivery fell 3.8 cents, or 2.2
percent, to $1.7025 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York , the
biggest drop since Feb. 28. Earlier, the most-active contract
touched $1.668, the lowest since Feb. 16.  Commodities settled as follows:  Precious metals:
