Zimbabwe’s  Supreme Court  has
nullified the election of Parliament Speaker Lovemore Moyo after
his appointment was challenged by an official from President
Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front
party.  “The Supreme Court upheld the application by Jonathan Moyo
to set aside the election of the speaker,” said Xolani Zitha, a
spokesman for Lovemore Moyo, by phone from Harare today. “The
effect of the ruling is that there has to be an election for the
speaker’s position.”  Lovemore Moyo is the chairman of Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai’s Movement for Democratic Change party. He became
speaker of Parliament in 2008 after the MDC won the most seats
in the lower chamber. He was the first speaker who did not come
from the ruling Zanu-PF since the country attained independence
in 1980.  Jonathan Moyo, an ally to Mugabe and former Information
Minister, challenged Lovemore Moyo’s election, saying the vote
was not conducted according to parliamentary rules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
