  Spyker Cars NV (SPYKR) , the owner of Saab
Automobile, said it will reach its sales target for this year of
80,000 vehicles, in a response to comments made by Russian
businessman Vladimir Antonov in a Swedish newspaper.  Saab will sell a maximum of 60,000 to 65,000 cars this
year, Antonov, a former Spyker chairman and shareholder, told
Swedish newspaper  Dagens Industri  today.  The company “has not changed its guidance outlook
statements which were given to date," the Zeewolde, Netherlands-
based company said in a statement. "The views expressed by
Antonov are solely his and do not in any way represent the views
of Spyker Cars,”  Spyker shares fell 7.9 percent to 4.30 euros, their biggest
decline in 13 months, valuing the company at 86.5 million euros
($120 million).  Antonov agreed last month to buy Spyker’s sports-car unit,
helping the carmaker reduce debt. Antonov didn’t answer calls to
his mobile phone today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
