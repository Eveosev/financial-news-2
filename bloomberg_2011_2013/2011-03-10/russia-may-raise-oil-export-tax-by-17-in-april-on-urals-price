  Russia  may raise its export duty on
most crude shipments by as much as 17 percent on April 1 after
Urals prices climbed.  The standard  tax rate  will probably be $424 to $426 a
metric ton, up from $365 a ton in March, according to Bloomberg
calculations based on Finance Ministry data. The discounted rate
on oil pumped via Russia’s East Siberian Pacific Ocean pipeline
to  Asia  and from the  Caspian Sea  may reach $191 to $192.50, from
$150.40 a ton.  Russia sets the duty based on the average Urals price from
the 15th day of one month to the 14th day of the next. Urals,
Russia’s benchmark export blend, will probably average $108.14
to $108.59 during this monitoring period,  Alexander Sakovich , a
Finance Ministry adviser, said today by phone.  The export tax on light oil products may be increased to
$284 to $285 a ton from $244.60 a ton. The duty on heavy
products may be $198 to $199 a ton, compared with $170.40 a ton.
The government changed the calculation for oil-product taxes to
a percentage of the crude levy as it gradually closes the gap
between them.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  must sign off on the duties
for them to come into effect.  To contact the reporter on this story:
