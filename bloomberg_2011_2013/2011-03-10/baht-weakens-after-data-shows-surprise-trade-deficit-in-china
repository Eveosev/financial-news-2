  Thailand ’s baht fell, retreating
from a two-month high, after a report showed an unexpected trade
deficit last month in  China , the country’s largest export
market.  The world’s second-largest economy posted a deficit of $7.3
billion, the biggest in seven years, compared with the median
forecast of a surplus of $4.9 billion in a Bloomberg News
survey. Exports rose 2.4 percent from a year earlier, slowing
from a 37.7 percent pace the previous month. China bought 11
percent of goods shipped from Thailand in 2010, according to
government data.  “China’s data raised concern about a slowdown in its
economy, hurting the export outlook for the region as China is
the major buyer of goods from  Asia ,” said  Minoru Shioiri , chief
manager of foreign-exchange trading at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan
Stanley Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Many Asian economies depend
on exports for its growth.”  The baht dropped 0.1 percent to 30.35 per dollar as of 3:30
p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
earlier touched 30.25, the strongest level since Jan. 7.  Thailand’s consumer confidence fell for the first time in
three months in February after oil and food prices surged. An
index measuring sentiment dropped to 72.2 from 72.6 in January,
the University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce said in a
statement in Bangkok today. Crude prices gained about 21 percent
over the past three weeks.  The onshore one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, fell 5.5 basis points to
2.665 percent. The yield on the 3.125 percent government bond
due December 2015 held at 3.39 percent. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
