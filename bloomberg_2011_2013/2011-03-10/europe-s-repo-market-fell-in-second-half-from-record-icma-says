The size of  Europe ’s repurchase
agreement, or repo, market fell 15.4 percent in the second half
of last year from record levels in the first six months,
according to the International Capital Market Association.  The amount of repo contracts outstanding was 5.9 trillion
euros ($8.2 trillion) in the six months ended Dec. 31, down from
6.9 trillion euros in the previous period, according to a survey
of 53 market participants, Zurich-based  ICMA  said in a statement
today.  In a repo, companies exchange securities for cash and agree
to buy them back later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
