  Roche Holding AG (ROG) ’s Herceptin tumor
drug won Japanese approval as a treatment for stomach cancer.  Herceptin can be used as a therapy for gastric cancer
linked to the HER2 protein that is advanced or has returned and
can’t be treated with surgery, Basel, Switzerland-based Roche’s
Chugai unit said today in an e-mailed statement. The medicine
won European and U.S. approval for gastric cancer last year.  Herceptin, first approved in 1998 for  breast cancer , works
by neutralizing the HER-2 protein, which promotes tumor growth
and makes the disease harder to treat. Fifteen percent to 18
percent of gastric tumors are linked to high levels of the
protein, Roche has said.  About 110,000 patients were diagnosed with stomach tumors
in Japan last year, according to the Swiss company. Herceptin
was developed by Roche’s Genentech Inc. unit, also the creator
of the Avastin cancer-fighting medicine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
