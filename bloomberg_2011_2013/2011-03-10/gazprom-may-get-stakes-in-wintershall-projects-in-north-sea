OAO Gazprom and  BASF SE (BAS) ’s
Wintershall unit may swap Russian gas assets for stakes in the
German producer’s  North Sea  projects.  The companies agreed to consider jointly developing two
areas of the Achimov layers of the Urengoy gas field in western
Siberia on an equal basis, they said today in a statement.  The Russian gas exporter may also gain “equivalent”
stakes in Wintershall’s exploration and production projects in
the North Sea, according to an accord signed today in  St.
Petersburg . The companies didn’t specify the projects.  Wintershall operates 25 crude oil and gas platforms in the
Dutch North Sea and one in the German North Sea. The Kassel-based company also became  Norway ’s fifth-largest license holder
after buying Revus Energy ASA in 2008. Norway’s Energy Ministry
in January awarded the company an additional  10 production
licenses , of which it will operate six.  The companies already jointly develop the Russian Yuzhno-Russkoye  gas field  and Area 1A of the Achimov layers of the
Urengoy field. They are also partners in building the Nord
Stream pipeline to deliver gas directly from Russia to Germany
under the Baltic Sea.  To contact the reporters on this story:
