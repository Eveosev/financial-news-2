The benchmark index for U.S. stock
options rose to a two-week high after reports of violence in  Saudi Arabia  sent stocks down and lifted crude oil.  The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, rose 8.2 percent to 21.88 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York, the highest level since Feb. 23, when the gauge reached
22.13. May VIX futures gained 3.1 percent to 23.35 and June
futures advanced 3 percent to 23.80. The VIX measures the cost
of using options as insurance against declines in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index, which dropped 1.9 percent.  “The selling was more organized -- not a panic,” said  Ryan Detrick , senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s
Investment Research in Cincinnati. “We would have expected a
VIX surge of more like 15 percent.”  Equities fell, dragging the  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  to its lowest
level since January, while the dollar and Treasuries rallied as
U.S. jobless claims rose,  China ’s export growth slowed and
Spain’s credit rating was cut. Crude slipped 1.6 percent as the
police in Saudi Arabia, the Middle East’s biggest oil producer,
reportedly opened fire at a rally in the east of the country.  Trading of VIX options jumped to 1.7 times the four-week
average and 2.3 times the level for puts. May 37.50 calls were
the sixth-most active, trading almost 26,000 times.  “Investors appear to be positioning for a significant
increase in volatility,” options strategists at Susquehanna
Financial Group LLLP in wrote in a report today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
