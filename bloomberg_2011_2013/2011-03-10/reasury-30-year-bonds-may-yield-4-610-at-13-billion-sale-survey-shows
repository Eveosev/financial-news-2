The Treasury Department’s $13
billion sale of 30-year bonds may draw a yield of 4.610 percent,
according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
7 of the  Federal Reserve ’s 20 primary dealers.  The offering is a reopening of the $16 billion auction of
long bonds on Feb. 10, and the securities mature in February
2041. They yielded 4.625 percent in pre-auction trading. Bids
are due by 1 p.m. New York time.  Last month’s sale of 30-year bonds drew a yield of 4.75
percent, compared with 4.515 percent at the January auction. The
February offering’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was 2.51,
versus 2.67 at the January sale of the securities and an average
of 2.66 for the past 10 auctions.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 43.1 percent of the bonds at the
February sale and 37.8 percent at the January sale. The average
for the past 10 auctions is 38.9 percent.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 8 percent of
the securities at the last sale, compared with 12.4 percent in
January and an average of 13.4 percent at the past 10 auctions.  Thirty-year bonds have lost investors 3.4 percent this
year, trailing the 0.3 percent loss for Treasuries overall,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to participate in Treasury
auctions.  The U.S. is selling $66 billion in notes and bonds this
week. It auctioned $32 billion of three-year debt on March 8 at
a yield of 1.298 percent. It sold $21 billion of 10-year
securities yesterday at a yield of 3.499 percent, drawing the
highest bid-to-cover ratio, 3.32, since April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
