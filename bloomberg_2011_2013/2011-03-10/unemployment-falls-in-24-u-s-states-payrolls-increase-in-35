Unemployment declined in 24 U.S.
states in January and payrolls increased in 35, showing a
strengthening labor market at the start of the year.  Joblessness decreased the most in Nevada, followed by
Indiana,  Michigan  and  South Carolina , figures from the Labor
Department showed today in  Washington . The states with the
biggest gains in payrolls were Texas and Michigan.  The report is consistent with Feb. 4 figures showing U.S.
unemployment in January fell to 9 percent as employers added
63,000 workers. The improvement continued into February when the
jobless rate dropped to 8.9 percent and payrolls increased by
192,000, underscoring Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke’s
testimony to Congress that there are “grounds for  optimism”
in the labor market.  Broad-based job gains have “staying power, power for
lifting confidence and sustaining a view that will flow through
to consumer spending,” said  Jonathan Basile , an economist at
Credit Suisse in  New York .    Nevada ’s jobless rate fell to 14.2 percent from 14.9
percent the previous month, today’s figures showed. Unemployment
in Indiana dropped to 9.1 percent in January from 9.5 percent.
Joblessness fell to 10.7 percent in Michigan and 10.5 percent in
South Carolina.  Even with the decline, the jobless rate in Nevada was the
highest in the country, followed by California at 12.4 percent
and Florida at 11.9 percent, today’s report showed.  Unemployment in Colorado rose to 9.1 percent, the highest
for that state since record-keeping began in 1976.  Texas Job Leader  Texas led states with the biggest payroll gains as
employers added 44,100 workers. Michigan was second with an
increase of 39,700. Payrolls in  Ohio  rose 31,900 and employment
increased 24,500 in Illinois.  The national employment report showed payrolls rose by
63,000 in January, less than half the 152,000 gain a month
earlier. Weather may have played a role in depressing  job
creation  during the month.  Winter storms spread from the Midwest and the South to New
England, covering 71 percent of the country with snow on Jan.
12, according to the National Climatic Data Center. Last month,
the average temperature was 30 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 1.1
degrees Celsius), the coolest January since 1994 when the
temperature averaged 28 degrees Fahrenheit.  “We do see some grounds for optimism about the job market
over the next few quarters, including notable declines in the  unemployment rate  in December and January, a drop in new claims
for unemployment insurance, and an improvement in firms’ hiring
plans,” Bernanke told Congress March 1.    Federal Reserve   Central bank policy makers will likely keep  interest rates 
near zero and maintain plans to buy $600 billion in Treasury
securities by June to boost the pace of recovery until they see
signs of sustained job creation.  Employment prospects for Americans are mixed. Lowe’s Cos.,
the second-biggest U.S. home-improvement retailer, is among
companies trying to use its workforce more efficiently. The
Mooresville, North Carolina-based chain said Jan. 25 it plans to
cut 1,700 middle-management jobs and add 8,000 to 10,000 weekend
sales positions to improve staffing during its busiest hours.  At the same time, the two largest U.S. automakers are
expanding as sales pick up. Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford plans
to hire more than 7,000 workers in the next two years. Larger
rival  General Motors Co. (GM) , based in Detroit, will add a third
shift and about 750 jobs to its assembly plant in Flint,
Michigan.  State and local employment data are derived independently
from the national statistics, which are typically released on
the first Friday of every month. The state figures are subject
to larger sampling errors because they come from smaller
surveys, making the national figures more reliable, according to
the government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
