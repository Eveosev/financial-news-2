Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich and his partners in steelmaker  Evraz Group SA (EVR)  are
seeking to sell their stake in coal producer OAO  Raspadskaya (RASP) ,
said two people familiar with the matter.  Evraz and Raspadskaya’s management are each seeking to sell
40 percent of the Kemerovo, Siberia-based company and hired  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and Morgan Stanley to find a buyer, the people
said, declining to be identified because the information is
private.  Raspadskaya, once the largest supplier of coal to Russian
steelmakers, fired the head of its flagship mine last year after
90 miners died in a series of explosions that prompted Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin to rebuke the company’s safety record.  The stock declined 2.4 percent yesterday to 212.80 rubles
($7.49), valuing the company at about $5.8 billion.  Nobody at Deutsche Bank or  Morgan Stanley (MS)  who is authorized
to speak to the media could be reached immediately when
Bloomberg called their Moscow offices seeking comment. Alexander Andreev, a spokesman for Raspadskaya declined to comment, as did
an Evraz official who declined to be identified.  To contact the reporter on this story:
