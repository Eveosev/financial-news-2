European Union carbon allowances
for December fell for a second day, as British  natural gas  and
German power declined.  Futures closed down 0.7 percent at 15.77 euros ($21.78) a
metric ton on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London. They
were down earlier as much as 1.1 percent.  The U.K., Europeâ€™s second-biggest emitter, auctioned 4.4
million spot carbon-dioxide permits for 15.59 euros a metric
ton, boosting supply. The sale received total bids of 37.4
million tons, the most since March 18, 2010, when an auction
garnered bids totaling 57.6 million tons. Spot permits fell 0.3
percent to 14.95 euros on the BlueNext exchange in Paris.  Carbon permits sometimes track gas prices because utilities
burning the fuel require about half as many allowances as those
using coal. U.K. natural gas for the six months through
September declined 1.2 percent, ICE data show. German power for
next year dropped 1.3 percent to 53.10 euros a megawatt hour,
according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.  Lower power prices can reduce the incentive for utilities
to sell electricity forward, thereby curbing demand for hedging,
including purchases of carbon futures.  To contact the reporters on this story:
