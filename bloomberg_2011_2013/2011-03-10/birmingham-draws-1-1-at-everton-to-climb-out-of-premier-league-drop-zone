Birmingham City moved out of the
relegation zone in English soccer’s Premier League with a 1-1
draw at mid-table Everton.  Jean Beausejour outjumped Tony Hibbert to head past  Tim
Howard  and put Birmingham ahead at Goodison Park last night
before  John Heitinga  equalized with a shot from the edge of the
penalty area in the 35th minute.  The result lifts Birmingham into 17th place with 31 points,
above West Ham on goal difference. The Blues, who won the League
Cup last month, have played one game fewer than West Ham,
Wolverhampton and Wigan -- the three teams occupying the
relegation positions.  Everton, which moves up one place to ninth with 37 points,
had chances to take the lead in the second half. Birmingham
midfielder Jordon Mutch denied Louis Saha with a diving block,
while Jermaine Beckford’s close-range shot forced goalkeeper  Ben Foster  into a save.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
