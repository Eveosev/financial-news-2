Portuguese Foreign Affairs Minister
Luis Amado said he told an envoy of the Libyan government
yesterday that, from the point of view of the international
community, the regime of Muammar Qaddafi has ended, Lusa
reported, citing Amado.  It is “fundamental” that those in Tripoli understand that
it’s necessary to create conditions for a cease-fire and to
start a national dialogue, Amado said in Brussels today,
according to the Portuguese news agency. Amado said he also
spoke to the Libyan opposition, Lusa reported.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
