  New World Resources NV (NWR) , the biggest
Czech supplier of coal to steelmakers, declined for a fifth day,
headed for its lowest close this year.  The stock lost 2.2 percent to 264 koruna by 11:48 a.m. in
Prague. A close at that level would be its weakest since Dec. 21
and mark its longest stretch of declines since September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
