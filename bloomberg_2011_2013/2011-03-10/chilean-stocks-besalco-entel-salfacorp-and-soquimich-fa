Chinese copper imports fell in February to their lowest level in
more than two years.    Embotelladora Andina SA (AKO/A)   fell 2.4 percent to
2,115 pesos, the most since Feb. 9. Chile’s largest Coca-Cola

list of favorite Chilean stocks.  Soc. Quimica y Minera de  Chile  SA (SQM/B CC), Chile’s
largest fertilizer producer, lost 3 percent to 25,384 pesos.
Agricultural commodity prices fell today, which signals lower
demand for Soquimich’s fertilizers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
