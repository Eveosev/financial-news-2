  Malaysia ’s ringgit weakened after a
government report today showed factory production cooled as  oil
prices  stoked concern about slowing economic growth.  The currency fell for a third day in four as economists
forecast in a Bloomberg poll that Bank Negara Malaysia will keep   interest rates  on hold tomorrow as surging oil prices raise 
concern growth will slow. Prime Minister Najib Razak said 
yesterday higher fuel costs will impact the local economy and 
push up state subsidies.  “Higher commodity prices will be a contractionary force
that could weaken the global economic recovery,” said Yeah Kim Leng, Kuala Lumpur-based chief economist at RAM Holdings Bhd.,
Malaysia’s biggest ratings company. “It could moderate the
ringgit’s appreciation.”  The ringgit fell 0.2 percent to 3.0370 per dollar as of
4:09 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It has slipped 0.4 percent from 3.0240 on Feb. 21,
the strongest level since October 1997.  Industrial production gained 1 percent in January from a
year earlier, easing from a revised 4.5 percent pace in
December, the government said today. Economists expected 1.2
percent gain in a Bloomberg News survey.  The ringgit extended losses after  China  said its exports
rose 2.4 percent in February from a year earlier, the smallest
gain since 2009, damping outlook for growth and yuan
appreciation.  Crude rose 0.3 percent to $104.71 a barrel, capping a 15
percent jump this year. Rising crude prices “will not only have
an impact on the global economy but also Malaysia, inflation and
sovereign debt,” Najib said in Kuala Lumpur. Annual subsidies
will increase by 4 billion ringgit ($1.3 billion) if retail fuel
prices aren’t raised to match oil gains, he said.  Rate Outlook  Three-year yields held near a one-week low.  Bank Negara
Malaysia  will keep its overnight rate at 2.75 percent tomorrow,
according to 16 out of 20 economists in a Bloomberg News poll.
Four predicted an increase to 3 percent. Policy makers haven’t
changed the rate since July.  The yield on the 3.434 percent note due August 2014 was
little-changed at 3.39 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia. The
price increased 0.01, or 10 sen per 1,000 ringgit face amount,
to 100.15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
