  Manhattan  U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara objected to the sale of  Blockbuster Inc. (BLOAQ)  to creditors,
saying the transaction documents improperly imply that the
buyers would be released from police and environmental
liabilities for contaminated property.  The agreement to sell the bankrupt video retailer to a
group of creditors would exclude all environmental liabilities
and obligations, and all other liabilities relating to health
and safety matters, Bharara said in a filing in  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court  in Manhattan yesterday. The sale wouldn’t be free and
clear of liens and claims, he said.  “Transactions involving environmentally contaminated
property, however, may not be construed as releasing or
otherwise relieving an entity of any police or regulatory
liability to a governmental unit as the owner or operator of
property” after a court-approved sale, he said in the filing.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  Burton Lifland  is due to hold a
hearing today on whether Dallas-based Blockbuster should be sold
or liquidated.  Blockbuster began reorganizing in September with 5,600
stores, including 3,300 in the U.S. The petition listed assets
of $1.02 billion against debt of $1.47 billion.  The case is In re Blockbuster, 10-14997, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
