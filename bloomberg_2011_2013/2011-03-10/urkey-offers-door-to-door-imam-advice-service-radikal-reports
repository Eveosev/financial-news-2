  Turkey  began a program in which
state-supported Islamic religious leaders will go door-to-door
to speak with Turks about religion and encourage them to drop
habits such as drinking, smoking and using drugs,  Radikal  said.  Turkey’s Religious Affairs Directorate kicked off the
“Family Imam” project in the eastern Mediterranean city of
Adana, the newspaper said.  Imams shouldn’t be limited to leading prayers at mosques
and have a responsibility to talk with citizens about religion
and help them overcome their “bad habits,” Radikal cited
Ismail Canbolat, chief imam of Adana province, as saying.  The imams will “leave no door unknocked” as they carry
out the project, local religious officials told Radikal.  To contact the report on this story:  Benjamin Harvey  in Ankara at
