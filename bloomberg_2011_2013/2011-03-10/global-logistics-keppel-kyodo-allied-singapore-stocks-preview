Index, which tracks prices of 19 commodities from copper to
corn, fell 1.6 percent in  New York  yesterday, extending its
decline for a third day.    Noble Group Ltd. (NOBL)  , a Hong Kong-based
commodities supplier, dropped 1.9 percent to S$2.02.  Olam
International Ltd. (OLAM)  , a Singapore-based supplier of
agricultural commodities, sank 2.6 percent to S$2.63.  Real estate companies in Japan: Shares of Singapore
companies with real estate holdings in Japan declined after a
magnitude 8.9 earthquake struck off the country’s northeast,
sending waves crashing through coastal towns and shaking
buildings in Tokyo.    Global Logistic Properties Ltd. (GLP)  , the logistics
company that counts Japan as its biggest market, declined 3.1
percent to S$1.90.  Mapletree Logistics Trust (MLT)  , which
gets about 19 percent of sales from Japan, dropped 2.7
percent to 91 Singapore cents. Saizen Real Estate Investment
Trust (SZREIT), which owns residential apartments in Japan,
slumped 6.1 percent to 15.5 Singapore cents.    CapitaMall Trust (CT)  , Singapore’s biggest retail
property trust, slipped 1.1 percent to S$1.81 after the
company increased the size of its convertible bond sale to
S$250 million ($196 million) from S$200 million because of
strong demand. The fund-raising exercise was “a rather
unnecessary move” as CapitaMall trust had about S$713
million cash as of Dec. 31 and a gearing of about 38 percent,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts Joy Wang and Christopher Gee
wrote in a note to clients today.  SMRT Corp. (MRT SP): Singapore’s biggest commuter train
operator slipped 1 percent to S$1.91. Global Logistic will
replace SMRT on the benchmark Singapore index effective March
21, according to a statement by the  Singapore  Exchange Ltd.

International Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
