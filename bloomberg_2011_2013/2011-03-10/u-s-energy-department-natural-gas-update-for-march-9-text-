Following is the text of the weekly natural gas
update as released by the U.S. Department of Energy in Washington D.C.:  Natural gas spot prices remained soft at nearly all domestic pricing points. The
Henry Hub price rose an insignificant 2 cents per million Btu (MMBtu) (0.5
percent) for the week ending March 9, to $3.81 per MMBtu.  Working natural gas in storage fell to 1,674 billion cubic feet (Bcf) as of
Friday, March 4, according to the Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) Weekly
Natural Gas Storage Report (WNGSR). The implied draw for the week was 71 Bcf, with
storage volumes positioned 32 Bcf above year-ago levels.  At the  New York Mercantile Exchange  (NYMEX), the April 2011 natural gas contract
price rose 11.2 cents to $3.900 per MMBtu from the previous Wednesday.  The natural gas rotary rig count, as reported March 4 by Baker Hughes
Incorporated, fell by 7 to 899 active units. This activity level stands 27 units
less than the same period last year.  Prices  Prevailing natural  gas prices  continued their decline during the week except for a
brief reversal around Monday and Tuesday when a brief cold snap passed. The New
York citygate was reflective of pricing points showing a loss over the week,
although at the extreme end, falling from an elevated level of $7.96 per MMBtu
last Wednesday to $4.44 per MMBtu yesterday. However, during the week, the New
York citygate price jumped $0.26 per MMBtu over Monday and Tuesday when a cold
snap passed, hitting a peak of $4.67 per MMBtu before giving back $0.23 of the
gain yesterday. The Chicago citygate was also representative of the general weekly
trend and dropped from $4.00 per MMBtu the previous Wednesday to $3.96 per MMBtu
yesterday, leaving the price $0.69 per MMBtu less than last year.  Spot Prices  However, at the NYMEX, the price of the April 2011 contract increased 11.2 cents
(2.9 percent) over the week from $3.818 per MMBtu to $3.930 per MMBtu. The NYMEX
price has risen in 3 of the past 4 days.  Over the week, the Henry Hub price followed the direction of the NYMEX (but much
more muted) rising 0.5 percent from $3.79 per MMBtu to $3.81 per MMBtu. The Henry
Hub price is now down 70 cents (nearly 16 percent) from last year.  An overall falloff in natural gas consumption, likely due to moderating
temperatures during the week, was a prime catalyst causing the recent general
price softness to continue. According to estimates from BENTEK Energy Services,
LLC, domestic consumption this week decreased by 4.9 percent from the previous
week. A decrease in the residential/commercial sector of 7.1 percent led the
decline, followed by a reduction of 2.7 percent in the industrial sector, and a
drop of 1.6 percent in the power sector.  According to BENTEK estimates, the week’s average of 66.9 Bcf per day of total
nominal gas supply represented an increase of 0.1 percent from last week’s value.
Domestic gas production was up 0.6 percent, accounting for the bulk of the
increase. BENTEK notes that Monday, March 7 set a new production record at 63.4
Bcf per day. Canadian imports (about 5.8 Bcf per day) were down 7.5 percent for
the week and remain 9.1 percent below year-ago levels. Things were little changed
in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) arena, where imports (almost 1 Bcf per day)
surged 29.9 percent above last week but remain 25.7 percent below the
corresponding week last year.  Storage  Working natural gas in storage fell to 1,674 Bcf as of Friday, March 4, according
to EIA’s WNGSR. The 71 Bcf draw was less than the 5-year average draw for the week
of 107 Bcf and last year’s draw of 112 Bcf. Stocks were 32 Bcf above last year’s
level and 21 Bcf above the 5-year average of 1,760 Bcf.  Stocks in the Producing Region have increased for the second week in a row.
Relatively mild weather in that part of the country along with increasing
production has lead to this anomaly. Injections are typically not seen until later
in March for the region.  Temperatures in the lower 48 States during the week ending March 3 were almost
equal to normal and slightly warmer than last year. The  National Weather Service ’s
degree-day data show that the temperature in the lower 48 States last week
averaged 40.0 degrees, though different regions saw major differences. The Western
and Midwestern regions were colder than typical, with the West North Central
census division 6.9 degrees colder than normal. This was balanced by the East and
South, which experienced relatively warm weather. Overall, heating degree-days
were about 2 percent above normal but 9 percent below last year.  Other Market Trends  Short-Term Energy Outlook Forecasts Strength in Production. On March 8, EIA
released the “Short-Term Energy Outlook”, which includes projections through 2012.
Production in 2010 grew 4.4 percent to 61.8 Bcf per day. EIA forecasts production
to continue to grow, but at slower annual rates of 0.8 percent in 2011 and 0.9
percent in 2012. EIA expects that the Henry Hub spot price will average $4.10 per
MMBtu in 2011, a drop of $0.29 per MMBtu from the 2010 average. EIA expects the
natural gas market to begin to tighten in 2012, with the Henry Hub spot price
increasing to an average of $4.58 per MMBtu. Increasing consumption in 2012, led
by strong growth in the electric power sector, contributes to higher 2012 prices
and to an economic incentive for producers to resume drilling. At the end of the
2010-2011 winter heating season, EIA expects that about 1,549 Bcf of working
natural gas will remain in storage.  Natural Gas Rigs Drop to Lowest Level in More Than a Year. According to data
released by Baker Hughes Incorporated on March 4, 2011, natural gas-directed
rotary rigs fell to 899, their lowest level since February 19, 2010. For several
weeks prior to March 4, the rig count had hovered between 900 and 915. Horizontal
rigs (including both oil and natural gas) also fell this week by 11 to 970.
Directional and vertical rigs, on the other hand, both rose this week. Despite the
decline this week, horizontal rigs remain at historically high levels, likely
because of the implementation of more efficient horizontal drilling techniques in
shale plays.  Natural Gas Transportation Update  Transcontinental Gas Pipeline Corporation, LLC (Transco) this week reminded
customers that high utilization of firm services near Moore,  South Carolina , is
limiting the availability of interruptible transportation services near this
location (downstream of Compressor Station 140). However, the pipeline company
said that there would soon be relief from the current congestion. On May 1,
Transco will bring a major expansion of capacity in the area into service. One of
the facilities associated with this project is its new Compressor Station 135, to
be near Anderson, South Carolina.  Destin Pipeline Company, LLC on Friday, March 4, again began transporting supplies
from platforms in the offshore  Gulf of Mexico  after receiving assurance from a
downstream pipeline that it was operational. The downstream pipeline was Tri-
States Pipeline, which had shut down temporarily following unauthorized vehicle
activity within the pipeline’s right-of-way near Kiln,  Mississippi . Because Tri-
States Pipeline provides transportation service for the natural gas liquids
carried by Destin from the offshore platforms, Destin was unable to provide
service while the pipeline was offline and performing various inspections on the
activity.  Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC on March 7 revealed plans that all 22 meters behind
the Walgrove Compressor Station in Kanawha County,  West Virginia , will be shut in
for an estimated 19 days as the compressor station undergoes annual maintenance.
The pipeline company estimated the impacted volume at 5 million cubic feet (MMcf)
per day. Firm production quantities will be limited to minimal local market
consumption.  Gulf South Pipeline Company, LP on Tuesday said planned maintenance will occur on
a part of its pipeline for about 5 days starting March 14. The maintenance will be
on its 12-inch diameter Fort Bend Line in  Texas , during which its receipt point in
Fort Bend, Texas, will not be available for service. The receipt point is operated
by Atmos Pipeline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
