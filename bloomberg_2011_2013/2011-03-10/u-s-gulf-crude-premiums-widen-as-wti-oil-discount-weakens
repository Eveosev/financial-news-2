U.S. Gulf crude premiums widened as
the benchmark West  Texas  Intermediate’s discount to its European
counterpart strengthened for the second consecutive day.  The gap between April-delivery WTI futures and Brent, the
basis for European and West African crudes, widened $1.01 to
$12.57 at 12:41 p.m. in  New York . The differential reached a
record $15.94 on Feb. 16.  When Brent gains versus WTI, it strengthens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against Brent.  Among Gulf Coast sour, or high-sulfur, grades, Mars Blend’s
premium to WTI widened $1.25 to $7.75 a barrel, while Poseidon
strengthened $1.50 to $7.50 over the benchmark, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg at 12:09 p.m. in New York.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium gained $2 to $7 a barrel.
Thunder Horse strengthened $2.40 to $11 a barrel over WTI.  West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 5 cents to $3.60 a
barrel. WTS is delivered in Midland, Texas, so its price is less
influenced by imports.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI strengthened $2.85
to $14.50 a barrel. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium narrowed 75
cents to $14.75.  Syncrude’s premium was unchanged at $11.75 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands  in  Alberta . The discount for Western Canada Select was
unchanged at $20.50 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
