  Molycorp Inc. (MCP) , owner of the largest
rare-earth deposit outside  China , said Chinese leaders have said
the country may become a net importer of the minerals by 2015 as
internal demand grows and it seeks to consolidate its industry.  “Senior government leaders in China consistently stress
China’s intent to continue to restrict rare earth exports, and
the possibility of China becoming a net rare earth importing
nation by 2015,” the  Greenwood Village , Colorado-based company
said today in a statement announcing fourth-quarter earnings.
“China’s internal consumption of rare earths will continue to
increase as its gross domestic product increases.”  China controls  95 percent  of global supply, according to
the  U.S. Geological Survey . Rare earths -- 17 chemically similar
metals used in products including batteries, electric cars and
wind turbines -- have soared in price since July, when China
said it would cut exports by 72 percent. Molycorp restarted
operations in December at its mine near Mountain Pass,  California , that had been shut since 2002.  The company’s fourth-quarter net loss narrowed to $7.9
million, or 10 cents a share, from $9.1 million, or 22 cents, a
year earlier, Molycorp said in the statement. Sales climbed
almost 10-fold to $21.7 million from $2.2 million.  Molycorp advanced $1.28, or 2.6 percent, to $49.90 at 7:20
p.m. after the close of regular New York Stock Exchange trading.
The shares have more than tripled since its July 29 initial
public offering.  Old Stockpiles  Molycorp now is generating revenue by selling rare earths
from stockpiles left from previous mining. It plans to begin new
production in the second half of 2012 and boost mining capacity
to 40,000 metric tons annually in 2013.  The company said supply will be further restricted as
countries including China,  South Korea  and Japan are increasing
their stockpiles of rare earths.  For China “to go from a substantial exporter to an
importer would have a dramatic impact on the price,” said
Anthony Young, an analyst with Dahlman Rose & Co. in New York.  “Commencing production in 2012 and increasing in 2013 --
leading to substantial profitability for these guys -- should be
more than enough to get investors interested in the name," Young
said today in a telephone interview.  Molycorp said it won’t comment on acquisition speculation,
adding that while it’s always seeking opportunities to add value
for shareholders, there are few good rare-earth resources
available.  To contact the reporter on this story:
