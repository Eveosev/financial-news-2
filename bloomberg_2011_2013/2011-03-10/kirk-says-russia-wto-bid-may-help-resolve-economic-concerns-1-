U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk
said that getting Russia into the  World Trade Organization  would
help deal with longstanding issues about the openness of that
nation’s economy.  “It is in our interest to bring the world’s largest
economy” that’s not subject to WTO rules into the global trade
group, Kirk said today during a luncheon sponsored by the
Christian Science Monitor. “This is one tool that we will have
available to us that we would otherwise have not.”  Vice President  Joseph Biden , in Moscow this week, said the
administration of President Barack Obama “strongly supports”
Russia’s bid to join the WTO, pending for 17 years.  In order for U.S. companies to get the tariff cuts Russia
will endorse as a WTO member, the Congress must repeal a Cold
War-era law inhibiting full  market access  in Russia.  Senator Benjamin Cardin, a Maryland Democrat, said
yesterday he is skeptical of voting to clear Russia for the
Geneva-based WTO, citing what he called the unsatisfactory
experience after  China  was permitted into the body a decade ago.  “I’m just not going to knee-jerk approve these agreements
unless I know that we have effective remedies,” Cardin told
Kirk yesterday. “You only have certain leverage points. Once
they are in the WTO, our chances of getting enforceable
provisions in an understanding with the  United States 
evaporates.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
