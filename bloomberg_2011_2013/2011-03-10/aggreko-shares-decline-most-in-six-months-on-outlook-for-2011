  Aggreko Plc (AGK) , fell the most in six
months after saying trading profit may be little changed in 2011
while instability in the Middle East and  Africa  makes predicting
the outcome for the year “more than normally difficult.”  The world’s largest provider of mobile power supplies
declined as much as 99 pence, or 6.7 percent, to 1,390 pence in
London, the biggest intraday drop since Aug. 25. The stock
traded at 1,409 pence as of 10:06 a.m., valuing the Glasgow,
Scotland-based company at 3.87 billion pounds ($6.26 billion).  Aggreko said trading profit in 2011 will be similar to
2010. Allowing for currency movements and as business from
sporting events such as 2010’s soccer  World Cup  isn’t repeated,
that would represent underlying growth of about 15 percent, the
company said today in a statement.  “Our exposure where there are issues is pretty small and
limited,” Chief Executive Officer Rupert Soames said on a
conference call today. “We have no exposure in Libya or  Tunisia .”  Aggreko operates in Yemen and  Ivory Coast , Soames said,
where the company leases equipment capable of generating about
140 megawatts of power. That compares with the company’s total
generation capability of about 6,700 megawatts.  Net income for the year rose to 213.1 million pounds from
168.4 million pounds a year earlier.  The company made 87 million pounds of revenue in 2010 from
the Vancouver winter Olympics, the soccer World Cup and Asian
Games.  “We have tried to persuade FIFA to run the World Cup every
year, sadly they have not listened,” Soames said. The company
will make more revenue from sporting events at the summer
Olympics in  London  in 2012, he said. “Every even year, you get
a big year for events and every odd year, you’re basically down
to the tiddlywinks championships.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
