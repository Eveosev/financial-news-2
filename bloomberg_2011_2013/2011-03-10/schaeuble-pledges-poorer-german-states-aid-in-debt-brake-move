Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble 
agreed to help  Germany ’s poorer states reach constitutional
“debt-brake” targets for balancing their budgets by 2020.  Saxony-Anhalt today became the first of five states to get
access to a total aid pot of 800 million euros ($1.1 billion),
the  Finance Ministry  said. Berlin, Schleswig-Holstein, Bremen
and Saarland, all with economic growth rates below the national
average, will follow in a bid to balance the federal budget in
2015 and those of the 16 states five years later.  “The road we’re taking with the targets is ambitious,”
Deputy Finance Minister Werner Gatzer told reporters in Berlin.
“There’s absolutely no alternative, though, to sticking to the
terms of the debt brake for the federal government and states.”  Copying a Swiss blueprint, Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
government anchored a timetable for balancing the budget in the
constitution in 2009 as spending surged to temper the impact of
the banking crisis. Support for the measure in Germany’s poorer
states, previously lukewarm, has increased as the euro debt
crisis unfolded.  Some of Germany’s states may struggle to keep to the debt-
brake targets, the  IW-Cologne economic institute  said today in a
report, citing cumulative debt of 600 billion euros this year, a
66 percent increase since 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
