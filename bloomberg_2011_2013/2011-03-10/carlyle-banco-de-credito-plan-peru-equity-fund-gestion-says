  Carlyle Group  and Banco de Credito
del  Peru  plan to create Peru’s biggest private equity fund,
 Gestion  reported, citing Javier Maggiolo, head of the bank’s

million initially and will invest in medium-sized businesses
seeking to take advantage of growing domestic demand, Maggiolo
said, according to the Lima-based newspaper.  A Bloomberg News phone call to Maggiolo seeking comment
wasn’t immediately returned. Christopher Ullman, director of
global communications for Carlyle, said he didn’t have an
immediate comment.
