The Sudanese army clashed with
rebels in the western region of Darfur in fighting that killed
15 insurgents and two government soldiers, army spokesman Al-
Sawarmi Khaled said.  Army units attacked the  Sudan  Liberation Army faction led
by Abdel Wahid Nour in the Jebel Marra region on March 8 after
the group attempted to ambush the army, Khaled said today by
phone from Khartoum, Sudan’s capital.  “The army is clearing the area of these rebels,” Khaled
said. “We will continue chasing these people away and secure
the area.”  Fighting in Darfur erupted in 2003 when insurgents took up
arms, accusing the government of neglecting the region. The
conflict has led to the deaths of as many as 300,000 people,
mainly due to illness and starvation, and forced about 2.7
million to flee their homes, according to  United Nations 
estimates. The Sudanese government has put the death toll at
about 10,000.  Sudanese President Umar al-Bashir is wanted by the
 International Criminal Court  on charges of responsibility for
genocide and war crimes in Darfur. He denies the charges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
