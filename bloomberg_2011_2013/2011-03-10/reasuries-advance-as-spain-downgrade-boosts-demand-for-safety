Treasuries rose after a government
report showed U.S. first-time claims for  unemployment benefits 
increased last week more than economists forecast, fueling
concern improvement in the labor market will be uneven.  Benchmark 10-year note yields touched a one-week low as
Moody’s Investors Service cut Spain’s credit rating. Thirty-year
bond yields dropped before today’s $13 billion auction of the
securities. Yesterday’s $21 billion sale of 10-year notes drew
the highest level of demand since April.  “The claims number is a little elevated over
expectations,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist
and economist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia.
“It’s within the range of the weekly volatility, so it doesn’t
fall too much outside of expectations. We continue to see
improvement in the labor market, although the pace is not as
fast as the bond bears had hoped.”  The benchmark 10-year note yield dropped three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.44 percent at 9:31 a.m.
in  New York , according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the
3.625 percent security maturing in February 2021 increased 9/32,
or $2.81 per $1,000 face amount, to 101 18/32.  The yield earlier slid to 3.42 percent, the lowest level
since March 2. The 30-year bond yield dropped two basis points
to 4.59 percent before the auction.  Jobless Claims  Initial applications for  unemployment insurance  increased
to 397,000 in the week ended March 5 from 371,000 in the
previous week, the Labor Department reported. The median
forecast of 49 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for an
advance to 376,000 from a previously reported 368,000.  Spain’s government bond ratings were cut one level to Aa2
from Aa1, and the outlook is negative, Moody’s said. The cost of
shoring up  Spain ’s banking industry will be 40 billion to 50
billion euros ($69 billion), more than the government expects,
according to Moody’s.  The “eventual cost of bank restructuring will exceed the
government’s current assumptions” of 20 billion euros, while
the risks to government finances remain “skewed to the
downside,” the company said in a statement today.  “There has been quite a big reaction to Spain,” said  Peter Chatwell , an interest-rate strategist at Credit Agricole
SA in  London . “The market was already jittery, and it’s really
pounced on that. There has not been much liquidity in the market
either, hence the Treasuries move being perhaps slightly
exaggerated.”  Drop in Stocks  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index decreased 0.3 percent. The
Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell as much as 1 percent to the lowest
level since Jan. 31.    Brent crude  for April settlement rose as much as 0.5
percent to $116.55 a barrel in London before falling 1 percent.
The price has risen 21 percent this year.  Muammar Qaddafi’s forces resumed air strikes on oil hubs in
the central area of  Libya ’s coastline that mark the east-west
dividing line in the nation’s civil war, as the U.S. and its
allies discuss how to intervene.  Treasuries rose earlier after a Chinese report showed
exports grew at the slowest rate in 15 months, encouraging
speculation that the global recovery is slowing.    China ’s exports increased 2.4 percent in February from a
year earlier, the lowest pace since November 2009, the customs
bureau reported today.  U.S. Bond Sale  The 30-year bonds being sold today yielded 4.625 percent in
pre-auction trading, compared with 4.750 percent at the previous
auction of the securities Feb. 10.  Investors bid for 2.51 times the amount of debt offered
last month, versus an average of 2.66 for the past 10 sales.
Indirect bidders, the investor group that includes foreign
central banks, bought 43.1 percent of the securities, more than
the 10-auction average of 38.9 percent.  Treasuries gained yesterday as the 10-year note auction
drew a yield of 3.499 percent, less than the average forecast of
3.535 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of eight primary
dealers. Bids amounted to 3.32 times the amount of available
debt, the highest level since April.    U.S. government debt  has handed investors a 0.3 percent
loss this year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
indexes. The drop follows a 2.7 percent slide in the fourth
quarter. The  MSCI World (MXWO)  Index of stocks has returned 4 percent.  The Fed said in November it would buy $600 billion of  government securities  through June to pump money into the
economy. The central bank bought $6.7 billion of debt yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
