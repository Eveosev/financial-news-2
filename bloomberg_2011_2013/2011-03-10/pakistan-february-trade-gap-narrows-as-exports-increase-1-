  Pakistan â€™s trade deficit narrowed
9.23 percent in February as exports rose faster than imports.  The  trade gap  narrowed to $895 million in the eighth month
of the financial year, Arif Cheema, director general of the
Federal Bureau of Statistics said at a news conference in
Islamabad today.  Overseas sales rose 42 percent to $2.16 billion, while
imports rose 22 percent to $3.1 billion, Cheema said.  Export growth was faster than the 38.2 percent growth in
January, and import growth was faster than the 3.7 percent
increase the previous month.  Pakistan is seeking to boost exports to sustain growth in a
country where the  World Bank  estimates a quarter of the
population lives on less than a dollar a day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
