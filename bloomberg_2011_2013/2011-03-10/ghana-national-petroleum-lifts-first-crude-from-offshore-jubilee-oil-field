The  Ghana  National Petroleum Corp.,
the West African nation’s state-owned oil company, lifted its
first crude from the offshore Jubilee field yesterday, said
Chief Executive Officer Nana Boakye Asafu-Adjaye.  The company lifted 995,259 barrels, which is bound for  Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  refineries in the U.S., he told reporters in Accra,
the capital, today. Ghana will earn about $110 million from the
sale, which will be paid into GNPC’s account on April 8, Asafu-
Adjaye said.  The West African nation, which is  Africa ’s second-biggest
cocoa and gold producer, became a crude exporter last year.
Since testing of the Jubilee well began in November, 3.6 million
barrels of oil have been produced, which was lifted by other
companies that have stakes in the field, according to a GNPC
presentation. Production officially began on Dec. 15. According
to the  International Monetary Fund , petroleum could outpace gold
as Ghana’s top export  earner  this year.  Ghana hopes its oil will attract a higher price than
Nigeria’s Bonny Light, said Ato Ahwoi, chairman of GNPC’s board,
said.  GNPC holds a 13.75 percent interest in Jubilee. U.K.-based
explorer  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , which owns a 34.7 percent stake in the
field, is scheduled to lift 950,000 barrels from Jubilee between
March 18 and March 19 and again between April 21 and April 22,
according to Asafu-Adjaye. Kosmos Energy Ltd., which owns 23.49
percent of the field, is scheduled to lift an additional 950,000
barrels on April 21-22.  Other partners include Anadarko Corp., which controls 23.5
percent; Sabre Oil and Gas Holdings Ltd., which holds 2.8
percent and Ghana’s EO Group, which has 1.75 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
