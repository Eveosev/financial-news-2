  Turkey  and  Greece  have resolved an
80-year-old dispute, allowing both countries to expand their
embassies in Athens and Ankara, Sabah newspaper reported.  Turkey has agreed to buy the four-story building opposite
its Athens embassy, complete with a library, Sabah said, citing
Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu. Turkey had previously wanted
to purchase the next-door property, it said.  Authorities in Ankara will now work for a rapid
construction permit for Greece to build on the empty lot it owns
in the Kavaklidere region of Ankara, the newspaper said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
