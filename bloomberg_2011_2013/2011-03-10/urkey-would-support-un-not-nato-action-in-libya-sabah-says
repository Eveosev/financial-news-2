  Turkey  softened its opposition to
Western action in Libya, saying it would back a no-fly zone
imposed by the  United Nations  rather than the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization,  Sabah  newspaper reported.  Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan re-evaluated his
position against Western intervention after news of Libyan
leader Muammar Qaddafiâ€™s continued air bombardment of the
opposition, Sabah said, citing unidentified diplomats.  Turkey is opposed to any NATO-led mission in Libya that
could divide the Eastern and Western worlds, Sabah said. Turkey
would support a decision taken by the UN to protect civilians
that was backed and supported by other Muslim nations, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
