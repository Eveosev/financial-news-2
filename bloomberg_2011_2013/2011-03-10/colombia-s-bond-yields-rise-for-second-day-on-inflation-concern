  Colombia ’s peso bonds dropped,
pushing yields higher for a second day, on speculation inflation
quickened this month amid higher-than-average rain and after the
government raised local gasoline prices.  The yield on the Colombian government’s benchmark 11
percent bonds due July 2020 rose 3 basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 8.22 percent at 1:39 p.m. New York time,
according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The bond’s price fell
0.182 centavo to 117.587 centavos per peso.  “There’s a lot of uncertainty regarding March inflation
and under those circumstances investors don’t want to take big
positions” in peso bonds, known as TES, said Gustavo Sorzano,
an analyst at Bogota-based Helm Bank SA.  Colombia raised the price of gasoline in March following
the “significant” jump in oil in international markets, the
Mines and Energy Ministry said in a Feb. 28 statement.  The South American nation will have above-average rainfall
through early June because of the La Nina weather pattern,
state-run Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental
Studies said earlier this week. Floods in the fourth quarter
left at least 300 dead in Colombia, damaged crops and choked off
farmers’ supply routes, pushing annual inflation in January to
3.4 percent, its highest level since June 2009.  Annual inflation unexpectedly slowed in February to 3.17
percent, below the 3.6 percent median forecast in a Bloomberg
survey. The central bank targets inflation between 2 percent and
4 percent this year.  The peso climbed for a third day, strengthening 0.5 percent
to 1,867.50 per  U.S. dollar , from 1,876.75 yesterday. That’s its
strongest level on a closing basis since Feb. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
