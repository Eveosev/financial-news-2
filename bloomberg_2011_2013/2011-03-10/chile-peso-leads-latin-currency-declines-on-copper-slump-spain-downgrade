  Chile ’s peso fell to the weakest
level against the  U.S. dollar  in six weeks as prices of the
country’s commodity exports slid and investors shed riskier
assets on concern a nuclear disaster is unfolding in Japan.  The peso slid 0.5 percent to 483.55 per dollar, the weakest
since Jan. 28, from 481.13 at yesterday’s close. Interest-rate
swap and central bank bond yields fell.  Copper, Chile’s main export, fell to a three-month low as
equities and commodities plunged after Tokyo Electric Power
Co.’s nuclear power plant was rocked by two explosions. Workers
struggled to avert a meltdown that may lead to more radiation
leaks in the wake of Japan’s March 11 earthquake.  “Stock markets are falling because of the situation in  Japan  and that is also hitting commodities such as copper,”
said Eugenio Cortes, head of currency forwards trading at
Euroamerica Corredores de Bolsa SA.  Copper for delivery in May fell as much as 2.6 percent to
$4.076 a pound in  New York , the lowest level since Dec. 16. The  S&P 500 index  lost as much as 2.7 percent while oil traded below
$100 a barrel for a third day in New York.  Chile’s central bank bought $50 million today at an average
of 484.9 pesos per U.S. dollar, according to its website, as
part of a $12 billion plan to weaken the peso.  Chile’s one-year interest rate swaps in pesos fell 9 basis
points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 4.96 percent.  The yield on a basket of 10-year central bank bonds in
pesos lost eight basis points, the most in a month, to 6.58
percent. A similar basket of inflation-linked bonds fell 6 basis
points to 2.94 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
