Securities and Exchange Commission
Chairman  Mary Schapiro  said a consultant’s finding that the
agency doesn’t have the resources to cope with a workload
expanded by the Dodd-Frank Act confirms the case that she and
her top aides have been presenting to  Washington  policy makers.  The Boston Consulting Group’s 263-page report, delivered to
Congress today, “confirms the concerns I have been expressing
that the SEC does not have the resources to perform all the
activities expected of us,” Schapiro said in a statement. “As
the report notes, despite the growth of our responsibilities and
market complexities, the SEC’s resources have not kept pace.”  The independent review of the SEC’s operations, mandated by
the financial-regulation law enacted last year, concluded that
lawmakers should either “relax funding constraints to allow the
SEC to better fulfill its current role” or “change the SEC’s
role to fit available funding.”  The report also recommends that the SEC reshape itself “to
maximize efficiency, effectiveness and collaboration,” urging a
reconsideration of “its divisional structure, operations
management and regional model.”  In response, Schapiro assigned SEC Chief Operating Officer
Jeffrey Heslop to lead a series of working groups being created
to address the consultant’s recommendations and report to
Congress and the public on the agency’s progress.  Bloomberg News reported on the  Boston Consulting Group ’s
findings on March 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
