Britain’s armed forces, police and
firefighters would have to work to the age of 60 and lose their
final-salary pension arrangements under plans for the reform of
public-sector pensions, the London-based Times reported.  The plans, which the newspaper has reviewed, will be
presented today by John Hutton, a former Labour minister who has
conducted a review for Prime Minister  David Cameron .  The main proposal is to abandon final-salary pensions in
favour of pensions linked to average earnings during entire
careers; the highest paid public employees, including doctors,
senior military officers, head teachers and top civil servants,
could lose tens of thousands of pounds a year, the Times said.  At present, members of the armed forces must retire at 55
and can draw full pensions after 22 years’ service, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
