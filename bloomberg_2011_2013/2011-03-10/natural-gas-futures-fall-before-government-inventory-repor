Natural gas futures declined in  New
York  after an Energy Department report today showed that U.S.
stockpiles dropped less than expected.  Gas fell the most since March 1 as supplies slipped 71
billion cubic feet in the week ended March 4 to 1.674 trillion
cubic feet. Analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg showed an
expected drop of 78 billion. The inventory total was above five-
year average levels for the first time since January.  “It was a very bearish number,” said  Cameron Horwitz , an
analyst in Houston at Canaccord Genuity. “It painted a little
bit more of a bearish picture looking forward, and this market
really has no reason at this point to move above $4.”  Natural gas for April delivery fell 10 cents, or 2.5
percent, to settle at $3.83 per million British thermal units on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Gas traded at $3.867 before
the storage report was released at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington . The
futures have declined 13 percent this year.  The inventory decline was smaller than the five-year
average drop for the week of 107 billion cubic feet, department
data showed. Stockpiles were 1.3 percent above the average,
comparing with a deficit of 0.9 percent in the previous seven-
day period. The last time stockpiles exceeded the five-year
average was the week ended Jan. 28.  Temperatures will be above normal from March 15 to March 19
across much of the country, according to the  National Weather
Service .  The high in New York on March 17 will be 59 degrees
Fahrenheit (8 Celsius), 15 degrees above normal, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania . The high in  Chicago  may be 50, 2 degrees above normal.  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  Heating Season  Inventories may drop to 1.549 trillion cubic feet by the
end of the winter heating season, the Energy Department said in
its monthly  Short-Term Energy Outlook  on March 8. Last year,
supplies totaled 1.665 trillion as of April 1, according to
department data.  Today’s storage report “is short-term bearish, but we
still see the market as undervalued relative to storage levels
and anticipate an intermediate-term price recovery to $4.25 or
more,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi Futures
Perspective in New York.  Gas prices at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath,  Louisiana ,
will average $4.10 per million Btu this year, the Energy
Department said in the  Short-Term Energy Outlook . The price is
down from February’s estimate of $4.16.  Production Estimate  Marketed gas production will average 62.29 billion cubic
feet a day this year, up 0.8 percent from 61.82 billion in 2010,
the department estimated in the report.  Industrial demand will average 18.75 billion cubic feet a
day, up from 18.08 billion in 2010, the department predicted.
Demand from power plants will average 20.28 billion cubic feet a
day, up from 20.22 billion.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
280,113 as of 2:36 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 299,000. Volume was 296,615 yesterday. Open interest was
