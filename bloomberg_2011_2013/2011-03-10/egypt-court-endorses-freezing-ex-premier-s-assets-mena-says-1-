An Egyptian court endorsed the
public prosecutor’s decision to freeze the assets of former
Prime Minister  Ahmed Nazif  and other former ministers and
businessmen,  Egypt ’s Middle East News Agency said today.  Those covered by the decision included former Finance
Minister Youssef Boutros-Ghali, former Interior Minister Habib
El-Adly, former Tourism Minister Zoheir Garranah and two former
housing ministers, Mohammed Soliman and Ahmed El-Maghraby, MENA
said.  The prosecutor’s move came after his office received
complaints accusing the officials of wasting public funds, the
Cairo-based agency said.  A number of former ministers and officials have been
investigated or sent for trial on corruption-related charges.
Corruption allegations surrounding former officials and
businessmen close to former President  Hosni Mubarak  fueled the
mass protests that led to Mubarak’s ouster last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
