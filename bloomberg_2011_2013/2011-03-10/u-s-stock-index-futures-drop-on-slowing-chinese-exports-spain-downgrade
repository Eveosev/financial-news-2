U.S. stocks retreated, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to the lowest level since January,
following an increase in jobless claims, a wider American trade
deficit and a slowdown in China’s export growth.    Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  and  United Technologies Corp. (UTX)  slumped at
least 2.3 percent, pacing declines among industrial companies.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  dropped more than 2.9
percent as crude oil declined a third day amid investor concern
that fuel demand will slow.  General Motors Co. (GM)  decreased 2.6
percent after the largest U.S. automaker said Chief Financial
Officer  Chris Liddell  will leave the company next month.  The S&P 500 retreated 1.9 percent to 1,295.11 at 4 p.m. in
New York. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  decreased 228.48
points, or 1.9 percent, to 11,984.61 for the biggest decline
since Aug. 11. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index tumbled 1.2 percent as  Spain ’s credit rating was downgraded by Moody’s Investors
Service. Crude oil fell 1.6 percent to $102.70 a barrel.  “There are so many uncertainties that it’s hard to want to
bid up this market,” said  James Paulsen , chief investment
strategist at Minneapolis-based Wells Capital Management, which
oversees about $340 billion. “On top of claims popping back up,
there’s worsening in the trade deficit at a time when the
emerging world is slowing down and the Middle East crisis
creates an unpredictable environment for oil. To make matters
worse, Spain gets downgraded, which is an indication that the
European crisis may be far from being put to bed.”  Middle East Turmoil  The  S&P 500  has fallen 3.6 percent from this year’s highest
level on Feb. 18 as oil surged 19 percent amid unrest in Libya
and the Middle East. The benchmark for U.S. equities has rallied
91 percent from its bear-market low on March 9, 2009, amid
government stimulus measures and as corporate earnings beat
analysts’ estimates for eight straight quarters.  The benchmark gauge for U.S. equities fell below its
average price from the past 50 days, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The 130 trading days that it remained above that
level was the longest since early 2007, according to Bespoke
Investment Group.  “Since the 50-day moving average is used by certain
momentum-based traders, it would imply lower prices” if the
index falls below, said Arthur Huprich, an analyst with Raymond
James & Associates Inc. Losses may accelerate should the S&P 500
fall below the Feb. 24 intraday low of 1,294.26, he said.  Jobless Claims Rise  Stock futures fell before the open of exchanges as the
Labor Department said applications for first-time  unemployment
benefits  rose by 26,000 to 397,000 in the week ended March 5.
Economists forecast claims would climb to 376,000, according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. Separately, the
Commerce Department said the trade deficit in goods and services
rose 15 percent to $46.3 billion in January as a surge in
imports led by costlier oil overshadowed record exports.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index dropped to minus 44.5
in the period through March 6 from the prior week’s minus 39.7,
which was close to the best level since 2008. Sentiment suffered
the most among  respondents  who lacked a full-time job or any
employment and those earning less than $50,000 a year.  The U.S. government, facing a record annual fiscal
shortfall and a congressional impasse over financing, posted the
largest monthly deficit ever in February, reflecting increased
spending. The gap totaled $222.5 billion last month compared
with a $220.9 billion shortfall in February 2010, according to
the  Treasury Department ’s monthly budget statement released
today in  Washington .    China , Spain  Earlier losses in U.S. futures also followed China’s
unexpected $7.3 billion trade deficit, the biggest in seven
years, buttressing the government’s case against U.S. arguments
for faster gains in the yuan. European shares fell as Spain’s
rating was cut to Aa2 by Moody’s, which said the cost of shoring
up the banking industry will top government estimates.  “There’s just a lot going on,” said Tommy Huie, who
oversees about $33 billion as president and chief investment
officer of M&I Investment Management in  Milwaukee . “I don’t
think anyone is willing to commit large positions at this point.
Investors will take a wait-and-see approach over the next week
or two to rethink their strategy.”  Stocks of companies that are tied to economic growth,
including commodity producers and technology firms, posted some
of the biggest declines in the S&P 500. The Morgan Stanley
Cyclical Index slumped 2.1 percent as 29 of its 30 stocks fell.  Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction
equipment, dropped 3.9 percent to $98.39. United Technologies,
the maker of Pratt & Whitney jet engines, retreated 2.4 percent
to $80.92.  Energy Shares Slump  Energy shares had the biggest decline in the S&P 500 within
10 industries, falling 3.6 percent. Exxon dropped 3.6 percent to
$81.38. Chevron retreated 3 percent to $99.08.  General Motors declined 2.6 percent to $31.42. The
automaker said Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer Chris
Liddell will leave the company April 1. Dan Ammann, 38, will
succeed Liddell as chief financial officer. Amman had been
treasurer and a corporate vice president.  The Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index of 12 stocks rallied 1.8
percent as concern about higher energy costs eased.  JetBlue
Airways Corp. (JBLU)  gained 4.2 percent to $6.  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) 
advanced 2.8 percent to $11.18.    Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR)  surged a record 41
percent to $61.71 after agreeing to distribute  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) ’s
coffee and teas for its single-serve Keurig brewing systems.
Starbucks climbed 9.9 percent to $37.97 for the biggest increase
in the S&P 500.  H&R Block Rallies    H&R Block Inc. (HRB)  advanced 4.3 percent to $15.84. The biggest
U.S. tax preparer posted a third-quarter profit of 6 cents a
share excluding some items, beating the average analyst estimate
of 5 cents, according to Bloomberg data.  The stock market’s retreat from a February peak may be just
as short as its dip in November, Dahlman Rose & Co. said. The
gauge rebounded at the technical support level on its General
Overview Charts both weeks since the 32-month high on Feb. 18,
data from Bloomberg and Dahlman Rose show. In November, after
the index recovered at the same support level for three weeks,
the S&P 500 had its best December return since 1991 and rose for
the next two months.  Rick Bensignor, chief market strategist at Dahlman Rose,
said the resilience in the stock market may force him to abandon
his “overly cautious stance,” including an estimate that the
S&P 500 may drop as low as 1,230. Should the S&P 500 close
tomorrow at or near this week’s high, the market may be headed
for further gains, he said.  “Buying stocks is still en vogue for most, and while
sellers are chompin’ at the bit for some solid reason to hit the
red button, they haven’t yet found due cause,” Bensignor wrote
in a note yesterday. “Should we go out near the highs of the
week this Friday, I suspect we need to think that another leg up
is coming, and one we’d not want to fight.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
