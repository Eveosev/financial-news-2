  Co-operative Bank of Kenya Ltd. (COOP) ,
the nation’s third-biggest lender by assets, retreated to the
lowest level in five months after reporting full-year profit
that didn’t meet expectations.  The stock dropped 55 cents, or 2.9 percent, to 18.3
shillings by the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi, the capital, a fourth
day of declines.  Co-op Bank, as the lender is known, posted a 55 percent
increase in full-year profit to 4.59 billion shillings ($54.6
million), or 1.31 shillings per share, in the 12 months through
December, Chief Executive Officer Gideon Muriuki told reporters
today in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital. Estimates for earnings per
share were as high as 1.41 shillings and as low as 1.08
shillings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “It was good growth but from a market perspective, they
did not quite meet expectations because there was over-
optimism,” George Bodo, an analyst with Nairobi-based Genghis
Capital Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
