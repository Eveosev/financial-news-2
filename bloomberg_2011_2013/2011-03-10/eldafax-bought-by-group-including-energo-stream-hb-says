     March 10 (Bloomberg) --Teldafax Holding AG,  Germany ’s
biggest independent electricity retailer, has been bought by a
group that includes Russian energy company Energo Stream,
 Handelsblatt  said today, citing people within the company.  The new owners, which include financial investors Sigma
Citation Strategies, CPA Invest and the German fund Debi Select,
agreed to buy the Troisdorf, Germany-based utility for 3.9
million euros ($5.4 million), the newspaper said.  They have ousted Teldafax’s Chief Executive Officer Klaus
Bath and board member Gernot Koch and will replace them this
week, Handelsblatt reported.  Teldafax Spokesman  Thomas Mueller  didn’t immediately return
