The euro may decline to as low as
$1.3538 should it break below a key support level against the
U.S. currency, Commerzbank AG said, citing technical indicators.  “Euro-dollar doesn’t look as if it’s in any hurry to break
above $1.40,”  Karen Jones , head of fixed-income, commodity and
currency  technical analysis  at Commerzbank in London, said in a
telephone interview today. “It has yet to register a close
above $1.3978.”  That level represents the 78.6 percent Fibonacci
retracement from the November peak, Jones said.  The euro weakened 0.5 percent to $1.3840 as of 10:19 a.m.
in London.  “A break below support at the 20-day moving average at
$1.3752 targets a move down toward $1.3538, the 55-day moving
average,” she said.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index.  A support level is an area on a chart where technical
analysts anticipate orders to buy a currency and its related
instruments. The stronger the support, the more selling is
needed to drop below that level. Fibonacci analysis is based on
the theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages after
reaching a high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
