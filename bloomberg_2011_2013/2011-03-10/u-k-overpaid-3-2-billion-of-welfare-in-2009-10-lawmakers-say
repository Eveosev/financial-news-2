The U.K. overpaid 2 billion pounds
($3.2 billion) of welfare payments in the fiscal year ending
April 2010, a panel of lawmakers said, urging the government to
reduce errors in the system.  The cost to the government of mistakes is offset by
1.3 billion pounds of underpayments. Parliament’s Public
Accounts Committee said this meant poor people were missing out.  “The cost of errors in the benefits system is considerable
and hasn’t improved for years,” committee chair Margaret Hodge
said in an e-mailed statement. “People aren’t getting the money
they’re entitled to and the taxpayer is losing out on money paid
when it should not have been.”  Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s government is trying to
reduce complexity in the welfare system to increase incentives
to work, with the aim of reducing unemployment and the long-term
cost. In 2009-10 a total of 148 billion pounds was paid to 20
million people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
