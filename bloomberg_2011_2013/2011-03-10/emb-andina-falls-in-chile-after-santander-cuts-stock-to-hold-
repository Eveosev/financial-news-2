  Embotelladora Andina SA (AKO/A)  fell to its
lowest price in two weeks after Banco Santander SA cut the
company’s rating, saying it expects  Chile ’s largest Coca-Cola
bottler to post “weak” results this year.  Andina retreated 3 percent to 2,103 pesos at 1:31 p.m. New
York time, its lowest price since Feb. 25 on an intraday basis,
and its third consecutive day of losses. The IPSA Index fell 1.6
percent.  Santander cut the stock to “hold” from “buy” and
decreased its year-end price estimate to 2,500 pesos from 3,150
pesos, citing higher costs in 2010 and an expectation for
“weak” results in the first half of this year because of
unfavorable weather for its operations in  Brazil  and higher
sugar and packaging prices.  “We see no short-term catalyst to support the stock,”
analysts including Rodrigo Ordonez and  Luis Miranda  wrote in an
e-mailed note to clients.  Santander also dropped Andina and telecommunications
company Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones SA from its list
of favorite Chilean stocks, and replaced them with retailers
Ripley Corp SA and SACI Falabella.  To contact the reporter on this story:
