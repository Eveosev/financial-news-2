Krishnamurthy Harihar, Mumbai-based
treasurer at FirstRand Ltd., comments on the outlook for  India ’s
rupee.  One-month non-deliverable forwards for the currency were
little changed at 45.27 per dollar from 45.28 yesterday as of
11:33 a.m. in Singapore, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The contracts reflect bets the rupee will decline 0.4
percent from the spot rate of 45.0675.  “The government’s efforts to bring down the budget and
trade deficits are positives for the rupee. This is offset by
the increase in  oil prices , causing the rupee to be range-bound.
As soon as it strengthens to 44, it is pulled back to around
45.20.  “Oil prices are something to be watchful of. The problem
in Libya itself doesn’t matter, but the concern is that it has
the potential to spread across the Middle East. It will have an
impact on India’s trade numbers.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
