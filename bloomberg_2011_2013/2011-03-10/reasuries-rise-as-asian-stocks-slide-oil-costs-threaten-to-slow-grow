Treasuries rose for a second day as
Asian stocks fell and a 20 percent rally in crude  oil prices 
over the past month threatened to crimp economic growth.  Ten-year yields approached the lowest level in a week after
a Chinese report showed exports grew the least in 15 months. The
U.S. is scheduled to sell $13 billion of 30-year bonds today
after demand increased at a 10-year auction yesterday.  “I’m bullish” on Treasuries, said Takuya Yamamoto, who
helps oversee the equivalent of $115.3 billion as a portfolio
manager in Tokyo at Diam Co., a unit of Dai-ichi Life Insurance
Co., Japan’s second-largest life insurer. “Growth will continue,
but with some problems.” Diam bought Treasuries in December,
Yamamoto said.  The yield on the 10-year note declined two basis points to
3.45 percent as of 7:02 a.m. in  London , according to BGCantor
Market Data. The 3.625 percent security maturing in February
2021 rose 5/32, or $1.56 per $1,000 face amount, to 101 13/32.
The rate dropped eight basis points yesterday and fell to 3.447
percent, the lowest since March 2.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares slid 1.4 percent, the
most in two weeks. Crude oil for April delivery traded at $105 a
barrel, after rising to $106.95 on March 7, the highest since
Sept. 26, 2008.  Chinese exports rose 2.4 percent in February from a year
earlier, the slowest pace since November 2009, the customs
bureau said today.  Oil Concern  Bank of America Merrill Lynch canceled plans to increase
its economic-growth forecast because of oil prices, the company
said in a report to clients.  “We had been leaning toward bumping up our global growth
call,” Ethan S. Harris and Alberto Ades, economists for the
company in  New York , wrote in a March 8 report. “The oil price
surge more than cancels out that upgrade.” Bank of America is
one of the 20 primary dealers obligated to bid at the
government’s debt sales.  The 30-year bonds being sold today yielded 4.60 percent in
pre-auction trading, compared with 4.75 percent at the previous
auction of the securities on Feb. 10.  Investors bid for 2.51 times the amount of debt offered
last month, versus an average of 2.66 for the past 10 sales.
Indirect bidders, the investor group that includes foreign
central banks, bought 43.1 percent of the securities, more than
the 10-auction average of 38.9 percent.  Gross’s Holdings    Bill Gross , who runs the world’s biggest bond fund at
Pacific Investment Management Co., eliminated government-related
debt from his flagship $237 billion Total Return Fund.  The fund held no government-related debt as of Feb. 28,
according to a report on the Pimco  website . Mortgage securities
accounted for 34 percent of holdings at the end of February, the
largest asset class, according to the report.  Treasury 10-year yields should be 1.5 percentage points
higher than they are now, Gross said yesterday on PBS’s Nightly
Business Report. He still holds $30 billion to $40 billion of
U.S. Treasury bills, Gross said in the interview. Yields will
rise when the Fed stops buying Treasuries, he told PBS.  The Fed said in November it would scoop up $600 billion of  government securities  by June 30 to pump money into the economy.
The central bank bought $6.7 billion of debt yesterday.  A rebound in the economy reduced the jobless rate to 8.9
percent in February from 9 percent in January, Labor Department
figures show.  Jobless Claims  First-time claims for jobless benefits totaled 376,000 last
week, holding below the five-year average of 419,800, according
to a Bloomberg News survey of economists before the department
reports the figure today.    Home Depot Inc. (HD) , the world’s largest home improvement
retailer, and  Boeing Co. (BA) , the second-largest aerospace company
in the U.S. behind United Technologies Corp., both plan to hire
temporary workers.  “It’s too soon to buy,” said Hideo Shimomura, who helps
oversee the equivalent of $60.4 billion in Tokyo as chief fund
investor at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., a unit of
Japan’s biggest bank. “Oil will be a temporary factor. The  U.S.
economy  is recovering.”  The spread between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices over the life of the debt, was 2.51
percentage points. The five-year average is 2.08.  Treasuries gained yesterday as the 10-year auction drew a
yield of 3.499 percent, less than the average forecast of 3.535
percent in a Bloomberg News survey of eight of the primary
dealers. Bids amounted to 3.32 times the amount of available
debt, the highest level since April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
