U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  has decided to keep the 50 percent top tax rate
in his March 23 budget because it would be inappropriate to cut
taxes for high earners at a time of job cuts and a pay freeze,
the Financial Times reported, without attribution. Prime
Minister  David Cameron  backs the decision, the FT said, citing
an unidentified official in the Prime Ministerâ€™s office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
