  Equinox Minerals Ltd. (EQN) , which is
taking on a $3.2 billion loan to help finance a bid for  Lundin
Mining Corp. (LUN) , would consider selling some of its target’s assets
to reduce debt.  “We would consider asset sales in the context of non-core,
non-copper assets,”  Craig Williams , chief executive of the
Perth-based company, said today on an analyst call. Equinox may
sell Lundin’s Zinkgruvan zinc mine in Sweden, he said.  Equinox bid C$4.8 billion ($4.95 billion) last month for
Lundin, challenging an agreed takeover from Inmet Mining Corp.
Equinox has a $3.2 billion bridging loan arranged through
Goldman Sachs Lending Partners and Credit Suisse Securities.  The company will seek to restructure about $700 million of
the loan “as soon as practical,” Williams said. It plans to
move the remainder into convertible debt facilities and high-
yield bonds, he said.  Equinox fell 4.7 percent to A$5.12 at the 4:10 p.m. Sydney
time close on the Australian stock exchange, bringing losses so
far this year to 15 percent.  Lundin has a stake in a copper and cobalt venture in the
Democratic Republic of Congo as well as operations in  Portugal ,
Spain, Ireland and Sweden.  Copper producers have been involved in deals worth $9.7
billion so far this quarter, the most since the fourth quarter
of 2006, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, as companies
seek to tap rising demand, driven by  China , the world’s largest
metal consumer. The nation is only 19 percent self-sufficient in
the metal used in wiring and tubes, according to Citigroup Inc..  To contact the reporter on this story:
