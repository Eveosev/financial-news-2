     March 10 (Bloomberg) -  Bwin Interactive Entertainment AG (BWIN) ,
an Austrian online gambling company, expects Germany to
deregulate the betting market, Chief Executive Officer Norbert Teufelberger told Handelsblatt in an interview published today.  Betting in Germany is currently controlled by the regional
states. The government is expected to decide on future betting
rules today, the newspaper said.  “All available arguments speak for an opening of the
strictly regulated market,” Handelsblatt cited Teufelberger as
saying.  Teufelberger said Bwin, which has agreed to be acquired by
the U.K.’s  PartyGaming Plc (PRTY) , is prepared to pay tax in Germany
should the market open.  To contact the reporter on this story:
