  Turkey ’s Nationalist Action Party,
or MHP, has created a political rap anthem to attract younger
voters before general elections on June 12, party leader Devlet Bahceli said.  The  song  criticizes the government of Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  and asks listeners whether they want an honest
government that addresses issues such as unemployment.  The tune was penned to appeal to the more than 9.5 million
voters in Turkey between the ages of 18 and 25, Bahceli said in
remarks in Ankara yesterday carried by the state-run Anatolia
news agency. He called the song, which has been playing for the
last two days, “political rap” or “election rap.”  The MHP would receive 14 percent of the vote if elections
were held today, compared with 44 percent for Erdogan’s Justice
and Development Party, according to a poll published in  Aksam 
newspaper. The MHP’s highest level of support comes from the
unemployed, the poll showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Benjamin Harvey  in Ankara at
