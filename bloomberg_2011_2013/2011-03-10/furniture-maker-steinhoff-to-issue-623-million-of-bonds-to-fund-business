  Steinhoff International Holdings
Ltd. (SHF) , Africa’s largest furniture maker, will issue 450 million
euros ($622 million) of bonds due March 2018 to fund operations
after buying European furniture chain Conforama from  PPR (PP)  SA.  The convertible bonds, which will pay a coupon of 4.5
percent semi-annually and will be priced today according to the
statement, are rated Ba1 with a stable outlook by Moody’s
Investors Service, one notch below investment grade.  The Johannesburg-based company will use the bonds for
“diversifying the debt-maturity profile and to provide
financial flexibility for strategic initiatives,” it said in a
statement today. In January, it agreed to buy Conforama for
1.207 billion euros in cash to strengthen its position in  Europe .  Citigroup Inc. and BNP Paribas SA, the joint bookrunners,
have an overallotment option up to 50 million euros exercisable
until the close of business in  South Africa  on March 14.  Steinhoff dropped as much as 3.2 percent to 24.01 rand
before trading 2.3 percent down at 24.25 rand by 10:22 a.m. in
Johannesburg, the weakest intraday level since March 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
