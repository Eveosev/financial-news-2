Foreign-currency reserves in
 Nigeria  rose to the highest in five months as crude prices
surged, signaling the likelihood that the country’s central bank
may meet banks’ demand for international exchange.  The coffers of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer grew to $36.4
billion, according to data published today on the website of the
Abuja-based Central Bank of  Nigeria . The body, which offers
foreign currency in auctions twice a week, has met lenders’
demand twice in 18 auctions held so far this year.  “An increase in foreign reserve will significantly reduce
the pressure on the central bank to meet Nigeria’s foreign
currency demands,” Victor Ogiemwonyi of Lagos-based Partnership
Investments said in a phone interview today. “This will help
shore up the value of the naira.”  The currency of Sub-Saharan Africa’s second-largest economy
weakened 2 percent against the  U.S. dollar  since the beginning
of the year and was trading at 154.95 by 6:29 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nigeria’s Bonny Light crude traded at $116.85 per barrel
today, compared with $65 a barrel projected by the government of
the West African nation in its 2011 budget. The country relies
on oil for 95 percent of its export income, according to the  Finance Ministry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
