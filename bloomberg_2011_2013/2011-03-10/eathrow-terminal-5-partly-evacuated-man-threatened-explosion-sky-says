London Heathrow ,  Europe ’s busiest
airport, was partially evacuated while a man’s luggage was
inspected following a phone call pointing to his presence there.  The departures area of Heathrow’s Terminal 5, which is used
by British Airways, was closed while police examined a “suspect
package,” BAA Ltd., the airport’s owner, said in a statement.  The luggage’s owner was questioned and released, according
to a Metropolitan Police spokesman who declined to be named,
citing force policy. No one was charged over the incident, which
BAA said has been “stood down.”  “The Terminal 5 departures concourse has now been reopened
following an earlier police incident,” BAA spokesman Stuart Butchers said in an e-mail. “We are sorry for the inconvenience
caused to passengers while police attended.”  The man has gone “on his way,” the police said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
