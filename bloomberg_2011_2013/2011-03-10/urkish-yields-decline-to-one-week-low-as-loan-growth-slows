Turkish bond yields dropped to the
lowest in a week after the central bank said loan growth is
slowing, kindling speculation policy makers won’t raise banks’
reserve requirements right away to prevent a credit bubble.  Two-year benchmark bonds strengthened, with yields
declining 10 basis points to 8.91 percent at the 5 p.m. close in
Istanbul, according to the RBS Istanbul benchmark bond index.
The main ISE National 100 share index rose 1.1 percent to
63,169.22, led by banks, as of the 5:30 p.m. close of equities
trading. The lira weakened 0.2 percent to 1.5829 per dollar.  “We’ve been seeing foreign buying in the  bond market  for a
few days now,” Tufan Comert, a strategist at Garanti Securities
in Istanbul, wrote in an e-mailed report to investors today.
“We may see yields dropping to 8.7 percent to 8.8 percent, as
local banks start buying after they sold due to the squeeze in
lira liquidity.”  Turkish banks have sold bonds to pay for the increase in
reserve requirements and as tension in the Middle East
escalated, helping to drive yields from 6.9 percent in January
to as high as 9.11 percent two days ago, according to Serhan Yenigun, a trader at Finansbank AS in Istanbul.  Credit growth is partially losing momentum after the central
bank raised banks’  reserve requirements  twice since the start of
December, Governor Durmus Yilmaz said in Istanbul late
yesterday. The expansion in loans is now “moderate,” Tevfik Bilgin, the chief banking regulator, told reporters today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
