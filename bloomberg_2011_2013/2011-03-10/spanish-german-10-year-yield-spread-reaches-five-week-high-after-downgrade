The extra yield investors demand to
hold 10-year Spanish bonds instead of benchmark German
securities widened to the most in more than five weeks after  Spain ’s credit rating was cut by Moody’s Investor Service.  The difference in yield, or spread, between the securities
increased eight basis points to 230 basis points, or 2.3
percentage points, as of 7:45 a.m. in London. That’s the most
since Jan. 31. The yield on 10-year Spanish bonds rose three
basis point to 5.54 percent.  Moody’s lowered Spain’s rating one step to Aa2 and said the
outlook is “negative,” citing the cost of shoring up the
banking industry.  The yield spread between Italian and German 10-year bonds
widened eight basis points to 178 basis points, the most since
Jan. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
