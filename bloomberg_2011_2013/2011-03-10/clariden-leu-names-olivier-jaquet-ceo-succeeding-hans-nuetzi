Clariden Leu, a private bank owned
by  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , said Olivier Jaquet will take over as
chief executive officer from Hans Nuetzi as the company aims to
improve profitability.  Jaquet, 41, who since 2006 has been the CEO of Credit
Suisse Trust, a unit that manages 100 billion Swiss francs ($107
billion) in assets, is taking over immediately, the Zurich-based
company said in an e-mailed statement today.  Nuetzi led the private bank since November 2007, when
Bernard Stalder resigned because of personal reasons, and helped
integrate businesses at the company after Credit Suisse merged
five units to form Clariden Leu earlier that year. That
integration is now complete and Nuetzi will remain a senior
adviser to the chairman, the bank said.  “He has done an excellent job,” Clariden Leu Chairman
Peter Eckert said by telephone. “The board of directors and Mr.
Nuetzi were of the opinion that the time has come for a change
to tackle the next step for the bank, namely dynamic growth.”  Clariden Leu, which managed 96 billion francs in assets at
the end of 2010, saw clients withdraw a net 1.1 billion francs
over the past two years. That compares with Credit Suisse’s
targets for its private banking business as a whole to add at
least 6 percent of assets under management in net new money
annually. Clariden Leu posted pretax earnings of 260 million
francs last year on revenue of 1.07 billion francs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
