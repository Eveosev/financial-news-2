Gunmen in  Nigeria  attacked villages
in the northern state of Bauchi at dawn today, killing three
people in a region roiled by recent sectarian fighting, police
said.  The bodies were recovered from the wreckage of houses razed
by the attackers in the Tafawa Balewa district of the state,
Police Commissioner Abdulkadir Indabawa told reporters in Bauchi
city, the state capital. Police reinforcements have been sent to
the area “to restore law and order,” he said.  At least 18 people were killed and several churches and
mosques burned during clashes between Christian and Muslim
ethnic groups in Tafawa Balewa in January, police said.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s top oil producer and most populous
country of more than 140 million people, is roughly split
between a mainly Muslim north and a predominantly Christian
south. More than 14,000 people died in ethnic and religious
clashes in the West African nation between 1999 and 2009,
according to the Brussels-based  International Crisis Group .  Bauchi is in Nigeria’s so-called middle belt region where
mainly Christian ethnic groups live alongside Muslims.  In Plateau state, south of Bauchi, multiple bomb blasts on
Christmas Eve killed 80 people and sparked reprisal attacks by
Muslim and Christian groups. A radical Islamic sect said it was
responsible for the blasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
