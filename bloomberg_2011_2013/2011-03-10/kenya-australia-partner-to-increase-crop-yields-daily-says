Small-scale farmers in  Kenya  have
partnered with scientists in an Australian-funded plan to boost
crop yields amid a drought and as climate changes reduces the
amount of land available to grow food,  Business Daily  reported.  The Australian government provided 1.6 billion shillings
($19 million) for the four-year program, the Nairobi-based
newspaper said, citing project leader Mulugetta Mekuria. The
objective is to increase corn and legume yields by 30 percent by
2020, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
