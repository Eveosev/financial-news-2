PT Tambang Batubara Bukit Asam,  Indonesia ’s state-owned coal producer, reported 2010 profit that
fell below estimates due to higher production costs and lower
sales prices for the fuel.  Net income declined to 2 trillion rupiah ($229 million), or
872 rupiah a share, from 2.7 trillion rupiah, or 1,184 rupiah a
share, a year earlier, the Tanjung Enim, South Sumatra-based
company said in a statement published in Investor Daily
Indonesia. Revenue fell to 7.9 trillion rupiah from 8.9 trillion.  That’s compared with an average estimate of 2.15 trillion
rupiah net income and 8.44 trillion rupiah in revenue, according
to 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Mining companies in Indonesia, the world’s largest exporter
of thermal-coal and tin, had to spend more to cope with rising
crude  oil prices  that increased more than 15 percent last year,
boosting the cost of production.  Bukit Asam posted a 4 percent increase in cost of goods
sold last year to 4.26 trillion rupiah, while the average coal
selling price to domestic buyers dropped 18 percent to 612,366 a
metric ton, it said in a separate e-mailed statement.  Bukit Asam shares fell 1.2 percent to 20,300 rupiah in
Jakarta trading yesterday. The stock has fallen more than 15
percent this year, compared with the 3.5 percent declined on the
benchmark  Jakarta Composite index. (JCI)   To contact the reporter on this story:
