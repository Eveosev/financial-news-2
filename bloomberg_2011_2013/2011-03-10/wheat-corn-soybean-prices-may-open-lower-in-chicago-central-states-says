Wheat futures may open 5 cents to 6
cents a bushel lower on the  Chicago  Board of Trade after a
government report showed increasing world stockpiles and
declining U.S. exports, said Jason Britt, the president of
brokerage Central States Commodities Inc. in Kansas City,
Missouri.  Corn futures may open 5 cents to 6 cents lower a bushel
after the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  raised its estimate for
global reserves, Britt said. Soybean futures may open 5 cents to
6 cents a bushel lower, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
