  Ivory Coast ’s President-elect
Alassane Ouattara said an African Union panel tasked with
resolving his country’s post-election crisis recommended he form
a government “that will take into account other parties and
civil society.”  “I will take the best people in Ivory Coast to run a
disastrous situation,” he told reporters in Addis Ababa today.
He said he would arrange an “honorable exit” for incumbent
leader  Laurent Gbagbo , who refused to step down after the Nov.
28 election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
