The  Federal Reserve ’s assets rose
by $32 billion to a record $2.58 trillion, the sixth high in as
many weeks, as the central bank bought  Treasury securities  in
the second round of its quantitative easing strategy.  Treasuries held by the Fed increased by $29.8 billion to
$1.27 trillion as of yesterday. The Fed’s holdings of mortgage-
backed securities were unchanged at $948.9 billion and federal
agency debt held at $143.2 billion, according to a weekly
release by the central bank today.  The central bank has purchased $418.5 billion in Treasuries
since Nov. 12 under plans to buy $600 billion of government debt
through June and reinvest proceeds from maturing mortgage debt.
The unconventional monetary easing is aimed at spurring economic
growth and preventing inflation from falling too low.  M2  money supply  rose by $15.9 billion in the week ended
Feb. 28, the Fed said. That left M2 growing at an annual rate of
3.9 percent for the past 52 weeks, below the target of 5 percent
the Fed once set for maximum growth. The Fed no longer has a
formal target.  The Fed reports two measures of the money supply each week.
M1 includes all currency held by consumers and companies for
spending, money held in checking accounts and travelers checks.
M2, the more widely followed, adds savings and private holdings
in money market.  M1 increased $21.1 billion, and over the past 52 weeks M1
rose 9.4 percent, according to the central bank. The Fed no
longer publishes figures for M3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
