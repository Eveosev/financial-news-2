  Spain ’s IBEX 35 index fell for a

at the 5:30 p.m. close in Madrid. The Madrid Stock Exchange
General Index retreated 1.1 percent.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
Spanish market. Symbols are in parentheses after company names.    Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA)   fell for a
first day in three, losing 1.7 percent to 8.41 euros. Spanish
lenders dropped after Spain’s credit rating was cut to Aa2 by
Moody’s Investors Service, which said the cost of supporting the
country’s banks will eclipse the government’s estimates.    Bankinter SA (BKT)   retreated 1.6 percent to 4.58 euros.  Banco Popular Espanol SA (POP)   also fell 1.2 percent to 4.19
euros.  Banco Espanol de Credito SA (BTO)   slipped 0.9 percent
to 6.53 euros.    Banco Santander SA (SAN)   retreated 1.4 percent to 8.17
euros, the stock’s third drop this week. Spain’s Supreme Court
upheld a conviction against Santander’s Chief Executive Officer
Alfredo Saenz and suspended him from banking for three months.  Santander will appeal the sentence handed down to Saenz for
making a false accusation, an official for the bank said in a
phone interview, while the lender said in a filing to regulators
that its board backed Saenz to continue as CEO.    Grupo Ezentis SA (EZE)   sank for the first day this week,
losing 5.7 percent to 51.3 euro cents. The Spanish engineering
company plans to sell 60 million euros ($82.9 million) of
assets, including investments in  Vertice Trescientos Sesenta
Grados SA (VER) , health concessions and a waste-treatment plant, the
company said in a regulatory filing today. Vertice shares slid
0.4 percent to 25 euro cents.    Iberdrola Renovables SA (IBR)   dropped for the first day
in five, sliding 0.9 percent to 3.01 euros. The world’s largest
owner of wind parks was cut to “hold” from “buy” at Caja
Madrid Bolsa.    Repsol YPF SA (REP)   slumped 1.9 percent to 23.75 euros,
extending yesterday’s loss. Spain’s biggest oil company will
start a steam boiler at its Petronor refinery in Bilbao, Spain,
and may halt a unit next week for planned maintenance.    Tubos Reunidos SA (TRG)   fell 1.5 percent to 1.97 euros,
erasing yesterday’s gain and the steepest drop in a week. The
Spanish maker of seamless steel pipes that was founded in 1892
will resume dividend payments this year. Tubos predicted that it
will return to profit because of increasing orders and higher
prices.  “Pricing visibility for the first semester is
satisfactory,” Chairman Pedro Abasolo said in the March 8
interview, adding that prices “obviously” have yet to match
those in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
