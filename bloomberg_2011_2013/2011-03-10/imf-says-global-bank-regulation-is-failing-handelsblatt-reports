An International Monetary Fund
report shows that regulators haven’t gone far enough in taming
potential financial-market excesses since the economic crisis
began, the  Handelsblatt newspaper  reported.  Banks remain too big and their businesses even more complex
even after efforts to curb their latent capacity to rock the
financial system, according to the IMF report that is published
today, the newspaper said.  “We are at the moment even less well-prepared than when
the crisis erupted in 2007,” Handelsblatt cites the report as
saying. Co-written by IMF Chief Economist  Olivier Blanchard , the
document also says investors are switching to financial
institutions that are less regulated, such as  hedge funds , in
search of profit, creating new risks for the financial system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
