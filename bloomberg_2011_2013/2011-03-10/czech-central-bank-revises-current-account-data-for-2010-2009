The Czech current-account deficit
as a share of gross domestic product is now seen at 3.8 percent
in 2010 compared with an earlier estimate of 2.6 percent, the
central bank said.  The deficit for 2009 was also revised to about 3.2 percent
of GDP from 1.5 percent previously, the bank said today on its
website, citing a new method of calculating the indicator.  The current-account deficit for the fourth quarter narrowed
to 843 million euros ($1.16 billion), the central bank said,
compared with a revised figure of 3.64 billion euros in the
previous three-month period, the central bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
