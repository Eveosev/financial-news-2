  IStar Financial Inc. (SFI) , the
commercial real-estate lender that’s extending debt maturities
to avoid restructuring, has received commitments from lenders
for a $3 billion loan, according to three people with knowledge
of the situation.  The company, which increased rates on $1.5 billion of the
loan earlier today, will issue portions of it as soon as Friday
and anticipates funding on March 15, said the people, who
declined to be named because the deal is private. Proceeds will
be used to repay secured loans maturing in June 2011 and 2012
and a portion of the company’s unsecured debt maturing this
year.  Chief Executive Officer Jay Sugarman is taking advantage of
loan prices approaching a three-year high as the New York-based
company deals with $2.7 billion of debt scheduled to mature this
year. Shares of IStar, which has funded properties including the
Trump SoHo hotel-condominium building in lower  Manhattan , have
risen 8.5 percent since the company announced on Feb. 22 that it
engaged JPMorgan Chase & Co. to arrange the $3 billion facility.  “The completion of the proposed $3 billion bank
refinancing transaction would be a major milestone for the
company,” said  Michael Kim , an analyst at CRT Capital Group in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “It would address the near-term maturity
profile and remove the risk of a restructuring.”  Jason Fooks, a representative for IStar, declined to
comment.  Commitment Deadline  JPMorgan had given lenders until 5 p.m. today in  New York 
to let the bank know if they were participating in the deal, the
people said. The $3 billion facility will refinance about $380
million of senior unsecured bank debt due 2011 and $2.6 billion
of secured bank debt due 2011 and 2012, according to CRT’s Kim.  A $1.5 billion A-2 debt due June 2014 will pay 5.5
percentage points more than the London interbank offered rate,
compared with 4.75 percentage points initially proposed, said
the people who declined to be identified because the terms are
private. The floor on the lending benchmark remains at 1.25
percent, and the company will sell the loan at 98.5 cents on the
dollar, as initially proposed, the people said.  Lenders will get 18 months of soft-call protection, the
person said, meaning that IStar would have to pay 1 cent more
than face value for the first year to reprice the debt, then 0.5
cent more than face value to cut pricing on the loan in the next
six months.  A $1.5 billion A-1 loan due in June 2013 will pay
3.25 percentage points more than Libor with a 1.25 percent
floor, the people said. That debt will be sold at 99.5 cents on
the dollar.  Loan Prices  The Standard & Poor’s/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index,
which tracks the 100 largest dollar-denominated first-lien
leveraged loans climbed to 96.48 cents on the dollar on Feb. 14,
which was the highest since November 2007. The measure has
declined since then and dropped to 95.75 cents yesterday.  “All three rating agencies issued reports noting that the
successful completion of the proposed facilities would prompt
multiple notch upgrades across the  capital structure  and at the
corporate level,” CRT’s Kim said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
