A total of 147 investment
institutions have agreed so far to the U.K.’s first formal code
setting out shareholders’ duties, the Financial Times reported.  Sarah Hogg, who chairs the  Financial Reporting Council ,
will announce the figure at the conference of the National
Association of Pension Funds today, the newspaper said.  Rising support for the stewardship code, which is aimed at
improving scrutiny of companies by their owners, will strengthen
its credibility before the European Commission publishes a paper
on corporate governance, probably next month, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
