The Hungarian state should be
present in the country’s energy sector as an owner because its
role as a regulator is not sufficient,  MTI  said, citing National
Development Minister Tamas Fellegi.  “Regulatory tools are not enough, they don’t provide
sufficient room to manoeuvre,” the newswire reported.  The minister said there must be competition in the  energy
industry  and the government would like to “bring back” the
state’s role, according to MTI. Fellegi didn’t give details on
plans for establishing state ownership in the sector, MTI said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
