Take-home pay growth at Britain’s
largest listed companies slowed in the quarter through February
as factories reduced salaries for the first time since at least
2004,  VocaLink Ltd.  said.  Incomes after tax and other deductions rose 0.5 percent
from a year earlier, tying with May 2010 as the slowest pace
since records began seven years ago, the group said in an e-
mailed statement in  London  today. Pay growth in the quarter
through January was 0.6 percent.  Pay at manufacturers fell 0.6 percent, the first decline on
record, while the pace of wage growth eased to 0.6 percent from
0.7 percent at service companies, according to VocaLink.  The company, which processes 90 percent of British salaries
paid directly to bank accounts, used salary-payment data from
more than 200 members of the U.K.’s  FTSE 350 Index (NMX)  and more than
600 government-related organizations for the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Scott Hamilton  in London at
