Annie Lennox,  Paloma Faith  and Kate Nash will be rocking  London ’s Southbank Centre as part of the
“Wow -- Women of the World” Festival.  Lennox -- known for her Eurythmics hits such as “Sisters
Are Doin’ It for Themselves” -- has organized tomorrow’s fast-
moving concert through Equals, her partnership of 20 charities.  The Royal Festival Hall show, celebrating the centenary of
International Women’s Day, is followed by a second gig featuring
Speech Debelle and  Baaba Maal  on March 12.  Information:  http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk ,

and Tracey Emin can be seen in an Old Bond Street gallery. Emin
takes Bourgeois’s suggestive blobs --gouaches of naked men and
woman -- and sketches over them.  Luckily for Emin, the French-born doyenne lived long enough
to give the doodles her approval; she died last year at age 98.  “Louise Bourgeois and Tracey Emin: Do Not Abandon Me”
ends March 12 at  Hauser & Wirth , 15 Old Bond Street, London W1S
4AX. Information:  http://www.hauserwirth.com  or call +44-20-
7399-9770.  Automat, a couple of streets away from Hauser & Wirth, is
an up-market American diner with Mayfair prices. If you fancy a
burger and fries, and maybe an ice cream, this is the place for
you. The best tables are the booths in the paneled section of
Automat, close to the front. Information:

spines.  The mad scientist looks on as his Creature pops out of a
pouch in the  National Theatre ’s new staging. Director Danny Boyle last filmed actor  James Franco  sawing off his own arm in
“127 Hours.”  Here, the lead actors swap roles on different nights. While
Jonny Lee Miller and  Benedict Cumberbatch  are both good,
Cumberbatch adds depth to the raging monster.  “Frankenstein” is in repertory at the National Theatre.
Information:  http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk . or call
+44-20-7452-3000.  Across Waterloo Bridge from the National Theatre, one of
London’s oldest Indian eateries is tucked away in a rundown
building. The India Club has been there for decades and it isn’t
to everyone’s taste: It’s scruffy and cheap without being
cheerful. Yet it is a favorite for diners who enjoy a cafe
unchanged by the passage of time. Information: 2nd Floor, Strand
Continental Hotel, 143 Strand, WC2R 1JA or +44-20-7836-0650.  Sunday  Spot a dish or two on your Sunday stroll in the park.    Anish Kapoor  has scattered a couple of his giant mirrored
disks around Kensington Gardens, along with a curving wall and a
pointy spire. It’s your last chance to see them in their leafy
temporary habitat, a stone’s throw from  the Serpentine Gallery :
the display’s last day is March 13.  Information:  http://www.serpentinegallery.org  or
