  Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , the mail-order and
online movie-rental service, doesn’t view Warner Bros.’ plan to
offer $3 film rentals on Facebook as a greater threat than other
rivals pose, Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said.  “Nobody goes to Facebook to watch movies,” Sarandos said
in an interview today at a film finance conference in Los
Angeles. Netflix will eventually get shows from Warner Bros.’
sister company HBO by offering to pay the cable channel the
“right amount,” he said.  Netflix fell 5.8 percent on March 8, the day  Time Warner
Inc. (TWX) ’s Warner Bros. studio announced plans to offer rentals on
the Facebook Inc. social network for $3, starting with “The  Dark Knight .” That sent the price of  Los Gatos , California-
based Netflix below $200 for the first time since January.  Netflix, which charges a monthly fee for its service, rose
$7.03, or 3.6 percent, to $200.02 at 4:30 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Time Warner fell 84 cents, or 2.3
percent, to $35.69 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
