South African President  Jacob Zuma 
urged Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi to immediately halt all acts
of violence against his people, Foreign Minister Maite Nkoana- Mashabane said.  “Qaddafi called our president, needlessly, to try and
explain his side of the story,” Nkoana-Mashabane told reporters
in Pretoria today. “We took advantage of that call by Qaddafi,
through our president, to tell him how we abhor this heinous
violation of human rights against his own people.”  Conflict in Libya began as a popular protest movement
against Qaddafi’s four-decade rule and evolved into a civil war
between armed camps after sections of Libya’s army deserted to
the rebels. Qaddafi has used air and artillery strikes against
his opponents.    South Africa  co-sponsored all resolutions against Libya
that were adopted by the  United Nations Security Council  and led
a campaign to suspend the North African nation from the UN Human
Rights Council, Nkoana-Mashabane said.  South Africa also blocked past bids by Qaddafi to be
appointed as permanent head of the 53-nation African Union and
to establish a United States of Africa, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Franz Wild  in Johannesburg at
