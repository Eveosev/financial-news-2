European Central Bank council
member  Yves Mersch  said rate setters make decisions based on
available information and they “never had the habit to make
announcements in advance.”  “Markets have a responsibility,” Mersch, who is also head
of Luxembourg’s central bank, said at a press conference in
Luxembourg today. “We’re observing reactions to our
announcements. We have our own responsibility, which is that we
stick to our objective to maintain  price stability  in the medium
term in the  euro zone  and to ensure that inflationary
expectations stay perfectly anchored.”  Mersch also said the euro region is in a situation of
“extreme uncertainty,” with markets in a “waiting position,”
as governments seek ways to restore investor confidence. The
European Financial Stability Facility should become more
flexible and “the instruments that are at the” fund’s
“disposal need to be more extensive,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
