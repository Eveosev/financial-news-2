Egyptian inflation eased in
February, as increases in food prices, one of the causes of the
unrest that toppled President  Hosni Mubarak , slowed.  The inflation rate in urban parts of  Egypt , the gauge that
the central bank monitors, fell to 10.7 percent from 10.8
percent in January, the Central Agency for Public Mobilization
and Statistics said on its  website t oday. Prices climbed 0.1
percent in the month. Food price inflation eased to 18.2 percent
from 18.9 percent.  “There isn’t a need to change interest rates with
inflation, again, being driven by food prices,” said Mohamed Rahmy, a Cairo-based economist with investment bank Beltone
Financial. “Food-price inflation has generally been driven by
the rise of international prices of food items.”  Eighteen days of protests in Egypt, sparked by falling
living standards and high unemployment as well as a lack of
democratic rights, led to the ouster of Mubarak on Feb. 11.  The economy is reeling under the impact of the uprising.
Economic growth may slow this year to about 4 percent from 5.1
percent in the fiscal year that ended in June, Finance Minister
Samir Radwan said on Feb. 12.  The central bank on Jan. 27 left its benchmark overnight
deposit rate at 8.25 percent and the overnight lending rate at
9.75 percent, saying inflationary pressures remained
“contained.” The Monetary Policy Committee, which is due to
meet today, last raised  interest rates  in September 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
