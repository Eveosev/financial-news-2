Continental AG offered lenders
joining a  credit line  initial interest ranging from 250 basis
points to 300 basis points more than benchmark lending rates,
two people with knowledge of the deal said.    Europe ’s second-largest tiremaker is seeking 6 billion
euros ($8.3 billion) of term loans and revolving credits for as
long as three years to replace maturing debt, said the people,
who declined to be identified because the financing is private.  Antje Lewe, a spokeswoman for Continental, declined to
comment on details of the refinancing.  Hanover, Germany-based Continental agreed to pay interest
of between 475 basis points and 500 basis points more than
benchmark lending rates for its existing loans, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The debt stems from Continental’s
2007 acquisition of Siemens AG’s VDO unit for 11.4 billion
euros. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Loan issuers in the same ratings category as Continental
paid an average margin of 335 basis points in the past six
months on European loans, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Continental’s debt is rated B by Standard & Poor’s
and B1 by Moody’s Investors Service.  Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG are coordinating the
refinancing, the data show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  To contact the reporters on this story:
