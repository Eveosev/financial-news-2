Hong Kong stocks fell the most in a
week as automakers declined after escalating violence in  Libya 
boosted oil prices, and as metal producers fell.  Dongfeng Motor Group Co., Chinese partner of Nissan Motor
Co., sank 2.8 percent after growth in car sales in the nation
slowed. Jiangxi Copper Co.,  China ’s biggest producer of the
metal, dropped 3.5 percent after metal prices fell.  China
Resources  Land Ltd., a state-controlled developer, retreated 0.6
percent after the nation’s housing ministry said it is asking
local governments to set price-control targets.  The Hang Seng Index dropped 0.8 percent to 23,614.89 at the
close, the steepest decline since March 2. More than four stocks
fell for every one that rose in the 45-member gauge. The Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index of H shares of Chinese companies
declined 0.7 percent to 12,992.50 today.  “Higher oil prices are creating a lot of uncertainty in
the market and will continue to drag on global markets,” said  Alex Au , managing director of Richland Capital Management Ltd.
in Hong Kong, which oversees $300 million of assets. “At this
moment, you have to price in certain risks in the market.”  Dongfeng Motor slid 2.8 percent to HK$13.80, while
Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., a Chinese partner of Toyota
Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co., lost 3.7 percent to HK$9.63.
Weichai Power Co., a diesel-engine maker, sank 1.4 percent to
HK$50.35.  Car Sales  Wholesales of passenger cars including multipurpose and
sport-utility vehicles increased 2.6 percent to 967,200 units
last month from a year earlier, the China Association of
Automobile Manufacturers said yesterday, the slowest pace of
growth since January 2009.  Automakers also declined after crude  oil prices  surged as
violence in Libya escalated, raising concern demand will slow
with more expensive fuel.  Crude for April delivery rose as much as 0.6 percent in
after-hours trading in  New York  today as forces loyal to Libyan
leader  Muammar Qaddafi  carried out strikes on oil facilities.  Copper futures for May delivery dropped 2.9 percent to the
lowest in more than two months in New York yesterday on concern
demand will wane as higher energy costs slow the global economy.
London Metal Exchange Index of six metals including aluminum and
copper lost 2.5 percent yesterday.  Jiangxi Copper slumped 3.5 percent to HK$23.50, while
Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd., the country’s No. 1 producer of
the metal, declined 0.4 percent to HK$7.48.  Developers Fall  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  has risen 2.5 percent this year as
economic data and corporate earnings helped counter concern
surging oil prices from the tensions in the Middle East will
derail global economic growth. Shares in the gauge traded at an
average 12.9 times estimated earnings yesterday, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Developers fell on concern China’s government will take
more steps to curb property prices. China Resources slid 0.6
percent to HK$12.96, while Guangzhou R&F Properties Co., the
biggest real-estate company in the southern Chinese city,
dropped 0.8 percent to HK$10.46.  China’s housing ministry is asking local governments to set
price-control targets by the end of March, Minister Jiang Weixin
said in Beijing.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index fell 0.5 percent to 23,640.
The HSI Volatility Index, the benchmark gauge for  Hong Kong 
stock options, increased 3 percent to 19.05, indicating options
traders expect a swing of 5.5 percent in the Hang Seng Index in
the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
