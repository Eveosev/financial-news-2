Overseas investors bought a net
2.07 billion rupees ($45.9 million) of Indian equities yesterday,
reducing their outflow from stocks this year to 75.2 billion
rupees, the nation’s market regulator said.  Foreigners purchased 18.6 billion rupees of shares and sold
16.5 billion rupees, the  Securities and Exchange Board of India 
said  today . They sold a net 7.77 billion rupees of bonds, paring
their purchases in debt this year to 127.1 billion rupees.  Global investors, attracted by  India ’s economic expansion,
bought a record 1.33 trillion rupees of shares in 2010, lifting
the benchmark index 17 percent and making it the best performer
among the world’s 10 biggest equity markets. They invested 464
billion rupees in bonds last year.  Foreign funds have placed 4.396 trillion rupees in equities
and 913.8 billion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993. The previous record was in 2009 when flows
reached 834.2 billion rupees, sparking the biggest advance in 18
years. Funds withdrew a record 530 billion rupees from stocks in
2008, setting off the worst annual slump.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
