  Kazakhstan  will boost plantings of
grains by 41,000 hectares (101,313 acres) to 16.5 million
hectares in 2011, Interfax reported, citing the
country’s Agriculture Minister Akylbek Kurishbayev.  The increase is needed for livestock farms,
Kurishbayev said, according to Interfax. Some 98 percent of
agricultural farms are supplied with good quality grain seeds
except for two regions in western Kazakhstan, which were
affected by last year’s drought, Interfax reported.  To contact the reporter on this story: Marina Sysoyeva in Moscow
