Oil-storage rates may decline as
capacity-expansion projects lead to an “equalization” of
prices, according to  TankBank , an oil-storage consultant.  “Short term, the capacity issue will lead to an
equalization of rate structures, which may be good news for
those renting tank space,” TankBank Managing Director Tony
Quinn said today in Amsterdam at the European Oil Storage
conference hosted by Platts, the energy-information division of
McGraw-Hill Cos. “I’m already seeing empty tanks on the
European market. Not huge amounts, but here and there.”  Valuations of tank terminals have increased in the past
five years, mainly because of buyers’ strategic considerations,
Quinn said. Purchasers are often the terminals’ biggest
customers and want to ensure availability of storage, he said.  “If you are doing 70 percent of a terminal’s business, and
you hear it’s for sale, you’ll probably want to buy it,” he
said. “Someone else buying it may lead to problems for you.”  The sale by Royal Vopak NV of its stake in the Bahamas Oil
Refining Co. International to U.S. pipeline operator Buckeye
Partners LP this year implied a price equal to about 20 times
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
That compares with multiples around eight to nine times Ebitda
in 2006, Quinn said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
