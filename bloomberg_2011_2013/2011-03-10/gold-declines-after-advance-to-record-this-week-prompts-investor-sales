Gold fell the most in a week as a
stronger dollar prompted some investors to sell the metal after
unrest in the Middle East and northern  Africa  pushed prices to a
record.  The dollar rose against a basket of six major currencies
and oil fell for a third straight day. Gold futures reached an
all-time high of $1,445.70 an ounce on March 7 as violence in  Libya  escalated.  “The weakness in crude oil and the stronger dollar are
pushing gold lower,” said  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath
Trading LLC in  Chicago . “Gold went up and made new highs this
week, but there was no follow-through, so traders are
liquidating their positions because the trade is not working.”  Gold futures for April delivery declined $17.10, or 1.2
percent, to settle at $1,412.50 at 1:51 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , the biggest drop since March 3. The metal has climbed 27
percent in the past year.  “There are short-term traders and investors who want to
reap profits after the rally,” said Chae Un Soo, a Seoul-based
trader with KEB Futures Co. “Losses will be limited as there’s
an enormous interest in gold and precious metals.”  Muammar Qaddafi’s forces resumed air strikes on oil hubs in
the central area of Libya’s coastline that mark the east-west
dividing line in the nation’s civil war. More than 400 people
have been killed and 2,000 wounded in the clash since Feb. 17, a
member of the insurgents’ provisional health committee told
reporters yesterday in Benghazi.  Gold fell as much as 1.9 percent before paring losses after
the  Associated Press  reported that police in  Saudi Arabia  opened
fire at a rally after the government warned it won’t tolerate
protests.  ‘Day of Rage’  Postings on websites have called for a nationwide “Day of
Rage” in Saudi Arabia on March 11. The country is the world’s
biggest oil exporter.  “The real fear is that any of the Middle East upheaval
will spread to Saudi Arabia,” Lesh of FuturePath said.  Silver futures for May delivery fell 98.1 cents, or 2.7
percent, to $35.066 an ounce on the Comex. The price climbed to
$36.745 on March 7, the highest since March 1980. That year, the
metal reached a record $50.35.  Palladium futures for June delivery slid $15.25, or 2
percent, to $766.40 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Platinum futures for April delivery dropped $36.40, or
2 percent, to $1,765.60 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
