Gold output in  South Africa , the
world’s fourth-largest producer of the precious metal, increased
the most in more than 30 years in January as prices traded near
a record high amid investors demand for alternative assets.  Miners in the country produced 15.1 percent more gold
during the month than they did a year earlier, according to a
monthly report from  Statistics South Africa  today. That’s the
biggest monthly increase according to Bloomberg data which goes
back to the start of 1981.  South African gold production in January was skewed by
exceptionally low output a year earlier, Martin Kohler, deputy
director of statistics at the national directorate of mineral
economics, said by phone from  Pretoria  today. He wasn’t
immediately able to comment further.  Gold rose 22 percent to an average of $1,359.98 an ounce
during the month, from $1,116.56 a year earlier. The precious
metal reached a record $1,444.95 an ounce on March 7 as violence
in  Libya  boosted demand.  Total mine production in South Africa rose 4.3 percent in
January from a year earlier, Statistics South Africa spokesman
Jean-Pierre Terblanche said by phone from Pretoria. Iron ore
output fell 36 percent, while production of platinum group
metals climbed 14 percent and copper jumped 31 percent, the
statistics agency said in a report on its website today.  South Africa was the world’s largest gold producer in 2009
after  China ,  Australia  and the U.S., according to the country’s
Chamber of Mines. South Africa was the world’s largest producer
for much of the twentieth century.  To contact the reporter on this story:
