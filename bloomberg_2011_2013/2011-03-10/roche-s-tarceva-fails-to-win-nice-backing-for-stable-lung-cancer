  Roche Holding AG (ROG)  again failed to
win the backing of the U.K.’s health-cost agency for use of the
company’s Tarceva drug to keep the most common form of lung
cancer at bay.  The  National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence 
found it was “uncertain” how much Tarceva extended the life of
patients with non-small-cell lung cancer whose disease remains
stable after treatment with chemotherapy, NICE said today in an
e-mailed statement. The agency recommended the drug as an
initial therapy for the disease in 2008.  The decision confirms the preliminary guidance that NICE
published in June. The agency will make a final decision after
considering any appeals, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
