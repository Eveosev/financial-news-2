Soybean farmers in  Brazil , the
world’s largest grower after the U.S., will harvest an estimated
70.3 million metric tons of the oilseed this year, more than the
70.1 million tons forecast last month, the Agriculture Ministry
said.  Corn growers will harvest 55 million tons, compared with
the 54.5 million tons forecast on Feb. 9, the ministry’s crop
forecasting agency, known as Conab, said in an e-mailed report
today.  Brazil produced 68.7 million tons of soybeans and 56
