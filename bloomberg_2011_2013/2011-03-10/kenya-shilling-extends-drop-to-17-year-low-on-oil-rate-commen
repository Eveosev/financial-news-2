  Kenya ’s shilling depreciated for a
sixth day against the dollar, extending its decline to the
weakest level in 17 years as oil advanced and the country’s
central bank said it supports a flexible  exchange rate .  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy slumped as
much as 0.3 percent to 84.25 per dollar in Nairobi, the weakest
intraday level since March 1994, and traded 0.1 percent down at
84.05 by 10:39 a.m.  Oil climbed in  New York  for the first time in three days as
escalating violence in  Libya , Africa’s third-largest producer,
renewed concern that supply disruptions may spread to the Middle
East. The shilling will “rediscover its path consistent with
fundamentals” once the political crises in North  Africa  and the
Middle East are resolved, Central bank Governor Njuguna Ndung’u
said in an e-mailed report yesterday.  “The rising crude prices and the ongoing crises in the
Middle East and North Africa are weakening the local currency,”
Gideon Muriuki the managing director of Co-Operative Bank Ltd.,
told reporters today in Nairobi.  Inflation quickened for a fourth month in February to 6.5
percent, the highest since October 2009, as fuel costs rose.  Ndung’u said Kenya’s “flexible exchange-rate policy is an
automatic stabilizer meant to absorb the external shocks hitting
the economy. To the central bank, these shocks are temporary and
the exchange-rate movements are fulfilling their role.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
