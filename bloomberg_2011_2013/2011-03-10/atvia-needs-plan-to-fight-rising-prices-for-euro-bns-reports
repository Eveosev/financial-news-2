  Latvia  will create a plan to curb
rising consumer prices which may endanger the countryâ€™s bid to
adopt the euro in 2014, Finance Minister Andris Vilks said,
according to the  Baltic News Service .  An anti-inflation plan may be proposed in the second half
of the year, Vilks said, according to the Riga-based newswire.
The utilities regulator and the competition regulator may play a
role, Vilks said, the newswire reported. The Baltic country
should aim for growth in consumer prices of 2 percent next year,
he said.  Latvian inflation accelerated to 4 percent in February, the
quickest pace in 21 months, as food and fuel costs increased.  To contact the reporter on this story:
