Austria’s economy grew 0.8 percent
in the fourth quarter, more than the 0.6 percent growth
originally estimated by the Vienna-based Wifo economic research
institute.  Fourth-quarter gross domestic product, the value of all
goods and services, grew 0.8 percent after a 1.1 percent rise in
the previous quarter, Wifo said in an e-mailed statement today.
Compared with a year earlier, the economy expanded 2.7 percent,
said the institute, which compiles gross domestic product
figures for the Alpine country’s government.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
