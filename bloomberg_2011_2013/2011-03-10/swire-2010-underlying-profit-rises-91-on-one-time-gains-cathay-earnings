  Swire Pacific Ltd. (19) , the Hong Kong
office landlord which controls  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293) , said
2010 underlying profit rose 91 percent on gains from the sale of
assets and record earnings by the city’s biggest airline.  Swire’s profit excluding property revaluations rose to
HK$16.1 billion ($2.07 billion) from HK$8.48 billion a year
earlier, the company said in a statement filed to Hong Kong’s
stock exchange today. That compares with the HK$12.1 billion
median estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Swire made several one-time gains from deals including the
sale of a stake in an office building in Hong Kong, which has
surpassed Tokyo to become the world’s most expensive place to
rent an office, as corporate expansion in  Asia  boosts demand for
space. The company, which develops and runs Taikoo Place and
Pacific Place office complexes in the city, is also benefiting
from rising regional  travel demand  that helped Cathay Pacific
almost triple 2010 profit.  “Rental should continue to provide support to Swire this
year,”  Kenny Tang , an executive director at Hong Kong-based
AMTD Financial Planning Ltd., said before the earnings were
announced. “Investors will also be watching closely on how  oil
prices  affect Cathay Pacific’s operation.”  No Property IPO  Swire Pacific fell 2.1 percent to HK$112.90 at the 4 p.m.
close of trading in Hong Kong, extending its loss this year to
12 percent. The stock last year surged 36 percent, outpacing the
5 percent gain in Hong Kong’s benchmark  Hang Seng Index. (HSI)   The company has no immediate plan to revive the initial
stock sale for its property division, Swire Pacific Chairman
Christopher Pratt said at a briefing in Hong Kong today.  Underlying profit at Swire Properties Ltd., the group’s
real estate unit and landlord to Societe Generale SA and Time
Warner Inc. in Hong Kong, rose 23 percent to HK$4.86 billion
after the group sold two investment properties in the city, the
company said. Gross rental income from investment properties
rose 6 percent, Swire Pacific said.  “Hong Kong’s commercial property market will continue to
be strong,” said Martin Cubbon, chief executive officer of
Swire Properties. “As we have seen in the last few months, the
increase in rental has been quite strong and demand for
commercial space remains.”    Hong Kong  prime office rents will rise as much as 35
percent in 2011 because of increased demand and limited supply,
Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., the world’s second-biggest commercial
real estate broker, said in December.  Asset Sale  Swire Pacific in November sold a 50 percent stake in the
PCCW Tower at Taikoo Place to property and fund management group
Grosvenor Group Ltd. for a gain of HK$342 million, the company
said in today’s statement. It also made a profit of HK$771
million from the sale of its interest in Crown Beverage Cans in
September, the company said.  Excluding the one-time gains, underlying profit rose to
HK$11.1 billion from HK$8.36 billion, Swire Pacific said in the
statement.  Net income for the group climbed to HK$38.3 billion, or
HK$25.42 a share, from HK$21.9 billion, or HK$14.55 a share, a
year earlier, the company said. Sales rose to HK$29.2 billion
from HK$24.9 billion.  Cathay yesterday posted full-year profit of HK$14 billion,
up from HK$4.7 billion a year earlier. The carrier was expected
to make a full-year profit of HK$13.4 billion based on the
average of 15 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Created as a trading company in  London  in 1816, Swire
Pacific also bottles Coca-Cola in  China  and supplies offshore
oil rigs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
