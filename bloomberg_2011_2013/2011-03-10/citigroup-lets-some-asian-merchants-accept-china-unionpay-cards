  Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest
U.S. bank by assets, agreed to allow its merchants in seven
Asian countries to accept cards from  China UnionPay Co.  as more
mainland tourists travel abroad.  Stores and restaurants that are part of its network in
Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand,  India  and
Vietnam can process point-of-sale and online purchases made
using UnionPay credit and debit cards, the New York-based lender
said in an e-mailed statement today.  UnionPay, China’s largest electronic-payment network, is
expanding its global reach, with more than 2.4 billion cards
accepted in 104 markets outside China. Over the past four
months, UnionPay has reached agreements with lenders including  Germany ’s Wirecard Bank AG, Korea’s BC Card Co., Japan’s Aeon
Co. and Hungary’s OTP Bank Nyrt.  Spending by Chinese tourists abroad will likely increase 14
percent to $55 billion this year, Xinhua News Agency reported on
Jan. 11, citing the  China  Tourism Academy. Privately funded
travel comprised about 90 percent of the 54 million outbound
trips last year, the report said.  Citigroup, based in  New York , in 2005 agreed to accept
UnionPay cards at its global network of automated teller
machines. That accord also allows its international cardholders
to use their cards at UnionPay’s ATMs in China.  Shanghai-based UnionPay was established in 2002 by more
than 80 of the nation’s largest banks and other state-owned
companies.  --Luo Jun. Editor: Chitra Somayaji, Linus Chua  To contact Bloomberg News staff of this story:
