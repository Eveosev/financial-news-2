  Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO)  is shipping
Western Canada Select oil by barge to its Garyville refinery in
Louisiana, Gary Heminger, a vice president at the company, said
at a conference.  “Through our proprietary barge system we are taking a
steady diet of feedstock,” from Wood River in  Illinois  to
Garyville, said Heminger during a Bank of American Merrill Lynch
refining conference.  The Garyville plant has a capacity of 460,000 barrels a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The discount for Western Canada Select versus the U.S.
benchmark West Texas Intermediate was unchanged at $20.50 a
barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
