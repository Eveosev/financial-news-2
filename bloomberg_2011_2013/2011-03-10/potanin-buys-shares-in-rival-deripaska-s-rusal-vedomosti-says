Russian billionaire  Vladimir
Potanin  said he bought shares in United Co. Rusal on the market
“when they fell,” Vedomosti reported.   The investment wasn’t “big,” Potanin told the Moscow-
based newspaper in an interview published today.   Potanin and billionaire United Co. Rusal Chief Executive
Officer  Oleg Deripaska  are locked in a dispute over the
management of OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, the world’s largest
producer of the metal. Rusal, which owns 25 percent percent of
Norilsk versus Potanin’s 30 percent, rejected a $12.8 billion
cash buyout offer from Norilsk for its stake last week.   To contact the reporter on this story:
