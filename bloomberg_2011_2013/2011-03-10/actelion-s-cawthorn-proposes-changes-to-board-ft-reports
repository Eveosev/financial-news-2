  Actelion Ltd. (ATLN)  Chairman Robert Cawthorn said the company plans to make changes to its board and
senior management structure, amid calls from hedge fund Elliott
Advisers for Cawthorn to resign and for the company to consider
selling itself, the Financial Times reported, citing an
interview.  While Chief Executive Officer Jean-Paul Clozel’s position
is secure, the changes could affect senior management as the
company seeks to ensure it is “appropriate” to the size and
future growth of the company, Cawthorn said, according to the
newspaper. The moves could include the appointment of a chief
operating officer, Cawthorn said, according to the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
