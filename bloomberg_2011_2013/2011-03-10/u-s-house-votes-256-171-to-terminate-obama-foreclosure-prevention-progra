The U.S. House voted 256-171 along
party lines to cancel a fledgling Obama administration program
designed to help homeowners lower monthly mortgage payments.  The vote on the legislation, sponsored by Representative
Robert Dold of  Illinois , is the first of four measures from  House Republicans  to cut spending on housing programs they have
been criticized as ineffective. The House bills would need to
clear the Democrat-controlled Senate and President  Barack Obama ,
who has promised to veto any attempts to kill the programs.  The Federal Housing Administration Short Refi Option
program rejected today is tailored for borrowers whose home
values have dropped below the amount still owed on the mortgage.
If lenders volunteer to write down at least 10 percent of a
loanâ€™s principal, the FHA refinances the remaining debt, often
at a lower rate.  Forty-four loans have been modified under the program since
it began in September, according to the FHA. The housing agency
can draw as much as $8 billion from the $700 billion Troubled
Asset Relief Fund, or TARP, to pay off any loans that default.  Because no borrowers have defaulted, the program has cost
nothing so far, according to the FHA. Participants in the
program have healthy credit scores averaging 711, according to
the FHA. The median consumer credit score last year was about
720, according to Minneapolis-based Fair, Isaac & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
