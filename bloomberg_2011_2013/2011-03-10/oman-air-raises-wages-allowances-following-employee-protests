Oman Air , the sultanate’s state-
owned carrier, said it will increase wages and personal-cost
allowances this month following demonstrations outside the
airline’s headquarters in the past week.  A committee will be created to oversee promotions and look
into disputes, and health insurance policy will reviewed, the
carrier, based in  Oman ’s capital of Muscat, said today in an e-
mailed statement. A meeting will be held on March 15 to update
employees on progress made, it said.  Workers staged an initial protest rally on March 6. A
larger demonstration of more than 200 people that took place on
March 8 marked the end of the protests, Usama Karim Al-Haremi,
an airline spokesman, said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
