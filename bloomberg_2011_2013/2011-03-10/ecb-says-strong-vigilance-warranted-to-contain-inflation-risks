The  European Central Bank  said
“strong vigilance” is warranted to contain inflation,
signaling it may raise  interest rates  next month.  “The Governing Council remains prepared to act in a firm
and timely manner to ensure that upside risks to  price stability 
over the medium term do not materialize,” the Frankfurt-based
ECB said in its monthly bulletin today, echoing President Jean- Claude Trichet’s March 3 policy statement. “It is essential
that the recent rise in inflation does not give rise to broad-
based inflationary pressures over the medium term.”  Euro-area inflation accelerated to 2.4 percent last month
and has been in breach of the ECB’s 2 percent limit since
December. The central bank uses the words “strong vigilance”
to indicate a rate increase is imminent, and Trichet said last
week that policy makers may raise the benchmark rate from a
record low of 1 percent when they convene in April.  Inflation will stay above 2 percent for the whole of 2011,
the ECB said.  Energy inflation will remain at a “high level for some
time,” growth in food prices is “set to accelerate further in
the coming months” and indirect tax increases will “continue
to exert upside pressure” on consumer prices, it said.  “It is essential that the recent rise in inflation does
not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures over the
medium term.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
