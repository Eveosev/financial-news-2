Soccer ruling body FIFA will defer
for more than a year a decision on whether to cap player agents’
pay at 3 percent of transfer fees as the European Commission
plans talks on the subject.  FIFA included the proposal in draft regulations sent to
teams late last year. In an e-mail, the Zurich-based authority
said executives decided this week to hold talks with soccer
clubs and players before members vote on new agent rules in May
2012.  Soccer is seeking to better regulate an industry that
generates some 200 million euros ($276.8 million) a year and
brings the risk of  money laundering , according to a  2009 study 
for the European Commission.  Capping agent fees is illegal under  European Union law ,
according to Roberto Branco Martins, general manager of the
 European Football Agents Association , which represents 1,100
agents. Gianluca Monte, a policy officer in the European
Commission’s sports unit, said he couldn’t comment on the
legality of a cap.  “We’re waiting for this draft regulation to become public
and then we’ll be planning a conference with FIFA and other
stakeholders” in soccer later this year, Monte said by
telephone from Brussels.  Under its draft regulation, FIFA would cap payments to
agents for negotiating a transfer to 3 percent of the fee or a
maximum of 2 million euros. FIFA said it may also require
agents’ fees to be made public and transfer the registration of
agents to national soccer federations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
