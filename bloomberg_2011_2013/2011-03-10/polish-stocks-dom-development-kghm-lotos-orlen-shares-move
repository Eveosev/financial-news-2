Poland’s WIG20 Index declined for a
second day, losing 10.52, or 0.4 percent, to 2,769.75 at 3:07
p.m. in Warsaw.  The following are among the most active stocks on the  Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.    Astarta Holding NV (AST)   sank 7.1 zloty, or 8 percent,
to 82.2 zloty in Warsaw trading, heading for the lowest close
since December. Chairman Valery Korotkov’s Aluxes Holding
Limited sold 1.5 million shares in the Ukrainian sugar producer,
lowering its stake to 26 percent.    KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , Poland’s sole copper
producer, lost 4.3 zloty, or 2.5 percent, to 171.5 zloty,
falling for a fifth day. Copper fell to the lowest price since
December in  London  as imports of the metal into China, the
world’s biggest consumer, slid to a two-year low.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN PW), Poland’s biggest oil company, fell
0.46 zloty, or 0.9 percent, to 49.74 zloty.  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)  , the second-largest refiner, declined 0.97 zloty, or 2.3
percent, to 42.02 zloty. Oil in  New York  fell the most in a
month after Spain’s credit rating was cut and Chinese export
growth slowed, bolstering concern that the global economic
recovery and fuel-demand growth will slow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
