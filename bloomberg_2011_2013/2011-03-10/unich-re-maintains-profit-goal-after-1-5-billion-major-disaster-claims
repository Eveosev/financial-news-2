  Munich Re , the world’s biggest
reinsurer, reiterated its full-year profit target after natural
catastrophes in the first quarter including the earthquake in  New Zealand  cost it about A$1.5 billion ($1.5 billion).  The quake in Christchurch last month cost the Munich-based
reinsurer about A$1 billion in claims, it said in a  statement 
today. Munich Re maintained its full-year profit target of about
2.4 billion euros ($3.3 billion), adding that the goal “will
only remain achievable, if random losses in the further course
of the year remain below expectations.” The shares dropped 2.3
percent to 115.65 euros as of 9:20 a.m. in Frankfurt trading.  Insurers’ losses from the quake that hit New Zealand’s
South Island city of Christchurch on Feb. 22 may reach $6
billion to $12 billion, according to Swiss Reinsurance Co., the
second-largest reinsurer, which estimated its own claims burden
at about $800 million.  Hannover Re , the third biggest, projected
its costs at 150 million euros. Reinsurers help primary carriers
such as Allianz SE shoulder risks for clients.  “Some investors may be disappointed by the size of the
first-quarter claims but it’s no news that Munich Re has a high
market share in the region,” said Thomas Noack, a Dusseldorf,
Germany-based analyst with WestLB AG. “While the 2011 profit
target has become more ambitious, the 2012 target is also rather
cautious.”  Target for 2012  Munich Re, led by Chief Executive Officer Nikolaus von Bomhard, today said it anticipates profit next year at “around
the same level” as the 2011 target. The company said on Feb. 3
that it plans to pay a higher dividend for 2010 and will
continue with share buybacks after full-year net income before
minority interests, the basis for its profit targets, fell 5.2
percent to 2.43 billion euros.  The reinsurer today reiterated plans to buy back as much as
1 billion euros of its own stock before the annual  shareholders’
meeting  in April and a further 500 million-euro buyback by the
2012 assembly.  Munich Re’s claims burden from Cyclone Yasi, which tore
through sugar- and banana-producing areas in Queensland,  Australia , last month, is estimated at about A$135 million,
while the floods that inundated Australia’s Brisbane region may
cost the company about A$350 million, it said.  Last year, losses from natural catastrophes amounted to
about 1.56 billion euros at Munich Re. The February earthquake
in  Chile  was its most costly disaster in 2010 with an overall
burden of almost $1 billion after retrocession and before tax.
Reinsurers limit their own risks by selling parts of them to
other reinsurers in a process known as retrocession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
