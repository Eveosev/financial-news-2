Torm A/S,  Europe ’s largest publicly
traded gasoline and jet fuel tanker company, said it will lose
money for a third straight year in 2011 after securing less
employment for its vessels.  Torm will have a loss before tax of between $100 million
and $125 million, compared with a loss of $136 million in 2010,
the Hellerup-based company said today in a statement to the
Copenhagen stock exchange.  The shipping company said that 16 percent of this year’s
tanker earning days have secured charters at an average rate of
$16,103 a day. A year ago, it had secured 31 percent of 2010’s
earnings days at a rate of $18,989 a day.  The Baltic Clean Tanker Index, a measure of charter rates
for oil-products tankers, has averaged 773 points so far this
year, down from an average of 896 points for all of 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
