Coffee exports from Uganda,  Africa ’s second-biggest grower of the crop, will probably fall
18 percent this month after a drought cut yields, the  Uganda
Coffee Development Authority  said.  Shipments may fall to 180,000 60-kilogram (132-pound) bags,
from 219,684 bags a year earlier, the agency said in an e-mailed
statement today. “The dry spell is to blame,” it said.  The forecast is 7.2 percent less than the 193,965 bags
shipped in February, the authority said. East Africa’s third-
largest economy has experienced a dry spell since December,
which the government blames on  climate change . More than 95
percent of Uganda’s crop is grown by small-scale farmers whose
crop is predominantly rain-fed, according to the authority.  On Sept. 20  Uganda ’s Coffee Development Authority forecast
that exports in the 12 months through September would climb 16
percent to 3.1 million bags. Exports from the start of the
season on Oct. 1 through February declined 7.6 percent to 1.1
million bags, according to calculations by Bloomberg.  Uganda is Africa’s largest coffee producer after  Ethiopia .
The East African nation, where production has fallen from 4.4
million bags in 1996-97 partly because of crop damage caused by
coffee wilt disease, plans to boost output to 4.5 million bags a
season by 2015 through an ongoing replanting program.  Uganda earned $243.6 million from the sales of the beans
last season, down from $291.3 million a year earlier. Robusta
accounts for about 85 percent of annual output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
