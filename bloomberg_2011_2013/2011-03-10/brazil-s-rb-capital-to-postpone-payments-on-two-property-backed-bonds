RB Capital Securitizadora SA, a Sao
Paulo-based firm that issues mortgage-backed bonds, will
postpone a payment on two local securities because of currency
exchange delays caused by  Brazil ’s Carnaval holiday, said
Marcelo Michalua, a partner at RB.  RB Capital didn’t make the payment on the bonds because the
delays in international money transfers prevented Celestica do
Brasil Ltda, the manufacturer whose real-estate receivables back
the securities, from turning the funds over on time, Michalua
said. He said he expects the payment to be made today.  “We don’t see this as a credit problem,” Michalua said in
a telephone interview from his Sao Paulo office. “This is a
multinational company and they have assured us that the payment
will be made today. This should be resolved very soon.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
