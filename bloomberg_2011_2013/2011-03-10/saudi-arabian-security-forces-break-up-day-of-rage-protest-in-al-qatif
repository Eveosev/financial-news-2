  Saudi Arabia  said its security
forces broke up a protest in the eastern city of al-Qatif, a day
before what anti-government demonstrators have called a “Day of
Rage.”  Police fired above the crowd of 120-150 people to break up
the gathering after a policeman taking video to document the
event was attacked, Major General Mansour al-Turki, an Interior
Ministry spokesman, said in an interview. Three people were
injured, two protesters and one policeman, he said.  Some people are trying to “instigate chaos,” he said in
a telephone interview.  Regional unrest, which has so far toppled the leaders of
Tunisia and Egypt, has reached Saudi Arabia’s neighbors Yemen,
Oman and Bahrain, the island-kingdom where a Sunni family rules
the majority Shiite population. In  Libya ,  Muammar Qaddafi  is
fighting rebels who seek to end his four-decade rule.  Crude oil for April delivery declined $1.45, or 1.4
percent, to $102.93 a barrel at 2:21 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices are up 25 percent from a year ago.
Oil traded at about $101.50 before reports of the gunfire.  U.S. officials said Saudi authorities used “less-than-
lethal” means on protesters, CNBC said, without naming the
officials. The security forces fired rubber bullets, CNBC
reported.  Protests are outlawed in the kingdom, whose ruling family
applies a strict version of Sunni Islam. Shiites are a minority
in the country.  Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal said yesterday his
government believes dialogue is the best way to solve problems
in the kingdom.  To contact the reporter on this story:
