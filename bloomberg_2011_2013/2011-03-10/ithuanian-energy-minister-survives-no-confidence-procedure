Lithuanian Energy Minister Arvydas Sekmokas survived a no-confidence motion in parliament called
after a failed tender to find an investor to build a nuclear
power plant in the Baltic nation.  Lawmakers today voted 66 to 53, with 9 abstentions, to
reject the opposition-led procedure, according to a count of the
ballots on the Vilnius-based parliamentâ€™s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
