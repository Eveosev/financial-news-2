Norway’s inflation accelerated in
February from the lowest level since 2006, as rising commodity
prices push up costs across the Nordic economy.  Underlying inflation, which excludes energy costs and
taxes, accelerated to 0.8 percent from 0.7 percent the previous
month,  Statistics Norway  said in a statement on its website
today. The rate was expected to rise to 0.9 percent, according
to the median estimate of nine economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
Underlying inflation remained below the central bank’s 2.5
percent target for a 19th month. Headline inflation eased to 1.2
percent from 2 percent, the office said. Headline prices rose
0.4 percent in the month, after falling 0.5 percent in January.  “This year some of the retail chains have warned about
substantial price hikes, much due to the recent surge in
international food prices,” Shakeb Syed, economist at Svenska
Handelsbanken AB in Oslo said in a note to clients before the
release of the data. “Consequently, we expect food prices to
pick up noticeably.”  Record food prices will probably be sustained this year
amid high crude oil costs and smaller crops, the United Nations
Food & Agriculture Organization said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
