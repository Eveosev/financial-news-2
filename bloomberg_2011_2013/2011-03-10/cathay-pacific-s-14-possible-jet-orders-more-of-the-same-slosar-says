  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293) , with
91 widebody planes on order, may buy as many as 14 more similar
aircraft to take advantage of China travel growth.  The possible orders are “pretty likely to be more of the
same,” incoming Chief Executive Officer John Slosar said today
in a Bloomberg TV interview in Hong Kong. “In a high-oil price
environment, you want the most efficient aircraft.”  The Hong Kong-based carrier yesterday ordered 15 Airbus SAS
A330-300s and 10  Boeing Co. (BA)  777-300ERs, expanding a backlog that
also includes A350-900s, to boost operations and replace older
planes. The airline also said it almost tripled profit last year
as economic growth boosts passenger and cargo traffic in  China .  “Strong operating performance, access to China growth and
protectiveness of home base are Cathay’s key competitive
advantages,” Sam Lee and Hung Bin Toh, analysts at Credit
Suisse Group AG, said in a note to clients. The record profit
“demonstrated its efficiency and pricing power.”  The analysts raised their target price to HK$23.50 from
HK$22.00 and reiterated an “outperform” rating.  The airline fell 2.5 percent to HK$18.46 at the close of
trading in Hong Kong. It has jumped 21 percent in the past year,
surpassing the benchmark  Hang Seng Index ’s 11 percent gain.  Cathay has no immediate plans to order Airbus’s A380, the
world’s last passenger plane, Slosar said. In August, the
carrier ordered 30 A350-900s and six 777-300ERs. It also
yesterday announced plans to lease a further two A350-900s.  Cathay, Dragonair  The new planes will predominately join the mainline Cathay
Pacific fleet, Slosar said. Unit  Hong Kong  Dragon Airlines Ltd.
will get some of Cathay’s existing planes and some new ones, he
said.  Dragonair may add a couple more routes in mainland China,
Slosar said, without elaboration. The unit has already returned
operations to about the same levels they were at before cuts
were made during the global recession, he said.  Cathay, the world’s largest international air-cargo carrier,
is also forming a venture with affiliate  Air China Ltd. (601111)  to add
freight hubs in Shanghai and Beijing. Operations may begin soon
after delays in getting final approvals from government
officials, Slosar said.  “We’re very confident that there’s not going to be any
problems,” he said. “It’s just a matter of a little more
time.”  Plane Deliveries  All 91 of the on-order planes, which includes leased ones,
will be delivered by 2019. The carrier will retire its 21 747s
and 11 A340s by the end of the decade, it said yesterday. The
airline may also return some on-lease A330s, Slosar said.  The airline’s second-half yield improvement surpassed
regional rivals and operating margin excluding fuel hedging was
better than  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA) ’s, Credit Suisse said.  “Cathay’s operations improved dramatically, and it
demonstrated good revenue and yield management,” the analysts
said.  The airline’s net income last year jumped to HK$14 billion
($1.8 billion) from HK$4.7 billion a year earlier. The figure
was boosted by one-time gains following the sale of stakes in
ventures.  Full-year passenger numbers, including at Dragonair, jumped
9.1 percent to 26.8 million as business and leisure travelers
resumed flying because of the global economic pickup. Yields, a
measure of average fares, rose 20 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
