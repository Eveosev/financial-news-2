  Germany ’s eastern states can
continue to tap European Union structural aid after the current
arrangements expire in 2013, EU Commissioner for Regional Policy
Johannes Hahn told the  Financial Times Deutschland .  The European Commission is studying post-2013 aid options
for five states, excluding Berlin, that may qualify for reduced
assistance as their economic competitiveness grows, Hahn was
cited as saying by the newspaper. Germany helps the states
directly with a “solidarity surcharge” on income tax that will
expire in 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
