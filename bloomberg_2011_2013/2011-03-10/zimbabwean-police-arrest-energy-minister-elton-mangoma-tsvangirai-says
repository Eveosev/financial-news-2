Zimbabwean police arrested Energy
and Power Development Minister Elton Mangoma, Prime Minister
Morgan Tsvangirai said.  Tsvangirai, speaking today during a meeting with business
executives in Harare, the capital, said he was unaware of the
circumstances of the arrest.  Mangoma, a senior official in Tsvangirai’s  Movement for
Democratic Change  party, has faced accusations in the state-
controlled media that he awarded a fuel-supply contract to a
South African company without going through a tender process.  “Honorable Elton Mangoma was this morning picked up by
three plain clothes police officers” at his office, the MDC said
in a statement. “The reasons for his arrest are not clear.”  Police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena couldn’t immediately
comment on the arrest, saying by phone, “I don’t have details on
that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
