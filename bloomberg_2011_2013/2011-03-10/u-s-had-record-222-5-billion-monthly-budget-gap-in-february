The U.S. government, facing a
record annual fiscal shortfall and a congressional impasse over
financing, posted the largest monthly deficit ever in February,
reflecting increased spending.  The gap totaled $222.5 billion last month compared with a
$220.9 billion shortfall in February 2010, according to the
 Treasury Department ’s monthly budget statement released today in  Washington . Last February’s deficit was the previous monthly
record, government data show.  The deficit threatens to eventually push borrowing costs
higher and curb economic growth,  Federal Reserve  Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told lawmakers last week. Members of Congress are at
odds over plans to reduce the shortfall, cut taxes and preserve
entitlement programs, such as Medicare and the Obama
administration’s health-care overhaul.  “People in Congress seem much more interested in yelling
at each other instead of fixing the problem,” said  David Wyss ,
chief economist at  Standard & Poor’s  in New York. “Bluntly,
there is no way out of this unless you cut spending, raise taxes
or some combination of the two.”  Congress approved a temporary budget March 2 to prevent a
government shutdown while lawmakers negotiate Republican demands
to further cut spending. The House last month approved a
Republican plan to cut $61 billion from 2011  government
spending , which would translate into mean reductions of 10
percent or more in hundreds of programs.  $1.5 Trillion  This year’s budget deficit is projected to reach $1.5
trillion, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate
released Jan. 26. The previous record, $1.4 trillion, was
in fiscal 2009.  For the fiscal year to date, the deficit totaled $641.3
billion, compared with $651.6 billion the prior fiscal year to
date, according to the Treasury’s data.  “The long-term unsustainability of our debt is a
significant problem because it threatens higher  interest rates ,
less confidence, and it could have impact on the current
recovery,” Bernanke said in response to a question from the
Senate Banking Committee on March 1.  So far, the growing deficit hasn’t dissuaded investors from
buying U.S. government securities.  Treasuries extended gains after the government sold $13
billion of 30-year bonds, the final of three note and bond
auctions this week totaling $66 billion. The 30-year bond yield
dropped 10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage point, to 4.51
percent at 4:04 p.m. in  New York .  Survey of Economists  Before today’s budget report, a survey of economists by
Bloomberg News anticipated a deficit of $225.2 billion in
February. The survey included 26 estimates, with forecasts
ranging from $190 billion to $243.6 billion. The non-partisan
CBO, in a forecast issued March 7, estimated the February budget
deficit would total $223 billion.  The Treasury’s report today showed that government spending
rose 1.4 percent in February to $333.2 billion and revenue and
other fees increased 2.9 percent to $110.7 billion.  Individual income tax receipts rose 26.6 percent to $422.8
billion on a fiscal year-to-date basis. Corporate income tax
receipts fell 15.9 percent on a fiscal year-to-date basis,
according to the data.  Government debt has risen to 62.1 percent of gross domestic
product over the past decade from 34.7 percent, according to a
Bloomberg Government survey released March 7. The study
projected debt will reach 84.9 percent of GDP by 2020 and
forecasts the government will spend $44.5 trillion from 2011
through 2020, requiring $10.4 trillion in additional borrowing.  ‘Painful Steps’  “Regretfully, I think that the politicians will only take
the necessary, painful steps if forced to do so by a crisis,”
said  Ward McCarthy , chief financial economist at Jeffries & Co.
Inc. in New York, before today’s report. “We got here because
politicians have been willing to mortgage the future with
unfunded liabilities for current political gain.”  The Treasury lowered its estimate for borrowing from
January through March as it scales back on bill sales behalf of
the Federal Reserve. Borrowing will total a net $237 billion in
the current quarter, the Treasury announced Jan. 31. In the
quarter ended Dec. 31, the Treasury borrowed $363 billion.  To grapple with the debt, a committee of Wall Street bond
dealers and investors that advises the Treasury recommended the
government expand its domestic demand and offer new securities,
including “ultra-long” bonds of as much as 100 years, to
reduce dependence on foreign holders.  China  is the largest
foreign holder of  U.S. government debt , followed by Japan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
