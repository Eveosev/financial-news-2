U.S. stock futures extended losses,
signaling the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may fall for a second
day, as jobless claims and the trade deficit increased more than
forecast.    Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
March retreated 0.5 percent to 1,308.9 at 8:34 a.m. in  New York .
Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 0.4 percent to 12,125,
while Nasdaq-100 Index futures lost 0.5 percent to 2,298.75.    Applications for first-time  unemployment benefits  increased
by 26,000 to 397,000 in the week ended March 5, Labor Department
figures showed. Economists forecast claims would climb to
376,000, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey. The total number of people receiving benefits in the
prior week fell to the lowest since October 2008.    The trade deficit increased 15 percent to $46.3 billion,
from $40.3 billion in December, Commerce Department
figures showed today in  Washington , as a surge in imports led by
costlier oil overshadowed record exports.  The  S&P 500  has fallen 1.7 percent since this year’s high
on Feb. 18 as crude oil surged amid unrest in North Africa and
the Middle East. The measure has still rallied 95 percent since
reaching a 12-year low in March 2009.  Earlier losses in futures came as export growth slowed in  China  and Moody’s Investors Service cut Spain’s credit rating,
increasing concern that the global economic recovery may falter.  China Deficit  China reported an unexpected $7.3 billion trade deficit,
the biggest in seven years, as the nation’s exports rose at the
slowest pace since November 2009. German exports had a surprise
decline in January after gaining in the previous two months, the
Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said today.    Spain ’s rating was downgraded to Aa2 by Moody’s, which said
that the cost of supporting the country’s banks will exceed the
government’s estimates. The ratings company has a negative
outlook on the country’s debt.  Only one American in seven has faith a lasting economic
recovery has taken hold and a plurality say they are personally
worse off than they were two years ago, according to a Bloomberg
National Poll conducted March 4-7. Almost half of the
respondents believe the U.S. is in a “fragile” rebound and
could fall back into recession and more than a third of the
country believes the U.S. never emerged from recession.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
