The euro fell to the lowest level
in a week against the dollar after Moody’s Investors Service
lowered  Spain ’s credit rating, increasing pressure on European
leaders to find a solution to the region’s debt crisis.  The shared currency weakened against most of its major
peers as Spanish debt was downgraded to Aa2 by Moody’s and the
Bank of Spain named banks that require more capital. Currencies
of commodity-exporting countries weakened after China reported
an unexpected trade deficit and crude  oil prices  fell. The pound
stayed lower versus the greenback after the Bank of England left
interest rates at a record low.  “The euro seems to be under pressure given the downgrade
from Moody’s,” said Mary Nicola, a currency strategist at BNP
Paribas SA in New York. “Weaker-than-expected trade data out of  China  and  Germany , all of those are putting pressure on the
euro.”  The euro declined 0.8 percent to $1.3798 as of 5 p.m. in
New York, from $1.3909 yesterday. It touched $1.3775, the least
since March 2. The dollar strengthened 0.3 percent to 82.98 yen
from 82.74 yen.  InterContinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index, which tracks
the greenback against the currencies of six major trading
partners, rose 0.7 percent to 77.265, after touching the highest
level since Feb. 28.  Refuge Demand  Demand for higher-yielding assets dropped, spurring a sell-
off in stocks and prompting investors to seek haven in  U.S.
Treasuries . The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 1.9 percent and
the yield on 10-year notes slumped 11 basis points to 3.36
percent.  The Swiss franc rose against most of its major
counterparts, adding 0.5 percent against the euro to 1.2860. The
yen advanced 0.5 percent to 114.49 per euro.    Europe ’s common currency has lost 1.2 percent against the
dollar since climbing to a four-month high on March 7.  German exports unexpectedly declined 1.2 percent in January
after gaining in the previous two months, the Federal Statistics
Office in Wiesbaden said today.  European leaders are due to meet tomorrow having set a
March 25 deadline to approve a “comprehensive” package of
measures to end the sovereign-debt crisis. Moody’s said the
outlook for the Spanish rating is “negative,” meaning the next
change is most likely to be another cut.  Trichet Watch  ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said last week “strong
vigilance” is warranted to contain inflation, signaling the
central bank may raise interest rates next month for the first
time since 2008.  The Bank of Spain said 12 lenders need to raise 15.2
billion euros ($21 billion) to meet revised minimum capital
levels or risk partial nationalization. The banks include the
Spanish units of Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays Plc, and eight
cajas, or savings banks. The lenders have until September to
meet core  capital requirements .  The  Bank of England ’s decision to leave its benchmark
interest rate at 0.5 percent was predicted by all 61 economists
in a Bloomberg survey. The central bank also maintained its
asset-purchase program at 200 billion pounds ($323 billion).  Pound View  “A near-term hike by the BOE is priced in,”  Geoffrey Yu ,
a currency strategist at UBS AG in  London  said in a Bloomberg
interview conducted yesterday. “If they signal further
hawkishness, then maybe sterling will continue to rally.”  The pound weakened 0.9 percent to $1.6061 from 1.6203
yesterday.  China reported a $7.3 billion trade deficit, the biggest in
seven years, spurring concern the world’s second-biggest economy
is slowing. Currencies linked to commodities dropped versus the
greenback.  The yuan traded at 6.5735 per dollar, from 6.5724
yesterday.  “It’s a broader risk-off move. It’s a reversal of what had
rallied the most,” said  Greg Anderson , a currency strategist at
Citigroup Inc. in New York. “The euro is outperforming the
Aussie, Swedish krona and Norwegian krone.”  Crude oil fell 1.7 percent to $102.61 a barrel in New York.
Prices climbed 0.7 percent earlier, as fighting in Libya shut
the nation’s biggest oil refinery.  Oil Reaction  Norway’s krone fell the most versus the dollar, dropping
1.5 percent to $5.6558. The Canadian dollar weakened 0.8 percent
to 97.60 cents per dollar.    Australia ’s statistics bureau said employment fell by
10,100 in February from the previous month. That compares with
the median forecast for a 20,000 increase in a Bloomberg survey.  The  Reserve Bank  of Australia will increase interest rates
by 27 basis points during the next 12 months, down from 29 basis
points yesterday, according to a Credit Suisse AG index based on
overnight swaps.  The  New Zealand dollar  was close to the weakest level in
five months after the nation’s central bank cut the benchmark
interest rate to match a record low to help the economy recover
from the deadliest earthquake in 80 years.  Australia’s currency sank to $1.0008 from $1.0108 in New
York, after touching 99.91 cents, the weakest since Feb. 23.  New
Zealand ’s dollar was at 73.54 U.S. cents from 73.66 yesterday,
when it touched 73.23 cents, the lowest since Sept. 30.  To contact the reporter for this story:
