  Cap SA (CAP) , Chile’s largest steel
producer and iron miner, fell to the lowest in six months as
Chinese imports of ore slumped, signaling reduced demand.  The shares sank 3.8 percent in Santiago trading to 21,360
pesos, the lowest price since Sept. 1, at 3 p.m. New York time.  Falling commodity prices, a cut to  Spain ’s credit rating by
Moody’s Investors Service and increased U.S. jobless claims also
contributed to Cap’s decline, said Juan Jose Ponce, an analyst
at brokerage Larrain Vial in Santiago.  “The majority of Cap’s sales are for export, so the news
out of  China  hit them hard,” Ponce said. “This move was a
correction related to the falling price of iron, and had
everything to do with what’s happening outside of the country.”  China’s imports of  iron ore , the steelmaking ingredient,
fell 29 percent last month from the January record as a five-day
national holiday and steeper prices weakened demand. China
copper imports tumbled 35 percent in February to the lowest
level in more than two years. China is the world’s largest
copper consumer.  Applications for first-time  unemployment benefits  in the
U.S. increased by 26,000 to 397,000 in the week ended March 5,
Labor Department figures showed, a sign unemployment isn’t yet
under control in the world’s largest economy. Moody’s cut
Spain’s rating by one level to Aa2, saying the government
underestimated the cost of shoring up its banking industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
