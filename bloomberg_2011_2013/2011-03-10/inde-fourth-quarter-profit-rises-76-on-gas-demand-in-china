  Linde AG (LIN) , the world’s second-
biggest maker of industrial gases, posted fourth-quarter profit
that beat analysts’ estimates, boosted by sales to the health-
care industry and growth in  China  and  India .  Net income increased to 307 million euros ($425 million)
from 174 million euros a year earlier, the Munich-based company
said today in a statement. Sales rose about 20 percent to 3.46
billion euros. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had estimated net
income of 243.5 million euros on sales of 3.28 billion euros.  Linde and larger competitor  Air Liquide SA (AI)  both forecast
increasing earnings and revenue this year as rebounding global
economies raise demand for industrial gases used by steelmakers
and pharmaceutical companies. Linde created a new board position
to manage its growing Asian business, appointing Sanjiv Lamba,
currently the Singapore-based head of Linde’s Southeast Asia
operations, to the post.  “The biggest contributor to growth was the Asia/Eastern  Europe  region,” Stephan Kippe, an analyst at Commerzbank AG
with an “add” rating on the stock, said in a note to
investors. “Clean top-line growth in the gases segment has
continued at the same pace in the fourth quarter. We consider
this a strong sign for general demand momentum.”  Linde rose as much as 2.1 percent to 115 euros and were
unchanged at 112.65 euros as of 1:05 p.m. in Frankfurt trading,
even as the benchmark DAX index fell. The stock has dropped 0.8
percent this year, giving the company a market value of 19.2
billion euros. Shares of Paris-based Air Liquide have also
declined 0.8 percent this year.  Earnings Targets  Profitability targets that Linde set for 2014 include
operating profit totaling at least 4 billion euros and return on
capital employed of at least 14 percent. That represents a 37
percent increase in operating profit over four years and a gain
in ROCE of 1.5 percentage points.  Revenue will be boosted by growth at the gases unit, with
sales from gases used in health care accelerating this year,
Linde said. In plant construction, sales probably won’t grow,
the company said.  Full-year sales growth at the gases division was led by a
22 percent jump at Linde’s Asian and eastern European division,
with operating profit rising 20 percent. The company may hire
8,000 to 10,000 workers in  Asia  by 2020, Chief Executive Officer
Wolfgang Reitzle said at a press conference today in Munich.  Industrial production in  Germany , Europe’s largest economy,
rose more than analysts had expected in January as construction
rebounded. Output increased 1.8 percent from December, the
Economy Ministry in Berlin said yesterday, faster than the 1.7
percent forecast by economists.  Linde’s cost-savings program yielded 160 million euros last
year and 200 million euros in 2009, Reitzle said today. The
company plans total savings of as much as 800 million euros by
the end of 2012 by reducing purchasing expenses, integrating
information technology systems and making its supply chain more
efficient.  The German company plans to pay an annual dividend of 2.20
euros per share, compared with 1.80 euros per share the year
before, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
