German  government bonds  rose after
Moody’s Investors Service downgraded  Spain ’s credit rating,
prompting investors to favor the relative safety of assets from
less indebted European nations.  The yield premium investors demand to hold 10-year Spanish
bonds instead of benchmark German bunds widened for a third day
after Moody’s cut Spain one step to Aa2 and said it may make
further downgrades, citing costs to shore up the nation’s banks.
Bunds rose for a second day after a report showed German exports
unexpectedly fell in January, while two-year Greek yields jumped
to the highest since May.  “The Moody’s downgrade for Spain is likely to trigger some
more demand for bunds,” said  Kornelius Purps , an interest-rate
strategist at UniCredit SpA in Munich. “We are still in a
negative ratings drift.”  The yield on the 10-year bund,  Europe ’s benchmark
government security, was four basis points lower are
3.25 percent as of 4:43 p.m. in London. The 2.5 percent security
due January 2021 rose 0.34, or 3.40 euros per 1,000-euro
($1,384) face amount, to 93.79. Two-year note yields fell three
basis points to 1.7 percent.  Concern that Europe’s most indebted nations will be unable
to make bond repayments has driven borrowing costs for so-called
peripheral nations to record highs. The yield on  Portugal ’s 10-
year bond surged yesterday to the most since before the euro
made its debut in 1999, while Italian debt costs reached
5 percent for the first time in more than two years.  Portuguese Record  Italian 10-year yields declined two basis points to 4.97
percent after a government report showed the nation’s industrial
output unexpectedly fell in January, a sign that recovery in the
euro region’s third-biggest economy is losing pace. China
reported a $7.3 billion trade deficit as export growth in the
world’s fastest-growing major economy slumped in February, a
separate report showed.  Spanish 10-year bonds reversed losses after Treasury
Director Soledad Nunez said borrowing costs are within budgeted
levels. Yields were little changed at 5.51 percent following a
rise to as much as 5.55 percent, the highest since Jan. 11. The
yield difference, or spread, with benchmark German bunds widened
to as much as 231 basis points, the most since Jan. 31, before
trading four basis points higher at 226 basis points. Two-year
Spanish yields declined four basis points to 3.22 percent.  ‘Event Risk’  Government leaders from the 17-nation euro area are due to
meet tomorrow evening in Brussels to discuss a competitiveness
pact that the Germans say should be part of an overall package
of measures to tackle the debt crisis. A final deal is due
March 24-25.  “There is a major event risk tomorrow and the market has
already discounted that they will not come up with something
firm,” said Niels From, chief analyst at Nordea Bank AB in
Copenhagen. “There’s just a pause at the moment as the market
waits for more guidance.”  The Bank of Spain said today that the total capital
shortfall for its banking industry is 15.15 billion euros. It’s
“surprising” that Moody’s didn’t wait to see the central
bank’s assessment, Nunez said in a telephone interview in  Madrid 
following the ratings agency’s downgrade. Spain has completed 24
percent of its planned financing through bonds for this year,
she said.  Credit-Default Swaps  The cost of insuring Spain’s bonds rose to the highest this
month, with credit-default swaps on the nation climbing 8 basis
points to 258, according to CMA. Contracts on Portugal increased
8.5 basis points to a two-month high of 505.5, while  Greece  rose
6 basis points to a record 1,040, after jumping 30 percent since
the start of February.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of swaps on 25 European
banks and insurers rose for a fifth day, up 2.5 basis points to
161.5, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Two-year Greek yields jumped as much as 38 basis points to
17.10 percent, the highest since May, as the securities declined
for a ninth day, the longest losing streak since Jan. 7. The
yield on the 2013 bond later eased to 17.01 percent, still 28
basis points higher than yesterday’s close, giving it a premium
of 420 basis points over the rate on 10-year Greek bonds.    Germany ’s budget deficit is estimated to reach 2.7 percent
of gross domestic product for this year, according to the
European Commission’s November forecasts. That compares with
estimated fiscal shortfalls of 10.3 percent for Ireland,
6.4 percent for Spain, 4.9 percent for Portugal and 4.3 percent
for  Italy , the commission data shows.  Italy, Portugal, Finland  The Italian 10-year yield spread over similar maturity
German bunds rose as high as 179 basis points, the most since
Jan. 12, before easing to 173 basis points. Italy is scheduled
to sell as much as 3 billion euros of 3 percent bonds due 2015
and 2 billion euros of 4.5 percent bonds maturing 2026 tomorrow.  Portugal plans to sell between 750 million euros and 1
billion euros of 12-month bills on March 16, debt agency IGCP
said on its website today. Finland raised $2 billion selling
2.25 percent coupon bonds maturing March 2016, the Helsinki-
based Treasury said in a statement today.  Ten-year Finnish yields declined four basis points to 3.46
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
