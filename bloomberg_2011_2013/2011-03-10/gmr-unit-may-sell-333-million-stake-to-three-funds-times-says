  GMR Infrastructure Ltd. (GMRI) , which runs
two airports in  India , may sell a stake in an unlisted group
company to three private equity funds, the Economic Times
reported today, citing people familiar with the matter it didn’t
identify.  The report said that SBI-Macquarie, Standard Chartered
Plc’s private equity arm and an unnamed south Indian bank would
invest almost 15 billion rupees ($333 million) in the company.  Arun Bhagat, head of corporate communications at GMR Group,
did not answer two calls to his mobile phone seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
