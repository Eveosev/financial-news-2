RB Capital Securitizadora SA, a Sao
Paulo-based firm that issues mortgage-backed debt, received a
late bond payment from Celestica do Brasil Ltda, said an
external press official for RB Capital.  Earlier today RB Capital had said that it postponed a
payment on two local bonds because Celestica, the manufacturer
whose real-estate receivables back the securities, didn’t turn
over the money on time.  Brazil ’s Carnaval holiday caused a
currency exchange delay, Marcelo Michalua, a partner at RB, said
in an interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
