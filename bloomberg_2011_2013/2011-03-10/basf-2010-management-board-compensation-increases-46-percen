  BASF SE (BAS) , the world’s biggest
chemical company, paid its eight-member management board a total
of 25.7 million euros ($35.5 million) for 2010 including cash,
bonuses, and options, 46 percent more than for 2009, according
to the company’s  annual report .  Chief Executive Officer Juergen Hambrecht made 5.2 million
euros, 55 percent more than the previous year, while Chief
Financial Officer Kurt Bock, who will take over as CEO from May,
earned 3.9 million euros.  The increase stems from higher variable compensation, with
fixed salaries remaining little changed. Ludwigshafen, Germany-
based BASF reported net income of 4.56 billion euros last year,
more than three times the profit of 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
