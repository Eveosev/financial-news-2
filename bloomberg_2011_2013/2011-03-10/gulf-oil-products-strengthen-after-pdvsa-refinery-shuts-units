Gulf oil products gained after
Petroleos de Venezuela SA said it shut units at the Isla
refinery in Curacao.  Two units, known as distiller-2A and feed preparation-2,
were halted March 7 for maintenance at boiler 3103, Kenneth Gijsbertha, a company spokesman, said yesterday in an e-mailed
response to questions. Caracas-based PDVSA leases the 335,000
barrel-a-day refinery from the Curacao government.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the  Gulf Coast  narrowed 0.88 cent to 16 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:12 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery slipped
3.11 cents to $2.8274 a gallon.  The premium to Nymex heating oil futures for ultra-low-
sulfur diesel rose 0.25 cent to 2.75 cents a gallon. Prompt
delivery fell 4.67 cents to $3.0490.  New York Harbor gasoline slipped as European gasoline
inventories in independent storage increased to an 11-month
high, according to an industry consulting company.  Stockpiles of the motor fuel in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-
Antwerp oil trading hub rose 18 percent to 1.03 million tons in
the week to today, the highest level since April, according to
data from PJK International BV. Inventories are mainly of
summer-quality fuel, said Pieter Kulsen, PJKâ€™s founder.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  New
York  Harbor weakened 1.13 cents to 17.38 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
