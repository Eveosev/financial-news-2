The Wisconsin Assembly voted to
give final passage to a bill curbing collective bargaining for
most government workers that was stalled for weeks when
Democratic senators fled to  Illinois  to prevent a quorum.  The measure, which exempts police and firemen, limits
bargaining to wages, not benefits or working conditions. Unions
would be subject to recertification votes every year, requiring
51 percent of members, not just those voting. Automatic
withdrawals to pay union dues would be prohibited.  Governor  Scott Walker , a 43-year-old first-term Republican,
said the measure would generate $30 million in savings this
fiscal year and $300 million in the next two years. The bill
calls for workers to pay more toward pensions and health
insurance. He said he will sign the measure as soon as he is
able.  “Walker has chosen to take on the people who teach our
kids to read, who plow our roads during blizzards, who help the
sick and infirm live with dignity and who rush into burning
buildings,” Karen Hickey, a Wisconsin AFL-CIO spokeswoman, said
in a statement before vote. “None of these are people who give
up easily.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
