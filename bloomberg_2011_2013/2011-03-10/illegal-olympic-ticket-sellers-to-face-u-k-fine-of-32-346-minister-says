People trying to sell to sell fake
or unauthorized tickets for the  London 2012 Olympics  may be
fined as much as 20,000 pounds ($32,346), U.K. Home Secretary
Theresa May said today.  “The 2012 Games will be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
to experience the Games on home soil,” May said during a visit
to the Olympic Park. The U.K. government has lifted the fine to
20,000 pounds from 5,000 pounds in order to send “a clear
message to criminals and prospective criminals that it is not
worth their while and they are not welcome.”  The London Games officially open on July 27, 2012. About 11
million tickets will go on sale on the London 2012 website,
www.tickets.london2012.com, to the public for a period of six
weeks starting March 15. Instead of “first come, first
served,” tickets will be sold in a ballot, giving every
applicant an equal chance of attending an Olympic event.  The Metropolitan Police has so far made 49 arrests related
to illegally selling Olympics tickets, it said in a an e-mailed
statement today.  The 20,000 pound fine only relates to selling tickets in a
public place or in the course of business, London 2012
organizers said. The organizing committee will be operating an
exchange system for those who want to legitimately sell on
unwanted tickets.  The London 2012 site will have a so-called website checker,
which ticket buyers can use to find out whether a ticket website
is fake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
