  Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ)  fell the most
in nine months after it reported fourth-quarter earnings that
fell short of estimates.  The stock dropped as much as 17 percent to $11.43 a share
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading at 12:41 p.m. New York time, the
largest intra-day percentage drop since June 2.  Canadian Solar reported today earnings of 58 cents a share,
compared to the 64-cent a share average of seven analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Shares of competing solar panel makers also declined. Wuxi,
China-based Suntech Power Holdings Co., the worldâ€™s biggest
solar panel maker, fell 6.65 percent.  San Jose , California-based  SunPower Corp. (SPWRA) , the second largest U.S.-based  panel maker, fell
6.42 percent. Shares of Changzhou, China-based  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL) 
fell 4.53 percent.  The lower earnings were due to the company writing off a $3
million investment and $9.7 million prepayment in a start-up
supplier, it said in a statement.  The Suzhou New District-based company reiterated its
guidance on its manufacturing outlook for 1.2 gigawatts to 1.3
gigawatts of modules for 2011 and expects to reach 200 megawatts
of production capacity at its new plant by mid-year in Ontario,
Canada.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
