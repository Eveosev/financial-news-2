Cemex SAB, the largest cement maker
in the Americas, boosted its convertible-bond sale by as much as
21 percent over what it planned as the company seeks to reduce
bank debt faster.  Cemex will sell as much as $1.67 billion of convertible
bonds, including an over-allotment option granted to managers of
the sale, the company said yesterday in a statement. The action
will help Cemex meet targets to reduce debt under a $15 billion
bank refinancing agreement it negotiated in 2009 to avoid
defaulting on debt. The company said in February it has about
$9.5 billion left under the bank agreement.  “To the extent that they upsized the deal, I think that is
a clear positive for creditors,” said  Christopher Buck , an
analyst with Barclays Bank Plc in New York. “It signals that
the company continues to be aggressive about paying down the
financing agreement and extending maturities.”  Monterrey, Mexico-based Cemex has struggled to reduce
leverage as the global recession cut profit just after it had
borrowed to acquire Sydney-based Rinker Group Ltd. in July 2007
for $14.2 billion. The company said on Feb. 3 it needs to reduce
bank debt by $2.3 billion this year to save about $200 million
in additional interest costs.  Cemex cut debt, including perpetual bonds, to $17.7 billion
at the end of 2010 from $22.3 billion at the end of June 2009.
The company still needs to be profitable to turn around, Buck
said. Cemex has posted net losses in the last five quarters amid
falling cement demand in the U.S. and  Europe .  Near-Term Challenges  “We really need to see volumes returning and earnings
improving,” Buck said. “Our view is this will eventually
happen. But it’s not going to happen right away, and things will
continue to be quite challenging in the near term.”  Cemex will sell $800 million of 3.25 percent convertible
notes due in 2016 and $600 million of 3.75 percent bonds that
mature in 2018, the company said in yesterday’s statement. The
notes will have an initial conversion price equivalent to $11.28
for each American depositary receipt, a 30 percent premium over
yesterday’s close of $8.68.  Cemex said earlier this week it would offer $600 million in
each issue. An over-allotment option granted to the managers of
the sales may increase the amount of 2016 notes by $177.5
million and the 2018 bonds by $90 million, according to the
statement today. That option had earlier been set at $90 million
each.  Offering Managers  The global coordinators for the offerings are the
brokerages of  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , according
to a preliminary prospectus. The joint bookrunners include the
brokerages of  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) ,  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) ,  BNP Paribas (BNP) , Barclays, HSBC Holdings Plc, Banco
Santander SA, ING Groep NV and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  The cement maker said it expects the offerings to close on
March 15. The company plans to pay about $187 million for a cap
on the share-price conversion rate. The cap for the 2016 notes
is at a 90 percent premium to the closing share price on March 9
and 110 percent for the 2018 bonds.  The U.S. shares fell 8 cents to $8.60 at the close of  New
York  Stock Exchange composite trading today. They have dropped
20 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Thomas Black  in Monterrey at
