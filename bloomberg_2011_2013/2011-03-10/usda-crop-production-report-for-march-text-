Following is the text of the U.S.
Crop Production report for March from the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture :  Orange Production Down 1 Percent from January  The United States all orange forecast for the 2010-2011 season is
8.70 million tons, down 1 percent from the January 1 forecast but 6 percent
above the 2009-2010 final utilization. The  Florida  all orange forecast, at
138 million boxes (6.21 million tons), is down 1 percent from the January 1
forecast but 3 percent above last season's final utilization. Early,
midseason, and navel varieties in Florida are forecast at 66.0 million boxes
(2.97 million tons), down 1 percent from January and 4 percent lower than
last season. The Florida Valencia orange forecast, at 72.0 million boxes
(3.24 million tons), is down 1 percent from the previous forecast but up
11 percent from the 2009-2010 crop. Fruit size and droppage are projected to
be below average. California and  Texas  forecasts are carried forward from
January.  Florida frozen concentrated orange juice (FCOJ) yield forecast for the
2010-2011 season is 1.57 gallons per box at 42.0 degrees Brix, down 2 percent
from the January 1 forecast but up 1 percent from last season's final yield
of 1.56 gallons per box. The early-midseason portion is projected at
1.50 gallons per box, down 1 percent from last season's yield of 1.51 gallons
per box. The Valencia portion is projected at 1.64 gallons per box, 1 percent
higher than last year's final yield of 1.63 gallons per box. All projections
of yield assume the processing relationships this season will be similar to
those of the past several seasons.  Utilized Production of Citrus Fruits by Crop - States and  United States : 2009-

California during January. The water content of the Sierra Nevada snow pack,
which rose about 16 inches in December, increased only one inch during
January. The dry regime also stretched eastward into the Four Corners States.
Farther north, warmth and melting snow accompanied a period of heavy
precipitation from the Pacific Northwest to the northern Rockies, leading to
some flooding.  Farther east, frequent snowfall blanketed the northern Plains and the upper
Midwest, insulating winter grains but hampering rural travel and stressing
livestock. In contrast, drought continued to expand and intensify across the
southern half of the Plains. From November 28 to January 30, the portion of
the winter wheat crop rated in very poor to poor condition increased from
26 to 52 percent in Texas, 8 to 40 percent in  Oklahoma , and 25 to 37 percent
in  Kansas .  Elsewhere, January precipitation was generally below average across the South
and East. Exceptions included Florida's peninsula and southern and eastern
Texas, which received drought-easing rainfall, and the northern Atlantic
region, which experienced record-setting snowfall. Despite frequent January
showers across the South, long-term drought remained a concern in many areas.  Colder than normal weather dominated the eastern half of the Nation during
January, while near to above normal temperatures covered most areas from the
High Plains westward. Monthly temperatures averaged at least 5 degrees
Fahrenheit below normal in parts of the southern Atlantic region and a few
locations in the upper Midwest.  January Agricultural Summary  With the exception of portions of  New England , temperatures east of the Great
Plains were near to below average during January. Most notably, locations in
the northern Great Plains and Southeast recorded temperatures that dipped to
as many as 8 degrees below normal. In contrast, much of the Great Basin,
Pacific Northwest, and northern  Rocky Mountains  experienced warmer than
normal temperatures. Precipitation totals varied drastically from one region
to another, with the northern Great Plains, southern Texas, and central
Florida accumulating snow and rain totaling 200 percent or more above normal.  A series of winter storms brought hard freezes and frosts to much of Florida
during the month, negatively impacting the State's winter vegetable,
strawberry, and sugarcane crops. With producers harvesting when the first
cold spell hit, growth of the 2010 sugarcane crop was halted and some cane
that was to be used for replanting next season was destroyed. Following the
freeze, producers quickly harvested their remaining crop in hopes of limiting
deterioration and sucrose loss. Similarly, yield and quality were decreased
in many vegetable crops, leaving market movement below normal throughout the
month.  Elsewhere, unusually wet weather fell on portions of California during the
first week of the month, slowing fieldwork and causing yellowing and water
stress in some low-lying wheat fields. In the San Joaquin Valley, harvest of
citrus crops slowed mid to late month due to inconsistent sizing and quality.
As vegetable fields and orchard floors began to dry out toward month's end,
producers resumed planting, maintenance, and harvest activities.  Producers in several States were busy cultivating, fertilizing, and
irrigating fields in preparation for spring planting. While vegetable
producers in Arizona continued to ship a variety of crops throughout the
month, cotton and alfalfa hay harvest activities were winding down toward
month's end. On the central Plains, portions of the winter wheat crop were
left vulnerable to wind and freeze damage because of limited snow cover and
dry soil conditions.  Crop Comments  Sugarcane: Production of sugarcane for sugar and seed in 2010 is forecast at
28.1 million tons, of which 26.4 million tons will be utilized for sugar and
1.67 million tons for seed. Total production for sugar and seed is down
5 percent from the previous forecast and down 8 percent from 2009. Producers
expect to harvest 882,200 acres for sugar and seed for the 2010 crop year, up
1,000 acres from January and 8,300 acres from the previous year. Expected
yield is forecast at 31.8 tons per acre, down 1.7 tons from the previous
forecast and 3.0 tons from 2009.  Production in Florida is forecast at 12.9 million tons, down 10 percent from
January and down 7 percent from last year. Hard freezes in late December and
January negatively impacted the sugarcane crop in the Everglades region of
Florida, leaving portions of some seed cane fields unsalvageable while
reducing yields in others. As a result, sugar and seed yield is forecast at
32.9 tons per acre, down 3.8 tons from January and down 3.1 tons from 2009.
Estimates for Hawaii,  Louisiana , and Texas were carried forward from January.  Grapefruit: The 2010-2011 United States grapefruit crop is forecast at
1.20 million tons, unchanged from the January 1 forecast but down 2 percent
from the 2009-2010 crop.  Florida grapefruit production is forecast at 19.6 million boxes
(833,000 tons), unchanged from the previous forecast but down 3 percent from
last season. The Florida all white grapefruit forecast is 5.60 million boxes
(238,000 tons), down 7 percent from the 2009-2010 season. White grapefruit
droppage is expected to be slightly above average. The colored grapefruit
forecast, at 14.0 million boxes (595,000 tons), is 2 percent below last
season. California and Texas grapefruit production forecasts are carried
forward from the January 1 forecast.  Tangerines and mandarins: The United States tangerine and mandarin crop is
forecast at 605,000 tons, up 2 percent from both the January 1 forecast and
the 2009-2010 crop. Florida's tangerine crop is forecast at 4.40 million
boxes (209,000 tons), up 5 percent from the previous forecast but down
1 percent from the previous season. Arizona and California tangerine and
mandarin production forecasts are carried forward from the January 1
forecast.  Tangelos: Florida's tangelo forecast is 1.00 million boxes (45,000 tons),
unchanged from the January 1 forecast but up 11 percent from last season's
final utilization.  Florida citrus: In the citrus growing areas, temperatures were predominantly
in the 70s during the month. Weather stations reported lows in the 30s and
highs in the 80 degree range. Drought conditions worsened during the first
part of the month, however rainfall during the latter part lessened the
drought conditions in many counties.  Harvesting of Murcott and Sunburst tangerines continued, while harvesting of
Navel oranges was winding down. Harvesting of grapefruit and early and
midseason oranges continued on schedule.  Almost all of the processing plants have opened. Early and midseason oranges
and grapefruit made up the majority of fruit going to the plants. Heavy
irrigation and harvesting dominated the grove activities this month.  California citrus: The navel orange, mandarin, lemon, pummelo, and grapefruit
harvests continued in the San Joaquin Valley. Lemons and grapefruit were also
picked in the desert region. Fruit and nut nursery stock plants continued to
be prepared for sale in Sutter County. Cool, overcast weather kept orchard
floors from drying, which slowed weed and soil pest treatments.  California noncitrus fruits and nuts: New grape vineyards were being planted
in Fresno County, while herbicides were applied in Napa County vineyards.
Some young strawberry fields along the Central Coast suffered from Anthomyiid
and Sciarid fly infestations. Blueberry and raspberry plants arrived from
out-of-state for transplanting. With the exception of citrus and avocado,
fruit trees, vines, and nut trees were in dormancy for the winter. Dormant
orchards and vineyards continued to be pruned and sprayed as part of their
off-season maintenance.  Almond pruning and orchard removal was ongoing in the Central Valley as field
conditions allowed.  Statistical Methodology  Survey procedures: The orange objective yield survey for the February 1
forecast was conducted in Florida, which produces about 75 percent of the
United States production. Bearing tree numbers are determined at the start of
the season based on a fruit tree census conducted every other year, combined
with ongoing review based on administrative data or special surveys. From
mid-July to mid-September, the number of fruit per tree is determined. In
September and subsequent months, fruit size measurement and fruit droppage
surveys are conducted, which are combined with the previous components to
develop the current forecast of production. California and Texas conduct
grower and packer surveys on a quarterly basis in October, January, April,
and July. California conducts an objective measurement survey in September
for navel oranges and in March for Valencia oranges.  Estimating procedures: State level objective yield estimates for Florida
oranges were reviewed for errors, reasonableness, and consistency with
historical estimates. Reports from growers and packers in California and
Texas were also used for setting estimates. These three States submit their
analyses of the current situation to the Agricultural Statistics Board (ASB).
The ASB uses the survey data and the State analyses to prepare the published
February 1 forecast.  Revision policy: The February 1 production forecast will not be revised. A
new forecast will be made each month throughout the growing season.
End-of-season estimates will be published in the Citrus Fruits Summary
released in September. The production estimates are based on all data
available at the end of the marketing season, including information from
marketing orders, shipments, and processor records. Allowances are made for
recorded local utilization and home use.  Reliability: To assist users in evaluating the reliability of the February 1
production forecast, the "Root Mean Square Error," a statistical measure
based on past performance, is computed. The deviation between the February 1
production forecast and the final estimate is expressed as a percentage of
the final estimate. The average of squared percentage deviations for the
latest 20-year period is computed. The square root of the average becomes
statistically the "Root Mean Square Error." Probability statements can be
made concerning expected differences in the current forecast relative to the
final end-of-season estimate, assuming factors affecting this year's forecast
are not different from those influencing recent years.  The "Root Mean Square Error" for the February 1 orange production forecast is
3.4 percent. However, if you exclude the 4 abnormal production years (2
freeze seasons and 2 hurricane seasons), the "Root Mean Square Error" is
3.2 percent. This means chances are 2 out of 3 that the current orange
production forecast will not be above or below the final estimate by more
than 3.4 percent, or 3.2 percent excluding abnormal seasons. Chances are 9
out of 10 (90 percent confidence level) that the difference will not exceed
5.9 percent, or 5.5 percent, excluding abnormal seasons.  Changes between the February 1 orange forecast and the final estimates during
the past 20 years have averaged 312,000 tons (302,000 tons excluding abnormal
seasons), ranging from 18,000 tons to 638,000 tons (18,000 tons to
638,000 tons, excluding abnormal seasons). The February 1 forecast for
oranges has been below the final estimate 7 times and above 13 times (below
7 times and above 9 times, excluding abnormal seasons). The difference does
not imply the February 1 forecast this year is likely to understate or
overstate final production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
