Oil climbed in  New York  for the
first time in three days as escalating violence in Libya,  Africa ’s third-largest producer, renewed concern that supply
disruptions may spread to the Middle East.  Futures rose as much as 0.6 percent as fighting shut
Libya’s biggest oil refinery. Violence has cut exports by two-
thirds, according to the  International Energy Agency . Brent
futures in London advanced for a second day as forces loyal to  Muammar Qaddafi  attacked oil facilities. In Saudi Arabia, the
world’s biggest exporter, websites have called for a “Day of
Rage” tomorrow, New York-based  Human Rights Watch  said.  “Reports are showing the fighting in Libya is
escalating,” Serene Lim, an energy and commodity strategist at
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in  Singapore , said by
telephone today. “Every threat of further unrest will
definitely support prices.”  Crude for April delivery gained as much as 59 cents to
$104.97 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . It was at $104.79 at 2:27 p.m. Singapore
time. Yesterday, the contract dropped 64 cents to $104.38.
Prices are 28 percent higher than a year earlier.    Brent crude  for April settlement added as much as 61 cents,
or 0.5 percent, to $116.55 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. Yesterday, it advanced $2.88, or 2.6
percent, to $115.94, after Bank of America Merrill Lynch said
prices could surge above $140 in the second quarter.  Brent Premium  Brent’s gains widened the European benchmark’s premium to
New York-traded West Texas Intermediate to $11.47 a barrel
today, from $8.04 on March 8, according to Bloomberg data. The
gap averaged 76 cents last year. April futures in  London 
exceeded WTI for the same period by a record $17.11 on Feb. 15
as rising supplies depressed U.S. prices relative to Brent.  Oil in New York declined yesterday after stockpiles surged
to the highest level since 2004 at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the
delivery point for WTI. The Energy Department said Cushing
supplies increased 1.69 million barrels to 40.3 million last
week, the highest since it began gathering data at the hub.  U.S. crude stockpiles rose 2.52 million barrels to 348.9
million, the Energy Department report showed yesterday. A 1
million-barrel increase was projected, according to the median
of 15 analyst responses in a Bloomberg News survey.  Gasoline inventories fell 5.49 million barrels to 229.2
million, the biggest volume decline since September 2008,
according to the department. Stockpiles were forecast to drop
1.5 million barrels. Supplies of distillate fuel, a category
that includes heating oil and diesel, declined 3.98 million
barrels to 155.2 million, the lowest level since June.    Libya  Violence  The violence has cut output in Libya by as much as 1
million barrels a day, according to the IEA. The North African
country pumped 1.39 million barrels a day in February, down from
1.59 million the previous month, based on Bloomberg estimates.  Warplanes sent from Qaddafi’s home region of Sirte struck
the Ras Lanuf refinery, the country’s largest crude-processing
plant, Al Jazeera television said. The nation’s biggest oil
terminal, at the port of Sidra, was hit and part was in flames,
Al Jazeera said.  Demonstrations have toppled leaders in Tunisia and  Egypt ,
and protests have erupted in energy-exporting countries
including Iran, Oman and Yemen. Oil surged to a record $147.27 a
barrel on July 11, 2008, before plunging 78 percent in the next
five months to a low of $32.40 as the financial crisis unfolded.  Product Prices  Fighting in Libya has also inflated the cost of refined oil
products. Gasoline for April delivery advanced as much as 2.1
cents, or 0.7 percent, to $3.0482 a gallon today.  A pipeline carrying oil to  Turkey  from  Iraq  has been
damaged by an explosion, according to an official, knocking out
as much as a quarter of crude exports. The explosion was an act
of sabotage and has cut shipments by up to 590,000 barrels a
day, Emad al-Baqer, North Oil Co. head of production, said in an
interview from Kirkuk.    Saudi Arabia  is capable of providing additional oil output
if needed to counter supply disruptions caused by the unrest in
the Middle East, James Smith, U.S. ambassador to the kingdom,
said in an Bloomberg Television interview on “InBusiness with
Margaret Brennan.” The kingdom has increased oil production by
1 million barrels a day and has the capacity to pump another 3.5
million, Smith said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
