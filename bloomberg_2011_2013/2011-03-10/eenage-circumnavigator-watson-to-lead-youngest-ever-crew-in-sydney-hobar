Jessica Watson, who last year
became the youngest to sail solo, nonstop and unassisted around
the world, will lead the youngest crew to compete in the Sydney
to Hobart race, organizers said.  Watson, 17, will skipper Sydney 38 class boat Another
Challenge in the 2011 edition of the 628-nautical mile race. Her
crew of six other Australians and three Britons will all be aged
21 or under, making it the race’s youngest ever with an average
age of 19, the Cruising Yacht Club of  Australia  said.  “It has been a busy process selecting our crew,” Watson
said today in a statement on the race website. “We have just
spent a week training together in  Melbourne  and getting to know
each other and everyone has bonded so well.”  The 2011 race will start Dec. 26 from Sydney Harbour and
takes competitors along Australia’s southeastern coast and
across Bass Strait, where currents between the Southern Ocean
and  Tasman Sea  create a channel of powerful storm waves, to
Hobart, the capital of the island state of Tasmania.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
