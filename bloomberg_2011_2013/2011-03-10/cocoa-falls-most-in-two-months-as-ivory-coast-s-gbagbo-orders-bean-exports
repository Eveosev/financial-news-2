Cocoa fell, capping the longest
slump in nine weeks, on signs that exports will rise from  Ivory
Coast , the world’s largest producer. Coffee headed for the
biggest drop since August as raw materials slumped.  Ivory Coast President  Laurent Gbagbo  ordered companies to
export  cocoa beans  by the end of this month or face sanctions,
said Ahoua Don Mello, a spokesman for the government. Rival
Alassane Ouattara, the internationally recognized winner of a
late November election, called for a halt to exports in late
January to cut off funds to Gbagbo.  “Today’s drop is a big reverberation of the Gbagbo
order,” said  Hector Galvan , a senior trading adviser at RJO
Futures in Chicago. “Everyone is running now to sell.”  Cocoa for May delivery fell $82, or 2.3 percent, to settle
at $3,445 a metric ton at 12:04 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York . The price dropped for the third straight session, the
longest slide since Jan. 6. Earlier, the commodity touched
$3,328, the lowest since Feb. 10. The most-active contract has
climbed 23 percent since the election.  In  London , cocoa futures for May delivery slid 15 pounds,
or 0.7 percent, to 2,244 pounds ($3,601) a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Shipments of beans registered at Ivory Coast’s ports for
export dropped to 277 tons in the 14 days ended March 3 from
50,738 a year earlier.  Arabica-coffee futures for May delivery tumbled 15.35
cents, or 5.2 percent, to $2.795 a pound in New York, heading
for the biggest drop since Aug. 24.  14-Year High  Yesterday, the price reached $2.9665, the highest for a
most-active contract since May 1997. Coffee has more than
doubled in the past year as global supplies trailed demand.  Commodities headed for the largest decline in almost four
months, and equities slid as  China ’s export growth slowed and
Spain’s credit rating was cut.  “The commodities are facing pressure today because of
macroeconomic developments,” said  Rodrigo Costa , the vice
president of institutional sales at Newedge USA LLC in New York.
“The fundamentals have not changed overnight.”  In London, robusta-coffee futures for May delivery declined
$49, or 1.9 percent, to $2,508 a ton.  Cotton futures for May delivery slid 3.24 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $2.017 a pound in New York. The commodity rose to a
record of $2.197 on March 7.  To contact the reporters on this story:
