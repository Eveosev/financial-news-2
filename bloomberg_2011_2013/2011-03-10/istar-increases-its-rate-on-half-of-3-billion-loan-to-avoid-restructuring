  IStar Financial Inc. (SFI) , the
commercial real-estate financing company that is extending debt
maturities to avoid restructuring, has increased the rate it’s
offering to lenders on half of a $3 billion loan, according to
two people with knowledge of the matter.  A $1.5 billion A-2 debt due June 2014 will pay 5.5
percentage points more than the London interbank offered rate,
compared with 4.75 percentage points initially proposed, said
the people who declined to be identified because the terms are
private. The floor on the lending benchmark remains at 1.25
percent, and the New York-based company will sell the loan at
98.5 cents on the dollar, as initially proposed, the people
said.  “That’s a step in the right direction,” Adam Steer, an
analyst at New York-based credit research firm CreditSights,
said today in a telephone interview. “The increased rate on the
A-2 portion is a more comfortable level, but the A-1 at 325
basis points is still low. There are questions about the
collateral backing this loan, and, consequently investors should
be compensated adequately to take that risk.”  Lenders must let JPMorgan Chase & Co., the bank leading the
financing, know by 5 p.m. today in  New York  if they will
participate in the deal, one of the people said.  Lenders will get 18 months of soft-call protection, the
person said, meaning that IStar would have to pay 1 cent more
than face value for the first year to reprice the debt, then 0.5
cent more than face value to reprice the debt in the next six
months.  IStar’s $1.5 billion A-1 loan due in June 2013 will pay
3.25 percentage points more than Libor with a 1.25 percent
floor, the people said. That debt will be sold at 99.5 cents on
the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
