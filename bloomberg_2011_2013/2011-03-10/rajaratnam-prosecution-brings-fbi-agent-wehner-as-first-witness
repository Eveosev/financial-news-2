The first witness called by the
prosecution in Galleon Group LLC founder Raj Rajaratnam’s
criminal trial for  insider trading  is Diane Wehner, a special
agent for the FBI.  Rajaratnam is the central figure in the largest
investigation of hedge-fund insider trading in U.S. history. The
Sri Lankan-born money manager is accused of making $45 million
from confidential information leaked by corporate insiders and
hedge-fund traders. Rajaratnam may spend as long as 20 years in
prison if convicted of fraud.  Yesterday in opening arguments the U.S. said Rajaratnam
used an illegal network of secret sources to earn millions of
dollars in illicit profits, while his defense claimed he made
decisions based only on public information. The prosecution is
relying on wiretaps it made of Rajaratnam’s phone conversations.  U.S. District Judge  Richard Holwell , who’s conducting the
trial, has said it may last 2 ½ months.  Federal prosecutors in  Manhattan  have announced charges
against more than three dozen traders, corporate insiders,
expert networking consultants and lawyers since Rajaratnam’s
arrest in October 2009. The investigation may last another two
years, prosecutors have said.  The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
