Republican National Committee
Chairman Reince Priebus said in an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s “Political Capital with  Al Hunt ” airing this
weekend that he expects the  House of Representatives , controlled
by his party, to enact some “major” revision of U.S.
immigration laws within the next year.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot

Priebus. Thank you for being with us, Mr. Chairman.  REINCE PRIEBUS: I’m happy to be here.  HUNT: Let’s start with  Chris Christie . A huge re-election
victory. Is this a model for Republicans in 2016?  PRIEBUS: Well, I certainly - if you can have that kind of
success and copy it all over America, certainly I’ll take that
model. But Chris is a special kind of candidate. And I would
just say the type of candidate, a lot like  Scott Walker , who
makes a promise and keeps a promise. And I just said what this
party and both parties needs - need are people of their word
that win elections and govern like they campaigned. And that’s
what he’s getting rewarded for.  HUNT: Is Chris Christie the frontrunner for the next
presidential race? Some people even say the de facto leader of
the party.  PRIEBUS: I don’t know about that. I think we’ve got a
pretty deep bench, Al. I really do. He’s certainly going to be a
prominent figure in our party moving forward. He’s going to take
over the RGA in a month or so.  HUNT: But there’s no frontrunner right now?  PRIEBUS: Well I don’t - I don’t think so. It’s three years
away. So - but certainly he’s got a case to be made, as well as
a few others. So we’re proud of what he did. We were a big part
of the ground game there, as well as in  Virginia , and it worked.  HUNT: Let’s talk about Virginia.  Ken Cuccinelli ’s campaign
blames the loss on insufficient support from national
Republicans. You gave --  PRIEBUS: Well that’s not true. Chris LaCivita, who was the
chairman of the campaign, actually said that the help from the
RGA and the RNC was - was - was very much appreciated and was in
fact other groups that didn’t participate that he was pointing a
finger. I just want to make sure that we know who they’re
pointing fingers at.  HUNT: Well, but there’s some of them also who point the
finger at you in that campaign. Because I’ve talked to them, and
say they like in early October they were almost - they were
down. There was nothing. And you did give $3 million.  PRIEBUS: Not me.  HUNT: No, I know, but you gave $3 million for that ground
game. But previous - four years earlier, the RNC gave $9
million.  PRIEBUS: And for years before that the RNC gave $1.5
million. So --  HUNT: But the - but the ’09 race was a lot easier than this
race.  PRIEBUS: But here’s the thing. What’s really unique about
’09 which I think we have to get straight is the reason why the
RGA and the RNC divided up the cost the way they did was that
McCain-Palin transferred into the RNC $23 million in January of
’09.  HUNT: Do you think Ken Cuccinelli lost because of
insufficient resources, or because it was a flawed candidacy?  PRIEBUS: Well no, I think there’s a lot of reasons for it.
Obviously they talk about the shutdown. We talk about money. You
can talk about all kinds of issues and tactics, but ultimately I
think that if there was a few more days I think Ken would have
won. And I think - and the reason is is because of Obamacare
coming into play  HUNT: So your predecessor,  Michael Steele , when he says
that you - you left money on the table, that there should have
been money put in there because you had it in the bank, he’s
just dead wrong?  PRIEBUS: No, I don’t think - first of all, I don’t think
he’s saying that. But I think the circumstances are different. I
also took over a  Republican Party  that was $26 million in debt.
So what I would say is everything’s different. In ’09, I’m not
criticizing the decision to spend $9 million. What I’m saying
though is that when you start with $23 million and you sit down
with the other party committee and you divide out how are we
going to spend this money, I have an idea. Let’s take some of
this $23 million from McCain-Palin and let’s put some of that
$23 million on television. And the RGA can then spend $6 million
and the RNC can spend $9 million. This year we got together in
the beginning of the year and the decision was that the RNC
spend the $3 million to fund the ground game and the RGA would
spend $8 million to --  HUNT: My head is swimming.  But let me ask, you basically think you did everything you
could have done for that election?  PRIEBUS: Under the circumstances, sure.  HUNT: Does the election - do the elections of 2013 presage
anything for 2014?  PRIEBUS: Absolutely they do, and that’s why you have to -
you can’t go broke in December of 2013 when you’ve got Senate
races, governor races, targeted House races that you need to
fund the next year. And - and the reason why we’re optimistic of
course is that while a week ago Ken was down by double digits,
with Obamacare coming into play and with the ground game we put
out on the field, he closed the gap. I actually think there’s a
lot more positives here. Now certainly we’d want to win, but
that should give us a lot of hope for next year.  HUNT: Let me ask you about Obamacare. The rollout has been
absolutely horrible, as you know. You say it has - it has helped
Republicans politically. There’s going to be a continuing
resolution, a budget up again in January. Given how bad the
rollout was - should Republicans again say the condition for
approving a budget is to defund Obamacare?  PRIEBUS: I don’t know what the tactics are going to be in
the next month. I know that people like Paul Ryan and - and  Jeff Sessions  are trying to get something really significant done as
far as debt reduction here in December. I know that’s their
goal. Certainly I don’t think a shutdown is smart for us to go
through that again. I wouldn’t want to see that.  HUNT: No more shutdowns. How about a debt ceiling?  PRIEBUS: Well, look.  Mitch McConnell  made the pledge that
there wouldn’t be a shutdown. I take him at his word.  HUNT: Let me ask you about your post-election growth and
opportunity project. The RNC said Latinos and Asian-Americans
consider the party unwelcoming and Republicans “must embrace
and champion comprehensive immigration reform.” The Senate has
done that. Would it hurt Republicans if the House does not
follow suit and refuses to pass a comprehensive bill?  PRIEBUS: Well I’m not sure what they’re going to do. I
think that in fact the idea that either a comprehensive approach
or a multi-tiered approach is not going to happen by the end of
the year, I don’t think that that’s necessarily true. I think
that it can happen, and I think people like  Paul Ryan  and others
still want something like that to happen.  HUNT: But if it didn’t - I guess what I’m asking is if it -
if it shouldn’t happen, would that -  PRIEBUS: It could happen next year. It could happen - I
don’t think there’s any sort of midnight hour here.  HUNT: You think the House will pass a major immigration
bill in this Congress?  PRIEBUS: I think so. That’s my gut.  HUNT: You do. And we can call it comprehensive?  PRIEBUS: Well, look. Rand Paul came out for comprehensive
immigration reform too, but what does - comprehensive
immigration reform to you could be these four things and to me
it could be six things. As far as how you want to - what
terminology you want to use, it’s your prerogative. I do think
though that something significant is going to happen because
obviously mass deportation is not an option. I don’t think doing
nothing is an option. And I believe most people would agree that
something significant needs to take place. Now what that is, I
don’t get to make that decision.  HUNT: The RNC report noted the problems that the
Republicans have with younger voters, many of whom have a very
tolerant view about gay rights, which you said “is a gateway”
and whether the party -  PRIEBUS: I didn’t write the report.  HUNT: No, I know, but it’s your report. It’s the RNC
report.  PRIEBUS: It’s the report of a committee through the RNC.  HUNT: Right, but it said - and you embraced the report
basically in saying -  PRIEBUS: I embraced parts of the report.  HUNT: But they said - anyway, they - they said it’s a
gateway. Gay rights is a gateway and whether the party is the
place they want to be. Now the Senate passed a bill that outlaws
discrimination against gays and lesbians in the workplace. A
number of Republicans supported it. Should the House do the
same?  PRIEBUS: Well, I don’t know all the details of the bill,
Al. I understand there are some problems and some technicalities
with unisex issues that I don’t - I don’t fully understand. I
haven’t seen it. But as far as discrimination in the workplace,
no, I don’t agree with that. But I think the problem with that
bill is that it includes a whole lot more than just that issue.
So I’m not a legislator. I don’t get to - to make these
decisions, Al. Our party believes in traditional marriage.  HUNT: You don’t think it’ll affect the party’s standing
with young voters if the House passes a bill or not?  PRIEBUS: I think we’re doing pretty well with young voters.
If you look at the youth movement in this country and you see
what even in the libertarian movement that’s sweeping across
college campuses, they’re young people. And so that’s why I
think it’s multi-tiered. I don’t think it’s one size fits all.  HUNT: Chairman Priebus, as always, it’s really good to see
you.  PRIEBUS: Thank you.  HUNT: Thank you very much for being with us.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
