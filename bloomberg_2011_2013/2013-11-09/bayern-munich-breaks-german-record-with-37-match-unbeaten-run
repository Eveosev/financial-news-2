Bayern Munich beat Augsburg 3-0 to
set a record for the longest unbeaten run in the history of
German soccerâ€™s Bundesliga.  Jerome Boateng,  Franck Ribery  and  Thomas Mueller  scored for
Bayern, which has gone 37 games since losing at Bayer Leverkusen
in October 2012. Hamburg set the previous mark of 36 in 1982 and
1983.  Bayern now has a four-point lead in the standings over
Borussia Dortmund, which lost 2-1 at Wolfsburg, and Leverkusen,
which defeated Hamburg 5-3.  In Spain, Cristiano Ronaldo scored three goals to help Real
Madrid to a 5-1 win over Real Sociedad. The victory moved Real
within three points of first-place Barcelona and two of second-place Atletico Madrid, with both of those teams playing
tomorrow.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
