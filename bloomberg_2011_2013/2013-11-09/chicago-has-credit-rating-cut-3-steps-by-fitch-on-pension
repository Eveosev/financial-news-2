Chicago, the third-most-populous U.S.
city, had its  credit rating  lowered three steps on more than $8
billion of debt by  Fitch Ratings , which cited the city’s growing
unfunded pension liability.  Fitch cut the rating on $8 billion of Chicago’s general-obligation bonds to A- from AA-, the New York-based company said
today in a statement. It also took the same action on $500
million of debt backed by the Windy City’s sales taxes.  It’s the second three-step rating cut for Chicago since
July, when Moody’s Investors Service lowered its grade to A3,
the fourth-lowest investment-quality category, citing pension
burdens and the costs of crime. Mayor  Rahm Emanuel , a 53-year-old Democrat, has proposed raising the city’s cigarette sales
tax by 75 cents a pack to help close a deficit of $339 million.  Chicago, a city of more than 2.7 million residents, is
projecting a budget deficit of as much as $1 billion in 2015
unless the Illinois legislature restructures the public-pension
system, which is a state creation. Lawmakers adjourned their
fall session yesterday without taking any action.  Sarah Hamilton, a spokeswoman for the mayor, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the Fitch
downgrade sent after normal business hours.  To contact the reporters on this story:
