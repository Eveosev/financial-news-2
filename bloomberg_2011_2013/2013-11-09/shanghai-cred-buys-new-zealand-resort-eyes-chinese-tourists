Shanghai CRED Real Estate Co. has
purchased a  New Zealand  resort hotel as well as an adjacent
vineyard and golf course which it plans to develop and promote
to wealthy Chinese tourists.  Acquisition of the  Peppers Carrington  resort at Karikari,
about 330 kilometers (205 miles) north of Auckland by road, was
completed recently after being approved by the government in
July, Shanghai CRED said in an e-mailed statement.  The resort “can provide the sort of holiday experience
that high-income Chinese and other international tourists are
seeking,” Guo Gui, general manager of Shanghai CRED, said in
the statement. His company has been involved with similar
properties in  China  and will promote Carrington through its many
tourism contacts, he said.  China is New Zealand’s second-biggest source of tourists
after  Australia . Spending by Chinese visitors is predicted to
surge 55 percent by 2018, according to government forecasts
published in August.  Shanghai CRED bought the 1,100-hectare (2,700-acre)
property from a U.S.- based owner, it said in the statement. The
purchase price was treated as confidential when the  Overseas
Investment Office  granted consent in July, and isn’t being
disclosed, Cedric Allan, a New Zealand spokesman for the buyer,
said in a telephone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
