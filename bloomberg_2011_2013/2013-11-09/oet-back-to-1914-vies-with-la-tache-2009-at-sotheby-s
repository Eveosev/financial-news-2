Moet & Chandon Champagne from
vintages back to 1914 goes on sale at a Sotheby’s wine auction
in London this week along with La Tache 2009 Domaine de la
Romanee Conti Burgundy and Le Pin 1990 Pomerol from Bordeaux.  Bottles of Moet spanning the years from 2004 back to the
start of World War I are estimated to fetch more than 100,000
pounds ($160,000) in total, and include 174 magnums and three
jeroboams, according to Sotheby’s. Three two-bottle lots of 1914
Champagne are each priced at as much as 6,000 pounds.  The auction marks the 270th anniversary of Moet & Chandon,
which is now part of  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) , the
world’s largest luxury goods company. While the auction comes as
the Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index has given up gains made in the
first 10 weeks of the year, after investors deterred by prices
of recent Bordeaux wines diversified outside the region, there
are signs of broader wine-market activity.  “The market may seem quiet, but we’ve had our busiest
August, September and October ever,” said Joss Fowler, Director
of Fine Wine at London broker  Fine+Rare .  A case of La Tache 2009 DRC Burgundy is estimated to fetch
as much 32,000 pounds, making it potentially the most expensive
lot in the auction, while 12 bottles of Le Pin 1990 from the
Pomerol estate may sell for as much as 26,000 pounds, according
to  Sotheby’s. (BID)   The sale also includes two six-bottle lots of Chateau
Gruaud Larose, from Bordeaux’s Saint-Julien district, which were
on a ship wrecked in 1872 in Indonesian waters and discovered in
1991. While the catalog describes them as of unknown vintage,
Sotheby’s said in an e-mail they are believed to be from either
1869 or 1865, and have been reconditioned at the estate with new
labels, corks and capsules. Each lot is priced at as much as
2,200 pounds.  Here is a list of global wine auctions scheduled so far
for the rest of this year. Dates may be subject to revision,
