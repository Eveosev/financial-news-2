The European Central Bank will house
banking supervision staff in  Frankfurt ’s Eurotower, retaining
ties to the building and its iconic euro symbol even after new
offices are completed.  “This decision means that the ECB will maintain its link
with the Eurotower in Frankfurt, together with the large euro
symbol in front of it, which has become something of a
landmark,” the ECB said in a statement today.  European Central Bank oversight of euro-area lenders is
scheduled to start in full next year, part of an effort to
create a banking union that severs the links between banks and
the sovereign.  The bank’s new premises in Frankfurt’s Ostend district
“will not have sufficient space to accommodate the 1,000 or so
additional staff needed” as the bank assumes the role, the ECB
said, having been “designed at a time when the supervisory
tasks had not yet been envisaged.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
