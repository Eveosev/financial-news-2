Roger Federer  completed the semifinal
lineup at men’s tennis’s season finale, while  Novak Djokovic 
struggled before finishing the group stage unbeaten.  Federer, 32, came back from a set down, and then a break
down in each of the final two sets, to beat Argentina’s Juan
Martin del Potro 4-6, 7-6 (7-2), 7-5 at  London ’s O2 indoor
arena.  The win gave the Swiss his 11th semifinal in 12 appearances
at the ATP World Tour Finals, a tournament which is reserved for
the top eight men. He’ll face top-ranked  Rafael Nadal , a player
he hasn’t defeated since March 2012, tomorrow for a place in the
final.  “I just feel like I need to look at it more as being an
underdog a little bit,” Federer said of his match with the
Spaniard. “Maybe that free swinging is what I kind of need to
do a little bit more tomorrow.”  Djokovic completed his 100 percent record in group play
with a 7-6 (8-6), 4-6, 6-3 win over eliminated  Richard Gasquet 
of  France . The Serb had already guaranteed his semifinal spot
with earlier victories against Federer and del Potro.  Djokovic told reporters it was a mental challenge playing
a meaningless match of more than two hours with the semifinal on
tap tomorrow. He made 45 unforced errors to 33 for Gasquet.  The No. 2-ranked player and defending champion, Djokovic
next plays Stanislas Wawrinka. He’s won 14 of 16 previous
meetings with the Swiss and goes into the match riding a 20-match winning streak.  Federer, a 17-time Grand Slam singles champion has a 10-21
career record against Nadal, but is 4-0 indoors. He’s won the
season-ending event a record six times, while 13-time Grand Slam
winner Nadal’s best finish is a loss to Federer in the 2010
final.  In the doubles, third seeds Ivan Dodig and Marcelo Melo,
who’d already claimed a semifinal berth, beat eliminated Aisam-Ul-Haq Qureshi and Jean-Julien Rojer 7-5, 3-6, 11-9. Top seeds
Bob and  Mike Bryan  of the U.S. beat Mariusz Fyrstenberg and
Marcin Matkowski 4-6, 6-3, 10-5 to reach the last four.  To contact the reporter on this story:
