President  Barack Obama  took a break
from wrangling with Congress and the faulty rollout of his
health-care website to play golf in southern Florida.  The president arrived midmorning at Grande Oaks Golf Club,
a private club in Ft. Lauderdale, and home of the 1980 movie
comedy “Caddyshack,” according to the club’s website.  Wearing tan slacks and a light-blue polo shirt, Obama posed
for pictures and shook hands with club guests before hitting the
links.  Obama’s golf partners today are Alonzo Mourning, former
Miami Heat basketball star; Ambassador  Ron Kirk , former U.S.
Trade Representative; and Cyrus Walker, a guest of Mourning,
according to a White House e-mail.  “Grande Oaks offers members an exclusive atmosphere with
some of south  Florida ’s foremost socialites,” the club  website 
says. “The Raymond Floyd re-designed 18-hole championship
course, 40-acre practice facility and southern plantation style
clubhouse provides sanctuary, serenity and the utmost in
service.”  The day’s weather alternated between sunny skies and
occasional brief showers. The temperature today was in the 80s,
with high humidity.  Obama remained overnight in Miami after attending three
fundraisers in Miami and nearby Coral Gables yesterday for the
benefit of Democrats preparing for the 2014 midterm elections.  The president often plays golf on weekends when he’s in
Washington, going to the course at Joint Base Andrews in nearby
 Maryland  or at Fort Belvoir in Virginia. He is scheduled to
return to  Washington  later today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
