England  beat Argentina 31-12 in an
international rugby Test match, as world champion New Zealand
extended its winning streak to 12 matches.  Joe Launchbury, Billy Twelvetrees, Chris Ashton and Ben
Morgan scored tries at Twickenham Stadium in London, while Owen Farrell kicked 11 points. England led 24-6 at halftime and
couldn’t add to their tally until a late try in the second half
clinched the victory.  England has won the opening two games of its autumn
schedule heading into next week’s finale against New Zealand.
The English handed the All Blacks their most recent defeat,
38-21 last December in London.  “We’ve had two very tough Tests and we’ve come through
them,” England captain Chris Robshaw said in an interview with
Sky Sports. “We’ve got to go into next week and make sure we’re
switched on and ready.”  New Zealand beat France 26-19, South Africa won 24-15 in
 Wales ,  Australia  routed  Italy  50-20,  Scotland  beat  Japan  42-17
and Ireland defeated Samoa 40-9 on the first full weekend of
November internationals.  Tries from Launchbury, Twelvetrees and Ashton helped
England take the big halftime lead. Nicolas Sanchez kicked a
pair of penalties after the break to pull Argentina to 24-12
before Morgan went over with three minutes left to seal the win.  England has now won six-straight home matches, its longest
run since winning 22 in a row between 1999 and 2003. Argentina
lost for the seventh-consecutive game.  Charles Piutau and Kieran Read scored tries and Dan Carter
kicked 14 points for New Zealand, which took a 26-12 lead in
Paris and held off a late French rally. Brice Dulin touched down
and Morgan Parra kicked 14 points for  France , which has lost
four straight Test matches for the first time since 1989.  Jean de Villiers, Bismarck du Plessis and Fourie du Preez
scored tries to lead South Africa past Wales in Cardiff. Nick
Cummins scored two of Australia’s seven tries in Turin as the
Wallabies remained perfect in 16 meetings with Italy.  Scotland maintained its 100 percent mark against Japan with
a fourth-straight win as Tommy Seymour touched down twice and
Greig Laidlaw scored a try and kicked 10 points in Edinburgh.
David Kearney scored two of Ireland’s five tries in its rout of
Samoa in Dublin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
