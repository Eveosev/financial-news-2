Iceland’s special prosecutor indicted
Hannes Smarason, the former chairman of FL Group hf, on charges
of embezzling 2.875 billion kronur ($23.5 million) from the
 investment company  before it was renamed Stodir.  Smarason in 2005 transferred the cash from an FL Group
account to one controlled by a friend, who used the money to buy
Sterling Airlines A/S, according to a copy of the indictment e-mailed by prosecutors today.  Smarason didn’t answer two calls to his mobile phone
seeking comment.  He stepped down as CEO of FL Group in December 2007, a year
in which the company lost 67.2 billion kronur, according to its
financial statements. FL Group changed its name to Stodir hf
after placing a moratorium on its debt payments at the end of
September 2008. Creditors of the company agreed in 2009 to swap
debt for shares in Stodir.  To contact the reporter on this story:
