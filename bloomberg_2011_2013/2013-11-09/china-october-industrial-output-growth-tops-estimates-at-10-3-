China ’s  industrial output  rose 10.3
percent in October from a year earlier and retail sales gained
13.3 percent, the National Bureau of Statistics said on its
website today.  Fixed-asset investment  excluding rural households in the
first 10 months of the year increased 20.1 percent, the Beijing-based agency said.  The advance in industrial production compared with the 10
percent median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 44
economists and a 10.2 percent increase in September.  Retail
sales (CNRSCYOY)  compared with the median projection for a 13.4 percent
advance and a 13.3 percent increase the previous month.  The median estimate for fixed-asset investment was a 20.2
percent increase after a 20.2 percent gain in the first nine
months.  Data released earlier today showed  consumer prices  rose 3.2
percent in October from a year earlier, below the government’s
2013 target of 3.5 percent for a 10th month. Producer prices
fell a more-than-estimated 1.5 percent, the 20th straight
monthly decline.  --Nerys Avery. With assistance from Ailing Tan in  Singapore .
