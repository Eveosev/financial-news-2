Crude options volatility fell and
West Texas Intermediate futures rose after U.S. Secretary of
State  John Kerry  tempered expectations of a possible deal over
 Iran â€™s nuclear work.  Implied volatility for at-the-money January options, a
measure of expected futures swings and a key gauge of value, was
17.76 percent at settlement on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
down from 19.22 yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery rose 40
cents, or 0.4 percent, to settle at $94.60 a barrel on the
Nymex. WTI advanced with  Brent crude .  Puts accounted for 53 percent of electronic trading volume
today. The most-active options were April $65 puts, which fell 3
cents to 7 cents a barrel with 2,860 lots trading as of 5:28
p.m. February $110 calls fell 1 cent to 12 cents on volume of
2,151.  In the previous session, puts accounted for 53 percent of
the 87,832 lots traded. December $95 calls fell 39 cents to 73
cents a barrel with 5,248 contracts trading. December $90 puts
