Liverpool manager  Brendan Rodgers 
will ask the club’s owners for two “big” signings in January
in his bid to qualify for the  Champions League , the Mirror said.  Rodgers wants to add a striker and midfielder, with
Olympiacos center-forward Konstantinos Mitroglou his main
target, the Mirror said. Mitroglou may be available for as
little as 6 million pounds ($10 million), the newspaper said.  Liverpool’s owners have stressed the need for the club to
live within its means, but last week’s loss at Arsenal has led
Rodgers to emphasize the importance of the January transfer
period as the Reds seek to return to the Champions League, the
Mirror said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
