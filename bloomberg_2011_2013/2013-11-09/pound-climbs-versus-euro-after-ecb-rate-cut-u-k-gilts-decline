The pound climbed against the euro
for a second week, rising the most since April, after the
 European Central Bank  unexpectedly lowered its benchmark
 interest rate , boosting demand for the U.K. currency.  Sterling posted its first weekly advance in three versus
the dollar as reports showed British services growth
unexpectedly accelerated in October to the fastest pace in 16
years and a gauge of  house prices  jumped to a record. U.K.
government bonds declined for a second week as the  Bank of
England  kept its key  interest rate  at a record low and
maintained its bond-buying stimulus target.  “The move in the pound is more euro-specific because the
downtrend in the euro has accelerated,” said  Lee Hardman , a
currency strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in
London. “The data in the U.K. continues to surprise to the
upside and that’s supportive for the pound.”  The pound gained 1.4 percent to 83.52 pence per euro at
4:53 p.m. London time yesterday, the biggest advance since the
period ended April 26. It touched 83.01 pence on Nov. 7, the
strongest level since Jan. 17. Sterling climbed 0.4 percent to
$1.5995.  The ECB cut its main refinancing rate to 0.25 percent on
Nov. 7 after a drop in inflation to the slowest pace in four
years threatened its mission to keep prices stable. The Bank of
England left its asset-purchase  target  at 375 billion pounds and
the benchmark  interest rate  at a record-low 0.5 percent on the
same day. The London-based central bank has said it will keep
the rate low until  unemployment , currently at 7.7 percent, falls
below 7 percent.  Advance Pared  The pound pared its weekly advance against the dollar
yesterday after a U.S. report showed payrolls increased last
month more than economists forecast.  A U.K. services industry gauge rose to 62.5 from 60.3 in
September, the highest since May 1997,  Markit Economics  said on
Nov. 5 in London. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of
economists was for a reading of 60.  House values  in the U.K.
increased 0.6 percent from September to an average 237,161
pounds, London-based real-estate researcher Acadametrics and  LSL
Property Services Plc (LSL)  said yesterday.  Sterling has rallied 5 percent in the past six months, the
best performer among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro climbed 3.5
percent and the dollar rose 1.7 percent.  The 10-year gilt yield climbed 12 basis points, or 0.12
percentage point, this week to 2.77 percent. The 2.25 percent
bond due September 2023 fell 1.0, or 10 pounds per 1,000-pound
face amount, to 95.58.  Inflation Rate  U.K. inflation slowed to 2.5 percent last month from 2.7
percent in September, the  Office for National Statistics  will
say Nov. 12, according to the median estimate of analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey. Bank of England Governor  Mark Carney  will
present economic projections at his second quarterly inflation
report on Nov. 13, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. among those
forecasting the central bank will improve its outlook.  U.K. gilts lost 2.7 percent this year through Nov. 7,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German bonds dropped
1 percent and U.S. Treasuries declined 2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
