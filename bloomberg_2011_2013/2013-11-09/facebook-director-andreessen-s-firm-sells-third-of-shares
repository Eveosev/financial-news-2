Facebook Inc. (FB)  Director  Marc Andreessen ’s venture-capital firm sold a third of its holdings
in the world’s biggest social-networking service after the stock
price reached a record last month.  Andreessen Horowitz sold 2.28 million shares on Nov. 6,
according to a  filing  with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission yesterday. The shares were sold at about $49 to $50
apiece, making the divestment worth more than $111 million, the
data show. The firm still  holds  4.57 million shares.  Facebook reached a record valuation amid growing optimism
about the company’s prospects for making money off its more than
1 billion users, especially those logging on via mobile devices.
The company reported a 60 percent  surge  in revenue in the latest
quarter to $2.02 billion, exceeding analysts’ average projection
and adding fuel to a share rally that has pushed the stock up 79
percent so far this year.  “The investment and the return fully satisfies our venture
thesis,” Margit Wennmachers, a spokeswoman for Andreessen
Horowitz, said. “We’re obviously pleased with that.”  Peter Thiel , an early investor in Facebook and a board
member, sold more than $1 billion worth of the company’s shares
in the IPO and after the end of the first lockup period.  Facebook, based in Menlo Park, California, declined less
than 1 percent to $47.53 at yesterday’s close in New York.  Bloomberg LP, the parent of  Bloomberg News , is an investor
in Andreessen Horowitz.  To contact the reporter on this story:
