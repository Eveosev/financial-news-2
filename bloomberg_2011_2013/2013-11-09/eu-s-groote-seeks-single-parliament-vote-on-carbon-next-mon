The European Parliament may decide on
a draft law to help boost prices in the European Union’s carbon
market in a single vote next month, according to a proposal by
the head of the assembly’s environment committee.  Matthias Groote said that an accord by governments on the
draft plan yesterday speeds up the process by eliminating the
need to reconcile the final wording in negotiations with the
assembly, according to a letter sent to parliament president,
 Martin Schulz . The emergency fix for the carbon market would
enable temporary curbs on the supply of emission permits.  “I would like to recommend, on behalf of the Environment
Committee, that the European Parliament proceed with the vote on
the legislative resolution and conclude the first reading at its
plenary session of 9-12 December 2013,” Groote, who is in
charge of the measure in the Parliament, said in the letter,
obtained by  Bloomberg News .  The fast-track procedure, if approved by Schulz, would mean
the measure would need approval by the Parliament at the
December session and then consent from EU ministers to become
law. The Parliament already had an initial vote on the market
fix in July, when it amended the proposal by limiting to 900
million the number of carbon allowances that can be delayed at
auctions between 2013 and 2020 to curb record oversupply.  Representatives of EU governments, which consider the
proposal in a parallel procedure, decided yesterday to accept
the Parliament’s amendment without changes. Since both sides
agree on the wording of the draft law, no negotiations are
needed on the subject, according to Groote.  Member states  and the Parliament often hold such talks,
known as a trilogue because they also involve the European
Commission, to iron out the final version of a draft law before
it’s confirmed by the assembly and ministers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
