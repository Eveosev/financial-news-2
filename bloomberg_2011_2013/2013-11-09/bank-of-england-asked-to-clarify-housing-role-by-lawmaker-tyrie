The  Bank of England  must spell out
its role in the government’s Help to Buy housing program, said
 Andrew Tyrie , chairman of Parliament’s Treasury Committee.  “The scope and limits of the bank’s role in this scheme
need a good deal of clarification, both to safeguard the bank’s
authority to act in fulfillment of its statutory responsibility
for financial stability and to safeguard its independence,”
Tyrie said in an e-mailed statement.  The government has charged the BOE’s Financial Policy
Committee with carrying out an annual assessment starting in
September 2014 of Help to Buy, which aims to get more Britons
onto the property ladder by reducing deposit requirements.  The three-year program, which began in April, has drawn
criticism for risking a bubble when households are still
stretched from debt built up before the financial crisis.  House
prices  rose to a record last month, according to researcher
Acadametrics.  In a letter yesterday to BOE Governor  Mark Carney , Tyrie
asked for clarification on questions including the nature of the
bank’s oversight, whether Help to Buy has altered the bounds of
its authority and what advice has been given already. He also
sought “supporting work” prepared for the FPC on the links
between the housing market, the economic cycle and financial
stability.  Tyrie asked for the letter to be sent to the other nine
members of the FPC for discussion at its Nov. 20 policy meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
