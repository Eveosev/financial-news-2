The U.S. Treasury’s top
international official reiterated the Obama administration’s
view that financial rules must be consistent around the world.  “With financial markets that are more globally integrated
than ever, we need financial reforms that are more globally
convergent than ever,”  Lael Brainard , the Treasury Department’s
undersecretary for international affairs, said in testimony
prepared for a hearing tomorrow before the Senate Banking
Committee. The Treasury released Brainard’s comments today.  “We will not attain perfect alignment, and we will not get
everything right,” Brainard said. “Despite this, nothing could
be more costly than backtracking on reforms.” She said
countries’ “frameworks for derivatives must be tightly aligned
or differences could lead firms to move activities to
jurisdictions with lower standards, increasing risks to the
global financial system.”  Brainard also said it’s “essential for banks across the
world to measure risk-weighted assets similarly.” She is to
testify tomorrow with regulators, including Federal Reserve
Governor  Daniel Tarullo  and Martin J. Gruenberg, acting chairman
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., on international
cooperation on financial rules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
