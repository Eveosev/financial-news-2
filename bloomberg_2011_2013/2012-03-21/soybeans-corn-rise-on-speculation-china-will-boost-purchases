Soybeans rose for the first time
this week on speculation that reduced output in  South America 
will force Chinese importers to buy more from the U.S., the
world’s largest grower.  China  imported 3.83 million metric tons of soybeans in
February, up 65 percent from a year earlier and the most for the
month since before 2004, the Customs General Administration said
today. Processors may increase purchases for delivery from July
to October after Chicago futures tumbled yesterday, grain.gov.cn
said today in a report.  “Prices probably have found a level that will stimulate
new Chinese purchases from the U.S.,”  Jim Gerlach , the
president of A/C Trading Co. in Fowler,  Indiana , said in a
telephone interview. “A jump in Brazilian soybean-export prices
yesterday, when U.S. prices fell, makes U.S. supplies more
attractive to Chinese buyers.”  Soybean futures for May delivery rose 0.7 percent to close
at $13.55 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade,
after dropping 1.6 percent yesterday, the most since Jan. 30.
The oilseed has gained 14 percent in the past two months as hot,
dry weather reduced crops in Brazil and Argentina, the two
biggest producers after the U.S.  The U.S. was the largest exporter in the year that ended
Sept. 30, according to government estimates. The U.S. crop was
valued at $35.8 billion in 2011, second behind corn, government
figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
