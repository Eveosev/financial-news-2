Tanzania  is targeting a 46 percent
stake in a prospective soda-ash project with  India â€™s  Tata
Chemicals Ltd. (TTCH) , the  Citizen  reported, citing Trade and Industry
Minister Cyril Chami.  The approximately 460 billion cubic liters of soda ash
discovered at the Engaruka area, 50 kilometers from Lake Natron
in northern Tanzania, would require about $450 million to
develop, the Dar es Salaam-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
