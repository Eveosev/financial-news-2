What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures may open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel lower on
the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of Trade and
the  Minneapolis Grain Exchange  on speculation that rain in the
U.S. Great Plains this week will boost soil moisture for early
development and increase yield potential,  Jim Gerlach , the
president of A/C Trading Co. in Fowler,  Indiana , said in a
telephone interview.  -- Corn futures are called to open down 1 cent to 2 cents a
bushel in Chicago as rain and higher temperatures improve soil
conditions for rapid planting across the U.S. Midwest about two
weeks earlier than the first seeds are usually planted, boosting
yield potential, Gerlach said.  -- Soybean futures may open 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT on speculation that yesterdayâ€™s biggest drop in seven
weeks will boost demand for U.S. supplies from  China , the
biggest consumer of the oilseed, Gerlach said. Soybean-oil
futures are expected to open steady to 0.1 cent a pound higher,
and soybean-meal futures may open steady to 50 cents higher per
2,000 pounds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
