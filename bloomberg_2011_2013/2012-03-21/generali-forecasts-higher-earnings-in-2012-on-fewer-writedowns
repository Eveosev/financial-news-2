Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G) ,  Italy ’s
biggest insurer, said operating profit may rise as much as 15
percent this year on growth in its life and non-life operations.
The company missed profit estimates after incurring writedowns.  Operating income will at least match last year’s 3.9
billion euros ($5.2 billion) and may reach 4.5 billion euros in
2012, according to a presentation on the Trieste-based insurer’s
website today after it reported earnings. Generali expects
operating income of as much as 2.8 billion euros in the life
segment and as much as 1.9 billion euros in non-life.  The  shares fell  as the company’s outlook disappointed some
analysts, even as Chief Executive Officer Giovanni Perissinotto
said he expects “strong” profit growth this year. The insurer
is expanding in  emerging markets  and eastern  Europe  to boost
earnings following the financial crisis, while cutting costs,
improving efficiency and selling assets to strengthen capital.  “Despite the positive outlook for non-life, Generali has
announced quite cautious guidance,” Atanasio Pantarrotas, an
analyst at Cheuvreux, wrote in a report today.  Generali  declined  32 cents, or 2.4 percent, to 12.85 euros
at 11:20 a.m. in Milan trading. The stock has risen 11 percent
this year, trailing the 21 percent advance in the 28-company
Bloomberg Europe 500 Insurance Index.  “We are already seeing signs of recovery in the first
months of 2012,” Perissinotto said during a conference call.
“Generali expects a reduction of the significant level of non-
recurring components that affected results in 2011.”  Dividend Cut, Writedowns  Generali cut its dividend by 25 cents to 20 cents a share.
Net income declined to 856 million euros from 1.7 billion euros
a year earlier, missing the 1.1 billion-euro  average estimate  of
21 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Profit was hurt as the insurer wrote down the value of
Greek bonds by 76 percent. It also wrote down its stake in Telco
SpA, the largest investor in Telecom Italia SpA, bringing total
impairments above 1 billion euros last year. The gross exposure
to Greek sovereign debt at the end of the year was 700 million
euros, the insurer said.  Generali’s solvency ratio, a measure of its capacity to
absorb losses, reached 117 percent at the end of December. It
climbed to 132 percent by March 1 because of a rebound in
Italian  government bonds , the insurer said. The combined ratio,
a measure of claims and costs as a proportion of premiums,
improved to 96.5 percent from 98.8 percent a year earlier.  PPF Joint Venture  Generali may buy the 49 percent stake in its eastern
European venture it doesn’t own from PPF Group NV, using
“internal resources,” Perissinotto said. Generali would buy
the stake should its partner exercise a  put option  giving it the
right to sell in 2014, he said.  Generali and Amsterdam-based PPF formed a joint venture in
2007, combining their insurance assets in eastern Europe to
create a company with 9 million customers in 12 countries. PPF’s
put option is valued at 2.5 billion euros to 3 billion euros,
according to 2010 Generali’s annual report.  Perissinotto said Generali is also considering buying the
stake with a partner, as he received “several expressions of
interest.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
