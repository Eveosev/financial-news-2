Thousands of former  Bear Stearns
Cos. (BSC)  employees will share a $10 million settlement of lawsuits
claiming they lost money on the bank’s stock in their retirement
accounts.  Two ex-Bear Stearns employees yesterday asked a federal
court judge in  Manhattan  to approve the settlement on behalf of
an estimated 8,400 former colleagues.  The settlement will resolve class-action suits filed
beginning in 2008 against Bear Stearns and other defendants by
former employees of the bank. The employees, participants and
beneficiaries of Bear Stearns’s employee stock ownership plan
who held shares of the bank’s common stock, claimed risky
investments in subprime mortgages caused them to lose money.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  bought Bear Stearns in March 2008 when
the firm was on the brink of failing.  The parties engaged in mediation in October 2009 and
pursued negotiations in telephone conferences through the end of
last year, the investors said in court papers seeking approval
for the agreement. They said the settlement may equal 10 percent
to 28 percent of the losses to the stock ownership plan.  The case is In re Bear Stearns Cos. Securities, Derivative
and ERISA Litigation, 09-MDL-1963, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
