Three blasts were heard at the site
of the house of the man suspected of killing a teacher and three
children at a Jewish school and three soldiers.  The man has been holed up in a Toulouse apartment block
surrounded by police for almost 21 hours. Each blast was
accompanied by an orange light.  French special forces, which encircled the building complex
at 3:00 a.m. today, were told by the 23-year-old man that he may
give himself up this evening, Francois Molins, the Paris state
prosecutor overseeing the investigation, had said at a press
conference.  As night fell, the area around the building was plunged
into darkness with all lights turned out. The suspect, Mohammed
Merah, is a French national of Algerian descent, who claims to
have ties to al-Qaeda and spent time on the Afghanistan-Pakistan
border.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
