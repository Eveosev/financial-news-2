Dutch Finance Minister Jan Kees  de Jager  rejected a proposed financial-transaction tax as
inefficient and requested the European Commission to study
alternatives.  While the Dutch government subscribes to the goal of a
transaction tax, the current proposal doesn’t contribute to
financial stability and will hurt the Dutch pension sector, De
Jager wrote in a letter to parliament today.  The Netherlands would be hit hard by the levy because of
the size of its financial industry, the Dutch central bank said
last month. The tax would lead to annual costs of 2 billion
euros ($2.7 billion) for banks, 1.7 billion euros for pension
funds and 300 million euros for insurers, it said.  The European Commission, the European Union’s regulatory
arm, has proposed a wide-ranging tax on trading of stocks,
bonds, derivatives and other financial contracts. European
finance ministers are divided on the tax, with  France , one of
the main backers of the levy, saying it will allow more time to
reach an accord.  To contact the reporter on this story:
