Consumption will become  China ’s top
economic-growth driver in 2012 for the first time in almost 10
years, Xinhua News Agency reported, citing a research institute
under the Ministry of Commerce.  Contribution to gross domestic product from consumption
will surpass that of investment this year, Xinhua said, citing
the report from the Chinese Academy of International Trade and
Economic Cooperation. Still, growth in retail sales will be
slower than last year’s 17 percent, Xinhua reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
