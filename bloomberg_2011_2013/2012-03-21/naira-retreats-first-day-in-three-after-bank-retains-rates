Nigeria ’s naira depreciated for the
first time in three days on concern that rising government
spending could trigger accelerating inflation even after the
 central bank  held its benchmark interest rate at a record high.  The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer depreciated
0.1 percent to 157.65 per dollar as of 12:55 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  left the key interest rate at a
record 12 percent yesterday for a third consecutive meeting.
Lawmakers voted on March 15 to raise budgeted spending to about
4.9 trillion naira this year, 300 billion naira more than
proposed by Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. The lawmakers
also agreed to raise the benchmark oil price on which the budget
is based to $72 a barrel from $70, giving the government more
revenue to spend.  “Loose fiscal policy remains a concern given its liquidity
and confidence implications,”  Samir Gadio , an emerging-markets
strategist at Standard Bank Group Ltd. in  London , said in an e-
mailed response to questions. “Although the central bank
considered the possibility of a cut in the policy rate, we think
the fiscal distortion convinced the regulator that the time is
not yet right to start easing policy.”  Inflation (NGCPIYOY)  in the West African country declined to 11.9
percent in February from 12.6 percent a month earlier, the
National Bureau of Statistics said March 19.  Ghana’s cedi depreciated less than 0.1 percent to 1.7603
per dollar as of 10:25 a.m. in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
