Five-time National Basketball
Association champion  Derek Fisher  made his debut for the
Oklahoma City Thunder less than a week after he was traded from
the  Los Angeles Lakers  to the Houston Rockets.  Fisher, a 37-year-old guard who is the president of the NBA
Players Association, scored five points in 19 minutes as the
Thunder defeated the visiting Los Angeles Clippers 114-91 last
night.  Oklahoma City leads the NBA’s Western Conference with a 35-
12 record.  “I’m not here to tell them what to do, they seem to be
doing pretty well already,” Fisher told reporters before the
game. “I’m here to offer nuggets of wisdom, advice, the things
I’ve been through.”  Before last night Fisher, who was part of five NBA
championship teams with the Lakers, averaged 8.7 points and 3.1
assists in 1,153 regular-season games. He has also had stints
with the Golden State Warriors and  Utah Jazz  in his 16 NBA
seasons and is one of 10 active NBA players with more than
10,000 points, 3,500 assists and 1,200 steals.  “His experience and abilities will make a positive impact
with our team,” Thunder General Manager Sam Presti said in an
e-mailed team release. “He’s someone that will enhance our
roster’s current and future development on and off the floor.”  The Lakers traded Fisher and a first-round draft pick on
March 16 to Houston in exchange for forward Jordan Hill. Fisher
then reached a buyout agreement with the Rockets and became a
free agent.  Kevin Durant  led the Thunder with 32 points, nine rebounds
and five assists last night.  To contact the reporter on this story:
