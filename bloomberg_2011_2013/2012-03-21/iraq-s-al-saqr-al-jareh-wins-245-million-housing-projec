Iraq ’s al-Saqr al-Jareh company won
a $245 million contract to build 1,857 housing units in the
southern region of Basra, said Khalaf al-Badran, president of
the Basra Investment Commission.  The project will be built within five years on the northern
outskirts of Basra city, al-Badran said in a telephone interview
from Basra yesterday. Basra province needs 200,000 residential
units, he said.  Iraq, which holds the world’s fifth-largest oil reserves,
is seeking foreign investment to help rebuild an economy and
infrastructure damaged by years of conflict, sanctions and
underinvestment. In March 2010, the government approved plans to
build 1 million apartments by 2014 for lower- and middle-income
families to reduce the housing shortage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
