Chevron Corp. (CVX)  was found to have
miscalculated the pressure to drill a Brazilian offshore well
that spilled oil into the Atlantic Ocean in November,  O Globo 
reported, citing undisclosed people with knowledge of a probe by
the country’s petroleum regulator.  A report on the spill at Chevron’s Frade project is under
final revision by the ANP, as the agency is known, the Rio de
Janeiro-based newspaper said.  The ANP’s press office declined to comment on the report
when contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
