Kenya ’s  National Social Security
Fund , the country’s biggest investor in the  Nairobi Securities
Exchange (NSEASI) , said it’s planning a real-estate venture to build as
many as 30,000 residential units near the capital, Nairobi.  “We would like to partner through a joint venture with
international bodies, who are willing to invest in Kenya,” Tom
Odongo, acting head of the state-run company, told reporters
today in the city.  NSSF, as the company is known, is currently evaluating bids
from an international tender and further details will be
announced when that process is completed, Odongo said.
Previously the NSSF, which has 110 billion shillings ($1.32
billion), or about 30 percent of its total portfolio, invested
in property, has built 5,000 housing units.  To contact the reporter on this story:
