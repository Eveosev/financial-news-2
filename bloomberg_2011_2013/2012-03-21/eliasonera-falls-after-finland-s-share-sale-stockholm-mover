TeliaSonera AB (TLSN) ,  Sweden ’s largest
telephone operator, fell the most in seven months in Stockholm
trading after the Finnish state sold shares in the company as
well as bonds exchangeable for TeliaSonera stock.  TeliaSonera dropped as much as 4.3 percent to 45.45 kronor,
the biggest intraday drop since Aug. 18. The stock traded 3.5
percent down at 45.79 kronor as of 10:13 a.m.  Solidium, a company wholly-owned by the Finnish state,
today sold 89 million TeliaSonera shares in a bookbuilding
process at 45.20 kronor a share, it said in a statement.
Solidium will receive 451 million euros ($600 million) from the
sale. The stake represents about 2.1 percent of the shares of
Stockholm-based TeliaSonera, which was created when the former
state-owned phone companies Telia AB and Sonera Oyj were merged.  Solidium also placed 600 million euros of bonds that can be
exchanged for TeliaSonera shares at an initial exchange price of
57.63 kronor. If all bonds are exchanged, Solidium’s stake in
TeliaSonera would decrease to 9.5 percent. Before the sales, it
was about 13.7 percent, Solidium said.  “I am very satisfied with the successful execution of this
important transaction, which is a step in diversifying
Solidium’s portfolio,” said Solidium Managing Director Kari Jarvinen. “Demand for Solidium’s high-quality credit in
combination with a liquid underlying stock allowed us to price
the exchangeable bond at very attractive terms.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
