Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group Plc. (JLT) ,
a global insurance broking company, is interested in expanding
its activities in Croatia as the government prepares the sale of
state-owned  Croatia Osiguranje d.d.   “We as insurance brokers are very interested in the sale
of Croatia Osiguranje, as it may open more opportunity for us to
explore this market for our clients,” Andrew Webster, a partner
at JLT group, said in an interview at the British Investment
Forum in Zagreb today.  Finance Minister Slavko Linic said in January that the
government will hold a tender by the end of April for a majority
stake in Croatia Osiguranje. JLT group is the insurance broker
for Zadar-based tanker fleet operator  Tankerska Plovidba d.d.   To contact the reporter on this story:
