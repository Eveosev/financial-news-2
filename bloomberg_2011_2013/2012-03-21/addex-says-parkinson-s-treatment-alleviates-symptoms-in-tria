Addex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (ADXN)  said
its experimental treatment for  Parkinson’s disease  reduced
symptoms and was safe in a mid-stage patient study.  In a trial involving 76 Parkinson’s patients, dipraglurant
showed a statistically significant reduction in the involuntary
movements linked with the most widely used drug to treat the
disease, Geneva-based Addex said in a statement after the close
of trading today.  The drug also met its safety targets in the trial, Addex
said.  Addex said today it’s changing its name to Addex
Therapeutics. The switch has to be approved by shareholders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
