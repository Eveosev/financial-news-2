Taiwan’s government bonds and the
local dollar were little changed before the central bank meets
tomorrow to discuss borrowing costs.  Policy makers will leave the  discount rate  on 10-day loans
unchanged at 1.875 percent, according to all 11 economists in a
Bloomberg survey. The island’s export orders rose 17.6 percent
last month from a year earlier after slumping 8.63 percent in
January, government data showed yesterday.  “The rate meeting is keeping traders on the sidelines,”
said Ivy Leung, a Taipei-based bond trader at Polaris Securities
Co. “The good export numbers show the economy should be
steadily gaining steam.”  The yield on the government’s 1.25 percent bonds due March
2022 was steady at 1.295 percent, according to Gretai Securities
Market. It reached 1.30 percent on March 15, the highest level
for a benchmark 10-year note since Jan. 6, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The Ministry of Finance will release its second-quarter
debt-auction plan on March 23.  Taiwan ’s dollar weakened 0.06 percent to NT$29.576 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings that
traders use to price options, was little changed at 4.5 percent.  The overnight  money-market  rate was steady at 0.398
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
