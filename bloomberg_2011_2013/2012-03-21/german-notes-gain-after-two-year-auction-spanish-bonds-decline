Spanish bonds fell, pushing 10-year
yields to the highest level in a month, after Citigroup Inc.
chief economist  Willem Buiter  said the nation faced an
increasing risk of a debt restructuring.  Ten-year Spanish securities slid for an eighth day,
widening the extra yield over similar-maturity German bunds to
the most in two weeks. German  two-year notes  advanced for a
second day after the government sold 5 billion euros ($6.61
billion) of the securities. Portugal’s bonds gained as borrowing
costs fell at its first debt auction in more than a month.  “Spanish spreads moved much wider after Buiter’s
comments,” said Lyn Graham-Taylor, a fixed-income strategist at
Rabobank International in London. “This highlights concern over
further debt restructuring. Bunds recovered on the resulting
safe-haven demand.”  The Spanish  10-year yield  jumped 18 basis points, or 0.18
percentage point, to 5.41 percent at 4:30 p.m.  London  time, the
highest since Feb. 16. The 5.85 percent bonds maturing in
January 2022 dropped 1.38, or 13.80 euros per 1,000-euro face
amount, to 103.275. The two-year yield climbed 10 basis points
to 2.45 percent.  The extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year Spanish
bonds instead of similar-maturity German bunds expanded 23 basis
points to 342 basis points, the widest since March 7.  Spain  is at “a greater risk than ever before” of a debt
restructuring, Buiter said in an interview with  Tom Keene  and
Ken Prewitt on Bloomberg Radio. “Spain is the key country about
which I’m most worried.” The country has “moved to the wrong
side of the spectrum,” he said.  Most Volatile  Volatility in Spanish government debt was the highest in
euro-area markets today, followed by  Portugal , according to
measures of 10-year bonds, two- and 10-year yield spreads and
credit-default swaps.  German 10-year yields dropped from a three-month high
following the today’s note auction.  The nation sold 5 billion euros of debt due in March 2014
at an average yield of 0.31 percent, compared with 0.25 percent
at the prior auction on Feb. 22. Investors bid for 1.8 times the
amount allotted, the same as the previous sale. The nation also
sold 2 billion euros of inflation-linked bonds.  ‘Solid’ Demand  “Demand was solid with total bids for 7.25 billion euros”
at the German sale, said Annalisa Piazza, a fixed-income analyst
at Newedge Group in London. “The auction was well received and
this is filtering through to the secondary market.”  Germany ’s two-year yield dropped four basis points to 0.3
percent. The 10-year yield fell six basis points to 1.98 percent
after rising to 2.07 percent, the highest level since Dec. 13.  Portuguese two-year notes advanced for a fifth day as
borrowing costs declined at a bill auction.  Portugal sold 1.61 billion euros of one-year bills at an
average yield of 3.65 percent, down from 4.94 percent at the
previous offering on Feb. 15. Investors bid for 2.5 times the
amount allotted, versus a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.02 times last
month. The nation also sold 382 million euros of 119-day debt.  The two-year yield fell 75 basis points to 11.34 percent.  Dutch Bonds  The extra yield investors demand to hold Dutch bonds
instead of German bunds widened after an independent agency said
the Netherland’s budget deficit may increase.  The Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis said
the shortfall would exceed the European Union’s target of 3
percent. The agency said the 2013 deficit would be 4.6 percent,
revised from 4.5 percent.  “The market is worried about the Dutch ability to reduce
its deficit,” said Alessandro Giansanti, a senior rates
strategist at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam. “There’s a thin
majority in parliament and the risks for a political crisis are
elevated. A political impasse could drive rating actions in the
future.”  The Dutch 10-year yield fell two basis points to 2.52
percent, after rising to 2.62 percent, the most since Dec. 7.
The spread between Dutch 10-year bonds and similar-maturity
German bunds expanded three basis points to 54 basis points.  The European Financial Stability Facility sold 4 billion
euros of bonds maturing in May 2017 at 38 basis points more than
the benchmark swap rate, giving an implied yield of 2.061
percent. The sale “met with strong demand with orders received
of approximately 12.8 billion euros,” the EFSF said.  German Futures  German two-year note futures may fall to a three-month low
should they break below a key level of so-called support, UBS AG
said, citing trading patterns.  The contracts “are bearish while they trade below the
110.15 retracement,”  Richard Adcock , head of fixed-income
technical strategy at UBS in London, wrote in a research note.
“A break below 109.98 will be the next bearish trigger,
exposing the market to 109.86, the Dec. 7 low.”  The two-year note contract due in June rose 0.1 percent to
110.14. Support refers to an area on a graph where technical
analysts anticipate buy orders to be grouped.  German bonds handed investors a loss of 1.1 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
securities gained 1.9 percent, and Portuguese debt climbed 5.7
percent, the data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
