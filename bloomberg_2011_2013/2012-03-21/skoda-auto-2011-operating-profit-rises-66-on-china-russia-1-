Skoda Auto AS, the Czech unit of
 Volkswagen AG (VOW) , said its operating profit rose 66 percent last
year, boosted by demand in  India , Russia and  China .  Operating profit ion 2011 totaled 743 million euros ($985
million) from 447 million euros a year earlier, the Mlada
Boleslav, Czech Republic-based company said in a statement
handed out to reporters in  Prague  today. Revenue rose 18.1
percent to 10.3 billion euros.  Skoda’s world market share of the automobile market grew to
more than 1.4 percent last year as it delivered 879,200 cars
during 2011, up 15.3 percent from the year before, company
executives said today at a press conference. Skoda’s board is
likely to propose a dividend of about 7.1 billion koruna ($382
million) from 2011 profit, it said.  “The environment for our business has recently cooled
slightly, especially in some markets in  Europe ,” Chief
Executive Officer Winfried Vahland said at the press conference.
“The overall picture remains positive and we’re cautiously
optimistic regarding the years ahead.” Skoda expects to
continue to grow in all its regions, Vahland said.  Skoda Auto, purchased by Volkswagen AG shortly after the
fall of communism in 1989, aims to grow twice as fast as its
parent. The carmaker reiterated today its target to deliver 1.5
million units annually by 2018 by providing new models and on
rising demand in India, China and Russia.  Last year, Skoda rolled out its Citigo car in the  Czech
Republic  and started to offer the Skoda Rapid model in India. It
will present a European version this year.  In  Russia , Skoda’s fastest growing European market, the
carmaker’s 2011 sales rose 63 percent to 74,100 units from a
year ago, Skoda said. In China, which continues to be the
company’s largest market, sales advanced 22 percent to 220,100
units, it said. India, where sales rose almost 50 percent is a
“growth market par excellence.”  Skoda, whose deliveries rose 11.6 percent from a year ago,
expects a “good” first quarter, Vahland said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
