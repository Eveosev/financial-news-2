Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo said Deutsche Bank AG’s change in the legal structure
for its U.S. unit in response to new  capital requirements  has
influenced how he views regulation of financial institutions
based outside the U.S.  “As I think about the appropriate modes of regulation and
supervision of foreign banking organizations in the U.S., the
development to which you just alluded has certainly affected my
thinking about how we do structure regulation of foreign banking
organizations,” Tarullo said today in testimony to the Senate
Banking Committee. His comments were in response to a question
on the implications of Deutsche Bank’s change for government
authority in winding down failing institutions.  “I think we will need to respond to that,” Tarullo said,
without elaborating on any possible response or on how the
bank’s actions influenced his thinking. After the hearing he
declined to comment further.  The Wall Street Journal reported that the Frankfurt-based
bank on Feb. 1 reorganized its U.S. subsidiary, known as Taunus
Corp., to skirt new regulations that would have required the
firm to inject new capital into the U.S. division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
