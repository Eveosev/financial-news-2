Henderson Land Development Co. (12) , the
Hong Kong builder controlled by billionaire Lee Shau-kee, said
 2011 underlying profit  rose 10 percent on higher rental income
and contributions from unit Hong Kong &  China  Gas Co.  Profit excluding property revaluation gains and deferred
taxes rose to HK$5.6 billion ($721 million), or HK$2.41 a share,
in the 12 months ended Dec. 31, from HK$5.04 billion, or HK$2.33,
the company said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange
today. That compares with a median HK$6.1 billion estimate of
five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Gross rental income at the company rose 11 percent to a
record in 2011 as the influx of tourists from other parts of
China and expansion by financial companies fueled growth in
retail and office properties.  Henderson Land  last year didn’t
start selling any new residential projects in Hong Kong, where
 home prices  and transactions fell in the second half because of
rising mortgage rates and curbs imposed by the government to
prevent the formation of an asset bubble.  “The project launches in 2012 should see a better-than-
expected selling pace and price” for Henderson Land, Citigroup
Inc. Hong Kong-based analyst Ken Yeung wrote in a March 18
report. Yeung forecast the company to sell more than 3,700 units
this year as the home market recovers.  Henderson Land, the city’s fourth-biggest builder by value,
in 2011 sold a total of 812 units in the city in projects
including Beverly Hill and Casa Marina for HK$16.2 billion,
accounting for about 9 percent of total residential units sold
in  Hong Kong , according to data compiled by Centaline Property
Agency Ltd.  Henderson Land rose 0.1 percent to close at HK$46.05 in
Hong Kong today before the earnings were announced. The stock
has dropped 15 percent this year, matching the retreat in the
seven-member Hang Seng Property Index of which it is a member.  To contact the reporters on this story:
