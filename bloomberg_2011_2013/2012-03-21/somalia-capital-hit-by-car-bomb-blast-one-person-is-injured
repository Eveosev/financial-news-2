A car bomb exploded in central
Mogadishu, the Somali capital, injuring at least one person,
witnesses and police officials said.  A vehicle parked in Makka al-Mukarama Road, which connects
the cityâ€™s airport to the presidential palace, detonated after
police cleared the vicinity, Mohamed Muse, a stationary seller
in the area, said in an interview today.  Police evacuated the area after receiving a tipoff from
residents about a suspicious vehicle being parked on the
pavement in Makka al-Mukarama Road, Captain Ahmed Farhere, a
government security officer, said in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
