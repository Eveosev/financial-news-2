Norway ’s  unemployment rate  fell in
the January quarter as the strengthening krone weighed on
exporters.  The country’s jobless rate fell to 3.2 percent from 3.3
percent in the December quarter, Oslo-based  Statistics Norway 
said today. The median forecast of nine economists in a survey
was for 3.3 percent.  Norway,  Europe ’s second-largest gas exporter, has withstood
the region’s debt crisis as higher petroleum prices spur record
investments this year in offshore oil and gas fields.  The central bank cut its benchmark interest rate for a
second consecutive meeting last week to 1.5 percent in an effort
to check gains in the krone that are hurting exporters. The
krone jumped to a nine-year high against the euro this month.  Companies such as  Renewable Energy Corp. ASA (REC) , a maker of
solar energy components, have announced job cuts as the strong
currency hurts competitiveness and demand wanes from debt-
burdened Europe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
