Philippine bonds dropped, pushing
yields to a four-month high, on speculation the central bank
will halt interest-rate cuts on signs the economy is recovering.
The peso strengthened.  The  World Bank  said this week the Philippine economy may
grow 4.2 percent in 2012 and 5 percent in 2013, compared with
3.7 percent last year. Exports unexpectedly rose in January
after eight months of declines, official data showed March 13.
The central bank has reduced the  overnight borrowing rate  by 50
basis points this year to 4 percent, with the next review due
April 19.  “The local economy is recovering and that means the
central bank won’t continue with rate cuts,” said  Ju Wang , an
emerging-markets fixed-income strategist at  Barclays Capital  in
Singapore. “Near term, you might see yields going higher.”  The yield on the 6.375 percent bond due January 2022
increased 10 basis points to 5.75 percent as of 10:05 a.m. in
 Manila , prices from Tradition Financial Services show. That’s
the highest level since Nov. 17. Yields have increased 50 basis
points this week.  Philippine 10-year bonds yielded 342 basis points, or 3.42
percentage points, more that similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s down from 492
basis points on Sept. 23, the widest since July 2010.  “Given the smaller spread against U.S. Treasuries, local
bonds are less attractive from a foreigners’ perspective for
now,” Wang said.  Shipments abroad climbed 3 percent from a year earlier to
$4.1 billion after a revised 18.9 percent fall in December. The
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey was for an 18.5
percent decline.  The peso advanced 0.1 percent to 43.028 per dollar,
according to Tullett Prebon Plc. One-month implied volatility,
which measures exchange-rate swings used to price options, was
steady at 6.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
