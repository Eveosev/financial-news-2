Treasury 10-year notes fell,
snapping yesterday’s first gain in two weeks, before an industry
report that economists said will show U.S. home sales rose the
most in almost two years.  Investors should bet against 10-year Treasury futures
contracts, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a report. Federal
Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Narayana Kocherlakota said
he sees the central bank beginning to withdraw monetary stimulus
in 2012 or 2013 if the economy meets his forecast.  “People are starting to realize that there is gradual
growth in the economy,” said Kei Katayama, who invests in U.S.
bonds at Daiwa SB Investments Ltd., which oversees the
equivalent of $59.2 billion including  Asia ’s second-largest
mutual fund. “I’m concerned that there’s a global bond bubble.
Maybe not within a week or a month, but there’s a risk that
yields will rise globally.”  Ten-year  yields  increased two basis points to 2.38 percent
as of 11:48 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader
prices. The 2 percent security due in February 2022 slid 5/32,
or $1.56 per $1,000 face amount, to 96 22/32. The rate declined
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, yesterday.  Japan ’s 10-year yield increased two basis points to 1.05
percent, the biggest increase in almost a week.  Housing Data  U.S. home purchases climbed 0.9 percent in February from
January to a 4.61 million annual rate, the most since  May 2010 (ETSLTOTL) ,
according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News before the National Association of Realtors
reports the figure today.  The housing industry, which struggled to pick up for most
of the economic expansion, is improving as the U.S. adds jobs
and cheaper homes keep  affordability  at a record.  Goldman Sachs reiterated its view that investors should
“short,” or bet against, 10-year Treasury futures, according
to a report yesterday by Fiona Lake, an economist for the New
York-based company. Goldman, one of the 21 primary dealers that
underwrite the  U.S. debt , initiated the recommendation on March
14 at a price of 129 17/32 with a target of 126.  Ten-year futures contracts for June delivery were little
changed today at 127 30/32.  Kocherlakota said yesterday the central bank may start to
withdraw monetary stimulus as soon as 2012 if the economy meets
his forecast, including an inflation rate of 2 percent or higher
during the next two years.  The Fed’s policy committee reiterated in a March 13
statement the view that it will probably need to keep its
benchmark rate at almost zero at least through late 2014.  Treasuries rose yesterday, pushing 10-year yields down from
four-month highs and ending the nine-day decline that was the
longest run of losses since 2006.  The 14-day  relative strength index  for 10-year yields was
74.7 today, exceeding 70 for a sixth day. A reading above that
level indicates to some traders that a gain in the yields may be
hard to sustain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
