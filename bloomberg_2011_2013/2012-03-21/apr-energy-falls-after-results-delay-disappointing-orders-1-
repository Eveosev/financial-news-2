APR Energy Plc (APR) , a supplier of
temporary power generators, fell to a record in London trading
after delaying 2011 results and missing analyst estimates for
orders in the first quarter.  The shares plunged 20 percent to 884 pence, the lowest
since the stock began trading in February 2010.  APR yesterday postponed its earnings report for the 14
months through Dec. 31 to April 16 due to “complexities in
reporting and accounting for the various transactions.” It has
received 64 megawatts of new contracts this year, it said.  “The announced three-week delay in full-year and first
quarter order intake are both disappointing,” UBS AG analyst
Alexander Hugh said in a research note. “Management indicated
order intake would improve, but there has been a similar message
for the last six months.”  APR, which provides electricity generating equipment that
can back up existing grid capacity or create a dedicated supply,
merged with Horizon Acquisition Co. in a reverse takeover in
June. APR last year won contracts in  Japan  with Tokyo Electric
Power Co. following the biggest earthquake in Japan’s history.  To contact the reporter on this story:
