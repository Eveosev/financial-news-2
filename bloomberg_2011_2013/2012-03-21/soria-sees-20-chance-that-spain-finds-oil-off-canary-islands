Spanish Industry Minister Jose Manuel Soria said there’s a 20 percent chance that  Repsol YPF SA (REP) 
will find oil beneath the Atlantic off the  Canary Islands .  Should the ocean bed prove to contain crude, it may produce
about 140,000 barrels a day for 20 years, Soria said in an
interview on Onda Cero radio station. “There is a high
probability,” he said. “We may finally find oil in  Spain .”  Repsol plans to drill two wells about 38 miles (61
kilometers) from the coast of Lanzarote and will ensure the
operations won’t affect tourist beaches, spokesman Kristian Rix
said.  The wells could cover about 10 percent of Spain’s demand
for crude, Soria said. The country currently imports 98 percent
of the fossil hydrocarbons that it requires. The regional
government of the Canaries opposes the plans, arguing that it
threatens tourism, El Mundo newspaper reported yesterday.  “Repsol applies the highest standards to all its
operations in 30 countries,” Rix said in a phone interview.
“We are especially interested in making a Spanish project a
success.”  The Spanish government last week passed a law approving
Repsol’s drilling plans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
