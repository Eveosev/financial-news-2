Air Arabia PJSC (AIRARABI) , the Middle East’s
biggest discount airline, is adding aircraft to its bases in

added a jet in Alexandria, Egypt and is deploying another this
year at its Moroccan base in Casablanca to operate European
routes, Chief Executive Officer Adel Ali said in an interview.

region will see some growth,” Ali yesterday in Dubai. “I’m sure
we’ll see growth quarter-to-quarter in passenger numbers.”  Air Arabia, which operates Airbus SAS A320 single-aisle
jets, has taken delivery of one aircraft this year and will get
five more, the CEO said. airline has a fleet of 30 planes with
35 yet to be delivered through 2015-2016. Some 44 A320s have
been ordered in total, with a list price of $3.6 billion.  The discount carrier, which competes with government-owned
