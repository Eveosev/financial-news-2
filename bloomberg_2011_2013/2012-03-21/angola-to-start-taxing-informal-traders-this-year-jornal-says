Angola  will start taxing informal
traders this year to boost income from outside the oil industry,
 Jornal de Angola  reported, citing Finance Minister Carlos Alberto Lopes.  A “greater percentage” of the economy in sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s second-biggest oil producer is informal and traders
must formalize some of their activities to enable the government
to collect taxes, the Luanda-based newspaper said.  Taxes in the southern African nation may decline as the
country broadens its tax base, Lopes said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
