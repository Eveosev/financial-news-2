Repsol YPF SA (REP) , the Spanish oil
producer with 16 percent of its business in  Argentina , rose the
most in four months in  Madrid  after an Argentine official said
the government doesn’t plan to nationalize its local unit.  Repsol jumped as much as 6.2 percent, the biggest intraday
gain since Nov. 8, and traded up 4.4 percent at 20.115 euros as
of 1:49 p.m. local time.  Argentina isn’t seeking to nationalize Repsol’s  YPF SA , the
country’s biggest energy company, Cabinet Chief Juan Manuel Abal Medina said yesterday in an interview on Radio Continental. His
comments eased weeks of speculation that the government may take
over YPF in a dispute over oil output. Abal later said no action
had been ruled out, according to state-run news agency Telam.  YPF said this week it may cut dividends after three
Argentine provinces revoked its licenses and the government said
it should boost investment in production. The company had
announced Feb. 9 an increase in shale-oil resources at its Vaca
Muerta formations in southern Argentina to as much as 23 billion
barrels from previous forecasts of about 927 million barrels.  The government said that month it would take the “most
vigorous measures” against YPF if it fails to meet domestic
fuel demand.  To contact the reporterS on this story:
