Early elections in the German state
of North Rhine-Westphalia may put the state at risk of missing
deadlines in the restructuring of  WestLB AG (WESTLB) ,  Sueddeutsche
Zeitung  reported, citing an interview with  Joaquin Almunia , the
European Union antitrust commissioner.  The mid-May elections may make it difficult for a new
government to make payments due in the restructuring by June 30,
the newspaper cited Alumnia as saying in an e-mailed preview of
a story to be published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
