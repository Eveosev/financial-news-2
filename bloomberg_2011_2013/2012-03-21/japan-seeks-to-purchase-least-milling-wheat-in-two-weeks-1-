Japan  is seeking to buy 133,792
metric tons of milling wheat from the U.S.,  Canada  and  Australia 
in a regular tender on March 23, the smallest volume in two
weeks, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said.  The Australian wheat is for loading from May 1 to May 31,
Toshiki Tojo at the ministry’s grain-trade division said today
by phone. The Canadian wheat and part of the U.S. grain is for
arrival in Japan by June 30, he said. The remainder is for
shipment from April 21 to May 20. The volume sought is the
lowest since March 8, when the government bought 96,061 tons.  The ministry, which controls overseas purchases and
domestic sales to stabilize supply, is  Asia ’s largest buyer as a
single entity. It has bought 4.52 million tons through regular
tenders this fiscal year, compared with 5.16 million tons in the
year ended March 31. Details of this week’s tender are listed
