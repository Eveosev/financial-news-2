Quarterback Alex Smith reached
agreement on a new contract with the  San Francisco 49ers  after
Peyton Manning signed with the  Denver Broncos ,  NFL.com reported ,
citing a person familiar with the negotiations.  The 49ers had given Manning a tryout before the four-time
National Football League Most Valuable Player opted to join the
Broncos. Smith, a free agent, had visited the Miami Dolphins to
discuss a move there, NFL.com said last night.  San Francisco spokesman Bob Lange did not immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the NFL.com report.  Smith, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2005 draft, last
season completed 273 passes for 3,144 yards, both career highs,
and 17 touchdowns as the 49ers reached the playoffs for the
first time since the 2002 season. He threw five interceptions.  Smith, 27, led the 49ers to a 13-3 record in winning the
National Football Conference Western Division last season. They
lost 20-17 to the  New York Giants  in overtime in the NFC
championship game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
