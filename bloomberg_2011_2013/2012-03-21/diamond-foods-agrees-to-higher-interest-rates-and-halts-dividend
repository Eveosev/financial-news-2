Diamond Foods Inc. (DMND) , the maker of
Emerald snack nuts and Kettle Chips, reached an agreement with
its lenders to keep its  credit line  open until June 18 in
exchange for paying higher  interest rates .  Diamond announced the forbearance agreement today in a
 regulatory filing . The San Francisco-based company said it will
be charged 75 basis points more on its credit line, pay a one-
time fee of 25 basis points and suspend dividend payments to
stockholders. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage
point.  Agreeing to accept the new terms on its credit line kept
creditors from declaring all balances due and payable
immediately, the company said in the filing.  Diamond is restructuring its debt after its February
announcement that it had reported some costs for walnuts in the
wrong quarters violated some covenants. The company replaced its
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, and an
agreement to buy Pringles potato chips from  Procter & Gamble Co .
was lost.  Diamond was little changed in extended trading after the
announcement. The shares had risen 2.4 percent to $25.64 at the
regular New York close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
