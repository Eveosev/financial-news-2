Belarus plans to cut Russian
natural-gas imports after starting its first nuclear power plant
in 2017.  The former Soviet republic will need to burn only half the
amount of gas it does now for electricity, saving 5 billion
cubic meters of the fuel annually or almost a quarter of
imports, Deputy Energy Minister Mikhail Mikhadiuk said today
during a conference on nuclear energy in the capital, Minsk.  Belarus imports about 22 billion cubic meters of gas a
year, of which half is used to produce electricity, he said.  Belarus expects its first nuclear power plant to become
fully operational in 2018 or 2019, First Deputy Prime Minister
Vladimir Semashko said at the conference. “The first unit of
the nuclear facility will be started in 2017, the second unit
one or two years later.”  Russia agreed to provide Belarus with a $10 billion export
loan, covering 85 percent of the generator’s total cost,
Semashko said. The two countries, which formed a customs union
with  Kazakhstan , will allocate $170 million this year to
complete the initial phase of construction, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
