Spain â€™s government is looking at
taking equity stakes in unprofitable toll roads,  Cinco Dias 
reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.  The government may use a state-controlled transport
infrastructure company known as Seittsa to take the stakes, the
newspaper said.  The government may buy shares of the M-12 road in the
Madrid region, which is operated by  Obrascon Huarte Lain SA (OHL) , and
of the AP-41 highway between Madrid and Toledo, which is managed
by a group including Isolux Corsa, Cinco said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
