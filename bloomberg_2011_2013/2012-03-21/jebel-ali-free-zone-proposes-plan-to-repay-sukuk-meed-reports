Jebel Ali Free Zone FZE, a business
park operator in Dubai, put forward a fundraising plan to help
repay a 7.5 billion-dirham ($2 billion) Islamic bond maturing in
November, MEED reported, citing people it didnâ€™t identify.  The state-controlled company proposed reducing debt by 700
million dirhams, raising a loan of about 4 billion dirhams and
selling an Islamic bond or sukuk of about 2.4 billion dirhams,
MEED reported on its website. The new financing is likely to be
in place by July, with involvement by Citigroup Inc.,  Standard
Chartered Plc (STAN)  and  Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB) , MEED said. Jebel Ali
will raise the loan first, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
