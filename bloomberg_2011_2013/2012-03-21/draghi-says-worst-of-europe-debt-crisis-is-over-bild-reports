European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi  said the worst of the sovereign debt crisis is
over,  Germany ’s Bild newspaper reported, citing an interview.  “The worst is over, but there are still risks,” Draghi
was quoted as saying. “The situation has stabilized. The
important indicators for the  euro zone , like inflation, current
account and above all the budget deficits, are better than, for
example, in the United States.”  Investor confidence has returned and “the ball is now with
governments,” Draghi said, according to Bild. “They must
sustainably secure the euro zone against crises.”  Draghi also said Germany is a “role model” in  Europe , and
the ECB’s 23-member Governing Council, which contains two
Germans, has “internalized” Germany’s stability culture, Bild
reported. Draghi shares Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann’s
concerns about the risks the ECB has taken and there is no
north-south divide on the council, the newspaper said.  If the inflation outlook worsens, the ECB “will
immediately act pre-emptively,” Draghi said, according to Bild.
However, if oil and tax increases are taken into account,
inflation remains stable at around 1.5 percent, he said. The
ECB’s lending to banks won’t fuel inflation, Draghi was quoted
as saying.  To contact the reporters on this story:
