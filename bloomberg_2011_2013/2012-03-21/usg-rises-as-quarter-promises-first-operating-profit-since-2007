USG Corp. (USG) , the wallboard maker
whose largest shareholder is Warren Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A) , rose to a one-year high after indicating it may achieve
its first quarterly operating profit since 2007.   USG climbed 11 percent to $19 at the close in  New York ,
the highest level since February 2011.  Eagle Materials Inc. (EXP) , a
wallboard and cement maker, and  Masco Corp. (MAS) , producer of faucets
and kitchen cabinets, also jumped after USG said sales gained 16
percent in the first two months this year.  The Chicago-based company said wallboard prices rose in
January and February, suggesting the industry is rebounding
after a housing crisis caused new  home construction  to plummet
in the past years, slashing demand for the product. Housing
starts in the U.S. hovered in February near a three-year high
and building permits rose.  “New housing starts, existing home sales and an increase
in the NAHB’s homebuilder confidence index all suggest that the
housing market is experiencing a nascent recovery,” Robert C. Wetenhall, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets LLC, said in a
report today. USG may gain the most from the rebound because of
rising wallboard prices, he said.  USG reported preliminary operating profit of $5.7 million
for January and February, compared with an operating loss a year
earlier of $46.8 million. March results also “will reflect the
continuing impact” of price and margin increases, USG said in a
statement yesterday after the markets closed. The company has
posted operating losses every quarter since the end of 2007.  Eagle Materials, based in  Dallas , climbed 2.8 percent to
$35.81, while Masco, a Taylor, Michigan-based company, advanced
3.6 percent to $14.10. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.2
percent.  High-Risk Appetite  USG said sales for January and February rose to $516.9
million from $446.9 million a year earlier. USG released the
preliminary figures in connection with a tender offer to redeem
$300 million of 9.75 percent notes. Full first-quarter results
will be reported April 17.  Wetenhall said he recommends USG stock to “aggressive
investors with a high risk appetite.”  Higher wallboard pricing during 2012 “represents an
exceptionally powerful tailwind,” Wetenhall said in the report.
“The stock will continue to work as long as year-over-year
wallboard pricing trends remain favorable.”  In the first quarter last year, the company had an
operating loss of $49 million and a net loss of $105 million, or
$1.01 a share.  Berkshire Hathaway  held  16.2 percent of USG’s outstanding
shares as of Dec. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
