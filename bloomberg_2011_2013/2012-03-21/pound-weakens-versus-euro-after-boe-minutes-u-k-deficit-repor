The pound weakened against the  euro 
and erased its gain against the dollar after the minutes of the
Bank of England’s March 7-8 meeting showed two policy makers
voted to add more stimulus to the economy.  Britain’s currency depreciated 0.4 percent to 83.67 pence
per euro at 9:35 a.m. London time. It was little changed at
$1.5854, after advancing as much as 0.4 percent to $1.5923.  Policy makers  Adam Posen  and David Miles wanted to increase
the target for bond purchases by 25 billion pounds to 350
billion pounds, the minutes showed. The seven remaining members
voted to keep the current 325 billion-pound target. The Monetary
Policy Committee also voted 9-0 to hold the benchmark  interest
rate  at 0.5 percent.  Britain’s budget deficit almost doubled in February as
taxes fell and spending surged, a separate report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
