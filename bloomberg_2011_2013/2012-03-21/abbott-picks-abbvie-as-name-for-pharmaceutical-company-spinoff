Abbott Laboratories (ABT) , the drug and
medical-device company that plans to split in two, said its
pharmaceutical spinoff will be called AbbVie and will debut by
the end of the year.  Abbott, which makes the autoimmune treatment Humira,
artery-clearing heart stents and nutritional drinks, announced
the name in a statement today. Richard Gonzalez will lead the
drugs business, the  Abbott Park , Illinois-based company has
already said.  Chief Executive Officer  Miles White  said in October that he
would divide the company, with Abbott retaining the devices,
nutritional drinks, generic drugs and other products that had
become overshadowed by Humira, which generated sales of $7.9
billion last year. The name of the branded-drug business,
pronounced “Abb-vee,” is derived from its parent company as
well as “vi,” the Latin root for “life,” Abbott said.  “The beginning of the name connects the new company to
Abbott and its heritage of pioneering science,” Gonzalez said
in the statement. “The ‘vie’ calls attention to the vital work
the company will continue to advance to improve the lives of
people around the world.”  AbbVie’s logo and “graphic identity” will be unveiled
when the new company is introduced, Abbott said in the
statement. White will remain chairman and CEO at the original
company while Gonzalez will fill those positions at the spinoff.  Abbott fell less than 1 percent to $60.39 at the close of
New York trading. The shares have gained  13 percent  since the
breakup was announced on Oct. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
