Zimbabwe Platinum Ltd. (ZIM) , known as
Zimplats, may face total nationalization if it doesn’t meet the
government’s two-week deadline for agreement on the value of a
stake in the company, the state-controlled Herald newspaper said
in an  editorial .  The Herald quoted an interview Zimplats Chairman  David Brown  gave to South Africa’s Mining Weekly magazine. Brown said
the Zimbabwean government would have to pay for a 31 percent
stake it is demanding in Zimplats, according to the Herald.
 Mining Weekly  put the value at between $500,000 and $1 million.  “It is not clear whether Mr. Brown or his advisers have
read the appropriate legislation that governs the evaluation
process in Zimbabwe,” the Herald said in the editorial, adding
that the value would be determined by the indigenization
minister and the mining company, taking into account the
“state’s sovereign ownership of the mineral.”  Neither Indigenization Minister  Saviour Kasukuwere  nor
Mines Minister Obert Mpofu answered calls seeking comment today.  Brown met Kasukuwere last week in Harare to negotiate a
transfer of shares to a national indigenization fund. The
negotiations haven’t ended, Brown said after the meeting.  Zimplats is a unit of South Africa’s  Impala Platinum
Holdings Ltd. (IMP)   To contact the reporter on this story:
