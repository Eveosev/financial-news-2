Wolfgang Hammes, the co-head of
European financial-institution  investment banking  at  Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK) , has left Germany’s biggest lender, according to two
people with knowledge of the matter.  Hammes, who was hired from  Merrill Lynch & Co. in  2005,
left for personal reasons, the people said, declining to be
identified because the details are private. A press officer for
Deutsche Bank declined to comment, and Hammes couldn’t be
reached.  Tadhg Flood, who co-heads the unit, will continue to run
the banking team that advises financial institutions including
insurers and reinsurers in  Europe , one of the people said.  Deutsche Bank ranks fifth in providing advice on global
financial-services mergers and acquisitions, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It advised the U.K. government on the
sale of lender Northern Rock Plc to billionaire  Richard
Branson ’s Virgin Money Holdings for 747 million pounds ($1.18
billion) in November.  It’s also one of four firms advising on the 750 million-
euro ($990 million) initial public offering this year of Talanx
AG, Germany’s third-biggest insurer, people with knowledge of
the plans have said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
