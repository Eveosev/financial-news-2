France’s conservative government is
striving for closer business ties with  Germany , Manager Magazin
reported, citing French Agriculture Minister Bruno Le Maire.  Siemens AG (SIE)  and  Areva SA (AREVA)  should cooperate on wind-power
turbines to help ward off competition from  China , and the two
countries should consider merging Germany’s state-owned railway
operator,  Deutsche Bahn AG (DBHN) , with its French SNCF counterpart,
the minister was cited as telling the magazine in its March 23
edition.  Le Maire is among French President Nicolas Sarkozy’s
closest allies and speaks fluent German, according to the
