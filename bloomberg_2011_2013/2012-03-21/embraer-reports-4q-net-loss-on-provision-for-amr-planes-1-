Embraer SA (EMBR3) , the world’s fourth
biggest planemaker, reported a net loss in the fourth quarter
after booking a provision for the possible return of planes from
AMR Corp. after the company sought Chapter 11 protection from
creditors in November.  Embraer’s net loss of 171.6 million reais ($94.6 million)
compares with a net profit of 208 million reais a year earlier,
and missed the average estimate for a net profit of 223 million
reais by three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The  Sao Jose dos
Campos , Brazil-based company posted a 0.237 loss per share,
compared with a 0.288 profit per share in the fourth quarter of
2010.  The company said it provisioned 662.6 million reais for
losses related to the possible return of 216 regional jets it
sold to AMR and are now operated by American Eagle,  American
Airlines Inc.’s (AMR1)  regional carrier. Of that total, 583.2 million
reais are directly related to the likely return of these
aircraft. The remaining 79.4 million reais are additional
provisions related to other regional jets from Embraer’s ERJ-145
family, including air planes operated by Mesa Air Group, which
filed for Chapter 11 in January 2010. The possible return of AMR
planes may lead to an oversupply on the used-plane market, which
led Embraer to increase provisions for the regional jets
operated by Mesa, according to the earnings statement.  “We expect this non-recurring provision to negatively
affect Embraer’s results,” wrote Banco Santander Brasil SA’s
analysts Alexandre Amson and Bruno Amorim in a note to clients
before the earnings release.  Net sales rose 9 percent to 3.67 billion reais in the
fourth quarter from 3.34 billion reais a year earlier. The
company delivered 82 commercial and business jets in the fourth
quarter. Embraer’s order backlog was at $15.4 billion at the end
of last year.  Embraer rose 16 percent this year, falling behind  Brazil ’s
benchmark Bovespa index 18.6 percent gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
