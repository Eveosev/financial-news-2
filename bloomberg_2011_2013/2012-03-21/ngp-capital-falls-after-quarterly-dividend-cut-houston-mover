NGP Capital Resources Co. (NGPC) , the
Houston-based fund that invests in energy companies, fell the
most in five months after cutting its dividend by a third
because of first-quarter earnings.  NGP dropped 7.8 percent to $6.74 at the close in New York,
the biggest decline since Oct. 3. Before today, the stock had
 risen  1.7 percent this year.  The company declared a 12 cents-a-share quarterly dividend
today, a decline from the 18 cents it distributed each quarter
of 2011.  The payout “closely matches our current earnings rate,”
Chief Executive Officer Steve Gardner said in a statement. “Our
earnings rate for the remainder of 2012 will improve as we
redeploy cash proceeds received in 2011.”  The stock has one buy recommendation and three holds from
analysts. NGP is managed by closely held NGP Investment Advisor
LP, an affiliate of Irving, Texas-based NGP Energy Capital
Management LLC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
