China Petrochemical Corp. (SINZ)  will
increase spending on shale-gas exploration and aims to account
for almost a third of the country’s 2015 target for extracting
the fuel from sedimentary rock, the  China Daily  reported.  The state-owned company known as Sinopec Group will invest
more than 1 billion yuan ($158 million) in developing shale gas
and oil areas this year and targets producing at least 2 billion
cubic meters (70.63 billion cubic feet) of the unconventional
gas by 2015, the Beijing-based newspaper reported, citing a
company official. That would amount to 31 percent of the
government’s national target of 6.5 billion cubic meters.  Sinopec Group,  Asia ’s biggest oil refiner, spent 600
million yuan on developing shale resources last year and expects
to produce 500 million to 1 billion cubic meters of shale gas by
2014, the report said, citing Bao Shujing, deputy manager of the
Unconventional Energy Technology Support Department of Sinopec
Group’s Petrochemical’s Petroleum Exploration and Development
Research Institute.  China  holds the largest reserves of the resource and has
yet to produce shale gas commercially as its explorers struggle
to overcome the lack of domestic drilling expertise and geology
that is tougher than in the U.S., where output has surged 15-
fold in the past decade. The country aims to ramp up output to
as much as and 100 billion cubic meters by 2020, the National
Development and Reform Commission  said  March 16, citing a plan
drafted by the National Energy Administration.  A “breakthrough” would be needed by the middle of this
decade for China to achieve its targets, the Energy
Administration said in its shale-gas plan for the five years
ending 2015. The goals announced last week matched estimates
issued by the Ministry of Land and Resources previously.  Approvals, Incentives  The government has pledged to prioritize land approvals for
shale-gas exploration, allow tax-free imports of equipment that
can’t be manufactured locally and offer subsidies to companies
including Sinopec Group,  PetroChina Co. (857)  and  Cnooc Ltd. (883)  that are
tapping the world’s largest reserves of the unconventional fuel.  China holds 25.08 trillion cubic meters of exploitable
onshore shale-gas reserves, the land ministry  said  on March 1,
citing a nationwide survey. That’s part of an estimated 134.42
trillion cubic meters of total gas reserves in the country,
according to the ministry.  Proven exploitable shale-gas reserves may reach 200 billion
cubic meters by 2015, the NDRC, the country’s top economic
planning agency, said March 16.  The U.S. has 482 trillion cubic feet (13.65 trillion cubic
meters) of technically recoverable gas from shale formations,
the Energy Information Administration said in a Jan. 23
estimate. U.S. shale-gas output rose to 15 billion cubic feet in
2010 from 1 billion in 2000, according to industry consultant
IHS Energy.  For Related News and Information:
