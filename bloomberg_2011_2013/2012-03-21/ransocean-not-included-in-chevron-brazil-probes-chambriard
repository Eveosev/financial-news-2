Transocean Ltd. (RIG) , the rig operator
at  Chevron Corp.’s (CVX)  $3.6 billion Frade project in Brazil, was
spared by the country’s oil regulator in an investigation of a
3,000-barrel oil spill in November.  There were “no problems with Transocean’s platform,”
Magda Chambriard, the head of the oil regulator known as ANP,
told reporters today in  Rio de Janeiro , referring to
Transocean’s drilling equipment. “Transocean doesn’t have a
direct role with us, it is with the operator” Chevron, she
said.  The regulator is carrying out 25 separate probes into the
leak and is waiting for Chevron to respond to its findings,
Chambriard said. The oil slick at Chevron’s field off Rio’s
coast occurred at a time  Brazil  is increasing scrutiny of deep-
water drilling following the 2010 Macondo spill in the U.S. Gulf
of Mexico.  Transocean is included in a separate lawsuit filed today by
federal prosecutor Eduardo Santos. Seventeen Chevron and
Transocean executives were banned by a federal court from
leaving Brazil pending the investigation by the prosecutors.  Transocean fell 0.7 percent to $56.97 at 1:55 p.m. in New
York. It pared losses of as much as 1.7 percent after
Chambriard’s comments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
