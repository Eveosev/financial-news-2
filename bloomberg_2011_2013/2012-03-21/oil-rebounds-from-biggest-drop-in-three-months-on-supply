Oil traded near its lowest closing
price in three days before a weekly report on supply and demand
levels in the U.S., erasing earlier gains as the dollar
strengthened.  West Texas Intermediate was little changed, having given up
an increase of as much as 0.7 percent. A stronger dollar
typically undermines investorsâ€™ appetite to protect against
inflation through purchasing commodities. The Energy Department
may say today that stockpiles climbed 2.2 million barrels, a
Bloomberg News survey showed.  Saudi Arabia  can increase output
by 25 percent immediately, Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said
yesterday.  Crude for May delivery was at $106.20 a barrel on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:54 p.m. London time. The contract
dropped $2.49 yesterday to $106.07, the lowest close since March
15. The euro erased gains against the dollar to trade at $1.3222
in New York. The 17-nation currency reached an almost two-week
high earlier. The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which tracks the U.S. currency
against those of six trading partners, climbed as much as 0.2
percent after declining 0.4 percent earlier today.  -- Editor:  John Buckley   To contact the reporters on this story:
