The  International Monetary Fund  is
ready to start talks with Hungary on a standby  credit line  in
May if the government meets conditions imposed by the European
Commission,  Hvg.hu  reported.  IMF officials will hold negotiations in Budapest in April
as part of a separate review of Hungary’s earlier bailout in
2008, the news website said.  The Washington-based lender has also made “conditional”
plans to begin talks on a fresh aid package in May, Hvg.hu said,
without citing anyone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
