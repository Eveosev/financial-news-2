Former University of Nevada- Las
Vegas  basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian is in good condition
after suffering a mild heart attack yesterday, according to a
hospital spokeswoman.  The 81-year-old Tarkanian, who coached at the collegiate
level for 38 seasons and led the  Runnin’ Rebels  to a national
championship in 1990, was taken to MountainView Hospital in Las
Vegas yesterday. His daughter, Jodie Diamant, told the Las Vegas
Review-Journal that Tarkanian started wheezing during a doctor’s
visit and tests found he had a heart attack.  Tarkanian will stay another night at MountainView as a
precaution, hospital spokeswoman Amanda Powell said.  “He is stable and he is in good condition,” Powell said
in a telephone interview.  Tarkanian retired as a coach in 2002 after compiling a 778-
202 record at UNLV, Fresno State and Long Beach State. He never
had a losing season.  Tarkanian led UNLV to the Final Four of the National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament in 1990 and 1991. He
was forced to resign in 1992 after published photos showed three
former players in a hot tub with a man who was convicted of
fixing basketball games. He went to Fresno State, his alma mater,
in 1996 and led the Bulldogs to six straight 20-win seasons
before retiring following a 19-15 campaign in 2001-02.  To contact the reporter on this story:
