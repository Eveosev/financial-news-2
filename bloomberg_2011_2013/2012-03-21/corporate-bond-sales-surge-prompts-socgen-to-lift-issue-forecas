Europe ’s busiest day for corporate
bond sales in two years prompted  Societe Generale SA (GLE)  credit
analysts to increase their 2012 issuance forecast by about 40
percent to “closer to” 100 billion euros ($132 billion).  Bond offerings reached 47.5 billion euros this year,
according to Paris-based SocGen, after Fiat SpA, Daimler AG and
Electricite de France SA led 6.6 billion euros of sales
yesterday in the biggest day of issuance since Jan. 12, 2010.
SocGen will publish the revision to its current forecast of 70
billion euros next week, according to  Suki Mann  in London.  Greece’s debt restructuring and the  European Central Bank ’s
injection of cash into banks through loans have combined to
boost optimism that Europe’s sovereign crisis will be contained.
This has driven yields on investment-grade corporate debt down
to 2.73 percent, just above last week’s record low 2.6 percent,
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show.  “Rates are still near all-time lows and companies are
thinking it doesn’t get cheaper than this and prudently looking
to refinance what would likely have been more expensive if
they’d waited,” said Tim Barker, head of credit research at
Societe Generale in  London . “The market’s open, investors have
got cash and companies need to ensure their future, which adds
up to a heady flood of issuance.”  The flood of issuance continued today with BAA Funding
Ltd., owner of London’s Heathrow airport, Neste Oil Oyj and RCI
Banque SA, Renault SA’s financing unit, selling bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
