Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA (CSNA3) ,
 Brazil ’s third-largest steelmaker, dropped the most on the
Bovespa index after Barclays Plc cut its recommendation on the
stock, citing sluggish growth at the company’s mining unit.  CSN, as the Sao Paulo-based company is known,  fell  2.9
percent to 18.69 reais at 11:43 a.m. in  Sao Paulo , poised for
its biggest drop on a closing basis since March 6. The Bovespa
slipped 0.6 percent.  Barclays analysts led by Leonardo Correa in Sao Paulo
reduced CSN to the equivalent of sell from neutral, saying its
outperformance relative to Vale SA is unjustified. CSN, which
generated most of its profit from mining recently, has been
missing its guidance for the unit, the analysts said.  “We remain skeptical that CSN will deliver any meaningful
growth in the medium term,” they wrote. “We would need to see
a significant pick up in capex and the delivery of port capacity
expansions to increase confidence in execution.”  Shares of CSN  are up  25 percent this year, beating the
Bovespa’s 18 percent gain. Vale, the world’s largest iron-ore
producer, has advanced 9 percent in that time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
