Japanese  stock   futures  fell as the
yen strengthened against the dollar and U.S. home sales
unexpectedly dropped, damping the earnings outlook for Asian
exporters to the world’s biggest economy. Australian equities
were little changed.  American depositary receipts of  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , a
Japanese carmaker that earns more than a third of its revenue
from  North America , fell 0.7 percent from the closing share
price in Tokyo. Those of Sony Corp.,  Japan ’s biggest consumer-
electronics exporter, slid 0.2 percent after a report it plans
to sell its chemical operations. BHP Billiton Ltd., world’s
biggest mining company, fell 0.5 percent after metal prices
declined.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
June closed at 10,000 in Chicago yesterday, compared with 10,020
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 10,000 in
Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index was
little changed today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index was little
changed after a report showed economic growth slowed more than
economists predicted in the fourth quarter.  “The housing market isn’t clearly improving,” said
 Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $600 million in Tokyo at
Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. “Given that the U.S. growth
rate is beneath potential growth rates, the housing market won’t
get better if left to itself.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  were little
changed today. The gauge slid 0.2 percent in New York yesterday
on concern the best first quarter since 1998 has outpaced
economic prospects and as  Baker Hughes (BHI)  Inc. drove a selloff in
energy shares. Baker Hughes, the world’s third-largest oilfield-
services provider, said that a shift away from gas rigs will
hurt earnings.  Home Sales  A report yesterday showed purchases of previously owned
U.S. homes dropped 0.9 percent to a 4.59 million  annual rate 
from a revised 4.63 million pace in January. The median forecast
in a Bloomberg News survey called for an increase to 4.61
million.  The yen appreciated to as high as 83.30 against the dollar
today in  Tokyo , compared with 83.72 at the close of stock
trading yesterday. Against the euro, Japan’s currency
strengthened to 110.05 from 111.09. A stronger yen cuts the
value of overseas income at Japanese companies when repatriated.  Oil rose after the U.S. Energy Department said  crude
inventories  unexpectedly dropped 1.16 million barrels last week.
Crude oil for May delivery increased $1.20 to settle at $107.27
a barrel in New York yesterday.  Metal Prices  The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial metals including copper and aluminum fell 0.3
percent.  The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded Chinese
equities in the U.S rose 1.2 percent to 104.66 in  New York 
yesterday. Chinese stocks listed in the U.S. climbed for the
first time in four days, led by Internet companies, as  China 
moves to bolster credit growth and ward off an economic
slowdown.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (TPX)  gained 10.8 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with an 11.6 percent advance by the
 S&P 500  and a 9.9 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600
Index. Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 14.9 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 13.5 times for the
S&P 500 and 11.2 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
