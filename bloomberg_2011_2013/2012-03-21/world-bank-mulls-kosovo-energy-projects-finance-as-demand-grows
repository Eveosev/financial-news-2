The  World Bank  and its financing
arm, the International Finance Corp., is considering financing
energy projects in Kosovo on increased demand for electricity.  The Washington-based lender, with the Multi Investment
Guarantee Agency, is willing to finance the construction of a
new 600-megawatt power plant, development of the associate
Sibovc lignite mine and the rehabilitation of the Kosovo B
thermal power plant, Phillipe Le Houerou, the World Bank’s vice
president for  Europe  and Central Asia, wrote in a letter to
Prime Minister Hashim Thaci today.  “The gap in energy supply will need to be met by stepped-
up efforts to generate energy from all practical renewable
sources and significantly  energy efficiency  in addition to
thermal power generation,” the World Bank said in the letter.  Kosovo , which became an independent country in 2008 when it
separated from its former ruler Serbia, is seeing an increase in
energy use as the economy expands much faster than  some of its
neighbors and consumers use more electricity.  Gross domestic product in the predominantly ethnic Albanian
nation is forecast to expand at an annual rate of 3.8 percent,
according to the  International Monetary Fund .  By contrast, Serbia’s GDP is set to grow 0.5 percent this
year, the IMF has said.  World Bank’s Le Houerou will hold talks with Kosovo
officials on the energy projects financing next month in the
capital Pristina, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
