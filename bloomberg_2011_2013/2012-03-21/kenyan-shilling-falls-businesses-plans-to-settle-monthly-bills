Kenya ’s shilling weakened for the
second day on increased demand for dollars as businesses sought
to settle monthly obligations.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated
as much as 0.5 percent and traded 0.2 percent lower at 82.90 per
dollar by 5:22 p.m. in Nairobi.  “The shilling is under pressure as businesses seek more
dollars in preparation for settling their end-month,”  Jeremiah Kendagor, acting head of trading at Nairobi-based  Kenya
Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , said in a phone interview.  The central bank left its key lending rate at a record high
of 18 percent for a third month after increasing it six times
last year to keep the inflation rate under check and support the
shilling. The Kenyan currency has gained 28 percent since Oct.
11 when it hit a record low of 106.75 per dollar, making it the
best-performing among more than 170 currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  Kenya’s  inflation rate  declined for a third month to 16.69
percent in February from 18.3 percent in January, the Nairobi-
based Kenya National Bureau of Statistics said in an e-mailed
statement Feb. 29.  The Ugandan shilling weakened to the lowest in two weeks,
depreciating 0.7 percent to 2,492 per dollar.  “The weakness has been driven by interbank dollar
purchases,” Benon Okwenje, a currency trader at  Stanbic Bank
Uganda Ltd. (SBU) , said by phone from Kampala. “Dollar inflows have
been affected by the end of the main coffee season,” he said.  The harvest in the main producing central and eastern
regions is at its tail-end, according to the Uganda Coffee
Development Authority.  Falling yields on government debt are also to blame for
reduced dollar inflows, Okwenje said. Yields on the three-month
Treasury bills retreated to 19.504 percent on Feb 22 from 19.890
percent on Feb. 8 and 23.42 percent on Jan 25.  Tanzania’s shilling fell for the first time in three days,
depreciating 0.2 percent to 1,593.75 per dollar.  -- With assistance from David Malingha Doya in  Dar es Salaam  and
