Ukrainian egg producer  Avangardco
Investments Public Ltd. (AVGR)  said profit rose 6.2 percent last year
on higher prices and increased output and sales volumes.  Net income rose to $196.3 million from $184.8 million in
2010, the Kiev-based company said in an e-mailed statement
today.  “This success is a testament to both our progress as a
company and also to Ukraine’s agricultural potential,” Chief
Executive Officer Nataliya Vasylyuk said in the statement.  Ukraine’s record 2011 grain harvest has helped the company
to buy poultry feed at good prices, according to the statement.
The harvest rose 44 percent from the previous year to 56.7
million tons, the state statistics office has said.  Avangardco said its production rose 34.7 percent last year,
to 5.96 billion eggs. Of those, 4.86 billion were sold in their
original state, a 25 percent increase in volume, and the rest
were made into powder. Revenue rose 25.8 percent to $553.3
million, according to the statement.  The company foresees continuing sales growth, helped by
higher demand in Ukraine and in export markets.  The average domestic selling price for eggs increased 12.3
percent in 2011, according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
