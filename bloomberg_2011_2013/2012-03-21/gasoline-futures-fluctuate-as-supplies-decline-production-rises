Gasoline retreated after the Energy
Department reported weaker fuel demand for last week.  Futures slipped as  demand  fell 0.4 percent to 8.38 million
barrels a day even as gasoline stockpiles contracted a fifth
straight week. Fuel use over the past four weeks was 7.8 percent
below a year earlier.  “I like the gasoline draw, but retail prices continue to
inch up,” said  David Pursell , a managing director at Tudor
Pickering Holt & Co. LLC in Houston. “It’s not good. With
demand numbers weak and prices higher, you wonder what’s going
to make those demand numbers go higher.”  Gasoline for April delivery fell 0.6 cent to settle at
$3.3571 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures
have surged 25 percent this year, the best performance in the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 commodities.  Gasoline stockpiles  dropped 1.21 million barrels to a 10-
week low of 226.9 million as output slipped 0.7 percent.
Gasoline supplies are 3.3 percent higher than year-earlier
levels. A decline of 2 million barrels was projected in a survey
by Bloomberg News.  “This is neutral to bullish, and will probably keep a
floor under prices,” said  Sander Cohan , a global transportation
fuels analyst and principal with Energy Security Analysis Inc.
in Wakefield,  Massachusetts . “But product demand for both
gasoline and diesel are awful.”  Total fuel use  over the past four weeks was 5.7 percent
below a year earlier, according to department data. By that same
measure,  distillate demand  was 8.5 percent below last year.  Retail Demand  Retail gasoline demand this year through March 16 fell 5.6
percent lower than a year earlier, according to MasterCard
Inc.’s SpendingPulse report yesterday. That’s the biggest
decline for this time of the year in MasterCard records, dating
back to July 2004. Measured on a four-week average, consumption
has fallen below year-earlier levels for 51 consecutive weeks.  Prices also fell as mortgage applications in the U.S.
slipped for a sixth straight week. The  Mortgage Bankers (MBAVBASC) 
Association’s index declined 7.4 percent in the period ended
March 16 from the prior week, the Washington-based trade group
reported today.  “Weak economic news, that’s what going to put the brakes
on gasoline today,” said  James Cordier , portfolio manager at
OptionSellers.com in Tampa,  Florida . “Gasoline and heating oil
have been outperforming crude oil. The crude draw is positive
for crude and the cracks are giving some back.”  Crack Spread  The May gasoline crack spread on the Nymex fell $1.46 to
$33.23 a barrel.  Crude oil inventories  declined unexpectedly,
dropping 1.16 million barrels to 346.3 million. The survey
projected a decline of 2.2 million barrels. Stockpiles at
 Cushing (DOESCROK) , the delivery point for New York futures, fell 0.5
percent.  Supplies (DOESDIST)  of distillates, including heating oil and diesel,
rose for the first time in six weeks, gaining 1.76 million
barrels to 136.6 million. The survey projected a drop of 1.5
million barrels. The increase came as distillate exports fell
from a record 1.12 million barrels a day to 956,000, according
to preliminary estimates.  “There’s no late-season cold, so distillate demand is weak
and you are exporting less,” Pursell said.  Heating oil for April delivery fell 2.05 cents, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $3.2162 a gallon. Prices have gained 9.6
percent this year.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 1.8
cents to $3.864 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA, the
nation’s biggest motoring group. Prices have gained 18 percent
this year and are 8.9 percent higher than a year ago. Gasoline
peaked in 2011 at $3.985 on May 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
