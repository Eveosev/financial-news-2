The West Indies and  Australia  tied
the third match of their one-day cricket series after captain
Darren Sammy was run out with his team needing one run from the
last three balls to win in  St. Vincent .  Sammy hit a boundary off the previous delivery to lift
West Indies, which had recovered from 78-5, to 220-9 as it
chased the victory target of 221 in Kingstown. He was then run
out by Brett Lee following a mix-up with Kemar Roach.  “We should have won and we have quite a few disappointed
boys in the dressing room,” West Indies coach Ottis Gibson said
at a news conference. “But, look at it this way, we didn’t lose
the match and we are still in with a great chance of winning the
series.”  The result, the 27th tie in 3,266 one-day international
matches, leaves the best-of-five contest level at 1-1 before the
final two games in St. Lucia on March 23 and 25.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
