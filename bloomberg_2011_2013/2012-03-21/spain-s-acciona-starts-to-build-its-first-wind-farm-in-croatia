Acciona SA (ANA) , Spain’s second-biggest
wind farm operator, started to build a 30-megawatt plant in
 Croatia  that will produce enough power for at least 30,000
homes, the company said today in a statement.  The 30-megawatt Jelinak wind project in the Split-Dalmatia
area is the first installation of this type that Acciona has
installed in Croatia, it said. It will use 20 Acciona turbines
each with a 1.5-megawatt capacity. The company expects to
complete the park by year-end, the e-mailed statement said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
