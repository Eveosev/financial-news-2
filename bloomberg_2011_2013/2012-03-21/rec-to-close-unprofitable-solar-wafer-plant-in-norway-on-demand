Renewable Energy Corp. ASA (REC) , the
Norwegian solar-parts maker that halted factories last year,
said it will permanently close its Glomfjord wafer plant in
Norway after failing to cut costs enough to make it profitable.  REC, based in Sandvika near Oslo, will close the 300
megawatt monocrystalline wafer plant with the loss of 200 jobs,
it said in a statement today.  While the plant has made cost reductions, these have “not
been sufficient to ensure profitability in a very challenging
market,” Chief Executive Officer Ole Enger said.  European solar-component makers are under pressure from
Chinese rivals that expanded output capacity just as consumption
slowed, causing wafer and cell prices to plummet.  REC and its European peers  Solarworld AG (SWV)  and  Q-Cells SE (QCE) 
have cut production as demand shrinks in the region, where
Germany, France and Italy have reduced subsidies to cap booming
solar installations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
