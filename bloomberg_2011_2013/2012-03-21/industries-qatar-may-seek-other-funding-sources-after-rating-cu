Industries Qatar (IQCD) , the Persian Gulf
country’s second-biggest company by market value, will “explore
alternative sources of finance” to fund growth, Abdulrahman
Ahmad Al-Shaibi, the company’s chief coordinator, said in its
2011 annual report.  Industries Qatar received a AA minus credit rating from
 Standard & Poor’s  last month and a Aa3 rating from Moody’s
Investors Service last year. Both ratings were one level below
the sovereign-credit grade for the country, Al-Shaibi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
