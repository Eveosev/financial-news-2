HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , the world’s
second-largest bank by market value, is exiting the consumer-
finance business in  Canada  it bought almost a decade ago,
following similar moves in the U.S. and U.K.  The operation “no longer supports HSBC’s core business and
growth strategy in Canada,” the lender said today in a
statement. About 500 employees at 75 offices across country will
be “impacted” by the move, the bank said.  HSBC purchased the business from  Household International  in
2003. The London-based company will now focus in Canada on
commercial banking, global banking, consumer banking and asset
management. HSBC sold its Canadian investment-advisory business
in January to  National Bank of Canada  for C$206 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
