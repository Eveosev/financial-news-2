OpenView Venture Partners , a
Boston-based investing firm, raised $200 million for its third
fund as it seeks out early-stage business-software companies.  The fund was “significantly oversubscribed” and exceeded
the $150 million the firm expected to bring in, OpenView said
today in a statement. OpenView has about $445 million in capital
under management.  Rather than competing with Silicon Valley’s top firms for
the hottest social-media and consumer Internet deals, OpenView
looks for startups in other regions that sell software to
businesses. Of its 18 current portfolio companies, only  Mashery
Inc.  is in the  San Francisco  Bay Area. Investments elsewhere
include Balihoo Inc., a marketing automation company in Boise,
Idaho, and Acronis Inc., an online-backup service near  Boston .  OpenView was founded in 2006 by Scott Maxwell, who was
previously a managing director at Insight Venture Partners. As
Insight started focusing on more mature companies, Maxwell
created OpenView to fund younger startups.  None of the firm’s companies have gone public yet, and the
only one to be acquired was Loyalty Lab Inc., which  Tibco
Software Inc. (TIBX)  bought in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
