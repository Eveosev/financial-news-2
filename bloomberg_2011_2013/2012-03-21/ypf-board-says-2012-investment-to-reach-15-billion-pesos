YPF SA (YPFD)  will invest a record 15
billion pesos ($3.44 billion) in 2012, up from 13.3 billion a
year earlier, the company’s board decided today, a company
official, who can’t be named because the announcement isn’t
public, said in a telephone interview.  The government representative voted against the board’s
proposal to use 91 percent of the company’s profit to capitalize
the company, the official said. The capitalization was approved
by the rest of the board and will be submitted for approval to a
general shareholders meeting on April 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
