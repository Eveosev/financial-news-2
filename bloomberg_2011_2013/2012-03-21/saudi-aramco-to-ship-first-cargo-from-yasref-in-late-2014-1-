Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the world’s
largest crude exporter, said the Yasref refinery will ship its
first oil-product cargo in the fourth quarter of 2014.  The plant on the  Red Sea  will start operating in September
of that year following completion in June, the company said
today in a statement on its website.  China Petroleum & Chemical
Corp. (600028)  or Sinopec, has a stake in the plant.  Saudi Aramco , as the company is known, is expanding
refining capacity as it seeks to export more finished products
that can fetch higher prices than crude. Yasref is one of three
new plants Saudi Aramco is building at home while a fourth plant
may be expanded.  The 400,000 barrel-a-day Yasref plant will cost $8.5
billion to $10 billion, Khalid al-Falih, head of  Saudi Arabia ’s
state-owned oil producer said in January. The refinery, which
will process Arab Heavy crude, will produce 263,000 barrels of
diesel a day and 90,000 barrels of gasoline, according to the
statement. It will also produce petroleum coke and benzene.  To contact the reporter on this story:
