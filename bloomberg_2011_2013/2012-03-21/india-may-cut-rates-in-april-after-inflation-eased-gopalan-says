India  may start cutting  interest
rates  from April to bolster economic growth following a
moderation in inflation, Economic Affairs Secretary R. Gopalan
said. Bonds rose.  “If inflation remains at this level after factoring in
various things, then interest-rate reversal may start in
April,” Gopalan, one of the finance ministry’s top bureaucrats,
said in a Bloomberg UTV interview yesterday. “It is important
for this country since we are looking for higher growth.”  Gopalan’s comments come four days after Finance Minister
Pranab Mukherjee said he expects the  Reserve Bank  of India to
lower borrowing costs in coming months. The monetary authority
on March 15 again signaled readiness to cut after leaving rates
unchanged for a third meeting, while flagging inflation risks
from  oil prices , a weaker rupee and India’s fiscal deficit.  Net borrowing in the year to March 2013 may be 200 billion
rupees less than the 4.79 trillion-rupee ($94.6 billion)
estimate set out in last week’s annual budget, Gopalan said.
Careful expenditure and the government’s plan to increase
petroleum-product prices to curb oil subsidies may lead to the
savings, he said.  Benchmark bonds rose, with the yield on the 8.79 percent
note due November 2021 declining two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 8.39 percent yesterday. The  BSE India
Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  climbed 1.7 percent. The rupee weakened 0.5
percent to 50.6575 per dollar at the close. The currency has
rebounded 4.8 percent this year after sliding 16 percent in
2011.  Record Borrowing  In India’s annual budget last week, Mukherjee proposed to
cap a subsidy program that spans diesel to fertilizers at less
than 2 percent of GDP from next fiscal year. He also raised
service and excise taxes to 12 percent from 10 percent, seeking
to rein in the widest fiscal gap in major emerging economies.  He set out record gross borrowing of 5.69 trillion rupees
to finance a fiscal  gap  forecast at 5.1 percent of gross
domestic product in 2012-2013. He projected the deficit for
2011-2012 at 5.9 percent of GDP, wider than the 4.6 percent
target set a year ago.  Gopalan predicted an inflation rate of 6.5 percent to 6.7
percent for the year starting April 1, 2012. He also said more
steps may be taken to strengthen the rupee. The currency’s slump
last year was the worst in  Asia .  The RBI raised the  repurchase rate  by a record 3.75
percentage points from March 2010 to October last year, to 8.5
percent, to fight price increases. Inflation was 6.95 percent in
February, close to a 26-month low, after exceeding 9 percent for
most of 2011.  Indian inflation remains the fastest in the so-called BRIC
group that also includes  Brazil , Russia and  China . The nation
also has the widest BRIC fiscal shortfall.  The central bank has indicated that steps to pare the
budget gap would boost its scope to join emerging nations from
Brazil to the Philippines in lowering borrowing costs to shield
growth from risks such as  Europe ’s protracted debt crisis.  Expansion in Asia’s third-largest economy moderated to 6.1
percent last quarter from a year earlier, the slowest pace in
almost three years, as costlier credit hurt  consumer spending 
and dented investment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
