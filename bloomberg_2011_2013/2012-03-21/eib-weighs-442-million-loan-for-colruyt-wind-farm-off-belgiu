The  European Investment Bank  may
loan as much as 335 million euros ($442 million) to a Belgian
offshore wind farm owned by the retailer  Colruyt SA (COLR)  and a unit
of the renewable energy developer Aspiravi Holding NV.  The Northwind project, formerly known as the Eldepasco wind
park, will be 216 megawatts in capacity when built, the European
Investment Bank said in a website  statement .  The European Union’s lending arm is considering the loan to
the venture between Belgium’s Colruyt and the offshore wind
division of Aspiravi as the 27-nation bloc moves toward meeting
a goal of getting 20 percent of energy from renewable sources by
2020 to help fight  climate change .  Northwind NV plans to construct the North Sea farm at Bank
zonder Naam, according to the group’s website.  Vestas Wind
Systems A/S (VWS)  agreed on a conditional contract to supply turbines
at the facility in January.  The EIB’s plan for the loan doesn’t commit the bank to
finance the project, according to the EIB. It will require
approval from the board of directors and signing of a contract
before the loan is made.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
