Korea National Oil Corp. (KNOCPZ) ,  South
Korea ’s state energy developer, said it will join an Apollo
Global Management LLC-led group that agreed to buy El Paso
Corp.’s oil and gas exploration business for $7.15 billion.  The group, which includes Riverstone Holdings LLC and
Access Industries Inc., will probably make the acquisition in
the first half, the Anyang, South Korea-based company, known as
KNOC, said today in an e-mailed statement, without giving a
value or details of its proposed holding.  “The deal is in line with our efforts to boost output from
invested overseas oil assets,” Lee Za Kang, a spokesman at
KNOC, said by telephone.  The El Paso purchase is the second asset-deal KNOC has
signed with Apollo in four months. KNOC agreed in December to
buy Parallel Petroleum Corp., an oil and gas producer based in
Midland,  Texas , from Apollo for $771.5 million.  The state energy developer produced 220,000 barrels a day
from its invested overseas oilfields last year and aims to boost
the daily output to 300,000 barrels this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
