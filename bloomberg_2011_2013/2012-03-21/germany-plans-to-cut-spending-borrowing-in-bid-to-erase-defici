Germany  plans to cut spending and
borrowing next year as forecasts show growth in  Europe ’s biggest
economy will exceed current estimates.  Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble today unveiled a 2013
draft budget, saying his spending plans will balance measures to
foster growth with the government pledge to cut its deficit.  “The capacity to cut the deficit steadily presumes
economic growth,” Schaeuble said. The blueprint “embodies
policies that will foster economic growth and our commitments to
cut debt.” German  government spending  will rise in 2014 by 1
percent and by 1.5 percent in 2015, the draft shows.  The government in Berlin plans to cut its net borrowing
next year to 19.6 billion euros ($26 billion) from a planned
24.9 billion euros and from 34.8 billion euros expected this
year, Schaeuble said at a press conference in Berlin. Overall
spending will drop to 300.7 billion euros or 3.8 percent less
than last year, said the  Christian Democrat .  The German economy may grow faster this year than the 0.7
percent expansion on which Schaeuble bases his deficit forecast,
the RWI-Essen economic institute said today, citing the outlook
for exports and domestic demand. The economy may grow 1 percent
this year, said RWI.  Germany will achieve the goal of balancing its budget in
2014, two years earlier than stipulated in a constitutional
“debt brake,” Schaeuble said. At the height of the bank crisis
in 2009, Germany adopted the law committing the three levels of
government to report a composite balanced budget by 2016. The
euro’s rules determine that a budget is in balance if the
deficit is below 0.5 percent of gross domestic product.  The structural deficit -- a measure of regular overspending
on portfolios such as pensions that’s stripped of one-off or
short-term factors -- will decline from 1 percent of GDP this
year to 0.54 percent in 2013 and 0.26 percent in 2014, said
Schaeuble.  The federal borrowing target will more than double from
last year primarily as a result of two cash payments to the euro
region’s permanent rescue fund, Schaeuble said. The 2013 draft
budget will not be passed in parliament before December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
