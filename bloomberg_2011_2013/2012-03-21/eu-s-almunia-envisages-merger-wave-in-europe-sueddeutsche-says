Mergers and acquisitions will
probably increase in  Europe  this year as companies seek
opportunities to spend piled-up cash,  Joaquin Almunia , the
European Union’s competition commissioner, was quoted as saying
in an interview with  Germany ’s  Sueddeutsche Zeitung .  Historically low share prices have made many companies
potential takeover targets, the Munich-based newspaper cited
Almunia as saying. He didn’t name any companies, according to
the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
