NicOx SA (COX)  shares surged to the
highest in almost two years after the French drug developer
agreed to buy a stake in U.K. eye-medicine company Altacor Ltd.
as part of a plan to build an ophthalmology business.  NicOx jumped as much as 44 percent to 4.50 euros, the
highest intraday price since May 12, 2010, and was trading up 33
percent at 4.15 euros as of 2:40 p.m. in Paris.  The company will pay 2 million pounds ($3.17 million) for
the stake, Sophia Antipolis-based NicOx said today in a
 statement . The drugmaker announced the agreement eight days
after publishing positive trial results on a glaucoma treatment
licensed to  Bausch & Lomb Inc. (BOL)  NicOx had fallen in each of the
previous past five years after setbacks in  drug development .  “In just a few days, NicOx has completely changed its
profile,” Sebastien Malafosse, an analyst at Bryan, Garnier &
Co. in Paris, wrote in a note to clients today. “This
acquisition is the first step” in a strategy to become “a
revenue generating company with global exposure,” said
Malafosse, who has a “buy” recommendation on the stock.  The French company has an option to acquire the rest of
Altacor for 9 million pounds, to be paid in shares, cash or a
combination of the two, NicOx said. The price for Cambridge,
England-based Altacor may increase by as much as 8.5 million
pounds if the U.K. company meets certain goals, it said.  NicOx will focus on “building an international business in
ophthalmology” going forward, Chief Executive Officer Michele Garufi, 58, told analysts on a conference call today. The
Altacor agreement is “the first step of in our
transformation,” giving NicOx access to “a commercial platform
in a major European market, experienced management team and a
pipeline of near-term products.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
