Canadian natural gas was little
changed amid warmer-than-normal U.S. temperatures that have
pared demand for furnace fuels.  Alberta  gas fell 0.25 cent. Chicago may have a high
tomorrow of 74 degrees Fahrenheit (25 Celsius), 25 above
average, according to State College, Pennsylvania-based
AccuWeather Inc. Temperature-related demand for gas trailed
normal by as much as 30 percent over the winter, said energy
analyst  Stephen Smith .  “The week we’re in is about 50 percent below normal,”
said Smith, president of Stephen Smith Energy Associates in
Natchez, Mississippi.  Alberta gas for April delivery traded for $1.83 a gigajoule
($1.74 per million British thermal units) as of 12:10 p.m. New
York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market. NGX gas is down 36
percent this year.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for April delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 0.1 cent to $2.334 per million Btu at 12:17 p.m.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.7 billion cubic
feet, 76 million below target.  Pipeline Flows  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 1.88 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.25 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 896 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.76 billion cubic feet today, or 66 percent of its
capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.05
billion cubic feet at 11:05 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
