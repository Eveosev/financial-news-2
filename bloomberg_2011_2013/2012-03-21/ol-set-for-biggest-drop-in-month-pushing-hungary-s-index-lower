Mol Nyrt. (MOL) , Hungary’s largest
refiner, dropped the most in more than a month as the country’s
stocks fell on concern the government will face delays in
international bailout talks.  The shares fell 2.3 percent to 19,200 forint by the close
in Budapest, the biggest decline since Feb. 10. The benchmark
BUX stock  index , in which Mol has a 33 percent weighting,
dropped 0.9 percent to 19,053.07.  Hungary may refuse to accept conditions for aid from the
International Monetary Fund and the European Union until as late
as the fourth quarter of 2012, which would be a year after
requesting the assistance,  Gyula Toth , a Vienna-based analyst at
 UniCredit SpA (UCG) , wrote in a research report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
