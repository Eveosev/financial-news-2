Airports used by  Ryanair Holdings
Plc (RYA)  in Belgium and France face expanded probes by European Union
regulators over government aid that may have benefited some
budget carriers over rival airlines.  The European Commission extended an ongoing investigation
into state support for Belgium’s Charleroi airport to examine
changes to Ryanair’s contracts on airport access and aid from
the local Walloon regional government to the airport, it said in
a statement today.  The Brussels-based regulator is also probing France’s
Angouleme airport over a 2008 agreement with Ryanair and public
support to finance its operations. It also started a second
investigation into  Germany ’s Dortmund airport over state
guarantees and airport charges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
