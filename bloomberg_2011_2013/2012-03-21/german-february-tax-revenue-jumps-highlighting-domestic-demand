German federal and state  tax
revenue  jumped 6.9 percent in February compared with a year
earlier as unemployment continued to fall and companies reported
export growth in Asia, the  Finance Ministry  said.  Falling unemployment boosted income tax revenue in February
and sales tax led by the manufacturing sector, the Berlin-based
ministry said today in its report for March that looks back at
the previous month’s developments.  Federal tax revenue grew in the month by 5.5 percent from a
year earlier. State revenue grew 7.7 percent, the ministry said.  Recent indicators including the Ifo business confidence
index point to Germany’s economy growing quicker in the second
half of the year, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
