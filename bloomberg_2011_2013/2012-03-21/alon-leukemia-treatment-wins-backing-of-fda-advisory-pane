Talon Therapeutics Inc. (TLON) , a
biotechnology company with no mareted products, won the 
backing of a U.S. advisory panel for accelerated approval 
of its blood-cancer treatment.  The advisers voted 7-4 that the benefits of the 
anti-leukemia therapy called Marqibo outweigh its risks. 
The  Food and Drug Administration  is considering Marqibo, 
the  San Mateo , California-based company’s lead product 
candidate, based on the second of three phases of 
clinical trials typically required for approval.  Talon would have to complete the final trials and 
prove the drug’s benefit if the FDA clears the treatment. 
The agency is due to decide by May 13. The therapy would 
treat adults with a form of acute lymphoblasticleukemia, 
a fast-growing cancer of the white blood cells.  To contact the reporter on this story:
