percent, the most since Feb. 23, to 10.46 naira on investor bets
the company will pay a dividend for 2011, with results expected
by the end of this month.  “Investors are expecting that the bank’s full-year result
will be good and that it will pay a dividend,” Emeka Maubuike,
chief executive officer of Compass Investments and Securities
Limited, a Lagos-based brokerage, said by phone today.  Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL) , sub-Saharan Africa’s third-biggest
airline, dropped the most in a week on concern dilution from its
rights offer may outweigh the positive effects of the company’s
expansion plans.  The shares fell 1.7 percent to 14.25 shillings. The airline
will offer 1.48 billion shares, issuing 16 for every five held
at 14 shillings each from April 2 to April 18 to raise $250
million, the company said March 12.  “The concern among investors is how quickly the money
raised will start generating income for the business because of
the level of dilution of the value of existing shares,” Eric
Musau, a research analyst at Nairobi-based Standard Investment
Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
