LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD) , the biggest
professional-networking website, rose to the highest closing
price since August after  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  raised its
rating on the stock to buy.  LinkedIn gained 6.5  percent  to $97.78 at the close in New
York, the highest close since Aug. 3. The  Mountain View ,
California-based company has advanced 55 percent this year.  The company, which first sold shares to the public in May,
has about 150 million members. LinkedIn’s appeal to recruiters,
and its ability to boost customer engagement through new
products such as a mobile application, should allow its hiring-
solutions and marketing-services businesses to do better than
expected, Heath Terry, a Goldman Sachs analyst, wrote in a note
today.  “LinkedIn is one of the companies best positioned to
benefit from growth in mobile usage given its reliance on
subscriptions over advertising,” wrote Terry, who previously
rated the shares neutral. “This will be a key factor in driving
outperformance in the sector over the next few years.”  In the fourth quarter of 2011, LinkedIn’s hiring solutions
 revenue  more than doubled from a year earlier to $84.9 million,
while sales in the marketing-solutions business increased 77
percent to $49.5 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
