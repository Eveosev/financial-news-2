Caxton Associates LP hired  Jason
Quinn  from  Barclays Plc (BARC)  to invest in U.S. corporate credit as
the $9.7 billion hedge fund founded by  Bruce Kovner  builds its
debt team.  Quinn, 34, was most recently a managing director in credit
trading at Barclays Capital in  New York , where he traded the CDX
Investment Grade index and credit-default swaps tied to the debt
of auto companies. He previously co-headed U.S. high-grade
trading at the investment-banking division of London-based
Barclays.  Quinn will start at New York-based Caxton in a month, said
the people, who asked not to be named because the hiring wasn’t
announced. He will join Peter Agnes, who headed Barclays’s
credit opportunities group before leaving to join the hedge fund
in April 2011. Agnes was planning to hire additional investment
professionals for Caxton, including a Barclays associate,
according to people with knowledge of the move at the time.  Chris Mittendorf, a spokesman for Caxton, and Kristin
Friel, a spokeswoman for Barclays, declined comment.  Quinn, who graduated from  Cornell University  in 2000,
joined Barclays in 2008 from Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
where he headed the U.S. high-grade flow desk.  Investment-grade debt in the U.S. had its best two-month
start to a year since 2001, returning 3.1 percent in January and
February, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.
It has lost 1.4 percent this month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
