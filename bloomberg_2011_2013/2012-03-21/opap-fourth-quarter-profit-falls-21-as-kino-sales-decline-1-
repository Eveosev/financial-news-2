Opap SA (OPAP) ,  Europe â€™s biggest listed
gambling company, said fourth-quarter profit fell 21 percent,
hurt by lower sales of its biggest numbers game, Kino.  Net income dropped to 128.3 million euros ($169 million)
from 162.7 million euros a year earlier, according to an  Athens
bourse  filing today. Full-year profit declined 6.7 percent to
537.5 million euros.  Fourth-quarter revenue fell 7.9 percent to 1.16 billion
euros, according to the filing. Sales for fixed-odds sports
betting game Pame Stihima declined 15 percent to 421.9 million
euros and dropped 8.2 percent to 599.4 million euros for Kino.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization dropped 14 percent to 185 million euros, hurt by a
one-time cost to buy new licenses. Opap extended its monopoly on
sports betting in  Greece  to 2030, introduced new games, cut
costs and acquired a license for video lottery terminals, Chief
Executive Officer Ioannis Spanoudakis said in the filing.  The company will pay a dividend of 72 euro cents a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
