New Zealand Prime Minister John Key
accepted the resignation of Environment Minister Nick Smith from
his cabinet after a conflict of interest.  “It is important that ministers are seen to actively
manage both real and perceived conflicts of interest in the
exercise of their duties,” Key said in an e-mailed statement.
“Perceptions do matter and he knows he has let himself down.”  Smith tendered his resignation today, saying he made errors
of judgment in dealing with a conflict of interest while he was
minister for the  Accident Compensation Corp ., the state-owned
accident insurer. These included writing a letter to the
corporation on behalf of a friend on ministerial letterhead, and
signing off another letter on the same matter.  “The signing of those two letters is not up to the
standards this parliament should rightly expect of its
ministers,” Smith said in a statement he read to parliament.
The letters did not seek “in any way” to interfere in ACC
decision-making, he said.  Smith will remain in parliament representing the Nelson
constituency. He has been a member for the South Island region
since 1990.  Gerry Brownlee  will be acting Local Government Minister,
Key said today. Chris Finlayson will act as Environment Minister
and Craig Foss will act in  Climate Change .  To contact the reporter on this story:
