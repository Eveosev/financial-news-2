The Malaysian ringgit rose on signs
the U.S. recovery is taking hold, brightening the outlook for
exports from  Southeast Asia ’s third-biggest economy.  Sales of previously owned U.S. houses climbed 0.9 percent
last month, the most since May 2010, according to the median
forecast of economists in a Bloomberg News survey before a
report from the National Association of Realtors due today. The
U.S. was Malaysia’s fourth-largest export market in January,
according to official data. The Malaysian central bank is due to
release its 2012 economic growth forecast at 6 p.m. local time.  “Malaysia is still relatively strong and growth is
reasonably solid,” said  Thomas Harr , head of Asian currency
strategy at Standard Chartered Plc in Singapore. “If the U.S.
recovery takes hold, that should benefit exports and be good for
the ringgit.”  The ringgit gained 0.1 percent to 3.093 per dollar as of
4:13 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-
rate swings used to price options, held steady at 7.80 percent.  Malaysia’s economy grew 5.1 percent in 2011 after expanding
7.2 percent a year earlier. Gross domestic product will rise
from 5 percent to 6 percent in 2012, according to the
government’s annual economic report released in October.  Five-year  government bonds  declined. The yield on the 4.262
percent notes due September 2016 rose four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 3.33 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
