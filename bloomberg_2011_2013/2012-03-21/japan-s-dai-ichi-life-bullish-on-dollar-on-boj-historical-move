The  Bank of Japan (8301) ’s Feb. 14 meeting
marked a “historical turning point” that will drive the yen
weaker against the dollar, said Yasuhiro Miyata at Dai-Ichi Life
Insurance Co., which has about 4.1 trillion yen ($49 billion) in
foreign currency assets.  The central bank last month expanded its asset-purchase
program and set an inflation goal of 1 percent. The move
prompted a sell-off of the Japanese currency, which touched
84.18 per dollar on March 15, the weakest level since April 13.
The yen was at 83.64 as of 11:15 a.m. in  Tokyo  today.  The market’s attention is shifting to U.S. fundamentals, as
a spate of strong economic data provide “a significant
tailwind” to the greenback, said Tokyo-based Miyata, general
manager of foreign fixed income at Dai-Ichi,  Japan ’s second-
biggest life insurer. That’s sending the yen weaker and Japanese
stocks higher, further evidence of the “positive turnaround”
in markets, he said in a March 14 interview.  Still, currency-hedged foreign bonds are not good
investment options as yields on hedged  U.S. (.HUS10)  and  German (.HEUR)  bonds are
roughly the same as those on  20-year Japanese debt , Miyata said.
The insurer is currently cutting holdings of Treasuries and
bunds, while investing in “foreign corporate bonds by taking on
credit risk,” and the “sovereign debt of fast-growth
nations,” he said.  “The bonds and currencies of countries with solid growth
and yields are relatively strong,” Miyata said. The insurer
began to invest in assets in Mexico, Poland and  Malaysia  in
October, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
