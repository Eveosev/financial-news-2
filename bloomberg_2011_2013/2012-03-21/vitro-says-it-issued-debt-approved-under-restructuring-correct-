Vitro SAB, the Mexican glassmaker
in contested bankruptcy proceedings, said it issued debt as part
of the restructuring approved earlier this year by a judge in
Monterrey,  Mexico .  Vitro issued senior notes worth $815 million with an
interest rate of 8 percent and maturing in 2018 along with
obligatory convertible notes worth $110 million with an interest
rate of 12 percent. The convertible notes mature in 2015 and
would convert to a 20 percent equity stake if they arenâ€™t paid
down before maturity.  Vitro said it also paid a restructuring fee, without
disclosing the amount. The company sent an e-mailed statement
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
