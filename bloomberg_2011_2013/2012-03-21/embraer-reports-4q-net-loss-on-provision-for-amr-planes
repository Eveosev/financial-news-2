Embraer SA (EMBR3) , the world’s fourth-
largest airplane maker, rose the most in a month after reporting
sales that exceeded analysts’ estimates.  Embraer gained 3.7 percent to 14.16 reais at 3:56 p.m. in
Sao Paulo after rising as much as 5.2 percent earlier, the most
since Feb. 15. The  benchmark  Bovespa index lost 0.4 percent.  Sales rose 9.7 percent to 3.67 billion reais ($2 billion)
in the fourth quarter,  beating  the average estimate of 3.36
billion reais among three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The
 Sao Jose dos Campos , Brazil-based company posted a  loss  of 171.6
million reais in the quarter after booking a provision of 662.6
million reais for losses related to the possible return of 216
regional jets it sold to AMR Corp.  “The AMR writedown was unpleasant, but it’s wise for them
to do this because I believe they’ll get a lot of those aircraft
back,”  Ray Neidl , an analyst at Maxim Group LLC, wrote in an e-
mailed response to questions. “The outlook for commercial
aircraft is still bright, and they have the AMR negative now
taken care of.” Neidl rates Embraer a buy.  Embraer booked the provisions after AMR, the parent of
 American Airlines , sought bankruptcy in November. Of that total,
583.2 million reais are directly related to the likely return of
the regional jets and 79.4 million reais are additional
provisions related to other regional jets from Embraer’s ERJ-145
family, including planes operated by Mesa Air Group, which filed
for Chapter 11 in January 2010.  The possible return of AMR planes may lead to an oversupply
on the used-plane market, which led Embraer to increase
provisions for the regional jets operated by Mesa, according to
the earnings statement.  Embraer delivered 82 commercial and business jets in the
fourth quarter, down from 92 a year earlier. The company’s order
backlog was at $15.4 billion, according to the filing yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
