Germany  will “aggressively”
defend at the  European Court  of Justice a law that grants the
German state of  Lower Saxony ’s veto rights in major decisions at
 Volkswagen AG (VOW3) , Handelsblatt reported, citing the country’s
Economy Minister Philipp Roesler.  The so-called Volkswagen law was already revised in 2008 to
meet the court’s expectations, and Germany supports it
“unequivocally” against renewed European Union attempts to
overturn it, Roesler said, according to Handelsblatt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
