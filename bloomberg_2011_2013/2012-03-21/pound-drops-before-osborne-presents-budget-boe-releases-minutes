The pound slid for a third day
against the euro before Chancellor of the Exchequer  George
Osborne  presents a budget that analysts said will increase
annual gilt sales to the second biggest amount on record.  The drop pushed sterling to its lowest level in more than a
week against the 17-nation currency. The Bank of England is due
to release the minutes of its March 8 policy meeting, when
officials kept their bond-purchase plan at 325 billion pounds
($516 billion), after boosting it by 50 billion pounds the month
before. The Treasury will sell 180 billion pounds of bonds next
fiscal year, according to a Bloomberg survey of primary dealers
that trade directly with the nation’s debt office.  The pound depreciated 0.2 percent to 83.51 pence per euro
at 7:31 a.m. London time and reached 83.60 pence, the weakest
level since March 13. The U.K. currency traded at $1.5878.  Bank of England  Chief Economist  Spencer Dale  said yesterday
that U.K. inflation may not slow as much this year as the
central bank has forecast as tensions in the Middle East push up
 oil prices . The pound’s decline will aid the rebalancing of the
British economy, he said in a speech in Aberystwyth, Wales.  The  Office for National Statistics  will release details of
the U.K.’s net borrowing for February today.  Sterling has weakened 1.8 percent in the past year,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-market currencies. The euro slid 5.5 percent in the
same period.  Britain’s currency will end 2012 at 83 pence per euro and
$1.57, according to Bloomberg surveys of analysts of
strategists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
