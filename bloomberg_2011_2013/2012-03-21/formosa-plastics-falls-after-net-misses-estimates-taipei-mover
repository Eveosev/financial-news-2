Formosa Plastics Corp. (1301) ,  Taiwan ’s
biggest maker of polyvinyl chloride, fell to the lowest in more
than a month in Taipei trading after reporting lower 2011
earnings and dividend.  The shares declined 2 percent to NT$87.10 as of 1:30 p.m.
local time, the lowest close since Feb. 13. The  Taiex Index (TWSE)  rose
0.1 percent. The stock has gained 8 percent this year, trailing
the benchmark’s 13 percent advance.  Net income dropped 22 percent to NT$35.7 billion ($1.21
billion) last year, Formosa Plastics said in a statement
yesterday. The average of 15 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg News was for a profit of NT$38.6 billion. The company
plans to pay a cash dividend of NT$4 a share for 2011.  “Its cash dividend yield falls to 4.5 percent from more
than 5 percent over the past few years,” Jun Liao, vice
president at Taipei-based Grand Cathay Investment Services
Corp., said by telephone today. Liao has a neutral rating on the
stock and expects the company to post a NT$36.7 billion profit
this year.  Formosa Plastics’ board also approved a proposal to sell as
much as NT$12 billion of bonds, according to a separate
statement issued yesterday. The company said it plans to invest
an additional $170 million in a steel venture in  Vietnam .  To contact the reporter on this story:
