U.S. natural-gas supplies rose last
week, the earliest gain for this time of year since 2007, as
above-normal temperatures crimped demand, according to analyst
estimates compiled by  Bloomberg (DOENUSCH) .  Inventories expanded by 9 billion cubic feet, or 0.4
percent, to 2.378 trillion cubic feet in the week ended March
16, based on the median of 13 estimates. The five-year average
stockpile change for the week is a decrease of 17 billion,
according to the Energy Department.  “All it does is add to the overall bearish picture in the
market,” said Alan Lammey, an energy analyst with WeatherBell
Analytics LLC in Houston. “There is virtually no demand. You
don’t have any coming from lingering winter demand and summer
demand hasn’t come into play.”  Gas has tumbled 23 percent this year during the fourth-
warmest U.S. winter on record, according to the National
Climatic Center, while record production has contributed to a
supply surplus since September.  Stockpiles usually begin to increase at the end of March or
early April as heating-fuel use ebbs. Inventory levels rise
through the warm-weather months to have enough on hand to meet
peak demand during the following winter. The first increase
after last winter came in the week ended March 25.  The average temperature in  Philadelphia  on March 13 was 65
degrees Fahrenheit (18 Celsius), 23 above normal, according to
the  National Weather Service . The average in  Des Moines ,  Iowa ,
was 57 degrees, 19 above normal.  Heating Demand  Demand for heat in the U.S. was 60 percent below normal for
the week ended March 17 and 82 percent below normal in the
north-central states, according to Weather Derivatives in
Belton,  Missouri .  About 51 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  The stockpile estimates ranged from a decrease of 6 billion
cubic feet to an increase of 27 billion. The Energy Department’s
weekly supply report is scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m.
tomorrow in  Washington .  There is typically a wide range in storage estimates during
the transition period toward the end of winter and the beginning
of spring when gas demand tends to fall, said Lammey. He
predicts inventories may have increased by 9 billion to 12
billion last week based on pipeline flows.  An increase in inventories last week would end the
withdrawal season a week earlier than last year and two weeks
before the five-year average, according to department data.  Supplies were 52 percent above the five-year average in the
week ended March 9, the biggest gap since May 2006.  Natural gas futures rose 0.2 cent to $2.326 per million
British thermal units last week on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , after sliding on March 13 to $2.204, the lowest
intraday price since February 2002. Gas for April delivery fell
1.1 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $2.324 at 10:51 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
