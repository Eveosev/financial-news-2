Dubai’s benchmark stock index rose
the most in more than a week after dividend announcements by
companies including  Dubai Investments PJSC (DIC)  improved sentiment
and as oil rebounded.  Dubai Investments, the owner of stakes in more than 40
companies, advanced 5.1 percent.  Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB) , the
United Arab Emirates’ biggest bank complying with Shariah rules,
rose for the second time this week. The  DFM General Index (DFMGI) 
climbed 0.7 percent, the most since March 13, to 1,655.50 at the
2 p.m. close in the emirate.  The measure has rallied 22 percent this year as companies
posted improved earnings and dividends. The board of Dubai
Investments, which posted a 75 percent drop in 2011 profit,
recommended a full-year  cash dividend  of 5 fils a share. Dubai
Islamic said today it will pay a 2011  dividend of 12.5 fils a
share , more than the 10 fils it had proposed on March 1.  “The Dubai Investments dividend was a surprise and Dubai
Islamic Bank’s dividend was a surprise increase,” said Saad al Chalabi, an institutional trader at Al Ramz Securities in Abu
Dhabi. “That improved sentiment.”  Dubai Investments rose to 92 fils. Dubai Islamic, which
posted a 25 percent increase in full-year profit, advanced 1.4
percent to 2.22 dirhams.  Oil for May delivery rose as much as 0.7 percent to $106.86
a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange after an industry report showed crude stockpiles fell
in the U.S., the world’s biggest consumer of the commodity. Gulf
Arab oil exporters, including Qatar and the U.A.E., supply about
a fifth of the world’s oil.  Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  and the  Bloomberg
GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  advanced 0.3 percent. Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General
Index (ADSMI)  and  Kuwait’s Stock Exchange Price Index (KWSEIDX)  climbed 0.3
percent, while Bahrain’s  BB All Share Index (BHSEASI)  rose less than 0.1
percent. Oman’s  MSM 30 Index (MSM30)  was little changed and Qatar’s  QE
Index (DSM)  fell 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
