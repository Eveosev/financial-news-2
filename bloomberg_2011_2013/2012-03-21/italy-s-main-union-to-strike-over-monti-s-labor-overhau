Italy’s biggest union will hold a
general strike against Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s overhaul of
the nation’s labor laws, including an easing of firing rules,
after two months of talks failed to produce an agreement.  “The government thinks it can resolve Italy’s problems by
reducing workers’ rights,”  CGIL  head Susanna Camusso told
reporters in  Rome  today. Her union, the only one to oppose the
deal, announced an 8-hour general strike to protest the changes,
saying the date will depend on Parliament’s vote on the bill.
CGIL will also stage eight hours of strikes at individual firms.  Monti, who took over as premier from  Silvio Berlusconi  in
November, pledged to expand  jobless  benefits, reduce temporary
work contracts and allow more leeway in firing. The package
marks his fourth major legislative effort since coming to power
in November. He passed a 20 billion-euro ($26.5 billion)
austerity plan to balance the budget and revamp pensions,
followed by measures to boost competition and cut red tape.  “A strike by the CGIL is not going to unsettle the bond
markets,” said Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro
Sovereign Strategy in  London . “The markets, and many Italians
for that matter, have already bought into the narrative that Mr.
Monti is a genuine reformer and a showdown with the CGIL would
actually win him plaudits for facing down the unions.”  Improved Confidence  Monti’s steps to shore up public finances and spur Italy’s
economic growth, which has lagged behind the euro-region average
for more than a decade, has helped restore confidence in the
nation and bring down record borrowing costs. Italian 10-year
bonds yield 4.99 percent, down from 7 percent when he took over.  “There won’t be any signed agreement,” Monti said at a
 press conference  last night in Rome after leading the final
round of talks following two months of meetings with social
partners. “These negotiations were purely consultative,” he
said, adding that he wants to resolve the issue by next week.  With Monti forging ahead, the focus will now shift to
getting the plan through Parliament, where he will likely need
the support of the  Democratic Party , which is close to the CGIL.
Monti has said he wants the bill passed by the end of the month.  ‘High Standard’  “This agreement sets a high standard, as it would help to
make significant progress toward a more modern and flexible
labor market, and therefore encourage new hiring,” Fabio Fois,
a European economist at  Barclays Capital  in London, wrote in a
note to investors. “The current legal framework has led to a
two-tier labor market, with some workers overly protected with
open-ended contracts and another group of workers with fixed-
term contracts who lack  job security .”  Companies should now “double” their efforts to boost
“investments, growth and employment” because they will no
longer have the “excuse” of a rigid labor market, Monti said.
The premier said the changes will also help convince foreign
companies to expand in  Italy .  “Timing is fundamental,” Labor Minister Elsa Fornero said
last night. Dragging out the approval process would damage the
credibility of the effort, she said, declining to rule out the
Cabinet passing it as a decree to make the legislation take
effect before parliamentary passage.  Stefano Fassina, head of economic policy for the Democratic
Party, said in an interview with newspaper La Repubblica that
Article 18 had been “gutted.” The party would try to get the
plan changed before it goes to Parliament and propose amendments
in the legislature if necessary, he said.  “The question now is whether there will be any dilution in
the labor law legislation to assure passage,” said  Richard McGuire , senior fixed-income strategist at Rabobank
International in London, said.  Dismissals  Fornero said even under the new plan, dismissals without
just cause would still be illegal and companies would still risk
having to reinstate workers. Judges will also be able to order
reinstatement if they rule that a company unjustly claimed they
were firing staff for disciplinary reasons. The new rules would
allow companies to fire for economic reasons without risk of
reinstatement and workers would be entitled to as much as 27
months of compensation pay.  The package seeks to make the open-ended job contract the
cornerstone of Italy’s labor market, Fornero said. The
government wants to reduce structural unemployment and encourage
the hiring of young people and women through apprentice
contracts that lead to open-ended agreements, she said. Italy’s
 unemployment rate  tops 9.2 percent, the highest since 2001.  The package would also expand the system of  unemployment
benefits , which currently favor workers at the largest companies
who already enjoy the most job security. Fornero said the plan
will cost an additional 1.8 billion euros. Workers will be
eligible for 12 months of benefits, with anyone over 54
qualifying for 18 months.  -- With assistance from Flavia Rotondi in Rome. Editors:
