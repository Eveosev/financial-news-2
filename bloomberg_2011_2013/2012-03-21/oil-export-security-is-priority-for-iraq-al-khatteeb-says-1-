Securing outlets for the export of
Iraqi oil should tension with  Iran  disrupt Middle East supplies
is a priority, said Luay Jawad Al Khatteeb, the executive
director of the privately-funded Iraq Energy institute.  “It will need strategic planning and immediate action,”
Al Khatteeb said, referring to 4 million to 5 million barrels a
day of export capacity through  Saudi Arabia , Jordan or northern
Iraq. “That will require some time. This is not something of a
short-term resolution.”  Oil prices at $175 a barrel, “could be very much possible
under political and military threats on the Strait of Hormuz,”
Al Khatteeb said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. Brent
crude for May settlement traded at $124.50 a barrel today.  Iraq’s Cabinet approved measures to diversify crude-export
routes should Iran block the  Strait of Hormuz , a transit point
for about two-thirds of Iraqi production, State Minister Ali Al-
Dabbagh said this week.  Iraq Energy  is an independent research organization based
in London, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
