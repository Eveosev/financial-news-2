Territorial disputes in the  South
China Sea , rich in oil and natural gas reserves, require a quick
and peaceful resolution to boost energy production and meet
growing regional demand, a U.S. official said.  “You have this conundrum of a region that needs energy and
yet has a lot of territorial disputes or gray areas that inhibit
the ability to produce some of it,”  Robert Hormats , U.S.
undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy and the
environment, said today at a briefing in Hanoi. “These are
long-term investments, so you really need to start now if you’re
going to have the energy five years or 10 years out.”  Vietnam and the Philippines have rejected China’s map of
the South China Sea as a basis for joint oil and gas
development, leading to clashes in one of the world’s busiest
shipping lanes. China claims “indisputable sovereignty” over
most of the waters, including blocks off Vietnam that  Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and Russia’s  Gazprom OAO (GAZP)  are exploring.  Vietnam’s Foreign Ministry said March 15 that  Cnooc Ltd. (883) ’s
moves to develop the oil- and gas-rich northern areas of the
South China Sea violates its sovereignty. China’s biggest
offshore oil explorer opened bids to foreign companies last year
for  19 blocks  near the disputed Paracel Islands, according to
its website.  The South China Sea may hold 213 billion barrels of oil,
equivalent to 80 percent of Saudi Arabia’s reserves, according
to Chinese studies cited in 2008 by the U.S. Energy Information
Agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
