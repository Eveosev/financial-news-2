Crude oil options volatility fell
as the underlying futures rose after the Energy Department
reported that crude inventories declined for the first time in
five weeks.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 24.8 percent as of 4 p.m. in  New York ,
down from 25.6 percent in the previous session. The measure has
declined from 30.8 on March 6.  “Volatility was down a little because the market is higher
and it’s still back and forth in this range,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in New York.  Crude for May delivery rose $1.20 to settle at $107.27 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Since Feb. 21, the
front-month crude oil contract has traded in a range of $103.78
to $110.55.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
May $110 calls, with 3,114 lots changing hands as of 4:04 p.m.
They rose 25 cents to $1.65 a barrel. May $120 calls, the
second-most active options, fell 1 cent to 22 cents with 2,834
lots trading.  Calls accounted for 59 percent of electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Bullish options accounted for 55 percent of the 126,037
trades yesterday. May $100 puts were the most actively traded,
with 9,304 lots changing hands as they rose 40 cents to 98 cents
a barrel. The next-most-active options, May $110 calls, fell 82
cents to $140 on volume of 8,699.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 46,113
contracts. Next were December $150 calls with 38,604 lots and
December $100 calls with 34,926.  To contact the reporter on this story:
