South Korea’s won fell to a one-
week low as global stock declines and signs  China’s economy  is
slowing sapped demand for riskier assets. Bonds retreated.  Premier  Wen Jiabao  announced this month an economic growth
target of 7.5 percent for this year, down from an annual 8
percent over the past seven years. BHP Billiton Ltd., the
world’s biggest mining company, said yesterday  China ’s steel
production is slowing. The won extended losses as North Korea
threatened the South against raising the nuclear issue at a
security summit to be held in Seoul next week.  “The won’s decline is driven by reports that China’s
economy may slow,” said Lee Jin Ill, a Seoul-based currency
dealer at Hana Bank. “Currency drops will be limited though,
making the won move within a range, as negative reports about
China are already discounted.”  The won dropped 0.4 percent to 1,129.50 per dollar at the
close in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency touched 1,129.75, the weakest since March 15. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, fell one basis point to 8.23 percent.  The  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  of shares retreated 0.7 percent, falling
for a second day, after the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index snapped
a three-day gain in  New York .  The yield on the 3.25 percent notes due December 2014
climbed three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.62
percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. Three-year debt
futures declined 0.1 percent to 103.53. The one-year interest-
rate swap climbed one basis point to 3.57 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
