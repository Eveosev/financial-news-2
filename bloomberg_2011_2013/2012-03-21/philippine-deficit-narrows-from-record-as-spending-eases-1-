The  Philippines ’  budget deficit 
narrowed in January from a record after spending eased,
countering a decline in revenue.  The shortfall was 15.9 billion pesos ($370 million), the
government said in an e-mailed statement in Manila today,
compared with a previously reported deficit of 101.5 billion
pesos for December. That is the smallest since a surplus
reported in August. Spending rose 16.2 percent, compared with a
previously reported 43.2 percent increase in December. Revenue
dropped 7 percent, even as collection of taxes increased.  President  Benigno Aquino  is increasing spending to a record
this year while seeking $16 billion of investment in rail and
airports in an effort to create jobs and reduce poverty. The
World Bank and the  International Monetary Fund  have forecast
higher public spending and strong domestic demand will help
boost growth to 4.2 percent in 2012 from 3.7 percent in 2011.  “We expect tax revenues to continue improving owing to
administrative measures to further enhance compliance,”
Christian de Guzman, a Singapore-based assistant vice president
at Moody’s Investors Service, said before the data. Improvements
in both revenue and expenditure performance will continue in
2012, he said, with public spending supporting economic growth.  The nation won credit-rating upgrades from  Fitch Ratings 
and Moody’s last year after narrowing the budget gap to 2
percent of gross domestic product from 3.5 percent in 2010. The
government forecasts the shortfall will be 279 billion pesos in
2012, or 2.6 percent of GDP, as it increases expenditure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
