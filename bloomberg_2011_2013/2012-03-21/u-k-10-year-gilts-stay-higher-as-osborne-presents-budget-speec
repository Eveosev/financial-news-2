Ten-year gilts rose for a third day
as Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said the deficit
will drop next fiscal year amid government spending cuts and the
Debt Management Office trimmed its bond-sales target.  Longer-dated bonds outperformed two-year notes even as
Osborne said the Debt Management Office will explore issuing
debt with maturities of more than 50 years. The office said it
plans to sell 167.7 billion pounds ($266 billion) of gilts in
the year ending in March 2013, down from an estimated 179.4
billion pounds this year. Gilts declined earlier after a report
showed the deficit almost doubled last month.  The budget “reassured investors and that’s given some
support to gilts,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a strategist in
Edinburgh at RIA Capital Markets Ltd., a broker for banks.
“He’s committed to his medium-term fiscal-consolidation
program, and there will be no significant changes. That will
support gilts from the perspective of fiscal policy.”  The 10-year  yield  fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 2.37 percent at the 5 p.m. close of trading
in  London  after dropping to 2.36 percent, the lowest since March
15. The 4 percent security due March 2022 gained 0.48, or 4.80
pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 114.365.  Two-year yields  were little changed at 0.47 percent, while
the 30-year gilt yield slid five basis points to 3.41 percent.  The  extra yield  investors get for holding 30-year bonds
instead of two-year notes shrank five basis points to 294 basis
points. The spread has narrowed from a 2012 high of 300 basis
points on March 16.  Avoid Recession  The pound weakened 0.1 percent to $1.5851 after rising as
much as 0.4 percent to $1.5923. The currency was little changed
at 83.30 pence per euro.  Sterling has dropped 1.6 percent in the past year according
to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. The pound is little changed in
2012, the indexes show.  The U.K. will avoid a recession and the  unemployment rate 
will peak at 8.7 percent, Osborne said.  Osborne and Prime Minister  David Cameron  are seeking to
retain the U.K.’s top AAA credit rating by reducing a deficit
that’s now more than 8 percent of gross domestic product. The
shortfall will drop to 7.6 percent of GDP in the next fiscal
year, the  Office for Budget Responsibility  said.  ‘Support’ for Gilts  “The combination of fiscal orthodoxy and monetary policy
neutrality should lend gilts support going forward,” Moyeen Islam  and Henry Skeoch, strategists at  Barclays Capital  in
London, wrote in a client note. “The government has remained
firmly committed to a path of fiscal austerity. This should
provide some comfort to the rating agencies and also
international investors.”  Net borrowing excluding support for banks was 15.2 billion
pounds last month, the highest for any February on record,
compared with 8.9 billion pounds a year earlier, the  Office for
National Statistics  said in London.  Gilts have lost 3.1 percent this year, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies. The securities earned 17 percent last year,
the most among 26 indexes tracked by Effas, as investors sought
refuge from the euro-region’s debt crisis.  The government is considering issuing so-called perpetual
bonds in order to lock in lower borrowing costs, Osborne said.
The 10-year yield, which fell to a record low 1.92 percent on
Jan. 18, is more than 3 percentage points below its  average 
since March 1992, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The Debt Management Office will consult on the case for
issuing gilts with maturities longer than 50 years, and the case
for a perpetual gilt with no fixed redemption date,” Osborne
said in his speech. That is “something Britain last felt able
to issue six decades ago,” he said.  The yield on the 4 percent gilt maturing in January 2060
declined five basis points to 3.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
