Tingyi (Cayman Islands) Holding
Corp. (322) , China’s biggest maker of packaged food, said 2011 profit
dropped 12 percent, missing analysts’ estimates, hurt by higher
raw material costs and a slowing Chinese economy.  Net income  fell to $419.5 million from $476.8 million in
the year ended Dec. 31, Tingyi said in a statement to  Hong
Kong ’s stock exchange today. The figure compares with the
average estimate of $447 million of 16 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Sales for Tianjin-based Tingyi increased 18 percent
to $7.9 billion, it said.  Tingyi joins Chinese food companies, such as  Want Want
China Holdings Ltd. (151) , which have been hurt by higher raw material
costs and rising wages in the world’s second largest economy.
Tingyi was under pressure from rising labor costs and price
increases for raw materials such as flour, palm oil and sugar,
it said in the statement today. Gross margin fell to 26.54
percent from 28.43 percent a year earlier, according to the
statement.  Earnings this year will improve as “we do not expect gross
margin to continue to slide in 2012 as raw material costs have
shown signs of stabilization,” Charlie Chen, an analyst with
 BNP Paribas (BNP)  Securities  Asia  in Hong Kong, said in a telephone
interview. Chen has a ‘buy’ rating on the company.  Tingyi gained 0.6 percent to HK$23.55 at the close in Hong
Kong. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index slid 0.2 percent.  Challenging 2012  This year will be “challenging” as the development of the
Chinese economy, which has started to slow down and is affected
by the European debt crisis, “is likely to be full of twists
and turns,” the maker of Master Kong noodles and ready-to-drink
tea, said in the statement today.  China’s economic growth in 2011 slowed to 9.2 percent from
10.4 percent in 2010. Premier  Wen Jiabao  set a 2012 economic
growth target of 7.5 percent on March 5, lower than an 8 percent
goal in place since 2005.  Tingyi said Nov. 4 it will swap a stake in its beverage
business for PepsiCo Inc.’s bottling operations in  China . The
completion of the deal is still pending regulatory approval, the
noodle maker said today.  Under the agreement, Purchase, New York-based PepsiCo will
transfer equity interests in its bottling operations in China to
Tingyi-Asahi Beverages Holding Co. In exchange, PepsiCo will
receive a 5 percent stake in Tingyi-Asahi, with an option to
increase the shareholding to 20 percent by October 2015.  Tingyi will also make, sell and distribute PepsiCo’s
carbonated soft-drink and Gatorade brands, and co-brand its
juice products under the Tropicana label.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
