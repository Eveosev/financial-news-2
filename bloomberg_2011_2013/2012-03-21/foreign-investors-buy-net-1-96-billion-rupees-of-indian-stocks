Overseas  funds  bought a net  1.96
billion rupees  ($39 million) of Indian equities yesterday,
raising total investments in equities this year to 440.3 billion
rupees, according to the nation’s market regulator.  Foreigners bought 21.2 billion rupees of shares and sold
19.2 billion rupees, the Securities & Exchange Board of  India 
said on its  website  today.  They sold a net 9.09 billion rupees of bonds, paring their
inflow into debt this year to 230.4 billion rupees, the data
 show . They put 421 billion rupees in bonds in 2011.  Foreigners have invested 4.884 trillion rupees in stocks
and 1.438 trillion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993.  India’s $1.2 trillion stock market,  Asia ’s fifth-biggest,
is influenced by flows from overseas. Flows from abroad surged
to a record in 2010, making the Sensex the best performer among
the world’s top 10 markets. The largest-ever outflow in 2008 led
the biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  Offshore funds pulled out 27.1 billion rupees from local
equities last year, compared with record flows of 1.33 trillion
rupees in 2010, as  Europe ’s debt crisis threatened the global
economy and cooled demand for emerging-market assets. That led
to a 25 percent drop in the  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , the
second worst annual loss, and sent the rupee to an all-time low.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
