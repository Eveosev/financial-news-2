Saudi Arabia ’s mortgage market is
the least developed among the six Gulf Cooperation Council
states almost a year after advisers to the king approved an
overhaul of the mortgage law, CBRE Group Inc. said.  “Saudi Arabia has the largest real estate market in the
GCC, but the least developed mortgage market,” CBRE said in a
report today. “This has resulted in a shortage of owner-
occupied residential housing, particularly at the lower end of
the income scale.”  A package of reforms aimed at boosting private mortgage
lending hasn’t taken affect a year after the Shura Council
agreed on final amendments and passed it to King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz. CBRE said the delay is contributing to low mortgage
lending in the kingdom, where only 2 percent of home purchases
have been financed through mortgages. That compares with 17
percent in the  United Arab Emirates  and 70 percent in the U.K.  The Saudi monarch pledged to spend more than $82 billion to
fund homebuilding last year as political unrest swept the  Middle
East . The kingdom had about $150 billion worth of delayed public
projects as of December 2011, Los Angeles-based CBRE said,
citing the Jeddah Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  Contractual disputes, high prices of construction
materials, bureaucratic difficulties and a lack of manpower have
caused the delay, CBRE said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
