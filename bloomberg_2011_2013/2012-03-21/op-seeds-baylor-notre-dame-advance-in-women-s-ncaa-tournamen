Brittney Griner’s 25 points
included a dunk as she led undefeated, No. 1-seeded Baylor
University to a 76-57 win against ninth-seeded University of
 Florida  in the women’s national college basketball tournament.  No. 1 seed  Notre Dame  topped No. 8 California 73-62 last
night; fifth-seeded St. Bonaventure beat No. 13 Marist 66-63,
and fourth-seeded Georgia Tech eliminated No. 5 Georgetown 76-64.  Also last night, 11th-seeded Kansas upset No. 3 Delaware
70-64; second-seeded Duke beat No. 7 Vanderbilt 96-80; fourth-
seeded  Penn State  defeated No. 5 Louisiana State 90-80, and No.
3 St. John’s beat sixth-seeded Oklahoma 74-70.  Griner became the second player to dunk a ball in the
women’s  National Collegiate Athletic Association  tournament.
Candace Parker of Tennessee did it first, in 2006 in a game
against Army.  “I think my team got fired up a little bit more than me. I
got a little bit more fired up, I think, on one of the blocks I
had,” Griner told reporters. “But it definitely felt good
throwing it down.”  Baylor (36-0) advanced to the regional semifinals against
Georgia Tech (26-8) on March 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
