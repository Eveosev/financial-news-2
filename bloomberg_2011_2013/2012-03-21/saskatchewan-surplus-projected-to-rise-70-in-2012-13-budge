Saskatchewan’s budget surplus will
grow by 70 percent in the coming fiscal year, as the prairie
province benefits from higher royalties from resources such as
potash, the province said in a fiscal plan released today.  Finance Minister Ken Krawetz issued a 2012 budget today in
Regina that projects a C$95 million ($95.8 million) surplus,
before contributions to a provincial  reserve fund , in the fiscal
year that begins April 1. That’s up from C$55.8 billion in the
current fiscal year. Resource royalties, which make up more than
one-quarter of revenue, are projected to increase 14 percent.  Saskatchewan is getting a boost from growth in  China ,  India 
and other large developing economies, where rising demand for
protein-rich food and power investments are fueling demand for
potash and uranium.  Potash Corp. (POT) , the world’s largest fertilizer
producer by market value, and  Cameco Corp. (CCO) , the largest uranium
producer, both have their main producing mines in the province,
and oil production has increased along with prices.  “While other jurisdictions post deficits, Saskatchewan
will once again balance its budget,” Krawetz said in the
budget. “While other provinces struggle with sluggish growth,
Saskatchewan is projected to lead the nation.”  The budget forecasts surpluses averaging C$148 million in
the three fiscal years ending March 2016.  Growth to Slow  Saskatchewan’s budget forecasts growth will slow to 2.8
percent this year and 2.6 percent in 2013, from 3.6 percent in
2011. At 5 percent, Saskatchewan and Alberta have the lowest
 unemployment rate  of  Canada ’s 10 provinces.  Borrowing will rise to C$1.33 billion in 2012-13 from C$661
million this year, mostly to fund investments by government-run
corporations, led by the Saskatchewan Power Corporation,
according to the documents. Borrowing requirements for the
government are estimated at C$204 million, mostly to refinance
maturing debt, while requirements for state-owned corporations
are estimated at C$1.13 billion.  Public debt as a percentage of GDP is forecast to fall to
11.4 percent from 12.7 percent in 2011, budget documents show.  Total revenue is projected to grow 1.9 percent to C$11.3
billion, as falling transfers from the federal government and
lower revenue from state-owned businesses offset growing
resource royalties. Expenses are projected to grow 1.6 percent
in 2012-13 to C$11.2 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
