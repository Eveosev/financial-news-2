Rieter Holding AG (RIEN) , a Swiss textile
machinery-maker, will double its workforce in  China  to 1,800
employees over the next two years to expand in Asia, Chairman
Erwin Stoller said.  Rieter may also increase staff in  India  by about 25 percent
to 2,000 in the same period, Stoller said in an interview today
at Rieter’s annual results conference in Winterthur, where it’s
based.  The company got about a third of its 2011 sales from China
and India. Rieter today said earnings before interest and tax
rose to 112.6 million francs ($123 million) last year, missing
the 123.6 million-franc average of seven analysts’  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. The stock fell as much as 11 percent.  Rieter must manufacture machinery in India and China or
face being undercut by competitors in those countries who do not
have to pay  import taxes , Stoller said. The new hires in China
and India will not affect Swiss staff numbers, he said.  The company had 4,695 employees at the end of December.  Rieter traded 8 percent lower at 169.90 francs at 1:50 p.m.
in Zurich.  To contact the reporter on this story: Patrick Winters in Zurich
