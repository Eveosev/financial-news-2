Ethanol futures faltered for a
third day in  Chicago  after the Energy Department reported record
inventories of the biofuel.  Stockpiles (DOESFETH)  rose 3 percent to a record 22.7 million barrels
in the week ended March 16, the department said today. Supplies
have gained in 13 of the past 14 weeks.  “The U.S. continues to drown in an ocean of ethanol,”
said Mike Breitenbach, an analyst and trader at Blue Ocean
Brokerage LLC in New York. “This is a difficult environment for
producers.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery fell 1.4 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.286 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
lowest price since March 9. The decline extended the longest
streak of losses since Dec. 15. Prices have risen 3.8 percent
this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in the U.S.
Gulf at $2.30 a gallon and in  New York  the additive dropped 2
cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.335, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago decreased 1.5 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$2.275 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel slipped 1 cent
to $2.385.  To contact the reporter on this story:
