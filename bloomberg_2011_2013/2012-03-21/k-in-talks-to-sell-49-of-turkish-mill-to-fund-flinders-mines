OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel (MMK) ,
Russian billionaire Victor Rashnikov’s steelmaker, may sell 49
percent of its Turkish steel mill to help fund iron ore projects
in Australia, said Chief Executive Officer Boris Dubrovsky.  The steelmaker, known as MMK, is “in discussions” about
the possible sale of the stake in its MMK Metalurji mill in
Turkey with at least three local bidders, and may use the
proceeds to develop projects started by  Flinders Mines Ltd. (FMS)  in
Australia, Dubrovsky told reporters in Magnitogorsk today. The
sale depends on “a decent offer” and the mill reaching full
capacity, he said.  MMK is set to complete acquisition of Flinders for A$554
million ($580 million) next month and plans to invest A$1
billion to produce 15 million metric tons of  iron ore  by 2015 at
a currently untapped field.  MMK bought the 49 percent stake in the Turkish unit from
the Atakas family last year for $475 million, raising their
ownership to 100 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
