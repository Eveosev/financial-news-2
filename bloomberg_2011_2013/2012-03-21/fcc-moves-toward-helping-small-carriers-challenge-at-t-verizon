U.S. regulators moved toward
helping small mobile carriers challenge industry leaders  AT&T
Inc. (T)  and  Verizon Wireless .  The Federal Communications Commission voted 3-0 today to
ask whether rules are needed to ensure mobile devices can
operate on airwaves used by the two largest carriers and other
companies.  AT&T and Verizon are wary of an additional regulatory
burden, and small carriers say interoperability would ease
roaming by their customers onto the larger carriers’ airwaves,
 David Kaut  and  Christopher King , Stifel Nicolas & Co. analysts,
said in a note to investors today.  The agency also began removing barriers to  Dish Network
Corp. (DISH) ’s proposed mobile high-speed data network, voting 3-0 to
begin recasting rules that reserve the company’s recently
acquired airwaves for satellite use.  To contact the reporter on this story:
