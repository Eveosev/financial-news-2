Noble Group Ltd. (NOBL) , Asia’s biggest
listed commodities trader by sales, will delay marketing a $1.5
billion loan in general syndication, according to three people
familiar with the matter.  The company had planned to start marketing the loan in
general syndication today however some lenders approached to be
arrangers or senior banks requested more time to prepare, the
people said, asking not to be identified because the details are
private. The original deadline for potential arrangers to
respond to terms sent by Noble was last week. Some banks
requested extensions in order to process internal credit
approvals, the people said.  “There is no delay in our timetable,” Jeanny Kim, Noble’s
Hong Kong-based director of  capital markets , said in an e-mail
today. A public announcement will be made in due course, she
said.  Noble is offering to pay an all-in rate, which includes
margin and fees, of 290 basis points more than the London
interbank offered rate on a three-year tranche of the facility
and 190 basis points on a one-year tranche of the loan, another
person familiar with the matter said earlier this week.  The loan is expected to be split 40 percent into a one-year
maturity and 60 percent into a part that matures in three years.
Proceeds will refinance debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
