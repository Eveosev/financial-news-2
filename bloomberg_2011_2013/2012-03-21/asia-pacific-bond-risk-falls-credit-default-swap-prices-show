The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default decreased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia Series 17 index dropped 1 basis
point to 133 basis points as of 11:33 a.m. in Sydney, according
to Credit Agricole CIB. The Series 16 index closed at 124.9
yesterday, dropping from 180.5 on Dec. 30, prices from data
provider CMA show.  The Markit iTraxx Asia Series 17 index of 40 investment-
grade borrowers outside  Japan  fell 1 basis point to 150 basis
points as of 8:33 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Credit Agricole prices
show. The Series 16 gauge closed at 132.7 yesterday, tumbling 74
basis points in 2012, according to CMA, which is owned by CME
Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was at 154.5 basis points as
of 9:45 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. Series 17 of
the index started trading today.  Contracts on Mitsui Chemicals Inc. and Panasonic Corp. were
added to Japan’s index while Bridgestone Corp. and Tokyu Corp.
were dropped, according to information on Markit’s website.  New versions of the benchmarks are created every six months
when companies are added or dropped depending on their ratings,
cost of protection and ease of trading. The maturity date of the
new indexes is June 2017, compared with December 2016 on the
Series 16 versions.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
