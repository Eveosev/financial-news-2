Amar’e Stoudemire had 22 points and
12 rebounds as the  New York Knicks  beat the  Toronto Raptors  106-
87 to improve to 4-0 since Mike Woodson took over as interim
coach of the National Basketball Association team.  “Everybody feels great, having fun, enjoying the game of
basketball,” Stoudemire told reporters at Madison Square Garden
in  New York  last night. “That’s what it’s about. When you enjoy
doing your job, then it makes it much easier to play.”  The Knicks (22-24) are 15 games behind the Eastern
Conference-leading Chicago Bulls in the eighth and final playoff
place, a half game ahead of the Milwaukee Bucks, who defeated
the Portland Trail Blazers 116-87 last night. The Raptors (15-31)
are in 12th place.  Tonight, the Knicks are in Philadelphia to face the 76ers
(26-20), who are four games ahead of the Knicks atop the
Atlantic Division standings.  “I can’t worry about what Milwaukee and Philly does,”
Woodson said. “We got to handle our own business.”  Jeremy Lin had 18 points and 10 assists for the Knicks last
night, while  Tyson Chandler  and  Carmelo Anthony  each added 17
points.  DeMar DeRozan had 17 points and Andrea Bargnani added 15
for the Raptors.  “They’re a tenacious, different team,” Raptors Coach Dwane Casey said. “It’s amazing, their tenacity, the way they attack.
If you don’t meet it, it takes you right out. And the Garden was
a hot building tonight.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
