Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  plans to stream a new,
original series, “Hemlock Grove,” with 13 episodes beginning
in 2013.  The  Los Gatos , California-based online film and TV service
has exclusive rights to the program, a monster murder-mystery
based on a Brian McGreevy novel and starring Famke Janssen and
Bill Skarsgard, the company said today in a statement. Gaumont
International Television is producing the series.  Netflix is branching out from library content to offer new,
original programming to compete for subscription revenue with
Time Warner Inc.’s HBO. Netflix is considering partnerships with
cable operators to expand the reach of the online service, which
has more than 23 million streaming customers, Chief Executive
Officer  Reed Hastings  said this month.  “Hemlock Grove” will be available to Netflix customers
that pay $7.99 a month for its streaming service. Netflix
announced its first original series, the David Fincher-produced
“House of Cards,”  last year . The company is bankrolling the
new comedy “Orange Is the New Black,” according to a person
with knowledge of the situation.  Netflix also has picked up other exclusive distribution
rights. The Norwegian drama “Lilyhammer” is now available, and
new episodes of “Arrested Development” are scheduled for 2013.
By the middle of 2013, the company will have five original
series for streaming, according to  Ted Sarandos , chief content
officer.  Netflix rose 3.5 percent to $119.07 at 11:28 a.m. in  New
