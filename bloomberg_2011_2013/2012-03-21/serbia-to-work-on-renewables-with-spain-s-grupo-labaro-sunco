Elektroprivreda Srbije,  Serbia ’s
state-owned power monopoly, signed an accord with three Spanish
energy companies to raise production from renewable sources.  The Belgrade-base utility will work with  Spain ’s Grupo
Labaro, Barcelona-based  Energy Resources SA  and  Sunco Renewable
Energy  on planned wind farms, solar plants and biomass projects
whose “initial” installed capacity is seen at around 150
megawatts, said Elektroprivreda Executive Director Bratislav
Ceperkovic in Belgrade today. The company will sign another
memorandum of understanding with Spain’s  Institut Catala
d’Energia  on April 18.  The power monopoly produces a third of its 35,000 gigawatt-
hour annual output from hydroplants and needs to increase the
share from renewables to help improve Serbia’s overall energy
mix by 2020, said Ljubo Macic, head of Serbia’s  Energy Agency .
The aim is part of Serbia’s broader efforts to join the European
Union, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
