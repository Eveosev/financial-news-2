China Steel Corp. ,  Taiwan ’s largest
steelmaker, swung to a loss in the fourth quarter as weak demand
forced it to cut production.  The loss of NT$573 million ($19 million) for the three
months ended Dec.31 compared with profit of NT$4.53 billion a
year earlier, according to figures derived from full-year
earnings released today by the Kaohsiung-based company. That
missed the NT$638 million average estimate of seven analysts in
a survey compiled by Bloomberg.  China Steel (2002)  joins steel mill Posco in reporting lower
earnings after the debt crisis in  Europe  curbed global economic
growth and demand for the metal. The Taiwan-based mill cut
output by about 10 percent in 2011, as the island’s economic
growth slowed to 4.04 percent from 10.72 percent in 2010.  Full-year net income was NT$19.5 billion, the Taiwanese
company said today in a statement. That was 48 percent lower
than NT$37.6 billion reported for the previous year.  China Steel climbed 0.3 percent to NT$30.05 in Taipei
trading at the close and before the announcement. The stock has
risen 4.3 percent this year, compared with the 13 percent gain
in the benchmark Taiex index.  Investors will be paid a cash dividend of NT$1.01 share and
a stock dividend of 15 shares for every 1,000 shares held by
investors, the company said today.  Output totaled 8.76 million metric tons last year, the
 China Steel  said in an e-mailed statement Jan. 17. That compared
with 9.72 million tons a year earlier.  Consolidated net income of Posco, the world’s third-largest
steelmaker, fell to 3.7 trillion won ($3.3 billion) in the year
ended Dec. 31 from 4.19 trillion won a year earlier, the Pohang,
South Korea-based company said in a regulatory filing Feb. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
