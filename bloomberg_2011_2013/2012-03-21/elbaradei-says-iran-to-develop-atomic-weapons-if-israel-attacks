Mohamed ElBaradei , the former head
of the world’s atomic-energy watchdog, said an Israeli attack on
Iran’s nuclear facilities would only persuade the Islamic
republic to build a nuclear arsenal.  “You can bomb their facilities, but you cannot bomb their
knowledge,” ElBaradei, former director general of the
 International Atomic Energy Agency , said today in  Hong Kong .
“If you were to bomb Iranian facilities, there will be a lesson
for Iran -- to develop nuclear weapons.”  Israel accuses Iran of seeking to build nuclear weapons and
hasn’t ruled out a military strike to head off further
development. The U.S. and European Union have tightened
sanctions in an effort to persuade Iran to halt  uranium
enrichment  and allow international inspections of its program,
which it insists is for peaceful purposes.  ElBaradei, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who in January
decided not to run for president of Egypt, said Western
countries need Iran to help stabilize a region dealing with
conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and Lebanon.  “They both need each other,” he said. “Right now each
one is waiting for the other side to blink first and that is not
going to happen.”  Restoring law and order is the most important challenge
facing Arab countries that overthrew its leaders over the past
year, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
