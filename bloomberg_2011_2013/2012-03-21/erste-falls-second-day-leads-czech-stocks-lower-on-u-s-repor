Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  fell for a
second day, leading Czech stocks lower after a U.S. report
showed sales of previously owned homes unexpectedly fell in the
world’s largest economy, driving investors from riskier assets.  Austria’s Erste retreated 0.9 percent to 456 koruna by 4:08
p.m. in  Prague , poised for its biggest one-day decline since
March 12. The lender was the second-worst performer in the 14-
member  PX (PX)  equity index, which slid 0.1 percent, erasing earlier
gains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
