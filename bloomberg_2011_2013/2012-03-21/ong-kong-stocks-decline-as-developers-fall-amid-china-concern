Hong Kong  stocks  fell, with the
benchmark Hang Seng Index posting its longest losing streak
since December, as developers and automakers dropped amid
concern  China ’s economy is slowing.  Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. (16) , the world’s No. 1 developer
by market value, led a measure of real estate shares lower,
declining for a second day after an executive was arrested for
alleged bribery.  Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. (175)  fell 3 percent
on speculation growth in mainland car sales will miss an
industry group target.  Belle International Holdings Ltd. (1880) 
advanced 4.7 percent after the shoe retailer posted higher
profit on demand from wealthier shoppers.  “Investors are still concerned whether China’s economic
grow will slow even more,” said Patrick Yiu, associate director
at Cash Asset Management Ltd. in Hong Kong. “Unless property
prices move up sharply, I don’t think property shares at the
current level are attractive.”  The benchmark  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  slid 0.2 percent to 20,856.63
at the close in Hong Kong. The gauge fell for a fourth
consecutive day, its longest losing streak since Dec. 15. The
 Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies listed
in the city dropped 0.9 percent to 10,776.  Sun Hung Kai slid 1.7 percent to HK$111.10. The shares
declined 2.4 percent yesterday after an  executive director  was
arrested by the city’s anti-corruption body as part of an
investigation into alleged bribery.  Developers Drop  Property shares fell the most among the four industry
groups on the Hang Seng Index. The group surged 24 percent in
the first two months of this year, outperforming an 18 percent
advance by the benchmark index.  China Resources Land Ltd., a state-owned developer, fell
2.1 percent to HK$12.80 today.  Guangzhou R&F Properties Co. (2777)  sank
3.1 percent to HK$9.01 after  Apple Daily  said the developer
plans to cut its average selling price by 5 to 10 percent this
year. The report cited Co-Chairman Li Szelim.  “Property shares are having a correction after rally in
the first two months,” said Cash Asset’s Yiu. “I’m not
surprised there’s selling pressure.”  Futures on the Hang Seng Index expiring this month rose 0.1
percent to 20,909. The HSI  Volatility Index (VHSI)  eased 3.1 percent to
20.86, indicating options traders expect a swing of about 6
percent in the benchmark index over the next 30 days.  The Hang Seng Index has risen 11 percent this year through
yesterday amid signs the  U.S. economy  is improving and amid
speculation China will ease monetary policy. Shares in the Hang
Seng Index traded at 10.5 times estimated earnings yesterday,
compared with 13.5 times for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  and
11.2 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  China Car Sales  Carmakers dropped today after an official at the China
Association of Automobile Manufacturers yesterday said mainland
vehicle sales will probably miss their 8 percent growth forecast
this year. A slowing economy and rising fuel costs will limit
demand, the official said.  Geely Automotive dropped 3 percent to HK$2.88. Brilliance
China Automotive Holdings Ltd., a partner of Bayerische Motoren
Werke AG, retreated 1.3 percent to HK$8.28. BYD Co., the
mainland carmaker partly owned by  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire
Hathaway Inc., fell 3.1 percent to HK$20.55.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.3 percent
today. The gauge fell 0.3 percent in New York yesterday after
China raised fuel prices for the second time in less than six
weeks.  Among stocks that rose today in  Hong Kong , Belle
International Holdings  advanced 4.7 percent to HK$14.18 after
saying profit rose by 24 percent last year on demand from
wealthier shoppers. China’s largest retailer of women’s shoes
also said it would buy rival Big Step Ltd.  “Economic growth in China is still intact, and corporate
earnings are healthy,” said Cash Asset’s Yiu. “Investors are
still trying to buy good quality stocks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
