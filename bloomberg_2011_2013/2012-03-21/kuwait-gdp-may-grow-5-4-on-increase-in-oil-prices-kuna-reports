Kuwait’s gross domestic product may
grow as much as 5.4 percent for the fiscal year ended March 31,
 KUNA  reported, citing a study by the finance ministry’s
Department of Macroeconomic and Fiscal Policy.  GDP growth was spurred by higher  oil prices , the state-run
 news agency  said.  Kuwait, the fourth-largest oil producer in the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries, had the slowest GDP growth
among members of the Gulf Cooperation Council over the past five
years, according to International Monetary Fund data.  GDP expanded by an average 2.6 percent annually compared
with 4.2 percent in the United Arab Emirates, 5.7 percent in
Bahrain and 18 percent in Qatar, according to the IMF.  To contact the reporter on this story:
