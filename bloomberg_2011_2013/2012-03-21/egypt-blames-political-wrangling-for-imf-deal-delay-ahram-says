Political wrangling and “lack of
societal consensus” are responsible for delaying a $3.2 billion
loan agreement between Egypt and the  International Monetary
Fund ,  Al Ahram  cited Finance Minister Momtaz el-Saieed as
saying.  The  IMF  wants the government to submit an economic program
that has broad political support after the North African country
officially requested the loan in January. The Muslim
Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party, which makes up the
largest bloc in parliament, has said the government’s plan is
too vague.  To contact the reporter on this story:
