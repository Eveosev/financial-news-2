President  Richard Fisher  urged that large U.S. banks be split
apart because a highly concentrated financial system is
hindering economic expansion.  The “institutions that amplified and prolonged the recent
financial crisis remain a hindrance to full economic recovery
and to the very ideal of American capitalism,” Fisher said in
an essay in the Dallas Fed’s 2011 annual report posted online.
“Downsizing the behemoths over time into institutions that can
be prudently managed and regulated across borders is the
appropriate policy response.”  Fisher said the Dodd-Frank Act, passed in part to end
bailouts, has led to a “dangerous trend” of greater banking
concentration. He also reiterated that “the lackluster nature
of the recovery” is due to uncertainty around U.S. fiscal and
regulatory policies.  Fisher, 63, has been president of the Dallas Fed since
2005. His district includes  Texas , northern Louisiana and
southern  New Mexico .  To contact the reporters on this story:
