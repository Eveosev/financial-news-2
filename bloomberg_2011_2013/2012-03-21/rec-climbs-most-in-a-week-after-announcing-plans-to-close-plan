Renewable Energy Corp. ASA climbed
the most in almost a week in Oslo after announcing plans to
permanently close its Glomfjord plant in  Norway  amid weak demand
for solar wafers.  Shares in the Sandvika, Norway-based company gained as much
as 5 percent, the most since March 15, and traded 2 percent
higher at 3.738 kroner as of 9:09 a.m. in the Norwegian capital.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
