U.S.  Gulf Coast  gasoline
strengthened after Motiva Enterprises LLC reported a power
failure at its Port Arthur refinery in Texas.  “Operations followed stabilize, slow down, and shutdown
procedures to minimize emissions” after an electrical storm
knocked out power, the company said in a filing with the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality. The failure caused
emissions from a fluid catalytic cracker, the filing showed.  The premium for 87-octane RBOB  gasoline  in the Gulf Coast
widened 2.63 cents to 5.38 cents a gallon versus futures traded
on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 3:48 p.m., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Conventional 87-octane gasoline in New York strengthened 5
cents to a discount of 10.5 cents versus futures. The fuel has
gained 6.63 cents since  PBF Energy Inc. (PBF)  reported a fire at its
 Delaware  City refinery in Delaware on March 16.  The discount for the same gasoline in Chicago narrowed 0.5
cent to 6 cents a gallon versus futures. Prompt delivery fell
0.1 cent to $3.2971 a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
