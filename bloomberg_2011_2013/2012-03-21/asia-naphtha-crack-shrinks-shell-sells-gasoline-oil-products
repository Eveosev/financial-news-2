Asia ’s naphtha crack spread
narrowed for the first time in three days. Royal Dutch Shell Plc
sold gasoline and gasoil cargoes in  Singapore , the region’s
largest oil-trading center.  Light Distillates  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures
dropped to $131.97 a metric ton at 5:15 p.m. Singapore time from
$138.13 yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This
crack spread, a measure of refining profit, narrowed for the
first time since March 16.  Vitol Group sold 25,000 tons of open-specification  naphtha 
for delivery in the second half of May to Itochu Corp. at $1,079
a ton, according to a Bloomberg News survey of traders who
monitored transactions on the Platts window. Glencore
International Plc sold a May half-month swap to Marubeni Corp.
at $12 a ton.  BP Plc sold 50,000 barrels of  92-RON (MOGFC92S)  gasoline to Gracewood
Petroleum Ltd. and the same quantity to Trafigura Beheer BV at
$134.60 a barrel, the survey showed. Total SA also sold 50,000
barrels to Trafigura at $134.80 a barrel.  Shell sold 50,000 barrels of  95-RON (MOGFC95S)  grade to Gunvor Group
Ltd. at $136.70 a barrel, according to the survey.  Middle Distillates  Shell sold 250,000 barrels of  gasoil , or diesel, with 0.5
percent sulfur to Total, according to the Bloomberg survey. The
cargo, for loading April 6 to April 10, changed hands at 30
cents a barrel below benchmark quotes, the same discount
reported in last week’s transactions.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude rose 19 cents
to $15.49 a barrel at 2:23 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM
Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This  crack spread  widened for a
second day.  Jet fuel ’s premium to gasoil was unchanged after falling to
20 cents a barrel, PVM said. A narrower  regrade  indicates it is
less profitable to make  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Fuel Oil  BP bought two 20,000-ton cargoes of  180-centistoke (N6SHS180)  fuel oil
for loading April 10 to April 14, according to the Bloomberg
survey. Gunvor sold one shipment at $751 a ton and PetroChina Co.
sold the other at $3 a ton over benchmark quotes, the biggest
premium reported since Feb. 27.  Brightoil Petroleum Holdings Ltd. purchased 25,000 tons of
 380-centistoke (N6SHS380)  grade for a second day, paying $737.50 a ton to
Koch Industries Ltd., the survey showed. The cargo is for April
5 to April 9 loading.  Fuel oil climbed 2 cents to $6.83 a barrel below Dubai
crude at 2:24 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM. This
 discount  widened 22 percent over the previous two days,
signaling increased losses for refiners turning oil into
residual products.  The premium of 180-centistoke  fuel oil  to 380-centistoke
grade, or the  viscosity spread , declined 50 cents to $11.25 a
ton, PVM said. This means bunker, or marine fuel, decreased less
than higher-quality fuel oil.  Refinery News  Essar Oil Ltd. will complete a $1.6 billion expansion of
its Vadinar refinery by the end of this month, the company said
in an emailed statement. The operator of  India ’s second-largest
non-state refinery has started a vacuum gasoil hydrotreating
unit and a sulfur-recovery unit at the plant.  To contact the reporters on this story:
