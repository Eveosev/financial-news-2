Services in commodities hedging
provided by banks will shrink and the terms will be stricter
because of new regulations adopted since the global financial
crisis, Greenwich Associates said.  Regulations such as Dodd-Frank and Basel III will establish
stricter capital reserve requirements and require mandatory
central clearing for over-the-counter derivatives that will
reduce bank profits, the Stamford, Connecticut-based researcher
said in an e-mailed statement today. Companies hedge about 54
percent of their base-metals needs and 46 percent of their
precious-metals exposure, according to the study.  Banksâ€™ offerings of products and credit in the commodities
derivatives business may have peaked in 2011, Greenwich
Associates said. The business was dominated by two banks
servicing the  energy industry  a decade ago and has at least 10
bank and non-bank providers today, it said. Companies in  Asia 
are the most active in hedging and cover about 75 percent of
their base-metal exposure, while in  Canada  they cover 38
percent.  Hedges may also get shorter as banks seek to reduce long-
term risk, according to the study. About 54 percent of companies
hedge for a year or longer, Greenwich Associates said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
