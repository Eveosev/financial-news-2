ING Groep NV (INGA) , the largest Dutch
financial-services company, sold its 77 percent stake in the
owner of Warsaw’s Zlote Tarasy retail complex, cutting the value
of its real estate by 475 million euros ($630 million).  A fund managed by AXA Real Estate and CBRE Group Inc.’s
Property Fund Europe unit bought the shareholding, ING said in a
statement today. The Amsterdam-based company didn’t disclose the
purchase price.  “This is the final step in a project which we have been
involved in for the past 14 years,” Hein Brand, chief executive
officer of the ING Real Estate Development unit. “The sale
marks an important milestone in ING’s strategy to reduce its
exposure to real estate.”  Zlote Tarasy is a mall opposite Warsaw Central Railway
Station with more than 200 shops, a cinema and restaurants that
opened in 2007, according to its website. The property has
66,200 square meters (713,000 square feet) of retail space and
47,300 square meters of office space and attracts more than 20
million visitors a year, ING said.  The city of Warsaw owns the rest of the complex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
