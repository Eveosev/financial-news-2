Burundi’s government said it’s
spending 1 billion Burundian francs ($712,000) a month to help
stabilize fuel prices in the East African country.  The subsidies helped reduce gasoline prices to 2,080 francs
per liter from 2,332 per liter, Melchior Simbaruhije, spokesman
for Second Vice President Gervais Rufyikiri, told reporters
