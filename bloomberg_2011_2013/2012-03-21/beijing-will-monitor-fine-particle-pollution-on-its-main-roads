The city of Beijing will start
monitoring fine-particle pollution smaller than 2.5 micrometers
on 30 of its main roads, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported today.  The measurements of so-called PM 2.5 pollutants will be
made known regularly, Xinhua said, citing officials with the
municipal environment committee whom it did not identify.  Beijing aims to cut PM 2.5 levels by 15 percent by 2015
compared with 2010 levels, Xinhua said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
