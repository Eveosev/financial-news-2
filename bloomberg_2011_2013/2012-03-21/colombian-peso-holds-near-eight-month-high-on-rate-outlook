Colombia ’s peso fell from an eight-
month high after a report that showed sales of previously owned
houses in the U.S. unexpectedly fell last month damped demand
for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The peso weakened 0.1 percent to 1,759.56 per  U.S. dollar 
at the close in Bogota, after earlier touching 1,756.5, near the
strongest since July 22. It has jumped 10 percent this year, the
biggest advance among all currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The peso declined in line with Latin American currencies as
investors were discouraged from buying riskier assets after U.S.
housing sales trailed estimates, said Daniel Lozano, an analyst
at Serfinco SA brokerage in Bogota. “The mood wasn’t for a
strong move, but we saw the regional currencies fall,” he said.  Purchases of previously owned houses dropped 0.9 percent in
February to a 4.59 million annual rate from a revised 4.63
million pace in January that was the highest since May 2010, a
report from National Association of Realtors showed today in
 Washington . The median forecast among analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a rise to 4.61 million.  The peso may strengthen later this week if Colombia’s
national statistics agency reports 2011 annual growth above 6
percent, Lozano said. The gross domestic product report tomorrow
will show growth of 5.8 percent, according to the median
estimate of 30 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due July 2024 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point,
to 7.33 percent, according to the central bank.  Yields on Colombia’s inflation-linked peso bonds due in
2023 rose to 3.69 percent at a government auction today.  The yield on the securities, known as TES UVR, increased
from 3.54 percent at the last auction on Feb. 15.  Yields on inflation-linked debt due May 2017 rose to 3.26
percent from 3.02 percent while those on bonds due February 2015
climbed to 2.98 percent from 2.6 percent, the  Finance Ministry 
said in a statement. Demand for the three securities equaled 876
billion pesos ($498 million), more than double the 400 billion
pesos offered, the ministry said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
