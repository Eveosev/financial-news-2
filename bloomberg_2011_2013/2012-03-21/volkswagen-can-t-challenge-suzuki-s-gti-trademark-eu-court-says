The European Union’s general court
ruled  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  can’t challenge a trademark for SWIFT GTi
granted to  Suzuki Motor Corp. (7269)  by the EU’s Office for
Harmonisation in the Internal Market.  Volkswagen owns German and international trademarks for the
words GTI. The region’s highest court, the EU Court of Justice,
shouldn’t hear the challenge according to today’s decision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
