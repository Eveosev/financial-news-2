Shares of the following companies
had  unusual  moves in  Philippine (PASHR)  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close of trading in Manila.  The  Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PCOMP)  fell for a third day,
dropping 1.3 percent to 5,037.94. It’s the measure’s sharpest
loss since March 6.  Bloomberry Resorts Corp. (BLOOM)  (BLOOM PM) rose 1.4 percent to
35.50 pesos, snapping its worst two-day loss in a month. Major
infrastructure work has been completed at its casino-hotel
resort complex in Manila, the company said in a statement.  Jollibee Foods Corp. (JFC)  , the nation’s biggest
restaurant operator, increased 2.8 percent to 119.20 pesos, the
first gain in three days. The company is on the “lookout” for
acquisitions at home and overseas, Chief Executive Officer Tony Tan Caktiong said. The company may set  capital spending  this
year at four billion pesos ($93 million) to five billion pesos,
he said.  Nickel Asia Corp. (NIKL)  , the largest Philippine
producer of the metal, rose 11 percent to 28.30 pesos, the
highest close since the stock began trading in November 2010.
The shares climbed on speculation the company will benefit from
 Indonesia ’s move to implement a ban on nickel-ore sales sooner
than planned to boost output of refined nickel, according to
CitisecOnline.com. “Philippine nickel ore companies will
benefit most from this export ban,” George Ching, analyst at
Citisec, said. “Among listed companies, Nickel Asia will be the
main beneficiary because it’s a pure play on nickel.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
