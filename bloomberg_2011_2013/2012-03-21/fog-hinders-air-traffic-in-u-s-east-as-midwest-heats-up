Fog on the East Coast slowed some
air traffic as forecasters predicted that record-setting heat
across the U.S. Midwest, including  Chicago , may extend through
the end of the month.  Dense fog in parts of the East early today cut visibility
to less than a quarter-mile, causing flight delays of 20 minutes
at New York’s LaGuardia Airport and 37 minutes at Philadelphia
International, the Federal Aviation Administration said on its
website.  A dense fog advisory was posted until 10 a.m. for stretches
from North Carolina to  Massachusetts , the National Weather
Service said.  Chicago’s high yesterday was 85 Fahrenheit (29 Celsius),
surpassing the old record for the date of 76 set in 1921,
according to the  Weather Service . Other all-time highs for March
20 were set in Detroit, with 82;  Cleveland , 83; and
Indianapolis, which also reached 83, breaking a record set in
1894.  “Records continue to be not only broken but smashed across
northern  Illinois ,” said the weather service office in
Romeoville, Illinois. “In Chicago prior to this year there had
only been 10 days in March with highs in the 80s, which means on
average, Chicago only sees an 80-degree high once about every 14
years.”  Traders watch temperature predictions to gauge energy use
and demand. About 51 percent of U.S. households use natural gas
for heating, according to the Energy Department.  Natural gas futures traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  are down 22 percent this year because of a warmer-than-
average winter and high output that led to an inventory glut.  Chicago Record Threatened  Through yesterday, Chicago’s average temperature monthly
temperature has been 52.6, on pace to break the previous record
of 49.6 set in 1910 and 1945, according to the weather service.  The average daily temperature in Chicago has been at least
30 degrees above normal for the past four days and at least 20
above since March 12, according to weather service data.  “Thus at the current pace it is almost a certainty that
Chicago and Rockford will not only break but shatter their
current record warmest Marches,” the agency said.  Temperatures in Chicago are expected to be at least 18
degrees above normal through March 31, according to a 6- to 10-
day forecast from  David Salmon , owner of Weather Derivatives in
Belton, Missouri.  Across a large part of the East, temperatures are expected
to be 6 to 10 degrees above normal, Salmon said.  Seasonal East Possible  The only areas closer to seasonal temperatures next week
may be the West and East coasts, said  Matt Rogers , president of
Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland .  Before any potential cooling comes to the East Coast,
temperatures are expected to be warm through this week. Boston
may reach 78 today and 82 tomorrow, while Concord, New
Hampshire, may be 83 today and 84 tomorrow, according to the
weather service.  Highs in  New York ’s Central Park are forecast to be 72
today and 75 tomorrow and in  Washington , 76 today and 77
tomorrow.  The warm weather also extends to Canada, where highs today
may be about 73 in Toronto and 78 tomorrow, according to
Environment Canada.  The normal average temperature in New York on March 30 is
about 47 degrees, according to MDA EarthSat Weather in
Gaithersburg, Maryland. It’s 43 in Boston and Chicago, 52 in  St.
Louis , 58 in Atlanta, 61 in Dallas, 66 in Houston, 49 in Seattle
and 59 in Burbank,  California .  To contact the reporter on this story:
