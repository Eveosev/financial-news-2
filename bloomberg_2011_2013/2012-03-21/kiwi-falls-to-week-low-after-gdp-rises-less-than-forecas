The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars fell as a private report signaled Chinese manufacturing
may contract for a fifth month, stoking speculation demand will
slow for the South Pacific nations’ exports.  The so-called Aussie slid versus most of its 16 major
counterparts as investors boosted expectations of an interest-
rate cut by the  Reserve Bank  of  Australia . New Zealand’s
currency dropped to a two-month low after data showed fourth-
quarter gross domestic product expanded at half the pace
economists estimated.  China  is Australia’s biggest trading
partner and New Zealand’s second-largest export destination.  “The momentum is clearly slowing in China, as indeed the
authorities have tried to ensure,” said Callum Henderson,
global head of currency research at Standard Chartered Plc in
Singapore. “The bias in the Aussie is clearly lower.”  The Australian dollar lost 0.9 percent to $1.0368 at 11:43
a.m. in  New York  after earlier sliding to $1.0336, the weakest
since Jan. 17. It dropped 1.8 percent to 85.69 yen. New
Zealand’s currency fell 0.9 percent to 80.84 U.S. cents after
earlier reaching 80.59, the lowest level since Jan. 25. The so-
called kiwi declined 1.8 percent to 66.80 yen.  The HSBC Flash China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’
Index fell to 48.1 in March. That’s the lowest level in four
months and compares with a final reading of 49.6 for February on
the gauge which is published by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics. Figures below 50 indicate contraction.  New Zealand’s  GDP (NZNTGDPC)  rose 0.3 percent in the three months
ended Dec. 31 from the previous quarter, when it increased a
revised 0.7 percent, a statistics bureau report today showed.
The median projection in a Bloomberg survey of economists was
for 0.6 percent growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
