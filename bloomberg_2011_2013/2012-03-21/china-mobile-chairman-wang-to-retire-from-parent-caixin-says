China Mobile Communications Corp. (CHMOBZ) 
Chairman  Wang Jianzhou  will retire tomorrow and be replaced by
vice-chairman Xi Guohua, Caixin reported, citing internal
communications at the phone carrier.  The change will extend the role of Xi, who is also
Communist Party secretary at China Mobile, according to the
report. Rainie Lei, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman at the
carrier, didn’t immediately reply to phone calls and an e-mail
seeking comment.  Wang, 63, has overseen operations at China Mobile since
joining the nation’s biggest wireless carrier in 2004 from
smaller rival China United Telecommunications Corp. Xi, a former
vice minister of Industry and Information Technology, joined
China Mobile last year.  China Mobile Ltd. (941) , the Hong Kong-listed unit of state-owned
China Mobile Communications, rose 2.5 percent to HK$83.20 as of
2:29 p.m. local time today, compared with a 0.3 percent drop in
the benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
