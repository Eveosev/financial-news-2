Corn fell, heading for the biggest
three-day drop since January on speculation that rising U.S.
ethanol stockpiles will slow demand for the grain, boosting
supply.  Ethanol  inventories  rose 3 percent to a record 22.7 million
barrels in the week ended March 16, up 13 percent from a year
earlier, the Energy Department said today in a report.
 Production (DOETFETH)  fell to 893,000 barrels a day last week, compared
with 913,000 a year earlier. The amount of ethanol  blended  with
gasoline fell 0.6 percent last week from a week earlier.  “Ethanol demand is slowing because high gasoline prices
are cutting consumer driving and U.S. exports have slowed,”
Brian Grete, a senior market analyst for Professional Farmers of
America newsletter in  Cedar Falls ,  Iowa , said in a telephone
interview. “It’s a concern because it can lead to rising corn
supplies.”  Corn futures for May delivery dropped 0.4 percent to
$6.4475 a bushel at 12:20 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade,
down 4.2 percent since March 16, heading for the biggest three-
day slide since Jan. 13. Earlier, the commodity reached $6.425,
the lowest since March 12.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
