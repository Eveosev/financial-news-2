A surge in 10-year  yields  may be
coming to an end after they reached a technical barrier,
according to Shin Kong Life Insurance Co., citing trading
patterns.  Treasury rates climbed to 2.40 percent yesterday, above the
so-called upper  Bollinger band  level of 2.37 percent. It was
also the highest level since October.  “The current level is oversold,” said Will Tseng, who
trades  U.S. debt  at Taipei-based Shin Kong Life, which has the
equivalent of $52.2 billion in assets. Investors should “jump
in” to buy, based on the indicator, he said.  Bollinger bands gauge volatility by plotting standard
deviations above and below a moving average. Analysts use them
to determine a probable range for a rate or security.  Ten-year yields were higher than the upper Bollinger level
from March 14 through yesterday. The rate was 2.37 percent today
as of 8:18 a.m. in  London , versus the current Bollinger level of
2.41 percent.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
