Miratorg Agribusiness Holding,
 Russia â€™s largest pork and animal-feed producer, plans to triple
its breeding cattle to 112,000 cows by the beginning of next
year in a bid to start its own beef output.  The company shipped about 11,500 Aberdeen-Angus cattle from
the U.S. and  Australia  in the 10 days through March 19, bringing
its breeding cattle to 37,000 cows, said Head of Public
Relations Dmitriy Lgovskiy.  Miratorg expects its total commercial cattle herd to reach
about 265,000 cows, including breeding stock, and its beef
output capacity to be about 50,000 metric tons a year after
2014, Lgovskiy said today by telephone from Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
