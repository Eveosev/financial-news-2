A nursing shortage in the U.S. that
led to a decade-long push for new hires and more graduates in
the field is over, at least until 2020 when a glut of retirees
will leave a new gap to fill, researchers said.  The number of full-time nurses grew by about 386,000 from
2005 to 2010 and about a third of the growth occurred as
 unemployment  rose to a high of 10 percent during that period,
according to a report published in the  New England Journal of
Medicine .  The increase in the nursing workforce from 2005 to 2010 was
the largest of any five-year period during the last 40 years,
the authors said. Hospitals began experiencing a shortage of
nurses in 1998, according to the American Hospital Association
in 2002.  “It’s really been a long-standing shortage,”  Douglas
Staiger , the study author and a professor of economics at
 Dartmouth College  in Hanover,  New Hampshire , said in a March 19
telephone interview. “Probably for the first time in memory
there were actually reports of nurses having difficulty finding
jobs and reports from hospitals of almost a glut of nurses.”  In the early part of this century, many registered nurses
were leaving the profession saying they were overworked,
underpaid and unable to provide good patient care, according to
a 2002 report in the New England Journal of Medicine. Hospitals
responded by encouraging people to become nurses by offering
more benefits, signing bonuses, scholarships and tuition
reimbursement.  Graduates Double  Those efforts paid off as the number of people who
graduated from entry-level baccalaureate nursing programs more
than doubled to 161,540 in 2010 from 72,986 in 2000, according
to the  American Association of Colleges of Nursing  based in
 Washington .  The gains continued unabated even as the recession began in
2007 as nurses who had left the work force or were employed
part-time returned to full-time work to shore up family
finances, said Staiger.  As the economy improves, and the mostly married, female
workforce quits, reduces working hours to part time or reaches
retirement age, a shortage of nurses is expected again. The
renewed need for nurses will hit just as demand for health care
increases as more Americans gain medical insurance under
provisions of the U.S. health-care law that goes into effect in
2014, Staiger said.  “We had suspected that the supply of nurses is counter
cyclical, when the economy goes down, nurses work more, pile
back into work in part because the jobs are there,” he said.
“The concern was this was a temporary surge into the labor
market, a bubble, and as soon as the economy recovered, a lot of
nurses would exit and we would be back and the shortage would
emerge.  Bigger Shortage  “Going ahead into 2020 and beyond, there are concerns that
the kind of shortages we’ve had will be larger than what we’ve
seen,” Staiger said.  The nursing workforce is now expected to grow about 109,000
full-time positions from 2010 to 2015, as the economy improves
and by 227,000 if the economic downturn persists, the authors
said.  The authors used data from a workforce model to compare the
U.S. unemployment rate with the difference between the actual
size of the nurse workforce and the model’s expected size over
40 years. They were then able to project what effect the
recession had on the workforce in 2005 and 2010 and what effects
an improving economy would have beyond 2010.  Changing Job Market  They found that from 2010 and 2015, 118,000 nurses will
stop working full time as the economy grows.  “The nursing shortage is likely to re-emerge and nursing
is going to continue to be a good occupation choice for young
people,” Staiger said.  The current median age of nurses is 46 years, while the
largest group is in their 50s, according  American Association  of
Colleges of Nursing.  Polly Bednash , chief executive officer of the group, said
she’s worried the report will lead policy makers to think they
don’t need to invest in the nursing field.  “We need to put all the support we can into keeping the
pipeline robust,” she said in a March 19 telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
