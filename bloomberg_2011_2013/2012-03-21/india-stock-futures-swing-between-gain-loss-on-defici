Indian stocks climbed the most in
Asia as overseas funds continued to buy local shares even amid
concerns weakening government finances may slow economic growth.  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) , the nation’s largest
software maker, rose the most in about four months.  Larsen &
Toubro Ltd. (LT) , the biggest engineering company, jumped 4.6
percent, ending four days of losses.  DLF Ltd. (DLFU) , the biggest
developer, climbed the most in three weeks.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, advanced 1.7
percent to 17,601.71 at the close in Mumbai. Foreign funds have
 bought  a net $8.9 billion of local shares this year, a record
for the period, even as corporate-profit growth slows,  interest
rates  remain at a three-year high,  oil prices  jump and the
government struggles to tackle a widening fiscal gap.  “A rally here has to be led by foreign money because you
don’t have a catalyst in the local market,” Sadanand Shetty, a
senior fund manager at Taurus Asset Management Co., which
manages about $910 million, said by phone today. “Foreign flows
is the only trigger left for a sustained rally.”  Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  missed his deficit target
by the most in three years and forecast the fiscal gap would
narrow to 5.1 percent in the year from April 1. The gap in the
year ending March 31 will be 5.9 percent of GDP, more than the
goal set last year, he said on March 16.  Aside from increasing taxes, Mukherjee proposed capping a
subsidy program spanning diesel and cooking gas to fertilizers
to less than 2 percent of GDP, starting in the year ending in
March 2013. Higher oil prices deepen losses for state refiners,
which are forced to sell fuels below cost to cap prices.  Brent
crude , the benchmark for almost all of  India ’s imports, is up 16
percent this year, fueling inflation and limiting the RBI’s
scope to reduce interest rates.  Monetary Policy  The Sensex has risen 14 percent this year as  foreign funds 
made purchases on optimism slowing inflation will spur the RBI
to ease monetary policy. The gauge trades at 15.5 times future
earnings, compared with 10.7 times on the MSCI Emerging Markets
Index. The central bank left the benchmark rate unchanged at a
policy meeting on March 15 after a record 13 increases between
March 2010 and October last year.  “The market had run a little bit ahead of itself on what
the RBI could do,” Andrew Holland, chief executive officer of
investment advisory at Mumbai-based Ambit Capital Pvt., told
Bloomberg UTV today. “After the budget, perhaps the quantum of
the rate cuts has been tempered down somewhat.”  The S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India added 1.7 percent to 5,364.95. Its April futures settled
at 5,438.55. India VIX, which measures the cost of protection
against declines in the Nifty, lost 4.3 percent to 21. The  BSE
200 Index (BSE200)  gained 1.8 percent to 2,185.65.  A combined 913 million shares changed hands on the BSE and
NSE yesterday, equivalent to the daily average of 915 million
shares in the past year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Software Shares  Tata Consultancy Services surged 3.6 percent to 1,175.75
rupees, its steepest climb since Dec. 2. JPMorgan Chase & Co.
analyst Viju K George raised the price estimate on the company
to 1,300 rupees from 1,250 rupees, while keeping the overweight
rating unchanged, according to a report dated yesterday. The
stock may outperform the average total return of the stocks
covered by the analyst in the next six to twelve months, the
report said.  Infosys Ltd. (INFO) , the second-biggest software exporter,
rose 1.9 percent to 2,882.1 rupees.  Larsen & Toubro soared 4.8 percent to 1,346.4 rupees,
ending a four day, 7.8 percent declined. DLF added 4 percent to
203.55 rupees.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , the most valuable
company, rose 1 percent to 768.05 rupees.  TTK Prestige Ltd. (TTKPT) , a kitchen appliances maker, surged the
most in 14 months after it was rated buy in new coverage at CLSA
Asia-Pacific Markets with a price estimate 26 percent higher
than yesterday’s close. The stock rallied 14 percent to 3,179.65
rupees, the biggest gainer on the  BSE-500 Index. (BSE500)   Overseas  investors  bought a net  1.96 billion rupees  ($39
million) of local stocks yesterday, raising total investments in
equities this year to 440.3 billion rupees, according to the
nation’s market regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
