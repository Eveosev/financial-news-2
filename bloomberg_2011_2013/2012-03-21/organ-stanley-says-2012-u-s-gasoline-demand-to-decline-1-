U.S. gasoline demand will probably
decline this year after peaking in 2007 amid changes to
consumption, Morgan Stanley said in a report.  Demand dropped by as much as 190,000 barrels a day in the
first two months of 2012 based on the bank’s calculations,
 Hussein Allidina , head of commodities research, said today in
the e-mailed report. Consumption fell to 8.7 million barrels a
day last year from a record 9.3 million barrels in 2007, it said
without citing the source of the data.  “This fall is both a result of cyclical and structural
factors and see improving fuel efficiency and changing driving
patterns as likely limiting gasoline demand growth in the
future,” Allidina said in the report.  As crude costs increased, gasoline prices rose, leading to
a decline in usage as fewer miles are travelled. Gasoline has
gained 25 percent this year on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Demand will fall by 80,000 barrels a day from 2012 to 2017,
even as the economy recovers from next year, on improving  fuel
efficiency  from new vehicles, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
