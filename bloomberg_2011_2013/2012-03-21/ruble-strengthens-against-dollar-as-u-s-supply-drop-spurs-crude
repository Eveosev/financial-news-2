The ruble strengthened against the
central bank’s target dollar-euro basket and yields on local-
currency debt fell after a report showed U.S. crude stockpiles
dropped last week, signaling higher demand for  Russia ’s chief
export earner.  The ruble appreciated as much as 0.2 percent before trading
up 0.1 percent at 33.4865 against the basket at the close in
Moscow, paring yesterday’s loss. Russia’s 114 billion rubles
($3.9 billion) of local OFZ bonds due March 2021 rose for the
first day in three, pushing the yield down one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 7.82 percent.  Crude futures gained 0.4 percent to $106.54 per barrel in
 New York  after the Americal Petroleum Institute said U.S.
supplies shrank by 1.4 million barrels last week. Oil and gas
together provide about 17 percent of Russia’s gross domestic
product and 50 percent of state revenue, according to government
estimates.  “Stable global prices,  oil prices  especially, are the main
reason,” Vladimir Musyankov, senior currency trader at OAO
TransCreditBank in Moscow, said by e-mail. “Taxes to be paid in
Russia next week are also contributing to the strong ruble.”  A total 900 billion rubles ($31 billion) may be due in
taxes this month, Alexei Moiseev, chief economist at VTB Capital
in Moscow, said by e-mail March 20. Exporters convert foreign
exchange revenues into rubles to pay the government in the
second half of every month, boosting the Russian currency.  “People are waiting for a huge supply of dollars from
exporters due to the tax period this and next week, so they’re
keeping short on the basket” against the ruble, Aleksey Kulakov, a currency trader at OAO Promsvyazbank in Moscow, said
by e-mail.  The ruble was 0.2 percent stronger at 38.64 per euro and
steady at 29.27 per dollar. Investors increased bets on the
currency weakening, with non-deliverable forwards showing the
ruble at 29.6497 per dollar in three months, compared with
expectations of 29.6288 per dollar yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
