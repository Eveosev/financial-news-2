U.S. stocks may drop by as much as
5 percent in the next two weeks as the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index has reached the peak of a five-wave formation, according
to technical analysts at UBS AG.  “The  S&P 500 (SPX)  is trading in a wave 5, which suggests the
market is on its way to a first important tactical top,”
Michael Riesner and Marc Mueller wrote in a note yesterday.
“The current rally is driven by fewer and fewer stocks and this
is usually something we see at the end of rallies or bull
moves.”  The Zurich-based analysts said a setback could last as long
as 10 days, dragging the  benchmark gauge  for U.S. equities to
retest the 1,340 level. The number of stocks trading above their
respective 20-day moving averages as well as the number of new
52-week highs continue to decline, they wrote.  The wave theory holds that stocks move in alternating waves
of impulse and correction. A five-wave rally is typically
followed by a three-wave decrease.  The  S&P 500  slipped 0.3 percent to 1,405.52 yesterday. The
measure has rallied 12 percent so far this year amid better-
than-forecast economic and corporate data.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study price
