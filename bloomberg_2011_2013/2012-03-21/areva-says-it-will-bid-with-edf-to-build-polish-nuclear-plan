Areva SA (AREVA)  Chief Executive Officer
Luc Oursel said the nuclear reactor maker will make a joint bid
with French power utility  Electricite de France SA  to build an
atomic plant in  Poland .  “For the construction of the plant, we’ll bid with EDF,”
the CEO of the Paris-based nuclear company said at a senate
hearing in the French capital today. “It’s possible that the
Polish utility will ask EDF or others to invest in the plant and
bring their operational experience.”  PGE SA (PGE) , Poland’s largest utility, wants to start a tender
within the next two months for a technology provider for a
planned nuclear power plant, Chief Financial Officer Wojciech Ostrowski said March 14.  Areva is bidding to provide nuclear reactors in China,
India, the U.K., Finland and the  Czech Republic , and is
currently building plants in France, Finland and  China , said
Oursel. The company has said it expects use of atomic power to
increase, helped by the need to cut reliance on fossil fuels and
reduce carbon emissions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
