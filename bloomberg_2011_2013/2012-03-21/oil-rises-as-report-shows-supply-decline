Oil rose, rebounding from the
biggest drop in three months, after an industry report showed
U.S. inventories dropped for the first time in six weeks.  Futures climbed as much as 0.7 percent after the  American
Petroleum Institute  said yesterday that supplies fell 1.37
million barrels last week. A government report at 10:30 a.m. in
 Washington  will show stockpiles gained 2.2 million, a Bloomberg
News survey showed. Prices retreated from the day’s high as the
dollar rebounded from near a two-week low versus the euro.  “We rose overnight on the API numbers and are still
looking for the 10:30 report to show a build of about 2 million
barrels,” said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research
at Tradition Energy in Stamford,  Connecticut . “Expectations of
a gain will keep a lid on prices until the release.”  Crude for May delivery increased 44 cents, or 0.4 percent,
to $106.51 a barrel at 9:30 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract traded between $106.06 and $106.86 today.
Futures are up 7.8 percent this year.  Brent oil for May settlement gained 24 cents to $124.36 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  The dollar traded at $1.3232 per euro, up from $1.3285
earlier today.  U.S.  gasoline stockpiles  decreased 2 million barrels in the
week ended March 16, according to the median estimate of 11
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News before today’s Energy
Department report. Yesterday, the API said supplies slid 1.39
million barrels.  Saudi Output  Futures in New York dropped 2.3 percent yesterday after
Saudi Arabia’s Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said his country can
increase output by 25 percent immediately if necessary. The
country has capacity to pump 12.5 million barrels a day and will
pump about 9.9 million barrels a day this month and in April, he
said yesterday in Doha, Qatar.  Brent crude  rallied 11 percent last month, the most in a
year, on concern EU and U.S. sanctions against  Iran’s nuclear
program  will disrupt oil shipments. The Persian Gulf nation has
threatened to shut the Strait of Hormuz, a transit route for a
fifth of the world’s oil supplies, in response to an embargo.  ICE Futures Europe will set interval price limits, or
“circuit breakers,” on crude, gasoil and gasoline contracts
from April 1 to prevent large, fast moves, the exchange said in
a statement yesterday.  Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude price movements
will be limited to $1.25 per 3 seconds. Gasoil price swings will
be capped at $10. Gasoline and heating oil moves will be limited
to 3 cents per 3-second period, it said.  “Circuit breakers are all well and good, but right now in
the Brent market I’m not sure there’s a need,” said  Michael Hewson , an analyst at CMC Markets in  London , which handles about
$240 million a day in U.S. crude contracts. “They could be
announcing this if they were concerned about sharp moves in the
price, but that hasn’t happened yet. Brent hasn’t been
displaying spikey tendencies.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
