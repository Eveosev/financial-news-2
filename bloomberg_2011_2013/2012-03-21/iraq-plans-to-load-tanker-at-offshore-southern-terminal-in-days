Iraq, with the fifth-largest oil
reserves, will load a tanker in the next few days from a
southern offshore terminal halted because of unfavorable
weather, said  Asim Jihad , an oil ministry spokesman.  “It is hopeful that today or tomorrow an oil tanker will
anchor to be supplied with oil,” Jihad said today from  Baghdad .
The terminal stopped operations from March 13 because of weather
“problems” rather than technical issues, Jihad said.  Iraq is the third-largest oil producer in the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries, pumping 2.76 million barrels a
day in February, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporters on this story:
