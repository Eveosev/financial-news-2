Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL) , sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s third-biggest airline, dropped the most in a week on
concern dilution from its rights offer may outweigh the positive
effect of the company’s expansion plan.  The stock fell as much as 6.2 percent to 13.60 shillings
before trading 1.7 percent lower at 14.25 shillings by the close
in Nairobi, the biggest fall since March 14.  The airline will offer 1.48 billion shares, issuing 16 for
every five held at 14 shillings each from April 2 to April 18 to
raise $250 million, the company said March 12. The shares have
fallen 17 percent since that date. On an intraday basis, the
stock fell below its proposed offer price today.  “The concern among investors is how quickly the money
raised will start generating income for the business because of
the level of dilution of the value of existing shares,” Eric Musau, a research analyst at Nairobi-based Standard Investment
Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
