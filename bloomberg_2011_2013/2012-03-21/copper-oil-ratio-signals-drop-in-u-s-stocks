Commodity prices are signaling this
year’s rally in U.S. stocks will fade, according to Gina  Martin Adams , a Wells Fargo & Co. strategist.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows how she drew this conclusion: by
comparing the ratio between copper and crude-oil futures with
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  “When copper is accelerating faster than  oil prices ,
stocks tend to do particularly well,” Martin Adams wrote two
days ago in a report with a similar chart. “Much the opposite
has been the case recently.”  From this year’s peak on Feb. 6, the ratio fell 9 percent
through yesterday. The S&P 500 advanced 4.6 percent during the
same period.  “The direction of copper is historically one of the best
leading indicators” of global economic growth, the New York-
based strategist wrote. This contributes to the copper-to-oil
ratio’s usefulness as a stock-market gauge, the report said.  Price moves affecting the ratio can make or break earnings
estimates, Martin Adams added. Her projection of $102 a share in
 S&P 500  profit this year assumes commodity costs will be little
changed. Copper rose 11 percent for the year through yesterday,
and oil rose 6.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
