Wolfgang Kubicki, the Free
Democratic Party’s candidate to stand for premier of the German
state of Schleswig-Holstein, said the country’s top income tax
rate should be increased to 49 percent from 45 percent, Der
 Tagesspiegel  reported, citing an interview.  Kubicki said the government should use the additional
revenue to lower the burden on workers whose wages have been
pushed into higher tax brackets by inflation without increasing
their purchasing power, a situation known as bracket creep, the
Berlin-based newspaper said.  Schleswig-Holstein holds elections on May 6. The Free
Democrats are  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s junior coalition
partner at the national level.  To contact the reporter on this story:
