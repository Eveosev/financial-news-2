About 100 people in Burkina Faso,
blocked a road to protest the lack of local employment at
 Iamgold Corp. (IMG) ’s Essakane mine, said Mathieu Soubeiga, a resident
of the area.  “They were scattered by the police,” he said by phone
today from Dori, the main town in the region that is located
about 70 kilometers (43.5 miles) from the mine.  The company had received the complaint from the residents
on March 15 and talks were being held, said Ibrahim Ag Mohamed,
a spokesman for Essakane SA.  “We are surprised by this break of dialog,” he said by
phone. The company and Burkina Faso’s Mines Ministry will meet
with the residents on March 23, Mohamed said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
