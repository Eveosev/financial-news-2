The U.K. plans to almost double its
carbon surcharge, a measure aimed at spurring investment in
nuclear and renewables generation, in its second year.  The so-called carbon price support was set at 9.55 pounds
($15.13) a metric ton for 2014, according to a  budget document 
posted today on the U.K. Treasury’s website. That compares with
4.94 pounds from April 2013, when the policy takes effect.  U.K. power producers burning fossil fuels like gas and coal
will have to pay the government surcharge, which is calculated
two years in advance, in addition to buying European Union
permits to cover emissions. There is a risk utilities will end
up paying more for emissions should EU allowances rise,
according to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.  “Setting the  tax rate  two years in advance relative to a
volatile commodity is fraught with challenges,” Jonathan Grant,
director at PricewaterhouseCoopers’s sustainability and climate
change unit in London, said today by e-mail.  Britain is seeking to cut  carbon emissions  by 34 percent by
2020.  RWE AG (RWE) ,  Europe ’s biggest carbon emitter, and  Drax Group
Plc (DRX) , owner of the largest power station in western Europe, say
the levy makes it hard for them to sell power forward.  EU allowances for 2014 plunged 56 percent in the last year
and were at 8.61 euros a ton as of 4:50 p.m. on London’s ICE
Futures Europe exchange. The price averaged 14.39 euros in the
year to the end of February.  The price support is intended to bridge the gap between EU
permit prices and the U.K.’s carbon floor, which has been set
through 2020 and determines the minimum level industries will
pay to emit. The carbon floor starts at 16 pounds a ton in 2013,
rising to 30 pounds by 2020.  The U.K. Treasury calculates the carbon support two years
in advance. The 2014 support will be based on the average price
of EU allowance futures for that year in the twelve months to
February 2012, according to documents posted previously on the
Treasury’s website. The measure will raise 1.7 billion pounds in
its first two years, today’s  documents show .  To contact the reporter on this story:
