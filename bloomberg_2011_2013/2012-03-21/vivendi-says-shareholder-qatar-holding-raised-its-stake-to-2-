Vivendi SA (VIV) , owner of the world’s
largest music and video-game makers, said Qatar Holding raised
its stake in the company to 2 percent, as the Persian Gulf
country invests more in French companies.  Vivendi rose as much as 2.7 percent after the Paris-based
company said in its annual report that Qatar Holding, founded by
sovereign fund Qatar Investment Authority, acquired 5.6 million
Vivendi shares to boost its stake as of February 29 from the
1.55 percent it owned at the end of 2011. The stake is worth
about 354 million euros at the stock’s recent price.  The fund also raised its stake in  France ’s largest
publisher,  Lagardere SCA (MMB) , to 12.8 percent, local stock market
regulator AMF said two days ago.  Shares of Vivendi traded 1.4 percent higher at 14.19 euros
as of 11:18 a.m. in Paris.  Vivendi was not immediately able to comment. A spokesman
for Qatar Holding could not be reached by phone for comment.  Vivendi’s annual report also showed Chief Executive Officer
 Jean-Bernard Levy ’s total compensation was raised 10 percent to
4.46 million euros in 2011, including the value of  stock options 
as of Dec. 31.  The CEO has forecast a profit decline through 2013 as the
French mobile-phone unit SFR faces tougher competition and
falling prices at home.  Levy’s total 2011 compensation was worth 3.85 million euros
based on the value of Vivendi shares on March 13, the report
also said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
