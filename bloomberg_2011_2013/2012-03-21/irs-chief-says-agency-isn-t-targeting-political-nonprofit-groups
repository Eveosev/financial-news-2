The U.S.  Internal Revenue Service 
hasn’t been “targeting” particular nonprofit groups engaged in
political activity, Commissioner  Douglas Shulman  said today.  Republicans have expressed concern that the IRS was
singling out Tea Party-backed groups for extra scrutiny in
deciding whether to grant them tax-exempt status.  Shulman said today the groups applied for 501(c)(4) status,
a nonprofit status for “social welfare” organizations whose
primary activity isn’t political.  “All of these organizations are not being examined,” he
told a U.S. House Appropriations subcommittee. “They
voluntarily came in and said: I’d like to apply for 501(c)(4)
status.”  Shulman said a rotating three-person committee of IRS
career appointees reviews political activity and makes decisions
about how the agency addresses that issue in audits.  “There’s many safeguards built in so this has nothing to
do with election cycles and politics,” he said. “This notion
that we’re targeting anyone is off.”  Shulman said the groups could have begun operating with
501(c)(4) status without seeking IRS approval and then been
subject to audits only if the agency chose to examine them.  To contact the reporter on this story:
