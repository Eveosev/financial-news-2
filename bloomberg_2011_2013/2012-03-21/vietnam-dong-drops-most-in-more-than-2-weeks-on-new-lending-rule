Vietnam ’s dong declined the most in
more than two weeks on speculation companies are buying dollars
ahead of a new rule restricting foreign-currency loans.
 Government bonds  fell.  Commercial banks are being asked to restrict dollar lending
to some companies that need greenbacks to pay for imported
products such as fuel, and will now need central bank approval,
according to a statement on the  State Bank  of Vietnam’s website
March 9. The new rule takes effect from May 2.  “Demand for the dollar is increasing because from May 2,
the central bank will restrict lending in foreign currencies,”
said Cao Tan Phat, a Ho Chi Minh City-based analyst at ACB
Securities Co. “As the deadline is coming, companies are
rushing to buy dollars.”  The dong fell 1 percent to 21,034 per dollar as of 5:21 p.m.
in Hanoi, the biggest drop since March 2, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank set the  reference rate 
at 20,828, unchanged since Dec 26, its website showed. The
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
the official rate.  The State Bank of Vietnam is also lowering lenders’ long or
short foreign-currency position limits to the equivalent of 20
percent of their capital, according to a statement on its
website today. The new regulation, also effective May 2,
replaces a previous limit of 30 percent.  Yields (GGVN5YR)  on the five-year bonds rose three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 11.53 percent, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
