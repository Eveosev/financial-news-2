Romania ’s competition regulator is
investigating  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) ’s subsidiary in the country
for possible abuse of its market position.  The Romanian Competition Council conducted several
unannounced inspections at Hewlett-Packard Romania after
receiving a complaint about a possible breach of Romanian and
European Union competition rules, the regulator said in an e-
mailed statement today.  “We have suspicions about a possible abuse of dominant
position of HP Romania displayed through discriminatory behavior
in its relationship with one of its contractual partners,”
 Bogdan Chiritoiu , who heads the competition council, said in the
statement.  Radu Enache, HP’s Romanian country manager, declined to
comment on the investigation when contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
