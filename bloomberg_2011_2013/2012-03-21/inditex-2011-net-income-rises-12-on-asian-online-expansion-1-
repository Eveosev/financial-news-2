Inditex SA (ITX) , the world’s largest
clothing retailer, reported a 12 percent increase in full-year
profit as sales were boosted by openings in  Asia  and unveiled
plans to maintain store expansion over the next three years.  Net income rose to 1.93 billion euros ($2.56 billion) in
the 12 months ended Jan. 31, the Arteixo, Spain-based owner of
the Zara chain said today in a statement. The average of 15
estimates compiled by Bloomberg was 1.92 billion euros.  Inditex added 483 outlets in the year, boosting overall
selling space by 9.7 percent and the number of outlets to 5,527
in 82 countries. The retailer will be able to keep up space
growth of 8 percent to 10 percent in the next three years, Chief
Executive Officer Pablo Isla said. Inditex also reported
stronger sales for the first six weeks of the financial year.  “Inditex 2011 earnings were really strong and sales
performance at the beginning of this year is pretty good too,”
said Jose Rito, an analyst at Banco BPI in Porto,  Portugal .  Inditex advanced 0.6 percent to 72.20 euros, extending a
 winning streak  to eight days, the longest since 2007.  The retailer said it plans to open 480 to 520 stores in
2012, including its first Massimo Dutti stores in the U.S. The
expansion will lead to an increase in  capital spending  to about
950 million euros from 864 million euros a year earlier.  Online Stores  Zara plans to start online sales in  China  in the fall,
according to Inditex, which gets about two-thirds of  revenue 
from  Europe . As of September, all of the retailer’s brands had
online stores, and it offered e-commerce in 18 European markets,
as well as the U.S. and  Japan .  Net sales last year rose to 13.79 billion euros,
representing growth of 10 percent, or 11 percent at local
currency rates, Inditex said. Store revenue at constant exchange
rates climbed 11 percent from Feb. 1 to March 14, it said.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization climbed 9.8 percent to 3.26 billion euros as the
company’s gross margin remained at 59.3 percent of sales.  Some analysts were disappointed by a year-end  net cash 
total of 3.47 billion euros, which Rito said was lower than he
had expected. A dividend of 1.8 euros a share compared with the
1.81-euro average estimate of 25 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
