Instinet Inc., a New York-based
alternative trading-venue operator, and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,
have agreed to link their  Asia-Pacific (MXAP)  dark pools, giving
clients access to each other’s platforms in Hong Kong, Japan and
Australia.  Instinet’s clients can access 22 dark pools, private
trading venues that don’t publicly display prices, in Asia,
including 13 from individual brokers, Glenn Lesko, chief
executive officer in Asia for Instinet told Bloomberg News in a
telephone interview March 20. JPMorgan spokeswoman Marie Cheung
confirmed the contents of an Instinet press release announcing
the agreement.  Less than 2 percent of transactions in Asia occur through
dark pools, according to  Investment Technology Group Inc. (ITG) , a New
York-based brokerage. Dark pools account for 13.5 percent of
trading in the U.S. and 4.6 percent of shares changing hands in
 Europe , according to data compiled by Rosenblatt Securities Inc.  “There is proliferation of new pools in the region,”
Lesko said. “JPMorgan is one of the bigger brokers with lots of
liquidity in Asia that’s getting their dark pool going. We’re
looking to help them by providing our flow into there and
reciprocally, we we would benefit from their liquidity.”  Earlier this month, Instinet announced that it would
introduce another of its electronic-trading platforms, VWAP
Cross, into Hong Kong and Europe. The tool uses the so-called
volume-weighted average price, in which orders are matched from
buyers and sellers who are willing to wait for the market to
generate a price over time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
