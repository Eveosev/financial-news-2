The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
dropped 0.1 percent to 991.8 by the close of trading in Prague.  The following were among the most active  equities  on the
Prague Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)   of  Austria  fell 0.6 percent
to 457.5 koruna, a second day of losses. European stocks dropped
after a U.S. report showed that sales of previously owned houses
unexpectedly declined in the world’s biggest economy.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)  , the biggest Czech coking-
coal producer, rose 0.6 percent to 130.1 koruna, rebounding from
the lowest in three months. The stock slumped 10 percent in the
previous four sessions, sending its 14-day relative strength
index to 26.4 yesterday. Readings below 30 suggest to technical
analysts that a security may rise. The RSI rose to 28 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
