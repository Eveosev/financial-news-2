Illinois farmland values surged as
much as 21 percent last year on rising profits from growing corn
and soybeans, the Society of Professional Farm Managers and
Rural Appraiser said today.  Highly productive land rose to $10,460 an acre at the end
of 2011, up 20 percent from $8,690 at the start of the year,
farm managers said in a survey released today. The value of
average-quality farmland rose 21 percent to $7,330 an acre last
year. Land-price increases exceeded the 6.7 average from 1970 to
2011, the association said in a release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
