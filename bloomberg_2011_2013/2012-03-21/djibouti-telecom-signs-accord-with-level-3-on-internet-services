Djibouti Telecom SA, the Horn of
Africa nation’s only mobile-phone operator, said it signed a
partnership agreement with  Level 3 Communications Inc. (LVLT)  to
provide an Internet network.  The agreement forms part of a plan to make Djibouti an
“indispensable hub of telecommunications in the region,”
Director-General Abdurahman Mohamed Hassan told reporters in the
capital, Djibouti City, on March 19.  Level 3, based in Broomfield,  Colorado , is a broadband-
services provider.  Djibouti is about the size of  Massachusetts . The country
has a $982 million economy with fewer than 1 million people that
relies on services related to its strategic location on the  Red
Sea , one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, according to the
U.S. State Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
