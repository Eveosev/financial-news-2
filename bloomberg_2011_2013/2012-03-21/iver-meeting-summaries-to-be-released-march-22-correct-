Summaries of data to be presented
at a liver disease conference in Barcelona next month will be
made available to meeting participants on March 22, according to
the conference organizer.  Studies will be presented at the European Association for
the Study of the Liver meeting on drugs from companies including
 Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD) ,  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) ,  Abbott
Laboratories (ABT)  and  Medivir AB. (MVIRB)  The conference runs from April
18-22.  Kenes Group, the conference organizer, said yesterday the
summaries were to be released next week, later than originally
scheduled, because of technical difficulties. The problem has
been since resolved, the company said.  Participants, including doctors, brokerage analysts and
investors, will need to obtain a login and password to access
the abstracts, Kenes said. The contents wonâ€™t be made widely
available until the conference starts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
