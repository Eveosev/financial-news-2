Dubai Investments PJSC (DIC)  led gains in
Dubai’s  benchmark stock index  after the board recommended a cash
dividend even after posting a 75 percent drop in full-year
profit.  The shares surged 5.1 percent, the most since March 11, to
92 fils at the 2 p.m. close in Dubai. The stock led the  DFM
General Index (DFMGI)  0.7 percent higher to 1,655.50. Dubai Investments,
whose portfolio compromises more than 40 companies, recommended
a 5-fil dividend for last year.  “No one expected them to give a dividend” after 2011
earnings tumbled, said Saad al Chalabi, an institutional trader
at Al Ramz Securities in  Abu Dhabi .  Dubai Investments was hurt by a drop in the sheikhdom’s
real-estate market, which crashed on the heels of the 2008
global credit crisis and sent  home prices  plunging more than 60
percent from their peak that year. Cash on the companies balance
sheet dropped 71 percent between 2008 and 2010 to 399 million
dirhams ($109 million) and profit fell for a  third year in 2011 .  Dubai Investments paid a 6-fil dividend for 2010 and 2009,
according to  data compiled by Bloomberg.   To contact the reporter on this story:
