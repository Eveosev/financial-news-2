Mauritius’s central bank is
“closely” tracking reports about  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ’s sale of
its retail unit in the country, said Governor Rundheersing Bheenick.  “The central bank is monitoring the situation very closely
ever since HSBC announced its intention to dispose of its
domestic retail operation,” he said in an e-mailed response to
questions today. He declined to provide details.  Port Louis-based Capital newspaper reported that AfrAsia
Bank Ltd., a closely held lender, has probably acquired the
retail business of HSBC in the Indian Ocean island nation,
without saying where it obtained the information.  “It would be premature at this stage to speculate on the
outcome, and it really isn’t appropriate to comment on rumors or
speculation,” Amelie Desvaux de Marigny, spokeswoman for HSBC,
said in an e-mailed response to questions today from Ebene,
south of the capital,  Port Louis .  AfrAsia’s Port Louis-based spokeswoman, Suneeta Motala, is
in  Zimbabwe  and couldn’t immediately be reached for comment,
according to a person who answered her phone.  Bheenick said in a transcript of an  interview  published on
its website on March 19 that HSBC wants to sell its retail
segment to free up capital and focus on its offshore business.  London-based HSBC is “looking to reshape” its business
for sustainable profit growth and HSBC Mauritius is part of the
review, said Desvaux de Marigny.  To contact the reporter on this story:
