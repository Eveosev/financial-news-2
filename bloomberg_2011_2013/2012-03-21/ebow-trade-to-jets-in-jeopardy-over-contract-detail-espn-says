Financial language in  Tim Tebow ’s
contract with the  Denver Broncos  may nullify his trade to the
 New York Jets , according to ESPN.  Tebow has about “$5 million worth of recapture language”
in his contract -- money the Broncos already paid him that they
would recoup if he were to retire before completing the deal --
and Denver is asking the Jets to compensate them to complete the
agreement,  ESPN.com said  citing an unidentified person with the
Broncos.  The same issue caused complications for the  Jacksonville
Jaguars  when they tried to acquire Tebow, ESPN said.  The Jets agreed to send fourth- and sixth-round draft picks
to Denver for Tebow and a seventh-round pick, ESPN said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
