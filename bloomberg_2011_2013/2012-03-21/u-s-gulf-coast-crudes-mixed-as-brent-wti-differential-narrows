U.S. Gulf Coast oil premiums were
mixed as the spread between West Texas Intermediate and Brent
crudes narrowed.  Brent’s premium over WTI, based on May futures contracts,
decreased 85 cents to $17.20 a barrel at 2:06 p.m. in  New York .
When Brent loses versus WTI, it weakens the value of low-sulfur
U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced against
the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s (USCSLLSS)  premium widened 55 cents to $22.80
over the U.S. benchmark at 2:12 p.m. in New York, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet (USCSHLSE) ’s premium
gained 75 cents to $23 a barrel.  Thunder Horse  lost 50 cents to $19.75 a barrel over WTI and
 Mars Blend (USCSMARS)  decreased 30 cents to a premium of $14.70. Poseidon’s
premium lost 35 cents to $13.90, while Southern Green Canyon’s
premium added 25 cents to $14.75.  West Texas Sour (USCSWTSM) ’s discount widened 25 cents to $6 a barrel.  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS) ’s discount widened $1.50 to $30 a
barrel. Bakken oil was unchanged at $15.50 a barrel under WTI,
and Syncrude’s discount narrowed 75 cents to $9.25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
