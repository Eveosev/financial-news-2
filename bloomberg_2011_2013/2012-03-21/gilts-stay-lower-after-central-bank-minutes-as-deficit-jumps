U.K. five-year notes snapped a two-
day advance before Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne 
presents next year’s budget and as a report showed the deficit
almost doubled last month as taxes fell and spending surged.  Short-dated gilts stayed lower after the  Bank of England 
said two policymakers voted for more stimulus this month. Net
borrowing excluding support for banks climbed to 15.2 billion
pounds ($24.1 billion), the highest for any February on record,
from 8.9 billion pounds a year earlier, the Office for National
Statistics said in  London  today. The Treasury may sell the
second-largest amount of gilts on record this year, analysts
said before Osborne’s speech at about 12:30 p.m.  “With the budget around the corner, it’s not pleasant
viewing” for bond investors, said  Orlando Green , a fixed-income
strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in
London. “Gilt investors need to see that the government is
focused on its deficit-cutting targets.”  The  yield  on the five-year gilt increased two basis points
to 1.23 percent at 11:31 a.m. London time, while the two-year
note yield also rose two basis points, to 0.49 percent. The 1.75
percent security due January 2017 fell 0.08, or 80 pence per
1,000-pound face amount, to 102.46. The 10-year yield was little
changed at 2.43 percent.  BOE Minutes  Adam Posen  and  David Miles  wanted to increase the bank’s
target for bond purchases by 25 billion pounds to 350 billion
pounds, while the rest of the Monetary Policy Committee favored
waiting and monitoring the “substantial risks” to the
inflation outlook, minutes of the March 7-8 meeting released
today in London showed.  The pound was little changed at $1.5868, after gaining as
much as 0.4 percent to $1.5923. It was 0.1 percent weaker versus
the euro at 83.47 pence.  “The debt figures took the wind out of the sails a bit”
for the pound, said  Neil Mellor , a currency strategist at Bank
of New York Mellon Corp. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
