Gold exports from  Tanzania , which
vies with  Mali  to be Africa’s third-biggest producer of the
metal, jumped 49 percent in the year through November, the Bank
of Tanzania said.  Shipments increased to $2.2 billion from $1.48 billion a
year earlier, the Dar es Salaam-based central bank said in a
statement on its website today.  The East African nation’s current account deficit widened
75 percent to $4.3 billion, as imports grew 32 percent to $11.5
billion, it said. Imported oil volumes increased 16 percent to
3.6 million metric tons, “partly associated with increased
demand for thermal power generation,” the bank said. The value
of oil imports surged 50 percent to $2.96 billion.  Exports climbed to $6.7 billion from $5.6 billion on higher
world gold prices, the bank said.  “The improvement was largely on account of increases in
gold prices in the world market, traditional exports and travel
receipts,” it said. Gold jumped 26 percent to $1,746.38 per
ounce by Nov. 30 from a year earlier, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The debt of the region’s second-biggest economy grew to
$12.58 billion at the end of November, while gross official
reserves totaled $3.48 billion, compared with $3.7 billion a
year earlier, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
