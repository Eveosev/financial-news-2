Asian  stocks  slid, with the
benchmark index heading toward a one-week low, as companies
including  China  Rongsheng Heavy Industries Group Holdings Ltd.
posted weaker earnings and Australia cut its commodity sales
forecast on concern China’s economy is slowing.  China Rongsheng, the biggest shipbuilder listed in  Hong
Kong , declined 8.1 percent after profit tumbled 59 percent.
 Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. (175)  fell 3 percent on speculation
growth in mainland car sales will miss targets.  BHP Billiton
Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s biggest mining company, slipped 1.7 percent in
Sydney after copper futures slid the most in two weeks
yesterday.  “People are starting to realize that things are not as
great as initially thought,” said Lee King Fuei, a Singapore-
based fund manager at Schroders Plc, which oversees about $326
billion of assets globally. “There’s a risk of much slower
growth in China should bad debts climb and banks raise capital
or restrict lending.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  fell 0.9 percent to 125.93 as
of 9:48 p.m. in  Tokyo , poised for its lowest close since March
7. The measure climbed 12 percent this year through yesterday as
signs the  U.S. economy  is improving boosted confidence in the
outlook for Asia’s exporters. The rally boosted the value of
stocks on the gauge to 15 times  estimated earnings  on average
yesterday, compared with 13.5 times for the S&P 500 and 11.2
times for the Stoxx 600.  Nikkei 225  Eight of the 10 biggest drags on the Asian benchmark today
were companies listed in Japan, as declines caught up with
losses in the region yesterday when markets in Tokyo and Osaka
were closed for a holiday. The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  lost 0.6
percent. The MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index fell 0.4.  South Korea’s Kospi Index decreased 0.7 percent,
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index dropped 0.5 percent. Hong Kong’s
Hang Seng Index declined 0.2 percent. China’s Shanghai Composite
Index added 0.1 percent after rising as much as 0.8 percent and
falling as much as 0.7 percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The gauge fell 0.3 percent in  New York  yesterday
as China raised fuel prices for the second time in less than six
weeks, stoking concern growth in the world’s fastest-growing
major economy may slow.  China Rongsheng declined 8.1 percent to HK$2.17 in Hong
Kong. Second-half profit tumbled 59 percent to 504 million yuan
($80 million), based on annual results announced yesterday,
after the shipyard only delivered one mega-commodity vessel to
Vale SA.  Earnings Performance  Kathmandu Holdings Ltd. (KMD)  also fell after posting falling
earnings. The producer of outdoor clothing and equipment slumped
14 percent to NZ$1.62 in Wellington after first-half profit
dropped 43 percent.  Of the 602 companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index that
 reported earnings  since Jan. 9, 56 percent have missed analysts’
estimates, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  David Jones Ltd. (DJS) , Australia’s second-largest department
store chain, sank 11 percent to A$2.43 in Sydney after
forecasting its smallest profit in six years. The retailer said
it is boosting spending on outlets and its website to stem
falling sales.  Carmakers dropped today after an official at the China
Association of Automobile Manufacturers yesterday said mainland
vehicle sales will probably miss their 8 percent growth forecast
this year. A slowing economy and rising fuel costs will limit
demand, the official said.  Geely Falls  Geely Automotive dropped 3 percent to HK$2.88.  Brilliance
China Automotive Holdings Ltd. (1114) , a partner of Bayerische Motoren
Werke AG, retreated 1.3 percent to HK$8.28.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,
which gets about 17 percent of sales in Asia excluding Japan,
slid 1.5 percent to 3,520 yen in Tokyo.  Nissan Motor Co., which has factories in Mexico, fell 2.9
percent to 865 yen after the country experienced its biggest
earthquake since 2003 overnight. Mexican President Felipe
Calderon, in a message posted on Twitter, said no major damage
had been detected and there were no reports of casualties.  Raw-material producers posted the second-biggest decline
among the 10 industry groups in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. The
 London Metal Exchange Index (LMEX)  of prices for six industrial
commodities including copper and aluminum fell 1.5 percent
yesterday.  BHP dropped 1.7 percent to A$34.70. Rio Tinto Group, the
world’s third-biggest mining company by market value, slid 0.4
percent to A$65.34.  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , a Japanese commodities
trader that gets about 43 percent of sales from metals and
energy, declined 2 percent to 1,986 yen in Tokyo.  Australia, the largest shipper of iron ore and coal, cut

year by 3.2 percent amid expectations of lower commodity prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
