Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503)  and
 Toshiba Corp. (6502)  face new European Union antitrust fines over a
cartel after earlier penalties were overturned in court.  “The decision will be readopted for the two companies for
which the general court annulled the fine,” Antoine Colombani,
a spokesman for the European Commission, said in an e-mail.  The  EU General Court  last year ruled the European
Commission, the 27-nation EU’s antitrust regulator, had fined
the two Asian companies more harshly than European competitors
for an electrical-equipment cartel.  The EU fined 10 companies, including  Areva SA (CEI)  and  Alstom
SA (ALO) , a total of 750.7 million euros ($994.5 million) in January
2007 for fixing prices and carving up the market for gas-
insulated switchgear, used to control electrical flow from 1988
to 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
