Serbia ’s central bank sold 20
million euros ($26.38 million) to slow the dinar’s decline
today, after the currency dropped almost 0.5 percent on the day.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije said it was acting
against the dinar volatility, not its trend, according to a
statement posted on its website. It began selling euros after
the dinar dropped to as low as 111.3731 to the common currency.
It set the dinar rate for tomorrow at 111.0888 to the euro.  The dinar extended declines on a day when the central
bank’s outstanding repo stock shrank by an additional 4 billion
dinars to a four-month low of 97.659 billion dinars. The
outstanding repo stock fell by 32 billion dinars on March 14
when the bank sold 40 million euros to slow dinar declines.  The National Bank of Serbia has spent 325.5 million euros
since the start of 2012 to prop up the dinar, the 10th worst-
performing currency of 175 tracked by Bloomberg, with a year-on-
year drop of 7.32 percent against the euro, half of it since the
start of 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
