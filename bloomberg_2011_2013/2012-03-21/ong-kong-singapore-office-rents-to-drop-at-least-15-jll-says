Hong Kong  and Singapore commercial
property rents and prices will drop by more than 15 percent in
2012 as financial services companies keep a lid on growth or
shrink, according to  Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL)   Hong Kong rents will drop by 15 percent this year and
prices by 16 percent, while Singapore rents will fall 11 percent
and values 20 percent, Alastair Hughes, Asia-Pacific chief
executive officer of the world’s second-biggest publicly traded
commercial-property broker, said at a presentation in Sydney.  Global firms have become more mindful of costs amid
 Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis, with companies including Royal
Bank of Scotland Plc, Macquarie Group Ltd. and Daiwa Securities
Group Inc. among the latest to announce job cuts in the Asia-
Pacific region.  Office rental growth slowed to 0.9 percent across the
region in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from 2.5 percent in the
previous three months, as rising supply in China and  India 
pushed vacancies higher, Jones Lang LaSalle said last month.  New Delhi will see a 28 percent rise in supply, followed by
Shanghai which will add 25 percent more space this year, Hughes
said today.  Rents and prices in Beijing and Jakarta will be underpinned
by strong economic and revenue growth, he said.  “We’ve had a synchronized downturn, but a variable
recovery,” Hughes said. “Some values are growing, like in
China and Indonesia, some are flat, like in  Tokyo  and Seoul,
some are falling, like in Hong Kong and Singapore.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
