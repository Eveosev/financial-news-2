Turkey  plans to cut tax on
relatively energy-efficient cars, while taxing older and less
efficient ones more heavily, Vatan  reported , citing Energy
Minister  Taner Yildiz .  The new regime is likely to be introduced within two years,
the Istanbul-based newspaper said, adding that tax on diesel
vehicles will also be increased.  The measures should help to remove older vehicles from the
road by offering people an incentive to buy new models, whereas
the current system favors older ones by taxing them more
lightly, Vatan said, citing Energy Ministry officials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
