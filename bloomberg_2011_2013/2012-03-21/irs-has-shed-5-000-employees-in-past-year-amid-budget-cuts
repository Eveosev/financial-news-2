The  Internal Revenue Service  has
5,000 fewer employees this tax filing season compared with 2011.  The IRS accelerated workers’ retirements through attrition
and incentives, IRS Commissioner  Douglas Shulman  told a U.S.
House committee today. About 3,000 of the employees worked in
tax enforcement, he said. In fiscal year 2010, the agency’s
workforce averaged 94,711 people.  Shulman said he worries that federal budget cuts could
start to erode tax enforcement and voluntary compliance.  “People start wondering: Am I really going to get
caught?” he said, noting that only about 1 percent of tax
returns are audited. “There’s some people who will play the
audit lottery.”  The IRS is seeking $12.8 billion for its budget for the
fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. That’s an 8 percent increase
from this year’s budget.  Representative Jo Ann Emerson, chairwoman of the
subcommittee that oversees IRS funding, said she has tried to
keep the agency from experiencing more severe cuts. Emerson, a
Missouri Republican, said federal budget pressure may make that
goal difficult to achieve.  Representative Jose Serrano of  New York , the top Democrat
on the subcommittee, said the government should restore funding
to the agency.  “When you cut IRS for short-term political gain, you do
long-term damage,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
