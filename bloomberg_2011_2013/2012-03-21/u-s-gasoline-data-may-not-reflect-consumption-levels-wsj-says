U.S. government statistics
overstated the decline in the nation’s  gasoline demand  in the
past year, according to the  Wall Street Journal .  The Energy Information Administration uses export and
production figures to calculate demand figures and last year
underestimated the volume of fuel shipped overseas, the
newspaper reported, citing Robert Merriam, who oversees the
weekly Petroleum Status Report.  The 7 percent drop in demand from a year ago is “closer to
4 percent,” Merriam is cited as saying in the report dated
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
