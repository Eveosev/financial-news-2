Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said that the U.K. needs to find a solution to the lack
of airport capacity in the southeast of the country to maintain
its links with emerging economies.  London’s Heathrow airport,  Europe ’s busiest airport,
currently operates at 99 percent capacity. Prime Minister  David Cameron  scrapped plans for a third runway in May 2010 in favor
of developing a high-speed rail link from London to northern
 England  to reduce demand for short-haul flights.  “We cannot cut ourselves off from the fastest growing
cities in the world,” Osborne said to lawmakers in London as he
presented his annual budget. The Transport Secretary will set
out the government’s thoughts on the issue “later this
summer,” he said.  Osborne also said that the government was seeking
investment from U.K. pension funds in infrastructure. The
government is seeking funds to develop roads, railways, clean
energy and water, as well as broadband networks he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
