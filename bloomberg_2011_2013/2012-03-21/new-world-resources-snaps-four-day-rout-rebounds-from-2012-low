New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the Czech
Republic’s biggest producer of coking coal, increased after
tumbling to a three-month low in the previous four days.  The stock rallied as much as 2.9 percent before paring the
gain to 1.5 percent at 131.2 koruna as of 10:18 p.m. in Prague,
making it the second-best performer in the 14-member  PX (PX)  index.
The rebound reduced this month’s declines to 17 percent.  NWR slid 10 percent in the previous four sessions, pushing
the stock’s 14-day relative strength index to 26.4 yesterday.
Readings lower than 30 suggest to some technical analysts that a
security or index may rise. The RSI last traded at 30.5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
