German two-year note yields were
two basis points from a three-month high before the nation sells
as much as 5 billion euros ($6.6 billion) of the securities.  Ten-year bonds slipped after Greek Prime Minister  Lucas
Papademos  won parliamentary approval for a new 130 billion-euro
international bailout. Portugal is scheduled to auction as much
as 2 billion euros of treasury bills maturing in 119 and 364
days, having added one-year bills to the program due to demand
from investors.  Germany  will also sell 2 billion euros of
inflation-linked bonds due in April 2023.  The German two-year yield rose less than one basis point to
0.34 percent at 7:26 a.m. London time. Yields reached 0.36
percent on March 16, the highest since Dec. 7. The 0.25 percent
security due March 2014, was at 99.83 cents on the euro. The 10-
year yield rose one basis point to 2.05 percent.  German bonds made a 1.1 percent loss this year after
returning 9.7 percent in 2011, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Portuguese debt has climbed 5.7 percent since Dec.
31, the data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
