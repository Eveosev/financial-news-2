Alex Smith  signed a three-year
contract to stay with the  San Francisco 49ers  after the club was
rejected in their attempt to acquire quarterback  Peyton Manning .  Smith, 27, who led the 49ers to a 13-3 record and the
National Football Conference championship game last season, met
with the Miami Dolphins after the 49ers held a workout for
Manning -- who signed yesterday with the Denver Broncos.  Smith said in a conference call today that he was “not
offended at all” by the 49ers’ pursuit of Manning, a four-time
National Football League Most Valuable Player.  “I would have relished the opportunity to compete for the
starting quarterback job with Peyton Manning,” Smith told
reporters. “This was the plan all along, where I wanted to be.
This was the goal, to get back here and get it done.”  The 49ers said in an e-mailed release that Smith, who was a
free agent, had signed a deal through the 2014 season. Terms
weren’t disclosed.  Smith, the No. 1 pick in the 2005 draft, last season
completed 273 passes for 3,144 yards, both career highs, and 17
touchdowns as the 49ers reached the playoffs for the first time
since the 2002 season. He threw five interceptions.  The 49ers lost 20-17 to the  New York Giants  in overtime in
the NFC championship game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
