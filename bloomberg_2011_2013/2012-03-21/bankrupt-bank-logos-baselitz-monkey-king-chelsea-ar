Danish art collective  Superflex 
examines the recent financial crisis with a hanging installation
featuring bank logos.  The “Bankrupt Banks” exhibition at Peter Blum gallery in
Chelsea has 24 cheerful painted banners, 6.6-feet square,
hanging back to back from the ceiling in rows of two and three.  Merrill Lynch’s bull is shown in black on white, while
 Fannie Mae  has its blue-and-white house on a hill and Washington
Mutual’s punctured blue “W” is set against a yellow
background.  A handout list details what happened to each company:
“Alliance & Leicester acquired by Grupo Santander, July 14,
2008,” or “First Federal Bank of California acquired by One
 West Bank , December 19, 2009.”  The banners are $18,000 each. The show runs through April
14 at 526 W. 29th St. Information: +1-212-244-6055;

punch in his new giant paintings and sculpture at Gagosian
gallery.  These “remixes” of works from the 1960s are mostly either
10-by-13-feet or 13-by-10-feet. The artist paints them on the
floor, crawling around and leaving a lot to chance.  The vertical canvases depict solitary figures of uncertain
gender, split in two parts. Heads and shoulders occupy the upper
areas, often on black background. The lower regions are almost
abstract, with hands being the only identifiable body parts.  Spidery black lines drip over muscular patches of ochre,
orange and pastel pink and blue, with unsettling effect.  A bronze sculpture shows an 11-foot man and a 10-foot
woman, their arms linked and bodies chopped and charred -- a
hulking, haunting presence.  The large paintings are $750,000. The show runs through
April 7 at 522 W. 21st St. Information: +1-212-741-1717;

traditional paper-cutting techniques to a new level in his
exhibition “Seven Layered Shell” at  Chambers Fine Art .  The most striking are three transparent silk banners. Each
is about 12 feet by 11 feet, dramatically lit and decorated with
tiny figures carved with manic precision from ox-hides.  The banners star a central image (nine-headed serpent,
monkey king) while sharing the same overall cast of 185
characters. Some of the figures are historical, including
Darwin, Freud and Mao; others phantasmagoric. The ox-hide glows
like gold on one side and resembles shadow puppets on another.  Prices range from $5,000 for works on paper to $160,000 for
a sculpture; the silk banners are $65,000. The show runs through
April 21 at 522 W. 19th St. Information: +1-212-414-1169;
