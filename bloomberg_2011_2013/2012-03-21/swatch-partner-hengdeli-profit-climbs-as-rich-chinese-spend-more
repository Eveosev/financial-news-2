Hengdeli Holdings Ltd. (3389) , the retail
partner of Swatch Group AG in  China , posted a 47 percent jump in
2011 profit as increasingly affluent Chinese spent more on
luxury and fashionable watches.  Net income increased to 815 million yuan ($129 million) in
the year ended Dec. 31, beating the 762 million yuan average of
eight analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Hengdeli, a distributor of the Omega and Rolex brands, is
expanding by adding stores to grow in China’s luxury market
estimated by Bain & Co. at 212 billion yuan last year. The
rising number of millionaires in China is boosting demand for
 luxury goods  in the country. Wealthy Chinese consumers own about
four high-end watches on average, according to the Hurun Wealth
Report.  Hengdeli, whose  shareholders  include Swatch and LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, has 405 stores, an increase of 55
outlets, it said in a statement to the  Hong Kong  Stock Exchange
yesterday. Sales climbed 38 percent to 11.4 billion yuan in
2011, according to the statement.  Shares of Hengdeli dropped 3.8 percent to HK$3.32 in Hong
Kong. They have jumped 31 percent this year, outperforming the
benchmark Hang Seng Index’s 13 percent gain.  Consumers in  Asia  bought more than half of the Swiss
timepieces sold abroad last year, while China became the third-
biggest destination for watch exports. Shipments to Hong Kong,
the biggest market, jumped 28 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
