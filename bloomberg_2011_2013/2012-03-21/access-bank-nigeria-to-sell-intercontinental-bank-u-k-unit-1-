Access Bank Plc (ACCESS) ,  Nigeria ’s sixth-
largest lender by market value, plans to sell its entire stake
in Intercontinental Bank U.K., Chief Executive Officer Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede said.  “The bank has commenced discussions with two potential
buyers and will ensure that the transaction is concluded soon
and at no loss to us,” Aig-Imoukhuede said today on a
conference call from Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital.  Access last year acquired  Intercontinental Bank Plc (INTERCON) , one of
eight lenders bailed out by the central bank in 2009 after a
debt crisis caused in part by loans to speculators in equities.
Five of them, including Intercontinental, were taken over by
investors and three were nationalized.  “The units of both banks in  Ghana  will merge by mid-
year,” Aig-Imokhuede said.  Access Bank’s net income in the year through to December
jumped 51 percent to 16.7 billion naira ($106 million), the bank
said March 16. Revenue advanced to 138.9 billion naira, up from
91.1 billion naira a year earlier.  The bank’s  shares  fell 3.8 percent to 6.20 naira by the
close in Lagos, the lowest since Feb. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
