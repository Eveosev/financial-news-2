Hartford Financial (HIG)  Services Group
Inc. Chief Executive Officer  Liam McGee , who is seeking buyers
for parts of the insurer’s business, said he opted against the
complete breakup advocated by billionaire John Paulson because
it wasn’t the best way to create value.  “That was a part of our evaluation,” McGee said today in
an interview. “I discussed it transparently at our fourth-
quarter  earnings  call and followed up with another comment,
saying that while we appreciate the potential benefits of a
split, we just didn’t think it made sense for shareholders of
The Hartford at this time.”  Paulson runs Paulson & Co., a hedge fund that owns more
than  8 percent  of the Hartford, Connecticut-based insurer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
