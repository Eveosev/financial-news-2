Coffee exports from  Vietnam , the
world’s largest shipper of robusta beans, may slow in 2012
compared with estimates for 2011, according to an agriculture
ministry report published today.  Shipments may total about 1.1 million metric tons this
year, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development forecast
in today’s report. The Ministry said Dec. 27 that exports for
2011 may reach 1.22 million tons, an increase of 0.2 percent
compared to 2010. The ministry didn’t provide an explanation for
the 2012 estimate.  A rise in domestic coffee consumption to 10 percent of
Vietnam’s output from 5 percent may reduce export volumes in the
2011-2012 crop year that began Oct. 1,  Luong Van Tu , chairman of
the  Vietnam Coffee & Cocoa Association  said in Ho Chi Minh City
Dec. 8. Vietnam will harvest 21.25 million bags of coffee this
season, 9 percent more than a year earlier, according to a
Bloomberg survey of 10 traders, growers and exporters. Each bag
weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  Exports of rice from Vietnam, the world’s second-largest
shipper of the crop, will be 6.85 million tons to 7.35 million
tons in 2012, according to today’s report. The Ministry said
Dec. 27 that the Southeast Asian nation may ship 7.19 million
tons in the whole of 2011, an increase of 4.4 percent compared
to a year earlier.  Rubber shipments by the world’s fourth-biggest rubber
exporter may total 883,856 tons this year, the ministry said.
That compares with the 846,000 tons estimated on Dec. 27 for
2011.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
