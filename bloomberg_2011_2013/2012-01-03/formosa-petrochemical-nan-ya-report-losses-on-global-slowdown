Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (6505)  and Nan
Ya Plastics Corp., units of  Formosa Plastics Group , reported
fourth-quarter losses, missing estimates, as a slowing global
economy cut demand.  Oil refiner Formosa Petrochemical posted a pretax loss of
NT$4.39 billion ($145 million) for the three months ended Dec.
31, its parent said in a statement today. The average of four
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg was for a NT$8.93
billion pretax profit. Plastics processor Nan Ya reported a loss
of NT$1.57 billion on a pretax basis, compared with the NT$8.87
billion pretax profit that analysts expected.  Group Chairman William Wong said last month he is downbeat
on the first-half outlook for the oil and petrochemical industry
because of the European debt crisis and the  U.S. economy . Nomura
Holdings Inc. estimates China’s gross domestic product will grow
7.9 percent in 2012, the slowest pace in 13 years. The mainland
is Taiwan’s biggest overseas market.  “Customers cut factory utilization and stockpiles,” Danny Ho, a Taipei-based analyst at Yuanta Securities Co., said before
the earnings announcement. “Clients lack confidence because of
the uncertain industry outlook.”  Ho has a “hold” rating on Formosa Petrochemical and a
“buy” recommendation for  Nan Ya. (1303)   Chemical producer  Formosa Chemicals & Fibre Corp. (1326)  posted a
pretax loss of NT$2.21 billion. The average of four analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg was for a pretax profit of
NT$9.18 billion.  Polyvinyl chloride maker  Formosa Plastics Corp. (1301)  posted a
pretax profit of NT$942 million in the fourth quarter, less than
the NT$9.12 billion average of three analyst estimates compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on the story:
