Chile’s government has proposed
promoting the central bank’s research director Luis Oscar Herrera to the bank’s board,  La Segunda  reported, citing
Christian Democrat Senator Hosain Sabag.  Christian Democrats  in the Senate, which must approve the
government’s nominee to the board, wouldn’t support Herrera and
instead want a member of their party to become a policy maker,
the Santiago-based newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
