The University of Oregon defeated the
University of Wisconsin 45-38 to end a 93-year wait for a second
victory in college football’s  Rose Bowl .  The Ducks had lost in each of their four appearances in the
Rose Bowl since beating Pennsylvania 14-0 in the third edition
in 1917. Their last defeat in the game in Pasadena,  California ,
came against Ohio State two years ago, while they also lost last
year’s national championship game to Auburn University.  Wisconsin has now lost two straight years in the Rose Bowl.
The Badgers won the Rose Bowl in 1994, 1999 and 2000.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
