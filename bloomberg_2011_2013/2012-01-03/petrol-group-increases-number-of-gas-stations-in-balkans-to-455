Petrol Group d.d. (PETG) , Slovenia’s biggest
energy company, opened six new motor-fuel stations in the
Balkans as it strengthens its foothold in the region.  “We have opened one unit in  Kosovo , one in  Serbia  and one
in Croatia along with three new retail units in Montenegro in
December,” Aleksander Salkic, spokesman for the Ljubljana-based
company, said in a phone interview today. “That brings the
total in the region to 455.”  The Slovenian company also plans to offer other sources of
energy at its retail network like gas, Salkic said.  Petrol, Slovenia’s biggest public company by revenue last
year, has been expanding its retail network in the Balkans as
the region moves closer to the European Union to benefit from
expanded business and trade. In December, the company sold 33
million euros ($43 million) of corporate bonds to finance
investment and adjust its debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
