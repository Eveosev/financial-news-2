The number of cars and light trucks
sold globally will grow 6.7 percent this year, led by Chinese
demand outside the population centers of Shanghai and Beijing,
R.L. Polk & Co. said.  Sales will rise to 77.7 million vehicles, helped by a 16
percent gain in  China  to 17.9 million, according to  Polk , a
research company based in Southfield,  Michigan . China sales were
unchanged at 15.5 million in 2011, Polk estimated, after the
government phased out purchase incentives.  “Growth in China will pick up again in 2012,” Anthony
Pratt, Polk’s director of forecasting for the Americas, said in
a telephone interview. “The growth there will be more a
function of natural demand than stimulus, and the expansion in
the second-and third-tier cities is a trend that’s going to
continue to develop.”  Sales in Europe will be unchanged at about 19 million
vehicles, as austerity measures and sovereign-debt concerns
prevent governments from offering scrappage programs and other
incentives for purchasers, Polk said. Sales in  Europe  were about
19.2 million last year, after reaching 18.5 million in 2010,
Polk estimated.  In the U.S., sales of cars and light trucks will rise 7.3
percent to 13.7 million, Polk said. The U.S. won’t surpass its
pre-recession sales level of 16 million vehicles until 2015,
Polk said. Luxury cars will remain the fastest-growing part of
the U.S. market, with more than 14 percent growth, according to
the forecast. Sales topped 12.7 million in 2011, Polk estimated,
after totaling 11.5 million in 2010.  Heightened Competition  While Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp. will increase
sales volumes in 2012, their brands won’t gain market share,
according to Polk. That’s because they face heightened
competition, including efforts by  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and Honda
Motor Co. to win back market share lost to production cuts after
the March earthquake and tsunami in Japan, Polk said.  “The inventory issues were settled and now, more than
ever, there’s more and stronger competition out there,” Pratt
said. “The domestics now are in a better position to compete on
product than they’ve ever been.”  Growth in the BRIC countries --  Brazil ,  India , Russia and
China -- should outpace that of most mature markets “over the
next few years,” Polk said.  The researcher said it expects forthcoming data to show
that sales in Brazil exceeded those in  Germany  in 2011. India
will surpass Germany by 2014, Polk said. Sales in  Russia , while
likely to be unchanged in 2012, will be larger than Germany’s by
2015, Polk said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
