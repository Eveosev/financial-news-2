Taiwan’s President Ma Ying-jeou
maintained a lead over rival Tsai Ing-wen in the last opinion
polls permitted before presidential and legislative elections.  Ma, the candidate of the ruling Kuomintang, would receive
44 percent of the vote while the  Democratic Progressive Party ’s
Tsai would win 36 percent, according to a survey by United Daily
News published today. That compared with 41 percent versus 33
percent in a Dec. 17 poll. The latest survey of 2,011 people had
a 2.2 percent margin of error and was conducted from Dec. 28 to
Jan. 2. Support for James Soong, chairman of the People First
Party, fell to 7 percent from 10 percent.  Publishing opinion poll results is banned during the 10
days leading up to an election, according to the Central
Election Commission. Exit poll results can’t be published until
voting stations close at 4 p.m. on Jan. 14. Violators will be
fined between NT$500,000 ($16,500) and NT$5 million, the
commission said in a statement.  Ma, 61, who returned the Kuomintang party to power in 2008
after the opposition DPP had held the presidency for eight
years, says Taiwan will reap economic benefits from the
agreements signed with  China (CHFAYOY)  since he took office. Tsai, 55, who
has pledged to create more jobs, narrow a widening wealth gap
and curb high property prices, says Ma’s government is too
reliant on  China  and that the DPP wants to develop other
international markets.  China Reliance  Two other polls also gave victory to Ma. A survey by the
China Times newspaper showed support for the president at 39.5
percent versus 36.5 percent for Tsai. The poll of 1,104 people,
conducted on Jan. 2, had a margin of error of 3 percent.  Ma would win 45 percent to Tsai’s 37 percent, TVBS Poll
Center said today. The survey of 1,111 people had a 2.9 percent
margin of error and was conducted from Dec. 30 to Jan. 2.  Tsai leads Ma by 1 percent, or about 100,000 to 150,000
votes, according to a DPP survey of about 70,000 respondents
carried out from mid-November to the end of December, the party
said in an e-mailed statement today.  In the 2008 presidential election, Ma beat the DPP 58
percent to 42 percent by pledging to abandon a pro-independence
stance in favor of strengthening economic relations with China.  A win by the pro-independence opposition led by Tsai may
strain cross-strait relations. China regards  Taiwan , ruled
separately since a civil war ended in 1949, as its own territory
and was enraged when the DPP’s Chen Shui-bian pushed for
recognition as a sovereign nation during his presidency.  Slowing Economy  If re-elected, Ma would retain control of a Taiwan economy
that grew at the slowest pace in two years in the third quarter
as the global recovery weakened. The government cut its 2011
gross domestic product forecast to 4.56 percent from 4.81
percent as exports declined.  Ma, who heads the KMT party that fought China’s communists
six decades ago, reversed the DPP’s pro-independence stance when
he took office in May 2008. Taiwan has since signed 16
agreements with the mainland, including a trade pact, and lifted
a six-decade ban on direct air, sea and postal links. The
rapprochement helped economic growth rebound to 13.6 percent in
the first quarter of 2010, the fastest pace in more than 30
years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
