Ronald Searle, the British 
cartoonist who created the original St. Trinians schoolgirls,
died at the age of 91 at a hospital near his home in  France ,
the British Broadcasting Corp. said, citing his daughter Kate.  Searle, a former prisoner of war of the Japanese in World
War II, drew a series of sketches portraying the conditions of
his imprisonment.  The first St. Trinian’s film, featuring the activities of
an anarchical group of schoolgirls, was made in 1954; in 2007
the series was revived, with Rupert Everett in the role of the
headmistress.  Searle, who was captured in  Singapore  in 1942, was held
first in Changi Prison and then worked on the Siam-Burma “Death
Railway” in the Kwai jungles. He concealed his sketches of the
brutal conditions under mattresses of fellow prisoners who were
dying of cholera, and they were published on his release after
1945.  He was awarded the CBE by the British, the Legion d’Honneur
by France, and invested with the German Order of Merit in 2009.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
