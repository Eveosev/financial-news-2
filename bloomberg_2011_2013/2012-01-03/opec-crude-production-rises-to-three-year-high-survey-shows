Crude production by the  Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries  rose to the highest level in
three years in December, led by surging Libyan output, a
Bloomberg News survey showed.  Production (OPCRTOTL)  increased 162,000 barrels, or 0.5 percent, to an
average 30.667 million barrels a day from a revised 30.505
million, the most since November 2008, according to the survey
of  oil companies , producers and analysts. Daily output by the 11
members with quotas, all except  Iraq , climbed 167,000 barrels to
27.967 million, 3.122 million barrels above their former target.  OPEC decided at a Dec. 14 meeting in Vienna to increase its
production ceiling to 30 million barrels a day, the first change
in three years. The new target is for all members of the group,
including Iraq. The organization will be reviewing the quotas at
its next meeting scheduled for June 14.  Libyan output (OPCRLIBY)  rose 100,000 barrels to 700,000 a day last
month, the highest level since February, the survey showed.
Production in the country had tumbled from 1.585 million barrels
a day in January, the last month before an uprising against the
government of  Muammar Qaddafi  disrupted output.  Saudi Arabia (OPCRSAUD) , OPECâ€™s biggest producer, increased output by
50,000 barrels to 9.65 million barrels a day in December.
November production was revised 50,000 barrels a day higher.  To contact the reporters on this story:
