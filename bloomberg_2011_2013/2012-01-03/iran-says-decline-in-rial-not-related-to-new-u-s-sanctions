Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
 Ramin Mehmanparast  said the decline in the value of Iran’s rial
against the dollar has nothing to do with the new sanctions
instituted by the U.S. on Iran’s central bank.  The sanctions have yet to be implemented and Iran does not
have banking transactions with the U.S. or Britain, Mehmanparast
said in Tehran today, according to state TV’s news website.  U.S. President  Barack Obama  on Dec. 31 signed into law
measures that deny access to the U.S. financial system to any
foreign bank that conducts business with the Central Bank of
Iran.  To contact the reporter on this story:
