Romania ’s corn harvest rose 26
percent in 2011, producing the biggest crop in seven years,
according to a document published on the  Agriculture Ministry ’s
website.  Farmers reaped 11.4 million metric tons of the grain from
6.2 million acres, the ministry said. The crop was the biggest
since the 14.6 million tons gathered in 2004, the figures show.  “Romania has the potential to export about 10 million tons
of corn and wheat, following the very good crop,” Agriculture
Minister Valeriu Tabara said in a phone interview today. “The
country has already exported about 2 million tons of grains so
far.”  The Romanian farmers are seeking to take advantage of
higher international grain prices and boost exports as they need
money to invest in outdated machines, technology and buy
fertilizers.  Romania’s wheat harvest increased 24 percent last year to
about 7.2 million metric tons, the biggest crop in six years,
the ministry’s data show.  South Africa  already said today it’s importing yellow corn
from Romania with two ships en-route to the Western Cape
province, Reuters reported, citing Jannie de Villiers, the chief
executive officer of Grain SA, a farmers’ group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
