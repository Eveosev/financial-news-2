Stocks (MXWD)  surged, driving the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  to the highest level since July, and
commodities rallied on signs of increasing manufacturing output
around the world. The dollar weakened and U.S. Treasuries fell.  The Dow increased 179.82 points, or 1.5 percent, to
12,397.38 and the S&P 500 jumped 1.6 percent to 1,277.06, the
highest close since Oct. 28, at 4 p.m. in New York. The  Stoxx
Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  added 1.6 percent and closed at a five-month
high. The dollar slipped versus all 16 major peers, while 10-
year Treasury yields increased seven basis points to 1.95
percent. Oil settled at an almost eight-month high near $103 a
barrel as 23 of 24 commodities in the S&P GSCI Index rose.  Financial, industrial and commodity shares led the  S&P
500 ’s gain as the Institute for Supply Management’s factory
index expanded at the fastest pace in six months and government
data showed construction spending grew at more than twice the
forecast rate. Factory  output (AIGPMI)  in  Australia  grew for the first
time in six months and reports in the past two days showed a
pickup in Chinese and Indian manufacturing.  “You’re starting to see people want to take more risks,”
 Frank Ingarra , who helps manage the Can Slim Select Growth Fund
at Greenwich, Connecticut-based NorthCoast Asset Management LLC,
said in a telephone interview. His firm oversees $1.4 billion.
“Manufacturing data has been pretty decent.”  New Year Rally  All 10 of the  main industry groups  (SPXL1) in the S&P 500 advanced
today except for utilities, which climbed 15 percent last year
for the biggest gain. Financials, the worst-performing group in
2011 with an 18 percent drop, climbed 2.8 percent as a group
today to help lead gains. Alcoa Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank
of America Corp., Chevron Corp. and Caterpillar Inc. rallied at
least 3.7 percent as the Dow extend its 5.5 percent 2011
advance.  The ISM’s manufacturing index rose to 53.9 in December from
52.7 a month before, above the reading of 50 that signals growth
and topping the 53.5 median projection of economists in a
survey. Construction spending climbed 1.2 percent in November,
Commerce Department data showed.  Forecasters at securities firms are more conservative on
U.S.  stocks (MXWD)  than any time in seven years, predicting the S&P 500
will rise 6.4 percent to 1,338 in 2012 as budget deficits around
the world limit gains. That’s the smallest predicted return
since 2005. Adam Parker of Morgan Stanley, whose estimate for
2011 proved the most accurate among current analysts, forecast a
loss of 7.2 percent as  Europe ’s debt crisis will keep volatility
above historical levels.  Federal Reserve officials will for the first time make
public their own forecasts for the  federal funds rate (FDTR)  at their
Jan. 24-25 meeting, minutes from the December 13 Federal Open
Market Committee said today. FOMC “participants decided to
incorporate information about their projections of appropriate
monetary policy” into their Summary of Economic Projections
starting with their next meeting, the minutes said.  European Shares  The  Stoxx 600 (SPX)  climbed to the highest level since August as
the U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index and the Swiss Market Index, both of
which were closed yesterday for a holiday, climbed more than 1.9
percent to lead gains in the region.  Rio Tinto Group led a rally in mining companies, gaining
6.4 percent. Afren Plc jumped 20 percent as the U.K. energy
explorer focused on  Africa  said production topped its forecasts.  The  MSCI All-Country World Index (MXWD)  sank 9.4 percent last
year, the most since 2008, as Europe’s debt crisis hurt global
growth. The S&P 500 Index closed the year almost unchanged,
slipping less than 0.1 percent, to beat benchmark indexes in all
24 developed markets except for Ireland, where the ISEQ Overall
Index increased 0.6 percent.  Default Swaps Drop  A benchmark gauge of U.S. company credit risk dropped to
the lowest level in two months. The Markit CDX North America
Investment Grade Index of credit-default swaps, which investors
use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, decreased 2.2 basis points to a mid-price of
118.09 basis points. The index fell as low as 117.6, the least
since Oct. 31. Contracts on Bank of America Corp. and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. also fell.  The dollar weakened 0.9 percent today to $1.3051 per euro,
which appreciated 0.6 percent against the yen after falling to
an 11-year low yesterday. The yen weakened against 13 of its 16
most-traded peers monitored by Bloomberg, while the New Zealand
dollar strengthened versus all but two of its major
counterparts.  Moves by the Fed to flood the world with dollars are doing
little to dent the currency’s value, bolstering the appeal of
U.S. assets at a time when the government needs the support of
foreign investors the most.  Dollar’s Share  The U.S.  Dollar Index (DXY)  appreciated 13 percent from a record
low in March 2008 through the end of 2011 even as the Fed kept
 interest rates  at about zero and printed cash to buy $2.3
trillion of Treasury and mortgage-related bonds, and is little
changed since 1991. The  International Monetary Fund  said Dec. 30
that the dollar’s share of global foreign-exchange reserves rose
in the third quarter by the most since 2008.  The 30-year Treasury yield rose eight basis points to 2.98
percent today as improving economic data damped demand for the
relative safety of U.S. government debt.  Governments of the world’s leading economies have more than
$7.6 trillion of debt maturing this year, with most facing a
rise in borrowing costs. Led by  Japan ’s $3 trillion and the
U.S.’s $2.8 trillion, the amount coming due for the Group of
Seven nations and Brazil,  Russia ,  India  and  China  is up from
$7.4 trillion at this time last year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Ten-year bond yields will be higher by year-end
for at least seven of the countries, forecasts show.  European Bonds  The German 10-year bund yield slipped less than one basis
point to 1.899 percent. Italian 10-year bond yields were little
changed at at 6.92. Austrian bonds slid, driving the  difference
in yield (.AUSTGER)  with bunds nine basis points higher to 123 basis
points. The French-German spread widened six basis points to 139
as  France  auctioned debt.  German unemployment fell more than forecast in December as
exports of cars and machinery boomed and one of the mildest
winters on record helped support jobs in construction. The
number of people out of work fell by a seasonally adjusted
22,000 to 2.89 million and the adjusted jobless rate dropped to
6.8 percent.  Bank funding costs declined with the three-month cross-
currency basis swap, the rate lenders pay to convert euro
interest payments into dollars, slipping 10.5 basis points to
103.5 basis points below the euro interbank offered rate. That’s
the lowest cost for dollar funding since Nov. 8, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Oil Surges  Oil in  New York  jumped 4.2 percent to $102.96 a barrel, the
highest settlement since May 11, as Iran’s Deputy Navy Commander
Rear Admiral Mahmoud Mousavi told Press TV that any effort to
harm the nation’s interests will lead to “reciprocal
measures.” Copper advanced 2.7 percent to $3.5285 a pound in
New York, a three-week high. All 24 commodities tracked by the
S&P GSCI Index advanced except for Kansas wheat, sending the
gauge up 3.4 percent for its biggest advance on a closing basis
since May.  Speculators increased wagers on rising commodity prices by
the most since August 2010 on signs that sustained economic
growth will drive a rebound in raw materials from their first
annual slump since the recession. Hedge funds and other money
managers increased combined net-long positions across 18 U.S.
futures and options by 18 percent to 536,907 contracts in the
week ended Dec. 27, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data
show.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  rose 2.6 percent, the
biggest advance in a month. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index (HSCEI)  jumped 3 percent as trading resumed in  Hong Kong .
Benchmark indexes gained more than 2.4 percent in Brazil,
Argentina, Russia, India and South Korea.  To contact the reporters on this story:
