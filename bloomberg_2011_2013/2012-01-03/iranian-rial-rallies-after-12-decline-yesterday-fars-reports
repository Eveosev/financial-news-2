Iran’s rial rallied after a 12
percent drop yesterday, trading at 15,850 to the  U.S. dollar  in
street markets late today after reaching 17,800 yesterday, the
state-run  Fars news agency  reported.  The decline in the value of the rial has nothing to do with
the new sanctions instituted by the U.S. on Iran’s central bank,
Governor Mahmoud Bahmani said, according to a separate Fars
report.  U.S. President  Barack Obama  on Dec. 31 signed into law
measures that deny access to the U.S. financial system to any
foreign bank that conducts business with the Central Bank of
Iran.  To contact the reporter on this story:
