Jerry Angelo was fired as general
manager of the  Chicago Bears  after the team lost five of its
final six games.  Angelo was informed of the decision today by team president
Ted Phillips, the Bears said in an e-mailed statement.  The Bears finished 8-8, and missed the playoffs for the
fourth time in five years. The club lost five consecutive games
in the second half of the season following quarterback  Jay Cutler ’s season-ending thumb injury, then won its Jan. 1 season
finale against the  Minnesota Vikings .  Eight-year head coach Lovie Smith said yesterday on the
franchise’s website that the Bears did not need a major overhaul
to be competitive in 2012.  “If you’re watching football and you’ve seen us, I think
you’ll say that when we were 7-3, that’s a pretty good football
team,” Smith said. “If we keep the core in place and just make
the changes that you normally make after a season, we get back
there.”  Angelo was hired by the Bears in 2001. In his 11 years with
the team,  Chicago  won four division titles and had a Super Bowl
appearance.  -- Editor: Michael Sillup, Jay Beberman  To contact the reporter on this story:
