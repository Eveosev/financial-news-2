About 53 percent of the winter wheat
in  Kansas , the biggest producer, was rated good-to-excellent as
of Jan. 1, up from 47 percent a month  earlier , after receiving
much-needed precipitation, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said today.  About 63 percent of Oklahomaâ€™s crop received the top
ratings as of Dec. 31, compared with 56 percent in late
November, according to the USDA. The crop in Texas was rated 25
percent good-to-excellent, unchanged from the end of  November .  To contact the reporter on this story:
