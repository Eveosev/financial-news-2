Premiums for U.S. Gulf Coast oils
strengthened as the gap between West Texas Intermediate and
Brent widened for the fourth consecutive session.  The  spread (CLCO1)  between the two benchmark crudes widened 62
cents to $9.17 a barrel at 2:45 p.m. today in  New York . When
Brent increases versus WTI, it strengthens the value of low-
sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet (USCSLLSS) ’s premium to WTI gained 40 cents to
$9.55 a barrel at 2:08 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet (USCSHLSE)  was unchanged at
$10 over the U.S. benchmark.  Thunder Horse’s premium increased 30 cents to $6.65. Mars
Blend rose 35 cents to $5.85 over WTI.  Poseidon (USCSPOSE) ’s premium was
unchanged at $5.  Southern Green Canyon (USCSSGCN)  gained 25 cents to $4.40 over WTI.
 West Texas Sour (USCSWTSM) ’s discount was unchanged at $1.35 a barrel.  The discount for  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS)  widened 10 cents to
$16.25 a barrel.  Syncrude (USCSSYNS) ’s premium narrowed 75 cents to $2.30 a barrel
above WTI. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived
from the  tar sands  in  Alberta .  To contact the reporter on this story:
