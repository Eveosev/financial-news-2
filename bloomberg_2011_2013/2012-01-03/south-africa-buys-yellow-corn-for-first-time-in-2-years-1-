South Africa  is importing two cargoes
of yellow corn from Romania, its first imports of the grain in
two years, said Jannie de Villiers, chief executive officer of
Grain SA, a farmersâ€™ group.  Shipments are normally about 30,000 metric tons per vessel
and the ports where the corn will be delivered are in Western
Cape Province, he said.  Cape Town  is the main port in the
province.  South African stocks of yellow corn, which is mainly used
as animal feed in the country, fell 37 percent to 1.42 million
tons as of the end of November from a year earlier, according to
the South African Grain Information Service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
