The yield on  Dana Gas (DANA)  PJSC’s Islamic
bonds maturing in October climbed the most in two weeks ahead of
a planned company board meeting tomorrow.  The rate on the $1 billion of 7.5 percent bonds advanced
165 basis points, the most since Dec. 19, to 38.6 percent at
2:37 p.m. in Dubai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
yield is the highest since March 2009.  “Investors are anxious ahead of this meeting,” Dubai-
based Hans Zayed, head of research and strategist at Rasmala
Investment Bank Ltd., said in a telephone interview today.
“Dana Gas needs to do something for this refinancing sooner
rather than later, because if they leave it to later it becomes
a time issue.”  The Sharjah-based company said yesterday its board will
discuss financing of projects in  Egypt  and the  United Arab
Emirates  and also review its stake in  Mol Nyrt (MOL) ,  Hungary ’s
biggest oil refiner. Dana Gas’s unlisted parent company,
Crescent Petroleum Co. owns 3 percent of Mol, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Dana Gas is in talks with several banks about refinancing
sukuk, debt that complies with Islam’s ban on interest, as well
as about financial strategy, and plans to list its exploration
and production business on the London Stock Exchange, according
to a company statement in November. A Dana Gas official couldn’t
be reached for comment by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
