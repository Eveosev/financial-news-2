Michigan (STOMI1) ’s improved economy will
allow it to finish the 2011-12 fiscal year with a $735 million
surplus, said David Zin, the the Senate Fiscal Agency’s chief
economist.  The surplus is due largely to money left over from the year
that ended Sept. 30, according to a report from the agency.  The resurgence of the U.S. auto industry based in  Michigan 
helped the recovery, according to the report. The state ranked
second for economic health from 2010’s third quarter through the
same period of 2011, according to the Bloomberg Economic
Evaluation of States. It trailed only oil-booming  North Dakota .  Increased growth and revenue are predicted to continue,
though at lesser rates than last year. “Meaningful growth is
unlikely to occur until a meaningful recovery occurs in both the
financial sector and the housing industry, and consumers have
improved their debt-to-income ratios,” the report said.  The Senate agency predicts weaker growth this year than in
2011 -- 0.3 percent compared with 2.2 percent -- and 0.8 percent
growth in fiscal year 2013.  Total revenue of $19.8 billion this year will be 1.5
percent less than in 2010-11. Still, money left over is
producing a general-fund surplus of $691.8 million and a $44.1
million balance for the school-aid fund for the year that ends
Sept. 30, 2012, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
