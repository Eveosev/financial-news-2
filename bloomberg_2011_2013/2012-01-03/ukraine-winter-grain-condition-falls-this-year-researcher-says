The condition of Ukraine’s winter
grains has deteriorated compared with last year, agricultural
researcher UkrAgroConsult said.  Winter grains, comprised mostly of winter wheat, sprouted
on 86.2 percent of the country’s planted areas compared with 100
percent a year ago, the Kiev-based researcher said in an e-
mailed statement today.  About 26.4 percent of the crops are in good condition,
compared with 56.2 percent in 2011, according to the statement.
About 33.5 percent of the plants are in poor condition, compared
with 6.6 percent a year earlier.  Ukraine’s 2012 winter grain plantings rose by 3.8 percent
to 8.39 million hectares (20.7 million acres), according to the
state statistics service data.  Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Kherson, Zaporizhzhya and the
Odessa regions were among the worst hit by poor weather, the
researcher said, adding about 1.5 million to 2 million hectares
of land will need to be reseeded in the spring.  To contact the reporter on this story:
