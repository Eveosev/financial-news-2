Georgia ’s inflation rate advanced to
2 percent in December from a year earlier after reaching the
lowest since 2009 in November, the statistics office said.  The rate of consumer-price increases rose from 1.9 percent
in November, mainly on higher food costs, the office in Tbilisi
said in an e-mail today. Prices increased 0.6 percent from
November.  Inflation, which peaked at 14.3 percent last May, was
forecast to slow toward the end of 2011, according to Zaza
Chelidze, head of the statistics office.  Georgia’s economy probably grew as much as 6.5 percent last
year, higher than the previously predicted 6 percent, Prime
Minister Nika Gilauri said in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
