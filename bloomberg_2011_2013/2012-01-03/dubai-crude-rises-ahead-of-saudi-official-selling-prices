The price of  Dubai (PGCRDUBA)  crude, the
benchmark grade for Middle East oil, rose $1.74 today to $106.58
a barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.  Saudi Arabian Oil. Co is scheduled to release price
formulas on Jan. 5 for barrels bought in February. The state-
owned oil company known as Saudi Aramco is expected to lower
price differentials for customers in  Asia , according to a poll
of 11 crude buyers in  China ,  India ,  Japan , Singapore,  South
Korea , and Taiwan.  Bharat Petroleum Corp. (BPCL) , India’s second-largest state-run
oil refiner, issued a tender seeking to buy low-sulfur crude for
loading in February and March, according to a tender document
obtained by Bloomberg News.  Rosneft Oil Co. sold two 100,000 metric-ton cargoes of East
Siberian Pacific Ocean pipeline crude, or ESPO, late last week
at premiums near $7 a barrel to Dubai, said three traders who
participate in the market. They declined to be identified
because the information is confidential. China International
United Petroleum & Chemical Corp., known as  Unipec (QRAHVZ) , bought the
cargoes for Feb. 13-16 and Feb. 25-28 loading.  Dubai Backwardation  The Dubai swaps  backwardation (PVMMDU1M) , a market situation where the
cost of prompt shipments is greater than that for later supplies,
narrowed today. Dubai for February compared with April fell 1
cent to $1.12 a barrel, according to data from PVM, a broker.
The price difference was at $3.45 on Nov. 14. A decline in the
level shows that demand for oil has weakened.  The February Brent-Dubai exchange for  swaps (PVMMDBSP) , which measures
the European benchmark contract against the Middle East grade,
widened 3 cents to $3.68 a barrel, according to PVM data. The
exchange for swaps for March increased 1 cent to $3.50.  Oman futures for March delivery rose 51 cents to $106.33 a
barrel on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange at 4:44 p.m. Singapore
time with 959 contracts traded. The settlement price was $106.33
at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  No Partials Traded  No Dubai partial cargoes were traded Tuesday, according to
a survey of traders who monitor the Platts pricing window.  Hess
Corp. (HES) ’s Hetco, China National United Oil Co., known as Chinaoil,
and Royal Dutch Shell Plc unsuccessfully bid to buy at $105 to
$105.40 a barrel, while offers to sell stood at $105.80 to $106.  Mercuria Energy SA on Friday bought 500,000 barrels of Abu
Dhabi’s Upper Zakum crude for February loading from  SK
Innovation Co. (096770)  after the Geneva-based energy trader purchased
its 18th and 19th Dubai partial contracts. Under Platts rules,
the deals must be consolidated into one cargo when the same
buyer and seller agree to trade 19 or more of the 25,000-barrel
lots for the same month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
