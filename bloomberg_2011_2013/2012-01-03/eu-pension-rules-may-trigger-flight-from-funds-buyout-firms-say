European Union proposals to make
pension funds bolster their capital may trigger a flight from
private-equity firms, the  European Private Equity and Venture
Capital Association  said.  The EU is considering plans to apply capital adequacy rules
designed for insurers to pension funds, a move that will
penalize investments in private-equity funds because they are
illiquid, said the Brussels-based lobby group, which represents
about 850 firms including Apax Partners LLP and Cinven Ltd.  Regulators are forcing insurers and banks to put more
capital aside for investments considered as risky to avoid a
repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. Pension funds, which have
accounted for a third of funds raised by European firms since
2006, would follow insurers and lenders in selling private
equity assets because those holdings would become too expensive
to hold under the new rules, the EVCA said.  The proposal may cause “a flight by pension funds from
long-term growth asset classes such as infrastructure and
private equity,” the EVCA said in a statement today. “In their
efforts to minimize systemic risk, regulators are in danger of
negating the stabilizing effect of long-term investors.”  Banks have sold about 20 billion euros ($26 billion) of
holdings in private-equity funds in recent years for discounts
of as much as 20 percent because of the “exaggerated” risk-
weightings applied to the asset class, the EVCA estimated.  Private-equity firms are struggling to raise $733 billion
globally as investors wait to get returns from investments made
before the financial crisis before committing to new pools,
according to London-based research firm Preqin Ltd. The firms
raised 46 percent less in the third quarter than in the previous
quarter as the European debt crisis deepened, Preqin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
