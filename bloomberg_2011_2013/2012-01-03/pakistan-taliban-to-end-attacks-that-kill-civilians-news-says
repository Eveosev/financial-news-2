Taliban factions in  Pakistan  have
agreed to end attacks that risk killing civilians and stop
kidnapping for ransom while continuing suicide strikes against
security forces, The News reported, citing a militant spokesman.  Pakistani Taliban fighters would also continue to take part
in attacks in Afghanistan, the paper reported based on an
interview with Ehsanullah Ehsan, a spokesman for the Tehreek-e-
Taliban Pakistan, the Urdu-language name of the Taliban movement
in the country.  Pakistani media have reported conflicting statements over a
possible  peace process  between the government and militant
groups since September, when political parties urged a new
effort at seeking talks. Militants and troops have continued to
fight in several of the seven ethnic Pashtun tribal districts
that form the main base of the  Taliban movement .  Almost 20,000 people have been killed in insurgent violence
in Pakistan since 2009, according to a database maintained by
the New Delhi, India-based  South Asia Terrorism  portal.  To contact the reporters on this story:
