U.K. stocks climbed for a third day,
extending a two-month high for the benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX) , as
manufacturing data added to optimism the global economy can
withstand Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis.  Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ)  and  Barclays (BARC)  Plc led mining and bank shares
higher, rallying more than 5 percent on the first day of trading
for 2012. Burberry Plc rose 4.9 percent after a report the
Chinese government may announce measures to boost  consumer
spending .  BAE Systems Plc (BA/)  advanced after winning an order.  The FTSE 100 soared 127.63, or 2.3 percent, to 5,699.91 at
the close in London. That was the largest jump in more than a
month and pushed the gauge to the highest level since Oct. 28.
The broader FTSE All-Share Index also increased 2.3 percent
today, and Ireland’s ISEQ Index added 2 percent.  “Shares in  London  have made a strong start to the new year
as manufacturing data surprises,” said David Jones, chief
market strategist at IG Index in London. The data has
“galvanized mining shares, with gains across the board for the
sector’s blue chips.”  Stocks climbed as separate surveys showed manufacturing in
China and India improved in December, while Australian output
expanded for the first time in six months. Other reports today
showed production in American factories climbed to a six-month
high last month and U.K. manufacturing shrank less than
economists forecast.  U.S. Economy  The FTSE 100 advanced 1.1 percent last week after U.S. data
showed business activity and home sales in the world’s largest
economy increased more than forecast.  Mining shares rallied today as copper rose to a three-week
high in London trading.  Kazakhmys, Kazakhstan’s biggest copper producer, jumped 9.5
percent to 1,015 pence, the largest gain since September.  BHP

revenue in the Asia Pacific region, rallied 4.9 percent to 1,243
pence. China National Radio said the Chinese Ministry of
Commerce may announce fresh stimulus measures to boost domestic
spending as early as this week, citing Shen Danyang, a spokesman
of the ministry.  Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS)  gained 1.9 percent to 317 pence
as Bank of America Corp. raised its  recommendation (MKS)  for the
retailer to “neutral” from “underperform.”  BAE Order  BAE Systems advanced 3.4 percent to 294.9 pence after the
arms company said it won a 133 million-pound ($207 million)
contract from the Brazilian Navy.  Elsewhere,  Home Retail Group Plc (HOME)  surged 13 percent to 94.2
pence, the biggest rally since September 2008. About 14 percent
of the retailer’s shares are out on loan, an indication of
 short-sellers’ interest (HOME) , according to research firm Data
Explorers. The stock tumbled 56 percent last year.  Afren Plc (AFR)  jumped 20 percent to 103.2 pence as the oil and
gas producer said production was ahead of guidance. Credit
