With Europeans and Asians buying
fewer $65,000 diamond necklaces and $10,000 amethyst earrings,
 Tiffany & Co. (TIF)  may be in for a less-than-glittering 2012.  No U.S. luxury merchant is more exposed internationally.
The world’s second largest jeweler generates almost half its
sales outside of the Americas, up from 38 percent in 2006,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tiffany’s foreign sales
are concentrated in Europe, which is facing a sovereign debt
crisis, and  Asia , where  China ’s growth is slowing.  “It’s better to be a little more conservative for those
other parts of the world,” said  David Schick , an analyst with
Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in Baltimore who recommends holding the
shares. “You are seeing more volatility in the financial
markets. It’s not confidence-inspiring for bigger-ticket
spending. That tells you not to expect too much in the top line
for Tiffany.”  Tiffany’s revenue was $3.09 billion in 2010 and is
estimated at $3.68 billion in 2011, according to the average of
20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Analysts are scaling back their profit forecasts, and
Tiffany shares have slid 21 percent since their 12-month high on
July 19. Over the same period,  Coach Inc. (COH)  has fallen 9.4
percent,  Ralph Lauren Corp. (RL)  is little changed and the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index is down 5.2 percent.  Bigger Impact  Slowing sales growth in Asia and Europe may have more of an
effect on Tiffany’s profits than revenue, Schick said. The
jeweler’s international stores are more profitable because
they’re smaller and located in densely populated areas and so
have greater sales per square foot, he said.  Tiffany’s operating margin in the Asia-Pacific region was
28 percent in the most recent quarter and 21 percent in Europe,
compared with 17 percent in the Americas. That margin is its
operating earnings as a percentage of revenue.  New York-based Tiffany pushed into  Japan  in 1972, selling
primarily within department stores. The company opened stores in
Hong Kong and  London  in the mid-1980s. In the past 15 years it
has unveiled about 80 foreign locations, more than the 60 or so
it has opened in the U.S.  With its signature six-pronged setting, Tiffany helped get
Asians interested in diamond engagement rings, previously not a
tradition in that part of the world. In Europe, the company
positioned itself as a luxury brand with a wider range of prices
than its rivals. Customers could find silver jewelry selling for
the equivalent of hundreds of dollars alongside pieces in the
millions.  International Stores  As of Oct. 31 Tiffany had 55 stores in Asia excluding
Japan, with 32 of those in China,  Hong Kong , Macau and  Taiwan .
It also had 32 in Europe, out of a total 243. In the most recent
quarter, sales in the Asia-Pacific region accounted for 22
percent of total revenue of $821.8 million, making it the
jeweler’s second largest area after the Americas. Europe
accounted for 11 percent.  Ralph Lauren  has little exposure in China; Europe counts
for about one-fifth of its revenue. While Coach, the largest
U.S. luxury leather goods maker, has been increasing its Chinese
store count rapidly, most of its overseas sales come from Japan.
Both New York-based companies generate less than a third of
revenue outside the U.S.  During the summer Europe’s sovereign debt crisis began to
spread around the globe. The euro region is already in a “mild
recession,” with gross domestic product rising just 0.2 percent
in 2012, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development in Paris said Nov. 28. European luxury sales will
grow 5 percent in 2012 after two years of growth over 10
percent, according to a December report from CA Chevreux in
Paris.  Easing Growth  China will expand 8.5 percent this year, the lowest pace in
11 years, the OECD forecast. Luxury-sales growth will ease in
2012 from a forecast of at least 20 percent in 2011, according
to the Royal Bank of  Scotland .  On Nov. 29, during its most recent earnings conference
call, Tiffany cited “recent weakness” in  Europe . Mark Aaron, a
Tiffany spokesman, declined to comment for this story.  Sales will be unchanged this year at European stores open
at least 12 months, according to Dorothy Lakner, a New York-
based analyst with Caris & Co. She forecast a 12 percent sales
gain in 2011. Same-store sales probably grew 26 percent last
year at Tiffany’s Asia-Pacific stores, she said. Lakner is
calling for less than half that growth in 2012.  Expectation Reset  “There has been a reset of expectations,” said Lakner,
who recommends buying the shares “given the strength of the
brand.”  Weakening sales in Europe prompted Schick to cut his
estimate for 2012 per-share profit to $4.01 from $4.10.
Oppenheimer & Co.’s Brian Nagel reduced his estimate to $4.25
from $4.35. The average estimate of 22 analysts is $4.19.  Lakner dropped her Tiffany stock target price to $90 from
$102 on Nov. 30. On the same day, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s
Adrianne Shapira trimmed hers to $70 from $72. Tiffany closed on
Dec. 30 at $66.26.  “For now, obviously the question is, ‘Does the softness
continue?’” Lakner said. “Does it continue for a quarter? For
several quarters?”  To contact the reporter on this story:
