Qatar’s benchmark  QE Index (DSM)  advanced
1.1 percent to 8,880.43, the highest since Feb. 15, at the 1
p.m. close in Doha. Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul All Share Index
climbed 0.2 percent.  The following shares were active in the Persian Gulf. Stock
symbols follow company names.  Banque Saudi Fransi (BSFR)   rose 1.7 percent to 42.50
riyals, the highest close since Nov. 12. The Saudi Arabian
lender part-owned by  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  plans to raise its
capital by 25 percent by distributing one free share for every
four held.  Qatar Electricity & Water Co. (QEWS)   advanced 1.2
percent, the most since Dec. 20, to 141.30 riyals. The shares
were started with “add” and a price estimate of 173 riyals at
Beltone Financial.  United Development Co. (UDCD)   increased for the first
time in three days, gaining 1.3 percent to 23.1 riyals amid
investor speculation that a 16 percent plunge in two days was
exaggerated. The Qatari company that invests in energy and
infrastructure had tumbled after the country’s pension fund said
Dec. 28 it seeks to buy 80 million shares at 20 riyals each.  It’s a “correction,” said Omar Darwish, an equity sales
trader at Cairo-based Commercial International Brokerage.  Yamamah Saudi Cement Co. (YACCO)   climbed for a third
day, gaining 0.7 percent to 71.25 riyals. The Saudi cement maker
said its estimated fourth-quarter profit rose to 191 million
riyals ($51 million) from 160 million riyals a year earlier on
higher sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
