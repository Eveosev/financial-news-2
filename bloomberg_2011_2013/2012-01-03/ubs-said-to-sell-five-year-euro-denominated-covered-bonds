UBS AG (UBSN)  is selling five-year covered
bonds in euros, according to a banker involved in the
transaction.  The five-year bonds may be priced to yield in the low 60
basis-point area over the benchmark swap rate today, the banker
said. BNP Paribas SA, Commerzbank AG, ING Groep NV, Natixis and
 UniCredit SpA (UCG)  are managing the deal with UBS.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
