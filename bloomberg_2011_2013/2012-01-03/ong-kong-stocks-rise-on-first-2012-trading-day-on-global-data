Hong Kong  stocks (HSI)  rose on the opening
trading day this year as manufacturing expanded in India and
 China  and as economists forecast the U.S. labor market will
improve. Chinese refiners gained on a report they may be allowed
to set  oil prices .  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier to Wal-Mart Stores Inc. that
gets more than half of its revenue from the U.S., gained 6
percent.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s No. 1 offshore oil producer,
increased 4.1 percent as crude prices rose. PetroChina Co.
jumped 4.5 percent after the report that China may allow
refiners to set oil-product prices instead of the government.
 China Mengniu Dairy Co. (2319) , a Chinese milk producer, rose 5.7
percent after China International Capital Corp. maintained its
“buy” rating on the stock.  The Hang Seng Index rose 2.4 percent to 18,877.41, its
highest close since Dec. 8. All but six stocks advanced in the
48-member gauge, which tumbled 20 percent last year, its first
annual drop since 2008. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of
mainland companies listed in Hong Kong climbed 3 percent to
10,235.17.  “After the New Year, people are repositioning themselves
again and there is some fresh buying in the market,” said  Alex Wong , asset-management director at Ample Capital Ltd. in Hong
Kong. “The momentum will probably remain on the upside, but I’m
still cautious. At this level, I don’t think people will be very
aggressive in buying across the board.”  Manufacturing Expands  The Hang Seng Index tumbled last year amid concern  Europe ’s
debt crisis and China’s monetary tightening will slow global
growth. Companies in the gauge traded at 10 times  forecast
earnings (HSI)  at the last close, down from 14.4 times at the
beginning of 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index traded at 12.7 times.  Li & Fung jumped 6 percent to HK$15.24, the  biggest gain (HSI)  in
the  Hang Seng Index (HSI) , while Techtronic Industries Co., which
makes Ryobi power tools, advanced 5.1 percent to HK$8.40. Cosco
Pacific Ltd., which operates container terminals in China and
Greece, advanced 4.6 percent to HK$9.49.  The Purchasing Managers’ Index in China rose to 50.3 points
in December from 49 the previous month, the Beijing-
based logistics federation said on Jan. 1. In India, it gained
to 54.2 from 51 in November, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. A number
above 50 indicates manufacturing expanded.  In  Germany , a measure of manufacturing climbed to 48.4 in
December, beating the  median economist estimate (PMITMGE)  for a reading of
48.1.  A report this week will probably show that hiring in the
U.S. accelerated in December, a sign that the country’s
improving labor market will bolster  consumer spending  in early
2012.  New-Year Rally  Payrolls climbed by 150,000 workers after rising 120,000 in
November, according to the median forecast of 62 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey before the Labor Department release on
Jan. 6. Another  report (NAPMPMI)  this week may show manufacturing picked
up in the U.S., economists said.  “Positive economic data provide a catalyst for a small
new-year rally,” said  Pauline Dan , Hong Kong-based chief
investment officer at Samsung Asset Management, which oversees
about $72 billion. “We’ll probably see more headwinds from
Europe.”  Cnooc advanced 4.1 percent to HK$14.14 after crude oil for
February delivery jumped as much as 2.1 percent to $100.91 a
barrel in  New York  today. PetroChina rose 4.5 percent to
HK$10.10 and  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) , known as Sinopec,
gained 5.5 percent to HK$8.62.  The 21st Century Business Herald reported China may let the
three biggest state-owned refiners set oil product prices,
citing unidentified people involved in formulating a plan. The
change would enable refiners to adjust more quickly to changes
in global prices of crude oil, the report said.  Futures Gain  China Mengniu Dairy, which plunged 34 percent last month
after saying moldy feed given to cows led to excessive levels of
a toxin in its milk, gained 5.7 percent to HK$19.20. China
International Capital maintained its “buy” rating on the
stock, and said it expects the company to post 27 percent growth
in net income for 2011.  Gome Electrical Appliances Holdings Ltd. (493) , a retailer of
household appliances, climbed 8.9 percent to HK$1.96. Haier
Electronics Group Co., a washing machine maker, jumped 6.5
percent to HK$7.40 and  Skyworth Digital Holdings Ltd. (751) , a
television maker, increased 7 percent to HK$2.91.  China National Radio reported the nation may introduce
incentives to boost consumer spending as early as next week,
citing Shen Danyang, a spokesman for the Commerce Ministry. The
home appliance trade-in policy that ran from June 2009 through
the end of last year spurred 300 billion yuan ($47.6 billion) of
purchases through the end of November, the report said, citing
statistics from the ministry.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index increased 1.9 percent to
18,810. The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  rose 1.2 percent to 24.92
today, indicating options traders expect a swing of 7.1 percent
in the benchmark over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
