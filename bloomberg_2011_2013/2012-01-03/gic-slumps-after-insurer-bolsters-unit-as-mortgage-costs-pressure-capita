MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG) , the largest
U.S. mortgage insurer, slumped 3.9 percent after putting $200
million of capital into an underwriting subsidiary to continue
writing new policies nationwide.  MGIC contributed funds to a subsidiary to help fund new
business, the company said in a Dec. 30 statement. The unit’s
capital waiver from the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance
for the State of Wisconsin was scheduled to expire at the end of
2011. A separate deal with  Fannie Mae , the U.S.-owned mortgage
finance company, was also set to end then.  The worst U.S. housing crash in seven decades has pressured
mortgage insurers, which pay lenders when homeowners default and
foreclosures fail to recoup costs. MGIC has dropped more than 90
percent since the end of 2006, the last year it posted a profit.
During that time, mortgage defaults drained capital at rivals
including Triad Guaranty Inc. and PMI Group Inc., which were
forced by regulators to stop writing policies.  “We expect MGIC’s capital to diminish in 2012 and
thereafter,” the Milwaukee-based insurer said in the
statement. “Thus, we remain in discussions” with Fannie Mae
and the Wisconsin regulator.  MGIC dropped to $3.59 at 4 p.m. in  New York  and was the
biggest decliner in the 24-firm KBW Insurance Index. Smaller
rival  Radian Group Inc. (RDN)  slipped 2.1 percent to $2.29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
