Brazil  and  Mexico ,  Latin America ’s
largest countries, sold the year’s first emerging-market bonds
overseas, selling at record-low yields as borrowing costs
tumble.  Brazil’s government sold $750 million more of its 4.875
percent notes due 2021 to yield 3.449 percent, while Mexico
issued $2 billion of 10-year bonds to yield 3.706 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Brazil paid 150 basis
points more than similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries while Mexico
sold at a yield gap of 175 basis points.  Demand for the Brazilian bonds surpassed $3.5 billion, said
Surat Maheshwari, head of international syndications at Itau BBA
USA Securities in  New York . Investors sought more than $5
billion worth of the Mexican debt, the country’s  Finance
Ministry  said in a statement.  “It was a very good outcome that shows what the Brazil
story is about and how much investors like it,” Maheshwari, who
helped manage the sale, said in a telephone interview.  Yields on Mexican government  debt fell (JPSYGMEX)  to a record low 4.38
percent on Dec. 27, according to data compiled by JPMorgan Chase
& Co. Average Brazilian borrowing costs reached a record low
4.37 percent on Dec. 13.  “The cost of financing obtained in this sale is the lowest
the government has obtained for this maturity,” Mexico’s
Finance Ministry said in the statement. “That demonstrates the
confidence investors have in the administration’s economic
policies.”  2011 Returns  Brazil’s bonds returned 13.8 percent last year, the most
since 2006, according to the EMBI Global index. Emerging-market
bonds with investment-grade ratings gained 9.9 percent, with
Colombia and Mexico returning more than 14 percent in 2011.  Brazil’s government sold $1.7 billion of dollar-denominated
bonds last year, including $550 million of notes due in 2021 and
$1.1 billion maturing in 2041. In a Dec. 15 research report,
Bank of America Corp. forecast Brazil will sell $2.3 billion in
foreign debt in 2012 to roll over securities coming due.
JPMorgan said in a Nov. 23 report it expects $2 billion.  Standard & Poor’s  raised Brazil’s credit rating one level to
BBB, the second-lowest investment grade, in November, following
a similar move by Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings.
S&P said the country’s “cautious fiscal and monetary policies”
help it cushion the impact of the global economic slowdown.
Mexico is also rated BBB by S&P.  Paribas SA and Itau managed the Brazilian government’s bond
sale, while Deutsche Bank AG and Morgan Stanley managed
Mexico’s. Brazil originally marketed $500 million more of its
2021 bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
