Advanced Petrochemicals Co. (APPC)  of Saudi
Arabia will look again at the volume of polypropylene it sells
to India, which has removed anti-dumping duty on Saudi exports
of the chemical, said Abdullah al-Garawi, the company president.  While Advanced Petrochemicals shipped 1.5 percent to 2
percent of its polypropylene to India before the duty was
imposed, its sales there are small at present, al-Garawi said in
a telephone interview late yesterday.  The lifting of the 6.5 percent duty, imposed in November
2010, was announced in a Dec. 30 statement posted on the  website 
of India’s Central Board of Excise and Customs. The duty covered
imports from companies including  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) ,
the world’s biggest petrochemicals maker, Advanced
Petrochemicals and  National Industrialization Co. (NIC)   To contact the reporter on this story:
