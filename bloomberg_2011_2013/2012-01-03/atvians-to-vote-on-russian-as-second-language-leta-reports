Latvians will vote in a referendum on
whether to add Russian as a second official language on Feb. 18,
 Leta  reported today, citing the Central Election Commission.  At least 771,893 votes, or more than half of the total that
voted in the parliamentary elections on Sept. 18 last year, will
have to be cast in favor of adding Russian for the measure to be
adopted, Leta said. The referendum was called after a signature
drive that gathered support from 187,378 citizens, or 12.1
percent of those that voted in the previous election, the Riga-
based newswire reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
