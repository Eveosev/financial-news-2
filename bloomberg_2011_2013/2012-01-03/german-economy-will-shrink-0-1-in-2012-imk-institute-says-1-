Germany ’s economy will shrink 0.1
percent this year as a recession in the euro region damps export
demand, according to the labor union-affiliated IMK economic
institute.  Austerity measures by euro-area governments are weighing on
demand, making a recession in the 17-nation bloc
“unavoidable,” the Dusseldorf-based institute said today in an
e-mailed statement. That will depress Germany’s foreign sales
and corporate investment, it said.  “Thanks to moderately robust consumer demand, Germany
should be able to avoid a recession this year, but we don’t
expect more than stagnation,” the institute said. “The
positive trend in the labor market as well as the reduction of
the government debt ratio are unlikely to continue in 2012.”  German companies, working off orders for exports and
investment goods, have so far defied a debt crisis the European
Commission says risks triggering a recession in the euro area.
Data today showed unemployment in Germany fell more than twice
as much as economists had forecast in December. The adjusted
jobless rate fell to 6.8 percent from 6.9 percent.  The IMK said its growth forecast for this year is “an
optimistic assessment of the economic situation” as it assumes
that the euro region’s debt turmoil can be stabilized quickly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
