German company  Brenntag AG (BNR)  said its
silicone oils are not intended for breast implants and that it
answered inquiries from French authorities in April 2010 about
the supply of its products to Poly Implants Protheses, or PIP.  Brenntag has not received further inquiries from French
authorities since 2010, the company said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The French Ministry of Health said on Dec. 23, 2011, that
women with breast implants made by PIP should see their doctors
about having them removed following leakage that can lead to
inflammation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
