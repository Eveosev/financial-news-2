The euro may be poised for “new
trend lows” if it sustains losses below $1.2903, Skandinaviska
Enskilda Banken AG said, citing trading patterns.  The 17-nation currency declined to as low as $1.2858 on
Dec. 29, which is the 100 percent Fibonacci retracement level of
its climb to the 2011 high of $1.4940 reached on May 4,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “A move below $1.2903 will now confirm that new trend lows
are under way,” SEB analysts Anders Soderberg and Dag Muller
wrote in a report yesterday. The “violation of $1.2860 spells
further trouble for the common currency,” which may drop to
less than $1.19, they wrote.  The euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.2972 as of 10 a.m.
Singapore time. The currency last slid past $1.19 on June 7,
2010, when it dropped to as low as $1.1877.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. A
break above resistance, or below support, indicates it may move
to the next level. Support refers to an areas where buy orders
may clustered. Resistance is where there may be orders to sell.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
