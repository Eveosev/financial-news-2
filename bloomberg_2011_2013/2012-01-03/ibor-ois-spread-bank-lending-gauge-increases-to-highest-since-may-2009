The spread between the three-month
dollar London interbank offered rate, or Libor, and the
overnight indexed swap rate increased to the most in more than 2
½ years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The so-called Libor-OIS spread, a barometer of the
reluctance of banks to lend, widened to 49.8 basis points at
1:14 p.m. London time, after breaching 50 basis points for the
first time since May 20, 2009. Three-month dollar  Libor (EE0003M)  rose to
0.58250 percent from 0.58100 percent on Dec. 30, the highest
level since July 1, 2009, according to British Bankers’
Association data.  Three-month Libor, a benchmark for about $360 trillion of
financial products worldwide, determines rates on everything
from mortgages to  student loans . It surged to 4.82 percent in
October 2008 after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed. The
Libor-OIS spread ballooned to 364 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
