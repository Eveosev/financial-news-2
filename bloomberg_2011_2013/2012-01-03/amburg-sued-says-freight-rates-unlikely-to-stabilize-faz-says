Hamburg Sued doesnâ€™t expect freight
rates for container shipping to stabilize this year,  Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung  reported today, citing an interview with
Chief Executive Officer Ottmar Gast.  While capacity in the industry may increase 9 percent in
2012, cargo volumes probably will rise only 8 percent, Gast also
told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
