California-blend gasoline in  Los
Angeles  fell to the lowest premium against futures in almost two
weeks after  Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  said the  Wilmington (SHWCCRUD)  refinery finished
work on a process unit.  Carbob in Los Angeles (MOGLDB85)  dropped 4 cents to 20 cents a gallon
above gasoline futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at
2:07 p.m. New York time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the weakest level since Dec. 21.  “Planned maintenance is complete on the unit (unspecified)
at Tesoro’s Los Angeles (Wilmington) refinery,” Tina Barbee, a
company spokeswoman in  San Antonio , said in an e-mail today.  The San Antonio-based company said last week that the
97,000-barrel-a-day planned work that might lead to flaring from
Dec. 28 to Dec. 30. The plant started a process unit Dec. 29,
according to a  filing  with state regulators.  Carbob in San Francisco (MOGSD85P)  fell 4 cents to 16.5 cents over
gasoline futures, also the lowest level since Dec. 21.  The premium for California-blend diesel in  Los Angeles (DIEILCAD) 
against Nymex heating oil futures climbed 1 cent to 4.25 cents.
The same fuel in  San Francisco (DIEISCAD)  rose 0.25 cent to a premium of
3.75 cents.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland (MOGHD87P) ,  Oregon ,
strengthened 4 cents to a premium of 7.5 cents to futures, the
highest level since Nov. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
