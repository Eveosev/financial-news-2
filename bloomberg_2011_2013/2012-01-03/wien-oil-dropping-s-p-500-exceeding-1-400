Blackstone Group LP (BX) ’s  Byron Wien ,
whose prediction for the  U.S. economy  and stock market in 2011
proved too optimistic, said oil will slip to $85 a barrel this
year and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index will exceed 1,400.  U.S. economic growth will top 3 percent while the nation’s
unemployment rate will drop below 8 percent, Wien, chairman of
Blackstone’s advisory services unit, said in his annual “10
Surprises” list published since 1986. Stock indexes in China,
 India  and  Brazil  will rally at least 15 percent, he said.  “The drop in the price of oil and the rise in the stock
market improve both  consumer confidence  and spending patterns,”
Wien wrote in an e-mailed statement today. “Recession fears and
even ‘the new normal’ view of prolonged slow growth are called
into question.”  Wien said in January 2011 that U.S. economic growth and 10-
year Treasury yields would approach 5 percent in the ensuing 12
months, while the S&P 500 would rise toward 1,500. Gross
domestic product expanded 1.8 percent last year, according to
the median economist projection, rates on the 10-year securities
peaked at 3.77 percent and the stock index’s high point was
1,363.61. Wien was correct in predicting a drop in the U.S.
 unemployment rate  and a surge in gold and oil prices.  On Target  The former senior strategist for Morgan Stanley said a year
ago that the nation’s unemployment  rate (USURTOT)  would drop below 9
percent, which happened in November. He forecast gold would
surge above $1,600 an ounce and the price of oil would climb to
$115 a barrel. The precious metal rose to a record $1,923.70 an
ounce while crude futures advanced to $114.83 a barrel.  Wien says his list is made up of events that investors
assign 1-in-3 odds of happening but that he says are more than
50 percent likely to occur.  His 2012 prediction for crude oil implies a 14 percent
slump from last year’s closing level, while the  S&P 500  forecast
would require an 11 percent gain. The benchmark index jumped 1.6
percent to 1,277.06 today.  Strategists at securities firms are more conservative on
U.S. stocks. The S&P 500 will climb 6.4 percent to 1,338 this
year, according to the average forecast of 13 strategists
tracked by Bloomberg.  In 2009, Wien, who was then chief investment strategist for
Pequot Capital Management Inc., predicted rallies in equities,
gold and oil. From 2005 to 2009, he worked at Pequot, which
closed in 2009 amid an insider trading probe by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.  Emerging Markets   Low valuations will boost stocks in  developing countries ,
Wien said. The 21-country  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  tumbled 20
percent last year as growth slowed from  China  to Brazil. The
decline pushed the index’s price-earnings ratio to 10.8, cheaper
than 83 percent of the time since 1995, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The emerging markets finally have a good year,” Wien
said. “Growth slows somewhat but favorable valuations enable
China, India and Brazil indexes to appreciate.”  President  Barack Obama  will run against Republican  Mitt
Romney  in this year’s election with Democrats winning the House
and losing the Senate, Wien said.  Europe  will develop a “broad
plan” to solve the sovereign-debt crisis, avoiding a bank
meltdown, he said.  Wien gave four extra forecasts, including predictions that
gold futures will rise to $1,800 an ounce and that 10-year
Treasury yields, which ended 2011 at 1.88 percent, will climb to
4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
