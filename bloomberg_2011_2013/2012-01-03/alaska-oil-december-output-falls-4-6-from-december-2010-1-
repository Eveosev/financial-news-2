Alaskan crude oil production fell 4.6
percent in December from a year earlier, according to the  Alaska
Tax Division .  Production in December averaged 622,355 barrels a day, a
decrease from 652,064 a year earlier and from 624,687 in the
previous month, according to a posting on the state website.
Output peaked for the month at 641,212 barrels on Dec. 1 and
touched a low of 607,525 barrels Dec. 30.  Alaska production has declined every year since 2002, U.S.
Energy Department figures show, as falling output from existing
wells hasn’t been matched by new additions. The bulk of the
state’s oil is produced in the Prudhoe Bay area.  Oil inventories in the state averaged 3.2 million barrels
for the month, ranging from 847,397 on Dec. 11 to 5.4 million on
Dec. 5. The state corrected an earlier posting that said
inventories touched 329,771 barrels on Dec. 19. Stockpiles were
actually 3,329,771 that day.  Alaskan oil is shipped along the 800-mile (1,287-kilometer)
Trans Alaska pipeline from  Prudhoe Bay  on the North Slope to
Valdez, the northernmost ice-free port in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
