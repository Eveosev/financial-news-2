PDG Realty SA Empreendimentos &
Participacoes, Brazil’s biggest homebuilder by revenue, rose to
a one-month high after meeting its target for new projects.  PDG gained 3.5 percent to 6.45 reais at 12:04 p.m. in  Sao
Paulo . A close at that level would be the highest since Dec. 7.
The BM&FBovespa Real Estate Index advanced 1.6 percent.  The homebuilder’s new projects increased 29 percent to 9.01
billion reais ($4.89 billion) in 2011, according to a regulatory
filing yesterday. The number came at the bottom of PDG’s target,
which ranged from 9 billion reais to 10 billion reais.  “We view the operating results as solid, as PDG managed to
reach its guidance and speed of sales was kept fairly stable,”
Bradesco Corretora analysts including Luiz Mauricio Garcia wrote
in a note to clients yesterday.  PDG’s contracted sales rose to 2.04 billion reais in the
fourth quarter, up 16 percent from a year earlier, according to
the filing. Contracted sales rose 15 percent in 2011 to 7.48
billion reais, the company said.  Brazil ’s housing prices rose 1.4 percent in November from
the previous month, according to the country’s economic research
institute. Inflation, as measured by the benchmark IPCA index,
quickened to 0.52 percent in November from 0.43 percent in
October, according to the statistics bureau, known as IBGE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
