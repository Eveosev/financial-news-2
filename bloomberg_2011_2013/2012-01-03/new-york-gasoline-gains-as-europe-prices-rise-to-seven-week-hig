New York  gasoline strengthened to the
largest premium since November after the fuel rose in Europe to
a seven-week high as Petroplus Holdings AG shut refineries.  Petroplus said Dec. 30 it will start “temporary economic
shutdowns” at its Antwerp plant in Belgium, Petit Couronne
refinery in France and Cressier facility in Switzerland in
January. The sites can process more than 337,000 barrels of
crude a day.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor rose 2.5 cents to a premium of 3.25 cents a gallon
over futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:27
p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the highest
premium since Nov. 10. Prompt delivery of the fuel gained 7.72
cents to $2.771 a gallon.  Gasoline imports to the East Coast have declined for three
straight weeks through the period ending Dec. 23, according to
the Energy Department.  The same fuel in the  Gulf Coast (MOSGR87P)  held at a 5.75-cent
discount to futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
