Additional sanctions against  Iran ’s
oil industry will destabilize world markets, making it an
“irrational” move, Shana reported, citing the country’s oil
minister.  Iran has no difficulty selling its crude, Rostam Qasemi
said at the legal department of the Ministry of Petroleum,
according to the oil ministry’s news website. Iran has
facilitated investment in its  energy industry  by “sweetening
terms of contracts,” Shana cited Qasemi saying without
providing details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
