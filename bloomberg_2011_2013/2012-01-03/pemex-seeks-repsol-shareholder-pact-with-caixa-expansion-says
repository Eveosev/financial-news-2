Petroleos Mexicanos  is seeking a
shareholder pact with La Caixa to combine their voting rights in
 Repsol YPF SA (REP) ,  Expansion  reported, citing unidentified people
with knowledge of the matter.  The Mexican company wants to strengthen its position in
Repsol after its shareholder pact with  Sacyr Vallehermoso SA (SYV)  was
canceled, the newspaper said.  Pemex holds 9.49 percent of Repsol and La Caixa 12.8
percent, Expansion added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
