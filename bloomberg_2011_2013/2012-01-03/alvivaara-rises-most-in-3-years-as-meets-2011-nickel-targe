Talvivaara Mining Co. (TALV) , a Finnish
nickel miner, rose the most in more than three years in London
trading after meeting its 2011 output target.  The stock surged 28 percent, the most since Nov. 26, 2008,
to close at 255.3 pence. The company produced 16,087 metric tons
of nickel last year, compared with a forecast of 16,000 tons, it
said today in a statement. Zinc output totaled 31,815 tons.  Production last year was curtailed by extended maintenance
in April and May at Talvivaara’s plant in Sotkamo, eastern
 Finland . On Oct. 7, the company lowered its 2011 output target
to 16,000 tons from an April estimate of 22,000 to 28,000 tons
and Chief Executive Officer Pekka Pera announced he would quit.  Talvivaara reached a production record of 4,769 tons of
nickel and 10,524 tons of zinc in the fourth quarter, it said in
today’s statement.  “The availability of the metals recovery plant improved
significantly during the quarter and after both production lines
were brought back online in mid-October, was effectively at the
level required to meet the 2012 production targets,” it said.  Talvivaara plans to produce 25,000 tons to 30,000 tons of
nickel this year, the Espoo-based company said on Nov. 17. It’s
targeting zinc volumes of 50,000 tons to 60,000 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
