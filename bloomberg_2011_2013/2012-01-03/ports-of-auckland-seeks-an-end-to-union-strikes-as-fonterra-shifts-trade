Ports of Auckland Ltd. (POA) ,  New Zealand ’s
biggest, has made a better offer to striking workers after
Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd. said it will use other ports to
export dairy products.  Fonterra (FCG) , the world’s largest dairy exporter, will use
terminals at Tauranga and Napier from the end of January,
costing Auckland about NZ$27 million ($21 million) a week, the
port company said in an e-mailed statement. The decision is
directly related to the threat of further strikes at the port,
Chief Executive Officer Tony Gibson said.  Container handling at Ports of Auckland has been affected
by strikes by members of the Maritime Union of New Zealand that
began in December as bargaining over a collective wage agreement
stalled. A.P. Moller-Maersk said Dec. 6 it was shifting one of
its weekly services to Tauranga from Auckland.  “Shippers need certainty and reliable services,” Gibson
said. “The loss of Fonterra’s business means action is
needed.”  The company has made a “final” offer including a 10
percent increase in hourly wage rates, he said. Further  strike
action  is planned for Jan. 9-11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
