The German bank levy could have
collected 2 billion euros ($2.6 billion) over the past year,
compared with the 590 million euros it did raise, had it not
been capped, Handelsblatt reported on its  website , citing
Manfred Zoellner, a Social Democratic Party representative.  Contributions from 56 institutions were limited to one-
fifth of a bankâ€™s profit, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
