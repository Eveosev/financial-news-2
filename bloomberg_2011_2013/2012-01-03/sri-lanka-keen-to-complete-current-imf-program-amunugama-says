Sri Lanka  is keen to complete its
current program with the  International Monetary Fund  and expects
a further tranche release after the next review, even as the
island nation “is not pressed for foreign exchange,” Sarath
Amunugama, minister for international monetary cooperation, said
in a telephone interview today.  Sri Lanka will also not rush into any further currency
adjustments as tourism and remittance inflows help offset
expanding import demand, he said. The government is “watching
the situation” on the current account, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
