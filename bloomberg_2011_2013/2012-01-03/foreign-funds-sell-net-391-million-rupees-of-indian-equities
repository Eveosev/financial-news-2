Overseas  investors (FIINNET)  sold a net  391
million rupees (FIINNET$)  ($7.3 million) of Indian stocks yesterday, the
nation’s market regulator said.  Foreigners bought 4.72 billion rupees of shares and sold
5.11 billion rupees, the Securities & Exchange Board of  India 
said  today . They bought a net 10.9 billion rupees of bonds.  Overseas funds pulled out $512 million from local stocks
last year, versus a record inflow of $29.4 billion in 2010, as
 Europe ’s debt crisis threatened the global economy and cooled
demand for emerging-market assets. The withdrawals led to a 25
percent decline in the  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  2011, the
second worst annual loss, and sent the rupee to an all-time low.  India’s $1 trillion stock market,  Asia ’s fifth-biggest, is
influenced by foreign fund flows. Inflows from abroad surged to
a record in 2010, making the Sensex the best performer among the
world’s top 10 markets. The largest-ever outflow in 2008 led the
biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  Foreign  funds (FIINFIIN)  have placed 4.443 trillion rupees in stocks
and 1.21 trillion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
