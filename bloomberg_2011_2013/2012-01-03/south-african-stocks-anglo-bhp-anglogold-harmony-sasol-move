The  FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index (JALSH) 
gained 2.5 percent to 32,768.35, its biggest advance in more
than a month, by the close of trading in Johannesburg. The index
declined 0.4 percent last year, the worst performance since its
26 percent slump in 2008.  The following were among the active equities in the South
African market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Anglo American Plc (AGL)  , the mining company that makes
up about 9 percent of the benchmark, rose the most in more than
three months, soaring 5.1 percent to 311.20 rand. Copper reached
a three-week high in  London , rebounding from the first annual
drop in three years, on speculation that a pickup in
manufacturing may signal increased demand for industrial metals.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BIL)  , the world’s biggest miner,
surged 6.2 percent to 248.75 rand.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  , Africa’s biggest producer
of the metal, increased for a second day, adding 2 percent to
350.26 rand. Gold climbed in  New York  as a weaker dollar boosted
demand for the metal.  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)  , the nation’s second-biggest
producer, advanced 1.6 percent to 126.54 rand.  Harmony Gold
Mining Co. (HAR)  , South Africa’s third-largest gold producer,
rose 1.7 percent to 96.63 rand.  Sasol Ltd. (SOL)  , which supplies 40 percent of South
Africa’s motor fuel, gained for a third day, climbing 1.4
percent to 391.00 rand. Oil advanced in New York after
manufacturing activity in  China  and India expanded, while
concern persisted that further sanctions against Iran may
disrupt supply.  To contact the reporters on this story:
