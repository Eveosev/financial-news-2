     Jan. 3 (Bloomberg) --  Kenya Electricity Generating Co. (KEGC) , the
country’s biggest power producer, rose for a second day on
expectations it will generate more electricity in coming months.  The stock jumped as much as 6.5 percent to 9 shillings and
traded 3.6 percent higher at 8.75 shillings as of 12:52 a.m. in
the capital, Nairobi.  “There is improved stability in the generation sector
because there has been enough rain that the dams are full,”
Caleb Mutai, an analyst at Nairobi-based Tsavo Securities Ltd.,
said in a phone interview today.  In December there were heavy rains in most parts of  Kenya 
including areas in which the main hydro-power generation dams
are located, according to the east African nation’s
 meteorological department .  Hydroelectric plants account for about 65 percent of the
country’s total power generation, according to the company’s
 website .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
