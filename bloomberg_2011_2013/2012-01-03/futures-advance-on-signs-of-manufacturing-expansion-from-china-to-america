U.S. stocks climbed, sending the Dow
Jones Industrial Average to the highest level since July, amid
signs that manufacturing output is increasing from China to
Australia and America.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  added more
than 4.3 percent as financial shares had the second-biggest gain
among S&P 500 industries.  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  and  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) 
advanced at least 3.7 percent, pacing increases among the
largest U.S. companies.  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  climbed 3.7 percent as the
price of oil rose. Cisco Systems Inc. surged 3.4 percent after
JPMorgan recommended investors buy the shares.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rallied 1.6 percent to
close at 1,277.06 at 4 p.m. New York time, the highest level
since Oct. 28. The Dow jumped 179.82 points, or 1.5 percent, to
12,397.38, adding to its 5.5 percent advance in 2011.  “The U.S. market has been cheering because of the fact the
 U.S. economy  has been performing better,”  Kevin Shacknofsky ,
who helps manage about $5 billion for Alpine Mutual Funds in New
York, said in a telephone interview. “In line with everything
else today, the manufacturing data is better than expected.”  The  S&P 500   rallied (SPX)  14 percent from last year’s lowest
level on Oct. 3 through Dec. 30 as better-than-estimated
economic data fueled optimism the world’s largest economy can
shrug off concern over Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis. The S&P
500 had the 10th best performance among the world’s stock
markets in 2011. The gauge still recorded its first annual
decline since 2008, posting a loss of 4/100ths of a point.  Manufacturing Grows  Manufacturing across the globe showed improvement in
December, suggesting production is weathering strains from
Europe’s debt crisis. In the U.S., a report today showed factory
output grew at the fastest pace in six months. Australian
manufacturing expanded for the first time in six months, while
similar Chinese and  German (PMITMGE)  data beat economist estimates in the
past two days.  Another report showed construction spending in the U.S.
rose in November for a third time in four months. Housing shares
surged today, with an S&P  index (S15HOME)  of homebuilders gaining 2.3
percent. PulteGroup Inc. jumped 3.3 percent to $6.52, while D.R.
Horton Inc. climbed 2.9 percent to $12.98.  “You’re starting to see people want to take more risks,”
 Frank Ingarra , who helps manage the Can Slim Select Growth Fund
at Greenwich, Connecticut-based NorthCoast Asset Management LLC,
said in a telephone interview. His firm oversees $1.4 billion.
“Nobody was really around the last week or two, and now they’re
getting positioned to start the year off with a positive step.”  Financials, Industrials  Commodity producers, financial companies and energy stocks
rose the most among 10 groups in the S&P 500, advancing at least
2.6 percent. The Morgan Stanley  Cyclical (CYC)  Index added 3.1 percent
amid optimism about economic growth.  The KBW Bank Index rose 3.3 percent to the highest level
since Nov. 8. Bank of America climbed 4.3 percent to $5.80.
JPMorgan increased 5.2 percent to $34.98.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  jumped
7.7 percent to $28.33.  ConocoPhillips (COP)  rose 1.8 percent to $74.17, while Chevron
added 3.7 percent to $110.37 after the price of oil climbed 4.2
percent to $102.96 a barrel, the highest level in more than
seven months.  Coal producers advanced after a federal court ruled that
the Environmental Protection Agency must delay implementing air-
pollution regulations.  Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU)  increased 9.5
percent to $36.27, for the second-biggest gain in the S&P 500.
 Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR)  advanced 8 percent to $22.07.  Industrial metal producers surged as copper, aluminum, zinc
and tin rose on speculation stronger gauges of manufacturing may
signal increased demand for industrial metals.  Alcoa, U.S. Steel  Alcoa gained 6.7 percent, the most in the Dow, to $9.23.
U.S. Steel Corp. climbed 6.5 percent to $28.17.  Freeport-McMoRan
Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX)  rose 7.4 percent to $39.50.  Caterpillar, the world’s largest construction and mining-
equipment maker, gained 3.7 percent to $93.98.  Boeing Co. (BA)  advanced 1.2 percent to $74.22. The planemaker
beat Lockheed Martin Corp. to keep a $3.48 billion, seven-year
contract for the primary U.S. shield against intercontinental
ballistic missiles. Lockheed climbed 1.4 percent to $82.02 after
the world’s largest defense contractor received a $1.96 billion
contract from the Pentagon to supply the United Arab Emirates
with a missile defense system.  Cisco (CSCO)  jumped 3.4 percent to $18.63. The world’s biggest
maker of networking equipment was raised to “overweight” from
“neutral” at JPMorgan.  Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. (MJN)  increased 3.8 percent to $71.35.
U.S. regulators said they haven’t found evidence of any
connections between the company’s baby formula and illnesses in
four infants, which led some stores to pull the formula from
shelves.  Tenet Healthcare Corp. (THC)  retreated 3.3 percent to $4.96 after
Citigroup cut the Dallas-based hospital operator to “sell”
from “neutral,” saying the company is “poorly positioned”
and faces “much competition.”  The Fed Minutes  Stocks maintained gains after the Federal Reserve said it
will for the first time make public their own forecasts for the
federal funds rate at their Jan. 24-25 meeting, according to
minutes from last month’s Federal Open Market Committee released
today.  The move marks another stride toward greater transparency
under the chairmanship of Ben S. Bernanke. By releasing their
forecasts, central bankers are likely to alter expectations for
the timing of the first increase in their benchmark rate, which
has been kept near zero since December 2008.  Forecasters at securities firms are more conservative on
U.S. stocks than any time in seven years, predicting the S&P 500
will rise 6.4 percent in 2012 as budget deficits around the
world limit gains.  Strategists’ Forecast  The benchmark gauge will climb to 1,338 after it was
virtually unchanged in 2011 and the U.S. beat every equity
market in the developed world except Ireland, according to the
average forecast of 13 strategists tracked by Bloomberg. That’s
the smallest predicted return since 2005. Adam Parker of Morgan
Stanley, whose estimate for 2011 proved the most accurate among
current analysts, forecast a loss of 7.2 percent as Europe’s
debt crisis will keep volatility above historical levels.  Blackstone Group LP’s  Byron Wien , whose prediction for the
U.S. economy and stock market in 2011 proved too optimistic,
said oil will slip to $85 a barrel this year and the S&P 500
will exceed 1,400.  U.S. economic growth will top 3 percent while the nation’s
unemployment rate will drop below 8 percent, Wien, chairman of
Blackstone’s advisory services unit, said in his annual “10
Surprises” list published since 1986. His forecast for crude
oil implies a 14 percent slump from last year’s closing level,
while the S&P 500 forecast would require an 11 percent gain.  “The drop in the price of oil and the rise in the stock
market improve both consumer confidence and spending patterns,”
Wien wrote in an e-mailed statement today. “Recession fears and
even ‘the new normal’ view of prolonged slow growth are called
into question.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
