German 30-year bonds slid, pushing
yields above 2.5 percent for the first time in almost two weeks,
as stock gains and falling unemployment damped demand for the
perceived safety of the region’s benchmark debt.  Ten-year bund yields earlier reached the highest since Dec.
28, before the country sells as much as 5 billion euros ($6.53
billion) of the securities tomorrow. The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP) 
climbed for a second day, gaining 1.6 percent. Belgian borrowing
costs slid to an 18-month low as it sold three- and six-month
bills, while an 85-day bill sale by the Netherlands drew a rate
of zero.  Austria  will sell 1.32 billion euros of debt Jan. 10.  “People have been a little bit surprised by the relatively
positive economic outcomes that we’ve seen in the past couple of
weeks,” said Elwin de Groot, a market economist at Rabobank
Nederland in Utrecht, the Netherlands. “Apart from that, the
market will be very much focused on the round of refinancing.”  The  German 30-year yield (GDBR30)  rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.47 percent at 4.54 p.m. London time. It
earlier reached 2.51 percent, the first time it has climbed
above 2.50 percent since Dec. 22. The 3.25 percent bond due July
2042 fell 0.525, or 5.25 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to
116.435. Ten-year yields were little changed at 1.90 percent,
after rising to 1.94 percent.  Jobless Rate  Longer-maturity bonds dropped as a government report showed
German  unemployment (GRUECHNG)  fell more than economists estimated in
December. The number of people out of work slid a seasonally
adjusted 22,000 to 2.89 million, the Federal Labor Agency said.
Economists forecast a decline of 10,000, according to a
Bloomberg News survey. The  jobless rate (GRUEPR)  slid to 6.8 percent.  Belgium  sold 1.28 billion euros of three-month bills at a
rate of 0.264 percent, down from 0.78 percent at a previous
offering on Dec. 13. The nation also auctioned 1.155 billion
euros of debt due in six months, paying 0.364 percent, compared
with 2.438 percent on Nov. 29. The nation’s 10-year yields
climbed four basis points to 4.27 percent.  The Netherlands sold 2.99 billion euros of securities
maturing March 30 at a rate of zero, and auctioned 1.66 billion
euros of December 2012 bills at 0.05 percent.  France also issued shorter-dated debt, selling 8.7 billion
euros of 84-, 161- and 315-day securities.  Austrian Bonds  Yields in the world’s leading economies may rise this year
as governments have more than $7.6 trillion of debt maturing,
analysts’ forecasts compiled by Bloomberg show. Led by  Japan ’s
$3 trillion and the U.S.’s $2.8 trillion, the amount coming due
for the Group of Seven nations and  Brazil ,  Russia ,  India  and
 China  is up from $7.4 trillion at this time last year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Austrian 10-year
bonds instead of German bunds increased nine basis points to 123
basis points, while the spread between Austria’s two- and 10-
year yields widened seven basis points to 179 basis points.  “The widening has more to do with what’s going on in
Hungary,” said  Brian Barry , an analyst at Evolution Securities
Ltd. in London. “The Austrian banking sector is one of the most
exposed to central and eastern  Europe .”  Hungarian Sale  Hungary  sold three-month bills at the highest yield since
2009 at its first debt auction since passing laws that
diminished the country’s chance of obtaining international
financial aid. Lawmakers approved regulations on Dec. 30 that
stripped central bank President Andras Simor of his right to
name deputies, expanded the rate-setting Monetary Council and
created a position for a third vice president.  Losses in German bunds will likely be limited as European
leaders struggle to contain the debt crisis, according to  John Wraith , a fixed-income strategist at Bank of America Merrill
Lynch Global Research in London.  “Bunds will return to a safe-haven investment as the odds
are stacked against any riskier assets,” Wraith said.  German bonds returned 9.7 percent last year, the most since
the financial crisis of 2008, when they made 12 percent, indexes
developed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch show.  The German 10-year yield fell to a record 1.636 percent on
Sept. 23 as investors sought a refuge from a sovereign debt
crisis that forced  Greece , Ireland and  Portugal  to seek
bailouts. Italian 10-year yields climbed to a euro-era high of
7.48 percent on Nov. 9 as the crisis threatened to infect the
euro area’s third-biggest economy.  The Italian 10-year yield was little changed at 6.92
percent as the  European Central Bank  was said to buy the debt.
The yield earlier rose to 6.96 percent.  Volatility on Spanish sovereign debt was the highest in
euro-area markets today, followed by Ireland, according to
measures of 10-year bonds, two- and 10-year yield spreads and
credit-default swaps.  To contact the reporters on this story:
