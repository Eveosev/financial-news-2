Oklahoma State beat Stanford
University 41-38 in overtime at the Fiesta Bowl, giving Cardinal
quarterback Andrew Luck a loss in what may have been his final
college game.   Quinn Sharp kicked the winning 23-yard field goal at
University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale,  Arizona , after
Stanford freshman kicker Jordan Williamson missed a 35-yard
field goal attempt as time expired in the fourth quarter and a
43-yard kick to start overtime.   Brandon Weeden threw three touchdown passes to Justin
Blackmon as third-ranked Oklahoma State finished the season with
a 12-1 record. No. 4 Stanford fell to 11-2. The Fiesta Bowl
matchup featured college football’s two highest-ranked teams
outside the Bowl Championship Series title game between No. 1
Louisiana State and No. 2 Alabama.    Luck, a two-time Heisman Trophy runner-up, is projected as
the top pick in this year’s  National Football League  draft. He
completed 27-of-31 passes for 347 yards and two touchdowns.  The University of Oregon beat Wisconsin 45-38 earlier today
to earn the second  Rose Bowl  win in school history and the first
since 1917. It was the highest-scoring game in the Rose Bowl’s
98-year history.   The University of Houston beat Penn State 30-14 in the
TicketCity Bowl, the Nittany Lions’ first postseason game
without Joe Paterno as coach since 1962. Michigan State topped
Georgia 33-30 in triple overtime in the Outback Bowl,  Florida 
defeated Ohio State 24-17 in the Gator Bowl, and  South Carolina 
beat Nebraska 30-13 in the Capital One Bowl.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
