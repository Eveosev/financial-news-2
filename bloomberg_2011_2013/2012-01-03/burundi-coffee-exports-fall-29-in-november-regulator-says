Exports of coffee from Burundi
declined 29 percent to 11,092 metric tons in November from a
year earlier, said Jeremie Ndikumana, head of the commerce
department at the countryâ€™s coffee regulator.  The shipments earned revenue of $51.4 million in the month,
less than the $55.2 million made in November 2010, he said in an
interview Dec. 30 in Bujumbura, the capital. Beans were sold for
a minimum price of $4.64 per kilogram (2.2 pounds), he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
