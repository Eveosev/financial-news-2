The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment dropped,
according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 3 basis points to
178 basis points as of 11:31 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking
Corp. prices show. The gauge is set for the largest daily
decline since Dec. 21 and the lowest level since Nov. 8, when it
touched 177.75 basis points, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  declined 3 basis points to 203.5 basis
points as of 8:31 a.m. in Hong Kong, Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc. prices show. The index is headed for the biggest drop
since Dec. 21, and the lowest level since Dec. 9., when it
touched 200.17 basis points, according to CMA, which is owned by
CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
