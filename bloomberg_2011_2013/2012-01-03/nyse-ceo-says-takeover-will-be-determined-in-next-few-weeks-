The fate of  NYSE Euronext (NYX) ’s  merger (NYX) 
with  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1)  will be determined in “the next few
weeks” as European officials rule whether it will stifle
competition, Chief Executive Officer Duncan Niederauer wrote.  “We have already produced a clear and articulate response
to the commission‘s statement of objections,” Niederauer said
in a transcript of a video message to employees filed with U.S.
regulators today. “The next few weeks will determine the
outcome of this process.”  The operator of the New York Stock Exchange and the
Frankfurt-based exchange company told antitrust regulators they
would impose a three-year ban on derivative-fee increases should
the deal be approved,  Deutsche Boerse  said last month. The
companies also proposed a sale of NYSE’s Liffe single-stock
equity derivatives business to the European Union, two people
familiar with the situation said.  The exchanges, which announced the deal in February, have
been responding to the EU’s so-called statement of objections
since October, as part of the approval process for the merger.
The  company (NYX)  would be the world’s largest exchange operator  The companies last month delayed the deadline for
completing the merger until March 31 from the deal at the end of
2011. The  value (.DUNCAN)  of the deal has fallen to $6.8 billion from $9.5
billion when it was announced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
