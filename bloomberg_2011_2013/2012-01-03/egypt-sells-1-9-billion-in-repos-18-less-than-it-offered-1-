Egypt ’s central bank sold 11.5
billion Egyptian pounds ($1.9 billion) in seven-day  repurchase
agreements , 18 percent less than it had offered.  The contracts allow holders of  government securities  to
sell them back to the central bank to access funds for a week at
9.75 percent, according to central bank data on Bloomberg today.
The regulator accepted agreements valued at 22 billion pounds
last week. It offered 14 billion pounds today.  Banks doubled their borrowings through repo contracts last
quarter to 138 billion pounds compared with the previous three
months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The government
has relied on local banks to fund its  budget deficit  after
foreign investors reduced their holdings of treasury bills in
the aftermath of the uprising that ousted former President  Hosni
Mubarak  last February.  The Finance Ministry yesterday scrapped plans to raise 5
billion pounds from an auction of three-year and five-year
treasury notes after investors sought yields of more than 16
percent, which was unacceptable to the ministry, a government
official with knowledge of the decision said.  The yield on Egypt’s 5.75 percent dollar bonds due April
2020 rose for a third day, climbing six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 8.06 percent at 3:38 p.m. in Cairo. Three-
month non-deliverable forwards for the Egyptian pound, or
futures contracts that provide a guide to expectations for the
currency, weakened 1.9 percent to 6.575 a dollar. The pound was
little changed at 6.033 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
