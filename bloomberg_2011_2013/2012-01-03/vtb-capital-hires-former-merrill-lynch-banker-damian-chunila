VTB Capital, the investment banking
unit of  Russia ’s second-biggest lender, hired former Merrill
Lynch & Co. banker Damian Chunilal as chief executive officer of
its Asian unit.  He will be based in Hong Kong in the newly created role and
oversee strategic development and the company’s expansion in
Asia, VTB Capital said in an e-mailed statement today. Chunilal
will report to Atanas Bostandjiev, CEO of VTB Capital
International and the U.K., it said.  VTB Group’s investment banking unit has been increasing
staff numbers and expanding abroad as it seeks to compete in
emerging markets, while global banks such as  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) 
and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  make cutbacks.  Chunilal, a former head of Asia-Pacific investment banking
at Merrill Lynch, in 2009 filed a lawsuit about a disputed bonus
payment following his dismissal by the firm. The bank argued
that English courts had no jurisdiction. The case was dismissed
by the High Court in London in 2010.  Chunilal was most recently employed at Ocean Capital
Management Ltd. in  Hong Kong , according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
