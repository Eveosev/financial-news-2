David Beckham  turned down an offer to
play for the French soccer club Paris Saint-Germain and instead
will be staying with the  Los Angeles  Galaxy, the French club’s
president said, according to the Los Angeles Times.  The 36-year-old Beckham, a midfielder who was formerly
captain of  England ’s national team, “is in Los Angeles,” Paris
Saint-Germain President Nasser Al Khelaifi said today at the
Qatar Open tennis tournament,  according to the Times . “And he’s
going to stay there.”  Beckham had been negotiating for weeks with Paris Saint-
Germain and the  decision to turn down  the offer had to do with
not wanting to uproot his family, the English newspaper, the
Sun, reported, citing Leonardo, Paris Saint-Germain’s sporting
director.  Beckham could sign a new contract with the Galaxy, possibly
for two years, as early as this week, the Times said. His
original five-year contract, which paid an annual base salary of
$6.5 million, expired after last season, when the Galaxy won the
MLS Cup.  Patrick Donnelly, a spokesman for the Galaxy, declined to
comment in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
