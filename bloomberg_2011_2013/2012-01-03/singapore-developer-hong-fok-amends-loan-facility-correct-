(Corrects Dec. 30 story to show that amendments were made
to the terms of an existing loan.)  Hong Fok Corporation Ltd., a
Singapore-based developer, amended terms of a S$723 million loan
organized in 2007, according to a Singapore stock exchange
filing.  The company at the end of 2011 signed an agreement to
reduce the total loan facility to S$600 million and extend the
maturity until the third quarter of 2014, according to todayâ€™s
filing.  As of Sept. 30, the amount outstanding under the original
S$723 million facility was S$467.3 million, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
