U.K. business confidence in the
economic outlook plunged last month to its lowest level in three
years, according to Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets, which said
there was a 74 percent chance of a recession.  An  index (LTSBBCNX)  of British companies’ optimism about the economy
compared with three months earlier dropped by 3 points from
November to minus 23, the unit of Lloyds Banking Group Plc said
in an e-mailed report released in London today. December’s
reading was the lowest since January 2009.  “The results indicate that the economy will almost
certainly begin the new year with a contraction,” Lloyds
economists Hann-Ju Ho and Jonathan Thomas wrote in the report.
“As this indicator leads quarterly  gross domestic product (UKGRABIQ) 
growth by three to four months, it suggests that economic
activity will progressively weaken during the first quarter and
the start of the second quarter of 2012.”  While GDP expanded 0.6 percent in the third quarter, U.K.
services output fell the most in six months in October,
indicating the economic rebound lost momentum at the start of
the fourth quarter. The  Bank of England , which restarted bond
purchases on Oct. 6 to support the recovery, forecast stagnation
in the last three months of 2011 as  Europe ’s debt crisis dented
confidence and curbed demand.  A measure of perceptions among companies about their
trading prospects over the next 12 months plunged 14 points to
17 in December, the Lloyds unit said.  Recession Risk  The declines in the two gauges suggest U.K. GDP shrank 0.1
percent in the fourth quarter of 2011, with the contraction
accelerating to 0.4 percent in the first three months of 2012,
Ho and Thomas said. The probability of recession rose to 74
percent last month, compared with 44 percent in November and 25
percent the previous month, the economists said.  The Lloyds unit questioned 304 companies, all with sales of
more than 1 million pounds ($1.55 million), between Nov. 28 and
Dec. 15 for the report.  A separate index of new jobs published today by Reed.co.uk,
Britain’s largest recruitment website, fell to 121 in December
from 133 the previous month. Reed’s gauge of salaries gained 1
point to 99.  A quarterly survey of chief financial officers found that a
break-up of the euro area poses the biggest single threat to
U.K. companies in 2012. The CFOs see a 37 percent chance of at
least one country quitting the single currency this year,
according to Deloitte LLP.  The 94 CFOs, who were questioned between Dec. 7 and Dec. 19
for the study, see a 54 percent chance the U.K. will slip back
into recession, Deloitte said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
