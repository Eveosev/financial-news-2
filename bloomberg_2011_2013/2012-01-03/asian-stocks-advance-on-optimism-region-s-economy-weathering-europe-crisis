Asian  stocks (MXAPJ)  rose, with a regional
gauge heading for a three-week high, as manufacturing growth
from Australia, China and India added to optimism the region’s
economies will withstand Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , which gets about 28 percent of sales
from China, gained 1.1 percent in Sydney.  Industrial &
Commercial Bank of China (601398)  Ltd., the world’s No. 1 lender by
market value, advanced 3 percent as trading in  Hong Kong 
resumed.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier of toys and clothes to
retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., climbed 6 percent on
speculation consumer spending in the U.S. will increase after
payrolls climbed for a second month.  “Positive economic data provide a catalyst for a small
new-year rally,” said  Pauline Dan , who oversees $480 million as
chief investment officer at Samsung Asset Management in Hong
Kong. “We’ll probably see more headwinds from Europe.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Excluding Japan Index (MXAPJ)  gained 2
percent to 400.33 as of 6:59 p.m. in Hong Kong, poised for its
highest close since Dec. 8. Almost seven stocks rose for each
that fell in the gauge. The measure posted its first annual
decline in three years in 2011 as China took steps to cool its
property market and Europe struggled to resolve its debt crisis.  Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  rose 1.1 percent, while Hong
Kong’s Hang Seng Index advanced 2.4 percent. India’s Sensitive

the city-state’s economy shrank for the second time in three
quarters. Markets in China,  Japan , Thailand and New Zealand were
closed for a holiday.  Inter-Korean Relations  South Korea’s Kospi Index climbed 2.7 percent after
President  Lee Myung Bak  said a new era in inter-Korean relations
is possible if the North is sincere about shedding its nuclear
program. Kim Jung Un was appointed as head of the North Korean
army following the Dec. 17 death of his father Kim Jong Il.  Chinese lenders and commodity suppliers advanced as
manufacturing in India and China improved in December, while
Australian output expanded for the first time in six months,
separate surveys showed. Data due out today may show production
in American factories climbed to a six-month high in December,

Hong Kong.  China Construction Bank Corp. (939) , the nation’s second-
biggest lender, rose 1.9 percent to HK$5.52.  U.S. Hiring  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.4 percent on Dec.
30 as concern over Europe’s debt crisis overshadowed optimism
that the  U.S. economy  will expand in 2012. Hiring probably
accelerated in December for a second month, a sign an improving
U.S. labor market will bolster consumer spending in early 2012,

from the Americas, rose 1.7 percent to A$1.80.  Energy producers posted the biggest advance among the 10

to set oil prices.  SK Innovation Co., a South Korean energy producer, jumped
6.4 percent to 149,500 won.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s biggest offshore

gained 4.5 percent to HK$10.10, set for the highest close since
Dec. 1.  Consumer Spending  Chinese appliance retailers and manufacturers rallied after
 China  National Radio reported that the government may introduce
incentives to boost consumer spending. The policy may be
announced as early as next week, the report cited Shen Danyang,
a spokesman for the Commerce Ministry, as saying.  Gome Electrical Appliances Holdings Ltd. (493) , China’s second-

Index (SPX)  and 9.9 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
