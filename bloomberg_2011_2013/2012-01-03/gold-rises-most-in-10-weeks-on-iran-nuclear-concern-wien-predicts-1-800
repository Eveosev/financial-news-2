Gold futures jumped the most in 10
weeks on demand for a haven following a report that  Iran 
produced its first nuclear-fuel rod. Silver surged the most in
five months as the dollar’s decline spurred a commodity rally.  A domestically-made rod was inserted into the core of
Tehran’s atomic-research reactor, the Iranian Students News
Agency said yesterday. The dollar fell against a basket of
currencies as global manufacturing expanded, spurring demand for
raw materials perceived as riskier assets. Blackstone Group LP’s
 Byron Wien , who correctly predicted last year’s gain in gold,
said the metal will rally 15 percent in 2012 to $1,800 an ounce.  “Fear trade is back because of Iran,”  Adam Klopfenstein ,
a market strategist at Archer Financial Services Inc. in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “Also, we are seeing
buying across commodities because of the weaker dollar.”  Gold futures for February delivery climbed 2.2 percent to
settle at $1,600.50 at 1:38 p.m. on the Comex in  New York , the
biggest gain for a most-active contract since Oct. 25.  The price rallied 10 percent last year, the 11th straight
annual advance.  “Accommodative monetary policies throughout the developed
world cause a renewed migration to hard assets by individual
investors and sovereign-wealth funds,” Wien of Blackstone said
today in a report.  Last month, the metal slumped 10 percent, touching a five-
month low of $1,523.90 on Dec. 29.  Hedge funds  and other money managers cut bets on higher
prices for gold futures by 4.5 percent to 111,919 contracts in
the week ended Dec. 27, the lowest since January 2009, U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.  ‘Upside Potential’  The drop in bullish bets is “suggesting plenty of upside
price potential once sentiment improves,”  James Moore , an
analyst at TheBullionDesk.com in  London , said in a report.  Silver futures for March delivery jumped 5.9 percent to
$29.572 an ounce on the Comex, the biggest increase since July
13 and the leading advance among 24 raw materials in the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index.  Silver will rise to $40 this year, Wien of Blackstone said.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , palladium futures for
March delivery climbed 1.1 percent to $663.50 an ounce. Platinum
futures for April delivery advanced 2 percent to $1,432.50 an
ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
