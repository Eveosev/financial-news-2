Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA)  hired
banks for what would be its first covered bond issue in euros,
according to a banker involved in the transaction.  CBA will manage the five-year deal itself, alongside BNP
Paribas SA,  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc, said the banker. The bonds will be sold when market
conditions allow, the banker said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
