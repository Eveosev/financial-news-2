The co-chairmen of the steering
committee of the Greek debt exchange talks said “progress has
been made in recent days.”  Charles Dallara  and Jean Lemierre said it’s “essential
that a voluntary agreement be concluded in the days ahead on the
basis of the terms and parameters agreed in Brussels on October
26/27, 2011,” according to an e-mailed statement today from
Frank Vogl, a spokesman for the  Institute of International
Finance .  The IIF, representing more than 450 financial firms, agreed
in October in Brussels with European leaders to accept a
writedown on their Greek holdings to help the country recover.
The swap deal, part of a 130 billion-euro ($169 billion) second
bailout agreement for Greece, is supposed to help the nation
reduce its debt to 120 percent of gross domestic product by
2020.  Dallara is managing director of the IIF and Lemierre is a
senior adviser to the chairman at BNP Paribas SA. They co-chair
the Private Investor-Creditor Steering Committee for  Greece .  To contact the reporter on this story:
