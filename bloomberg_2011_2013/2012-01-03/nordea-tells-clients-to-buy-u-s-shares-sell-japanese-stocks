Nordea Bank AB (NDA) , the biggest Nordic
lender, is telling clients to buy U.S. shares and cut Japanese
equity holdings as American stocks may continue to outperform
other regions in 2012.  Nordea advised its 35,000 Danish private banking customers
to remove a 5 percent weighting of Japanese stocks in their
equity portfolios and instead increase their U.S. holdings to 40
percent from 35 percent, Henrik Drusebjerg, a Copenhagen-based
senior strategist at the bank, said today by phone.  “In the past year U.S. companies performed much better
than global peers,” said Drusebjerg, who helps oversee $230
billion at the Stockholm-based bank. “They’ve reported more
positive earnings surprises and have been better at sticking to
earnings forecasts.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  for U.S. equities lost 0.04
point to 1,257.60 in 2011, the smallest annual change since
1947. The index was the second-best performing benchmark in 24
developed markets after rallying 11 percent in the fourth
quarter as U.S. economic data improved with unemployment
declining to the lowest level since March 2009.  Japanese shares lost 17 percent in 2011 as the country was
hit by a magnitude-9.0 earthquake, which caused a tsunami and
killed at least 15,844 people and triggered the worst nuclear
accident in almost 25 years.  Nordea told clients to maintain a 25 percent stake in
Danish stocks, a 20 percent weighting in emerging market shares
and 15 percent in European equity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
