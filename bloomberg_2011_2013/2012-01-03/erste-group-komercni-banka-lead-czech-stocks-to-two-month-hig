The Czech Republic’s stock index rose
to its highest in more than two months, led by  Erste Group Bank
AG (RBAG) ,  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  and  CEZ AS (CEZ)  and as optimism about the
global economic recovery boosted demand for riskier assets.  CEZ, the country’s biggest power utility, rose 1.3 percent
to 800.9 koruna, its highest close in five months. Komercni, a
unit of Societe Generale SA, climbed 1.5 percent and Austria’s
Erste jumped 2.1 percent. The three stocks comprise 55 percent
of the  PX (PX)  gauge, which advanced 1.2 percent.  Global stocks and commodities rallied as a report from the
U.S. Institute for Supply Management’s factory index showed
manufacturing growth in the world’s largest economy accelerated
last month more than expected. Data published in the past two
days showed a pickup in Chinese and Indian manufacturing.  “The January effect so far shows in stock markets,”  Josef Nemy , an analyst at Komercni Banka in Prague, wrote in an e-mail
to clients today. “The main impulse today was the ISM index of
industrial activity in the U.S.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
