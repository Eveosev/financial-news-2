Participating in the  New York City
Marathon  this year will cost about $60 more than in 2011 because
of increased staging costs, including service charges by the  New
York  Police Department.  The entry fee for members of the New York Road Runners,
which organizes the Nov. 4 race, is $216, up from $156 last
year. The cost for non-member U.S. entrants has increased to
$255 from $196, while international applicants will have to pay
$347 this year, up from $281.  Organizers passed a rise in operating costs onto runners of
the marathon, which had a record 47,763 participants start the
2011 race through the five boroughs of New York. The NYPD this
year is charging the organizers of the marathon and other
sporting events for traffic control and other policing costs.  “We work very hard to keep races affordable while ensuring
a world-class experience for all of our runners,” Richard Finn,
a spokesman for the New York Road Runners, said in a telephone
interview. “The increase in the marathon price reflects both
rising costs for the New York Road Runners and the new fee
instituted by  New York City  on organizations like ours.”  The New York City Marathon opened its lottery system for
entrants yesterday and received 22,795 applications in the first
10 hours, surpassing last year’s total for the first 24 hours.
Finn said about 10 to 12 percent of the entrants are selected
through the lottery, which runs through April 23. Other runners
are guaranteed spots based on qualifying times, club memberships
and past participation.  “It’s important to keep in mind that as a non-profit
organization all the fees are reinvested in our races, our
operations and our programs,” Finn said.  The New York City Marathon featured $600,000 in prize money
for the 2011 event.  Kenya ’s Geoffrey Mutai won the men’s 26.2-
mile (42.2 kilometer) race in a  record time  of two hours, five
minutes and five seconds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
