Coffee prices will remain supported
this year due to climate change and market fundamentals,
according to Santos, Brazil-based broker Escritorio Carvalhaes.  The price of arabica beans rose to a 14-year high of $3.089
a pound in  New York  on May 3 as heavy rainfall caused by the La
Nina weather conditions cut output in  Colombia , the world’s
second-largest producer of the variety. Coffee slipped 5.7
percent in New York last year and closed 42 percent above the 5-
year average, according to data on Bloomberg.  “Climate changes and market fundamentals will maintain
prices in 2012, but we will continue to be tied to the
developments of the euro-zone crisis and its consequences to the
global economy,” the broker said in a report e-mailed
yesterday.  Arabica coffee supplies will match demand in the 2011-12
season started in October after at least three years of
deficits, data from Macquarie Group Ltd. show. Arabica beans are
grown mainly in  Latin America  and favored for specialty drinks
such as those made by Starbucks Corp.  Coffee growers in  Brazil , the world’s largest producer, are
investing in improving yields and bean quality, according to the
Carvalhaes report, with “no significant increases” in planted
area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
