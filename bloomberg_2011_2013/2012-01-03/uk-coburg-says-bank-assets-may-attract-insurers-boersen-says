HUK-Coburg Holding AG Chief Executive
Officer Wolfgang Weiler said insurers might be interested in
buying assets as banks look to shrink their balance sheets,
 Boersen-Zeitung  reported, citing an interview.  Weiler said the market for unsecured bank bonds is “dead”
and that structured loans, such as was seen before the financial
crisis, are no longer acceptable, the newspaper reported.  Weiler added that collateral is “pivotal” to any
investments insurers may make in bank assets, Boersen-Zeitung
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
