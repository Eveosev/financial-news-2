Liverpool forward  Luis Suarez  won’t
appeal his eight-match ban for racially abusing Manchester
United’s Patrice Evra during a Premier League match on Oct. 15.  The suspension will begin immediately after the Uruguayan’s
team decided not to contest the decision of an Independent
Regulatory Commission, English soccer’s Football Association
said today in an e-mailed statement. Suarez will also pay a
40,000-pound ($63,000) fine.  The player was found guilty of misconduct and warned about
his future behavior for using “insulting words” toward Evra
during the 1-1 tie at Anfield, including a reference to the
Senegal-born defender’s color, the F.A. said Dec. 20.  The club said it won’t pursue an appeal as it wants to put
the “matter to rest” and not obscure its efforts to tackle
racism. Still, Liverpool said it disagreed with the decision.  “It is our strongly held conviction that the Football
Association and the panel it selected constructed a highly
subjective case against Luis Suarez based on an accusation that
was ultimately unsubstantiated,” Liverpool said today on its
website.  Suarez  said today  on the team’s website that he “never had
any racial problem with a teammate or individual who was of a
different race or color.”  The player said he would accept the suspension “with the
resignation of someone who hasn’t done anything wrong and who
feels extremely upset by the events.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
