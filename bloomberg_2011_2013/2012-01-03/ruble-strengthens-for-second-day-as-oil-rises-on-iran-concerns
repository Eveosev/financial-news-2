The ruble gained for the second day
against the dollar as oil, Russia’s chief export, rose on
speculation sanctions against  Iran  will disrupt crude supplies.  Russia’s currency strengthened 1.3 percent against the
dollar, trading at 31.7307 at 6:05 p.m. in Moscow, the most
since Nov. 30 on a closing basis.  Oil gained as much as 2.1 percent in  New York  after Iran’s
Deputy Navy Commander Rear Admiral Mahmoud Mousavi told Press TV
that any effort to harm the country’s interests will lead to
“reciprocal measures.”  Rising oil prices helped the ruble,  Benoit Anne , head of
emerging-market strategist at Societe Generale SA in London,
said by e-mail today.  The ruble appreciated 1 percent to 41.33 against the euro.
The moves against the dollar and the euro left Russia’s currency
1.2 percent stronger at 36.0335 against a target currency basket
the central bank uses to manage swings in the ruble. The
currency and equities traded on the  Micex (INDEXCF)  even as many
businesses were closed for a public holiday until Jan. 10.  “Ruble movements right now are a bit misleading occurring
in a low liquidity environment,” Anne said.  The 30-stock Micex rose 2.9 percent to 1,442.41, also the
biggest increase in a month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
