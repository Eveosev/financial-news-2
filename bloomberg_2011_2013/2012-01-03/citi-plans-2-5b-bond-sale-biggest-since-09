Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-largest
U.S. bank, sold $2.5 billion of five-year notes in its biggest
bond offering since 2009 as relative yields on its debt expand.  Citigroup issued the 4.45 percent securities at a yield of
360 basis points, or 3.6 percentage points, more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Citigroup plans to issue $15 billion to $20 billion of long-term
debt this year, according to an Oct. 20  presentation  on its
website.  Average spreads on New York-based Citigroup’s debt widened
208 basis points last year to 402 basis points as concern
mounted that  Europe ’s debt crisis would hinder banks’
profitability worldwide. The extra yield investors demand to own
U.S. bank bonds instead of Treasuries grew 174 basis points to
384 in 2011, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index
data.  Citigroup’s $1.875 billion of 3.953 percent notes due in
June 2016 traded at 98.9 cents on the dollar to pay a 334 basis-
point spread at 3:54 p.m. in  New York , according to Trace, the
bond price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. The debt was issued on June 8 at a 200 basis-point
spread, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Citigroup sold $5 billion of notes backed by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. on Oct. 20, 2009, Bloomberg data show.  Spreads on bonds from JPMorgan Chase & Co., the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, widened 122 basis points to 266 on average
in 2011, while No. 2 Bank of America Corp.’s bond spreads
expanded 310 basis points to 565, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
