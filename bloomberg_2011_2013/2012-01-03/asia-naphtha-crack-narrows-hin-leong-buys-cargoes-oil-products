Asia ’s naphtha crack spread narrowed.
Hin Leong Trading Pte bought gasoil and fuel-oil cargoes in
Singapore, the region’s biggest oil-trading center  Reliance Industries Ltd., owner of the world’s largest
refining complex, may shut units at the newer of its two
processing facilities in western  India  for maintenance next
month, according to two people with knowledge of the plan.  Light Distillates  Japan  naphtha (NAPHJPNC)  swaps were at a premium of $91.12 a metric
ton to Brent crude futures at 2:19 p.m. Singapore time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack spread, a
measure of the profit from making the petrochemical and gasoline
feedstock, was at $90.07 at the end of Asian trading on Dec. 30.  Glencore International Plc agreed with Marubeni Corp. to
swap a naphtha cargo for second-half February delivery with a
second-half March shipment at $7 a ton, based on a Bloomberg
News survey of traders who monitored transactions on the Platts
window. This indicates the market is in backwardation, with
later-delivered cargoes at a discount to prompt supplies.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc, the biggest buyer of  95-RON gasoline (MOGFC95S) 
in  Singapore  last month, purchased 50,000 barrels from Vitol
Group at $119.30 a barrel, the survey showed.  Middle Distillates  Hin Leong bought 250,000 barrels of  gasoil (GASLSICF) , or diesel, with
0.5 percent sulfur from Shell, according to the Bloomberg survey.
The closely held Singapore trader paid 70 cents a barrel over
benchmark quotes to load between Jan. 22 and Jan. 26.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude rose 35 cents
to $17.67 a barrel at 2:49 p.m. Singapore time, based on data
from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This  crack spread (PVMPGDM1)  is the
widest in five days.  Jet fuel (JETKSIFC) ’s premium to gasoil gained 95 cents to 75 cents a
barrel, PVM said. This  regrade (PVMPJG1M)  is the highest since Dec. 14,
signaling it is profitable to produce  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Fuel Oil  Hin Leong bought three 20,000-ton cargoes of  380-centistoke (N6SHS380) 
fuel oil in Singapore, according to the Bloomberg survey. It
paid $14 a ton over January quotes to Kuo Oil Ltd. for two
cargoes and to Gunvor Group Ltd. for one shipment. The supplies
are for loading from Jan. 23 to Jan. 27.  Fuel oil’s  discount (PVMPFD1M)  to Dubai crude widened $2.49 to $4.05 a
barrel at 2:29 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM. That’s the
biggest gap since Dec. 16, indicating losses for refiners
turning oil into residual products.  The premium of  180-centistoke (N6SHS180)  fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade increased 50 cents to $11.25 a ton, PVM data showed. A
wider  viscosity spread (PVMP13M1)  means bunker, or marine fuel, advanced
less than higher-quality  fuel oil .  To contact the reporters on this story:
