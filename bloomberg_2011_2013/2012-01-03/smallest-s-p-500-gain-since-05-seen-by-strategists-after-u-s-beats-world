Forecasters at securities firms are
more conservative on U.S. stocks than any time in seven years,
predicting the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index will rise 6.4 percent
in 2012 as budget deficits around the world limit gains.  The benchmark gauge will climb to 1,338 after it was
virtually unchanged in 2011 and the U.S. beat every equity
market in the developed world except Ireland, according to the
average forecast of 13 strategists tracked by Bloomberg. That’s
the smallest predicted return since 2005.  Adam Parker  of Morgan
Stanley, whose estimate for 2011 proved the most accurate among
current analysts, forecast a loss of 7.2 percent as  Europe ’s
debt crisis will keep volatility above historical levels.  Bulls at Oppenheimer & Co. and  Citigroup Inc. (C)  say record
profits and improving U.S. economic data will propel stocks
after the S&P 500 advanced 86 percent since March 2009. Parker
and  UBS AG (UBSN) ’S Jonathan Golub say the prospect of a global
slowdown will curb investors’ appetite for equities and keep the
rally from gaining momentum.  “The question we pose is, ‘Do you want to be buying it
now?’” Golub, the New York-based chief U.S. market strategist
at UBS, said in a phone interview on Dec. 29. “A year is a long
time. Will there be better entry points than right now? We think
the answer is yes.”  Smallest Change  Shares fell last week after an expansion in the  European
Central Bank ’s balance sheet stoked concern the region’s debt
crisis will worsen. The  S&P 500  lost 0.6 percent to 1,257.60,
erasing its 2011 gain and leaving the measure with the  smallest
price change (SPX)  for any year since 1947. Financial companies led
the retreat in 2011, falling 18 percent, and utilities advanced
15 percent. The index rose 1.6 percent to 1,277.06 today.  Golub says the S&P 500 will climb to 1,325 in 2012, the
same forecast he gave at the beginning of last year. Credit
market conditions, including yields on the  10-year Treasury note (USGG10YR) 
that are below 2 percent, are signaling Europe’s crisis may
worsen in the first half, slowing earnings growth, he said.  The S&P 500 ended 2011 about 8.3 percent below the 1,371
average strategist estimate from 12 months earlier, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The gap compares with a 13-year
average of 7.2 percent and is the biggest miss since 2008, when
the index’s 38 percent retreat left it 45 percent below the mean
projection. Wall Street firms underestimated the measure’s close
by 2.7 percent in 2010 and 3.4 percent in 2009, the data show.  Pared Estimates  Forecasters pared their average 2011 prediction from 1,401
on Aug. 2 after S&P stripped the U.S. of its AAA credit rating,
President  Barack Obama  and Congress struggled over deficit cuts
and Europe was forced to bail out  Greece . The index moved 1.3
percent a day since April, compared with 50-year average of 0.6
percent before the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  “Volatility carried the day,” Jeffrey Schwarte, a  money
manager  who helps oversee about $231 billion in  Des Moines ,
 Iowa , at Principal Global Investors, said in a telephone
interview on Dec. 29. “The market was very top-down, looking at
the macro drivers, and assumed everybody’s going to have poor
earnings going forward. That’s certainly not the case from our
perspective.”  Stock advisers are counting on the same things to spur this
year’s gain as they did in 2011:  profits (SPX)  that are exceeding
analyst estimates, record low interest rates and prospects for
an expanding economy. The S&P 500 rallied as much as 102 percent
from its low in March 2009.  Stock Valuations  The benchmark index tumbled 19 percent from its April high
through Oct. 3 as more than  $3 trillion (WCAUUS)  was wiped from U.S.
equities. For the year, the S&P 500 traded at an average  price-
earnings ratio (SPX)  of 14.1, compared with the five-decade mean of
16.4. The measure is trading at 11.6 times forecasts for 2012
profits, with analysts calling for a 9.7 percent gain to $108.38
a share for S&P 500 earnings, the highest level ever.  Earnings multiples will contract in 2012 as investors
concerned about the outcome of the  U.S. presidential election ,
growth in China and Europe’s debt crisis refuse to pay more for
profits, according to Parker, U.S. equity strategist at  Morgan
Stanley. (MS)  Last year’s 5.5 percent gain in the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  compares with an average of 12 percent in
years prior to elections since the measure’s creation in 1896,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “You don’t want to pay a higher multiple for today’s
earnings knowing that there’s this negative skew as to what can
happen,” he said in a telephone interview on Dec. 28. “About
half of getting a stock right these days seems to come from
bottom-up issues and half seems to come from macro issues.”  Profit Estimates  Parker predicted at the beginning of 2011 the S&P 500 would
end the year at 1,238, 1.6 percent from the close. His forecast
was the lowest in a survey of 12 strategists’ estimates compiled
by Bloomberg and compared with the average projection of 1,371.
In a report to investors dated yesterday, he wrote the benchmark
will close the year at 1,167. His forecast isn’t included in the
average of 12 strategist calls by Bloomberg.  Bulls say rising profits mean the S&P 500’s earnings yield
will expand, fueling gains in prices. Strategists are more
pessimistic than equity analysts about how much earnings will
climb in 2012, forecasting $102.31 a share. That would still
represent the highest level ever.  Brian Belski , Oppenheimer & Co.’s New York-based chief
investment strategist, said he’s never seen investors more
influenced by the economy and government than now. That’s a
bullish signal because it means there are more people who may
change their minds and buy stocks in 2012, he said.  Equity  Bull Market   Belski says the S&P 500 will climb 11 percent to 1,400 in
2012. He forecast the index would rise 5.4 percent last year to
1,325. When he gave his prediction, the average strategist
projection for the end of 2011 was 1,379, according to Bloomberg
data.  “We’re at the cusp of the next great equity bull market,”
Belski said in a telephone interview on Dec. 28. “The U.S. is
not just the best house in a bad neighborhood anymore. It’s the
best house period. This has all been led by the structural
change that corporate America has undergone in the last 10
years.”  The S&P 500 had the tenth-best performance in 2011 among
the world’s stock markets.  China ’s Shanghai Stock Exchange
Composite Index and  Brazil ’s Bovespa slumped 22 percent and 18
percent respectively.  Japan ’s Topix lost 19 percent, while the
DAX Index of German stocks erased 15 percent. Ireland’s ISEQ
Overall Index climbed 0.6 percent, the only benchmark to beat
the S&P 500 among 24 developed markets.  Corporate Cash  Companies built reserves as stocks sank and forecasts for
growth in U.S. gross domestic product in 2012 slipped from 3.3
percent in February to as low as 2 percent in October. Cash at
companies excluding banks, utilities, truckers and automakers
rose to a record $998.9 billion in the third quarter, according
to S&P.  Low investor expectations for earnings growth will help
stocks rise when companies beat estimates, Citigroup’s Tobias Levkovich said in a Dec. 27 interview on Bloomberg Television’s
“Street Smart.” He said in a Dec. 30 report that the S&P 500
will climb to 1,425 in 2012.  S&P 500 companies have beaten Wall Street  profit estimates (SPX) 
for 11 straight quarters. An average of 73 percent of
corporations in the index exceeded analysts’ estimates in the
first three quarters of 2011, with earnings-per-share topping
projections by 5.3 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Markets are going to be moving higher,” Levkovich, the
New York-based chief U.S. equity strategist at Citigroup, said.
Clients who are money managers speculate earnings in 2012 will
be about $95 a share, he said. “So if it’s comes in at about
$100, that’s better than what investors believe.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
