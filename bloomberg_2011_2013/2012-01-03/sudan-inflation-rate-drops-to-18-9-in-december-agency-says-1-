Sudan ’s inflation slowed to 18.9
percent in December from 19.1 percent a month earlier as food
prices declined in the African country, the Central Bureau of
Statistics said.  Prices of food and drinks, the biggest component in the
 consumer price index , decreased by 4.8 percent from the previous
month. Sugar and vegetable costs recorded declines of 4.2
percent and 3.7 percent, respectively, the Khartoum-based agency
said in an e-mailed statement today.  The highest inflation rate was recorded in the state of
North Darfur, where the figure was 42 percent.  Sudan’s inflation is targeted at below 17 percent this
year, while its  budget deficit  is forecast to narrow to 3
percent of gross domestic product from about 5 percent in 2011,
Finance Minister Ali Mahmoud Abdel Rasoul said on Dec. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
