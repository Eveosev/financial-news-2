Indian stocks climbed the most in two
weeks as an improvement in manufacturing signaled Asia’s third-
biggest economy may withstand the sovereign-debt crisis in the
European Union, its biggest trading partner.  State Bank of India (SBIN) , the biggest lender,  DLF Ltd. (DLFU) , the
largest developer, and  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT)  rallied at least 5
percent each on optimism the central bank will cut rates to
revive growth. The nation’s manufacturing gauge rose to a six-
month high in December.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , the most
valuable company, climbed after announcing new investments.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, jumped 421.44, or
2.7 percent to 15,939.36 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai, its
biggest advance since Dec. 21. The gauge sank 25 percent last
year, its second worst annual loss, as Europe’s debt crisis
cooled demand for Indian exports, eroding company earnings
already threatened by record borrowing costs.  “The positive factory data from India and other Asian
countries gave investors something to cheer about,” Kaushik Dani, a fund manager at Peerless Mutual Fund, which manages the
equivalent of $824 million in assets, said by phone from Mumbai
today. “People are hopeful of a rate cut and perhaps that’s why
the interest rate-sensitive stocks such as banking, realty,
metal and carmakers showed an uptick.”  The  Reserve Bank  of India may reverse its record pace of
funding-cost increases as inflation shows signs of easing, the
British Broadcasting Corp. reported yesterday, citing Governor
Duvvuri Subbarao. The RBI in December kept rates unchanged for
the first time in eight meetings as Europe’s debt woes cooled
demand for Indian exports. Wholesale-price inflation slowed to a
one-year low of 9.11 percent in November. The bank’s next policy
review is on Jan. 24.  ‘Complete Reversal’  “Monetary policy in 2012 could see a complete reversal
almost independent of inflation,” Nilesh Jasani, an analyst at
Jefferies & Co., wrote in an report dated Jan. 2. “In 2011, the
policy goal was containing inflation. In 2012, this could shift
to the revival of economic growth.”  Parliamentary gridlock, high inflation, a widening budget
deficit and the weakest quarterly economic growth in two years
dragged  India ’s rupee to a record low last month, increasing
import prices in a country that buys 80 percent of its fuel from
overseas. The Sensex was the worst performer among the 10
biggest markets globally last year in dollar terms.  Still, the Purchasing Managers’ Index in India climbed to
54.2, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said yesterday. A
reading of more than 50 indicates expansion. Measures of output,
employment, orders and exports all increased, HSBC said.  Asia Manufacturing  “India’s politics and economy has tremendous resilience
and in the worst crisis, when pushed to the wall, things start
changing,” Nirmal Jain, chairman of brokerage India Infoline
Ltd., told Bloomberg UTV today. “We have seen this in the past
and things can recover.”  Asian  stocks (MXAPJ)  rose as manufacturing growth from Australia,
China and India added to optimism the region’s economies will
withstand the European crisis. The  MSCI Asia Pacific Excluding
Japan Index (MXAPJ)  gained 2.1 percent to 400.63, its highest level in
three weeks.  India’s S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange
added 2.8 percent to 4,765.30. The  BSE 200 Index (BSE200)  also gained 2.8
percent to 1,904.98. The BSE Mid-Cap Index added 2.4 percent to
5,256.02, the most since Aug. 29.  State Bank rallied 4.8 percent to 1,705.65 rupees and  ICICI
Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC)  added 4.2 percent to 725.8 rupees.  HDFC Bank Ltd., (HDFCB)  the
third-biggest, rose 2.9 percent to 439.15 rupees.  Housing
Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) , the biggest mortgage lender, rose 2.3
percent to 665.2 rupees, halting four days of losses.  Export Earnings  Infosys Ltd. (INFO) , the second-largest software maker, increased
2 percent to 2,864.3 rupees. CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets upgraded
the stock to “outperform” and raised its earnings estimates
for the year ending in March 2013 by 13 percent. Rival  Tata
Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS)  gained 1.6 percent to 1,197.6 rupees.
 Wipro Ltd. (WPRO)  rallied 4.4 percent to 416.5 rupees.  India’s biggest software exporters get at least 80 percent
of their sales from abroad. The rupee’s 16 percent plunge last
year, the most among Asian currencies, is likely to boost the
value of their repatriated earnings.  DLF surged 6.8 percent to 191.45 rupees.  Larsen & Toubro
Ltd. (LT) , the largest engineering company, added 5.1 percent to
1,060.85 rupees.  Jaiprakash Associates Ltd. (JPA) , a builder of dams,
roads and bridges advanced 3.8 percent to 54.65 rupees.  Tata Motors climbed 5.4 percent to 193.95 rupees, its
highest close since Oct. 31.  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) , the
biggest car maker, advanced 1.5 percent to 952.8 rupees.  Media Assets  Reliance, the owner of the world’s largest oil-refining
complex, increased 2.6 percent to 724.65 rupees. The company
controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani will help Network 18
Group founder Raghav Bahl to acquire the assets of a company
that runs 12 regional channels for $395 million. The deal will
help Reliance secure content rights for its high-speed data
services, which it plans to start this year.  Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. (STLT) , the nation’s biggest
copper producer, surged 4.7 percent to 94.45 rupees. The company
raised cathode prices for the second straight month, resisting a
global decline, as the rupee fell and optimism grew demand will
revive.  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) , the biggest producer of the alloy,
climbed 6.1 percent to 361.85 rupees.  Coal India Ltd. (COAL) , the world’s largest producer of the fuel,
jumped 4.8 percent to 327.2 rupees, extending yesterday’s 3.8
percent gain.  Overseas  investors (FIINNET)  sold $512 million of equities in 2011,
data from the  Securities & Exchange Board of India  show. That
compares with a record inflow of $29.4 billion in 2010, which
fueled a 17 percent rally in the Sensex that year and made it
the best performer among the world’s 10 biggest markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
