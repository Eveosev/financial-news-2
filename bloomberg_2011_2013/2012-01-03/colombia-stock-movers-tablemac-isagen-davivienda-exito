The following companies had unusual
price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. local time.  The  IGBC Index (IGBC)  fell 0.1 percent to 12,934.52, while the
Colcap Index gained 0.3 percent to 1,606.48.  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  ,  Colombia ’s state-owned oil
company, climbed 1.1 percent to 4,330 pesos. Oil output in the
South American country will rise to 1 million barrels a day this
month and will likely reach 1.2 million barrels a day in 2015,
according to an e-mailed statement today by the Colombian Oil
Association.  Tableros y Maderas de Caldas SA (TABLEMA)   rose 1 percent
to 10.6 pesos. The wood products maker said in a Dec. 30
 statement  that its Tablemac MDF unit received tax-free zone
status for 15 years. The tax break is “good news” and may have
led some investors to change the price at which they value the
shares, said Juan Nicolas Pardo, an analyst at Valores
Bancolombia SA.  Almacenes  Exito SA (EXITO)  , the country’s biggest
publicly-traded retailer, gained 1.1 percent to 26,280 pesos.
Exito rose for a third day after the stock exchange said in a
Jan. 2 statement that Exito’s weighting in the Colcap Index rose
to 6.3 percent from 4.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
