Ethanol futures rose to the highest
level in more than four week as corn and  crude oil  climbed.  Prices increased as corn, the primary input used to make
the biofuel in the U.S., climbed on speculation demand for
supply will gain as hot, dry weather threatens crops in South
America. Separately, oil surged after an Iranian military
official warned the U.S. against sending an  aircraft carrier 
through the Strait of Hormuz.  “There’s crude oil up over $4,” said  Terry Reilly , an
analyst at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in  Chicago . “Ethanol
was up. It was broad-based commodity buying.”  Denatured ethanol for January delivery rose 3.7 cents, or
1.7 percent, to settle at $2.24 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the highest price since Dec. 5. Futures have declined 5.1
percent in the past year.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast increased
12 cents, or 5.3 percent, to $2.405 a gallon and in New York the
additive jumped 8.5 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $2.405, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf added 5 cents, or 2.2 percent, to
$2.375 a gallon and in Chicago the biofuel declined 2 cents, or
0.9 percent, to $2.255.  Crude oil for February delivery rose $4.13, or 4.2 percent,
to settle at $102.96 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the highest level since May 10. Futures climbed 8.2
percent in 2011, the third consecutive annual increase.  Corn for March delivery added 12 cents, or 1.9 percent, to
$6.585 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
