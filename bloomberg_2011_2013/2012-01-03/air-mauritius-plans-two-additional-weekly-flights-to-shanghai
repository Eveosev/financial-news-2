Air Mauritius Ltd. (AML)  plans to add two
weekly, non-stop flights to Shanghai this year, said Donald
Payen, executive vice president, commercial at Sub-Saharan
Africa’s fourth-largest airline.  The first flight is scheduled for March 26 and the second
for October, depending on demand, Payen said in a mobile-phone
interview today. “We have witnessed tremendous growth since our
first flight to Shanghai with a stopover in  Kuala Lumpur  on July
5 last year.”  Tourist arrivals from China almost doubled to 13,871 in the
11 months through November 2011 compared with a year earlier,
 according to Statistics Mauritius . Payen forecast their numbers
would more than double to 28,000 this year.  Tourism is one of Mauritius’s two biggest sources of
foreign-currency and 1.01 million visitors are expected this
year, according to the Port Louis-based data agency. It forecast
income would rise 4.7 percent to 44.5 billion rupees ($1.5
billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
