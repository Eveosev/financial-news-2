Australia  bowled India out for 191
after tea on day one of the second cricket Test in Sydney.  James Pattinson took 4-43, while Ben Hilfenhaus and  Peter Siddle  each claimed three wickets. Ed Cowan snared three catches
at short leg as Australia’s fast bowlers dominated after India
captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni won the toss and chose to bat.  Siddle ended the Indian innings by having Umesh Yadav
caught behind for his 100th wicket in elite Tests. Dhoni top
scored with 57 not out as India seeks to rebound from a 122-run
defeat in last week’s series opener in Melbourne.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
