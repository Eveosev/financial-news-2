Irish home price declines accelerated
in the fourth quarter, according to property website Daft.ie.  “The typical quarterly fall had been over 5 percent in
2008 and 2009 but was under 4 percent in 2010 and into 2011,”
Ronan Lyons, an economist with Daft. “However, in the final
three months of 2011, the average asking price fell by almost 8
percent, by far the largest quarterly fall yet.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
