The Pittsburgh Steelers will be
without leading rusher Rashard Mendenhall for at least their
first-round National Football League playoff game against the
 Denver Broncos  because of a knee injury.  Mendenhall was hurt during the first quarter of the
Steelers’ win over the  Cleveland Browns  two days ago. Tests
showed he has a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right
knee and will be out until next season,  ESPN reported , citing a
league official it didn’t identify.  Mendenhall, 24, led the Steelers with 928 rushing yards and
nine touchdowns this season after running for more than 1,100
yards each of the past two years. Isaac Redman will replace
Mendenhall for the Jan. 8 playoff game in Denver, where the
Steelers are 7 1/2-point favorites.  “All our guys are capable of toting the ball and being
productive for us,” Steelers tight end Heath Miller said on the
team’s  website .  Redman rushed 19 times for 92 yards and a touchdown against
the Browns after Mendenhall’s injury. He’s rushed for 479 yards
and three touchdowns for the season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
