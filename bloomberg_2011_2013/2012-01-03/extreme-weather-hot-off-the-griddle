Good afternoon, and welcome back to the Griddle, a menu of fortified items for the busy person's media diet. Winds exceeding 100 miles per hour  whip   Scotland . Dry weather from  Ukraine  to  Argentina   threaten  the global grain supply. The northeastern quadrant of the U.S. will be five to eight  degrees  higher than normal next week. And it's only January 3. After last year's  extreme  weather will 2012 be worse? As in all affairs the most reliable expectation should be reversion toward the mean. The only trouble is, the climate 'mean' is changing, and no one knows how fast.
