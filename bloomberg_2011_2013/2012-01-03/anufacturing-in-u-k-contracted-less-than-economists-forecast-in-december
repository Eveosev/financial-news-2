U.K.  manufacturing (PMITMUK)  shrank less than
economists forecast in December as demand increased in Germany
and  China .  A gauge of factory output based on a survey by  Markit
Economics  and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply
rose to 49.6 from a revised 47.7 in November, the groups said in
an e-mailed statement today. The median forecast of 19
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a drop to 47.3
from an initially reported 47.6 in November. A level below 50
indicates contraction.  The sovereign debt turmoil in  Europe , the U.K.’s biggest
export market, has dimmed the outlook for manufacturers, and the
 Bank of England  has said the economy may have stagnated. Markit
said the average reading for the manufacturing index in the
fourth quarter was the weakest in more than two years.  Manufacturing will “likely be a drag on the economy in the
closing months of the year,” said Rob Dobson, an economist at
Markit. “Manufacturers are currently relying heavily on
backlogs of work to prop up production. This is only a temporary
fix, and the trend in overall order books needs to improve if
the sector is to avoid a protracted period of lacklustre
performance.”  A measure of new export orders increased for the first time
in five months in December, Markit said. The gain was led by
demand from customers in  Germany , Eastern Europe and China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
