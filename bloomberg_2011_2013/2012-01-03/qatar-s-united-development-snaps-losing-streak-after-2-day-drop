United Development Co. (UDCD) , a Qatari
company that invests in energy and infrastructure, advanced the
most in a week amid investor speculation that a 16 percent
plunge in the previous two days was exaggerated.  The shares climbed 1.3 percent, the biggest intraday gain
since Dec. 27, to 23.10 at 1:18 p.m. in Doha. The benchmark  QE
Index (DSM)  rose 1.1 percent.  United Development tumbled after Qatar’s pension fund said
Dec. 28 it seeks to buy 80 million shares at 20 riyals each, or
less than the stock’s traded value.  Today’s surge is a “correction,” said Omar Darwish, an
equity sales trader at Cairo-based Commercial International
Brokerage. “It doesn’t have to fall back to 20 riyals
exactly.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
