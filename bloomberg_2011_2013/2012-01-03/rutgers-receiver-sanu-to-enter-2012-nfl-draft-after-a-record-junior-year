Rutgers University wide receiver
Mohamed Sanu will enter this year’s  National Football League 
draft after setting school and Big East Conference records with
115 catches as a junior this season.  Sanu, who’s 22 and from South Brunswick,  New Jersey , led
the Scarlet Knights with 1,206 receiving yards and seven
touchdowns. He finishes his three-year football career at
Piscataway, New Jersey-based Rutgers with a school-record 210
receptions for 2,263 yards.  The 6-foot-2, 215-pound Sanu is rated the sixth-best
receiver prospect in this year’s draft, according to ESPN’s
 Scouts Inc.  service, and is projected as a possible second round
selection. College football’s top-rated receiver, Oklahoma
State’s Justin Blackmon, said he’d enter the draft after
catching three touchdown passes last night in the Cowboys’
overtime Fiesta Bowl win over Stanford.  To contact the reporter on this story:
