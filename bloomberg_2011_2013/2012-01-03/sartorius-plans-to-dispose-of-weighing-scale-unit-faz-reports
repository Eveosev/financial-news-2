Sartorius AG (SRT)  plans to dispose of its
industrial weighing-scale unit to focus on biotechnology and
laboratory medicine,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  said, citing
Chief Executive Officer Joachim Kreuzburg.  The unit, which accounts for 10 percent to 15 percent of
Sartoriusâ€™s sales, is more exposed to economic shifts than the
rest of the company, Kreuzburg said in an interview, according
