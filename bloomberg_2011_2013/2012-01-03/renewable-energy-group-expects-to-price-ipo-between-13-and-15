Renewable Energy Group Inc., the
largest U.S. biodiesel producer, expects to price its initial
public offering between $13 and $15 a share.  The company plans to sell more than 6.8 million shares of
its common stock, it said today in a filing. Shareholders  Bunge
Ltd. (BG) , ED&F Man Holdings Ltd., NGP Energy Technology Partners, US
Renewables Group LLC and West Central Cooperative are offering
an additional 342,860 shares.  Renewable Energy Group registered for the IPO July 18 and
said today it expects net proceeds of about $86.5 million, at
the midpoint price of $14 a share. It will use about $12 million
to buy a production facility it currently leases from Bunge, US
Renewables and West Central in Seneca, Illinois.  Renewable Energy Group owns other manufacturing facilities
in Iowa, Minnesota,  Texas  and Illinois, and three partially
completed plants in Louisiana, Kansas and  New Mexico . The Ames,
Iowa-based company sold 68 million gallons (258 million liters)
of biodiesel in 2010, or about 22 percent of total U.S.
production, according to the filing. Its facilities may produce
as much as 212 million gallons of biodiesel a year from animal
fats, used cooking oil,  soybean oil  and other vegetable oils.  Net proceeds will be $100.5 million, assuming a price of
$14 a share, if underwriters UBS Securities LLC, Piper Jaffray &
Co., Stifel, Nicolaus & Company Inc. and Canaccord Genuity Inc.
exercise their over-allotment option to purchase as much as 1.08
million shares within 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
