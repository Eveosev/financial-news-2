JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, was sued for about $95 million over
 mortgage loans  bundled into securities.  JPMorgan “materially breached” representations about
loans backing the securities, a mortgage-securitization trust
said in a summons filed Dec. 30 in New York State Supreme Court
in Manhattan.  The Bear Stearns trust is seeking damages of at least
$95 million, according to the court filing. Bear Stearns Cos.,
which was acquired by JPMorgan, and EMC Mortgage Corp. are also
named as defendants.  Jennifer Zuccarelli , a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to
comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Bear Stearns Asset Backed Securities Trust
2005-4 v. EMC Mortgage Corp., 650003-2012, New York State
Supreme Court ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
