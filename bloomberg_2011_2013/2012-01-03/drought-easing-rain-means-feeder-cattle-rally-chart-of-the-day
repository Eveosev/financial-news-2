Feeder cattle may extend this year’s
record rally in prices as rain revives drought-parched pastures
in  Texas , encouraging ranchers to rebuild depleted herds, said
Darrell Holaday, the president of Advanced Market Concepts.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows rainfall in Amarillo, Texas,
reached at least 1.54 inches (3.9 centimeters) in December, the
most since November 2010. Feeder-cattle futures surged 20
percent last year, reaching a record $1.508 a pound on Dec. 28.
Feedlot operators buy year-old cattle that weigh 500 pounds (227
kilograms) to 800 pounds, and fatten them on corn until they
weigh 1,200 pounds, when they are sold to meatpackers.  After the worst drought in Texas history, a return of
healthy pastures may mean ranchers keep more young heifers for
breeding rather than sell them to feedlots, Holaday said.
Tighter supplies may send futures on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange to $1.60 by May, from $1.488 on Dec. 30, he said.  Ranchers in the southern Great Plains “are in a lot better
shape than they were a year ago,” Holaday said in a telephone
interview from Wamego,  Kansas . If rains continue, “the demand
to bring calves back down into that country is going to be
phenomenal,” he said.  Texas received about 2.2 inches of rain last month, marking
a second month of above-normal precipitation, State
Climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon said in an e-mail. Even with
recent rains, 2011 will still be the state’s driest year on
record, he said.  The drought forced ranchers to sell more animals rather
than buy grain to feed them, which boosted the feedlot herd in
Texas to 3.01 million head as of Dec. 1, 6 percent more than a
year earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Those
cattle will be slaughtered in the next five months. The total
U.S. herd, including grazing cattle, was 92.582 million head at
the beginning of 2011, the smallest for that date since 1958.
The USDA will release its 2012 herd estimate Jan. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
