of petroleum products, gained 1.4 percent to 3 naira, the
highest since Dec. 23. Oil climbed to a six-week high after
manufacturing in the U.S. and Asia expanded in December and as
concern persisted that further sanctions against Iran may
disrupt shipments.  Kenya Electricity Generating Co. (KEGC)  , the country’s
biggest power producer, rose for a second day, jumping 4.1
percent to 8.80 shillings, the highest close since Dec. 8, on
speculation heavy rains last month will help the company
increase electricity output.  “There is improved stability in the generation sector
because there has been enough rain that the dams are full,”
Caleb Mutai, an analyst at Nairobi-based Tsavo Securities Ltd.,
said in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
