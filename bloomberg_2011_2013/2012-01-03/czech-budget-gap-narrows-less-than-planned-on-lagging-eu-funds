The Czech  budget deficit  narrowed
less than the government planned and exceeded the target in 2011
as the inflow of funds from the European Union was smaller than
budgeted.  The central state budget deficit was 142.8 billion koruna
($7.25 billion), compared with 156.4 billion koruna in 2010, the
Prague-based Finance Ministry said today. The government
targeted a shortfall of 135 billion koruna for 2011. According
to European Union methodology, the gap was 124.2 billion koruna.  Premier Petr Necas’ Cabinet is preparing measures to boost
revenue and cut spending as the debt crisis in the euro area,
the largest market for Czech exports, threatens to curb gross
domestic product growth. The plan to cut the public-finance
shortfall to less than the EU limit of 3 percent of economic
output helped the Czech koruna outperform currencies in Poland
and  Hungary  in 2011.  The public finance deficit, a broader fiscal gauge and a
yardstick for assessing an EU member’s readiness to adopt the
euro, was 3.7 percent of GDP in 2011, less than the targeted 4.6
percent.  The 2012 budget, which targets a deficit of 105 billion
koruna and sets the public-finance shortfall ceiling at 3.5
percent of GDP, is based on an assumption of 2.5 percent
economic growth, while the  Finance Ministry  on Oct. 31 cut the
outlook to 1 percent.  The new forecast carries downside risks and the ministry
may need to amend the budget law if the economy slows more than
forecast or even contracts, Finance Minister Miroslav Kalousek
said during the debate preceding the approval of the budget bill
on Dec. 14.  The yield on the 10-year koruna-denominated Czech
government bond fell 36 basis points, or 0.36 percentage points,
in the past year, compared with a 20 basis-point decline in the
yield on a local-currency Polish government security with a
similar maturity and a 183 basis-point increase in yield on the
Hungarian government debt, according to datya compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
