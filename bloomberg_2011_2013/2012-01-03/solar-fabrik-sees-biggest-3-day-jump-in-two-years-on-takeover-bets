Solar-Fabrik AG (SFX)  had the biggest
three-day advance in almost three months on speculation that the
German solar-energy company may become a takeover target for
Chinese operators shopping in  Europe .  Solar-Fabrik shares rose more than 2 percent today before
closing unchanged at 1.80 euros by the 5:30 p.m. close in
Frankfurt. The early gain added to yesterday’s 16 percent jump
and brought its increase over the past three days to 19 percent,
the most for the same time period since Oct. 10.  The Freiburg-based module maker is a potential takeover
target for Chinese producers because of a successful business
model, access to German sales channels and a “very cheap”
price, Stefan Freudenreich, an analyst with Equinet Bank AG,
said yesterday.  LDK Solar Co., the world’s second-largest panel maker, is
planning the first Chinese purchase in  Germany  with its 24.2
million-euro ($32 million) bid for module maker  Sunways AG (SWW) , it
said.  Solar-Fabrik is in talks with other companies in the
industry, including some from  China , over possible cooperation
agreements, Chief Executive Officer Guenter Weinberger said by
phone yesterday. The manufacturer, which obtains solar cells in
Asia to assemble modules in Germany, isn’t planning to sell new
shares, making a takeover more difficult, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
