Asian currencies rose, led by
Malaysia’s ringgit, after economic data showed two of the
region’s largest economies were proving resilient to slowing
global growth, boosting demand for emerging-market assets.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of stocks rallied 1.2 percent
after a purchasing managers’ index in  India  had the highest
reading in six months in December and a similar gauge in China
rose last month. Financial markets in China and  Thailand  are
closed for holidays today.  “Asian manufacturing data and stock market gains are
supporting some risk appetite,” said Byeon Ji Young, a Seoul-
based currency analyst at Woori Futures Co. “Still, this
sentiment won’t last long as investors are concerned over
 Europe ’s debt.”  The ringgit strengthened 0.7 percent to 3.1480 per dollar
as of 4:06 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  South Korea ’s won advanced 0.4 percent to 1,150.82,
Singapore’s dollar rose 0.6 percent to S$1.2902 and the
Philippine peso gained 0.4 percent to 43.76.  The Indian purchasing managers’ index climbed to 54.2 from
51 in November, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said in
an e-mailed statement yesterday. In  China , the index was at 50.3
from 49 the month before, the Beijing-based logistics federation
said in a statement on Jan. 1. A reading of more than 50
indicates expansion.  Offshore Yuan Surges  Malaysia’s ringgit reached a three-week high on speculation
global funds will add to their holdings of the nation’s assets.
The value of local-currency debt  held (MAFDTOTL)  by overseas investors was
169.1 billion ringgit ($54 billion) in November, Bank Negara
Malaysia said on its website last week. That’s a 40 percent
increase since the end of 2010.  “With the Asian economies showing improvement, global
investors will want to place their funds in this region,” said
Akira Banno, a treasury adviser at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ
Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur.  China’s yuan strengthened 0.4 percent to 6.3188 per dollar
in offshore trading in  Hong Kong  as a non-manufacturing
purchasing managers’ index rose to 56 in December from 49.7 in
November, according to the National Bureau of Statistics and the
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing.  Singapore’s dollar gained even as a government report today
showed the country’s  economy (SGDYTY)  shrank an annualized 4.9 percent in
the fourth quarter of 2011 from the previous three months. The
median of 11 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 5
percent contraction. The economy grew 4.8 percent in 2011 and
may expand 1 percent to 3 percent this year, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Dec. 31.  Indonesia  Growth Concern  “As the economic woes in developed economies continue to
unfold, small and open economies such as  Singapore  are probably
most at risk,” economists led by  David Carbon , head of economic
and currency research at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. in Singapore,
wrote in a note to clients today. “Overall, growth in  Asia  this
year will be slower, led by a soft landing in China.”  Indonesia’s rupiah dropped the most in more than a month
after data yesterday showed exports rose 8.3 percent in November
from a year earlier, the least since September 2009. The
currency weakened 1 percent to 9,170 per dollar, according to
prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg.  Elsewhere,  Taiwan ’s dollar and India’s rupee climbed 0.1
percent to NT$30.294 per dollar and 53.235, respectively.
