China ’s stocks may give positive
returns in 2012 after a “volatile” first half of the year,
Daiwa Capital Markets said.  “From a market perspective, the 2012 risk/reward outlook
is good,” Daiwa analysts led by Mingchun Sun wrote in a report
dated today. The MSCI China Index is valued at a 33 percent
discount to its long-term average, they wrote.  Should a Lehman-type crisis occur in Europe, a repeat of
2008-09 would be “likely” for  China’s economy , though on a
smaller scale, the analysts wrote. “Policymakers seem better
prepared for such a crisis now than in 2008, making China a
likely safe haven in 2012.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
