KBW Inc. (KBW) , a boutique that advises
financial institutions, added James Harasimowicz and Joseph
Gulash as managing directors in depository investment banking.  Harasimowicz is rejoining KBW where he was a principal and
is expected to become head of the firm’s Chicago office in early
2012, New York-based KBW said today in a statement. He was most
recently a founder of Longview Partners LLC, a hedge fund
specializing in financial services, according to the statement.  Gulash, who is based in  San Francisco , joins KBW from D.A.
Davidson & Co., where he headed mergers and acquisitions and
capital-markets transactions for banking companies in the
Western U.S., the firm said.  Harasimowicz and Gulash “bring tremendous track records
and relationships across the banking sector,” Chief Executive
Officer Thomas Michaud said in the statement.  KBW named Michaud, who had been chief operating officer,
CEO in October and said it planned to cut 80 jobs following two
consecutive quarterly losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
