Denny’s Corp. (DENN) , a family restaurant
chain with about 1,600 locations, will raise menu prices this
year to help make up for higher commodity costs and maintain
profit margin, Chief Executive Officer  John Miller  said.  Denny’s “will go out early in the year with a modest price
increase,” Miller said in a telephone interview today. He
declined to specify when the increase will take place or how
much it will be.  The Spartanburg, South Carolina-based company expects food
costs to rise between 3 percent and 5 percent in 2012, Miller
said. Denny’s raised menu prices by about 1 percent in June,
when it introduced its Fit Fare healthier entrees, he said.  Denny’s  rose (DENN)  2.1 percent to $3.84 at the close in New York
and had gained 5 percent last year.  As other chains, including  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) , have announced
price increases to counter the rising costs of ingredients,
Steak ‘n Shake said today that it won’t raise prices this year.  “During 2012, we have no intention of raising menu prices,
especially because we are attempting to insulate our customers
from inflation,” Steak ‘n Shake CEO Sardar Biglari said in a
statement.  Indianapolis-based Steak ‘n Shake, with 489 locations, is
owned by  Biglari Holdings Inc. (BH) , which also owns the Western
Sizzlin chain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
