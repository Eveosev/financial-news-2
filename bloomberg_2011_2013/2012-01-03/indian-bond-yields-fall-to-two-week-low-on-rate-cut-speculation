India ’s 10-year bonds gained for a
second day, pushing yields to the lowest level in two weeks, on
speculation the central bank will cut  interest rates  to support
the nation’s slowing  economy (INQGGDPY) .  Rates on the notes fell 17 basis points in December, the
most since May 2010, as government data showed factory output
shrank 5.1 percent in October from a year earlier in the first
contraction since June 2009. The  Reserve Bank  of India, which
boosted borrowing costs 13 times since the start of 2010 to cool
inflation, sees a “reversal” in its policy in 2012, the
British Broadcasting Corp. reported yesterday, citing Governor
 Duvvuri Subbarao .  “Investors expect a turn in the tightening cycle soon,”
said R.S. Chauhan, chief dealer of treasury in Mumbai at  State
Bank  of Bikaner & Jaipur. “That is pushing bond yields down.”  The yield on the 8.79 percent notes due November 2021 fell
six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 8.33 percent as
of 10:36 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. That is the lowest level since Dec. 20. The rate, which
slid 19 basis points yesterday, is headed for the biggest two-
day decline since May 2010.  State Bank’s Chauhan predicted the central bank will cut
the repurchase rate, currently at 8.5 percent, by 25 basis
points at its policy review on Jan. 24. The  inflation (INFINFY)  rate
dropped to 9.11 percent in November, the lowest level in a year.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in funding costs,
dropped one basis point to 7.71 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
