Berkeley Group Holdings Plc (BKG) , the
U.K.’s largest homebuilder by value, will redevelop offices in
the City of London financial district into 90 homes, according
to documents published on the borough’s planning website.  Roman House, next to the Barbican Estate, will rise to
eight stories from six and include homes ranging from studios to
three-bedroom apartments, according to the plan.  “The development will provide much-needed residential
accommodation, which reflects local housing needs,”
architectural firm Rolfe Judd Ltd. said in a planning statement.  Affluent overseas investors are buying London residential
real estate to protect wealth from economic and political
turmoil at home. Cobham, England-based Berkeley has benefited by
concentrating on London and southeast England, where  house
prices  have been the most resilient.  Berkeley  paid about  10 million pounds ($15.6 million) for
the 8,600 square-meter (92,800 square-foot) site, the Financial
Times reported in August 2010. The building was constructed in
the 1950s and has been vacant since December 2007, according to
the planning documents. Tim Robertson, a spokesman for the
company, didn’t immediately comment.  Heron International is seeking what it says will be the
highest  home prices  ever charged in the City of London in its
36-story building. The Heron, which is due to be completed in
2013, is less than one kilometer (0.62 miles) from Berkeley’s
development.  To contact the reporters on this story:
