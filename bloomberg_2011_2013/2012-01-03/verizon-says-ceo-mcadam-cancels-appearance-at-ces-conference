Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  said
Chief Executive Officer Lowell McAdam has canceled his planned
appearance at the  Consumer Electronics Show  in Las Vegas, citing
scheduling conflicts.  The CEO’s schedule changed and he won’t be able to attend
the conference this year, according to an e-mail from Peter Thonis, a spokesman for New York-based Verizon.  McAdam was scheduled to speak at a Jan. 11 morning panel
discussion on the power of innovation. Fellow panelists included
Xerox Corp. CEO Ursula Burns and Ford Motor Co. CEO Alan Mulally.  The Verizon executive isn’t the only one who signaled less
interest in attending the trade show. In December,  Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT)  announced that it will keynote its last CES this year.  “We’ll continue to participate in CES as a great place to
connect with partners and customers across the PC, phone and
entertainment industries, but we won’t have a keynote or booth
after this year because our product news milestones generally
don’t align with the show’s January timing,” Microsoft Vice
President Frank X. Shaw wrote in a  recent blog .  To contact the reporter on this story:
