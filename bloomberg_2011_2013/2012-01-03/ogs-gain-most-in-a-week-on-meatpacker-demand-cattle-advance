Hog prices climbed the most in more
than a week on signs of increasing demand from U.S. pork
processors. Cattle futures rose.  Meatpackers probably will buy more this week after the
Christmas and New Year’s holidays because of “seasonal”
demand, said Doug Houghton, an analyst at Brock Associates in
 Milwaukee . Demand for commodities also got a boost as the
Standard & Poor’s 500  Index (SPX)  headed for the biggest increase in
two weeks, and the  dollar (DXY)  dropped as much as 0.9 percent against
a basket of six major currencies.  “People are looking forward to the pork market
strengthening as we come out of the holidays, and a restocking
of supplies,” Houghton said in a telephone interview. “A
bounce in overall economic optimism” is also sending prices
higher, he said.  Hog futures for February settlement advanced 1.5 percent to
settle at 85.525 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, the biggest climb since Dec. 23.  Cattle futures for February delivery rose 0.1 percent to
settle at $1.2155 a pound, the first gain since Dec. 23.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement gained 0.4
percent to $1.49425 a pound on the CME.  To contact the reporter on this story:
