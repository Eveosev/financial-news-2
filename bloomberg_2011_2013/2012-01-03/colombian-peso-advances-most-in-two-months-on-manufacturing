Colombia ’s peso rose the most in two
months as signs that manufacturing is expanding in  China  and
speculation factory output increased in the U.S. boosted demand
for higher-yielding assets.  The peso climbed 0.7 percent to 1,916.57 per  U.S. dollar  at
9:23 a.m. in Bogota, from 1,930 yesterday, heading for its
biggest one-day gain since Oct. 27.  A U.S. report due at 10 a.m. is forecast to show
manufacturing grew at the fastest pace in six months. In China
and India, manufacturing expanded last month, indicating Asia’s
fastest-growing major economies have so far withstood the
fallout from Europe’s sovereign debt crisis.  The yield on the nation’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.59
percent, according to the stock exchange. The bond’s price rose
0.222 centavo to 118.987.  To contact the reporter on this story:
