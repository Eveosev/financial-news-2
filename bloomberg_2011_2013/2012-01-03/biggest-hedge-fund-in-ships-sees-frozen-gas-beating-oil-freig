Tankers hauling liquefied natural gas
at sea will earn record rates in 2012 as demand reaches an all-
time high, beating returns from vessels carrying oil and coal,
according to the world’s biggest shipping hedge fund.  The tankers, each holding enough gas to meet about 25
percent of peak daily winter demand in the U.K., will earn as
much as $200,000 a day this year, from $140,000 at the end of
2011, said Andreas Vergottis, the Hong Kong-based research
director at Tufton  Oceanic (OCEHEDU)  Ltd. That means the most profit ever
for Golar LNG Ltd. and Teekay LNG Partners LP, which operate 33
of the vessels, analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show.  Demand for LNG, liquefied by cooling the gas to minus 260
degrees Fahrenheit, is rising as nations from the U.K. to  South
Korea  increase pollution curbs. Gas emits about half the carbon
dioxide of coal. Japan, the biggest importer, is buying more
after closing 89 percent of its nuclear capacity following
March’s Fukushima disaster, eliminating a glut of tankers. Ship
shortages may worsen, with the 372-strong fleet projected to
expand just 0.8 percent this year, Morgan Stanley estimates.  “LNG is a high-growth, high-profit industry,” said
Vergottis, whose research is used by the $1.45 billion Oceanic
Hedge Fund, which gained 6.8 percent in the first 11 months of
the year as the Lloyd’s List/Bloomberg Index of the 50 largest
 shipping companies (LLSIVAL)  slumped 39 percent. “Next year looks even
more hot. There’s not a single cloud for two years.”  The cost of hiring an LNG tanker for a year or more
averaged $97,630 a day in 2011, from $43,663 in 2010, according
to Fearnley LNG, an Oslo-based consultant and brokerage that’s a
unit of the Astrup Fearnley Group.  Maritime Routes  That compares with last year’s 90 percent decline in rates
for the largest  oil tankers  to $1,214 a day as the biggest fleet
in about three decades overwhelmed demand, data from the London-
based Baltic Exchange show. Capesizes hauling coal and iron ore
averaged $15,639 a day last year, from $33,298 in 2010,
according to the bourse, which publishes freight costs for more
than 50 maritime routes.  Global LNG demand may expand 7.5 percent this year to 258
million metric tons, led by Japan, China and  India , according to
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., a New York-based researcher. World
capacity to produce the fuel will rise 61 percent in the decade
to 2020, Morgan Stanley estimates.  Shipping companies will struggle to keep up. There are 60
tankers on order at yards, mostly in South Korea and  China ,
equal to about 17 percent of the existing fleet, data from
Redhill, England-based IHS Fairplay show.  Trade and Development  Construction is lagging behind the surge in demand, partly
because of costs. A new gas carrier sold for $210 million in
2010, compared with $99 million for the largest oil tankers and
$57 million for capesizes, according to the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development. They need equipment to hold
about 155,000 cubic meters (5.5 million cubic feet) of frozen
liquid that expands to 95 million cubic meters in gas form.  The vessel shortage may ease as rates increase. Returns are
high enough to cover building costs in about three years, said
Vergottis. The tankers may account for as much as 20 percent of
the merchant fleet within a quarter century, from about 5
percent now, said the 50-year-old research director, who is
working on a project to collate shipping rates for all major
vessel classes going back to 1850.  The anticipated surge in LNG demand may be curbed should
growth slow. The global economy will expand 2.3 percent this
year, compared with 2.7 percent in 2011 and 4 percent in 2010,
according to a composite of economists’ regional forecasts
compiled by Bloomberg. About 90 percent of world trade moves by
sea, the Round Table of Shipping Associations estimates.  Four Decades  Natural-gas consumption fell 2.6 percent in 2009, the most
since at least 1965, as economies contended with the worst
global recession since World War II, according to data from
London-based BP Plc. Demand in  Japan , which accounts for about
32 percent of all LNG imports, retreated 6.7 percent, also the
biggest decline in more than four decades.  Not all owners may benefit from higher rates. Companies
typically lease out tankers on long-term charters at fixed
prices. Of the total fleet of 372 vessels, 44 were available for
hire as of the middle of last month, according to Morgan
Stanley. Awilco LNG AS, based in Oslo, has its three vessels
chartered out until at least August, and Hamilton, Bermuda-based
Hoegh LNG Holdings Ltd. has all of its fleet leased on longer
duration charters, according to their websites.  Analyst Estimates  Golar controls more than 25 percent of the available vessel
supply over the next three years, according to Morgan Stanley.
The Hamilton, Bermuda-based company will report net income of
$168.1 million for this year, compared with a predicted $70.7
million for 2011, the mean of 12 analyst estimates shows. Its
shares almost tripled to 263.8 kroner last year in Oslo trading
and will reach 283.05 kroner in the next 12 months, according to
the average of 10 analyst estimates.  Teekay LNG Partners (TGP)  will report profit of $107.9 million
for 2012, compared with a projected $83.9 million last year, the
mean of four estimates shows. Shares of the Nassau, Bahamas-
based company fell 13 percent to $33.17 in New York trading in
2011 and will reach $38.20 in 12 months, the average of five
estimates shows.  Natural gas’s share of global energy demand will climb to
23 percent by 2035 from 21 percent now as oil’s contribution
declines to 27 percent from 33 percent, according to the Paris-
based  International Energy Agency . LNG is contributing to the
gain because it links consumers with producers that may be too
far apart to connect by pipeline. Qatar, the biggest LNG
supplier, is about 5,000 miles from Japan.  Biggest Shipbroker  The first LNG shipment went from  Lake Charles  in  Louisiana 
to the U.K. in 1959 and the industry has now expanded to import
facilities in 23 countries, according to London-based Clarkson
Plc, the world’s biggest shipbroker.  For  shipping companies (GOL) , stronger LNG demand echoes what
happened when oil started displacing coal as an energy source in
the first half of the 20th century, said Vergottis, whose family
has owned ships for four centuries. That shift took oil tankers
from a niche vessel class to the dominant type in energy
transportation by the 1970s, he said.  “The same is happening with LNG,” Vergottis said. “LNG
is earning a 25 percent return on capital. A tanker is earning
minus three. LNG is the growth part of the market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
