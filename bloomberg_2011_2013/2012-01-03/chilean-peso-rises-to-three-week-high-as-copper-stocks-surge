Chile ’s peso retreated from the
biggest gain since November as slumping copper prices signaled a
diminished  trade surplus  for the metal’s top-producing nation.  The peso depreciated 0.2 percent to 513.08 per  U.S. dollar 
at 10:43 a.m. in Santiago. The currency rallied 1.2 percent
yesterday.  Copper, which accounts for half of Chile’s exports, lost as
much as 1.7 percent in New York as China’s home prices fell for
a fourth month and Societe Generale SA said the metal may be
poised to drop almost 10 percent on mounting concern about a
global economic slowdown. European stocks fell from a five-month
high on concern that banks will need to raise more capital.  “The peso is moving in line with copper prices after
economic data from  China  came in lower than expected,” Eugenio Cortes, head of currency forwards at Euroamerica Corredores de
Bolsa SA. “It’s also suffering a correction after gains in the
first two days of the year. However, if it remains below 515 I
believe it will trend to levels of 505 or 506 per dollar.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
