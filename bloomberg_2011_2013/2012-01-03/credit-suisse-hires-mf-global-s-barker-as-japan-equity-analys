Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  hired Stephen Barker, an analyst at MF Global Holdings Inc. before its
collapse, to cover medium-sized Japanese companies, according to
a Credit Suisse document obtained by Bloomberg News.  Barker will begin today at Credit Suisse as an equities
analyst and director in Tokyo, the document said. The 45-year-
old, who covered companies including beermaker Kirin Holdings Co.
and Taiko Pharmaceutical Co. at MF Global’s  Japan unit , worked
at the company until the end of October, according to Akemi
Fujishiro, an executive assistant. Barker declined to comment on
the matter when reached by phone.  The hire comes after Credit Suisse last year added analysts
in  Japan  to cover autopart makers, transportation and banking.
MF Global filed the eighth-largest U.S. bankruptcy on Oct. 31
after making losing bets on European bonds, and investment banks
including Credit Suisse and UBS AG have been recruiting the
company’s former employees.  To contact the reporters on this story:
