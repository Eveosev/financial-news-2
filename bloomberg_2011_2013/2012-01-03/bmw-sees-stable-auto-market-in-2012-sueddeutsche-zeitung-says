Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  expects
the automotive market to remain stable in 2012, with growth
opportunities in the U.S. and  China ,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung 
reported, citing Chief Financial Officer Friedrich Eichiner.  Worldwide the market should grow by 4 percent and the
premium car market by 8 percent, Eichiner told the newspaper in
an interview. He said that if the euro “fails” and  Germany  had
to return to the deutschmark, it would be “devastating” and
everything should be done to stop it, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
