Canada ’s dollar may appreciate to a
two-month high if it closes above its 100-day moving average
against the U.S. currency, according to Bank of America Corp.  A close stronger than that technical level would be its
first since August and may spur the currency to parity,
according to  MacNeil Curry , head of foreign-exchange and
interest-rates technical strategy at Bank of America. The
loonie, as the Canadian currency is also known, last traded on a
one-for-one basis with the greenback on Nov. 1.  “You’re seeing broad-based dollar weakness,” Curry said
in a telephone interview from New York. “It’s targeting a move
toward parity. You have a pretty decent rally transpiring in
risk” assets.  Canada’s dollar appreciated 0.9 percent to C$1.0097 per
 U.S. dollar  at 12:44 p.m. Toronto time. The loonie touched
C$1.0077, its strongest level since Dec. 8. One Canadian dollar
buys 99.04 U.S. cents.  The loonie’s 100-day moving average is C$1.0143, and a move
to parity may prompt further appreciation to the 200-day moving
average of 99.03 Canadian cents, Curry wrote in a research
report today.  The Canadian dollar is getting a boost from overextended
long positions in the U.S. dollar, or bets it will rally,
according to Curry.  Futures traders increased net bets that the greenback will
rise against the currencies of Japan, the euro zone, Australia,
Switzerland, Canada, Britain, Mexico and  New Zealand  to 158,719
contracts last week, compared with a record high 166,591 reached
in November.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
