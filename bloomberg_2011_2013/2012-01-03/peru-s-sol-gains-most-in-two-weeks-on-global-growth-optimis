Peru ’s sol advanced the most in two
weeks as optimism that growth in the U.S. and China will offset
stagnation in Europe spurred demand for higher-yielding,
emerging-market assets.  The sol strengthened 0.1 percent to 2.6940 per  U.S. dollar 
at 11:25 a.m. Lima time, from 2.6980 yesterday, according to
Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  The Institute for Supply Management’s factory index topped
estimates and U.S. government data showed construction spending
grew at more than twice the forecast rate. Reports in the past
two days showed a pickup in Chinese and Indian manufacturing.
Copper, Peru’s top export, climbed in  New York .  “The world is looking at 2012 with a bit more optimism,”
said Gonzalo Navarro, the head trader at  Banco Santander  in
Lima. “It seems like investors see more room for asset prices
to increase than decline.”  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 5.73 percent, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. The bond’s price rose 0.13 centimo to 114.17 centimos
per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
