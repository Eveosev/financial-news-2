Residential Capital LLC’s bonds rose
after a report that  Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY)  won’t put the mortgage-
lending unit into bankruptcy.  ResCap’s $2.12 billion of 9.625 percent notes due in May
2015 climbed 5.8 cents to 76.3 cents on the dollar at 10:02 a.m.
in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. That’s the
highest level since Nov. 8, before Ally was reported to have
hired advisers to weigh options for the unit.  Ally, the former financing arm of automaker General Motors
Corp., won’t put ResCap into bankruptcy because of the risk of
lawsuits by creditors, the New York Post reported today, citing
sources it didn’t identify. Gina Proia, a spokeswoman for
Detroit-based Ally, didn’t immediately respond to a phone call
and an e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
