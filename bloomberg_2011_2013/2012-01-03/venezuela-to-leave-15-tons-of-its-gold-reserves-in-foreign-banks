Venezuela  will leave 15 tons of gold
reserves in banks outside the country, Central Bank president
Nelson Merentes said today.  Venezuela held about 211 tons of its gold in Europe, Canada
and Switzerland before it started repatriating the reserves last
year, Merentes said on national radio.  “It wasn’t necessary to have that much gold abroad for
financial transactions,” Merentes said. “We’re going to keep
bringing it back. Soon we will have the majority of our reserves
in the Central Bank vault.”  President  Hugo Chavez  ordered the Central Bank to
repatriate $11 billion of gold in August as a safeguard against
instability in financial markets. The country received the first
shipment of repatriated gold on Nov. 25.  The country has a total of 365 tons of  gold reserves ,
Merentes said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
