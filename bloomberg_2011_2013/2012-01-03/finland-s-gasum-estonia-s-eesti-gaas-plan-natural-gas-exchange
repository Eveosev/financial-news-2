Finland ’s natural gas supplier Gasum
Oy and its Estonian counterpart Eesti Gaas AS agreed to set up
an exchange in the Baltic country.  A memorandum of understanding, signed on Dec. 21, is part
of a long-term goal of a single natural gas market covering
Finland,  Estonia ,  Latvia  and  Lithuania , the companies said in a
joint statement today on the Gasum Oy website. A similar
agreement was signed between Gasum and Lithuania’s  AB Lietuvos
Dujos (LDJ1L)  in November, they added.  A joint Finnish-Baltic market would also benefit from plans
to build liquefied natural gas terminals in the region,
according to the statement. The three Baltic nations are seeking
European Union support to build such a terminal, saying they’re
being charged more for Russian gas imports than western European
countries and citing supply risks.  Russia’s  OAO Gazprom (GAZP) , the sole supplier of gas to Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania, and  Germany ’s  E.ON AG (EOAN)  are among the
biggest shareholders in Gasum as well as Eesti Gaas and Lietuvos
Dujos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
