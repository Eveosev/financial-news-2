Indonesia’s rupiah retreated for a
second day on concern  Southeast Asia ’s biggest economy is
slowing. Bonds advanced.  Inflation cooled for a fourth straight month in December to
the lowest level since March 2010, the  Central Bureau of
Statistics  said yesterday, giving the central scope to cut
borrowing costs when it meets on Jan. 12. Exports rose 8.3
percent in November from a year earlier, the least since
September 2009, separate data showed.  “There are concerns about yesterday’s data indicating an
economic slowdown,” said Saktiandi Supaat, head of foreign-
exchange research at Malayan Banking Bhd. in  Singapore . “With
these numbers, there is a small possibility that the central
bank may cut  interest rates  this month.”  The rupiah slipped 0.9 percent to 9,159 per dollar as of
3:15 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency dropped 0.6 percent in 2011.  Consumer prices rose 3.79 percent last month from a year
earlier after increasing 4.15 percent in November.  Bank  Indonesia  Governor Darmin Nasution left the nation’s
benchmark interest rate unchanged at 6 percent last month.  The yield on the government’s benchmark 8.25 percent notes
due July 2021 fell 10 basis points, or 0.1 percentage point, to
6.02 percent today, according to the midday prices by Inter-
Dealer Market Association. The rate dropped 173 basis points
last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
