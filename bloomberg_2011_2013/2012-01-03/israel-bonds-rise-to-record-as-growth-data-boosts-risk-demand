Israel ’s benchmark government bonds
climbed for a fifth day, pushing the yield to the lowest level
since they were issued in April, as improved manufacturing
output around the world boosted demand for riskier assets.  The yield on the 5.5 percent bonds due in January 2022
dropped two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 4.47
percent, at 1:51 p.m. in Tel Aviv. The  Bank of Israel  today sold
11 billion shekels ($2.88 billion) of short-term Makam bills at
average yields below the previous sale. The shekel gained for
the first time in three days, increasing 0.3 percent to 3.8084 a
dollar as the greenback weakened against all 16 major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  Australian manufacturing expanded for the first time in six
months in December, an industry survey showed, adding to
evidence the global economy is improving after German and
Chinese factory output reports beat economist estimates in the
past two days. Data later today may show U.S. manufacturing rose
at the fastest pace in six months in December, according to a
survey of economists’ forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.  “Positive sentiment surrounding global economies is
contributing to a decline in the risk premium of Israeli assets
and boosting appetite for higher-yielding assets,” said Ehud Itzhakov, a bond trader at Bank Hapoalim Ltd. in  Tel Aviv .
“Institutional investors are looking for buying opportunities
in the market after two weeks that the  Finance Ministry  hasn’t
had a bond auction.”  Makam Sale  The Finance Ministry last sold bonds on Dec. 19 and its
first scheduled sale of 2012 will be Jan. 9 when it plans to
auction 1.5 billion shekels of debt, including the government’s
first 30-year bond.  The Bank of Israel today sold 2 billion shekels of 91-day
short-term notes, or Makam bills, at an average yield of 2.58
percent and 9 billion shekels of 364-day bills at an average
yield of 2.51 percent. That compares with respective average
yields of 2.7 percent and 2.8 percent, at the last auction of
similar-maturity securities on Dec. 6.  The yield on the inflation-linked bonds due June 2013
declined for a third day, falling four basis points to 0.64
percent. The two-year break-even rate, the difference between
inflation-linked bonds and similar-maturity fixed-rate
government debt, dropped three basis points to 191, implying an
average annual inflation rate of 1.91 percent.  Two-year interest-rate swaps (ISSW2) , an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period, retreated four basis
points to 2.48 percent. The central bank on Dec. 26 left the
benchmark  interest rate  unchanged at 2.75 percent, after
reducing it twice in three months, saying it wants to be able to
react to future developments.  The  Tel-Bond 40 Index (TEL-B40)  of corporate bonds rose for an eighth
day, gaining 0.3 percent to 261.13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
