LG Electronics Inc. (066570)  said it may start
selling the world’s largest television using the organic light-
emitting diode, or OLED, technology in the second half of this
year as it seeks to give a boost to stagnating TV sales.  LG, the world’s  second-largest (066570)  TV maker, will unveil the
model with a 55-inch screen at the  Consumer Electronics Show  in
 Las Vegas  next week, Ken Hong, a Seoul-based spokesman for the
company, said by telephone today.  The new display technology produces sharper images than
liquid-crystal display panels, and allows TVs to become thinner
in designs. Global shipments of LCD TVs may have reached 206
million units last year, falling short of an earlier projection
of 211 million units, researcher DisplaySearch said in October.  LG’s 55-inch OLED model is 4 millimeters thick, and weighs
7.5 kilograms, according to the company. It will also feature 3-
D functions and Web-based services, Hong said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
