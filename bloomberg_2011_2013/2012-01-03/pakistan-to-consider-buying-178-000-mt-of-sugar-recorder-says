Pakistan ,  Asia ’s third-biggest
consumer of sugar, may take a decision on the purchase of
178,000 tons of sugar from local mills when the country’s
finance committee meets today, the Business Recorder newspaper
 reported .  The proposal has been sent by the state-run Trading Corp.,
the newspaper said, citing government officials it didn’t
identify. Pakistan is seeking to buy as much as 200,000 tons to
build reserve stockpiles. The agency has already accepted bids
from two mills to supply 10,000 tons each, on Dec. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
