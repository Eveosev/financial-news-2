Gazprombank OJSC (GZPR)  unit Prima Energy
Trading LLC plans to acquire 26 percent of  Avrasya Gaz AS , a
Turkish wholesale gas trader, according to Turkey’s antitrust
watchdog and the owner of the holding Ozcan Tahincioglu.  Prima Energy on Dec. 8 applied for approval to acquire the
stake from Tahincioglu, the regulator said on its  website . He
declined to comment on the value of the deal or the timing of
the proposed transaction when contacted by telephone today,
saying  Russia ’s Gazprombank owns 100 percent of Prima Energy.  Turkey’s state pipeline operator Botas Boru Hatlari ile
Petrol Tasima AS awarded Avrasya Gaz a contract to import 500
million cubic meters of gas a year from OAO Gazprom from April
2009 to 2022 to sell in  Turkey , according to its website.  Gazprombank officials didn’t answer telephone calls to the
company’s offices today, a public holiday in Russia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
