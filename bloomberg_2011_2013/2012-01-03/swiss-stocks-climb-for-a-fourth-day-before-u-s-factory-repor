Swiss stocks (SMI)  rose to their highest
level since July after a U.S. report showed that manufacturing
in the world’s largest economy expanded in December at the
fastest pace in six months.  Health-care companies led gains, with  Roche Holding AG (ROG) 
climbing 1.7 percent.  Adecco SA (ADEN)  jumped 5 percent after agreeing
to buy Japan’s VSN Inc., a staffing-services company.  UBS AG (UBSN)  and
 Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , Switzerland’s largest lenders, added at
least 3.1 percent.  The Swiss Market Index, a measure of the biggest and most
actively traded companies, advanced 1.9 percent to 6,050.93 at
the close in Zurich, the highest level since July 11. The market
was closed yesterday for a holiday. The gauge dropped 7.8
percent in 2011,  led by banks (SMI) , as UBS retreated 27 percent and
Credit Suisse plunged 41 percent. The broader Swiss Performance
Index gained 2 percent today.  “The  U.S. economy  has the potential to surprise positively
if one considers that the markets have already priced in a lot
of the negative,” said Stefan Angele, head of  investment
management  at Swiss & Global Asset Management Ltd. in Zurich.
“However, I assume it’s still too early for euphoria. The
unsolved problems of the European debt crisis and the resulting
uncertainties in the financial system will likely weigh upon the
market.”  U.S. Economy  European stocks climbed in the last week of 2011 as reports
showed the recovery in the U.S. is gathering pace and as
optimism grew that policy makers will contain the debt crisis.
The second straight week of gains helped trim the benchmark
Stoxx Europe 600 Index’s loss last year to 11 percent.  In the U.S., a report today showed that manufacturing in
the largest economy expanded last month at the fastest pace
since June.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s  factory index (NAPMPMI)  rose to
53.9 last month from 52.7 in November. The median projection of
63 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for an increase
to 53.5. Fifty is the dividing line between growth and
contraction. Construction spending increased 1.2 percent in
November, beating estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Swiss manufacturing (SZPUI)  output unexpectedly expanded in
December, suggesting the economy is weathering cooling export
demand. The Procure.ch Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to 50.7
from 44.8 in November when adjusted for seasonal swings, Credit
Suisse said today. That’s the first reading above 50, indicating
expansion, since August. Economists forecast a gain to 45.4 in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Fiscal Rulebook  European leaders have pledged to draft a stricter rulebook
for controlling  government spending . German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy will meet in Berlin
on Jan. 9 to work out the details.  Roche, the world’s biggest maker of cancer drugs, rose 1.7
percent to 161.90 Swiss francs and  Novartis AG (NOVN)  added 1.3 percent
to 54.40 francs. The two companies, which make up about 35
percent of the SMI, were among the stocks that contributed the
most to its increase today.  Actelion Ltd. (ATLN) , Switzerland’s largest
biotechnology company, gained 4.7 percent to 33.76 francs.  Adecco, the world’s biggest supplier of temporary workers,
rallied 5 percent to 41.30 francs after saying it agreed to buy
VSN at an enterprise value of 90 million euros ($118 million).  UBS and Credit Suisse advanced 3.1 percent to 11.53 francs
and 3.5 percent to 22.85 francs, respectively.  Swatch Group AG (UHR) , the world’s biggest watchmaker, increased
3.6 percent to 364.10 francs. Cie. Financiere Richemont SA,
owner of the Cartier brand, gained 4.5 percent to 49.66 francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
