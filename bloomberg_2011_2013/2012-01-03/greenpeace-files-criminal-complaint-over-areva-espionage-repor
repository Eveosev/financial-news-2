Greenpeace International filed a
criminal complaint over a French news report that  Areva SA (CEI) , the
world’s biggest supplier of nuclear fuel and services, had the
environmental activist group spied on.  Spies may have infiltrated three watchdog groups, including
Greenpeace, at Areva’s request, according to a Jan. 1 report in
the Journal du Dimanche, prompting Greenpeace France to ask the
Paris prosecutors to order an investigation today, Adelaide
Colin, a Greenpeace France spokeswoman, said by phone.  “We learned of this affair in the press and want all
possible light shed on this possible spying operation,” Colin
said in a  statement  about the complaint, which didn’t name Areva
as a target.  Greenpeace won damages in a criminal case last year against
 Electricite de France SA (EDF)  over charges  Europe ’s biggest power
producer hired private investigators to spy on the group’s anti-
nuclear activities.  Areva said that it hasn’t spied on Greenpeace.  “There has never been an investigation request into
Greenpeace,” said Patricia Marie, a spokeswoman for Paris-based
Areva.  Greenpeace opposes France’s reliance on nuclear energy,
which produces more than three-quarters of the country’s power.
The country’s nuclear industry has been scrutinized in the
aftermath of  Japan ’s Fukushima atomic disaster, and French
Greenpeace activists last month broke into two atomic plants
operated by EDF to expose security lapses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
