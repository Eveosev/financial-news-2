Registered unemployment (SPUECHNG)  in  Spain ,
where almost half of young people are out of work, rose for a
fifth month in December as the euro area’s fourth-largest
economy contracted.  The number of people registering for  unemployment benefits 
rose 1,897 to 4.42 million, the Labor Ministry in Madrid said in
an e-mailed statement today. In November, it surged 59,536.  Spain’s economy contracted in the final months of the year
as tourism and exports, the drivers of its first-half recovery
from a three-year slump, weakened, the Bank of Spain said on
Dec. 29. Labor Minister Fatima Banez met union leaders and
employers last week. Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  asked both
sides to reach agreement by around Jan. 6 on changes to
collective wage-bargaining rules and ways to resolve labor
conflicts outside the courts.  “The data confirm the deterioration of the economic
situation in the last half of 2011,” State Secretary for
Employment Engracia Hidalgo told a news conference in  Madrid .
The report also showed the failure of the labor-market overhaul
implemented by the previous Socialist government, she said.  Available data also show Spain’s social-security system
won’t post a surplus in 2011, contrary to the previous
government’s forecast, the state secretary for social security,
Tomas Burgos, said at the same event.  To contact the reporter on this story:
