U.S. coal producers including  Peabody
Energy Corp. (BTU)  and  Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR)  rose after a
federal court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency
must delay implementing air-pollution regulations.  Peabody, the largest U.S. coal-mining company, rose 9.5 to
$36.27, the biggest gain in a month, while Alpha climbed 8
percent.  James River Coal Co. (JRCC) , which operates mines in Kentucky,
rose 11 percent, while  Patriot Coal Corp. (PCX)  advanced 7.8 percent.  The U.S. Appeals Court in Washington late on Dec. 30
granted a request by electric power producers and other
challengers to delay the deadline for some plants to start
reducing some polluting emissions.  The EPA’s Cross-State Air Pollution Rule seeks to impose
caps on sulfur dioxide, which can lead to acid rain, and
nitrogen dioxide, a component of smog, in  Texas  and 26 eastern
states.  To contact the reporter on this story:
