German  unemployment (GRUECHNG)  fell more than
forecast in December as exports of cars and machinery boomed and
one of the mildest winters on record helped support jobs in
construction.  The number of people out of work fell a seasonally adjusted
22,000 to 2.89 million, the Nuremberg-based Federal Labor Agency
said today. Economists forecast a decline of 10,000, the median
of 20 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed. The adjusted
 jobless rate (GRUEPR)  dropped to 6.8 percent.  German companies, working off orders for exports and
investment goods, have so far defied a debt crisis the European
Commission says risks triggering a recession in the euro area.
The Munich-based Ifo institute’s measure of business confidence
rose unexpectedly in December, and polls show most Germans see
their job as secure even as  Europe ’s biggest economy slows.  “Forward-looking indicators including Ifo underscore that
the German jobs motor is fundamentally intact,” said Johannes Mayr, a senior economist at  Bayerische Landesbank  in Munich.  The euro rose 0.7 percent to $1.3028 as of 1:53 p.m. in
Berlin. The benchmark DAX index gained 0.6 percent.  Audi, Airbus  Carmaker  Audi AG (NSU)  said on Dec. 27 that it may add 1,200 jobs
this year as it expands investment in electric vehicles and
light-metal technology.  Airbus SAS (EAD) , maker of the A380 superjumbo
whose German production sites include Hamburg, said Dec. 14 that
it’s seeking 4,000 more workers. Of Hamburg’s largest 200
employers, 42 percent said they plan to boost hiring in 2012,
the Abendblatt newspaper reported Dec. 30, citing its own poll.  With the exception of a 6,000 increase in October, German
unemployment has now fallen in every month since June 2009. The
average jobless total in unadjusted terms for 2011 squeezed
below the 3 million mark at 2.97 million, the lowest since 1991,
Labor Agency head Frank-Juergen Weise said.  “German unemployment mastered the dual impact of the debt
crisis and weakening economic growth in 2011 but these risks
remain, accompanying us as we enter the new year,” Weise told
reporters in Nuremberg.  The jobs market also benefited from what the DWD weather
bureau said were the fifth-warmest average national temperatures
in December since 1881. That enabled German building companies,
which normally shed as many as 150,000 staff most winters, to
keep workers on sites, Harald Schroeer, the deputy managing
director of the ZDB construction group, said in an interview.  Job Security   Across  Germany , 90 percent of voters said they view their
jobs as secure, a poll of 2,000 respondents by Ernst & Young
International for Die Welt newspaper published today showed.
Forty percent said they expect the economy to weaken in 2012.  German exports of cars, machines and services breached the
1 trillion euro mark ($1.3 trillion) for the first time in 2011,
according the BGA export group. Yet continued export growth,
which may be half the 12 percent reported in 2011, depends on
the euro region solving its debt crisis in a “sustainable”
way, the BGA said on Dec. 30.  Germany may depend on demand from  China  this year as budget
cuts and belt-tightening causes sales to ebb to Germany’s
European partners, the destination for 60 percent of its
exports, University of California Berkeley economist  Barry Eichengreen  said in a Dec. 30 interview published in the
Financial Times Deutschland.  Forecasts Slashed  Ifo and the Bundesbank both slashed their forecasts last
month for 2012 economic growth in Germany as a result of the
debt crisis on Germany’s main euro-area trading partners, to 0.4
percent from 2.3 percent and to 0.6 percent from 1.8 percent
respectively. Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s government estimates
that the economy grew 2.9 percent in 2011.  For now, lower unemployment is boosting  consumer spending ,
helping drive domestic demand,  Mario Gruppe , an economist at
NordLB in Hanover, said by phone.  “Germany won’t be able to avoid an economic cooling down,
so there will also be effect on the labor market,” he said.
“But we saw in the last crisis that the German labor market
held up astounding well in global competitiveness, so the
effects could be negligible.”  Germany’s adjusted jobless rate was 5.5 percent in October,
according to the latest harmonized Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development figures. That compared with 9.8
percent in  France , 8.5 percent in  Italy  and a European Union
average of 9.6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
