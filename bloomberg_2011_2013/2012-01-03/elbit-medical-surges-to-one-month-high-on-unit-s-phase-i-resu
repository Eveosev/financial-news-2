  Elbit Medical Technologies Ltd. (EMTC) 
advanced to the highest in almost a month after a unit reported
that a Phase I clinical trial of a system for the treatment of
essential tremor produced improvements in patients.  The  shares (EMTC)  of Elbit, which owns interests in companies that
manufacture medical devices, surged 8.4 percent to 0.272 shekel,
the highest level since Dec. 7, at 10:59 a.m. in Tel Aviv.  The unit completed the trial using the ExAblate 4000 system
for the treatment of essential tremor, a nervous system disorder
that causes rhythmic shaking. The test showed that most of the
patients treated with the system registered “significant
improvement” in tremors without any side effects, the company
said in a filing to the  Tel Aviv  Stock Exchange today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
