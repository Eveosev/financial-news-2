Details from 15,000 Israeli credit
card customers have been exposed by hackers on the Internet, the
 Bank of Israel  said.  The cards have been blocked from further use in Internet or
telephone transactions and cardholders won’t be liable for their
misuse as a result of the leak, the central bank said today in
an e-mailed statement. The cards, which were issued by  Israel 
Credit Cards Ltd., Isracard Ltd. and Leumi Card Ltd., will be
replaced, the central bank said.  “Details of credit card customers were recently exposed on
the Internet, as a result of hackers breaking into the websites
of companies which maintained that information,” the central
bank said. “Any problem should be reported to the credit card
companies as soon as possible.”  Israel’s  Army Radio  reported early today that a group of
computer hackers claiming to be of Saudi Arabian origin had
taken credit for exposing the information in a statement they
posted on an Israeli sports website. The hackers broke into the
websites of companies that maintained the information, the
central bank said.  Dov Kotler, chief executive officer of Tel Aviv-based
Isracard, said that details from about 6,600 cards of the 3.3
million issued by the company were exposed on the Internet.  “The company invests heavily every year to prevent misuse
of its cards, and will continue to do so,” Kotler said in an e-
mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
