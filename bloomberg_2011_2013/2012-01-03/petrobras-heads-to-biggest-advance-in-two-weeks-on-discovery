Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) ,  Brazil ’s
state-controlled oil company, gained the most in two weeks after
saying it found crude and natural gas of “excellent quality”
in a field off the country’s southeastern coast.  Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based company is known,
rose 3.9 percent to 22.41 reais at the close of trading in Sao
Paulo, the steepest one-day gain since Dec. 20. The benchmark
Bovespa index climbed 2.5 percent.  The discovery was at the Tambuata well in the Golfinho
field, off the coast of Espirito Santo state, according to a
regulatory filing.  Finding more crude and natural gas at the site “allows the
company to expand its output in the field using the
infrastructure it already has in place,” Leonardo Zanfelicio
and Karina Freitas, analysts at Sao Paulo-based brokerage
Concordia SA, wrote in a note to clients today.  Petrobras also said in a statement on Dec. 29 that an oil
and gas deposit in Brazil’s Guara area was commercially viable.
The area has an estimated 2.1 billion barrels of recoverable oil
equivalent, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
