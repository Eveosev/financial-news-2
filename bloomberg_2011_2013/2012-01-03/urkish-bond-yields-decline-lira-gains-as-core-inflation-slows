Turkish yields dropped for the first
time in three days and the lira strengthened as  core inflation 
slowed in December.  Yields on the two-year benchmark note fell six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 11.42 percent at 10:51
a.m., according to the RBS Istanbul Benchmark Bond Index. The
lira appreciated 0.3 percent to 1.8896 per dollar.  Core inflation declined to 8.1 percent last month from 8.2
percent in November, the statistics agency in Ankara said on its
website today.  “I see core inflation as a positive development,”  Tatha Ghose , senior emerging market economist at Commerzbank AG in
 London , said in e-mailed comments. “The stabilization in core-
CPI will likely be the development the markets talk about until
the next release and this is positive at the margin.”  The headline  inflation (TUCPIY)  rate rose to the highest in three
years to 10.5 percent in December from 9.5 percent in the
previous month, the agency said. It remains above the year-end
target of 5.5 percent and topped the 10.1 percent median
estimate of seven economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Inflation has surged from 4.3 percent in April. Central
bank Governor Erdem Basci is pursuing a flexible monetary policy
to help manage volatile capital flows. Basci said yesterday the
bank applied “additional tightening” last week after the lira
fell to a record low against the dollar, extending its drop to
18 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
