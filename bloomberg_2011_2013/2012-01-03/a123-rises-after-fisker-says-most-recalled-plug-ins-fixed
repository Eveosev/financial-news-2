A123 Systems Inc. (AONE) , a maker of
lithium-ion batteries for rechargeable vehicles, rose 22 percent
after Fisker Automotive Inc. said most plug-in electric sports
cars using A123 packs already have been fixed.  A123, based in Waltham, Massachusetts, gained 35 cents to
$1.96 at the close in  New York , after reaching an intraday high
of $2.10.  Fisker, a closely held carmaker based in Anaheim,
 California , on Dec. 29 recalled 239 units of its luxury Karma
sedan to fix a hose clamp in the A123 battery pack at risk of
leaking coolant, potentially causing a fire. Repairs or
inspections have been completed and “a majority” of cars are
back in service after getting new packs, Fisker said yesterday.  “We decided that the immediate replacement of the battery
pack in every vehicle was the right approach for all our
customers,”  Henrik Fisker , Fisker Automotive’s chief executive
officer, said in a statement on the company’s website. “We
identified the appropriate fix, made our retailers aware of the
situation and began contacting all our customers within 48
hours.”  Fisker, whose Karma sedan retails for $102,000, had sent
225 of the cars to dealers and had 1,200 “in the pipeline,”
Henrik Fisker said in a Dec. 21 interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
