India ’s market regulator allowed
company owners to auction their stakes to investors instead of
selling shares in public offerings, according to an official
from the regulator.  The  Securities & Exchange Board of India  approved the plan
at its board meeting in Mumbai today, said the official, who
declined to be identified before a public announcement. The
board also approved changes to rules to allow companies to buy
back shares from founders, the official said.  The decisions by the regulator is expected to help Finance
Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  meet the 400-billion rupee asset sale
target for the fiscal year ending in March. Last year’s slide in
stocks forced him to delay selling shares of Oil & Natural Gas
Corp., Steel Authority of India Ltd. and Indian Oil Corp.  “The government could reduce the budget gap by selling
shares of state-owned companies through open auction, while
financial institutions may get better prices,” said R.K. Gupta,
managing director at Taurus Asset Management Ltd., which manages
46 billion rupees of assets, said from  New Delhi  today.
“Promoters will save on costs and hassles by avoiding public
offerings.”  N. Hariharan, a spokesman at Sebi, didn’t respond to a text
message sent to his mobile phone and an e-mail.  -- Editor: Ravil Shirodkar  To contact the reporter on this story:
