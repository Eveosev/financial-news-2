Heating oil rose after  China ’s
manufacturing activity expanded, indicating fuel demand may
increase, and the U.S. currency weakened, boosting the appeal of
commodities as an investment.  Futures gained as much as 3.7 percent as China’s purchasing
managers’ index climbed to 50.3 in December from 49 in November,
the Beijing-based logistics federation said Jan. 1. A number
above 50 indicates expansion. The dollar fell as much as 1
percent against the euro.  “There’s been good Chinese and Indian manufacturing data”
supporting oil and products, said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and
broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . A weaker
dollar is also a factor in stronger prices, he said.  February-delivery heating oil gained 9.92 cents, or 3.4
percent, to $3.0134 a gallon at 10 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices touched $3.0186, the highest
intraday level since Dec. 8.  There are also concerns about the impending closure of some
of the Atlantic Basin refineries, McGillian said. French workers
at  Petroplus Holdings AG (PPHN) ’s Petit Couronne refinery in Normandy
are continuing to block deliveries of fuel products in a protest
against a decision to halt the plant.  Nicolas Vincent, a spokesman for the CGT union, said there
will be a meeting tomorrow with other unions to discuss widening
the strike to other plants. Petroplus is in the process of
shutting units at the 161,800-barrel-a-day Petit Couronne
refinery today, he said.  Gasoline for February delivery rose 6.85 cents, or 2.6
percent, to $2.7259 a gallon.  Regular gasoline (3AGSREG)  at the pump, averaged nationwide, held at
$3.279 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data. Prices are 6.7
percent above a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
