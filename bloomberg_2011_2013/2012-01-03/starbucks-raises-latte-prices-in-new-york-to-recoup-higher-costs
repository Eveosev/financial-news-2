Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) , the world’s biggest
coffee shop operator, raised prices on certain beverages in the
U.S. Northeast, South and Southwest to recoup higher costs.  In markets such as  New York  City, the price of tall brewed
coffees and tall lattes increased by 10 cents, while the price
for grande brewed coffees stayed the same, Jim Olson, a company
spokesman, said today in an e-mail. The changes are the result
of “the cost of doing business,” which includes distribution,
materials and commodities, he said.  Starbucks, along with other restaurants, has grappled with
higher raw ingredient costs during the past year. In November,
Seattle-based Starbucks raised prices at cafes in the Pacific
Northwest, Midwest and  Southern California  to help recoup higher
commodity and rent costs.  Along with New York, today’s price increase includes the
Atlanta, Dallas and Albuquerque,  New Mexico , markets, Olson
said.  Rising commodity costs, primarily for coffee beans,
narrowed profit by 7 cents a share in the quarter ended Oct. 2,
the company said in a statement on Nov. 3.  Starbucks, which has about 10,800 stores in the U.S.,
dropped 1.6 percent to $45.29 at the close in New York. The
shares gained 43 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
