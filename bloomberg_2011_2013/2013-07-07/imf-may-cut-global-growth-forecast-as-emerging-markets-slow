The International Monetary Fund may
cut its global growth forecast because the expansion of emerging
market economies is slowing, Managing Director Christine Lagarde
said.  The Washington-based fund predicted in April that the world
economy would expand 3.3 percent this year.  “I fear, given what we’re seeing in particular in emerging
countries, not the developing and low-income countries but
emerging countries, that we will be slightly below that,”
Lagarde told a conference in Aix-en-Provence,  France .  The IMF is scheduled to publish new forecasts later this
week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
