A mayor and Communist Party chief
were fired after 121 people died in  China ’s deadliest blaze in
13 years, in the northeastern province of Jilin, as the
government cracks down on industrial safety.  Vice Governors Gu Chunli and Huang Guanchun, also
provincial police chief, are among 73 officials penalized over
two workplace accidents that killed more than 150 people this
year in Jilin, Xinhua News Agency  reported  today. A further 35
people will be prosecuted over the safety lapses, Xinhua said.  The State Council ordered the province to strictly
implement workplace safety responsibility mechanisms and “make
it an impassable red line that development can’t come at the
cost of human lives,” according to Xinhua.  The June 3 fire at a poultry plant in the city of Dehui
caused 182 million  yuan  ($30 million) in direct economic losses.
A March 29 blast at Tonghua Mining Group’s Babao coal mine
killed 36 people, Xinhua said.  Dehui’s Party Secretary Zhang Dexiang and Mayor Liu
Changchun were removed from their posts, while Tonghua Mining’s
Chairman Zhao Xianwen and 15 other company executives were
handed over for prosecution, Xinhua reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
