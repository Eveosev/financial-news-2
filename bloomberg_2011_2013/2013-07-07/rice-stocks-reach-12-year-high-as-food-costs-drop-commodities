Rice stockpiles  are expanding to the
highest level in 12 years as production increases to a record,
adding to a worldwide surge in agricultural output that is
poised to diminish the $1.1 trillion global food-import bill.  Reserves will gain for a seventh year, rising 2.7 percent
to 108.6 million metric tons in 2013-2014, the U.S. Department
of Agriculture estimates. Output will climb 1.9 percent to 479.2
million tons, exceeding demand by 2.8 million tons. Prices for
5-percent broken Thai white rice, an  Asian benchmark , will drop
13 percent to $455 a ton by December, according to the median of
eight trader and analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Combined global output of rice, corn, soybeans and wheat
will advance to a record as fields in the U.S. and  Europe 
recover from droughts last year, according to the USDA. Wheat,
corn and soybeans are already in bear markets, contributing to
two consecutive months of declining world food costs tracked by
the  United Nations . Inventories of rice, the staple for half the
world, are now equal to almost three years of annual trade.  “The stocks are so big, I don’t think anyone can talk
about a bottom in prices,” said Geneva-based Mamadou Ciss, the
president of Alliance Commodities SA, who has traded rice for
almost three decades. “There is oversupply for sure in the
world. The crops are pretty good everywhere.”  The Thai grade fell 10 percent to $524 a ton this year as
the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Agriculture Spot Index of eight
commodities retreated 15 percent. The MSCI All-Country World
Index of equities advanced 5.9 percent, and a Bank of America
Corp. index shows Treasuries lost 3.5 percent.  Global Inventories  Expanding  rice production  and stockpiles mean less demand
for imports, which the UN’s Food & Agriculture Organization in
 Rome  estimates will drop to 37.6 million tons, contracting for
the first time in four years. Global inventories expanded 44
percent since 2006-2007, USDA data show.  Government subsidies are encouraging more production even
as prices decline and inventories expand.  Thailand , once the
biggest exporter, spent 588.7 billion baht ($18.9 billion)
stockpiling 27 million tons of milled rice since October 2011
under a policy that paid farmers as much as 50 percent more than
local prices. Domestic output will expand 4.5 percent to 21.1
million tons in 2013-2014, the USDA estimates.  Thailand lost about 137 billion baht through the buying
program in the last crop year, according to a government
estimate, and Moody’s Investors Service said last month the
policy is undermining efforts to balance the budget by 2017. The
government kept the purchase price at 15,000 baht a ton this
month, reversing a proposal to lower it to 12,000 baht, and said
that it would keep selling from stockpiles.  Exporters Association  India , last year’s largest exporter, increased the minimum
price it pays farmers to a record. That will mean a 6 percent
drop in shipments to 9.5 million tons in the 12 months to March
31, according to Vijay Setia, a former president and member of
the All India Rice Exporters Association. The USDA says Indian
output will rise 3.8 percent to a record 108 million tons.  Increasing Asian production will be partially offset by
less supply in the U.S., the fourth-biggest shipper. The
nation’s output will drop 4.7 percent to a two-year low of 6.04
million tons, reducing reserves to the smallest since 2009, the
USDA predicts. Rough-rice futures on the Chicago Board of Trade
are up 1.8 percent at $14.805 per 100 pounds since reaching an
eight-month closing low of $14.54 in March.  Toxic Metal  China , the biggest consumer and importer, will buy a  record 
3 million tons, according to the USDA. The country is buying
more because it costs less than domestic supply, the USDA’s
Economic Research Service unit said in a  report  June 14. The
discovery of cadmium, a toxic metal, in some rice from southern
China also boosted external demand, according to Beijing Orient
Agribusiness Consultant Ltd., a grain research company.  Global demand for imports is contracting, according to the
FAO. Purchases by  Nigeria , the largest buyer last year, will
drop 10 percent to 2.7 million tons. Imports by  Indonesia , the
third-biggest, will slide 28 percent.  “It’s a buyers’ market with ample supplies of rice and
other grains around the globe,” said Kiattisak Kanlayasirivat,
a Bangkok-based director with Novel Commodities SA, which trades
about $600 million of rice a year.  Global production of wheat will be the second-biggest on
record, rising 6.1 percent to 696 million tons, the USDA
estimates. Farmers will reap the most soybeans and corn in
history. Combined output of those three crops and rice will
expand 7.7 percent to 2.42 billion tons, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg from USDA predictions.  Wheat Planting  U.S. farmers, the biggest agricultural producers, planted
the most corn since 1936 this year after prices advanced to a
record in August. The nation’s wheat acreage reached a four-year
high and growers sowed the most soybeans ever.  The FAO’s index of  world food prices  fell 0.9 percent in
June, with the cereals gauge declining for the eighth time in
nine months. Costs are 11 percent below the all-time high
reached in February 2011. The UN body is anticipating a global
food import bill of $1.1 trillion this year, 13 percent less
than the record $1.26 trillion reached in 2011.  “The supply estimates for grains are quiet staggering,”
 Abah Ofon , an agricultural analyst at Standard Chartered Plc in
 Singapore . “A lot of end users are sitting on the sidelines,
waiting for prices to fall further or at least bottom.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
