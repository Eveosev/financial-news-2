Bluewater Bio International, a
London-based wastewater-treatment company, said it completed the
first phase of commissioning of a sewage plant upgrade in
Bahrain, the largest of its kind in the Gulf region.  The $20 million project awarded by the Ministry of Works at
Tubli Water Pollution Control Centre, meant to alleviate
wastewater overloads at the plant, received flows for the first
time with full completion expected in October, Bluewater Bio
said today in a statement. Plant capacity, designed for 200,000
cubic meters a day, exceeds 300,000 cubic meters daily due
growth and urbanization in the kingdom, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
