Andy Murray  took a one-set lead over
top seed Novak Djokovic in the Wimbledon men’s single final as
he tries to become the first British male to win the title at
the All England Club in 77 years.  Murray took the set 6-4 on Centre Court in southwest
 London .  In the first game, Murray won three straight points on
Djokovic’s serve, but the Serb was able to get them back and won
the game when Murray dumped two shots into the net.  Murray jumped out 40-love on his opening serve and won with
an ace down the center. The British No. 1 got a break through in
the third match on his fourth break point, hitting behind the
Serb as he ran across court.  Djokovic, 26, broke back in the next game to even the match
at 2-2, and then held. Murray won the next two games at love to
take a 4-3 lead, then was able to come back from several break
points to hold.  The Serb came back from love-30 to take the next game to
make it 5-4 to Murray, who then held to win the set.  The 26-year-old Dunblane, Scotland-born Murray is trying to
become the first British man to take the singles title on the
London grass courts since  Fred Perry , who won Wimbledon in 1936
during the short reign of Edward VIII, Queen Elizabeth II’s
uncle. Perry’s statue stands next to Centre Court.  Virginia Wade 
was the last Briton to clinch the women’s title, in 1977.  Djokovic is going for his seventh Grand Slam title and
second Wimbledon championship after his victory in 2011. A win
today will tie him with  John McEnroe  of the U.S. and  Sweden ’s
Mats Wilander in eighth place for the most major titles for a
man since 1968, when the sport went professional.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
