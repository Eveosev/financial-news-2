Chargemaster Plc, a U.K. producer of
charging systems for electric vehicles, is seeking to raise 6
million pounds ($8.9 million) to meet growing demand through an
initial public offering on London’s Alternative Investment
Market.  Chargemaster expects to start trading this month, David Martell, chief executive officer of the Luton, U.K.-based
company, said in a statement today.  Chargemaster plans to use the funds to exploit the growing
market for electric vehicles as governments in the U.K. and
elsewhere in  Europe  set policies to spur wider use. It has
provided gear for more than 6,000 charging points since 2008.  “The demand is being driven by automotive manufacturers
producing a growing range of new plug-in cars required to meet
regulatory emission targets, the U.K. government’s recent
commitment  to provide  37 million pounds of funding for charging
infrastructure, as well as other governments’ commitment to
encouraging the uptake of environmentally cleaner vehicles,”
Martell said in the statement.  The European Commission in January said it’s aiming to
install 795,000 charging points across the region by 2020 and
the U.K. has set a goal of 122,000 over the same period,
Chargemaster said in the statement. The U.K. has committed 400
million pounds to support low-emission vehicles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
