New York Yankees shortstop  Derek Jeter  went 0-for-2 with a walk in his first minor league 
rehabilitation game since breaking his ankle, while third 
baseman  Alex Rodriguez  got his first hit in three games.  Jeter played five innings last night with the Triple-A
Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders for the first time since Oct.
13, when he broke his left ankle in the American League
Championship Series. He re-injured the ankle in spring training.  “I missed being around the team, I missed competing, I
missed playing,” Jeter told reporters. “So I’m happy that I’m
getting the opportunity to start playing again.”  Jeter, 39, started as shortstop in the RailRiders’ 4-2 win
against the Lehigh Valley IronPigs in Moosic,  Pennsylvania .  Rodriguez, who was hitless in his first four appearances in
two rehab games, was 1-for-2 last night with the Yankees’ Class
A Tampa minor-league team who beat the Brevard County Manatees
6-1 in Melbourne, Florida.  Rodriguez, 37, is recuperating from hip surgery in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
