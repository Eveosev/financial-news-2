Eight explosions rocked one of
Buddhism’s holiest sites in eastern  India , injuring two people
in what government officials say was a terrorist attack.  Four blasts shook the interior of the Mahabodhi temple
complex in Bodh Gaya in Bihar state this morning, while four
others occurred outside it, federal Home Secretary Anil Goswami
told reporters in remarks broadcast by the CNN-IBN television
channel. The temple structure wasn’t damaged, he said. “It was
a terror attack,” Goswami said.  Two people were injured in the blasts, federal Junior Home
Minister R. P. N. Singh said on CNN-IBN. The National
Investigation Agency will probe the incident, Bihar’s Chief
Minister Nitish Kumar told reporters in Bodh Gaya town,
according to the broadcaster.  India had been targeted 10 times by terrorists since
November 2008, when the government pledged to improve policing
and intelligence gathering after Pakistani gunmen killed 166
people during a three-day siege of Mumbai, the country’s
financial center. Explosions in the southern city of Bangalore
in April injured 16 people.  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Pranab Mukherjee condemned today’s incident.  “Our composite culture and traditions teach us respect for
all religions and such attacks on religious places will never be
tolerated,” the premier said in a statement in New Delhi.  India will investigate all aspects of the blast, including
who was responsible and their motive, Kumar said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
