The same equity analysts who lowered second-quarter profit growth predictions to almost nothing in 2013 are raising price forecasts, convinced the economy is growing fast enough to lure more investors and boost valuations.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index earnings rose 1.8 percent last quarter, down from a projection of 8.7 percent six months ago, according to more than 11,000 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. At the same time, share-price targets for companies from  GameStop Corp. (GME)  to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are rising at the fastest rate in two years. The U.S. equity gauge will increase 8.9 percent to a record 1,777.91 should the forecasts prove accurate.  Bulls say expectations for higher  valuations  show analysts share Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s view that the economy may gather enough momentum to expand on its own. Getting to their target would raise the index’s earnings multiple to 16.4, still about 12 percent lower than its 25-year average. Bears say price appreciation without profit gains shows the five-year bull market is fading and declines are inevitable. Second-quarter earnings season begins today.  “There’s a tight relationship between confidence and multiples,” Joseph Tanious, a New York-based global market strategist at JPMorgan Funds, which oversees $400 billion, said by telephone on July 3. “Confidence at these levels, while still depressed, is clearly rising,” he said. “You have an improving U.S. economy albeit at a slow pace.”  Earnings Season  Stocks advanced  last week , with the  S&P 500  climbing 1.6 percent to 1,631.89 after U.S. employers added 195,000 jobs in June and manufacturing rose more than forecast. While the index has fallen 2.2 percent since the May 21 record, it’s up 14 percent for 2013. The U.S. equity gauge climbed 0.5 percent to 1,640.46 in  New York  today.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the biggest U.S. aluminum producer, is the first Dow Jones Industrial Average company to report quarterly earnings today.  Even as the S&P 500  rallied  60 percent in the last three years, its price-earnings ratio remained below the long-term average of 18.6, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and S&P that begins in 1988. Valuations have held steady as  profit growth  matched gains in share prices since the  bull market  began in March 2009.  Reaching analyst price forecasts would send the S&P 500 more than 6.5 percent above the all-time high of 1,669.16 set May 21. Operating profits projected to reach a record $108.40 a share this year would give the index a valuation of 16.4, compared with 17.5 when the market peaked in October 2007.  Investor Sentiment  “If we were to say people were dipping their toe in the water on the economy a few years ago, now they are mid-thigh,” Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade Holding Corp., said in a July 5 phone interview from  Chicago . His firm has $499.3 billion in client assets. “There is every reason to believe that the multiples should also increase.”  After three years of growth, earnings increases are slowing. Income in the S&P 500 advanced an average of 4.3 percent in each of the last five quarters, compared to the 28 percent average for 2010 and 2011, Bloomberg data show.  “You will need a strong acceleration of earnings in the third and fourth quarters for the full-year estimates to come through,” Robert Royle, a manager at the North American Trust fund of Smith & Williamson Investment Management LLP, who helps oversee $21 billion in  London , said July 2. “You’ll have multiple expansion in an economy that’s not really growing fast enough.”  Slower Growth  U.S. gross domestic product will increase 1.9 percent this year, down from 2.2 percent in 2012, according to the median projection of 86 economists. The recovery since the 2009 recession is the slowest since World War II, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  While analysts say profits in the third and fourth quarters will rise 5.5 percent and 11.2 percent, respectively, their forecasts usually come down as the reporting season approaches. Since 2009, projections have  declined  6.2 percentage points in the six months leading up to a quarter’s end, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Lower expectations helped  about 73 percent  of the companies in the benchmark measure exceed forecasts by an average of 5.1 percent for the first three months of the year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. At the same time, 51 percent of companies reported sales that trailed estimates.  Lower Bar  Analysts are looking past profit growth this year and predicting  improving investor sentiment  will push stocks higher. They’ve boosted price estimates for the S&P 500 by 11 percent from 1,608.50 on Dec. 28, the fastest rate since July 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. equity volume, in retreat since 2009, is showing signs of picking up. Trading on all American markets has averaged 6.77 billion shares a day since the start of June, compared with 6.35 billion between January and May and 6.42 billion in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Shares of the three biggest public discount brokerages have rallied an average of 51 percent this year as individual investors buy and sell more equities. Daily average revenue-generating trades increased an average of 14 percent in May, compared to a year ago, according to data from Charles Schwab Corp., TD Ameritrade and E*Trade Financial Corp.  Economic Outlook  Economists are growing more optimistic after  consumer spending  rebounded in May, new home sales climbed more than estimated and durable goods orders beat forecasts. Growth estimates for the July-through-September period rose to 2.3 percent from 2.2 percent in May, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. U.S. gross domestic product will expand 2.7 percent next year, the most since 2006, estimates show.  The Fed may taper its bond purchases, or quantitative easing, if the  U.S. economy  improves in line with forecasts, Bernanke said June 19. The central bank has been buying $85 billion of bonds as part of an unprecedented stimulus plan after it cut  interest rates  near zero percent December 2008.  While the size of the S&P 500 rally since 2009 is comparable to the gain in the late 1990s during the Internet bubble, valuations are about half as high. Of the 500 companies in the index, 448 stocks trade lower than their price estimates, the most since December, Bloomberg data show.  Analysts boosted price estimates for GameStop 46 percent this year, even as they  slashed  second-quarter earnings estimates 80 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The largest video-game specialty retailer, based in Grapevine,  Texas , trades at 13.6 times earnings in the past year, or 23 percent less than its average over the last decade.  GameStop Price  “The share price completely looks through this year,” said  Michael Pachter , a Los Angeles-based research analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc., said during a July 3 phone interview. He rates the stock the equivalent of a buy and predicts computer game releases in 2014 will fuel gains. “They’re going to have a really big start of the year next year and that should be a big positive.”  Second-quarter profit estimates for  Goldman Sachs (GS)  have fallen 5.4 percent in 2013 yet forecasts for shares of the Wall Street bank have increased 21 percent. Shares  will rise  5.2 percent to $161.19 in the next year, bringing its price-earnings ratio to 11.2, or 7.1 percent higher than today.  Goldman Earnings  “I don’t really care what the company earns in the quarter,”  Richard Bove , a bank analyst with Rafferty Capital Markets LLC who estimates the stock will reach $185, said in a July 3 phone interview. “It would appear that in each one of Goldman’s core businesses, underwriting and trading, the outlook over the next couple of years is quite strong.”  Hess Corp. (HES) , the New York-based energy company, trades 10 percent below its decade-average multiple of 13. Hess will jump 18 percent to $80.21 in the next 12 months, up from an earlier forecast for $65.86, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. With  second-quarter earnings  estimates down 13 percent from six months ago, the price multiple would expand to 12.8, almost to the historic average.  “We are still going higher,” Phil Orlando, the New York-based chief equity strategist at Federated Investors, which has about $380 billion in assets under management, said by telephone on July 2. “We’re only halfway through the multiple expansion I would expect.”  To contact the reporters on this story: Inyoung Hwang in New York at  ihwang7@bloomberg.net ; Katie Brennan in New York at  kbrennan23@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at  lthomasson@bloomberg.net
