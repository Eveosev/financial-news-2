Abu Qatada , an Islamic cleric facing
terrorism charges in his home country of Jordan, was deported to
the Mideast nation today, U.K. Home Secretary Theresa May said
in a  statement  on the official government website.  “This dangerous man has now been removed from our shores
to face the courts in his own country,” May said in the
statement.  The British government failed in repeated attempts since
2001 to deport Qatada because of court rulings that evidence
linked to torture might be used against him in Jordan. Qatada,
whose real name is Mohammed Othman and who was 52 when he was
re-arrested in March, has been in and out of U.K. jails for more
than a decade.  The cleric, described by a judge in Spain as former al-Qaeda leader  Osama Bin Laden ’s right-hand man in  Europe , said in
May he would return voluntarily if Jordan ratified a treaty
promising him a fair trial. That took effect July 2.  In May, Qatada was denied bail by a London judge who called
him a threat to national security.  To contact the reporter on this story:
