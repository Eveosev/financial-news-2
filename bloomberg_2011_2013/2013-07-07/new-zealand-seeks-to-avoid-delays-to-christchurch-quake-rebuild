New Zealand ’s government wants to
ensure that the failure of the Christchurch City council to
properly process building permits doesn’t delay the recovery of
the city from devastating earthquakes.  The government will appoint its own manager after the
council was stripped of its accreditation to issue consents, and
other bodies are starting to take on some of Christchurch’s
work, Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson told
Television New Zealand’s Q+A today.  “We’re farming that work out to a range of other councils
so it doesn’t delay things,” he said. “We hope that we can
make sure it’s as seamless as possible.”  Christchurch faces a NZ$40 billion ($31 billion) rebuild of
homes, commercial buildings, roads and pipelines after quakes
that struck the nation’s third-biggest city in 2010-11.
Riskpool, the agency that provides the city with indemnity
insurance, withdrew its backing on July 5, adding to concern
that building and investment will grind to a halt.  “It’s a matter of restoring confidence really quickly,”
said Williamson.  It is unlikely any of the buildings approved under the
flawed process are unsafe, because the failings were related to
issues of documentation rather than structural integrity, he
said. He wouldn’t give an absolute commitment on that, nor
estimate how many properties were affected.  To contact the reporter on this story:
