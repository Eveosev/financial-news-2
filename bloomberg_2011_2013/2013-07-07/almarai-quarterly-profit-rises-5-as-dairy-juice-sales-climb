Almarai Co., (ALMARAI)  the Saudi food producer
operating a joint venture with  PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) , posted a 5 percent
increase in second-quarter profit as its dairy, juice and bakery
business grew.  Net income  rose to 398 million riyals ($106 million) from
380 million riyals a year earlier, the company said in a
 statement  to the Saudi stock exchange website today. That was
less than the 404 million-riyal average estimate of nine
analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Almarai,  Saudi Arabia ’s largest food producer, said in
April it raised 1.3 billion riyals ($347 million) from the
private placement of Islamic bonds with investors in the
kingdom. The sale was part of a 2.3 billion-riyal sukuk program
it set up last year. Almarai has a 15.7 billion-riyal, five-year
investment program to boost output and develop products.  Chief Financial Officer Paul-Louis Gay said in May the
company is considering tapping global debt markets in the next
12 months for about $500 million as it seeks to expand its
business in the U.S.,  Argentina  and Ukraine. The debt may be an
Islamic bond or a hybrid sukuk, he said.  Sales are expected to be “driven by the growth of poultry,
fruit juice and bakery segments,” Riyad Capital said in a
research report dated July 2. “We continue to believe 2013 to
be the year of poultry.”  The shares  have increased 14 percent this year compared
with an advance of 13 percent for Saudi Arabia’s benchmark
index. The stock rose 0.7 percent to 72.25 riyals, the highest
on a closing basis since February 2006, at 12:04 p.m. in  Riyadh .  To contact the reporter on this story:
