Art collector Charles Saatchi has
said he and chef Nigella Lawson are to divorce, the Mail on
Sunday reported, citing an interview.  “I am sorry to announce that Nigella Lawson and I are
getting divorced,” Saatchi told the newspaper. “This is
heartbreaking for both of us as our love was very deep, but in
the last year we have become estranged and drifted apart.”  Last month the newspaper The People published photographs
showing Saatchi with his hand around his wife’s neck at a London
restaurant table.  “I feel that I have clearly been a disappointment to
Nigella during the last year or so, and I am disappointed that
she was advised to make no public comment to explain that I
abhor violence of any kind against women and have never abused
her physically in any way,” Saatchi told the Mail.  The argument photographed at the restaurant “could equally
have been Nigella grasping my neck to hold my attention -- as
indeed she has done in the past,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
