Iran  will try to lure foreign
investors with tax exemptions ranging as high as 100 percent,
Iranian Deputy Economy Minister Behrouz Alishiri said.  Foreigners investing in the country’s agriculture sector
won’t have to pay any taxes, and investments in industry and
mining will be exempt up to 80 percent, Alishiri said yesterday,
according to Tehran-based newspaper  Tehran Times . He didn’t
forecast how much investment the exemptions would spur.  While international sanctions have restricted foreign
investment, Interior Minister Mostafa Mohammad-Najjar said in
March that Iran attracted $7 billion from abroad in the Iranian
year ended March 20, compared with $5 billion the preceding
year. He didn’t identify the donors or their projects, and the
newspaper did not say what sort of tax breaks foreign investors
currently enjoy.  Iran needs annual domestic and foreign investment of about
$300 billion until 2015 to meet its economic objectives,
Alishiri said in a separate Mehr news agency report last week.  International sanctions against Iran over its nuclear
program have limited foreign companies’ involvement in Iranian
business, weakened the country’s currency and contributed to
inflation that reached 34 percent in May. The economy will
shrink 1.3 percent in 2013, the  International Monetary Fund 
predicts.  Iran denies Western powers’ claims that its nuclear program
is aimed at developing weapons, and seeks to downplay the
sanctions’ effect.  To contact the reporter on this story:
