The  Dollar Index  fell from a three-year high amid speculation it climbed too far, too fast after a
report last week showing stronger-than-forecast U.S. job growth
fueled bets the  Federal Reserve  will soon slow its stimulus.  The euro advanced for the first time in three days versus
the dollar as risk appetite increased and European and U.S.
stocks rose. The dollar declined versus most major peers. Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  is scheduled to speak on economic
policy on July 10, the same day the central bank will release
minutes of its June policy meeting.  “It’s a reversal of the strong dollar trend that came last
Friday,” Charles St-Arnaud, a foreign-exchange strategist at
Nomura Holdings Inc. in New York, said in a telephone interview.
“The market may have gone too far to the extreme in terms of
pricing in the tempering of asset purchases.”  The Dollar Index, which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six U.S. trade
partners, fell 0.3 percent to 84.207 at 5 p.m. New York time
after reaching 84.588 earlier, the highest since July 6, 2010.  The euro advanced 0.3 percent to $1.2870 and  gained  0.1
percent to 129.95 yen. The dollar lost 0.2 percent to 100.97 yen
after gaining earlier to 101.53, the strongest since May 30.  A sustained break by the Dollar Index above a resistance
level at 84.50 would clear the way for a rise to 84.90 to 84.95,
 Niall O’Connor , a New York-based technical analyst at JPMorgan
Chase & Co., wrote in a client note. An increase beyond that may
mean a rally to 86.07 for the first time since July 1, 2010,
confirming a “deeper rally phase” for the currency, he wrote.
Resistance is a chart area where sell orders may be clustered.  Lower Volatility  JPMorgan’s  Group of Seven Volatility Index , based on
currency option premiums, fell to 10.66 percent, the lowest
since June 19. The 2013 average is 9.5 percent. The gauge
reached 11.96 percent June 24, the highest since January 2012.  Norway’s krone rebounded versus all of its 16 most-traded
counterparts after sliding July 5 to its weakest level since
September 2010. It appreciated as much as 1.8 percent, the
biggest intraday gain since May 8, to 6.14 per dollar before
trading at 6.1435. The krone rallied as much as 1.4 percent to
7.9075 per euro, its largest intraday jump since September 2011.  “The selling of the krone has been overdone, so in the
near term and next three months, we expect a correction toward
more moderate levels,” Ole Kjennerud, an economist at DNB ASA,
said from Oslo by telephone.  Rupee Drops  The rupee weakened to a record after the U.S. payrolls
report last week increased the relative attraction of American
assets. The Indian currency fell 0.6 percent to 60.6150 per
dollar and reached 61.2125, surpassing the previous record of
60.7650 set on June 26.  “The data could lead to outflows from all  emerging
markets ,” said Vikas Babu, a trader at state-run  Andhra Bank  in
Mumbai. “The central bank could come in and intervene to
protect key levels.”  Any dollar sales by the  Reserve Bank  of  India  will be aimed
at reducing market volatility, rather than supporting the
 exchange rate  as the rupee’s slide is in line with losses in
other currencies, according to Barclays Plc.  Bernanke will speak in  Boston  this week after he said
following the Fed’s June 18-19 meeting policy makers may reduce
bond purchases this year and end them in mid-2014 if economic
growth meets estimates. Fed officials forecast expansion of as
much as 2.6 percent this year and 3.5 percent in 2014.  U.S. payrolls increased by 195,000 in June for a second
consecutive month, the Labor Department reported on July 5.  ‘Protracted Exit’  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasuries and mortgage
bonds each month to put downward pressure on borrowing costs in
the third round of its quantitative-easing stimulus strategy.
The purchases tend to debase the currency.  “The Federal Reserve has begun a protracted exit from the
extraordinary monetary policy,”  Marc Chandler , chief currency
strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in New York, wrote
today in a client note. It “has signaled that, barring new
signs of weakness in the economy, it will likely slow its asset
purchases this year and conclude them next year.”  The dollar strengthened 7 percent in the past six months,
the best performer among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked
by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro rose 5.2
percent, while the yen tumbled 8.3 percent, the biggest loser.  Greek Talks  The euro rose for the first time in three days against the
dollar as the region’s finance ministers met in Brussels.
European governments agreed to release 3 billion euros ($3.9
billion) for  Greece , seeking to buy enough financial calm to
prevent another debt-crisis showdown until after  Germany ’s
elections in September.  In  Portugal , Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  proposed
that Paulo Portas, leader of the junior party in the governing
coalition, become vice premier. The appointment helps cement a
deal to hold the coalition together.  Trading in over-the-counter foreign-exchange options
totaled $27.2 billion, compared with $29 billion on July 5,
according to data reported by U.S. banks to the Depository Trust
Clearing Corp. and tracked by Bloomberg. Volume in options on
the euro-dollar exchange rate amounted to $4.7 billion, the
largest share of trades at 17.3 percent. Dollar-yen options also
totaled $4.7 billion, or 17.1 percent.  Dollar-yen options trading was 37 percent below the average
for the past five Mondays at a similar time in the day,
according to Bloomberg analysis. Euro-dollar options trading was
48 percent above average.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 1.4 percent, and the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
