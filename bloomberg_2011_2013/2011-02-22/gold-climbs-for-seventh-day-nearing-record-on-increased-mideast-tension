Gold declined for the first time in
seven days in  London  as a stronger dollar and a seven-week high
in prices prompted sales by some investors. Silver retreated
from a 30-year high and other precious metals also fell.  The U.S. Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the
greenback’s strength, climbed as much as 0.8 percent after the
Libyan government attacked protesters and rebels claimed control
of the second-biggest city, Benghazi. Gold, which today traded
about 1.4 percent from a record, typically moves inversely to
the dollar.  “The desire to take profits after the recent highs has
proved irresistible for some investors which, coupled with a
stronger dollar, has pushed gold” down, Marc Ground, an analyst
at Standard Bank Plc in Johannesburg, wrote in a report.
“Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and North Africa
region continue to fester, keeping  risk aversion  elevated and
enhancing the appeal of safe-haven assets.”  Immediate-delivery bullion fell $5.90, or 0.4 percent, to
$1,400.55 an ounce at 12:57 p.m. in London. Prices earlier rose
to $1,410.75, the highest level since Jan. 4. The metal for
April delivery was 0.9 percent higher at $1,400.60 on the Comex
in  New York . The Comex price includes trading yesterday, when
U.S. markets were closed for Presidents’ Day.  Bullion fell to $1,394.50 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,403 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing.  Bullion’s six-day gain was the longest streak since August.
Gold reached a record $1,431.25 an ounce on Dec. 7. Concern
about rising inflation and currency debasement drove prices up
30 percent last year for a 10th annual gain. Rising food and
commodity prices have contributed to uprisings in the Middle
East.  Libyan Protests    Libya  erupted into violence yesterday when leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s son threatened “rivers of blood” and deployed
security forces against protesters. The International Federation
for Human Rights says more than 300 people have died. The
country is the latest in the region to be rocked by protests
ignited by last month’s ouster of Tunisia’s president and fanned
by the Feb. 11 fall of Egyptian president  Hosni Mubarak .  “The desire to take profits grew among short-term
investors after gold’s recent rally,” said Lim Chae Myung,
Seoul-based trader with Hyundai Futures Co. “Coupled with a
stronger dollar, that’s taking some steam out of gold, but I
don’t believe this is a trend reversal.”  Silver for immediate delivery in London earlier climbed to
$34.3187 an ounce, the highest price since March 1980. It was
last down 2 percent at $33.215. Palladium slid 2.9 percent to
$833.83 an ounce after yesterday reaching $862.25, the highest
level since February 2001. Platinum was 1.4 percent lower at
$1,824.95 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
