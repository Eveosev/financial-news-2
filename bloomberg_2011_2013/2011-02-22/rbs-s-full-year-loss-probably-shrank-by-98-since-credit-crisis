  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ,
Britain’s biggest government-owned bank, may say its full-year
loss shrank by 98 percent from 2008, when it received a record
taxpayer-funded bailout.  The net loss will narrow to 404 million pounds ($655
million) as bad-loan provisions decline by a third, according to
the median estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. RBS
posted a 3.6 billion-pound loss in 2009 and a 24.3 billion-pound
loss in 2008, the biggest in U.K. corporate history. The bank,
run by Chief Executive Officer Stephen Hester, is on target for
a 2.45 billion pound profit in 2011, the survey showed. RBS will
report at 7 a.m. on Feb. 24.  “Hester has done a very impressive job at RBS,” said
Ralph Silva, a strategist at London-based Silva Research
Network, which provides research to financial companies.
“Narrowing the loss as much as he has is quite an
achievement.”  Hester, 50, is shrinking Edinburgh-based RBS by selling
assets, cutting jobs and reining in pay, a process he described
last year as the most complicated restructuring in global
corporate history. RBS, which received a 45.5 billion pound
taxpayer-funded bailout, has cut about 27,000 jobs since the
low-point of the credit crisis in 2008.  Hester will take a bonus for the first time since he
replaced  Fred Goodwin  in 2008, with the bank planning to award
him a 2 million-pound all-stock payout, the lender said. That
decision was attacked by  Nick Clegg , deputy prime minister, and  Ed Miliband , leader of the opposition Labour party last month.
Len McCluskey, leader of Britain’s biggest union,  Unite , said on
Feb. 9 that bankers like Hester are getting “lottery” pay
awards designed to fuel “extravagant lifestyles.”  ‘Unpopular’ Bonus  “Whatever happens with his bonus, it’s going to be
unpopular,” Silva said.  RBS’s 19,500 investment-banking employees will share a
bonus pool of less than 950 million pounds for 2010, a 27
percent reduction on 2009, as part of the Feb. 9 deal between
the U.K.’s biggest banks and government on pay restraint.  The lender will report that bad-loan provisions fell 33
percent to 9.28 billion pounds in 2010, according to a Bloomberg
survey of five analysts. Net income at the investment banking
unit, led by John Hourican, probably fell 28 percent to 7.91
billion pounds from 11 billion pounds in 2009, three analysts
said. By comparison, revenue at  Barclays Capital  dropped 25
percent to 13.3 billion pounds in 2010, the bank reported on
Feb. 15.  RBS’s loss for 2010 will be “nominal,” Hester said in
November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
