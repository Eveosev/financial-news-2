German  consumer confidence  will
increase to the highest level in three and a half years in March
as the economic recovery fuels income expectations, GfK AG
predicted.  The Nuremberg-based market research company said today that
its consumer sentiment index, based on a survey of about 2,000
people, will increase to 6 in March from a revised 5.8 in
February. That would be the highest since October 2007.  Germany’s economy is outpacing its euro-area counterparts
as booming exports to  Asia  prompt companies to increase hiring
and investment.  Volkswagen AG ,  Germany ’s biggest automotive
employer, this month agreed to boost compensation for 100,000
workers in the western part of the country by 3.2 percent to
avert strikes as orders surge. The country’s machinery sector
may create 20,000 jobs this year, the Frankfurt-based VDMA said
on Feb. 10.  “Against the backdrop of favorable labor-market
developments and the excellent economic situation of the
majority of companies, employees have big hopes of pay and wage
increases being more abundant this year than in the previous
ones,” GfK said in an e-mailed statement. Increasing income
expectations are “primarily responsible” for improving
consumer sentiment, it said.  Income Expectations  GfK’s indicator of income expectations jumped to 42.9 in
February from 37.7 in January. A gauge of households’ economic
expectations eased to 57.1 from 58.8, while an index of
consumers’ willingness to spend dropped to 38.9 from 41.8.  Puma AG,  Europe ’s second-largest sporting-goods maker,
predicted on Feb. 15 that profit will rise this year and next as
sales are boosted by the economic recovery.  Unemployment fell by 13,000 people in January, lowering the
jobless rate to 7.4 percent from 8.1 percent a year earlier.
The German government expects Europe’s largest economy to expand
2.3 percent this year after record growth of 3.6 percent in
2010.  “Consumers assume that the economy will develop positively
in the coming months even though it will probably not reach the
strong dynamic of last year,” GfK said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
