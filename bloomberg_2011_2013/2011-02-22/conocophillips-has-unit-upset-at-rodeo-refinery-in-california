  ConocoPhillips  had a “unit upset”
at its Rodeo oil refinery in  California  that resulted in
flaring, or the release of gases, according to a  filing  with
state regulators.  The incident happened yesterday at 1:42 p.m. local time,
according to the filing with the California Emergency Management
Agency. More than 500 pounds of sulfur dioxide was released
during the event, it said.  ConocoPhillips typically does not comment on day-to-day
refinery operations or regulatory filings, Rich Johnson, a
company spokesman, said in an e-mail. “There is no planned
maintenance work under way at the Rodeo refinery at this time.”  The refinery can process 128,000 barrels of crude oil a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
