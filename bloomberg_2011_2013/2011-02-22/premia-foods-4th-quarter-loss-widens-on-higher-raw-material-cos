AS Premia Foods, the largest Baltic
frozen-food producer, said its fourth-quarter loss widened due
to higher raw material prices for ice-cream production.  The net loss rose to 36.3 million Estonian krooni ($3.2
million) from 32.6 million krooni a year earlier, the Tallinn-
based company said today. Revenue rose 12 percent to 278 million
krooni, the company said.  Premia said it will raise its prices for customers during
the first quarter “to level out the negative impact” of raw
material price increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
