  VF Corp ., the world’s largest
apparel maker, closed at a record high in New York trading after
forecasting full-year profit that topped analysts’ estimates.  VF increased $6.72, or 7.5 percent, to $96.52 at 4:01 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the largest gain
since December 2008. The company makes Wrangler jeans and North
Face jackets. The shares have climbed 26 percent in 12 months.  Earnings may increase to as much as $7.10 a share this
year, the Greensboro, North Carolina-based company said today in
a statement. Analysts expected profit of $6.85 a share, the
average of 14 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  VF, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Eric Wiseman, cited revenue growth across all brands, driven by gains
in the “mid teens” in outdoor and action-sports apparel. The
company will also open 100 stores this year, the most for any
year in its history.  Sales will increase as much as 9 percent this year and
cotton prices are expected to drive up product costs 7 percent,
the company said. VF will overcome some of the inflation by
increasing prices of some apparel, including jeans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
