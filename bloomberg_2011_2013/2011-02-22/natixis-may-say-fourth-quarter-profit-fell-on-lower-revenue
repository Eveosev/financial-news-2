  Natixis  SA, the investment-banking
and asset-management unit of  France ’s second-biggest bank by
branches, may say fourth-quarter profit fell on lower revenue
and after it didn’t repeat tax gains.  Net income at the Paris-based bank probably dropped to 353
million euros ($483 million) from 844 million euros a year
earlier, according to the average estimate of seven analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Natixis is scheduled to report earnings tomorrow before the
market opens in Paris.  Following is a table of the expected results. Estimates for
net income ranged from 246 million euros to 413 million euros.
The figures below are in millions of euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
