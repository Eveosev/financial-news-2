Northern Energy Corp., an Australian
coal developer, said shareholders should accept  New Hope  Corp.’s
A$238 million ($239 million) cash takeover offer after talks
with alternative bidders failed.  “It is unlikely that an alternative superior proposal will
now be received” before the Feb. 25 expiry of New Hope’s bid,
Ipswich, Queensland-based Northern Energy, said today in a
statement. “As late as last night, advanced discussions were
terminated by the final alternative contenders.”  New Hope raised its bid to A$1.85 a share on Feb. 10, 95
percent more than Northern Energy’s share price before New Hope
made its initial approach. Northern Energy dropped 2.1 percent
to A$1.84 at the 4:10 p.m. close of trading in Sydney while New
Hope closed up 3.4 percent at A$4.86.  Merger and acquisition activity in  Australia ’s coal sector
rose last year as companies sought to benefit from surging
prices and sales to  Asia . Already this year, Alpha Natural
Resources Inc. agreed Jan. 29 to buy Massey Energy Co. for $7.1
billion in cash and stock.  Northern Energy appointed Merrill Lynch, a unit of Bank of
America Corp., as corporate adviser. New Hope appointed Pitt
Capital Partners Ltd. as its financial adviser.  To contact the reporter on this story:
