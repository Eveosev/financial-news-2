Blackpool beat Tottenham 3-1 to end
a run of six games without a victory in English soccer’s Premier
League and climb to 12th in the standings.    Charlie Adam ’s 18th-minute penalty put the Seasiders ahead
at Bloomfield Road and DJ Campbell made it 2-0 a minute before
halftime. Brett Ormerod finished off a counterattack to add the
third goal with 10 minutes left before  Roman Pavlyuchenko ’s
deflected strike completed the scoring.  The win lifts Blackpool up four places with 32 points, five
clear of the three-team relegation zone. Tottenham, which won
1-0 at AC Milan seven days ago in the Champions League round of
16, stays in fourth place with 47 points.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
