The Nabucco pipeline to transport
natural gas to Europe may cost 14 billion euros ($19 billion)
instead of the 7.9 billion euros it currently is estimated to
cost, The Guardian reported, citing an assessment from  BP Plc .  The cost would increase partly because of “soaring
commodity prices,” with the price of iron ore having increased
by half in the past year, according to newspaper.  Nabucco would transport gas from BP’s fields in the Caspian
Sea to Austria, the paper said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
