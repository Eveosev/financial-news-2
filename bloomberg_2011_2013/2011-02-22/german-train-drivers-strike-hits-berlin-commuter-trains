Berlin commuter train services are
being disrupted by a drivers’ strike this morning, according to
the commuter train website ( http://www.s-bahn-berlin.de/ ).  The GDL union said earlier that it would take strike action
as talks over wages with Deutsche Bahn AG have failed. The
strike will end at 8 a.m. local time, according to oral
information given to passengers.  To contact the reporters on this story: Holger Elfes in
