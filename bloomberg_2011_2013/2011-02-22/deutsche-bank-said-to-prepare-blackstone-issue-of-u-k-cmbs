Deutsche Bank AG is working on a
securitization of a loan used by  Blackstone Group LP  to buy an
office complex in  London , according to a person with direct
knowledge of the transaction.  Deutsche Bank may sell about 300 million pounds ($483
million) of commercial mortgage-backed securities, said the
person, who declined to be named because the details are
private. The bonds will be backed by a loan used by Blackstone
to buy the Chiswick Park office complex, said the person.  Armin Niedermeier, a Frankfurt-based spokesman for Deutsche
Bank, declined to comment. Reuters reported the deal earlier.  Mortgage-backed securities bundle income from real-estate
loans, slicing them into layers of different risk to be sold to
investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
