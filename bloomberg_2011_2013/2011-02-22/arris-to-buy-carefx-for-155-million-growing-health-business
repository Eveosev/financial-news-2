  Harris Corp ., maker of military
radios and information-technology solutions, is making a bigger
push into the health-care market, purchasing  Carefx Corp.  for
$155 million.  Carefx, based in Scottsdale, Arizona, provides products to
manage and view patient information, including X-rays and
electronic health records. The closely held company’s software
is used in more than 800 hospitals, health-care systems and
health information exchanges in  North America ,  Europe  and Asia,
the two companies said in a  statement  released today.  “It’s a key growth area for Harris,” Jim Traficant, vice
president and general manager of Harris Healthcare Solutions,
said in an interview. “Health care is a very large, high-growth
market undergoing a digital transformation.”  Melbourne, Florida-based Harris, which provides health
information exchange services to the Defense and Veterans
Affairs departments, will offer Carefx software to government
customers, Traficant said.  Harris said it also will gain a foothold in the commercial
health-care market with the Carefx acquisition. Current Carefx
customers include  Boston Medical Center ,  Emory University
Hospital  and Northwestern Medical Hospital.  Harris is acquiring Carefx in an all-cash deal, which is
expected to close in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Harris
said it will finance the acquisition with a combination of cash
and commercial paper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
