  India ’s central bank eased rules on
lending to off-grid solar power projects, saying banks will be
permitted to extend subsidized loans to programs such as village
lighting schemes.  Banks can provide loans to such projects at a subsidized
interest rate of as much as 5 percent of which 2 percent can be
refinanced with the government, the  Reserve Bank  of India said
in a  notice  on its website.  The base rate, or minimum rate at which a bank is permitted
to lend, ranges from 7.25 percent to 9.5 percent, according to
Bloomberg data. The base rate of the  State Bank  of India, the
nation’s biggest lender, is 8.25 percent.  Borrowers setting up off-grid projects under the National
Solar Mission are eligible for the subsidized rate, the notice
said. These projects include solar lighting systems for
villages, standalone photovoltaic and thermal power plants that
provide electricity to rural areas unconnected to the grid, and
other heating, cooling and power installations that can replace
equipment currently running on diesel.  India’s Solar Mission aims to set up 20,000 megawatts of
solar capacity by 2022, including 2,000 megawatts of off-grid
applications. Under the first phase, it plans to install 200
megawatts of off-grid solar capacity by 2013, according to the
Ministry of New and  Renewable Energy .  To contact the reporter on this story:
