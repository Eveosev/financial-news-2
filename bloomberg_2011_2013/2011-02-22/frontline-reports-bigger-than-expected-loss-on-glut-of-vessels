Frontline Ltd., the world’s largest
operator of supertankers, posted a bigger-than-expected fourth-
quarter loss and declared a dividend that missed estimates after
charter costs plunged on a glut of vessels.  The net loss was $11.8 million, or 15 cents a share,
compared with profit of $3.92 million, or 5 cents, a year
earlier, the Hamilton, Bermuda-based company said today in a
 statement . Frontline was expected to post a 13.4-cent loss,
based on the mean estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
The 10-cent dividend missed an anticipated payout of 23.5 cents.  “The surprising thing for me is the low dividend and what
it means for future dividends, since we expect loss-making
quarters through 2011 and 2012,” said Erik Nikolai Stavseth, an
analyst at Arctic Securities ASA in Oslo. The company “will not
be appealing to yield-based investors.”  Frontline rose 3.8 kroner, or 2.6 percent, to 149.5 kroner
at the 5:30 p.m. close in Oslo trading, giving the company a
market value of 11.6 billion kroner ($2 billion).  Charter costs for supertankers fell to a 13-month low in
October as vessels from the biggest building program in history
left yards.  ‘Large Gap’  “This weakness might continue until the current large gap
between supply and demand in the tanker market narrows,”
Frontline said in the statement. The company’s very large crude
carriers, or VLCCs, each earned $24,700 a day in the quarter.
Frontline said it needs $30,100 a day this year to break even.  The company may return to profit this quarter, according to
the mean of six analyst estimates, after returns for tanker
owners surged more than sixfold in less than a month from Jan.
27 as oil buyers booked the most vessels since at least 2005.  The surplus of VLCCs in the  Persian Gulf  has averaged 15
percent so far this year, according to Bloomberg surveys
comparing 30-day supply with expected cargoes. That’s the same
as the 2010 average, according to the owners and brokers
surveyed.  Returns from the industry’s benchmark Saudi Arabia-to-Japan
shipping route today declined 31 percent to $29,400 a day,
according to data from the  Baltic Exchange  in  London . That was
the biggest drop since the first trading day of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
