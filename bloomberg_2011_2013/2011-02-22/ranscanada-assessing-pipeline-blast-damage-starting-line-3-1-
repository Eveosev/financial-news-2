  TransCanada Corp . said it has staff
on the site of a Feb. 19 explosion and fire on its mainline
system and that one of three lines in the network is working.  The Calgary-based company has employees on the site of the
blast near Beardmore, Ontario, where access was hampered by
snow, James Millar, a TransCanada spokesman, said in a telephone
interview. Investigators from  Canada ’s Transportation Safety
Board and National Energy Board must release the site before
repairs can begin, he said.  “We’re hopeful that they will release the site to us in
the next day or two so we can begin repairs,” Millar said.
“Line 1 is fully operational, we’re still working on Line 3,
it’s just an issue of ensuring it’s operating appropriately. It
hasn’t impacted customers at all.”  TransCanada’s mainline system links natural-gas fields in  Alberta  with points in central Canada and terminates at the
Quebec-Vermont border. Line 2 of the three-tube system exploded
and burned for about eight hours after operators closed valves
from a remote control room.  The blast site, 170 kilometers (105 miles) north of Thunder
Bay, Ontario, is remote and has to be reached by helicopter or
snowmobile, Millar said. TransCanada’s mainline system can carry
as much as 7 billion cubic feet of gas a day. Shipments averaged
about 3.4 billion cubic feet daily in 2010, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
