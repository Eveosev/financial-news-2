  Credit Agricole SA ,  France ’s third-
largest bank, may post a fourth-quarter loss because of a
writedown on its stake in  Italy ’s  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA .  Credit Agricole probably had a net loss of 422 million
euros ($576 million) compared with net income of 433 million
euros a year earlier, according to the average estimate of 15
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The bank said in December it planned to book a fourth-
quarter writedown of about 1.25 billion euros as it reclassified
its 4.79 percent stake in Milan-based Intesa as a financial
asset. Credit Agricole also decided to end its representation on
the Italian lender’s supervisory board. The French company said
on Dec. 17 it estimated the size of the writedown based on
Intesa’s share price at the time.    Credit Agricole , based in Montrouge near Paris, is slated
to report earnings on Feb. 24 at 7 a.m. local time.  Following is a table of the expected results. Estimates for
the net loss ranged between a 173 million-euro deficit and a
loss of 624 million euros. The figures below are in millions of
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
