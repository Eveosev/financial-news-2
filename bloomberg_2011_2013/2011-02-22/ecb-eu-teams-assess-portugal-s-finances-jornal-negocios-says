  European Central Bank  and European
Commission officials are in Lisbon to assess the country’s
public accounts and the strength of the financial industry,
Jornal de Negocios reported, citing an unidentified person in

the commission and the ECB will assess the progress of euro-
region countries in terms of implementing budget consolidation
measures, the Finance Ministry official said, according to the
Portuguese newspaper.  The meetings with banks are being carried out at a
“technical level” and the ECB and commission teams aim to
collect more updated and detailed information about the
liquidity and solvency situations of Portugal’s larger banks,
