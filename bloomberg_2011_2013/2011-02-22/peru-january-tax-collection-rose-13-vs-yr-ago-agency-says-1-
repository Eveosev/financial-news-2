Peru’s tax collection rose 13
percent in January as rising prices for the Andean country’s
metals boosted revenue, the government said.  Tax collection was 6.5 billion soles ($2.3 billion) last
month, the state tax and import duty collection agency  Sunat 
said in an e-mailed statement.  Income tax revenue grew 16 percent after metal prices
increased, the agency said. Growing economic activity spurred a
13 percent rise in sales tax collection, it said.  The sol weakened 0.3 percent to 2.7805 per dollar at 2:22
p.m. New York time from 2.7715 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
