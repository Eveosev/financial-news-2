The  Federal Reserve  needs to act to
prevent a recurrence of the high inflation that occurred in the
1970s, Dallas Fed President  Richard Fisher  said in an interview
with the Washington Post.  “I think you have to be careful that this doesn’t get out
of control,” Fisher said about inflation, according to the
newspaper. “I haven’t forgotten how quickly high inflation took
grip and how things spun out of control. I remember the painful
cure that had to be imposed.”  Fisher said the Fed’s latest planned easing, the purchase
of $600 billion in Treasury securities through June, is “a fait
accompli” and repeated his view that he wouldn’t support
additional easing.  The Dallas Fed chief said last week he’ll be among the
first policy makers to push for tighter policy as the economy
improves and that one possible first step may be the sale of
some of the central bank’s  Treasury securities .  To contact the reporters on this story:
