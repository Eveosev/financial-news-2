  Allstate Corp ., the largest publicly
traded U.S. home and auto insurer, raised its dividend for the
first time since 2008 after posting a seventh straight quarterly
profit.  The dividend was boosted 5 percent to 21 cents a share from
20 cents, Northbrook, Illinois-based Allstate said today in a
statement. Stockholders of record on March 11 will receive the
payouts on April 1.  Net income in the fourth quarter slipped to $296 million,
or 55 cents a share, from $518 million, or 96 cents, a year
earlier, Allstate said in a Feb. 9 statement. Chief Executive
Officer  Thomas Wilson  said the insurer has $3.8 billion in cash
and liquid securities to fund dividends and share repurchases.
Allstate announced a $1 billion share-buyback program on Nov. 9.  “If we don’t have a use for the capital, we give it back
to the shareholders,” Wilson said in a conference call on Feb.
10. “When we’re done with this one, if we still have extra
capital, we’ll consider doing another one.”  Allstate last announced a dividend increase in February
2008, when the payout was boosted to 41 cents a share from 38
cents. The dividend was cut to 20 cents a year later after three
straight quarterly losses.  Allstate declined 37 cents to $31.74 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, and has advanced about 1.1
percent in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
