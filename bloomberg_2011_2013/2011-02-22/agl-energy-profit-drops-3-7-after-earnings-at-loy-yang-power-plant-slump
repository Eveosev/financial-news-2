  AGL Energy Ltd ., the Australian
electricity and gas retailer, said first-half underlying profit
dropped 3.7 percent after a lower-than-expected contribution
from the Loy Yang coal-fired power station in Victoria.  Profit excluding one-time items in the six months ended
Dec. 31 declined to A$226.2 million from A$234.8 million a year
earlier, Sydney-based AGL said in a statement today to the
Australian stock exchange.  “We are disappointed in the poor contribution from Loy
Yang,” Managing Director Michael Fraser said in the statement.
“Unfortunately, this is not expected to improve in the second
half, but we are forecasting further strong growth from our
retail business and an improvement in our wholesale electricity
business.”  AGL on Feb. 7 cut its full-year profit forecast to between
A$415 million and A$440 million from a prior projection of A$450
million to A$480 million, citing “extreme weather,” including
a cyclone and floods in Queensland and record heat in Sydney.  The Loy Yang power plant’s contribution to earnings dropped
by 98 percent, or A$22.4 million, because of lower pool
electricity prices.  The power supplier said today it still expects to deliver
full-year results “in line” with the prior forecast.  AGL said it had to buy electricity at increased wholesale
prices as surging temperatures boosted demand. The Yabulu power
station was shut down because of Cyclone Yasi and gas supplies
to the Oakey generator were disrupted.  Net income rose 30 percent to A$239.6 million as sales
climbed 9 percent to A$3.49 billion. AGL maintained the interim
dividend at 29 Australian cents a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:  James Paton  in Sydney   jpaton4@bloomberg.net .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
