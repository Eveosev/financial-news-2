Cocoa rose to a 32-year high in New
York on concern that supplies from  Ivory Coast , the world’s
biggest producer, will continue to be disrupted as
an export ban of the chocolate ingredient is extended.  Alassan Ouattara, the internationally recognized winner of
the November presidential elections, will extend a ban that was
imposed Jan. 23 and scheduled to expire this week, according to
Malick Tohe, a cocoa adviser to Quattara. Before today, the
commodity has gained 25 percent since late November.  “With no end to the political problems in sight, prices
will remain buoyant,” said  Jack Scoville , a vice president at
Price Futures Group Inc. in  Chicago . “Exports from the country
are impossible, so people are worried about deterioration of
the beans.”  Cocoa for May delivery climbed $87, or 2.5 percent, to
settle at $3,586 a metric ton at 12 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York , after touching $3,608, the highest price since
January 1979. Trading was closed yesterday for the U.S.
Presidents Day holiday.  Scoville said he expects the price to rise to $3,655 by
the end of this week.  In London, cocoa for March delivery rose 61 pounds, or 2.7
percent, to 2,362 pounds ($3,808) a ton on NYSE Liffe.  In Ivory Coast’s main port of Abidjan, the army has
“reinforced the deployment” of troops to help keep order,
Hilaire Babri Gohourou, an army spokesman, said on state-owned
Radio Television Ivoirienne yesterday. At least 300 people have
been killed in clashes since the vote, according to the  United
Nations .  Shipments of  cocoa beans  and processed cocoa products
registered at  Ivory Coast’s  ports for export totaled 662,409
tons from start of the season on Oct. 1 through Feb. 17,
according to an industry official with access to the data. In
the 14 days to Feb. 17, cocoa-bean exports totaled 8,645 tons,
said the official, who declined to be identified because the
data are confidential.  To contact the reporters on this story:
