Parex Banka AS’s minority
shareholders, including East Capital and Firebird, want to hold
talks with the Latvian government over investments made in the
Riga-based lender that required a state rescue in 2008.  The group of investors delivered a request to officials
including Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis seeking the
“involvement of Latvian government representatives in order to
protect the investments of minority shareholders in Parex
bank,” they said in an e-mailed statement.  Parex was taken over by the state and split into a new
retail bank called Citadele and a resolution bank which plans to
sell off non-performing assets.  Latvia  poured 1.1 billion lati
($2.1 billion) of state guarantees, capital and liquidity
support into Parex after the state rescue, which forced the
country to turn a group led by the European Commission and the
 International Monetary Fund  for a 7.5 billion-euro ($10.2
billion) loan.  Minority shareholders’ stakes in the bank dropped to 2
percent from 8 percent. They were not allowed to purchase new
shares and decide on capital increases, they said in the
statement.  The investors are made up of Amber Trust, KJK Fund,
Firebird Republics Fund, Firebird New Russia Fund, Firebird
Avrora Fund and East Capital, the statement said. The investors
will appeal to the governments of the U.S.,  Sweden  and  Belgium 
against Latvia for breaches of bilateral investment protection
treaties, they said in the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
