Time Inc., the magazine publisher
owned by  Time Warner Inc ., said Randall Rothenberg, who in
January became its first chief digital officer, resigned to go
back to his former job.  Rothenberg will return as president and chief executive
officer of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, which he led for
almost four years before joining Time, according to statements
today from the publisher and the New York-based digital trade
group.  The announcement of Rothenberg’s departure came less than a
week after Jack Griffin, the chief executive officer of Time
Inc., left the company after six months in the post.    Jeff Bewkes , CEO of New York-based Time Warner, last week
said he concluded that Griffin’s “leadership style and approach
did not mesh with Time Inc. and Time Warner.” Griffin followed
with a statement disputing Bewkes’s characterization and saying
that his leaving “was clearly not about management style or
results.”  When Griffin hired Rothenberg at the magazine publisher, he
called him “the ideal candidate to lead Time Inc.’s digital
growth strategy.”  Time Warner fell 48 cents to $37.70 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained
17 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
