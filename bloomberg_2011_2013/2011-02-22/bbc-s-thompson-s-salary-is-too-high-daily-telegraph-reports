British Broadcasting Corp. Director
General Mark Thompson is paid too much and his 838,000 pound
($1.4 million) salary is “out of kilter” with current
circumstances, Michael Grade, former chairman of the  BBC  said,
the  Daily Telegraph  reported.  Grade recruited Thompson in 2004 and negotiated the pay
deal, which seemed “reasonable” at the time, himself, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
