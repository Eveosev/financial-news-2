The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Chilean trading. Stock symbols are in

straight day of losses.  Cia. Sudamericana de Vapores SA (VAPORES CC) lost 1 percent
to 455.2 pesos, after falling as much as 3.2 percent.  Oil prices 
rose to their highest level in more than two years on concern of
production disruptions in  Libya , signaling higher transport
costs for Latin America’s largest container shipping company.    Empresas Hites SA  (HITES CC), a Chilean retailer, fell 1.1
percent to 630 pesos, after plunging up to 5.7 percent, the most
in almost six months. Inflation expectations are rising in Chile
after the government decreed an increase in public
transportation rates in Santiago on higher oil prices, signaling
lower demand for consumer loans. Chilean inflation forwards are
discounting annual inflation of 4.79 percent in May, according
to Banco Santander SA prices, the highest since March 2009.    Paz Corp SA  (PAZ CC) retreated 1.4 percent to 485 pesos.
The Chilean homebuilder has lost up to 7.4 percent in the last
two days, leading losses among construction companies, after the
brokerage division of Grupo Security SA cut the stock to
“hold” from “buy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
