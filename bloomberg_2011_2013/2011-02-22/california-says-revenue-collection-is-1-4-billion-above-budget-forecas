  California  has collected $1.4
billion more in revenue so far this fiscal year than was
projected in the budget, a surplus that may help Governor  Jerry Brown  and lawmakers fill an estimated $25 billion deficit.  Tax and fee  revenue  for the fiscal year that began July 1
was $52.7 billion through the end of January, or 2.7 percent
above projections, according to  figures  released by the Finance
Department today.  Brown, 72, a Democrat who was governor from 1975 to 1983,
has vowed to fix the financial strains leaving California with
the biggest deficit of all U.S. states, and the lowest  credit
rating . He proposes $12 billion of spending reductions and wants
lawmakers to call a special election in June for voter
permission to extend $10 billion of higher vehicle fees, sales
taxes and income-tax rates to avoid even deeper cuts.  So far this fiscal year, personal income-tax revenue has
exceeded projections by $1.3 billion, or 4.5 percent. The
finance department said itâ€™s unclear yet how much of that
increase can be traced to a stronger state economy.  An increase in December income tax receipts could mean much
of the year-to-date increase is a result of taxpayers who remit
their fourth-quarter estimated payment in December so they can
claim the payment as a federal income-tax deduction for the 2010
year, rather than the 2011 year. If so, the increase could be
offset in April when taxes are due.  To contact the reporter on this story:
