  Mediobanca SpA ,  Italy ’s biggest
publicly traded investment bank, may say fiscal second-quarter
profit climbed 48 percent on higher interest income and after
setting aside less money for bad loans.  Net income probably rose to 102 million euros ($138
million) in the three months to Dec. 31, from 69 million euros a
year earlier, according to the average estimate of 10 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The bank is due to publish results on
Feb. 25.  Mediobanca Chief Executive Officer Alberto Nagel said in
October the bank may consider acquisitions in private banking or  consumer credit  in a bid to boost revenue. The company aims to
continue paying dividends for the current year.  Loan-loss provisions in the quarter probably declined 14
percent to 111 million euros, while net interest income may have
gained 14 percent to 261 million euros, according to analyst
estimates. Net trading income probably slumped 62 percent to 18
million euros because of widening spreads on Italian  government
bonds , said analysts including Atanasio Pantarrotas at Credit
Agricole Cheuvreux.  Below is a table of analysts’ forecasts and year-earlier
figures in millions of euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
