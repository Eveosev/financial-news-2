  New Zealand ’s dollar fell to the
lowest level since December on speculation the central bank will
delay increases to its benchmark interest rate as the nation
recovers from a magnitude 6.3 earthquake.    Australia ’s currency was 0.3 percent from an almost three-
week low against the yen as futures signaled Asian equities will
extend a global sell-off after Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi 
pledged to deploy the army and police to fight a growing
rebellion. Declines in the so-called Aussie were limited after
Australian central bank Governor Glenn Stevens said mining
investment may rise by as much as 2 percent of gross domestic
product in the next few years.  “We’re not expecting that the  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand
will start cutting rates but they might push out tightening,”
said Besa Deda, chief economist at St. George Bank in Sydney.
“The kiwi is being sold just like the Aussie on increased  risk
aversion  relating to tensions in the Middle East and the equity
sell-off.”  New Zealand’s dollar declined 0.2 percent to 74.48 U.S.
cents as of 9:56 a.m. in Sydney, the lowest since Dec. 23, from
74.64 cents in  New York  yesterday. It bought 61.64 yen from
61.78 yen after yesterday dropping 2.7 percent.  Australia’s currency fetched 99.86 U.S. cents from 99.88
cents in New York yesterday. The currency bought 82.65 yen from
82.67 yesterday when it reached as low as 82.48 yen, the least
since Feb. 3.  Traders bet yesterday that New Zealand’s central bank will
increase its key rate by 24 basis points over 12 months, down
from 50 basis points on Feb. 21, according to a Credit Suisse AG
index based on swaps. Yesterday’s earthquake struck
Christchurch, the nation’s second-largest city. It may cost
reinsurers about NZ$5 billion ($3.7 billion), Prime Minister
John Key said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
