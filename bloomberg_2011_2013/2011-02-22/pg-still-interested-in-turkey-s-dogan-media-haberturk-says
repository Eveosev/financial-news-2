TPG Capital, a U.S. private equity
firm, is still interested in the sale of assets by Turkey’s
biggest media group  Dogan Yayin Holding AS ,  Haberturk  said,
citing TPG managing partner Vincenzo Morelli.  TPG, one of the three shortlisted bidders in the Dogan
Yayin asset sale, will look for other opportunities should its
bid fail, Morelli said, according to the Istanbul-based
newspaper.  TPG and its Turkish partner Actera agreed yesterday with
Diageo Plc to sell Mey Icki, Turkey’s biggest alcoholic
beverages producer, to Diageo Plc for $2.1 billion, the
companies said. TPG held 90 percent in Mey Icki and Actera owned
the remainder.    Gozde Finansal Hizmetler AS , a financial services company
owned by Turkey’s Yildiz Holding AS, is partnering KKR & Co. LP
to bid for Dogan Yayin assets, Gozde said on Feb. 3.  Time Warner
Inc . is also shortlisted, three people familiar with the matter
said on Oct. 13.  Dogan Yayin, owned by the Istanbul-based Dogan Sirketler
Grubu Holding AS, is seeking buyers for its units after the
government demanded $3.8 billion in back taxes and fines.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc . is advising Dogan on the sale of the
assets, which include television channels Kanal D, CNN Turk, the
Posta newspaper and scores of magazines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
