OAO  Raspadskaya , a producer of coal
for steelmaking that fell from Russia’s second to fifth biggest
after blasts at its main mine that killed 90 people, will pay in
excess of $1 billion to more than double output in five years.  The company, based in Kemerovo, Siberia, plans $976 million
of  capital spending  and $54.8 million for maintenance through
2015, it said by e-mailed statement today. Output will reach
18.5 million metric tons in 2015, up from 7.2 million last year.  Raspadskaya shut its main mine for seven months and halted
exports after the deadly explosions in May. The company plans to
resume shipments abroad this year, with at least 35 percent of
output going to markets such as  South Korea ,  China  and Japan in
the medium term, it said in a presentation on its  website .  One face at the eponymous mine resumed production on Dec.
16, with two others scheduled to restart in the second and third
quarters, and two in the fourth quarter, the company said. The
mine will produce 2.5 million tons of coal this year, boosting
Raspadskaya’s overall output 19 percent to 8.5 million tons.  To contact the reporters on this story:
