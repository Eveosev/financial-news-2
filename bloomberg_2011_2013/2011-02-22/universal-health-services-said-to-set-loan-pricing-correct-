(Corrects interest rate in fifth paragraph.)    Universal Health Services Inc ., the
operator of more than 100 U.S. medical facilities, set pricing
on $3.45 billion of debt it’s refinancing, according to a person
with knowledge of the negotiations.  Lenders must let the JPMorgan Chase & Co.-led banking group
arranging the transaction know by March 7 whether they will
participate in the deal, the person said.  The company is offering to pay an interest rate 3
percentage points more than the London interbank offered rate on
a $1.6 billion term loan B, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the talks are private. The lending benchmark
will have a 1 percent floor.  Universal may sell the debt, which matures November 2016,
at 100 cents on the dollar, the person said.  The interest margin on the $1.05 billion  term loan  A and an
$800 million line of credit will be 2.25 percentage points more
than Libor and the lending benchmark will have no floor, the
person said. The loans both have November 2015 maturity dates.  The debt may be sold at 99.75 cents on the dollar, the
person said, reducing proceeds for the borrower and boosting the
yield for investors.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan, it can’t. A term loan A is
sold primarily to banks, while a term loan B is mainly bought by
non-bank lenders such as collateralized loan obligations, bank-
loan mutual funds and  hedge funds .  To contact the reporter on this story:
