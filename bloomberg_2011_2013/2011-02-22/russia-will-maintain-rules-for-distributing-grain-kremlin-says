Russia will maintain rules for
selling grain in tenders and making direct distributions from
stockpiles unless the market shows signs of instability,
according to President  Dmitry Medvedev ’s press service.  “Let’s agree on the following about grain, because the
topic is resonant: we preserve all those rules that exist,
taking into account the fact that the situation is stable on the
grain market,” the service quoted Medvedev on its  website  today
as saying in a meeting with First Deputy Prime Minister  Viktor
Zubkov . “However, if some nuances arise, I will naturally
expect a report from the government. And we will define finally
what to do.”  News service Interfax said Feb. 9 Medvedev had urged
suspending domestic grain tenders and reviewing other ways to
distribute state inventories.  To contact the reporter on this story:
