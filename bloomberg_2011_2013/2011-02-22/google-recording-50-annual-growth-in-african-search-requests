  Google Inc . is benefiting from 50
percent annual growth in search requests coming from sub-Saharan
Africa as people in the region gain  Internet access  through
mobile devices, Business Development Associate Ayite Gaba said.  About 40 percent of search requests coming from mobile
devices, Gaba told a conference in Dakar,  Senegal , hosted by the  Mountain View , California-based company.  The adoption of smart phones in the region is also powering
growth in other services, such as Facebook, he said. The social
networking platform is receiving 100,000 new Senegalese users
each month at the moment, Gaba said. The number of YouTube video
plays within sub-Saharan Africa is doubling each year, he said.  “In a few months there will be more users online through
their phones than their home internet here in Senegal and in
sub-Saharan  Africa ,” Gaba said.  Still, Google doesn’t “see Africa as an immediately
profitable place,” Vice President for Operations in Eastern
Europe, Southern Europe, Middle East, and Africa, Carlo d’Asaro
Blondo, told the conference.  Sub-Saharan Africa is the world’s most expensive place for
internet connectivity, with home internet connections averaging
$45 a month, according to Google statistics presented in a
slideshow.  A lack of local content is also hindering new connections,
Blondo said, citing a study that showed only 0.2 percent of the
world’s 255 million web pages were created by Africans.  “If Africans can’t find web pages that are relevant to
them, they won’t have a reason to connect,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
