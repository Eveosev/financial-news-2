Algeria’s government approved the
ending of a 19-year-old state of emergency, after protests
similar to those that ousted presidents in Egypt and  Tunisia .  The country’s council of ministers adopted a law today
revoking the 1993 decree that prolonged a state of emergency
originally instituted the previous year, government-run news
agency Algerie Presse Service reported on its website today.  The end of the state of emergency has been a rallying point
for protesters who staged demonstrations across Algeria last
month. The measure was imposed after the cancellation of the
country’s first multiparty elections that Islamists were set to
win in 1992.  The “law will come into effect as soon as its imminent
publication in the official journal,” the council of ministers
said in a statement, according to APS.  President Abdelaziz Bouteflika said on Feb. 3 that
demonstrations, banned under the state of emergency, would be
permitted across  Algeria , except in the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
