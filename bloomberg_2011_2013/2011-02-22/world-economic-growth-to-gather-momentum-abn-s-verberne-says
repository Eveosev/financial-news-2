The pace of global economic growth
will gather pace led by the U.S. and European economies, said
Guy Verberne, Head of Investment Strategy at ABN Amro Bank NV.  “The recovery in world trade is steep and the world
economy is gaining steam moving into 2011,” Verberne said at
the Capital Link Greek shipping Forum in Athens today. “We’re
picking up fast.”  The  U.S. economy  is benefiting from improved domestic
demand while core euro region countries, especially  Germany ,
“are doing well,” he said.  Investors are betting that the U.S. will lead global
economic growth. U.S. imports of $203.5 billion in December were
the most in two years. The Conference Board’s index of  consumer
confidence  climbed to an almost three-year peak in January. The
Institute for Supply Management Chicago Inc. said businesses
expanded in January at the fastest pace since July 1988.  The German economy is driving euro-region growth after
demand from faster-growing economies such as China boosted
exports, fueling company investment and helping push
unemployment to the lowest in almost two decades.  Emerging economies that are driving the global recovery
“have run into capacity constraints” and countries such as  China  are “clearly overheating,” Verberne said.  While soaring food prices, rising currencies and
speculative capital inflows all pose a threat to emerging market
states, including the so-called BRIC countries of Brazil,
Russia,  India  and China, these difficulties are “manageable,”
he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
