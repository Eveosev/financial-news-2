A surplus of supertankers competing
for 2 million-barrel cargoes of Middle East oil expanded,
cutting what owners can charge for charters.  There are 10 percent more very large crude carriers, or
VLCCs, for hire over the next 30 days than there are likely
cargoes, according to the median estimate of seven shipbrokers
and two owners surveyed today. That’s up from a 7 percent excess
a week ago.  Rental income on the Saudi Arabia-to-Japan route that’s
used to settle freight derivatives plunged 31 percent to $29,400
a day today, according to the  Baltic Exchange  in  London . That’s
the biggest daily decline since Jan. 4.  That’s less than the $30,100 that Frontline Ltd., the
world’s biggest VLCC operator, needs to break even on the ships.
It’s above the $12,777 that Drewry Shipping Consultants Ltd.
estimates the vessels need to pay crew, repairs and other
running costs.  In industry standard Worldscale terms, the Saudi Arabia-to-
Japan freight rate fell 13 percent to 67.12 points, according to
the Baltic Exchange.  The Baltic Dirty Tanker Index, an overall measure of crude-
oil transportation costs, fell 0.9 percent to 768 points,
according to the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
