Japanese  stock futures  and
Australian shares fell after escalating violence in Libya and a
surge in oil prices sparked concern global growth will slow.  American depositary receipts of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial
Group Inc., Japan’s second-biggest publicly traded bank, fell
1.2 percent from the closing share price in Tokyo. Those of
Toyota Motor Corp., a Japanese automaker that earns about 70
percent of its revenue abroad, dropped 1.3 percent. Australia &
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., Australia’s third-largest bank
by market value, slipped 0.7 percent.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225  Stock Average expiring in
March closed at 10,530 in  Chicago  yesterday, compared with
10,660 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
10,540 in  Osaka  at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index declined 0.2 percent today.  “The world economic outlook is becoming more uncertain,”
said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in Tokyo at Nikko
Cordial Securities Inc. “Investors are becoming more concerned
about inflation in emerging markets and higher corporate costs
because of rising oil prices.”  Stocks slumped yesterday from  Hong Kong  and  London  to Sao
Paulo as Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi vowed to fight a growing
rebellion until his “last drop of blood” and pledged to deploy
the army and police to impose order.  Middle East, Wal-Mart  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 2.1 percent in  New
York  yesterday, its biggest drop since August, as concern
mounted on the situation in the Middle East and as  Wal-Mart
Stores Inc ., the world’s biggest retailer, reported sales that
trailed its own forecasts. Futures on the index were little
changed today.  Crude oil for March delivery gained 8.6 percent to $93.57 a
barrel in New York yesterday, the highest settlement since Oct.
3, 2008, on concern that supplies from Libya, holder of Africa’s
largest crude reserves, may be disrupted.  The yen appreciated to as high as 82.58 against the dollar
today in Tokyo, compared with 83.31 at the close of stock
trading yesterday. Against the euro, Japan’s currency
strengthened to 112.24 last night from 113.23. A stronger yen
reduces overseas income at Japanese companies when converted
into their home currency.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 0.4 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 4.6 percent by the S&P
500 and 3.5 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 13.9 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.7 times for the S&P 500 and 11.3 times
for the Stoxx 600.  Today, 22 of the 1,019 companies in the MSCI index are
scheduled to release earnings statements. Of the 488 companies
that have reported results for the latest quarter, 191 have
exceeded analysts’ estimates, while 150 have missed them,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
