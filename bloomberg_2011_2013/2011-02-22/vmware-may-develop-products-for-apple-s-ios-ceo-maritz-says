  VMware Inc ., the largest maker of
programs that let computers run multiple operating systems, is
considering developing products for Apple Inc.’s iOS software,
Chief Executive Officer Paul Maritz said.  The Palo Alto, California-based company is developing
software for  Google Inc .’s Android operating system and plans to
begin product trials this year, Maritz said at a briefing in
Tokyo today. He declined to give a specific schedule.  “Android is our first, something that hasn’t been done
before, so we will try it out in that environment and go from
there,” Maritz said. It would be “great if we could have” an
offering for iOS, he said.  The Android product will allow a user to have two phones in
one -- a handset for work and a private line with separate
numbers and operating environments, Maritz said. The company
demonstrated a  prototype  made by LG Electronics Inc. earlier
this month at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona,  Spain .  To contact the reporter on this story:
