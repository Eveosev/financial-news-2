  New Zealand ’s deadliest earthquake
in eight decades may be the costliest natural disaster for
insurers since 2008, according to estimates from JPMorgan Chase
& Co.  Insured losses from the temblor may be $12 billion, Michael Huttner, an analyst at JPMorgan, said in a note to clients. That
would be the most expensive calamity since the $19.9 billion
loss from Hurricane Ike, which struck the U.S. in 2008,
according to the  Insurance Information Institute , a  New York- 
based trade group.  The 6.3-magnitude earthquake struck this week, killing at
least 65 people, toppling buildings and trapping office workers
in Christchurch, New Zealand’s second-largest city. Sidewalks
and roads were destroyed. A 7.0-magnitude temblor shook the city
on Sept. 4, costing insurers an estimated $6 billion, according
to Huttner.  “Even buildings which are still standing may have hidden
structural damage and could then need to be rebuilt,” he said
in the note. “This is a very conservative assumption on our
part and in support of this we note that all reinsurers
revised” cost estimates for the previous earthquake.    Flagstone Reinsurance Holdings SA , the Luxembourg-based
company founded in response to the 2005  hurricane season ,
increased its estimated costs tied to the September quake to
$75.5 million from $52.5 million on Dec. 30. Bermuda-based
reinsurer  PartnerRe Ltd . more than doubled its projection to
between $140 million and $160 million on Dec. 15 from $64
million it had estimated on Nov. 3.  Munich Re , the world’s
largest reinsurer, said the costs from the September quake were
340 million euros ($464 million) on Feb. 3.  Shares Decline  PartnerRe fell $3.44, or 4.2 percent, to $78.66 at 2:10
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. That’s the
biggest drop since April 2009. Flagstone declined 41 cents, or
3.3 percent, to $12.13.  A $12 billion loss from this week’s earthquake would make
it the seventh-most costly natural disaster for insurers since
1970, according to the  Insurance Information Institute ’s
ranking, which is based on data from Swiss Reinsurance Co. and
reflects losses in 2009 U.S. dollars. The industry’s most
expensive catastrophe was 2005’s Hurricane Katrina, which cost
$71.2 billion.  The Chilean earthquake, last year’s most costly disaster,
may cost the industry $8.5 billion according to Aon Corp. and
wasn’t included in the ranking, which ran through 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
