  Apollo Group Inc ., the largest U.S.
for-profit college operator, said U.S. regulators concluded
their review of financial aid programs in 2009-2010 and 2010-
2011 with no adverse findings.  The Department of Education closed its review of how the
University of Phoenix, Apollo’s largest unit, handled Title IV
financial aid funds without imposing economic sanctions, the
company said today in a regulatory filing. For-profit colleges
get as much as 90 percent of their revenue from federal  student
loans  and grants.  Investigators examined the financial aid cases of 30
University of Phoenix students selected at random in December,
according to a Feb. 8 letter from the Education Department to
Apollo. While the investigators found three examples where
Phoenix violated procedures, they concluded the university had
corrected the errors without requiring additional sanctions, the
letter said.  Apollo gained as much as 2.8 percent in extended trading
after declining 9 cents, or less than 1 percent, to $45.73 at
the 4 p.m. New York time close of Nasdaq Stock Market composite
trading. The company’s shares have fallen 21 percent in the last
12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
