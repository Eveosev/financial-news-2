  BP Plc  and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc 
signed memorandums of understanding with Kuwait Petroleum Corp.
covering areas including exploration and refining.  The agreements were sealed in Kuwait City today during a
visit by U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron, who is touring the
Middle East with a delegation of businessmen. Cameron’s
officials were unable to give details of the accords, beyond
saying that Shell had signed two and BP one.  The BP accord covers both new fields inside Kuwait and a
refinery project in China, the company’s managing director for
refining and marketing, Ian Conn, said in an interview. He
refused to put a value on the agreement.  “This builds on other memorandums that we have already in
place,” Conn said. “It’s a commitment to a deeper strategic
cooperation in both Kuwait and other operations outside
Kuwait.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
