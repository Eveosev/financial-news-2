Nigeria registered 67.8 million
voters for elections to be held in April, the  Independent
National Electoral Commission  said.  The official register of voters will be published on March
2, the electoral body said in an e-mailed statement today.
Political parties have until Feb. 28 to change or replace
candidates for political office, it said.  Africa’s most populous country and top oil producer will
hold a presidential election on April 9. President Goodluck Jonathan will run against Muhammadu Buhari, a northern Muslim
and former military ruler who is the candidate for the Congress
for Progressive Change, and Nuhu Ribadu, ex-anti-graft boss and
candidate of the Action Congress of Nigeria.  There will also be a federal legislative vote on April 2
and state elections on April 16.  Elections held in  Nigeria  in 2007 were condemned by local
and international monitors as marred by fraud and violent
intimidation.  “This commission will spare no effort to deliver on its
promise that the elections will be free, fair and credible,”
Chairman Attahiru Jega said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
