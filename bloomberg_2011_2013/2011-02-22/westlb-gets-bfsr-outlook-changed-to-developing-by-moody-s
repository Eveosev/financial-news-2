WestLB AG had some of its credit
rating outlooks changed by Moody’s Investors Service, which
cited the lender’s “more far-reaching downsizing and
restructuring targets.”  The outlook on the bank’s E+ standalone bank financial
strength rating was changed to “developing” from “stable,”
while the outlook on its A3 senior debt and deposit rating was
changed to “developing” from “negative,” Moody’s said in a
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
