  China ’s interest-rate swaps fell the
most in a week on concern political instability in the Middle
East will hinder global economic growth, reducing the need for
borrowing costs to be raised to cool the economy.  The one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate slid five basis
points to 3.94 percent as of 11:57 a.m. in  Shanghai , the biggest
drop since Feb. 14, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Crude oil surged as much as 9.6 percent today to $94.49 a barrel,
the highest level since October 2008, as violence intensified in  Libya , the holder of Africa’s largest oil reserves.  “China’s interest-rate swaps are moving lower along with
all other Asia Pacific curves, as today is all about flight to
quality,” said Wee-Khoon Chong, a fixed-income strategist at
Societe Generale SA in  Hong Kong .  The seven-day repurchase rate, a gauge of the availability
of funds, jumped 18 basis points to 6.26 percent, according to a
daily fixing from the National Interbank Funding Center in
Shanghai. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The rate surged the most since at least 2004 yesterday
after the central bank ordered lenders to set aside more money
as reserves. Banks’ reserve-requirement ratios will climb half a
percentage point effective Feb. 24, the People’s Bank of China
said Feb. 18.  The monetary authority sold 1 billion yuan ($152 million)
of one-year bills today at a yield of 2.9972 percent in open-
market operations, unchanged from the previous sale.  The yield on the government’s 3.77 percent bond due
December 2020 fell three basis points to 4.07 percent, according
to Chinabond, the nation’s biggest debt-clearing house.  Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  said he hadn’t fled the
country as diplomats resigned and soldiers deserted in protest
over a crackdown on anti-government protesters that has left
hundreds dead. Counterparts in Tunisia and Egypt have been
driven from office already this year and there’s also been
political unrest in Algeria, Bahrain,  Iran ,  Morocco  and Yemen.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
