Nikko Cordial Securities Inc., the
investment banking unit of  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc .,
said it bought a 14.9 percent stake in  PetroVietnam Securities
Inc . for 133.7 billion dong ($6.4 million).  Nikko Cordial paid 15,000 dong per share, the Tokyo-based
brokerage said in a statement today. That’s 42 percent higher
than today’s closing price of 10,600 dong.  Nikko will help Hanoi-based PetroVietnam and its group
companies raise funds overseas, the statement said. The two
brokerages aim to work on sales of state-run Vietnamese
companies as well as mergers and acquisitions involving the
nations, and Nikko will send executives to PetroVietnam.  PetroVietnam’s pretax profit climbed 40 percent to 85.7
billion dong last year, the company said in an e-mailed
statement to Bloomberg News late yesterday. Revenue more than
doubled to 258.7 billion dong, it said.  The firm targets pretax profit of 101.4 billion dong this
year and revenue of 352 billion dong, it said in the e-mail.  Nikko Cordial is seeking to expand its investment banking
business overseas. It plans to add 40 bankers to  New York ,
London,  Hong Kong  and Shanghai by March 2012 specializing in
mergers and acquisitions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
