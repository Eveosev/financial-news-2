  Greece  may be unable to sustain
efforts to tackle its debt, forcing a restructuring of bond
payments, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
President Thomas Mirow said in a  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  interview.  “It’s doubtful that Greece can bear a debt ratio of more
than 150 percent for any length of time,” Mirow was cited by
the newspaper as saying. “Markets have priced in a
restructuring for a long time now.”  Mirow said Greece may be able to manage its debt when its
ratio is at 100 percent of gross domestic product.  To contact the reporter on this story:
