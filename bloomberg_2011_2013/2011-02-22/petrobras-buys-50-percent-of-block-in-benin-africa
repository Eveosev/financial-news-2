  Petroleo Brasileiro SA , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil producer, said it acquired a 50 percent
stake in an offshore block in Benin as it expands in Africa.  A unit of Lusitania Petroleum holds the other 50 percent of
Block 4, Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based company is
known, said today in a regulatory filing. Petrobras said it
expects to find light oil at the block Lusitania will operate.  Petrobras has offshore assets in Libya, Nigeria, Angola,
Namibia and Tanzania. The block in Benin spans 7,400 square
kilometers in up to 3,000 meters (9,843 feet) of water.  Petrobras, the world’s largest operator in waters deeper
than 1,000 feet, is exploring for oil in fields in Africa, the
company said. Brazil, Africa and the  Gulf of Mexico  have similar
offshore geology where oil reservoirs are often sealed under a
thick layer of salt below the ocean floor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
