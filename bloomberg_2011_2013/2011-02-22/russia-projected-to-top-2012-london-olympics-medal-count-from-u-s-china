  Russia  will win the most medals at
the 2012 London Olympics ahead of the U.S. and  China , according
to projections from the Australian Olympic Committee, which put
its own team in eighth place overall.  Based on results from world championships, world cups and
other major international events staged in 2010, Russia is
projected to win 97 medals at next year’s Summer Games ahead of
94 for the U.S. and 93 for China, the AOC said.    Great Britain  is fourth, with a projected medal count of 48
medals, followed by  Germany  (47), France (45) and Japan (43).
Australia, which finished in sixth place at the 2008 Beijing
Olympics with 46 medals, will get four fewer at the next
edition, according to the AOC’s 2010 benchmark.  “A top five position is still very achievable,” AOC
President John Coates said in a  statement . “There are five
countries jostling for fourth and fifth spots who are all very
close together.”  A$23 million ($23.1 million) in government funding to elite
sports provided late last year may help lift performances
between now and the start of the London Games in July 2012,
Coates said.  “It took a while coming but it’s kicking in now,” he
said.    Australia  finished fourth overall at the 2000 Sydney
Olympics with 58 medals and fourth again in Athens four years
later with 49 medals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
