China’s investment into  Africa  may
rise by 70 percent to $50 billion by 2015 from 2009, as the
Asian nation seeks to acquire resources,  Standard Bank  Group Ltd.
said.  Bilateral trade between China and Africa will reach $300
billion by 2015, double the 2010 level, Africa’s largest lender
said today in a report.  Companies including Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. and China
National Petroleum Corp. are seeking acquisitions in Africa,
buying  iron ore , oil and copper assets to feed a growing economy.
Africa’s gross domestic product will expand by about 6 percent
annually through 2015, Standard Bank said.  “Trade and investment routes in Africa are being
recalibrated as economic momentum shifts to the East,” George
Fang, China head of mining and metals, said in the report.
“This has been further intensified by the turmoil in advanced
economies and has been exemplified by sovereign debt challenges
across  Europe .”  China is adding infrastructure capacity to link resources
in African countries, which “will make investment viable while
leaving a future economic legacy” for African nations, Fang
said.  --Xiao Yu. Editors: Alan Soughley, Indranil Ghosh  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
