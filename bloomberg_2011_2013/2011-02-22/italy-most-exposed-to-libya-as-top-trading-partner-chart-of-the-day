  Italy ’s trading ties with Libya make
it the most exposed European Union country to any collapse in
Muammar Qaddafi’s regime.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows that Italy bought 49 percent of
Libya’s exports to the 27-nation EU in 2009 and was responsible
for 39 percent of the bloc’s sales to the North African country,
according to Eurostat, the EU’s Luxembourg-based statistics
office. Germany bought 14 percent of Libyan exports.  Italy’s ties with Libya, which it occupied from 1911 to
1943, have strengthened under Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi .
In 2008, it forged a treaty that paved the way for 25 billion
euros ($34 billion) in Eni SpA oil projects in  Libya . Investment
links also go the other way, with Libyan stakes in UniCredit
SpA, Italy’s biggest bank, totalling 7.6 percent.  “Italy is first in the firing line,” said James Walston,
who teaches politics at the American University in Rome. “His
friend seems to be in trouble, but Berlusconi does not want to
‘bother’ Qaddafi.”  Libya, holder of Africa’s largest oil reserves, is the
latest country in the region to be rocked by protests ignited by
the ouster of Tunisia’s president last month and spurred by the
fall of Egypt’s President  Hosni Mubarak  on Feb. 11. One of
Qaddafi’s sons, Saif al-Islam, warned on Feb. 20 of the risk of
civil war.  To contact the reporters on this story:
