Christos Bagios, a Credit Suisse
private banker, has been charged in the U.S. with conspiracy and
fraud in connection with a federal investigation into offshore
accounts, the  New York  Times reported, citing two unidentified
people briefed on the matter.  Bagios, a Greek national, was arrested in New York and
transferred to  Fort Lauderdale , Florida, the newspaper said. His
incarceration indicates that the Justice Department has
intensified its investigations into the use of offshore private
banking accounts to avoid U.S. taxes, the Times added.  David Walker, a spokesman for Credit Suisse, declined to
comment, the newspaper said.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
