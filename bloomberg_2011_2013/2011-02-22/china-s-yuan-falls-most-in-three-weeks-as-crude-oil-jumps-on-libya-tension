  China ’s yuan fell the most in three
weeks as political instability in the Middle East drove oil
prices higher, boosting import costs and spurring concern the
global economic recovery will slow.  China imported 54 percent of the crude oil it used in 2010,
according to the China Petroleum and Chemical Industry
Association. Crude for April delivery surged as much as 9.8
percent, the highest level since October 2008, after violence
erupted in  Libya , holder of Africa’s largest oil reserves.
Chinese authorities set the yuan’s daily reference rate weaker
for the first time in six days.  “Events in the Middle East may weigh on the global
economy,” said  Frances Cheung , a senior strategist at Credit
Agricole CIB in  Hong Kong . “Investors are more risk averse.
It’s not a surprise that the People’s Bank of China will be more
cautious on the yuan.”  The yuan slid 0.21 percent to 6.5803 per dollar as of 16:32
in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. It touched 6.5654 yesterday, the strongest level since
China unified official and market exchange rates at the end of
1993. The central bank set the reference rate at 6.5772, 0.1
percent weaker than yesterday.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.26 percent to
6.4325, reflecting bets the currency will strengthen 2.3 percent
in a year’s time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi said he hadn’t fled the
country as diplomats resigned and soldiers deserted in protest
over a crackdown on anti-government protesters that has left
hundreds dead. Counterparts in Tunisia and  Egypt  have been
driven from office this year and there’s been political unrest
in Algeria, Bahrain, Iran, Morocco and Yemen.  --Fion Li, Lilian Karunungan, Ying Wang. Editors: James Regan,
