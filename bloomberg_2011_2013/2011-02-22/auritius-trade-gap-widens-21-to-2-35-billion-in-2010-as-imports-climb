Mauritius’s trade deficit widened by
21 percent in 2010 compared with a year earlier as imports rose
more than exports, the country’s statistics agency said.  The gap increased to 68.4 billion rupees ($2.35 billion)
last year from 56.5 billion rupees, the Port Louis-based Central
Statistics Office said in a statement on its website today.
Total exports rose by 8.6 percent to 67.1 billion rupees and
imported climbed 15 percent to 135.5 billion rupees, it said.  “It’s the outcome of higher fuel bills and rising food
prices,” Eric Ng, an economist and director of the advisory
company, PluriConseil, said by phone from  Port Louis , the
capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
