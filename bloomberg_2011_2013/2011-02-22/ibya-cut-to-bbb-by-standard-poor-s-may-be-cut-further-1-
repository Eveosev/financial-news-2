Libya’s sovereign credit rating was
cut by one level at  Standard & Poor’s  Ratings Services, which
noted that it may be reduced further as violence escalated and
the government warned of civil war.  S&P cut the long-term rating of Libya, the holder of
Africa’s largest oil reserves, to BBB+, the third lowest
investment grade and affirmed the short-term ratings at A-2, the
third highest investment grade.  “We expect that the violent outbreaks of civil unrest seen
in Libya’s eastern region, and particularly the city of
Benghazi, of the past few days will persist,” the ratings
company said in an e-mailed statement today.  Clashes between protesters and security forces have left
more than 200 people dead in the past week, according to  Human
Rights Watch . The unrest followed popular uprisings that led to
the toppling of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and
Egypt’s  Hosni Mubarak . Demonstrators have also taken to the
streets in Bahrain, Yemen, Morocco and Iran.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
