  Colt Group SA , a U.K.
telecommunications company controlled by  Fidelity Investments ,
is getting closer to buying MarketPrizm, a trading technology
company, the Financial Times reported, citing two unidentified
people familiar with the matter.  MarketPrizm is part of the Chi-X Global trading platform
and was put on the market last year by Instinet Group Inc., its
majority shareholder, the newspaper said.  Colt hopes to announce an agreement when it posts full-year
financial results on Feb. 25, the FT said.  The company said it doesnâ€™t comment on speculation, the
newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
