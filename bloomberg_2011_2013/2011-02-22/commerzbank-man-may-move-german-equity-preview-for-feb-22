Most German stocks retreated as a
decline in  Siemens AG  offset gains in automobile shares.  Siemens declined 1.3 percent.  Pfleiderer AG  fell 2.5
percent after being downgraded at WestLB AG. Daimler AG rose 1.6
percent, snapping five days of declines.  The benchmark DAX Index dropped 0.1 percent to 7,318.35 at
the 5:30 p.m. close in Frankfurt, after earlier sliding as much
as 0.9 percent. Eight stocks fell for every seven that rose.
Even so, the measure has gained 5.9 percent this year amid
optimism that the global economic recovery is gathering
strength. The broader  HDAX Index  also slipped 0.1 percent today.  “Concern stemming from the political unrest in the Middle
East and North Africa prompted a correction that was somehow
expected to take place at some point,” Giorgio Mascherone,
chief investment officer at  Deutsche Bank AG  in Milan, said. He
added that “fundamentals remain very good.”  Siemens, Europe’s largest engineering company, lost 1.3
percent to 95.53 euros.  Pfleiderer fell 2.5 percent to 1.55 euros. WestLB AG
downgraded the German maker of laminate flooring to “neutral”
from “add,” saying in a note it considers “upside potential
for equity owners as less likely in the short- to medium-term.”  DAB Bank AG sank 7.5 percent to 4.55 euros as the German
online broker controlled by Italy’s UniCredit SpA reported lower
full-year profit.  Net income declined to 16.4 million euros ($22.4 million)
in 2010 from 23.3 million euros in 2009, the Munich-based
company said in a statement, citing preliminary figures. Pretax
profit of 28.6 million euros matched the firm’s target to
generate “significantly more than 25 million euros.”  Kabel Deutschland Drops    Kabel Deutschland Holding AG  slid 1.2 percent to 38.77
euros as the company’s nine-month net loss widened to 45.1
million euros, while revenue increased.  Daimler increased 1.6 percent to 53.05 euros.    MAN SE  gained 2.5 percent to 88.56 euros. MAN’s top
executive in the Diesel & Turbo unit resigned today amid a
bribery probe as Europe’s third-largest truckmaker battles
investigations of price fixing and other potential violations.    Aareal Bank AG  jumped 9.1 percent to 25.10 euros. The
company said it’s “confident” that it will generate more
operating profit in 2011 than in 2010, though it’s impossible to
forecast net trading income and expenses. Aareal Bank also said
fourth-quarter consolidated operating profit rose to 40 million
euros from 23 million euros a year earlier.    MorphoSys AG  gained 1.5 percent to 19.90 euros as the
biotechnology company received a milestone payment from Novartis
AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
