Vietnamese bonds fell for a second
day, sending yields to the highest level in more than eight
months, after a government official said this yearâ€™s inflation
target of 7 percent will be difficult to meet. The dong dropped.  An increase of 15.3 percent in average electricity prices
starting March 1 will add 0.76 percentage point to gains in the
consumer-price index, the Thoi Bao Kinh Te Vietnam newspaper
reported, citing Nguyen Tien Thoa, the head of price control at
the Ministry of Finance. Monthly inflation accelerated in Hanoi
and  Ho Chi Minh City  in February, online newswire VnEconomy
reported yesterday.  The yield on three-year notes rose five basis points to
11.18 percent, the highest level since June 11, as of 2:50 p.m.
in Hanoi, according to a daily fixing rate from banks compiled
by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. The yield
on five-year bonds was 11.54 percent, compared wwith 11.53
percent yesterday.  Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung will sign a resolution
tomorrow directing the central bank and ministries to curb
inflation by tightening monetary and fiscal policy, said Le Xuan Nghia, vice-chairman of the National Financial Supervisory
Commission. Dung will also approve lowering the target for
credit growth this year to about 20 percent from 23 percent,
Nghia said today.  The dong dropped 0.2 percent to 20,880 per dollar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It traded between
22,000 and 22,130 at gold shops in Ho Chi Minh City, compared
with between 22,100 and 22,230 yesterday, according to a
telephone-directory information service run by the state-owned
Vietnam Posts & Telecommunications.  The central bank set the  reference rate  at 20,678, compared
with 20,673 yesterday. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1
percent on either side of the rate.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
