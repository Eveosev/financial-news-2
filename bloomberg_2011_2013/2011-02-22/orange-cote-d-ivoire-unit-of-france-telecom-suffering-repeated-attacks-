Orange Cote d’Ivoire, a unit of  France Telecom SA , said “repeated attacks” on its technical
network were disrupting mobile, landline and internet services
in the  Ivory Coast .  “These attacks largely consist of the cutting of
transmission cables for communications traffic,” the operator
said in a statement published in the Abidjan-based Fraternité-
Matin newspaper today.  “The competent authorities have been informed of these
acts of sabotage,” said the Ivory Coast’s biggest telecoms
operator. It didn’t give any further details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
