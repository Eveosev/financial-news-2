Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero urged  Europe  to lend economic and political
support to back the creation of new democracies in the Middle
East and North Africa,  Reuters  reported, citing an interview.  “We are probably witnessing a wave of new democracies
being born,” Zapatero said in the interview published today.
“We want democracy. We want reforms. We don’t want violence. We
condemn it.”  He also said that Morocco is different from other countries
in the region as it has a multi-party system, the news agency
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
