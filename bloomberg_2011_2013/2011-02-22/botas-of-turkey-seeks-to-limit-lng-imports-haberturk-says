Boru Hatlari Ile Petrol Tasima AS,  Turkey ’s state-owned pipeline company known as Botas, has asked
the country’s energy regulator to limit imports of liquefied
natural gas to avoid fines on gas imports,  Haberturk  said.  Botas wants to avoid having to pay Russia and  Iran , which
supply piped gas to Turkey, for any unused gas under the so-
called take-or-pay clause in the gas purchase contracts, the
newspaper said, without saying where it got the information.  The regulator turned down Botas’s request, saying the law
that allows private licensed companies to import LNG, bought
mostly from Algeria and  Nigeria , must be amended for any LNG
import restriction, the paper said.  Turkey consumed 37.4 billion cubic meters of piped gas in
2010 and imported LNG equivalent to 3 billion cubic meters,
according to the paper. Turkey will pay Russia as much as $1.3
billion for the untapped gas it should have bought under the
contract in 2010, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
