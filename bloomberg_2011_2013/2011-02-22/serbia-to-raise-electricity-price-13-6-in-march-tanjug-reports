Serbian government will allow a 13.6
percent increase in electricity prices as of March 1,
overlooking concerns that it would fuel inflation, state-run
 Tanjug  newswire reported, citing the country’s  power monopoly 
and the central bank governor.  Elektroprivreda Srbije has already changed its 2011
business plan counting on government approval of higher prices
this week, while the National bank of Serbia’s governor, Dejan Soskic, called for postponement until at least April 1 to avoid
the pressure on  Serbia ’s already double-digit inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
