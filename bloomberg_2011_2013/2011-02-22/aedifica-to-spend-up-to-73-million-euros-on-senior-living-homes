  Aedifica  SA agreed to buy five
senior living homes in  Belgium  from Soprim@ NV for 23 million
euros ($31 million) and will spend as much as 50 million euros
on renovation, expansion and construction at the sites.  Soprim@  will manage the homes on 27-year leases and obtain
an option to buy the properties back at the expiration dates,
Brussels-based Aedifica said today in an e-mailed statement. The
real-estate investment fund forecast an initial rental yield of
about 6 percent on the transaction, including the expansion and
construction projects that are scheduled for completion starting
at the end of next year and ending by mid-2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
