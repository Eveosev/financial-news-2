  Q-Cells SE , a German solar company,
slumped as much as 6.6 percent in Frankfurt trading after the
company reported 2010 full-year earnings.  “We believe that 2011 will look more challenging,” Stefan
Freudenreich and Sebastian Growe, Frankfurt-based analysts at
Equinet AG, wrote in a report today. “The stock does not offer
any upside after the recent outperformance versus peers.” The
brokerage reiterated its “hold” recommendation on the stock.  Q-Cells shares declined 1.8 percent to 3.25 euros as of
9:35 a.m. local time.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
