Copper dropped for a second day in  London  on concern a rally in  oil prices  will boost inflation and
support the case for further tightening in China, the world’s
largest consumer. All six LME metals declined, led by zinc.  Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange declined as
much as 1.6 percent to $9,655 per metric ton, and traded at
$9,672.25 at 3:28 p.m. in Singapore. The metal also fell as
equities retreated and the dollar strengthened against a basket
of six major currencies.  “In the near term, the rally in oil prices is definitely
raising concerns about inflation and what this means for
monetary policy not just in China but the U.S. as well,” Song
Huaibing, an analyst at Ahcof Futures Co., said from Anhui.    China ’s central bank on Feb. 18 announced an increase in
reserve requirement ratios for a second time this year, 10 days
after it raised  interest rates  for a third time in four months.
The U.S. Federal Reserve has left its key rate at zero to 0.25
percent since December to support the economy.  Oil jumped to the highest level in more than two years,
while Asian stocks fell for a second day as violence escalated
in  Libya , stoking concern the global recovery may be hampered as
turmoil spreads through the Middle East and North Africa.  May-delivery copper on the Shanghai Futures Exchange lost
as much as 1.8 percent to 73,720 yuan ($11,205) a ton, while
zinc dropped as much as 6.2 percent, the most since Nov. 15.
Copper futures in  New York  fell as much as 1.2 percent to
$4.4420 a pound.  “Short-term risks include rising inventories and how the
rest of the financial markets respond to geopolitical
tensions,” said Yang Zhenqiang, an analyst at First Futures
Brokerage Co.  Rising Stockpiles  Stockpiles tallied by the London Metal Exchange rose for a
sixth day yesterday to 411,475 tons, the highest level since
August. Inventories monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange
jumped to a nine-month high of 161,062 tons last week.  “We view the recent gains in inventories as temporary and
still expect the world to be short of copper as Chinese demand
starts to pick up as we head into the peak period,” said Song.  Demand for copper in China is not slowing down even as the
government attempts to cool the economy, Chile’s Mining and
Energy Minister  Laurence Golborne  said. “Even with increasing
inventories prices have remained firm,” Golborne said in an
interview yesterday.  Chile  is the largest copper producer.  Refined-copper output is expected to gain 1.1 percent to
about 19.3 million tons this year, while usage may grow 4.5
percent to 19.7 million tons, resulting in a 435,000-ton
shortfall, according to the International Copper Study Group.  Zinc in London fell 2.7 percent to $2,526 a ton, lead shed
1.7 percent to $2,628.50 ton and nickel dropped 0.8 percent to
$29,062 a ton. Tin declined 1.1 percent to $31,980 a ton, and
aluminum lost 0.9 percent to $2,557.25 a ton. Aluminum reached a
two-year high yesterday on concern that unrest in the Middle
East will disrupt supplies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
