Peruvian sugar producer Empresa
Agroindustrial Pomalca SA jumped the most since September on
speculation a government transfer of shares to workers may lead
to a takeover bid for the company.  Pomalca surged 14 percent to 67 centimos at 4:10 p.m. New
York time, the biggest gain since Sept. 10.  The government will transfer shares in sugar producers
including Pomalca to workers owed money by the companies, Mario
Gonzalez, the director of state financing company Fonafe, said
today in an interview with Lima-based  Radio Programas .  The measure may lead an investor to make an offer to
acquire a majority stake in the company, said Arlen Lahura, a
trader at Lima-based brokerage Coril SAB.  “If the state transfers its Pomalca shares to the workers,
a majority of the shares will be in the hands of third
parties,” Lahura said. “It may allow a big investor to come in
and make a bid for them.”  The transfer of the government’s stake will give 3,500
workers and retirees control of about 45 percent of Pomalca’s
shares, said Pedro Luyando, a company spokesman, in a phone
interview. Once the workers receive the shares, they will be
unable to sell them for at least two years, he said.  The government measure will “reduce the debt the company
owes to its workers,” said Luyando. “No one is talking about
the sale of shares to a third party.”  Pomalca employees now hold about 12 percent of the
company’s shares, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
