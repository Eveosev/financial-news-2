  Stuart Gulliver ,  HSBC Holdings Plc 
chief executive officer, is not employed directly by the bank’s
main holding company, the Guardian reported. His contract, which
the newspaper said it has seen, is with a Dutch-based company,
HSBC Asia Holdings, the Guardian said. HSBC said all its more
than 400 international managers have their contracts through the
same subsidiary, and that “there is no tax benefit involved,”
the newspaper said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
