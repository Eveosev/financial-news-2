Sulfurcell Solartechnik GmbH , a
Berlin-based manufacturer of thin-film solar panels, is seeking
a strategic partner to help it expand production capacity by
more than seven-fold.  The company has raised 150 million euros ($205 million),
including about 30 million euros in government incentives,
Kalman Kaufman, chairman of the supervisory board, said in a Tel
Aviv interview at a Landmark Ventures business conference
yesterday.  “To be really efficient you need hundreds of megawatts,”
Kaufman said. A potential partner can be found "probably in the  Far East  where the cost of labor is lower and there is more
capital in this area.’’  Sulfurcell is planning to expand to between 200 and 300
megawatts of annual production from 40 megawatts in 2011, he
said.  About 1,700 megawatts in thin-film panels were produced in
2010, a majority of which were by U.S. manufacturer  First Solar
Inc ., Bloomberg New Energy Finance has estimated.  Thin-film, developed as a cheaper alternative to the
traditional solar panels from silicon, uses photovoltaic
materials that are deposited in sheets onto surfaces such as for
roof shingles or building blocks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
