Czech economic sentiment worsened to
the lowest rate in three months in February as businesses
registered weaker demand and consumers expected a deterioration
of their financial situation.  The composite indicator of business and consumer confidence
fell to 9 from 10.5 in January, the Prague-based statistics
office  said  in a statement on its website today. The business-
confidence indicator dropped to 14.1 from 15.6, while the gauge
for consumers decreased to minus 11.5 from minus 9.8.  The confidence indicators may range from minus 100, if all
respondents are pessimistic, to 100, if all are optimistic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
