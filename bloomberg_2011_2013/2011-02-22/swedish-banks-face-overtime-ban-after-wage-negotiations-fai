Swedish banks and asset managers
won’t be allowed to let staff work overtime starting next month
after the industry’s biggest union and employers failed to agree
on wages.  The ban, effective March 5 and applicable to all 30,000
workers represented by the  Financial Sector Union of Sweden ,
will be accompanied by a hiring freeze, union Vice Chairwoman
Ulrika Boethius said today by phone from Stockholm. The measures
may be extended to a ban on overseas business travel for all
members as of March 11, she said. The union represents staff at
lenders such as  Nordea Bank AB  and SEB AB.  The agreement failed because of differing views on the
level of the wage increases that would be guaranteed in the
collective bargaining agreement, Gunilla Grenoe, chief executive
officer of the Employers Association of the Swedish Banking
Institutions, known as BAO, said by phone. The parties were able
to agree on “a simplified model” for work-hour planning,
according to an e-mailed statement from the group.  “BAO is prepared to strive for an agreement that has the
same content and levels that apply to the labour market in
general,” Grenoe said. BAO’s members include 143 companies in
areas such as banking, asset management and  life insurance .  The collective bargaining agreement between BAO and the
Financial Sector Union expired Dec. 1 and has since been running
on a temporary basis with a two-week notice period. The
Financial Sector Union gave notice on Feb. 18. The parties
aren’t currently planning to resume negotiations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
