  Barclays Plc ’s unit in Ghana will
end offshore banking within six months after the country’s
government didn’t put in place laws needed to make the financial
system work.  The lender, which got Ghana’s first offshore banking
license in September 2007, opened 200 accounts and couldn’t do
much else, Benjamin Debrah, managing director of  Barclays Bank 
of Ghana Ltd., told reporters in Accra, the capital, today.  “The country currently does not have the legislative
framework and tax reforms to allow the smooth operation of an
international financial services centre,” he said.  Bank of Ghana Governor Kwesi Amissah-Arthur on Feb. 18 said
the government is no longer interested in attracting investment
to the country through offshore banking, which allows foreigners
not resident in  Ghana  to open bank accounts here.  “The legislation is currently not in place and there are
concerns with Ghana’s money laundering posture,” he told
reporters at a meeting of the central bank’s Monetary Policy
Committee.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
