OPEC has assured oil consumers of
adequate supply in the event of a disruption caused by the
unrest in the Middle East, the executive director of the  International Energy Agency  said.  Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ Secretary-
General Abdalla el-Badri assured that the producer group will
meet any possible disruption through its spare capacity,  Nobuo Tanaka  said today in Riyadh,  Saudi Arabia . The oil market is
“very well-supplied” with OPEC production at current levels
and it doesn’t need more crude, Tanaka said.  The Paris-based  agency  said there was no need to supply the
market with more oil and that it was monitoring the spreading
Middle East unrest closely following the events in Libya.  “The IAE stands ready, as always, to make oil available to
the market in the event of a major supply disruption if
alternative supplies cannot readily be made available via normal
market mechanisms,” it said in a  statement  on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
