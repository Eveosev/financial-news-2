Cavalli Group, the Italian fashion
company that dressed actress Kate Hudson at the Grammy Awards,
said it was more profitable in 2010, even as sales declined
because of fewer royalties and the disposal of some businesses.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization as a percentage of sales widened to more than 14
percent from 11.7 percent a year earlier, the Florence-based
company said today in an e-mailed statement. Net income was
“positive,” Cavalli said, without providing figures.  Revenue fell 6 percent to 176.2 million euros ($241
million), hurt by a 27 percent drop in royalties and disposal
of “non-strategic” businesses, the owner of the  Roberto
Cavalli  and Just Cavalli brands said, without elaborating.
Excluding royalties, sales increased 7 percent, the company
said.  Cavalli reorganized its license portfolio in 2010, renewing
nine contracts and adding eight others, including a fragrance
deal with Coty Inc., the fashion company said. The maker of
$1,745 leopard print chiffon dresses also signed an agreement
with Lebanon-based Pragma Group to open five new branded clubs
and 15 branded cafes. The outlook for 2011 is “promising,”
Chief Executive Officer Gianluca Brozzetti said last month.  Full-year sales at Cavalli’s own stores increased 28
percent, boosted by the opening of 7 new outlets and a new e-
commerce site, the company said today. Cavalli will add 15 new
single-brand boutiques this year, around half of which will be
fully owned, Brozzetti said in January. The company had 135 so-
called monobrand stores at the end of 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Andrew Roberts  in Paris at
