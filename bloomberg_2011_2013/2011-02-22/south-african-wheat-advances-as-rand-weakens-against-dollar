Wheat advanced in  South Africa  as
the rand weakened against the dollar, making imports more
expensive for local millers.  The rand traded at 7.2157 to the dollar at 12:14 p.m. in
Johannesburg, compared with 7.1447 at the close of grain trading
at noon yesterday.  Wheat for March delivery, the most active contract, gained
40 rand, or 1.2 percent, to close at 3,283 rand ($454) a metric
ton on the South African Futures Exchange.  White corn for July delivery rose 7 rand, or 0.4 percent,
to 1,653 rand a ton. Meal made from the grain is South Africaâ€™s
staple food.  Yellow corn for July delivery climbed 6 rand, or 0.4
percent, to 1,692 rand a ton. The grain is mainly used as  animal
feed  in South Africa.  Gains or losses for the most active contracts of three
additional crops today are as follows. All prices are in rand,
and the crops are sold in tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
