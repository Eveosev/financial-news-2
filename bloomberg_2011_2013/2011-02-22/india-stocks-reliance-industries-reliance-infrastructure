Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in  India  trading. Stock symbols are in

declined 142.15, or 0.8 percent, to 18,296.16.  State-run refiners: Indian Oil Corp. (IOCL IN) fell 4
percent to 305.05 rupees, its lowest since May. Bharat Petroleum
Corp. (BPCL IN) declined 3.3 percent to 570.25 rupees, and
Hindustan Petroleum Corp. (HPCL IN) lost 4.5 percent to 321.9
rupees. The three refiners fell after oil jumped to the highest
in more than two years on spreading turmoil in the Middle East
and North Africa.    Cairn India Ltd . (CAIR IN), the operator of India’s biggest
onshore oilfield, rose 3.5 percent to 330.25 rupees, after crude

in Marvel Resorts Pvt. for as much as 540 million rupees,
according to a statement to the stock exchange.    Kingfisher Airlines Ltd . (KAIR IN) lost 4.2 percent to

start selling global depositary receipts to raise as much as
$350 million until its stock recovers and market conditions
improve, the Mint newspaper said today, citing two people
familiar with the matter.  Kingfisher Airlines later said it had “neither confirmed
nor announced” any changes in plans to raise funds by selling
global depository receipts.  The carrier is unable to say when the GDR sale will take
place because of regulatory requirements, it said in an e-mailed
response to Bloomberg News questions.    Reliance Industrial Infrastructure Ltd . (RIIL IN) surged 18
percent to 705.6 rupees, the most since July, as investors bet
the pipeline operator will get more business after its parent,  Reliance Industries Ltd ., formed a venture with BP Plc.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL IN) increased 3 percent to
984.85 rupees, its steepest gain since Dec. 10. India’s largest
company by market value agreed to sell stakes in 23 areas to BP
