  Delta Air Lines Inc . call volume
jumped as the world’s second-largest carrier tumbled in intraday
trading to its lowest price since September after oil surged
amid intensifying violence in  Libya .  An investor bought 1,500 March $11 calls and the same
number of March $12 calls, according to a report by New York-
based Trade Alert LLC, a provider of options-market analytics.
Each trade cost 63 cents, Bloomberg data show.  More than 31,000 calls to buy Delta changed hands as of
1:49 p.m. in New York, four times the four-week average and 3.7
times the number of puts to sell. The most-traded contracts were
the September $12 calls, which accounted for more than one-third
of all call volume and dropped 17 percent to $1. Atlanta-based
Delta slid 7.4 percent to $10.66.  Delta declined 15 percent in the past year, compared with a
2.7 percent increase for the Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index.
Gasoline for March delivery added 7.36 cents, or 2.9 percent, to
$2.6249 a gallon at 11:25 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Prices touched $2.681, the highest level for the
front-month contract since Sept. 25, 2008. Futures rose more
than 5 percent.  Delta’s implied volatility, the key gauge of option prices,
for at-the-money options expiring in 30 days jumped to 46.86
from 37.96 Feb. 18.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
