  Drax Group Plc , owner of western  Europe ’s largest coal-fired power station, said its carbon-
dioxide emissions rose 13 percent last year after it produced
more electricity during a colder-than-usual winter.  The 4,000-megawatt plant in Yorkshire, northern  England ,
required emissions permits to cover 12.9 million metric tons of
CO2 last year, the company said today in a  statement . That
compares with 10.3 million the previous year. Both are in
addition to 9.5 million allocated for free.  Drax is covered under the European Union’s emissions
trading program, the world’s biggest. It has an annual cap of
9.5 million tons of CO2 in the years through 2012 and must buy
permits to cover any excess. Drax will have to purchase
allowances to cover all of its emissions from 2013, the third
phase of the EU program.  Drax said it paid an average of 12.60 pounds ($20.38) a
metric ton for emissions permits last year, compared with 14.30
pounds a year earlier. This reflected a trading strategy of
buying permits when it sells power in advance, to protect
against falls in electricity prices, Drax said in the statement.  EU permits for December 2010 traded from 12.25 euros to
16.73 euros a ton with an average of 14.47 euros last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
