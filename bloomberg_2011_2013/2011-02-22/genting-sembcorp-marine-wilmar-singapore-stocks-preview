  Singapore ’s  Straits Times Index  fell
0.3 percent to 3,008.82 as of the 12:30 p.m. trading break.
Almost two stocks dropped for each that rose in the benchmark
index of 30 companies.  Shares on the measure trade at an average 13.8 times
estimated earnings, compared with about 15.6 times at the end of
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The following shares were among the most active in the
market. Stock symbols are in parentheses after the company name.    Genting Singapore Plc  (GENS SP), operator of one of two
casino resorts in the city, declined 2.5 percent to S$1.93. The
company said it had full-year net income of S$37.8 million,
compared with a net loss of S$278 million a year ago. That
missed the S$615 million average profit estimate of 22 analysts
compiled by Bloomberg.    Olam International Ltd . (OLAM SP), a supplier of
agricultural commodities, fell 1.5 percent to S$2.59, extending
its decline to a fourth day as a company statement failed to
stem a plunge that began as CLSA Asia Pacific Markers raised
concerns about its accounting and Nigerian earnings. Olam said a
CLSA report overstated the importance of Nigerian export
incentives to its earnings    SembCorp Marine Ltd . (SMM SP), the world’s second-biggest
builder of oil rigs, lost 0.6 percent to S$5.18 ahead of the
release of its fourth-quarter earnings today. The company is
expected to report net income of S$171 million, according to the
average estimate of four analysts compiled by Bloomberg. That
compares with S$297 million a year ago.    Wilmar International Ltd . (WIL SP), the world’s largest
palm-oil trader, sank 4.3 percent to S$5.18. The company said
fourth-quarter net income fell to $318.6 million from $442
million a year ago. That compares with $391.8 million average
estimate of four analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
