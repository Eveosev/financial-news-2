Georgia’s central bank should avoid
“moving too fast” to tighten monetary policy because inflation
may slow by the end of the year, according to the  International
Monetary Fund .  “Commodity and energy prices will stabilize, and if
inflation doesn’t spread to other sectors we expect it to
decline in the second half of the year and reach about 8 percent
by December,” Edward Gardner, the IMF’s senior resident
representative in Georgia, said in an interview in the capital
Tbilisi today.  The central bank raised its benchmark refinancing rate on
Feb. 16 to 8 percent from 7.5 percent after annual consumer-
price growth rose to 12.3 percent last month. The regulator
increased borrowing costs because of its concerns about
“imported inflation,” according to Gardner.  “The current level of the rate seems appropriate,”
Gardner said. “But moving too fast toward monetary tightening
without evidence that inflation is spreading will be
dangerous.”    Georgia ’s government plans to slow inflation below 10
percent by the third quarter of this year, Vera Kobalia, the
economy and sustainable development minister, said last month.  Gardner also said Georgia’s foreign direct investment
probably reached $600 million in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
