Russia’s state-owned railway, the
biggest corporate issuer of ruble bonds, is turning to the
sterling market for the first time to access new investors as
the country increases spending before the soccer  World Cup .  OAO Russian Railways, which sold a debut $1.5 billion bond
in the U.S. currency last year as well as 30 billion rubles ($1
billion) of domestic debt, plans to raise at least 1 billion
pounds ($1.6 billion) this year, Chief Executive Officer
Vladimir Yakunin said in an interview on Feb. 16.  Russia, which beat  England ’s bid to host the World Cup in
2018, needs to spend as much as 5.5 trillion rubles to connect
five of the 13 host cities with high-speed rail links, Deputy
Finance Minister Alexander Novak said on Feb. 17. Borrowing in
pounds is the most expensive relative to dollars since July
2009, based on yields for 2013 bonds in both currencies sold by
gas monopoly OAO Gazprom,  Russia ’s biggest company.  “As London is probably the world’s largest financial
center, there must be demand for Russian risk in British
currency,” Dmitry Dudkin, head of fixed-income research in
Moscow at UralSib Financial Corp., said yesterday. “This demand
is most likely to be higher than that for ruble Eurobonds.”  While Yakunin said the pound offers the “best terms for
borrowing,” U.K. yields are higher than for dollar and euro
debt as British inflation runs at twice the central bank’s
target. Benchmark 10-year U.K. government bonds yielded 3.69
percent at 3:45 p.m. in London today, 18 basis points, or 0.18
percentage point, more than Treasuries and 53 basis points more
than German bunds.  Higher Cost  Bonds due in 2013 sold by Gazprom in 2007 -- the last year
of sales of securities in pounds from Brazil, Russia,  India  or  China  -- yielded 4.191 percent today. That is 101 basis points
more than dollar-denominated notes due the same year, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  “We doubt that Russian Railways will get much funding cost
optimization by issuing pound notes,”  Stanislav Ponomarenko , an
analyst at Troika Dialog in Moscow, said by e-mail on Feb. 21.  Sterling bonds of  Petroleos Mexicanos , the Mexican state-
owned  oil company , due in 2022 yielded 6.248 percent today, 67
basis points more than its dollar bonds maturing in December
2023, according to prices on Bloomberg. The company has the same
debt rating as Russian Railways, at BBB by  Standard & Poor’s .  ‘Tough to Place’  “Appetite for  Russian Railways  should be okay, but 1
billion pounds would be extremely tough to place,” Sergey Dergachev, who helps manage $8.5 billion of emerging-market debt
at Union Investment Privatfonds in  Frankfurt , said Feb. 17.
“This issue will be rather illiquid and in very tight hands. It
is not something I would have a look at.”  Emerging-market issuers sold $14.8 billion of British
pound-denominated bonds in the past decade, dwarfed by $316.7
billion of debt in euros and $1.25 trillion of dollar notes,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Russian debt
rather than U.S. Treasuries rose 9 basis points to 185,
according to JPMorgan EMBI+ Indexes. That compares with 138 for
debt of similarly rated  Mexico  and 182 for  Brazil , which is
rated two steps lower at Baa3 by Moody’s.  The so-called yield spread on Russian bonds is 85 basis
points below the average for emerging markets, down from a 15-
month high of 105 in February, according to JPMorgan Indexes.  Ruble, Swaps  The ruble slid 33 percent to 29.2680 per dollar at the end
of trading in Moscow. Non-deliverable forwards, which provide a
guide to expectations of currency movements, show the ruble at
29.4635 in three months. Russia’s dollar bonds due in 2020 rose,
pushing the yield down 2 basis point to 5.108 percent.  The cost of protecting Russian debt against non-payment for
five years using credit-default swaps increased 7 basis points
to 157.83, down from last year’s peak of 217, according to data
provider CMA. The swaps for Russia, rated Baa1 by Moody’s
Investors Service, its third-lowest investment grade, cost 24
points less for  Turkey , which is rated four levels lower at Ba2.
Russia swaps cost as much as 40 points less on April 20.  Russian Railways, which sold 7.8 percent of all company
bonds issued in Russia since January 2005, intends to maintain
its spending program in 2011 at a level “not lower” than 350
billion rubles, according to Yakunin.  The company’s investment plan, approved by the government
on Dec. 1, amounted to an annual increase of 11 percent, Economy
Minister  Elvira Nabiullina  said that day.  There isn’t much debt in pounds out there, so this issue
“can find demand,” Elena Kolchina, who helps manage $1.5
billion of assets as head of fixed-income products at
Renaissance Asset Managers in Moscow, said by e-mail on Feb. 17.  “There are just a few Russian credits available in
currencies different from the dollar,” she said. “In the U.K.,
there are many institutional clients who might be interested.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
