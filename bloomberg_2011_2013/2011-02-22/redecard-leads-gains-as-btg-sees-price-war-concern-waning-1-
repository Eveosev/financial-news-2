  Redecard SA , Brazil’s second-biggest
card-payment processor by market value, led gains on the
benchmark Bovespa index after Banco BTG Pactual SA lifted its
rating, citing diminished prospects for a “price war.”  Redecard rose 3.4 percent to 21.89 reais, the highest price
since Dec. 8, at the close of trading in Sao Paulo at 4:15 p.m.
New York time. Larger competitor  Cielo SA  advanced 1.1 percent
to 13.30 reais as the Bovespa slid 1.2 percent.  BTG boosted the companies to “buy” from “neutral,”
following Morgan Stanley’s rating increase last week. The two
rivals will likely pursue a “more rational” approach to
competition, prizing higher fees over market-share gains,
analysts at BTG, including Eduardo Nishio, wrote in a note to
clients today.  “We give the benefit of the doubt on a more rational
competitive environment among incumbents, particularly on
pricing,” the analysts wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
