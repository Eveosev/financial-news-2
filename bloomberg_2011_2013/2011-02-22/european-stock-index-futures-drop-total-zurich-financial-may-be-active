European stocks retreated for a
third day as Libya cracked down on anti-government protests amid
continuing political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa,
overshadowing a jump in U.S. consumer confidence.    Air France-KLM  Group fell 3 percent as oil climbed to the
highest price in more than two years.  Informa Plc , the U.K.
publisher of Lloyd’s List, lost 2.9 percent after earnings
declined. Jyske Bank A/S advanced 7.5 percent after reporting
profit that beat analysts’ estimates. Technical problems forced
a 6 1/2-hour delay to the start of trading in Italy today.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped 0.6 percent to 285.38 at
the 4:30 p.m. close in London for the biggest three-day decline
since November. The gauge has still rallied 3.5 percent this
year amid speculation the economic recovery will continue. It
peaked at the highest level since August 2008 on last week.  Events in the Middle East and North Africa are “a trigger
for a correction,” said  Markus Steinbeis , head of equity
portfolio management at the Unterfoehring, Germany-based unit of
Pioneer Investments KGmbH, which oversees about $221 billion
globally. The market is pricing in the possibility that
instability could spread to  Saudi Arabia , he said.  Oil surged to the highest price since September 2008 as
soldiers deserted Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi’s government and
diplomats resigned in protest over a crackdown on anti-
government demonstrators that has left hundreds dead. Chinese
authorities blocked foreign news reports on protests to resist
any movement toward pro-democracy revolts.  ‘Increasingly Nervous’  “Markets are becoming increasingly nervous over the
deteriorating situation in both North Africa and the Middle
East,” said  Ben Potter , a research analyst at IG Markets in
Melbourne. “There’s a notable risk of contagion amidst reports
that  China  is doing all it can to block coverage of the
protests.”  Stocks recouped some losses after a U.S. report showed
consumer confidence rose in February to the highest level in
three years. The Conference Board’s index of sentiment increased
to 70.4 from 64.8 the prior month. Economists had projected a
reading of 65.5, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey.  National benchmark indexes declined in all 18 western
European markets, except Portugal. The U.K.’s  FTSE 100 Index 
fell 0.3 percent and France’s CAC 40 sank 1.2 percent. Greece’s
ASE Index slid 2.9 percent.  Italian Trading Delay  Italy’s FTSE MIB slid 1.1 percent after trading opened 6
1/2 hours late because of “technical issues.”  UniCredit SpA ,
Italy’s biggest bank, slid 1.8 percent to 1.84 euros.  Impregilo
SpA , the country’s largest construction company, lost 2.1
percent to 2.62 euros. The company has 1 billion euros of
projects in Libya, according to Milan broker Equita Sim SpA.  Air France, Europe’s biggest airline, slumped 3 percent to
11.79 euros amid speculation higher oil prices will increase
fuel costs. The decline pulled a measure of travel and leisure
shares to the biggest decrease among 19 industry groups in the
Stoxx 600.  Informa sank 2.9 percent to 436.2 pence, the biggest
retreat this month. The publishing company said full-year net
income fell to 98.9 million pounds ($160 million) from 105.6
million pounds.    National Bank of Greece SA , the nation’s largest lender,
slid 2.1 percent to 7.44 euros, while  EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA ,
the second-biggest, declined 4.2 percent to 4.60 euros.  Greece may be unable to sustain efforts to tackle its debt,
forcing a restructuring of bond payments, European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development President Thomas Mirow said in an
interview with Sueddeutsche Zeitung.  Q-Cells, Jyske  Q-Cells SE retreated 4.2 percent to 3.17 euros even after
the German solar company reported increased 2010 sales.  “2011 will look more challenging,” Stefan Freudenreich
and Sebastian Growe, Frankfurt-based analysts at Equinet AG,
wrote in a report. “The stock does not offer any upside after
the recent outperformance versus peers.” The brokerage
reiterated its “hold” recommendation on the shares.  Jyske Bank gained 7.5 percent to 237 kroner, the biggest
advance since May, as Denmark’s second-largest lender reported
fourth-quarter net income of 310 million kroner ($56.3 million)
compared with a median estimate of 295 million kroner in a
Bloomberg survey of six analysts.    Croda International Plc  soared 9.7 percent to 1,639 pence,
the biggest jump in more than two years, as the supplier of
ingredients for Nivea sunblock announced a share buyback program
and earnings that beat analyst estimates.    Kerry Group Plc  rose 2.8 percent to 26.12 euros as
Ireland’s biggest food company said full-year net income climbed
to 324.2 million euros ($440 million) from 201.2 million euros a
year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Julie Cruz  in Frankfurt at
