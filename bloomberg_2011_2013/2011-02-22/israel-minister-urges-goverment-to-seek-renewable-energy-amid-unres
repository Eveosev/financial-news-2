  Israel  must seek alternative energy
resources amid regional instability and Iranian efforts to take
control of energy reserves in the Middle East, Vice Prime
Minister Silvan Shalom said today.  “Israel must guarantee energy independence especially in
light of the regional instability and the economic
implications,” Shalom said in remarks sent in an e-mailed
statement. “Now is the time to accelerate the development of
renewable energy.”  Shalom spoke to a renewable energy conference as  oil prices 
surged to the highest in more than two years and Middle East
protests that have spread to Libya left hundreds dead. Libya is
the holder of  Africa ’s largest oil reserves.  “We are witnessing a tremendous struggle between the West
and Iran over who will control of the Middle East and its energy
reserves for the next 150 years,” Shalom said, pointing to
reports that Iran was sending warships through the  Suez Canal  to
the Mediterranean Sea. Iran says the ships are due to visit
Syria, an ally with few energy reserves.  Alternative energy, which would be developed in less-
populated areas of Israel, would have the added benefit of
boosting Israel’s economy by 44 billion shekels ($12 billion)
and adding thousands of jobs, Shalom said, citing ministry
economists.  “The renewable energy sector can generate economic growth
engines,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
