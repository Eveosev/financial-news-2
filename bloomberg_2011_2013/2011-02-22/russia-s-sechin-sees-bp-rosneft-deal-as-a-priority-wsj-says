Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor
Sechin described the agreement between  BP Plc  and OAO Rosneft as
a “strategic priority” and warned both companies to avoid
letting differences get in the way, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing an interview with him.  Sechin, who is also chairman of Rosneft, said legal action
would be taken against BP if it tried to sabotage the $16
billion deal, under which BP will bring its offshore drilling
experience to Russia’s Arctic coastal areas, the newspaper said.  Under the agreement, BP and Rosneft will swap shares, with
the Russian company taking a 5 percent stake in BP, and the U.K.
building a 9.4 percent stake in Rosneft; Sechin said he would
like to both companies to appoint members to each other’s board,
the WSJ said.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:  Chris Peterson  at
