  Humana Inc ., a U.S. healthcare
group, will partner with  Discovery Holdings Ltd ., Africa’s
largest medical insurance administrator, to offer clients of the
U.S. company wellness and loyalty programs.  As part of the plan, Humana, based in Louisville,  Kentucky ,
will set up a new entity in the U.S. in which Discovery will
have a 25 percent stake. Humana will also buy 25 percent of The
Vitality Group, Discovery’s U.S. subsidiary, the companies said
in a statement today. The value of the transaction wasn’t
disclosed.  The partnership will give Humana customers access to the
wellness and loyalty programs designed by Discovery and provide
the Johannesburg-based insurer with the opportunity to sell its
incentive plans to Humana’s 10 million medical members, the
companies said. Discovery’s program in  South Africa  offers
discounted gym memberships and subsidizes the purchase of fruit
and vegetables to help the insurer lower medical claims.  Discovery posted net income of 1.42 billion rand ($197
million) for the six months through December, up from 829
million rand a year earlier, the company said in a separate
statement. Sales rose 83 percent to 5.98 billion rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
