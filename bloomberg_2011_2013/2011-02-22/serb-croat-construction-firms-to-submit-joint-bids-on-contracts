Serbian and Croatian construction
companies have agreed to submit joint bids for contracts in the
Middle East, North Africa and  Russia  as domestic demand wanes,
said Goran Rodic of the  Serbian Chamber of Commerce .  Executives from the two former Yugoslav republics, which
were at war in the 1990s, said they will pool their resources in
an effort to win projects in  Algeria , Libya,  Kazakhstan  and
industrial facilities in Krasnoyarsk, Russia.  On their own, companies in Serbia and Croatia are too small
to compete for multibillion-dollar infrastructure projects in
the Middle East, Rodic said.  “In Libya, for example, there are rarely any projects
under $150 million,” said Goran Knezevic, chief executive
officer of  Medjimurje Graditeljstvo d.o.o ., at a business
conference in Belgrade today. “If you are expected to make
5,000 apartments in two years, you have to be big enough or
partner with someone.”  Medjimurje had almost 400 employees in 2007 when its
revenue peaked at $39 million, shrinking by more than a third
last year.  Djordjo Antelj, the owner of Belgrade-based  Gemax , said the
cross-border cooperation would include forming a joint bank to
facilitate  project financing .  To contact the reporter on this story:
