Commodities jumped to their highest
in more than two years, led by gains in energy as violence in  Libya  stoked speculation oil supplies will be disrupted.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Total Return Index of 24
commodities rose as much as 4.6 percent from the Feb. 18
settlement to 5,264.6 points, the highest level since November
2008. The gauge was at 5,127.2 as of 5:41 p.m. in London. Crude
oil futures jumped 5.7 percent and cocoa climbed to a 32-year
high in  New York  as Ivory Coast’s  Alassane Ouattara , recognized
as the president by the United Nations, ordered an extension of
an export ban on beans from the world’s largest grower.  “The market is very, very sensitive to headlines with the
political unrest for cocoa in the Ivory Coast and with oil in
Libya and the Middle East,” said Jeremy Gatto, head of trading
at Tiberius Asset Management AG in Zug, Switzerland. Libya has
Africa’s largest crude oil reserves.  Crude oil prices may extend gains, reaching a record,
should the unrest in Libya spread to larger producers in the
Middle East, such as  Saudi Arabia , according to Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.  “Risk is to the upside for these commodities because there
is no means of seeing an end to the crisis,” Gatto said.  Crude oil for April delivery rose as much as $8.77 to
$98.48 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  and was last
at $94.83c. Floor trading was closed yesterday for the U.S.
Presidents’ Day holiday and electronic trades will be booked
with today’s transactions for settlement purposes.  Cocoa for May delivery climbed $63, or 1.8 percent, to
$3,562 a metric ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New York after
touching $3,608, the highest price since January 1979.  Silver futures rose 1.4 percent to $32.74 an ounce, after
earlier today gaining to $34.315, the highest price since March
1980.  To contact the reporter on this story:
