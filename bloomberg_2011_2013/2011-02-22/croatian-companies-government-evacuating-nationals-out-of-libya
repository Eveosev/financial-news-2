  Croatia ’s  Foreign Ministry  is
working with companies that have employees in Libya to evacuate
Croatian citizens amid civil unrest in the North African nation.  About 500 Croatian nationals are currently in Libya, the
ministry said in a statement. Most of the people work for
Croatian companies such as construction firms Montmontaza d.d.
and Viadukt d.d., geophysical research company Geofizika d.d.,
and  Crosco d.d ., a drilling unit of INA Industrija Nafte d.d.  “We are doing all we can to help bring the workers back to
Croatia,” the ministry said, adding it is cooperating with the
governments of Germany and  Turkey  in making evacuation plans.  INA, Croatia’s largest refiner controlled by Hungary’s Mol
Nyrt., said yesterday it is in the process of evacuating its
Crosco employees out of  Libya .  To contact the reporter on this story: Jasmina Kuzmanovic at
