  Medco Health Solutions Inc .,
the largest U.S. prescription benefits manager, fell the
most in seven months in New York trading on concern that
profit growth isn’t accelerating.  The  Franklin Lakes , New Jersey-based company’s failure
to increase its 2011 forecast may have led investors to
temper optimism, said  Arthur Henderson , an analyst at
Jefferies & Co. in Nashville,  Tennessee . Medco affirmed
today its 2011 per-share forecast of $3.99 to $4.12.  While earnings were “just fine” in the fourth
quarter of 2010, “this year is just kind of steady as she
goes,” Henderson said in an interview. “That, for some
people, is maybe not enough at the moment.”  Medco slid $3.33, or 5.1 percent, to $61.45 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest
decline since July 22. The company reported fourth-quarter
earnings of 94 cents a share that matched analysts’
estimates.  “Our job is to deliver earnings growth each and every
quarter, and that’s what we’re focused on doing,”
Richard Rubino, the company’s chief financial officer, said
today in an interview.  Pharmacy benefit managers are in a temporary “lull”
because there won’t be many generic drugs introduced this
year, Henderson said. Next year will be “great” for the
industry, partly because generic forms of  Pfizer Inc .’s
Lipitor, the world’s biggest-selling drug, will become
available after the medication loses patent protection in
November of this year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
