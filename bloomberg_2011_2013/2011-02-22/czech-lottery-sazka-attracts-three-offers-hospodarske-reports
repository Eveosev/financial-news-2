offers to acquire a majority stake in Sazka AS, a Czech lottery
operator that has missed payments on its debt,  Hospodarske
Noviny  reported, citing Sazka shareholders and the investment
companies.  Penta Investments and E-Invest have jointly offered to put
1.7 billion koruna ($94.4 million) into Sazka in exchange for a
54 percent stake, while KKCG, owned by a Czech entrepreneur
Karel Komarek, has offered 2.8 billion koruna for 67 percent,
the newspaper reported. Entrepreneur Radovan Vitek has offered
1 billion for 100 percent of Sazka, it said.  Komarek and Vitek have bought part of Sazkaâ€™s debt and they
have both filed for an insolvency procedure against the lottery
company.  To contact the reporters on this story:
