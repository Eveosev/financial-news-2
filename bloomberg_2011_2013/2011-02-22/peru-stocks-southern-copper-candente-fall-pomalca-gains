The following companies had unusual
price changes in  Peru  trading. Stock symbols are in parentheses
and share prices are as of 5.50 p.m. New York time.  The Lima General Index fell 1.5 percent to 22,694.93 The
MSCI All Peru Capped Index fell 1.3 percent to 3,076.94.  Copper producers fell after the metal slumped the most in
three months on concern the surging cost of oil may slow
economic growth, curbing demand for the metal used in wires and
plumbing.    Southern Copper Corp . (SCCO PE), Peru’s biggest copper
producer, fell 4 percent to $40.81, the lowest price since
October.    Candente Copper Corp . (DNT PE), a Canadian exploration
company, fell 7.9 percent to $1.99, a one-month low.  Cia. Minera Atacocha SA (ATACOBC1 PE), the Lima-based zinc
producer, tumbled 2.9 percent to 1.34 soles.  Empresa Agroindustrial Pomalca SA (POMALCC1 PE), a Peruvian
sugar producer, surged the most since September, jumping 14
percent to 67 centimos.  Pomalca rose on speculation a government transfer of shares
to workers may lead to a takeover bid the company, said Arlen Lahura, a trader at Lima-based brokerage Coril SAB.  The government’s measure will give 3,500 workers and
retirees control of about 45 percent of Pomalca’s shares, said
Pedro Luyando, a company spokesman, in a phone interview. Once
the workers receive the shares, they will be unable to sell them
for at least two years, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
