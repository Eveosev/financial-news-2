  Centamin Egypt Ltd ., a gold company
operating in the North African country, said its Sukari mine is
functioning normally following a protest last week.  “Sukari has been back to normal since Saturday morning,
and mining and processing are continuing as normal,” Bobby Morse, a London-based company spokesman, said today by phone.  Workers at the Sukari site staged a sit-in last week to
demand higher pay and a change of ownership, state news service
MENA reported Feb. 18. The company’s shares fell the most in
more than two years that day.  The stock fell 2.9 percent to 125.6 pence by the 4:30 p.m.
close of London trading after rebounding 5.8 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
