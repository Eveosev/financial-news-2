Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA will
supply German utility  E.ON AG  with a prototype wind turbine for
use offshore as  Spain ’s largest maker of the machines builds a
sea-based business to cater for demand in  Europe .  Gamesa will provide E.ON a test model of its G11X-5.0
megawatt turbine in 2012, the company said today in a statement.
Gamesa is designing two offshore wind models with capacities of
5 megawatts and 6 to 7 megawatts to prepare for a surge in
demand expected from 2015 in northern Europe.  Duesseldorf-based E.ON is seeking new technology and
encourages more market participants in the wind industry,
Christian Drepper, a spokesman for E.ON, said by phone.  “Given the fact we are heavily into offshore wind
worldwide, we are very interested in having a good supply,” he
said. “In our offshore wind farms we have all the available
technology on the market already installed, from the ‘normal’
suppliers up to the really sophisticated.”  E.ON won rights to develop a 650-megawatt site off the
Sussex coast under the U.K.’s Round 3 offshore wind program last
year. It is seeking to procure suppliers and build the project
in 2014 to 2016, according to its website.  The company has four offshore wind farms in the U.K. and
won consent for a fifth this month.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
