As many as 22 companies are
interested in  Greece ’s plan to liberalize its energy market by
swapping lignite-power produced by  Public Power  Corp. SA for
power produced in another European Union country,  Kathimerini 
reported, without citing anyone.  Italy’s  Edison Spa , the  Czech Republic ’s  CEZ AS , London-
based EFT Group and  Switzerland ’s  Alpiq Holding AG  are among the
interested European companies, the newspaper said.  Greek companies considering the plan include  Mytilineos
Holdings SA , Gek Terna SA and Elpedison, a joint venture of
Edison and  Hellenic Petroleum SA , the newspaper added.  The first market test for the plan will take place in early
May with Public Power tendering 300 megawatts of lignite power
in 15 batches of 20 megawatts, Kathimerini said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
