  Iraq ’s government is planning to cut
the pay and benefits of top officials by more than half, said
Ali Al-Dabbagh, the government spokesman.  The government approved a draft law that reduces salaries
and sent it to parliament for approval, Dabbagh said in an e-
mailed statement today. The money saved will be used for
reconstruction projects and to achieve equality in pay and
benefits, he said.  Iraqi protesters, inspired by unrest across the Arab
world, have taken to the streets to demonstrate against poor
living conditions, power rationing and corruption. Iraq, owner
of the world’s fifth-biggest crude reserves, is seeking foreign
investment to help boost energy exports and pay for rebuilding a
shattered economy and infrastructure following decades of war
and sanctions.  The draft law would cut by more than 50 percent the
salaries and benefits of the president, the prime minister, the
parliament speaker and all their deputies, Dabbagh said.
Compensation for ministers and members of parliament would be
slashed by more than 40 percent, he said.  Parliament approved a 96.6 trillion-dinar ($82.6 billion)
budget for 2011 that forecasts a deficit of about 15.7 trillion
dinars.  Iraq has awarded 15 contracts for oil and gas exploration
licenses since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 that ousted the
administration of former President  Saddam Hussein .  To contact the reporter on this story:
