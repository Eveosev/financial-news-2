JSC Energo-Pro Georgia  is planning a
$493 million project to build two hydropower plants and a power
cable to connect  Georgia  and  Turkey .  The stations, to be built in mountainous western Georgia,
will have a combined capacity of 70.6 megawatts and a total
value of $370 million, said Tamar Dograshvili, a spokeswoman at
the Tblisi-based company, by phone. Energo-Pro also plans a $123
million 154-kilowatt electricity line from Georgia to Turkey.
She didn’t specify the timeframe for the construction.  The company is a unit of Svitavy, Czech Republic-based
Energo-Pro AS.  Georgia’s Prime Minister Nika Gilauri said in an interview
in December last year that he’s “confident” the country will
receive as much as $5 billion in investments in hydropower over
“the next few years” after signing 42 preliminary deals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
