  Hewlett-Packard Co . call-option
volume jumped to a 12-week high before the world’s largest maker
of personal computers reported earnings today after the market
close.  More than 75,500 calls to buy the stock changed hands
today, almost five times the four-week average and 1.3 times the
number of puts to sell. The most-traded contracts were the April
$52.50 calls, which accounted for one-fifth of all call volume.  Palo Alto , California-based HP dropped 0.9 percent to $48.23.  HP said its per-share profit excluding some items was
$1.36, compared with the average $1.29 a share forecast of 31
analyst estimates from a Bloomberg survey. The stock declined
7.1 percent to $44.82 in after-market trading as the company
predicted second-quarter adjusted earnings of as little as $1.19
a share, below analyst estimates for $1.26 a share.  “The options market is pricing in a one-day absolute move
of about 5 percent in reaction to the release,” according to a
report by options strategists at Susquehanna Financial Group LLP
in  Bala Cynwyd ,  Pennsylvania . “This is higher than the average
move over the past four reports of about 1.5 percent, including
just over a 2 percent move to the upside last quarter.”  HP’s implied volatility, the key gauge of option prices,
for at-the-money options expiring in 30 days rose to 29.74 from
25.67 on Feb. 18.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
