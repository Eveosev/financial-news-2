The Polish zloty slid to the weakest
level in almost eight weeks as violence in  Libya  weakened demand
for riskier assets and central bank policy maker  Adam Glapinski 
was quoted as saying he saw no basis for an interest rate
increase at the moment.  Polandâ€™s currency declined 0.7 percent to 3.9701 per euro,
extending its losing streak to a third day at 8:45 a.m. in
Warsaw. The zloty lost the most among more than 20 emerging-
market currencies tracked by Bloomberg and reached the weakest
intraday level since Dec. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
