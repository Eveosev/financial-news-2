Korean Air Lines Co. plunged the
most in almost two years, leading declines among Asian carriers,
as oil prices jumped on political unrest in Libya.  South Korea’s largest carrier fell as much as 10 percent,
the biggest intraday decline since May 2009, to 61,900 won and
traded at 62,700 won as of 11:55 a.m. in Seoul.  Air China Ltd .,
the world’s largest carrier by market value, fell as much as 6.4
percent in  Hong Kong , the most in more than two months.  Oil futures surged to the highest in more than two years as
al-Jazeera reported that at least 250 people died in Tripoli in
violence linked to protests against the regime of Muammar Qaddafi, whose state holds Africa’s largest oil reserves. Fuel
comprises more than 30 percent of operating costs for Korean 
Air, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “A jump in fuel prices is going to be a big cost burden
for airlines,” said Jee Heon Seok at NH Investment & Securities
Co. in Seoul. “There’s only so much you can offset with
surcharges.”  Still, investors may be “overreacting” to the troubles in  Libya , he said.  Crude oil for April delivery rose as much as 9.6 percent in
New York today from the close on Feb. 18, reaching as high as
$98.48. The price of jet fuel rose 1.5 percent yesterday to
$120.65 a barrel, the highest since September 2008, in Singapore.  A $1 increase in the price of crude oil boosts airline
industry costs by about $1.6 billion, according to the
International Air Transport Association, a trade group.  Singapore Air, Cathay Pacific    Singapore Airlines Ltd ., the world’s second-largest carrier
by market value, dropped as much as 2.2 percent to S$14.02 in
the city-state.  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd ., Hong Kong’s largest
airline, declined as much as 5.3 percent to HK$18.06 in Hong
Kong. All Nippon Airways Co., Asia’s largest listed carrier by
sales, fell as much as 2.3 percent to 304 yen in Tokyo.    Asiana Airlines  Inc., South Korea’s second-largest carrier,
plunged as much as 10 percent to 10,450 won in Seoul.  China
Airlines Ltd ., Taiwan’s largest carrier, dropped as much as 6.8
percent to NT$17.90, the lowest intraday price since Aug. 2, in
Taipei.  EVA Airways Corp ., the second-largest, sank as much as 7
percent in the city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
