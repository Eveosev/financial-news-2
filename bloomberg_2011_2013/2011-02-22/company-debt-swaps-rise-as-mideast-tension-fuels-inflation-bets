The cost of insuring European
corporate bonds rose as escalating tension in  Libya  drove crude  oil prices  to the highest in more than two years, fueling
concern that global inflation will accelerate.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
on 50 companies with mostly junk credit ratings rose 7 basis
points to 394, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 11 a.m. in
London.  A crackdown on protesters in Libya, holder of  Africa ’s
largest oil reserves, has killed more than 300 people, according
to the International Federation for Human Rights, and prompted
companies including Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Statoil ASA to
evacuate staff or halt operations. Investors are concerned
rising oil prices will fuel inflation and undermine the global
recovery.  “Higher input costs, including oil, have various knock-on
impacts on margins and credit quality,” Eric Sharper, an
analyst at Credit Agricole SA in  London , wrote in a note to
investors. “The autos and industrials sectors’ performance are
among the most correlated to energy costs, so keep an eye on
those.”  Default swaps on Eni SpA, the largest foreign oil producer
in Libya, increased 6.5 basis points to 97, the highest level
since July, according to CMA.  iTraxx Europe  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 1.75 basis points to 100.25,
JPMorgan prices show. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of 25
banks and insurers was unchanged at 165 and the subordinated
index rose 3 basis points to 279.  The cost of insuring the region’s sovereign debt also
increased, CMA prices show. Swaps on Morocco jumped 17.5 basis
points to 205,  Egypt  climbed 13.5 to 371, Dubai rose 6.5 to 452
and  Israel  was up 2.5 at 160.  Swaps on  Saudi Arabia , used as a measure of confidence in
the country although it has no debt, rose 2 basis points to a
19-month high of 145. Contracts on  Abu Dhabi  rose 3.5 to 116.5,
Qatar was 3 higher at 116 and Bahrain rose 5 to 318.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting $10
million of debt from default for five years is equivalent to
$1,000 a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
