(Corrects location of bank in first paragraph.)  African Banking Corp., a Kenyan
lender, said full-year profit doubled as earnings from loans
increased.  Net income climbed to 336.6 million shillings ($4.11
million) in the 12 months through December, from 167.2 million
shillings a year earlier, the company said in a statement
published in the Nairobi-based Daily Nation newspaper today.
Interest income, the amount banks earn from interest on loans,
jumped to 1.06 billion shillings from 875.2 million shillings,
it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
