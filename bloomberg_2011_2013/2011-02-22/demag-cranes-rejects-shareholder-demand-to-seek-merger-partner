  Demag Cranes AG , the German maker of
harbor cranes that was approached by Finnish competitor  Konecranes Oyj  last year, said pressure from shareholders to
resume talks won’t sway management to reconsider a combination.  The company, based in Dusseldorf, said it received a letter
from shareholders urging the board to merge Demag with
Konecranes or another potential partner. Among the authors of
the letter was Centaurus Capital Ltd.,  Demag Cranes ’s second-
largest investor, according to the Financial Times.  “We have received and responded to this letter already and
would like to point out that we carefully evaluated preliminary,
non-binding indications of interest we received from foreign
companies last year,” Demag Cranes spokesman Nikolai Juchem
said. “Management and supervisory board unanimously agreed the
suggested talks would yield no benefits for the company.”  Helsinki-based Konecreanes said Feb. 3 that it will not
pursue its approach of Demag after the target company rebuffed a
combination. Konecranes spokesman Michael Wegmueller had no
comment on the letter sent by investors.  Centaurus Capital holds 5.06 percent of Demag’s shares,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The biggest shareholder
is Cevian Capital, a Stockholm-based fund led by activist
investor Christer Gardell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
