The price of natural gas shipments
for next-day delivery in  Ohio  rose for the first time in four
days as colder weather raised demand for the heating fuel.  Temperatures will be below normal in the Midwest through
Feb. 26, according to MDA Federal Inc.’s EarthSat Energy Weather
in Rockville, Maryland.  Wholesale gas delivered into Columbia Gas Transmission in
Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania,  West Virginia , Virginia and  New
York  gained 4.65 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $3.9901 per million
British thermal units on the  Intercontinental Exchange .  About 3.07 million dekatherms of gas (about 2.99 billion
cubic feet) were to be delivered to residences in the state as
of 3:10 p.m. today, the most since Feb. 11, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Scheduled delivery has jumped 41 percent
since Feb. 6.  Total scheduled gas shipments to the U.S. for residential
use gained 0.1 percent to 38.7 million dekatherms, according to
Bloomberg data. Shipments for  power plants  were set to decline
2.3 percent to 10.3 million dekatherms.  The low temperature in Cincinnati of 28 degrees Fahrenheit
(minus 2 Celsius) early today was the normal temperature for the
date, according to AccuWeather Inc. in State College,
Pennsylvania. The low in Cleveland of 15 degrees was 7 degrees
below normal.  About 69 percent of Ohio’s heating demand is powered by
natural gas, according to  the Energy Department .  To contact the reporter on this story:
