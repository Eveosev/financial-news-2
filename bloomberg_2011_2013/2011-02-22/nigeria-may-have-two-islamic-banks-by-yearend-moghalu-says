Nigeria will see as many as two
Islamic banks open by the end of the year, according to Kingsley Moghalu, a  Central Bank  of  Nigeria  deputy governor.  Two or three “conventional banks” have expressed interest
in opening “Islamic windows,” he said in an interview in
London today. He declined to name the banks.  “We recognize Islamic finance is a very helpful system and
we want to develop it,” he said at a conference in London.
“Nigeria is a huge potential market. We have about 70 percent
of the population who are unbanked. In the north you have a
very, very strong market, people are yearning for this.”  Nigeria, Africa’s third-largest economy, is home to 75
million Muslims, or about half its population. Lamido Sanusi,
governor of the central bank, said Sept. 24 the country plans to
sell its first Islamic debt within 12 months as part of a bid to
become the continent’s center for Shariah-compliant financing.  To contact the reporters on this story:  Chris Kay in  London  at
