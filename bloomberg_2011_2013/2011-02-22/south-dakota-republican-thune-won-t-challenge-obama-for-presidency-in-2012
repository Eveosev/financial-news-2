Senator John Thune, a South Dakota
Republican considering a presidential candidacy, said today he
has no plans to challenge President  Barack Obama  in 2012.  Although a statement he issued didn’t flatly rule out a
White House bid, he said, “at this time, I feel that I am best
positioned to fight for America’s future here in the trenches of
the United States Senate.”  Thune, 50, also said “there is a battle to be waged over
what kind of country we are going to leave our children and
grandchildren and that battle is happening now in Washington,
not two years from now.”  He was among the potential Republican presidential
contenders who spoke earlier this month at the annual
Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington.  Thune first won his seat in 2004, defeating then-Senate
Democratic Leader Tom Daschle. He won re-election last November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
