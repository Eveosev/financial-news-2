David Rapin, business development
director at BlueNext SA, comments on potential delays in the
settlement of spot carbon trades to protect against theft.  The Paris-based exchange was the biggest spot exchange for
emission allowances last year. EU officials said Feb. 9 they may
consider a trading delay to help prevent “phishing attacks,”
where thieves steal passwords to gain access to electronic
accounts that hold permits.  On the length of possible delays in spot transactions:  “It’s necessary to discuss with the European Commission to
understand very clearly what the role of these measures is. If
this measure is to avoid phishing and hacking, we think it could
be useful, but we must put that in a more global discussion,
because if you only delay by several hours the validation of a
transfer, you need to be sure that the timing between a phishing
attack and the fact that you discover this phishing is only two
or three hours. If it’s three days or four days or one week, I
don’t know if these measures would be sufficient to address the
issue.”  On spot vs. futures contracts:  If the delay is one week or more, “it’s no longer a spot
product, it’s much more a one-week future. We must question all
the potential solutions for phishing and hacking.” BlueNext
spokesman Keiron Allen declined to comment on how long any delay
should be.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Alan Katz  in Paris at
