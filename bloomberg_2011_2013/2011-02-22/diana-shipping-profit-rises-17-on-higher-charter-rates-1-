  Diana Shipping Inc ., a carrier of
commodities including iron ore and coal, said fourth-quarter
profit rose 17 percent as shipping rates from long-term charters
gained and the company’s fleet expanded.  Net income increased to $32.3 million, or 40 cents a share,
from $27.6 million, or 34 cents, a year earlier, the Athens-
based company said today in a statement. Diana was expected to
earn 40 cents a share, according to the average of six analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 24 percent to $73
million from $58.6 million.  Diana kept its entire fleet under long-term contracts to
avoid volatility in spot, or one-voyage, rates. This strategy
kept Diana from a decline in spot rates. The Baltic Dry Index, a
measure of spot shipping rates in the dry-bulk market, was 30
percent lower in the quarter than the same period a year
earlier, according to London-based Baltic Exchange.  “Diana is relatively insulated from what’s going on within
the  spot market  because they have a fair amount of longer-term
charter coverage,” said Michael Webber, senior analyst at  Wells
Fargo Securities LLC  in New York. “They are certainly not a
spot player.”  Diana fell 60 cents, or 4.8 percent, to $11.96 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have advanced 3.3
percent this year.  “We view conditions in the dry bulk market for the year
ahead as extremely challenging, particularly in terms of the
supply demand in balance,” Chief Executive Officer Simeon P. Palios said today in a conference call.  Diana operated 25 vessels in the fourth quarter, up from 20
a year ago.  The Baltic Dry Index averaged 2,364 in the fourth quarter,
down from 3,401 a year earlier.  Diana was paid an average charter rate of $31,602 per day
in the quarter, up 1.9 percent from $31,003 a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
