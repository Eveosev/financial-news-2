U.S. hedge-fund managers are
reacting to the government’s insider-trading investigation by
hiring security firms to comb their offices and homes for
listening devices, the Financial Times reported.  Christopher Falkenberg, of  New York  firm Insite Security,
said  hedge funds  have, in the past six months, shown heightened
interest in electronic sweeps to make sure the phones are
secured and the offices aren’t bugged, the newspaper reported.  Federal prosecutors in New York have filed criminal charges
against more than 40 people, alleging that they shared
confidential information about company earnings and
acquisitions; at least 15 hedge funds improperly received inside
information, according to court papers filed by the Securities
and Exchange Commission, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
