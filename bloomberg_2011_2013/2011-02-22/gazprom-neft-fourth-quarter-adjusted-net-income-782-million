OAO Gazprom Neft, the oil producer
controlled by Russiaâ€™s gas exporter, decreased fourth-quarter
net income to $782 million from a previously estimated $873
million after setting aside money to pay fines.  The adjustment takes into account a $198 million provision
for fines imposed by the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service, the
company said in a  statement  on its website today.  Excluding the one-off item, profit rose 13 percent to $980
million from $865 million in the third quarter, Gazprom Neft
said.  The antitrust watchdog had imposed the fines on Gazprom
Neft in two separate cases for oil product pricing and abuse of
its dominant position on the Russian fuel market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
