  E.ON AG , Germany’s biggest utility,
said it plans to resume output at its Oskarshamn-3 nuclear
reactor in southeast Sweden on Feb. 24.  The 1,400 megawatt facility halted at 1:24 a.m. local time
today, the company said in a message via the Nordic power
exchange Nord Pool Spot AS.  “Measures are pending on the turbine control systems and
equipment with subsequent test,” E.ON said.  The stop follows last month’s three-day halt when
Oskarshamn-3 was offline because of faults in the unit’s
pressure nitrogen system. The German power producer owns 55
percent of the plant and  Fortum Oyj  of Finland the rest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
