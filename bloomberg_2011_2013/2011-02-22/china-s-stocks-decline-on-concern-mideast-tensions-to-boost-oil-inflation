China’s stocks fell, led by banks
and property developers, as worsening Middle East tensions and
surging  oil prices  fanned concerns inflation will accelerate and
force the government to adopt more tightening measures.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. and China Vanke
Co. paced declines for lenders and real-estate companies. China
Southern Airlines Co., the biggest carrier, paced losses for
airlines as oil surged to the highest in more than two years
after the son of Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  threatened
“rivers of blood” unless the uprising ends. PetroChina Ltd., the
largest energy producer, jumped 0.7 percent.      The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, slid 6.9 points, or 0.2 percent, to
2,925.32 at 10:05 a.m. The CSI 300 Index lost 0.3 percent to
3,248.30.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
