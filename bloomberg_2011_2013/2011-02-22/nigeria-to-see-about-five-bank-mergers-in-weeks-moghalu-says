Nigeria’s banking industry will have
as many as eight mergers in the “near future,” most of them
within weeks, according to Kingsley Moghalu, a  Central Bank  of
Nigeria deputy governor.  “About” five bank mergers will take place in the next
couple of weeks, to be followed by two or three more in the
“near future,” Moghalu said in an interview in London today.
He declined to name the banks.  The mergers are part of plans by the Central Bank of
Nigeria to reform the banking system after the industry headed
toward collaps in 2009 following a debt crisis. The central bank
fired the chief executives of eight of the country’s 24 banks
and bailed out the industry with 620 billion naira ($4 billion).
BusinessDay reported yesterday that at least four companies will
sign buyout agreements for four banks before the end of the
month.  “It’s going very positively,” Moghalu said.   Nigeria  is a
case of very innovative” reforms and is “ahead of the curve and
confidence is returning to the banking system, though we are not
out of the woods yet,” he said.  Vine Capital will sign an agreement to buy  Afribank Nigeria
Plc , Lagos-based BusinessDay newspaper reported, without saying
how it got the information. Access Bank Plc will invest in
Intercontinental Bank Plc, while  First Bank of Nigeria Plc  will
take a stake in Oceanic Bank International Plc, it said. First
City Monument Bank Plc plans to invest in Finbank Plc, it said.
Capital Alliance will sign an agreement with Union Bank of
Nigeria Plc, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:  Chris Kay in  London  at
