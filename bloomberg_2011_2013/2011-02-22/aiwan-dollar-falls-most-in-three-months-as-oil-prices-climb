  Taiwan ’s dollar dropped the most in
more than three months as escalating tensions in the Middle East
drove  oil prices  higher, posing a risk to the global economic
recovery. Government bonds rose.  Yields on benchmark notes dropped to the lowest level in
almost a month after violence in Libya, which holds Africa’s
largest oil reserves, intensified yesterday. Export orders
climbed 13.5 percent last month from a year earlier, Taiwan’s
government reported yesterday. The median forecast of economists
in a Bloomberg survey was for an increase of 18.5 percent.  “Tensions in the Middle East have weighed on the Taiwan
dollar and other Asian currencies, hurt by weak risk appetite
and concern over oil-supply disruptions,” said Ju Wang, an
Asian fixed-income strategist at UBS AG in  Singapore . “Taiwan’s
bonds should benefit from local investors’ search for shelter.”  Taiwan’s dollar fell 0.7 percent, the most since Nov. 12,
to NT$29.557 against its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local
close, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency touched
NT$29.582, the weakest level since Jan. 17.  The yield on the 1 percent bond due January 2016 fell one
basis point to 1.096 percent, the lowest level since Jan. 28,
according to Gretai Securities Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
