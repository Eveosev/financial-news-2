BAA (SP) Ltd., the owner of  London ’s
Heathrow and Stansted airports, said its full-year loss narrowed
after a pension charge wasn’t repeated.  The net loss was 321.8 million pounds ($520 million)
compared with 684 million pounds a year earlier, BAA said today
in a statement. Sales rose 4.9 percent to 2.07 billion pounds as
airport charges rose and passengers spent more in airport shops.  Passenger numbers at Heathrow, Europe’s biggest hub,
advanced even after a cloud of volcanic ash shut U.K. airspace
in April and strikes by cabin crew at British Airways, the
biggest carrier based at the airport, grounded flights. Snow
also shut Heathrow in December.  “We delivered a robust financial performance in 2010,
despite the volcanic ash, strikes and snow that affected major
airports across Europe and  North America ,” Chief Executive
Officer Colin Matthews said in the statement.  BAA, owned by Spanish builder  Ferrovial SA , will likely
have to sell Stansted, and one of either the Edinburgh or
Glasgow, Scotland, airports, after the Supreme Court refused to
hear an appeal of a decision by a competition regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
