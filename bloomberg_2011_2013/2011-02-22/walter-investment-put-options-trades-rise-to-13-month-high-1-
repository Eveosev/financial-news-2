  Walter Investment Management Corp .
call volume jumped to its highest level since December 2009,
with most of the trading concentrated in contracts that have a
strike price 5.6 percent below today’s close.  More than 3,500 puts to sell the mortgage real estate
investment trust changed hands today, 20 times the four-week
average and 47 times the number of calls to buy. The most-traded
contracts were the March $17.50 puts, which accounted for almost
all put volume and rose 33 percent to 20 cents. Ninety percent
of those puts were exchanged at the ask price, indicating that
buyers initiated most of the transactions. Tampa, Florida-based
Walter Investment declined 2.9 percent to $18.53.  The REIT is expected to report a 30 cent profit per share
excluding some items next week, according to the average of
three analyst estimates from a Bloomberg survey. Walter
Investment was created in 2009 through a merger of the company,
which was spun off from coal producer Walter Industries Inc.,
and Hanover Capital Mortgage Holdings Inc.  Walter Investment’s implied volatility, the key gauge of
option prices, for at-the-money options expiring in 30 days rose
to 24.43 from 20.76 Feb. 18.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
