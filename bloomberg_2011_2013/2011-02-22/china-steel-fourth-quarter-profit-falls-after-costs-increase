China Steel Corp. ,  Taiwan ’s largest
steelmaker, had a 71 percent decline in fourth-quarter profit
after failing to pass on increased costs.  Net income fell to NT$4.53 billion ($153 million) in the
three months ended Dec. 31, from NT$15.7 billion a year earlier,
according to figures derived from full-year  earnings  released by
the Kaohsiung-based mill today. That compares with the NT$4.67
billion average of 12 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The company joined ArcelorMittal, the world’s biggest
steelmaker, in reporting lower earnings because of rising raw-
material costs and after prices for the alloy fell. Average
iron-ore prices in  China , a global benchmark, climbed 70 percent
last year as Chinese and Indian steel mills increased purchases,
according to The Steel Index.    China Steel  was squeezed front and back,” said Peter Tzeng, a Taipei-based analyst at Polaris Securities, who has an
“equalweight” rating on the stock.  China Steel fell 0.8 percent to close at NT$33.2 in Taipei
trading before the announcement. The stock has dropped 0.9
percent this year, compared with the 3.3 percent decline in the
benchmark Taiex index.  Sales in the October-to-December period climbed 23 percent
from a year earlier to NT$61.7 billion, based on China Steel’s
monthly exchange filings.  Full-Year Earnings  Full-year net income was NT$37.6 billion, or NT$2.83 a
share, the company said in the statement today.  China Steel plans to pay a cash dividend of NT$1.99 a share
on its 2010 earnings, along with a stock dividend of 50 shares
for every 1,000 shares held by investors, the company said in
the filing.  The mill plans to sell global depositary receipts backed by
as many as 840 million shares, China Steel said in a separate
statement to the stock exchange today. Proceeds will be used to
improve its financial structure and boost working capital.    ArcelorMittal  posted a loss of $780 million in the fourth
quarter, compared with net income of $1.1 billion a year earlier,
the Luxembourg-based company said Feb. 8.  China Steel reduced prices by an average 5.9 percent for
October and November contracts after Chinese mills increased
exports, the company said Aug. 25.  To contact the reporter on the story:
