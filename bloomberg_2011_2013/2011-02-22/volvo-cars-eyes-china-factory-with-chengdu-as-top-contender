Volvo Cars, the Swedish automaker
acquired by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. last year, will
build its first Chinese assembly plant in the city of Chengdu, a
person with direct knowledge of the plan said.  The Swedish carmaker’s supervisory board signed off on the
new factory at a meeting yesterday, said the person, who asked
not to be identified ahead of the official announcement Feb. 25.
Volvo Cars spokesman Stefan Elfstrom declined to comment.  The Chinese factory will probably have an annual capacity
of 100,000 cars, and may open in early 2013, spokesman Olle Axelson said prior to the board’s vote. Volvo currently makes
its S40 and S80L models for  China  at a factory co-owned by Ford
and Chongqing Changan Automobile Co.  Chinese growth is key to Chief Executive Officer Stefan Jacoby’s goal of doubling sales to 800,000 cars in 10 years.
Volvo Cars, which  Ford Motor Co . sold to Zhejiang Geely in
August for $1.5 billion, aims to sell 250,000 cars in China by
2015, up from 30,522 in 2010, spokesman Per-Ake Froberg said.  “China will be the biggest contributor to meeting the
800,000 unit global target,” said  Ashvin Chotai , a London-based
managing director of industry consultant Intelligence Automotive
Asia. “Stepping up local production is a very important step in
being successful in the China market.”  Possible Locations  Volvo Cars was considering Chengdu, Daqing and  Shanghai ’s
Jiading district as possible locations, Axelson said yesterday.
Zhejiang Geely owns 51 percent of Volvo Cars, while Daqing has
37 percent and Jiading has 12 percent.  Volvo plans to hold a ground breaking ceremony in Chengdu
on March 1, signaling the beginning of its factory construction,
a person with direct knowledge of the plan said yesterday.  Economic growth and government incentives boosted China’s
vehicle sales by 32 percent to 18.1 million in 2010, helping the
nation surpass the U.S. as the world’s largest auto market for a
second year.  Volvo’s main rivals boosted their China sales last year.  Volkswagen AG ’s Audi sold 227,938 cars in China last year, up 43
percent from 2009.  Daimler AG ’s Mercedes-Benz sold 148,400 cars,
more than double the previous year, while  Bayerische Motoren
Werke AG  sold 168,998 units, an 87 percent gain.  Zhejiang Geely, which sold more than 415,000 vehicles last
year, aims to boost sales and production this year by at least
18 percent, the company said on January 6.    Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd ., Zhegjiang Geely’s publicly
traded unit, fell by as much as 2.6 percent today in  Hong Kong 
and were traded at HK$3.42 as of 11:45 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
