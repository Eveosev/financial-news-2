--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Reliability of Catfish Feed Deliveries Estimates  Survey Procedures:  All participating catfish feed mills are feed mills that
produce and deliver catfish feed to bonafide catfish producers.  Survey data
for catfish feed are collected from feed mills by the USDA-NASS Mississippi
Field Office, which is responsible for ensuring survey coverage is as
complete as possible.  Mills are contacted by mail, telephone, fax, or
internet.   Diligent effort is made to ensure that all operations are
accounted for in the estimate.  Estimation Procedures:  The "Catfish Feed Deliveries" report refers strictly
to catfish feed delivered to bonafide catfish producers and excludes catfish
feed delivered to producers of other species.  The totals include both bagged
and bulk feed.  Prior to summarization, questionnaires are compared to
previous reports for comparability.  Estimates are made for feed mills whose
reports are not available in time to be included in the release.  Those mills
are identified by an asterisk on page 11 of this release.  Estimates are
based on the mill's previous reports and current conditions.  Published
totals are a straight summation of the individual reports and estimated data.  If a mill uses a fiscal accounting system, proration is used to convert
reported data to a calendar month basis.  Two unusual features of this report are worthy of note:  (1) cooperating feed
mills are listed by name, and (2) it is impossible for the public to infer
the amount of catfish feed produced in each State.  Since many mills deliver
feed to more than one State and to growers of other species, any inferences
about overall production per State or per mill are not valid.  Revision Policy:  Revisions may be necessary in the following month's
publication pending a review of late reports received from mills.  Revisions
to previous estimates are made to improve month-to-month relationships.
Estimates for the previous month are subject to revision in all States and
regions monthly totals.  In February, all monthly estimates for the previous
year are reviewed and subject to revisions.  The review is primarily based on
data that may have been received after the original estimates were published.  Reliability:  Estimates are based on data from cooperating catfish feed
mills, and therefore have no sampling variability.  However, estimates may be
subject to errors such as omissions, duplication, mistakes in reporting,
recording, and processing of data.  These errors are minimized through strict
quality controls in the edit and summarization process and a careful review
of all reported data for consistency and reasonableness.  Terms and Definitions Used for Catfish Feed Deliveries Estimates  Broodfish - Fish kept for egg production, including males.  Broodfish produce
the fertilized eggs that go to hatcheries.  The most desirable size is 3 to
10 pounds or 4 to 6 years of age.  Catfish Feed - For the purposes of this report catfish feed is defined as
feed delivered to bonafide catfish producers.  Thus, it is not the absolute
total amount of feed produced or even sold by a mill.  (Some catfish feed is
sold to producers of other species of fish.)  The definition includes
medicated feed.  Catfish feed is designed to float on the surface of the
water.  Catfish are fed this way from the moment they hatch.  Therefore, they
learn to go to the surface for feed.   The result is a clean nutritious diet
for American farm raised catfish.  Catfish Feed for Foodsize Fish - Feed containing pellets larger than 1/8 of
an inch.  Catfish Feed for Fingerlings/Broodfish - Feed containing pellets 1/8 of an
inch or smaller.  Fingerlings - Fish weighing 2 to 60 pounds per 1,000 fish or 2 to 6 inches in
length.  Foodsize Fish - Fish being grown commercially for human consumption.  Optimum
sizes at harvest depend on the market but are generally no lower than 3/4
pound but near one pound.  Data were compiled in cooperation with the following feed mills:  Alabama Feed Mill LLC     *Land O Lakes
