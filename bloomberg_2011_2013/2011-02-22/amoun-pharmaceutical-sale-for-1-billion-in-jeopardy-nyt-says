The planned sale of the Egyptian
drugmaker Amoun Pharmaceutical and other private-equity deals in
the Middle East have been jeopardized by political upheavel in
the region, the New York Times reported, citing industry
officials and a person with knowledge of the transaction.  A group of U.S. investors that included a  Citigroup Inc .
fund hoped last month to sell Amoun for $1 billion, or more than
three times what they paid in 2006, the newspaper said.  Other transactions in the region are being put on hold, the
Times said, citing Sarah Alexander, the president and chief
executive of the Emerging Markets Private Equity Association in  Washington .  The change in thinking follows a spurt in activity last
year with Egyptian and Saudi Arabian companies accounting for
most purchases, the newspaper added. Intial public offerings
will also remain weak after the 10 Arab exchanges lost almost
$50 billion in value in the last week of January, the newspaper
said, citing Kamco, the asset management arm of Kipco, a Kuwait-
based investment firm.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
