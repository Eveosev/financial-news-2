  Frigoglass SA , a supplier of custom-
made refrigeration equipment to brewers and soft-drink makers,
expects profit to grow again this year after posting an almost
six-fold increase in 2010, said Managing Director Petros Diamantidis.  “We do expect that in 2011 we will see a continuation of
the positive momentum that we have seen in 2010,” Diamantidis
said in a telephone interview today. “We can confirm that 2011
will be another growth year for us.”  Net income last year rose to 20.5 million euros ($27.8
million) from 3 million euros in 2009, according to an e-mailed
statement today. Revenue increased to 457.2 million euros from
346.7 million euros.  Frigoglass is concerned about rising commodity prices with
copper trading at historical highs, Diamantidis said.  “For 2011, input costs will be one of the important
challenges we will have to face,” he said.  Copper for delivery in three months advanced 32 percent in
the last year, falling 1.4 percent today $9,670 a metric ton by
9:36 a.m. on the London Metal Exchange.  Asia and Oceania sales gained 18 percent to almost 89
million euros. The company is “quite pleased” with its
presence in Asia and  Africa , Diamantidis said. Financial
flexibility will allow Frigoglass to continue pursuing
“attractive opportunities,” he said, without giving any
details.  Sales in Eastern Europe advanced 89 percent to 131.4
million euros, primarily driven by  Russia . Revenue in Africa and
the Middle East rose 21 percent to 75.4 million euros.  The company plans to invest about 38 million euros this
year in machinery upgrades and to optimize efficiency and
capacity, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
