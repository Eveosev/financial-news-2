  Ternium SA , Latin America’s second-
largest steelmaker, said fourth-quarter profit fell 51 percent
as higher raw material prices offset an increase in shipments.  Net income dropped to $77.5 million, or 39 cents per
American depositary share, from $159.3 million, or 79 cents a
share, a year earlier, Ternium, based in Luxembourg, said today
in an e-mailed statement. Net sales rose 41 percent to $1.93
billion as the global economy recovered from recession.  “The improvement in sales, which mainly took place in
Mexico, is because in 2009 the recession was going on,” Walter
Chiaravesio, an analyst at Santander Rio, said in a telephone
interview Feb. 21 from  Buenos Aires . He has a “buy” rating on
the stock and doesn’t own any.  “Cost per ton increased year-over-year mainly as a result
of higher raw material and purchased slab prices,” the company
said in the statement.  The earnings report was released before the opening of
regular trading in North American stock markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
