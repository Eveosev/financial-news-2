The supply of gas from  Libya  to  Italy  through a Mediterranean pipeline is slowing down and will
probably stop, said two people with knowledge of the situation.  Gas is coming through  Eni SpA’s Greenstream pipeline  from
Libya to Gela in Sicily in fits and starts, the people said,
declining to be identified because the information is
confidential. The flow may cease later today, they said.  During the past three months, daily imports into Gela have
ranged from 24.5 million cubic meters to 29.7 million cubic
meters, accounting for 8.7 percent to 12.5 percent of total
imports by Italy’s gas network operator Snam Rete Gas Spa. Rome-
based Eni is the majority shareholder in Snam.  An Eni spokesman wasn’t immediately available to comment.  Italian Industry Ministry Undersecretary Stefano Saglia
told Ansa newswire today that while gas supplies have not been
interrupted for the moment, the country is ready to use gas
stocks if needed.  Diplomats resigned and soldiers deserted in protest after
violent repression of anti-government demonstrators left
hundreds dead in Libya, North Africa’s largest oil producer.
Uprisings against political repression and economic stagnation
have already toppled autocratic regimes in Tunisia and Egypt.  Oil prices  jumped to a two-year high in  New York  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
