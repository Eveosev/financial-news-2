U.S. stocks trimmed losses after a
gauge of  consumer confidence  rose more than economists forecast,
helping the market recover some of an earlier slide triggered by
growing violence in Libya.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.8 percent to
1,332.18 at 10:01 a.m. in  New York  after sinking as much as 1.3
percent earlier. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  lost 56.27
points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,2334.98, paring a tumble of as much
as 121 points.      The Conference Board’s index of sentiment increased to
70.4, the highest since February 2008, from 64.8 the prior
month, figures from the New York-based private research group
showed today. Economists projected the gauge would be little
changed at 65.5, according to the median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey.  The  S&P 500  has risen for three straight weeks as corporate
profits surpassed analysts’ estimates for the eighth straight
quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Reports have
also shown an improving economy, with the Institute for Supply
Management-Chicago Inc. saying businesses expanded last month at
the fastest pace since 1988.  The S&P 500 ended last week at the highest level since June
2008 after almost doubling from its bear-market low in 2009.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
