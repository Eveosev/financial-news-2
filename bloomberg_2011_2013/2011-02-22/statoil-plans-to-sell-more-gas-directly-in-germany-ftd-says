Statoil ASA plans to sell more
natural gas directly to industrial companies and other end users
in Germany as liberalized market structures in the country
facilitate access,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported, citing
Rune Bjoernson, who heads Statoil’s international gas business.  Long-term delivery contracts with utilities including  E.ON
AG  will continue to make up the bulk of the company’s operations
in Germany, the newspaper cited Bjoernson as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
