Ukraine exported 7.2 million metric
tons of grains between July 1 and the middle of February,
UkrAgroConsult said.  Wheat accounted for 2.65 million tons of shipments, of
which 60 percent was milling wheat, the Kiev-based researcher
said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday. Ukraine fulfilled
about 49 percent of its grain-export potential in the period,
UkrAgroConsult estimated.  The country could ship out another 2.5 million tons of
wheat through June of this year if grain-export quotas were
removed, according to the researcher. The government imposed the
caps last year in an effort to curb domestic prices for cereals
and food.  The restrictions are scheduled to remain in force through
March, unless the cabinet decides to limit sales until the
current season ends on June 30. Ukrainian grain exports might
exceed 7 million tons from February through June if the caps
were removed, UkrAgroConsult said.  An extension of the quotas “looks more likely,” the
researcher said, pointing to rising domestic wheat and flour
prices as “an excuse” to keep the restrictions in place.  To contact the reporter on this story:
