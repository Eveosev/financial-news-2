  Saudi Arabia  and France agreed to
cooperate on developing nuclear energy for peaceful purposes as
the world’s top oil producer seeks to meet growing demand for
electricity.  The agreement allows the two countries to cooperate in the
fields of production, use and transfer of knowledge of peaceful
uses of nuclear energy, according to an e-mailed statement from
the Saudi government.  “Saudi Arabia has decided to make use of alternative
energy resources, such as atomic energy, solar energy,
geothermal energy and wind energy,” according to the statement,
which cited Hashim Bin Abdullah Yamani, president of the King
Abdullah City for Atomic and  Renewable Energy , known as KA-CARE.
Power demand is forecast to increase by 8 percent a year in the
Arabian Peninsula’s most populous country.  Yamani and  France ’s Minister of Industry and Power Eric Besson signed the agreement. KA-CARE was established by a royal
decree last April to develop the kingdom’s policy of atomic and
renewable energy policies, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
