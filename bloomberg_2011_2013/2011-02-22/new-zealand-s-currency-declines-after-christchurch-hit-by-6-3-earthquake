  New Zealand ’s currency slid to the
lowest since December against the U.S. dollar after a magnitude
6.3 earthquake killed at least 65 people and toppled buildings
in Christchurch, the nation’s second-largest city.  The kiwi, as the  New Zealand dollar  is nicknamed, slid
versus all of its 16 most-traded counterparts after the temblor,
which followed a quake in September. The kiwi and Australia’s
dollar also fell as investors sold higher-yielding assets after
violence flared in Libya.  “The earthquake has caught the market in a risk-averse
mood anyway with the yen strengthening and oil prices rising on
tensions in the Middle East,” said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a
currency strategist in Singapore at Westpac Banking Corp,  Australia ’s second-largest lender.  New Zealand’s dollar dropped as much as 2.4 percent to
touch 74.55 U.S. cents, the lowest level since Dec. 23, before
trading at 74.85 U.S. cents at 12:41 p.m. in New York, down 2
percent from 76.38 cents yesterday. It tumbled as much as 2.7
percent to 61.83 yen, the weakest level since Dec. 23. The
kiwi’s declines against both currencies were the biggest on an
intraday basis since July.  Australia’s currency weakened 1 percent to 99.94 U.S.
cents, from $1.0094, and fell 1.4 percent to 82.74 yen.    Stephen Roberts , a senior economist at Nomura Australia
Ltd., predicted damage and disruption from today’s earthquake
may lower New Zealand’s first-quarter gross domestic product to
“about flat” from the 0.8 percent he forecast previously. The
central bank will likely raise its benchmark rate by 25 basis
points this year to 3.25 percent, he said, cutting an earlier
estimate for three rate increases beginning in April.  Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  said today he’s leader of a
revolution that requires “sacrifice until the end of life,”
defying a widening revolt that has left corpses on the streets
in the capital, Tripoli, and rebels claiming control of the
second-biggest city, Benghazi. He spoke on state television.  To contact the reporter on this story:
