Turkey’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index  retreated for a second day, dropping 470.24, or 0.7
percent, to 64,658.76 at the 5:30 p.m. close of trading in
Istanbul.  The following stocks were active. Symbols are in
parentheses.  Ford Otomotiv Sanay AS (FROTO TI), Ford Motor Co.’s Turkey
unit, rose 30 kurus, or 2.3 percent, to 13.65 liras. The company
was upgraded today to “market perform” at Oyak Securities and to
“outperform” at Eczabasi Securities. Net income for 2010 jumped
to 504.6 million liras ($316.5 million) from 333.4 million liras
in 2009, it said in a statement to the exchange after the
markets closed yesterday.    Tekfen Holding AS  (TKFEN TI), a builder, lost 6 kurus, or 1
percent, to hit an almost five-month low of 5.80 liras at the
close as unrest continued in North Africa. The company said
yesterday that it was evacuating employees and temporarily
suspending work on $140 million of unfinished contracts in
Libya, and that its machinery had been looted there.    Turk Hava Yollari  AO (THYAO TI), the national airline known
as Turkish Airlines, also dropped on continuing Mideast unrest,
losing 16 kurus, or 3.3 percent, to 4.70 liras, its lowest close
since Aug. 25, 2010. The company gets 18 percent of its revenue
from the Middle East and North Africa region, according to
Bloomberg data. Crude oil jumped as much as $8.77 to $98.48 a
barrel in  New York . A $1 increase in the price of crude oil
boosts airline industry costs by about $1.6 billion, according
to the  International Air Transport Association , a trade group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
