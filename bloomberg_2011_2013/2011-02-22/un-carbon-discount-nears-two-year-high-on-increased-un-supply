The discount of United Nations
emission credits compared with European Union permits widened to
near its biggest level in almost two years after regulators
increased the supply of new credits.  A decision to change the time when developers of projects
can claim Certified Emission Reduction credits will boost supply
through 2012 and encourage abatement efforts, Camco
International Ltd., a London-based developer of greenhouse-gas
project, said today. UN credits can be used for compliance in
the EU carbon program, the biggest emissions market.  The discount for December 2012, traded as a separate
contract, widened 1.6 percent to 4.36 euros ($5.96) a metric ton
on the ICE Futures Europe exchange as of 2:30 p.m. and was as
wide as 4.40 euros earlier today. The spread traded as high as
4.45 euros on Nov. 29, the biggest discount since May 2009.  The executive board of the Clean Development Mechanism
decided Feb. 18 to move registration to “the date on which a
complete request for registration has been submitted,”
according to a  meeting report  on the website of the UN Framework
Convention on  Climate Change . Registration previously was
effective at the end of the approval process.  The change will mean developers get credits and potentially
cash from selling them as much as a year sooner, Yariv Cohen,
Camco president, said in an interview today. The change may
bring forward credits by at least two months, he said. “This is
good news for everyone.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
