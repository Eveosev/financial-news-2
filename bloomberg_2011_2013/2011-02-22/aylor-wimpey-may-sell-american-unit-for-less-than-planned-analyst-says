  Taylor Wimpey Plc , the U.K.’s
second-largest homebuilder by volume, may raise less money than
planned from the sale of its North America operations because of
the U.S. market’s weakness, an analyst at Susquehanna
International Group LLP said.  Taylor Wimpey is in talks to sell the Scottsdale, Arizona-
based unit, Taylor Morrison Inc., and values its net assets at
500 million pounds to 600 million pounds ($806 million to $968
million), Chief Executive Officer Peter Redfern said in a Jan.
18 interview. Today, a report showed that residential real-
estate prices in the U.S. fell in the 12 months to December by
the most in a year.    House prices  are down again,” Jack Micenko, an analyst
at Susquehanna in  New York  said by telephone. Taylor Morrison
“isn’t worth $800 million today.”  The S&P/Case-Shiller index of home values in 20 U.S. cities
fell 2.4 percent. The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News projected a 2.3 percent decline.  “We’re not able to disclose anything specifically
regarding what the pricing or valuation would be,” said Anjali Unnikrishnan, a spokeswoman for Taylor Wimpey. The London-based
company plans to use the proceeds from the sale to pay down debt
and buy land in the U.K., Redfern said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
