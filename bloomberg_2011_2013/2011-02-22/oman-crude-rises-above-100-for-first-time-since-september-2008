Oman crude oil futures, a Persian
Gulf benchmark for  Asia , rose to over $100 a barrel on concerns
that political demonstrations in  Libya  may disrupt supplies.  Oman futures for April delivery gained $6.75 to $104.95 a
barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 4:53 p.m. Singapore
time, with 2,540 contracts traded. That’s the most since Sept.
30, 2008. The contract will settle today because of the
President’s Day holiday in the U.S. The settlement price was set
at $100.62 at 12:30 p.m. Dubai time.  Libya shipped only about 14 percent of its crude to Asia in
2009 with the majority going to  France , Italy,  Germany  and  Spain , according to data from a report today by the oil
consultants The Schork Group Inc. Refiners are concerned that
the loss of the North African country’s 1.6 million barrel-a-day
capacity could cause short-term trade disruptions.  Murban for April loading, produced by Abu Dhabi National
Oil Co., remained at a premium of 18 cents a barrel to its
official selling price, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Qatar Marine gained 8 cents to a discount of 5 cents a barrel,
Bloomberg data showed.  Oman oil for immediate loading rose $2.92, or 2.9 percent,
to $103.62 a barrel today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Dubai for loading in April was up 2.9 percent to
$103.35. Murban crude climbed 2.8 percent to $106.56.  The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps for April, or EFS,
widened 60 cents to $4.70 a barrel, according to data from PVM
Oil Associates Ltd. The exchange for swaps for May increased 41
cents to $4.64.  To contact the reporter on this story:
