The Commodity Futures Trading
Commission said it has fined  Cantor Fitzgerald  & Co. $100,000
for engaging in wash sales and non-competitive trades on
gasoline futures.  “On one or more occasions from March through April 2007, a
then-employee of Cantor simultaneously entered orders with
certain floor brokers from two different floor brokerage
operations to buy and sell” gasoline futures for the same
quantity, price and contract month, the Washington-based CFTC
said today in a statement.  The employee prearranged the purchase and sale of hundreds
of gasoline contracts traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the commission said. Wash sales, buying shares at one
broker while simultaneously selling through another, may be
designed to make trading appear more active than it really is.  Cantor neither admitted nor denied the commission’s
findings, according to the CFTC order. Sandra Lee, a spokeswoman
for the New York-based firm, didn’t immediately return a phone
call seeking comment.  Editors: Joe Link, Richard Stubbe  To contact the reporters on this story:
