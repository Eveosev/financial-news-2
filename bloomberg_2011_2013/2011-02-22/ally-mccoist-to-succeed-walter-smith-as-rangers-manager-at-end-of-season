Ally McCoist will take over as
Rangers manager when Walter Smith steps down after the season,
the Scottish Premier League soccer champion said on its website.  McCoist, 48, has agreed to a one-year rolling contract,
Rangers said. Current coach Kenny McDowall will step up to
become his assistant manager, the Glasgow club said.  McCoist had been the assistant to Smith since 2007 and has
helped Rangers win the past two SPL titles. The club is second
this season, eight points behind city rival Celtic.  “Over the past few years I have been privileged to learn
from one of the greatest managers in world football and Walter’s
record speaks for itself,” McCoist said on Rangers’  website .
“I am delighted to be following in his footsteps and I will do
everything possible to bring further success to this club.”  McCoist scored 355 goals in 581 matches during his playing
career at Rangers from 1983-98. He also had 19 goals for the
Scotland national team and played at the 1990  World Cup  in  Italy .  “First and foremost Ally is a passionate Rangers supporter
who has been a loyal servant to the club both as a player and
more recently assistant manager,” Rangers Chief Executive
Officer Martin Bain said. “He has contributed greatly to our
success over the past four years and that is why we feel he is
the right man to replace Walter.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
