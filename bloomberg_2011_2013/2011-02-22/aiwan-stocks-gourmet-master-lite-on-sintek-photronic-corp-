8,673.67.  Carriers:  China Airlines Ltd . (2610 TT), the island’s
largest carrier, slid 4.7 percent to NT$18.30, the lowest since
Aug. 3, as  oil prices  jumped on political unrest in Libya.  EVA
Airways Corp . (2618 TT), the second largest, sank 6.8 percent to

least 40 percent of the airlines’ total cost, said Stone Lin, an

The operator of Taiwan’s largest coffee-shop chain was cut to

Brandon Chen wrote in a report.  Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. (2317 TT) dropped 2.2
percent to NT$111.50, the lowest since Dec. 2. Apple Inc.’s
shipment of a new version of its iPad tablet computer may be
delayed by two months because of “production bottlenecks” at
manufacturer Hon Hai, Yuanta Securities Co. said in a report
today. The report by Vincent Chen, an analyst at Yuanta, said
the delay could pose a 3 percent decline in Hon Hai’s 2011 net
income.  Jill Tan, an Apple spokeswoman in  Hong Kong , declined to
comment on the report.  Edmund Ding , a spokesman for Hon Hai,
didn’t answer calls to his Taiwan and China mobile phones.  To contact the reporter on this story:
