Nitrates commonly used for chest
pain may also be an inexpensive way to strengthen bone in older
women, a Canadian study suggests.  Nitroglycerin cream applied daily to the upper arms for two
years increased bone density about 7 percent in a  study  of 243
postmenopausal women released today by the Journal of the
American Medical Association. Headaches were reported by 35
percent of women in the first month of treatment and decreased
over time. Serious side effects were similar in the study group
that received a placebo.  An aging population has increased demand for drugs to
prevent costly hip and spine fractures caused by weak bones.
These findings raise the possibility that generic nitroglycerin
may be an affordable alternative to brand-name osteoporosis
medicines led by  Roche Holding AG ’s Boniva,  Novartis AG ’s
Reclast,  Warner Chilcott Plc ’s Actonel and  Amgen Inc .’s Prolia.  “The efficacy of nitrates for reducing risk of fracture
should be tested in a larger randomized controlled trial,”
wrote study author  Sophie A. Jamal , an assistant professor in
the department of medicine at the University of Toronto, and her
colleagues.  Boniva brought in sales of 1.01 billion Swiss francs ($975
million) last year for Basel, Switzerland-based Roche. Novartis,
also of Basel, had sales of $579 million from Reclast. Actonel
sales were $222 million for Ardee, Ireland, based Warner
Chilcott. Prolia, approved June 1, brought in $33 million for
Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
