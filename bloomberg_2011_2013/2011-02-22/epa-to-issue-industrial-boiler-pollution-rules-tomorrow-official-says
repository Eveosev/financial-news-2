The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency will issue new pollution rules for industrial boilers
tomorrow, an EPA official said.  The agency sought in December to postpone for 15 months the
rules, aimed at reducing emissions from boilers through
“maximum achievable control technology,” known as MACT. A
federal judge denied the request last month and ordered the EPA
to act in 30 days. The agency will release the rules tomorrow,
said the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity before
the announcement.  EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson has said the rules will be
“significantly different” from a proposal last year. Companies
and industry groups have said the rules aren’t practical and may
cost industry $20 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
