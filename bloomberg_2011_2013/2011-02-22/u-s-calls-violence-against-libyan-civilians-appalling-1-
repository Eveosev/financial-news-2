Colombia , the second-largest producer
of arabica coffee, said its harvest may rise by as much as 16
percent next year, when coffee growers may begin stock exchange
trading of the Juan Valdez brand of coffee.  Growers may harvest as much as 11 million bags in 2012 from
an estimated 9.5 million bags this year amid efforts to plant
coffee varieties resistant to disease, said Luis Munoz, chief
executive officer of  Colombia’s National Coffee Growers
Federation . The federation controls Procafecol SA, which sells
Juan Valdez coffee at stores in Colombia and abroad.  Arabica coffee has more than doubled in New York in 12
months as storms in Colombia cut exports last year and pushed
the harvest in April to a 15-month low. Higher production
depends partly on improved weather conditions, Munoz said on a
cloudy day in Bogota.  This year, Colombia’s harvest will improve in the last six
months of the year after a “tough” April and May, Munoz said.  Output declined 19 percent in April to 523,000 bags from
647,000 bags a year earlier after storm damage to crops, the
federation said on May 12.  Arabica coffee for July delivery rose 5.10 cents, or 1.9
percent, to $2.7120 a pound at 11:41 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in
 New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
