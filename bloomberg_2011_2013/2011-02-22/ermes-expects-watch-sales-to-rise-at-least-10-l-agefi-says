  Hermes International  SCA expects
sales of watches to increase at least 10 percent this year as it
expands in the Americas,  L’Agefi  said, citing Luc Perramond,
head of the unit.  Hermes gets 5 percent of sales from watches and may double
that proportion within five to eight years, Perramond told the
newspaper, adding that the division is “too dependent” on the
Japanese market and  Asia . The unit’s sales rose 30 percent to
about 113 million euros ($154 million) last year, L’Agefi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
