Zambian judge Irene Mambilima will
head the southern African nation’s  Electoral Commission 
following the resignation of Florence Mumba last month,
commission spokesman Chris Akufuna told Radio Phoenix in the
capital, Lusaka, today.  Mumba resigned after a dispute with the commission’s
executive director, Danny Kalale, whom she dismissed on Jan. 22
the privately owned radio station said.  Zambia is scheduled to hold presidential, parliamentary and
local government elections by October, Radio Phoenix said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
