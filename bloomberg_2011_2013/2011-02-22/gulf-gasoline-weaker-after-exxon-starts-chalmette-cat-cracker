  Gulf Coast  gasoline weakened versus
futures after Exxon Mobil Corp. restarted a gasoline-making unit
at its Chalmette refinery in Louisiana.  The unit, which was shut Jan. 22 for unplanned repairs, was
started over the weekend, Kevin Allexon, a company spokesman,
said in an e-mail today. The unit can process more than 75,000
barrels a day.  The spread for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the Gulf
Coast weakened 0.55 cent to a discount of 5.8 cents a gallon
versus futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at
2:20 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt
delivery rose 6.05 cents to $2.5593.    ConocoPhillips  is conducting planned maintenance at its
Lake Charles refinery in  Louisiana , Rich Johnson, a company
spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement.  Gasoline and heating oil futures surged to their highest
levels in more than 28 months as violence in Libya raised
speculation that Middle Eastern unrest could disrupt oil and
fuel supplies.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor held steady at 1.75 cents a gallon.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel at the East Coast
hub increased 1.12 cents to 8.25 cents.  The premium for California-blend gasoline in San Francisco
dropped 11.25 cents to 13 cents a gallon after  Valero Energy
Corp . started a crude unit at the Benicia, California, plant.
The unit had been shut for maintenance, according to Bill Day, a
company spokesman in San Antonio.  The same fuel in  Los Angeles  slipped 10.25 cents to a
premium of 13 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
