Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Indonesian trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the 4 p.m. Jakarta-time close.  The  Jakarta Composite index  declined 46.54 points, or 1.3
percent, to 3,451.10, falling for a second day.  Banking stocks: PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI IJ), the
nation’s second-biggest bank by assets, retreated 3.1 percent to
4,750 rupiah. PT Bank Negara Indonesia (BBNI IJ), the third-
largest state-owned bank, declined 3.5 percent, 3,425 rupiah.
Banking stocks are the biggest drag on the composite index.  The shares fell as crude oil surged 9.4 percent to $94.26 a
barrel in after-hours trading in  New York , the highest level in
more than two years. A higher oil price may boost inflation and
prompt the central bank to further increase borrowing costs,
said Adrianus Bias Prasuryo, an analyst at PT Samuel Sekuritas  Indonesia  in Jakarta.  PT Astra Agro Lestari (AALI IJ), the biggest listed
plantation company by market value, gained 0.9 percent to 22,250
rupiah. Astra Agro said January crude palm oil sales increased
4.4 percent from a year earlier to 94,991 metric tons. Average
selling price rose 35.7 percent to 8,695 rupiah a kilogram, the
company said.  PT Garuda Indonesia (GIAA IJ), the largest airline,
retreated 3.7 percent to 520 rupiah after crude oil futures rose
to the highest level in more than two years, threatening to
increase the airline’s fuel costs.  PT Medco Energi Internasional (MEDC IJ), the biggest listed
oil company that is developing an oil block in Libya, fell 4
percent to 3,025 rupiah. Medco may shut down its exploration
activities in Libya, Raditya Artono, an analyst at PT Mandiri
Sekuritas in Jakarta, wrote in a note today. Medco’s operation
“isn’t affected much” by protests in  Libya  and the  oil company 
will try to minimize the impact, Director Lukman Mahfoedz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
