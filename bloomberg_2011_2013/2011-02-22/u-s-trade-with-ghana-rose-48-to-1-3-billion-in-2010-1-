Trade between the U.S. and  Ghana 
rose 48 percent to $1.3 billion in 2010, Deputy U.S. Trade
Representative Demetrios Marantis told reporters in Accra, the
Ghanaian capital, today.  Completing a new investment treaty between the two
countries would improve the business climate and “would
demonstrate Ghana’s commitment to an open trade and investment
policy and set an example for others in the region,” Marantis
said.  Opaque business regulation, bad roads and congested ports
are hindering further growth in the West African nation, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
