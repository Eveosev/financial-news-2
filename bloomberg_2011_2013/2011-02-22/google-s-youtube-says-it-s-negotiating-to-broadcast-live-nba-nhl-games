  Google Inc .’s YouTube is in talks
with the  National Basketball Association  and the  National Hockey
League  to show live games, building on the popularity of
cricket’s  Indian Premier League  last year, a Google executive
said.
  Google is in talks with “most pro sports leagues”
including the NBA and NHL, as well as soccer leagues in  Europe ,
Brian Suh, head of YouTube Partnership at Google’s Korean unit,
said. YouTube aims to show more live sports in the second half 
of the year, said Gautam Anand, Google’s director of content 
partnerships for Asia Pacific, in an interview in Seoul 
yesterday.  Adding live sports broadcasts may help YouTube expand
revenue by keeping viewers on its site longer to woo more
advertisers.  YouTube ’s contract to show cricket from the Indian
Premier League, which gives the Google unit a share of ad
revenue from games and the league’s website, brought in 55
million visits from more than 250 countries, Anand said.  “It’s fair to say that there will be a lot more appealing
sports content you’ll see on YouTube,” Anand said. “We have
ongoing conversations with pretty much everyone.”  NHL spokesman Michael DiLorenzo said in a telephone
interview that the league is not in talks to stream live games
over YouTube, nor has it been in discussions about it.  Michael Bass, senior vice president for marketing
communications at the NBA, said, “We’re pleased that YouTube
recognizes the value of live sports.”  Live Streaming  Google shares dropped 3.2 percent to $610.21 in Nasdaq
trading yesterday.  Where new live-streaming services will be offered depends
on each deal, said Lois Kim, a spokeswoman for Google Korea.
YouTube streams Major League Baseball games in Japan, where
major TV broadcasters don’t feature the sporting events.  One of the key goals for YouTube this year is to offer
longer clips of movies and shows under the lead of former  Netflix Inc . executive Robert Kyncl, Anand said. Google also
hired Claude Ruibal, former chief executive and chairman of
Universal Sports, as the head of sports content partnerships for
YouTube this year to boost sports content, Anand said.  Google, which runs the world’s most used Internet search
engine, paid $1.65 billion to buy YouTube in 2006. YouTube
competes with premium-content site Hulu LLC and rental service
Netflix.  Indian League  During the Indian Premier League broadcast, viewers spent
on average 40 minutes watching each match, he said. The company
needs to do more to keep its viewers on the site for longer than
the average daily 15-minute session, compared with the multiple
hours consumers spend in front of televisions, according to
Hunter Walk, director of  product management  at YouTube.  “One of the good things about IPL was that it really
proved to a lot of sports leagues that broad-scale live-
streaming type of exercise is something that’s possible,” Anand
said. “They took notice of IPL and have come to us, and entered
into a lot more serious discussions.”  Google is also trying to offer more live-streamed video
clips in music, such as concerts, Anand said.  YouTube is running advertisements on videos more than 3
billion times a week, a 50 percent increase from May, Shishir Mehrotra, director of product management at YouTube, said this
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
