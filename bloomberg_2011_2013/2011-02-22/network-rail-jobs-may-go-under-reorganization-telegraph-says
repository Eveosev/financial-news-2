Network Rail Ltd. Chief Executive
Officer David Higgins plans to cut some of the 2,000
headquarters staff, the  Daily Telegraph  reported, citing an
unidentified company spokesman.  The not-for-profit company, which manages the U.K.’s rail
system, may run into criticism over its plans to offer
“significant six-figure salaries” to managers who will have
increased authority under Higgins’ reorganization plans, the
newspaper said, without saying where it obtained the
information.  Transport Secretary Philip Hammond has already criticized
the organization for paying bonuses worth 2.25 million pounds
($3.64 million) to staff last year, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
