  Comcast Corp .’s NBC acquired rights
to show the Belmont Stakes, enabling the network to show all
three legs of horse racing’s Triple Crown.  NBC Sports also renewed its agreement to show the Preakness
Stakes to go along with the  Kentucky Derby . It now has rights
for all three races from this year through 2015.  Comcast, which took control of NBC Universal last month,
will use its Versus channel to show some of the Preakness and
Belmont coverage, such as the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes for
fillies at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore and other race-day
coverage at Belmont Park outside  New York .  “We are now uniquely positioned to significantly expand
the reach of these iconic events with extensive coverage on
Versus,” Dick Ebersol, chairman of NBC Sports Group, said in a
statement.  Financial details of the agreement weren’t disclosed.  This marks the first time since 2005 that all three races
will be aired on the same network.  Walt Disney Co .’s ABC
televised the Belmont Stakes for the past five years.  Versus and NBC Sports will broadcast more than 25 hours of
programming associated with the races, according to the news
release. Coverage also will include the  Kentucky  Oaks race for
fillies. A schedule will be released later.  The Derby is schedule to be run at Churchill Downs in
Louisville, Kentucky, on May 7, the Preakness on May 21 and the
Belmont on June 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
