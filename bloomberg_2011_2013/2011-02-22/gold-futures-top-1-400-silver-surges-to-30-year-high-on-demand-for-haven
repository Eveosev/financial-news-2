Gold topped $1,400 an ounce in  New
York  and silver surged to the highest in 30 years as unrest in
the Middle East boosted demand for precious metals as a haven.  The Libyan government attacked protesters, and rebels
claimed control of the second-biggest city, Benghazi. Tens of
thousands of Bahraini protesters marched in the capital
demanding democracy. Gold has rallied 26 percent in the past
year, while silver doubled.  “Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and North Africa
region continue to fester, keeping  risk aversion  elevated and
enhancing the appeal of safe-haven assets,” Marc Ground, an
analyst at Standard Bank Plc in Johannesburg, said in a report.  Gold futures for April delivery rose $12.50, or 0.9
percent, to settle at $1,401.10 at 1:51 p.m. on the Comex. The
metal reached a record of $1,432.50 on Dec. 7. The Comex was
closed yesterday for a holiday.  Bullion for immediate delivery fell $5.86, or 0.1 percent,
to $1,400.58 in  London , after touching $1,410.75.  Silver futures for May delivery gained 57.1 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $32.856 an ounce on the Comex, after reaching
$34.315, the highest since March 1980.  “Silver is still relatively attractive compared to gold,”
said James Dailey, who manages about $200 million at TEAM
Financial Asset Management LLC in Harrisburg,  Pennsylvania .
“The more volatile the metal, the better it’s going to
perform.”  Palladium futures for June delivery dropped $52.05, or 6.1
percent, to $807.40 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the biggest decline since Nov. 10. Platinum futures
for April delivery fell $57, or 3.1 percent, to $1,786.30 an
ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporters on this story:
