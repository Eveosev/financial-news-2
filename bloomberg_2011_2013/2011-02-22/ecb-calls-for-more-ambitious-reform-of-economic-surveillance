The  European Central Bank  said
European Commission proposals to strengthen economic and
budgetary discipline are not far-reaching enough to help restore
confidence in the 17-nation currency region.  “A more ambitious governance structure must be foreseen,
to ensure the smooth functioning” of the monetary union, the
Frankfurt-based ECB said in a statement today. Member states
must “take advantage of the ongoing legislative process to
strengthen the economic governance package to the maximum
allowed under the current treaties.”  European leaders aim to reach an agreement next month on a
“comprehensive” package of budget-oversight reforms, including
stiffer and more-automatic sanctions against countries breaching
the region’s deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic
product. The fiscal rules have gone unenforced since the euro’s
launch in 1999, sparking a debt crisis last year.  The ECB called for “greater automacity” in all
surveillance procedures and said “strict deadlines to avoid
lengthy procedures” are warranted to improve fiscal soundness.
The central bank also said it’s important for member states to
“swiftly implement strong national budgetary frameworks in
order to facilitate compliance with their obligations under the
Stability and Growth Pact.”  The EU should “consider reversing the changes to the
Stability and Growth Pact of 2005,” which gave countries
“greater leeway” and “at some point in time” reform the
treaty to improve fiscal policies, the ECB said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
