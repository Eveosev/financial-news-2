  AS Merko Ehitus , the biggest listed
Baltic builder, fell the most in more than eight months in
Tallinn trade after reporting a wider fourth-quarter loss.  The stock fell as much as 7.9 percent at the opening, the
biggest decline since June 15, 2010, trading 6.3 percent lower
at 9.6 euros at 10:20 a.m. The stock has risen 6.1 percent this
year, compared with an average gain of 5.7 percent for its
eastern European Industrials peers, according to Bloomberg data.  Merko earlier reported a fourth-quarter net loss of 4
million euros ($5.4 million), compared with a loss of 175,000
euros a year earlier, citing a faster-than-expected increase in
construction prices. The group’s annual return on equity
declined to 0.9 percent last year, compared with 5.5 percent in
2009 and its long-term target of at least 15 percent.  Merko competes with local  AS Nordecon International , and
units of Finnish YIT OYJ and  Sweden ’s Skanska AB, and said last
year it aims to grow through acquisitions in Latvia and
Lithuania.  To contact the reporter on this story:
