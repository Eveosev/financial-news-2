Malaysia’s ringgit fell by the most
in two months on concern investors will seek the perceived
safety of the  U.S. dollar  as political turmoil in the Middle
East escalated.  The currency retreated from a 13-year high after violent
protests in  Libya  followed unrest in Egypt, Bahrain and Yemen.
The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of regional stocks slumped by the
most in a month as the Dollar Index traded on ICE Futures in  New
York  rose for a second day.  Government bonds  declined on concern
higher oil prices will stoke inflation.  “The attention is all on the Middle East and the risk of
this spreading to other troubled spots,” said D. Sivadass, a
currency forwards trader at EON Capital Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur.
“We are going to see some strong safe-haven” demand, he said.  The ringgit dropped 0.5 percent to 3.0540 per dollar as of
4:20 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, the biggest one-day loss since Dec. 15. It reached
3.0240 yesterday, the strongest level since October 1997.  The extra yield investors demand to own emerging-market
debt increased seven basis points to 269, the highest this
month, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. The EMBI+ spread, which
measures the risk premium on developing nations’ debt over U.S.
Treasuries, has climbed from a four-year low of 221.5 points on
Jan. 5.  Libyan security forces attacked anti-government protesters
as demonstrations spread across the Middle East and North
Africa, a region that accounts for 36 percent of global crude-
oil output. Crude oil surged 8.5 percent to $93.50 a barrel, the
highest level since Oct. 4, 2008.  Bonds Decline  Ten-year notes fell as higher  oil prices  may increase the
government’s fuel subsidies bill, making it harder to cut its  budget deficit .  The yield on 4.16 percent bond due July 2021 increased one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 4.06 percent,
according to Bursa Malaysia. The price dropped 0.04, or 40 sen
per 1,000 ringgit face amount, to 4.06 percent.  Consumer prices in Southeast Asia’s third-largest economy

percent in December from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
