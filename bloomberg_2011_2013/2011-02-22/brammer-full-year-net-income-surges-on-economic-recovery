  Brammer Plc , a U.K. distributor of
bearings and power-transmission products, said profit jumped in
2010 after a “strong recovery” in the European economy boosted
sales.  Net income rose to 13.8 million pounds ($22 million), or 13
pence a share, from 58,000 pounds, or 0.1 penny, a year earlier,
the Manchester, England-based company said today in a  statement .
Revenue rose 9.9 percent to 468.4 million pounds.  “The outcome indicates a continuance of both the recovery,
which became evident towards the end of the first quarter of
2010, and further market-share gains,” Chairman David Dunn said
in the statement. “The early evidence in 2011 is encouraging,”
with sales in January at operations open at least a year rising
by more than 20 percent.  Brammer had called business in 2009 the “most difficult in
recent times” after sales slumped amid the U.K.’s deepest
recession since World War II. Earnings that year were held back
by a 12.9 million-pound charge for eliminating jobs and reducing
inventory, which the company said reduced annual operating costs
by 15.8 million pounds.  Sales growth in 2010 was propelled by a 35 percent jump at
its food and drink equipment business and a 32 percent gain at
the pulp and paper machinery unit, Brammer said. Earnings before
interest, taxes and amortization and excluding exceptional items
or currency shifts rose 30 percent, led by jumps of 63 percent
in  Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxembourg, 41 percent in the
U.K. and 26 percent in eastern  Europe .  Brammer declined as much as 0.5 percent to 251.75 pence and
was down 0.4 percent as of 8:50 a.m. in  London  trading. That
pared the stock’s gain for this year to 0.8 percent.  The company plans a final dividend of 4.5 pence a share, an
increase of 25 percent from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
