  Gas Natural SDG SA , Spain’s largest
gas supplier, dropped in  Madrid  trading after saying it made a
provision to cover a dispute over fuel supplies with  Algeria ’s
Sonatrach and as full-year profit fell short of estimates.  The stock fell 0.8 percent to close at 12.325 euros in
Madrid. Gas Natural is up 7.3 percent this year, giving the
company a market value of 11.4 billion euros ($16 billion).  Full-year 2010 net income rose 0.5 percent to 1.2 billion
euros, the Barcelona-based company said today, missing the 1.34
billion-euro mean analysts’ estimate in a Bloomberg survey. The
company said an additional provision “conditioned earnings,”
without specifying its value or the effect on its profit.  Gas Natural is challenging a ruling by an arbitration court
that recognized the right of Algerian state-controlled Sonatrach
to boost the price of gas supplied to  Spain  since 2007 through
the Maghreb Europe pipeline. Gas Natural has said the decision
has a maximum retroactive effect of $1.97 billion.  The company today said it’s in talks with Sonatrach on the
revisions and that it expects a result that is “beneficial to
both sides.”  Mahgreb Pipeline  The Maghreb pipeline crosses  Morocco  and extends into Spain
and  Portugal . Algeria, a member of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, has a production capacity of 1.4 million
barrels a day of oil and exports about 60 billion cubic meters a
year of gas.  Spain also imports gas by ship using six regasification
terminals that turn liquefied natural gas back into gas. The
country is  Europe ’s biggest importer of LNG.  Gas Natural has not offered stock to Sonatrach as a way of
solving the dispute, Gas Natural Chief Executive Officer Rafael Villaseca said today on a conference call.  The company’s board is proposing to sell as much as 413
million euros in stock to offer investors the possibility of
receiving shares as part of the 2010 dividend.  Gas Natural in July said it aimed to boost dividends by at
least 10 percent a year on average from 2010 to 2014. It targets
net income of about 1.5 billion euros in 2012 and earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of more than
5 billion euros. Ebitda increased 14 percent to 4.48 billion
euros in 2010, the company said today.  Investment Slowed  The Spanish natural gas company completed buying rival
utility Union Fenosa SA in 2009, gaining access to gas-
liquefaction and regasification plants as well as electricity-
generation capacity. It plans to invest at a slower pace through
2012 as it tries to cut debt following the acquisition.  Average annual gross investment will fall to 1.8 billion
euros a year from 2010 through 2012 from about 2.1 billion euros
in 2009 as the company spends on its distribution and generation
units, Gas Natural said on July 27. The company plans to cut net
debt to between 15 billion euros and 16 billion euros in 2012.  Net debt fell to 19.1 billion euros at the end of December
from 20.9 billion euros a year earlier. Gas Natural said it’s
discussing the sale of the Arrubal power plant with 800
megawatts of capacity, part of a plan to sell gas-fired
generators to meet competition rules after buying Fenosa.  Gas Demand  Gas Natural had electricity generation capacity of 17,305
megawatts in Spain and abroad at the end of December. So-called
combined cycle power plants accounted for 63 percent, hydropower
11 percent and coal-fired plants 12 percent of capacity. Spanish
gas demand fell 0.3 percent in 2010 after an 11 percent drop in
2009.  The company has said it may add 1,200 megawatts of
renewable-energy capacity in Spain by 2014 and forecasts its
installed capacity will range between 15,600 megawatts and
17,700 megawatts in 2014.  Gas Natural is controlled by oil company Repsol YPF SA and
Criteria Caixa Corp., which together own about 67 percent. GDF
Suez SA, owner of Europe’s biggest natural gas network, in
September sold its 5 percent stake in Gas Natural.  To contact the reporter on this story:
