The Saints terminated the contract
of tight end Jeremy Shockey, who scored a fourth-quarter
touchdown that gave  New Orleans  the lead for good in its 2010
Super Bowl victory against Indianapolis.  Shockey played three seasons with the Saints after joining
them from the  New York Giants  prior to the 2008 season. The 30-
year-old caught 139 passes for 1,460 yards and six touchdowns in
38 regular-season games for New Orleans. He had 41 receptions
for 408 yards last season, the fewest in both categories in his
nine-year National Football League career.  Picked in the first round of the 2002  NFL draft  by the
Giants, Shockey played in 83 games over six years for  New York ,
amassing 371 receptions and 27 touchdowns.  “Jeremy played an important role in helping our team bring
a  Super Bowl  championship to New Orleans,” Saints coach Sean Payton said in a  statement  today on the team’s website. “He
contributed to the success of our offense, both as a pass
catcher and run blocker, and we’re appreciative of his
efforts.”  A four-time Pro Bowl selection, Shockey caught a 2-yard
pass from quarterback Drew Brees to give the Saints a 24-17 lead
against the Indianapolis Colts in last year’s Super Bowl. Tracy Porter then scored on a 74-yard interception return to seal the
Saints’ first NFL title.  To contact the reporter on this story:
