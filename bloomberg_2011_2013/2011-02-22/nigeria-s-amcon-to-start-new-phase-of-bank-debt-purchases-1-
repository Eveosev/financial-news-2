Asset Management Corp. of  Nigeria , a
state-owned company, is seeking approval from the central bank
to start the second phase of its program to buy bad debts from
banks, Chief Executive Officer Mustapha Chike-Obi said.  “Non-performing loans to be purchased under the second
phase will be from the healthy banks and others we missed in the
first phase,” Chike-Obi said in a telephone interview from
Lagos today.  Amcon, as the company is known, on Dec. 31 signed debt
purchase agreements with 21 of Nigeria’s 24 banks and issued
1.04 trillion naira ($6.8 billion) of so-called consideration
bonds that are not tradable to buy non-performing loans from
them. The corporation will begin negotiations with borrowers of
the debts, he said.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  in 2009 bailed out the banking
industry with 620 billion naira and fired eight bank chiefs
after a debt crisis threatened it with collapse.  Amcon delayed issuing 1.5 trillion naira of bonds on Jan.
31 because it had not obtained all regulatory approvals, Foluke
Dosumu, executive director for finance, said that day. Part of
the debt will replace the consideration bonds and will be
tradable.  “The hard deadline” for the bond issuance is March 31,
while the recapitalization of the bailed-out banks will be
completed in the second quarter, Chike-Obi said today.  The Nigerian Stock Exchange All Share Index climbed for a
fourth day, rising 0.1 percent to 26,747.04 by the 2:30 p.m.
close in Lagos, according to figures e-mailed today by the
bourse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
