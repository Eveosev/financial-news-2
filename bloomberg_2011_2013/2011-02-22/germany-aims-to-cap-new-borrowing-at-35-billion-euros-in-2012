  Germany  aims to cap new borrowing at
35 billion euros ($48 billion) next year, below the amount
targeted in the medium-term budget plan, said a senior member of
Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party.  After a shortfall of 44 billion euros last year, the
government seeks to sell around 40 billion euros of debt in 2011
and no more than 35 billion euros next year, according to  Norbert Barthle , budget spokesman for Merkel’s Christian
Democratic Union.  “We are confident that the maximum borrowing requirement
for 2012 can be set at 35 billion euros,” Barthle said today in
an interview in Berlin. Lawmakers from Merkel’s coalition will
make sure that borrowing will stay well below the limits imposed
by the so-called debt brake in the constitution, he said.  Lawmakers from Merkel’s bloc have said  Europe ’s biggest
economy must set an example of budgetary discipline in the
European Union to help influence policy-making in over-indebted
euro countries such as  Greece .  The government’s medium-term budget plan calls for
borrowing of 48.4 billion euros this year and 40.1 billion euros
in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
