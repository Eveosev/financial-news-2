  Man Group Plc  will expand its
business in  Asia  and may hire hedge-fund manager teams in the
region,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing an interview with Chief
Executive Officer Peter Clarke.  While Man Group aims to be closer to its Asian customers
and plans to invest more money in the region, no big
acquisitions are planned there, the newspaper said.  The number of hedge funds will diminish in the next 10
years and they will have more money under management, Clarke
told Handelsblatt.  To contact the reporters on this story:
