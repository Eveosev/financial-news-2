The Philippine peso slid the most in
a month on speculation investors are selling emerging-market
assets as the political turmoil in the Middle East intensifies.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia  Dollar Index fell for a second
day after Libya, which holds the biggest oil reserves in  Africa ,
erupted into violence last night that the International
Federation for Human Rights says has killed more than 300
people. Benchmark three-year bonds dropped, snapping a two-day
rally, before a government auction today of 20 billion pesos
($461 million) of five- and 10-year debt targeted at individual
investors.  “The uncertainties regarding the Middle East are causing
some  risk aversion , providing ammunition for the market to cover
their short-dollar positions,” said Rafael Algarra, a treasurer
at Security Bank Corp. in Manila. A short position is a bet that
an asset will decline in value.  The peso dropped 0.5 percent, the most since Jan. 20, to
43.625 per dollar as of 11:09 a.m. in  Manila , according to
Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency has advanced 1.6 percent this
month, the third-best performance among Asia’s 10 most-traded
currencies.  The yield on the 6.25 percent bond due January 2014 climbed
12.5 basis points to 5.35 percent, according to Tradition
Financial Services. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter for this story:
