The euro may weaken to a five-month
low against the dollar after dropping below key technical levels
today, Ueda Harlow Ltd. said, citing trading patterns.  Downward pressure is mounting on the single currency after
it fell below its 5- and 20-day moving averages, said Toshiya Yamauchi, a senior currency analyst at the foreign-exchange
margin-trading company in Tokyo. The currency is now poised to
decline toward a trend line connecting the high reached on Jan.
4 and the low touched on Feb. 14, Yamauchi said.  “As its momentum deteriorates, the euro is likely to test
lower prices,” Yamauchi said in an interview. “The currency is
poised for an adjustment.”  The euro traded at $1.3603 as of 11:28 a.m. in Tokyo, after
falling as low as $1.3587 earlier today. The five-day moving
average was at $1.3628 and the 20-day average was at $1.3641.  Should the common currency decline below the trend line, it
may extend losses to the level of $1.2969 reached on Nov. 30 or
to this year’s low of $1.2867 touched on Jan. 10, Yamauchi said.
The last time the euro traded below $1.2867 was Sept. 14,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
