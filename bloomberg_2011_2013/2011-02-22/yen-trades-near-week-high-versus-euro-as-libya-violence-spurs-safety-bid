The yen was within 0.9 percent of a
one-week high against the euro as concern that violence in  Libya 
will escalate boosted demand for Japan’s currency as a refuge.  The yen maintained gains against most of its 16 major
counterparts after global stocks fell and oil surged as violence
intensified in the holder of  Africa ’s largest crude reserves.
The dollar retreated from a one-week high against the euro as
Treasury yields fell before a report forecast to show U.S.
existing home sales declined last month.  “Given how quickly protests are spreading in the Mideast,
there’s nervousness over which country could be next,” said
Khoon Goh, head of market economics and strategy at ANZ National
Bank Ltd. in Wellington. “Markets may remain in risk-off mode
and safe-haven currencies such as the franc and the yen could be
bought.”  The yen was at 113.12 per euro as of 8:22 a.m. in Tokyo
from 112.99 in  New York  yesterday, when it reached 112.24, the
strongest since Feb. 14. The yen traded at 82.72 per dollar from
82.77. The dollar was at $1.3676 per euro from $1.3650, after
touching $1.3525 yesterday, the highest since Feb. 16.  The franc was at 1.2820 per euro from 1.2817, after
reaching 1.2792 yesterday, the strongest level since Jan. 31. It
was at 93.74 centimes per dollar from 93.89.  Continued protests “will lead to civil war,” Libyan
leader  Muammar Qaddafi  said in Tripoli. Qaddafi’s crackdown on a
week-long uprising has already left more than 200 dead,
according to  Human Rights Watch . Oil climbed on concern turmoil
in North Africa and the Mideast will disrupt supplies. Crude oil
for March delivery surged as much as 9.7 percent to $94.49 a
barrel in New York, the highest level since October 2008.  The MSCI World Index of shares fell 1.5 percent and
Treasury 10-year yields dropped 13 basis points to 3.45 percent
yesterday.  Sales of U.S. previously owned homes fell 1.1 percent to a
5.22 million annual rate in January, according to the median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey before the
National Association of Realtors reports the data today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
