The  Houston Ship Channel , which
links the Gulf of Mexico to the cityâ€™s oil refineries, is closed
because of fog, an official at Houston Pilots said.  About 40 ships are waiting to enter the port and 11 are
awaiting departure, said the official, who declined to give his
name. The link closed yesterday at 4:40 p.m. local time and will
probably face further disruptions until Feb. 26, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
