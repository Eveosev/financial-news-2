A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S spends at
least $100 million per year on costs related to avoiding pirate
attacks, RB-Borsen reported, citing Eivind Kolding, the head of
the Copenhagen-based companyâ€™s container unit.
  The costs mainly relate to higher fuel consumption from
vessels sailing faster or taking longer routes to avoid waters
east of  Africa , Kolding said, according to the newswire.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
