Television sales increased by 15
percent worldwide in the fourth quarter as manufacturers led by
Samsung Electronics Co. slashed prices on new technologies to
draw holiday shoppers.  Samsung, based in Suwon, South Korea, led with 21 percent
of the market, researcher DisplaySearch said today in a
statement. Tokyo-based  Sony Corp . was second and  LG Electronics
Inc ., based in Seoul, was third.  Brands and retailers did a better job of anticipating
demand, DisplaySearch said. Energy-efficient light-emitting
diode sets accounted for 30 percent of shipments after prices
fell. 3-D capable sets, which have struggled to attract buyers,
made up about 9 percent of industry revenue.  For all of 2010, Samsung captured 22 percent of TV sales,
followed by LG with 14 percent, Sony with 12 percent, Panasonic
with 8.2 percent and Sharp with 7.1 percent.  In North America, where manufacturers said a price war
crimped profits, Samsung captured 28 percent of revenue, versus
Sony’s 14 percent and Irvine, California-based Vizio Inc.’s 13
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
