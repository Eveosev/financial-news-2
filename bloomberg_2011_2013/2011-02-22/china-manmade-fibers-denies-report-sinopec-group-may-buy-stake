  China Manmade Fibers Corp . denied a
report that China Petrochemical Corp., known as Sinopec Group,
may buy a stake in the Taiwan-based chemical maker.  Sinopec plans to acquire a stake in the Taiwanese company
for more than NT$20 a share, the Taipei-based China Times
reported on its website today, without saying where it got the
information.  “We haven’t been in contact,” Wu Hung-yang, a spokesman
at China Manmade Fibers, said by phone from Taipei today. Wu
said he doesn’t have any knowledge of the reported plan.  Huang Wensheng , a Beijing-based spokesman for Sinopec, said he hasn’t
heard about the matter.  China Manmade Fibers climbed 1.7 percent in Taipei trading
to close at NT$17.85, the highest since April 28, 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
