Australians may be evacuated from  Libya  amid escalating protests against leader Muammar Qaddafi’s
regime, Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  said.  Libyan security forces attacked anti-government
demonstrators yesterday as unrest spread across the Middle East
and North Africa. The International Federation for Human Rights
says more than 300 people have been killed.  “Australians have been very shocked at the images they’ve
seen on their TV screens of such widespread violence in Libya
and also deaths,” Gillard told reporters in Canberra today.
“We are starting to canvas evacuation options should that be
necessary.”  Gillard urged an estimated 80 Australians in Libya to leave
if it was safe to do so and for others not to travel there.  To contact the reporter on this story:
