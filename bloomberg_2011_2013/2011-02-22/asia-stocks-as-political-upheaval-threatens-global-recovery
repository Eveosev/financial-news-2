Asian stocks fell, sending the
regional benchmark index to its biggest decline in a month, as
concern mounted that instability in the Middle East and North
Africa may derail a global recovery.  Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co., which gets 38
percent of sales from the Middle East, slumped 9.7 percent in
Seoul. Chiyoda Corp., a plant-engineering company that gets
almost half of its income from the Middle East, sank 4.4 percent
in Tokyo.  Air China Ltd . and  Singapore  Airlines Ltd. dropped at
least 2.4 percent as crude oil futures soared to their highest
in more than two years in London, curbing the earnings outlook
for the world’s biggest airlines.  “The big risk for the world is oil prices,”  Arjuna Mahendran , Singapore-based head of investment strategy for  Asia 
at  HSBC Private Bank , said on Bloomberg Television. “If  oil
prices  hit $120 a barrel in the next three months, that’s
effectively a tax on U.S. consumers. That could slow down the
phase of recovery that we’ve seen since last year.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 1.9 percent to 137.13
as of 7:25 p.m. in Tokyo, heading for its worst performance
since Jan. 20. About nine stocks declined for each that advanced
in the measure. The gauge climbed 3 percent last week, the most
since the period ended Dec. 3, as reports showed a U.S. economic
recovery and corporate earnings are improving.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225  Stock Average sank 1.8 percent after
Moody’s Investors Service changed the outlook for the country’s
credit rating to negative from stable on concern the government
won’t do enough to address the nation’s debt burden. China’s
Shanghai Composite Index dropped 2.6 percent, while  Hong Kong ’s
Hang Seng Index decreased 2.1 percent.  New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index slipped 0.7 percent after
Christchurch was hit by a magnitude 6.3 earthquake.  Australia ’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.9 percent.  South Korea ’s Kospi Index
declined 1.8 percent, while Taiwan’s Taiex Index slid 1.9
percent.  Libya Violence  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 1.5
percent today. U.S. markets were shut for a holiday yesterday.  Violence in  Libya  intensified yesterday as the government
attacked protesters and rebels claimed control of the second-
biggest city, Benghazi, after Muammar Qaddafi’s son threatened
“rivers of blood” unless the uprising ends. Oil surged to the
highest price in more than two years in London on concern
turmoil in the region will disrupt supplies.  Asian companies with businesses in the Middle East and
North Africa declined.  Hyundai Engineering slumped 9.7 percent to 72,300 won in
Seoul. Samsung Engineering Co., which won contracts in  Bahrain 
and Saudi Arabia this month, dropped 5.6 percent to 177,500 won
Seoul. Chiyoda, which is building facilities for the Saudi
Arabian Oil Co., slipped 4.3 percent to 721 yen in Tokyo.  ‘Wait and See’    Boustead Singapore Ltd ., the engineering company that’s
helping to build a water-infrastructure project in Libya,
dropped 4.4 percent to 97.5 Singapore cents.  Hyflux Ltd ., a
Singapore-based company that has water-desalination projects in
Algeria and Libya, decreased 7.1 percent to S$1.95. Olam
International Ltd., an agricultural commodities supplier that
counts the Middle East and North Africa among its major markets,
tumbled 9.3 percent to S$2.63 in Singapore.  “There’s uncertainty about what’s going on in the Middle
East,” said Yasushi Noguchi, a strategist in Tokyo at SMBC
Friend Securities Co. “Investors will increasingly be taking a
wait-and-see stance.”  Airline stocks declined after Brent crude for April
settlement on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange
climbed yesterday by $3.22 to $105.74 a barrel, the highest
since Sept. 22, 2008.  Air  China , the world’s biggest airline by market value,
declined 7 percent to HK$7.46 in Hong Kong. Singapore Airlines,
the second-largest, dropped 2.4 percent to S$14. Korean Air
Lines Co. slumped 10 percent to 62,100 won in Seoul, the most in
the MSCI Asia Pacific Index.  Taiwan Airlines  China Airlines Ltd., Taiwan’s largest carrier, slid 4.7
percent to the lowest since Aug. 3. EVA Airways Corp., the No. 2,
sank 6.8 percent, the biggest decline since August. Oil accounts
for at least 40 percent of the airlines’ total cost, said Stone Lin, an analyst at Yuanta Securities Co. by telephone in Taipei.  Among stocks that advanced, BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s
biggest mining company, climbed 1.6 percent to A$46.58 in Sydney.
The company agreed to buy Chesapeake Energy Corp.’s Fayetteville
assets in central  Arkansas  for $4.75 billion in cash, entering
the U.S. shale gas business.  Gold climbed above $1,400 an ounce to the highest price
since Jan. 4 in  London . Silver reached a 30-year high.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index increased 1.5 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 6.8 percent by the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 4.1 percent by the Stoxx Europe
600 Index. Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 14.2
times estimated earnings on average, compared with 14 times for
the S&P 500 and 11.4 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
