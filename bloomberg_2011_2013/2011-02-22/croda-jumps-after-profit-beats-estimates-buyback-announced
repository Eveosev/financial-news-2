  Croda International Plc , a supplier
of ingredients for Nivea sunblock, climbed in London trading
after the company announced a share buyback program and earnings
that beat analyst estimates.  Operating profit advanced to 49.4 million pounds ($80
million) in the fourth quarter from 35 million pounds a year
earlier, the Goole, England-based company said today. Analysts
in a Bloomberg survey had estimated earnings before interest and
tax at 43 million pounds.  Croda stock climbed as much as 5.2 percent as the company
pledged to repurchase about 50 million pounds of shares, as long
as no “suitable” acquisition opportunity arose.  The shares traded up 56 pence at 1,550 pence as of 8:51
a.m., valuing the company at 2.1 billion pounds. The FTSE 250
index declined 1.3 percent on investor fears of growing unrest
in the Middle East and North Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
