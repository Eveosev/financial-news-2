German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
threatened to impose sanctions on Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi 
unless he halts the violent crackdown by his forces on anti-
government demonstrators.  Merkel said that Qaddafi’s televised speech today in which
he threatened his own people with civil war was “alarming,”
she told reporters in Berlin.  “If the use of violence doesn’t stop, Germany will call
for us to use all avenues of pressure and influence on Libya,
including the question of talking about sanctions,” Merkel
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
