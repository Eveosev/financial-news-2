The  European Investment Bank  boosted
its lending for climate-related projects to a record 19 billion
euros ($26 billion) last year and said it was preparing rules on
2012 sales of European Union carbon permits from a reserve to
spur clean-energy projects.  That loan total was an 18.7 percent increase from 16
billion euros in 2009 and represented 30 percent of the EIB’s
entire lending in the 27-nation bloc, according to the bank, the
EU’s lending arm. The EU is leading the global fight against  climate change  and wants to increase the use of renewable energy
and promote low-emission technologies to meet its targets of
cutting  greenhouse gases  by 20 percent in 2020 compared with
1990 levels.  “Environment and energy are the bank’s business priorities
that include the specific climate action projects that we
pursue,” EIB President Philippe Maystadt told a conference in
Brussels today. “While political leaders will negotiate the EU
and international legislation on climate action, our financing
will be critical to help meet the goals.”  The EIB said its lending for  renewable energy  projects in
the EU and accession countries rose by 1.4 billion euros to 5.6
billion euros last year, while loans for energy-efficiency
programs increased to 1.7 billion euros from 1.5 billion euros
in 2009. Nations outside the bloc received 2 billion euros for
climate-related projects in 2010, according to the EIB.  Renewable Energy  The bank next year will help the EU handle sales of 300
million carbon-dioxide permits from a reserve to spur clean-
energy projects. The EIB will monetize the allowances from the
post-2012 reserve for new entrants to the European emissions-
trading system and disburse the revenue via national governments
to aid projects for carbon storage and renewable energy.  The reserve, known as NER300, is valued at 4.6 billion
euros at today’s prices. The EU emissions program, which imposes
pollution limits on around 11,000 manufacturing and energy
companies, started in 2005, is now in its second trading period
through 2012 and will enter the third starting in 2013.  The first 200 million allowances will be sold before the
winning projects are selected in the second half of 2012 and the
sale of the remaining 100 million is expected to be completed
before 2013, the  European Commission  has said. It signaled last
year that sales are unlikely to start in 2011 because the EU’s
single registry for its emissions-trading system, necessary to
sell Phase 3 permits, won’t be ready this year.  Regular Intervals  “The EIB will begin sale of the allowances one month after
they have been transferred to the bank and made available for
settlement,” according to a statement on its website. “Sales
will take place in regular intervals and at least every second
week. The allowances shall be sold for settlement in December
2013 at the earliest, meaning all sales will be of a forward
nature.”  The EIB has yet to decide whether it can sell the
allowances through auctions, on an exchange or in over-the-
counter transactions. It will aim to minimize any impact on the
secondary market, the EU said last year.  The EU and the EIB may struggle to be ready to sell the
entire 300 million allowances by the end of 2012 without hurting
carbon prices, said  Trevor Sikorski , an analyst at Barclays
Capital investment bank in  London . “Given the history of
delays, there are big questions,” including whether the new EU
registry that will track allowances will be ready before the
second half of 2012, Sikorski said today in a telephone
interview.  To contact the reporters on this story:
