Trading on the Italian exchange
remained halted because of “technical issues” after the
benchmark  FTSE MIB Index  fell the most in eight months yesterday
on concern Libya’s unrest may affect Italian companies.  Borsa Italiana SpA, owned by  London Stock Exchange Group
Plc , said in a  statement  on its website that “restoring
operations” are under way after stocks failed to open and the
futures market was halted at 12:10 p.m. All markets are
suspended, the Milan bourse said in a separate statement.  The trading suspension “is something unacceptable,” said
Francesco Vercesi, a money manager at Fiduciaria Orefici Sim SpA
in Milan. Investors were permitted to cancel orders submitted
before the scheduled opening, the exchange said. Futures trading
on the FTSE MIB was temporarily halted Jan. 3 because of
technical “issues.”  The FTSE MIB yesterday lost 3.6 percent to 22,230.2, the
biggest decline since June 29.  Impregilo SpA , the country’s
largest construction company, plummeted 6.2 percent to 2.31
euros, the biggest loss since April 2009. The company has 1
billion euros ($1.4 billion) of projects in Libya, according to
Milan broker Equita Sim SpA.  UniCredit SpA , the nation’s biggest
bank, sank 5.8 percent to 1.87 euros, the largest loss since
May.  UniCredit was down 2.1 percent to 1.83 euros at 12:44 p.m.
local time on Chi-X Europe Ltd., Europe’s largest alternative
trading system. Eni, Europe’s fourth-biggest oil company, was
down 2 percent to 17.09 euros. Impregilo was down 6.3 percent to
2.16 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
