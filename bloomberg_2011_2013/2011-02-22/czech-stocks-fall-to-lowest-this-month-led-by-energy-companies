The Czech Republic’s main stock
index fell for the first time in three days and the koruna slid
to its weakest versus the euro in six weeks as violence
escalated in Libya.  The PX gauge of 15 companies ended the day down 0.1 percent
at 1,241.4 at 4:28 p.m. after earlier sliding as much as 1.3
percent.  CEZ AS , the Czech power utility with a 24 percent
weighting in the index, fell 1.1 percent to 818 koruna.  Protests in the Middle East are driving  oil prices  higher,
stoking concern inflation will quicken. At least 250 people died
in the Libyan capital Tripoli overnight as violence spread in
the nation with Africa’s largest oil reserves, al-Jazeera
reported. Equities tumbled worldwide today.  “Financial markets are under the influence of the bloody
clashes in Libya,” Pavel Mertlik, Prague-based chief economist
at Raiffeisenbank AS, wrote in a report today. “We expected the
impulse for koruna weakening to come from peripheral euro-area
economies rather than from the southern Mediterranean coast.”  The koruna depreciated as much as 0.3 percent to 24.537 per
euro, its weakest intraday level since Jan. 11, and traded down
0.2 percent at 24.500 per euro as of 5:10 p.m. in Prague.    Unipetrol AS , the biggest Czech oil refiner, retreated 1.1
percent to 178 koruna, its lowest close since Feb. 11.  Komercni
Banka AS , the Czech unit of Societe Generale SA, declined 1.1
percent to 4,145 koruna, its lowest end-of-day price since Nov.
30. Coal producer  New World Resources NV  tumbled 1.1 percent to
266.1 koruna, snapping two days of gains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
