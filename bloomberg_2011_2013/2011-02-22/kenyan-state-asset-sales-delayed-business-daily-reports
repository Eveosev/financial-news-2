     Feb. 22 (Bloomberg) ---  Kenya ’s sale of state-owned assets
is being held up after the contracts of seven officials at the
Privatization Commission expired last month and they weren’t
replaced, Business Daily reported on its website.  The board of the commission hasn’t met since November,
holding up plans to sell assets worth about 8 billion shillings
($97.6 million), the Nairobi-based newspaper reported today,
citing board member Peter Kimuyu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
