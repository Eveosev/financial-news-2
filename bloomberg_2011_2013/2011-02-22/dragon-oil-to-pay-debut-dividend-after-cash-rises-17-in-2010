  Dragon Oil Plc , the London-listed
energy explorer focused on  Turkmenistan , will pay a debut
dividend after its cash balance rose 17 percent last year.  The company’s board agreed to pay a full-year dividend of
14 cents a share, Dragon said today in a statement. Its cash
balance rose to $1.3 billion. Net income increased 49 percent to
$386.1 million in 2010.  “We will continue to maintain the current level of
dividends,” Chief Executive Officer Abdul-Jaleel al-Khalifa
said in a phone interview. “But we want to maintain
flexibility” depending on acquisitions and  cash flow .  Dragon, which plans to increase oil output by 10 percent to
15 percent a year through 2013, may acquire some assets or
companies this year to expand its operations in the Middle East,
Central Asia, North and West Africa, al-Khalifa said today. The
company plans to invest as much at $700 million in oil
infrastructure through 2013, including $250 million this year,
it said today.  The Middle East and North African unrest hasn’t
“impacted” the company plans, al Khalifa said. “Our area of
interest includes the countries that are stable and
perspective.”  Dragon rose 3.3 percent to 577 pence in  London . The shares
added about 25 percent in the last year.  Production Rises  Average production climbed 5.5 percent to 47,211 barrels of
oil a day last year, with daily output reaching 57,013 barrels
at the end of 2010, the company said in a January statement. The
explorer raised oil and condensate reserves to 639 million
barrels and booked 1.6 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves.  “Dragon Oil enjoyed a record year in terms of revenues
generated and the number of wells drilled,” al Khalifa said in
the statement. “We have a strong platform to deliver on the
upper end of our production forecast this year.”  It plans to drill at least 11 development wells this year.  The company may exit its Yemen operations, al Khalifa said.
“The upside and the potential of these assets isn’t high,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
