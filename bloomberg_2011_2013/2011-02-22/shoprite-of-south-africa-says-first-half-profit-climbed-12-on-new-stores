  Shoprite Holdings Ltd ., Africa’s
largest food retailer, said profit climbed 12 percent in the
fiscal first half as  consumer spending  recovered and it opened
new stores  Net income advanced to 1.2 billion rand ($167 million), or
2.34 rand a share, in the six months ended Dec. 31, from 1
billion rand, or 2.08 rand, a year earlier, the Cape Town-based
company said today in a stock-exchange statement. Sales gained
9.4 percent to 36.3 billion rand.  Shoprite, which has supermarkets in 15 countries outside of
South Africa, has opened stores and added jobs to take advantage
of a recovery in spending. South Africa, the biggest economy on
the continent, added 157,000 jobs in the fourth quarter, helping
to reduce the  unemployment rate  for the first time in a year, to
24 percent, the national statistics office said on Feb. 8.  “We continued our strategy of substantial investment in
infrastructure for future growth,” Chief Executive Officer
Whitey Basson said in an e-mailed statement. In the second half
of the year “we should be able to maintain the level of
profitability achieved in the first half.”  The retailer opened 41 new supermarkets in the first half
and added 2,000 jobs since December 2009, boosting staff costs
by 15 percent to 2.9 billion rand.  Retail sales in the country surged an annual 8.3 percent in
December, the fastest pace in more than three years, Pretoria-
based Statistics  South Africa  said Feb. 16. Spar Group Ltd., a
Durban-based food retailer, said on Feb. 14 that revenue climbed
9.5 percent in the quarter through Dec. 25.  The retailer may benefit from rising prices in the second
half. Inflation accelerated to a six-month high of 3.7 percent
in January as gasoline and food costs climbed, the statistics
office said on Feb. 16.  “Food inflation will rise, as it has been doing since the
start of 2011, as a weakening rand increasingly exposes local
consumers to the high food prices already evident on overseas
markets,” Basson said.  Shoprite shares fell 64 cents, or 0.7 percent, to 95.86
rand of of 9:01 a.m. in Johannesburg, giving the company a
market value of 52.1 billion rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
