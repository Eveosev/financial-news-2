  Kerry Group Plc , Ireland’s largest
food company, said earnings may rise by as much as 12 percent
this year, as it considers more acquisitions.  Kerry forecasts adjusted earnings per share of 210 euro
cents to 218 cents, compared with 194.5 cents in 2010, the
Tralee, Ireland-based company said today in a statement.  Net income rose to 324.2 million euros ($440 million) for
the year ended Dec. 31 from 201.2 million euros a year earlier.
Sales rose 9.7 percent to 4.96 billion euros, compared with the
4.52 billion euros in the previous year.  “Very good” momentum in volume growth from the fourth
quarter is expected to continue into the first half of this
year, Kerry’s Chief Financial Officer Brian Mehigan said in a
phone interview. Kerry, the world’s largest ingredients and
flavors’ company, has capacity to spend between several hundred
million euros and 1 billion euros on acquisitions, he said.  “We would be running the rule over many of our
competitors, which can be small, medium-sized or even large
companies,” said Mehigan. “We would expect to execute on that
pipeline during 2011.”  Kerry climbed 1 percent to 25.65 euros as of 8:32 a.m. in
Dublin. The stock has risen 2.9 percent this year, giving the
company a market value of 4.5 billion euros.  The company plans to pay a final dividend of 20 cents per
share, giving a total of 28.8 cents for the full year, an
increase of 15 percent on the prior year’s payout.  Like-for-like sales at Kerry’s ingredients and flavors
business rose 6.6 percent to 3.7 billion euros, while sales from
its consumer foods business rose 1.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
