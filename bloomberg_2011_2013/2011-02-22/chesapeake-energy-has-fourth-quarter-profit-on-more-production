  Chesapeake Energy Corp ., the
natural-gas producer that has agreed to sell $7.65 billion in
assets in the last five months, posted a fourth-quarter profit
as it ramped up its oil production.  Net income was $180 million, or 28 cents a share, Oklahoma
City-based Chesapeake said today in a statement on  Business
Wire . The company reported a net loss of $524 million, or 84
cents a share, for the same quarter in 2009, according to a
filing.  Excluding unusual gains and losses, Chesapeake earned 70
cents per share, 6 cents more than the average of 30 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  The results “look solid,”  Scott Hanold , an analyst with  RBC Capital Markets  in  Minneapolis ,  Minnesota , wrote in a note.
Hanold rates Chesapeake’s shares “sector perform” and owns
none.  Chesapeake said oil production increased to 5.5 million
barrels in the fourth quarter, from 2.7 million in the same
quarter of 2009. Oil and natural-gas liquids made up 12 percent
of production during the quarter, compared with 7 percent in the
same quarter of 2009.  Chesapeake said it plans to increase its oil production to
150,000 barrels a day, or 20 to 25 percent of its total, to take
advantage of the price gap between oil and gas. The benchmark
gas price in  New York  fell 21 percent to $4.41 in 2010. Crude
oil was trading at 24 times the price of gas on Tuesday, the
highest ratio since 1992, according to a Bloomberg calculation.  Asset Sales  Natural-gas production increased to 235 billion cubic feet
in the fourth quarter of 2010, higher than the same quarter in
2009.  On Oct. 4, Chesapeake agreed to sell $1.25 billion of its
future production in the Barnett Shale gas field to an affiliate
of Barclays Plc. On Oct. 11, Chesapeake sold a one-third share
in its Eagle Ford Shale operations to Cnooc Ltd., for $1.08
billion.  In January, Chesapeake sold a one-third share of its
Niobrara Shale operations to Cnooc for $570 million.  Yesterday, the company announced it was selling its entire
487,000-acre operation in  Arkansas ’s Fayetteville Shale to BHP
Billiton Ltd. for $4.75 billion.  On Jan. 6, CEO Aubrey McClendon said Chesapeake would cut
its debt by 25 percent over two years, while increasing
production by 25 percent.  Chesapeake’s shares have two sell, 13 buy and 19 hold
recommendations from analysts.  Chesapeake released its earnings after regular trading on
the New York Stock Exchange closed. The shares fell 47 cents to
$31.54 in after hours trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
