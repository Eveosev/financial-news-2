Muhammad bin Sayyid Hassan as-
Senussi , who would be Libya’s crown prince if the country still
had a monarchy, said the people who were “killed by the brutal
forces” of President  Muammar Qaddafi  are “heroes” and that
their struggle will soon be victorious.  Qadaffi’s “fight to stay in power will not last long,
because of the desire for freedom by the Libyan people,”
Senussi, whose great-uncle King Idris was overthrown by Qaddafi
in 1969, said in an e-mailed statement from  London  today. He
called upon the international community “to halt all support
for the dictator with immediate effect.”  Qaddafi’s crackdown on a week-long uprising, inspired by
protests that overthrew the leaders of Tunisia and  Egypt , has
left more than 200 dead as regime supporters fired on
demonstrators in Tripoli, according to  Human Rights Watch .
Libya’s royal family, which was for a period held under house
arrest by Qaddafi, emigrated to the U.K. in 1988, according to
the statement.  “I send my condolences for the heroes who have laid down
their lives, killed by the brutal forces of Qaddafi,” the 48-
year-old Senussi said. “The Libyan people have now chosen to
challenge this regime peacefully until it is gone from  Libya ,
and the people will not return to their homes until justice is
delivered.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
