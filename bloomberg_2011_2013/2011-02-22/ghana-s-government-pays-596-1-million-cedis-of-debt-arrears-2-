  Ghana  settled 596.1 million cedis
($395.7 million) of unpaid bills owed to road contractors,
health and education funds, Finance Ministry spokeswoman Cecilia
Akwetey said.  Part of the money for the payments came from 401.2 million
cedis raised from a Feb. 16 auction of three-year bonds, she
said in a phone interview today from Accra, the capital.  Non-performing loans in the banking industry linked to
government arrears have hampered credit growth in the West
African nation, said  Razia Khan , a London-based economist with
Standard Chartered Plc.  “To the extent that the payment of arrears improves this
situation, then we might expect that credit growth picks up
again--gradually,” Khan said in an e-mailed response to
questions today. “Nonetheless, even a gradual rise in credit
growth could be something of a game-changer.”  Ghana reduced the debt of the state-owned Tema Oil
Refinery Ltd. by 21 percent to 1.25 billion cedis last year
through the sale of three-year bonds in March, Fifi Kwetey,
deputy minister of finance and economic planning, said Feb. 3.  This year’s settling of accounts may help employment in the
construction industry, boosting hiring of unskilled workers and
“will enhance the pace of economic activity,” Sampson Akligoh,
an Accra-based analyst with Databank Financial Services Ltd.,
said in an e-mail today.  The payment will have a “minimal” effect in lowering
lending rates in the West African nation, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
