  Portugal ’s PSI-20 Index gained
13.82, or 0.2 percent, to 7,869.55 at the 4:30 p.m. close in
Lisbon, its first gain in three days.  The following are among the most active stocks in the
Portuguese market today.    Altri SGPS SA  (ALTR PL), Portugal’s second-biggest pulp-
and-paper company, gained 4.3 percent to 1.73 euros. The company
started its two-for-one stock split today.  Galp SGPS SA (GALP PL), Portugal’s biggest oil company,
rose 1.7 percent to 15.18 euros. Oil surged to the highest level
in more than two years as intensifying violence in Libya fuelled
concern that supplies from the holder of Africa’s largest crude
reserves may be disrupted.  Inapa-Investimentos Participacoes e Gestao SA (INA PL)
dropped 1.1 percent to 36.1 euro cents. Portugal’s biggest paper
distributor will be replaced on the country’s benchmark  PSI-20
index  by bank Banif SGPS SA from March 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
