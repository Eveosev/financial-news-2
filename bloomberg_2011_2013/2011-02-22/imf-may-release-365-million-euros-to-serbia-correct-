(Corrects currency in first paragraph.)  The  International Monetary Fund  may
release 365 million euros from Serbia’s bailout after the
completion of the final review of the country’s progress under
the loan agreement and approval by the lender’s board at the end
of next month, the IMF said in a statement today.  The country’s 2010 current-account deficit of 7 percent of
gross domestic product was better than expected, according to
the Washington-based lender.  The government plans to submit a bill on the refinancing of
corporate debt to lawmakers by the end of February to meet a
requirement of the board approval, Serbian Finance Minister  Diana Dragutinovic  said at a press conference in Belgrade today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
