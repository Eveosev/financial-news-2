Deliveries of general aviation
airplanes, not including military aircraft or commercial jets,
declined 11.4 percent last year, as traditional private
customers struggled to obtain credit and shipments have yet to
catch up to the economic recovery, the General Aviation
Manufacturers Association said today.  The number of airplanes delivered fell for a third
consecutive year, dropping to 2,015 from 2,274 airplanes the
year before, the association said in a statement. The
association represents more than 65 worldwide manufacturers of
airplanes, engines and related equipment.  Industry billings increased to $19.7 billion from $19.5
billion the year before. Last year was the “third best year
ever” for total industry billings due to deliveries of long-
range, large-cabin aircraft, the association said.  “Our industry experienced another challenging year that
required many manufacturers to continue to make careful
decisions about production schedules, employment and product
development,” John Rosanvallon, the association’s chairman and
president and chief executive officer of  Dassault Aviation SA ’s
Dassault Falcon, said in a statement. “Despite the pain caused
by the downturn, we are now seeing strong GDP growth on a global
level and corporate profits are up. This bodes well for general
aviation’s future.”  Shipments of turboprop airplanes declined the most, by 17.7
percent to 363 planes in 2010, from 441 the year before.
Shipments of piston-engine airplanes fell 7.7 percent to 889
from 963 in 2009. Business jet deliveries dropped to 763 in 2010
from 870 in 2009, a 12.3 percent decline.  -- Editors: Steven Komarow, Bob Drummond  To contact the reporter on this story:
