Yemen’s naval forces seized an
Iranian vessel with 13 crew members on board yesterday morning
after it entered Yemeni waters, the  Ministry of Defense  said.  Yemen’s patrolling forces seized the Iranian ship “after
it went into Yemen waters near Socotra,” an island in the  Indian Ocean , the Sana’a-based ministry said in a statement on
its website. The vessel was taken to the island and the crew
members put up no resistance, it said.  The crew members are being interrogated, an unidentified
security official said, according to the ministry. No
information was given regarding the vessel’s route or its load.  To contact the reporters on this story:
