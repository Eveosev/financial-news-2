Kosovo’s lawmakers voted to keep
Hashim Thaci as prime minister,  RTK  reported today. The
broadcaster earlier said that parliament elected Swiss-based
businessman Behgjet Pacolli as the country’s new president.  Thaci and Kosovo-born Pacolli, who heads construction
company  Mabetex Group , formed a coalition between their
political parties and agreed to split the two top posts between
them, RTK said. Opposition deputies walked out in protest.  Kosovo declared independence from  Serbia  in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
