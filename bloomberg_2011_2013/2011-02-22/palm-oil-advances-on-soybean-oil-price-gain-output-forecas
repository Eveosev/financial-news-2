  Palm oil  gained for the first time
in six days as prices of soybeans and crude oil rallied, while
ECM Libra Capital Sdn. forecast an increase in production.  The May-delivery contract rose 0.4 percent to close at
3,669 ringgit ($1,203) a metric ton on the  Malaysia  Derivatives
Exchange. Futures earlier fluctuated, increasing as much as 1.3
percent and dropping as much as 0.5 percent.  Soybeans gained after dropping for two straight weeks on
rising demand for U.S. crops to feed livestock, produce fuel and
supply export markets. Crude advanced to the highest level in
more than two years as violence escalated in Libya, stoking
concern that oil supplies may disrupted. Palm and soybean oils
are substitutes in food and fuel uses, and shifts in crude costs
can influence their prices.  Soybean prices “cannot fall over long periods of time,”
said Arhnue Tan, an analyst at ECM Libra. “At some point,
people will want to come in and make a punt on it.” “Crude may
have a tendency to affect other commodities in the short term.”    Libya  is the eighth-largest oil producer among those with
quotas in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and
has Africa’s largest crude reserves.  Palm oil has rallied 39 percent in the past year as a La
Nina weather event brought heavy rain to Indonesia and Malaysia,
the top producers, depleting stockpiles as output dropped amid
rising global demand for cooking oils. Futures climbed to a 35-
month high of 3,967 ringgit on Feb. 10.  Palm oil output may recover this year as effects of the La
Nina event taper off, Bernard Ching, an analyst with ECM Libra,
wrote in a report today. The brokerage downgraded the Malaysian
plantation sector to “neutral” from “overweight.”  ‘Water-Loving Plant’  “Most La Nina spikes are typically followed by a spike in
production,” he said. “The palm tree is a water-loving plant
and a La Nina, with its heavy rain, would leave estates with
favorable moisture content in the soil.”  Crude palm oil may average 2,700 ringgit this year, Ching
said. “While 2,700 ringgit average may sound drastic to many
given last week’s close of 3,628 ringgit, we view it as still
reasonable as crude palm oil prices are inherently volatile.”  May-delivery soybeans gained as much as 1.2 percent to
$13.975 per bushel in  Chicago  and traded at $13.885 at 6:10 p.m.  Singapore  time. Soybean oil rose as much as 2.5 percent to 58.56
cents per pound and traded at 57.70 cents at 6:10 p.m.  September-delivery palm oil on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange  gained 0.9 percent to close at 9,732 yuan ($1,480) a
ton. Soybean oil for delivery in the same month rose 1 percent
to 10,464 yuan a ton at the close.  CME Group Inc.’s most-active June palm-oil contract, pegged
to the Malaysian benchmark price, lost 3.3 percent to $1,192.50
at 4:59 p.m. in Singapore.  To contact the reporter on this story:
