Oil options volatility climbed as
the underlying futures surged more than $5 a barrel after
intensifying violence in  Libya  fueled concern that supplies from
the holder of  Africa â€™s largest crude reserves will be disrupted.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 35.7 percent as of 4 p.m. in  New York , up
from 27.9 percent Feb. 18.  Oil for April delivery jumped $5.71, or 6.4 percent, to
$95.42 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The front-
month March contract rose $7.37, or 8.6 percent, to expire at
$93.57, the highest settlement since Oct. 3, 2008.  April $110 calls were the most active options in electronic
trading today, with 5,099 lots changing hands. They gained 51
cents to 67 cents a barrel. April $100 calls, the next-most
active contract, increased $1.30 to $1.74 a barrel with 4,138
contracts trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of oil.  March options expired Feb. 16.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  May $83 puts were the most active options traded Feb. 18,
with 8,226 lots changing hands. They dropped 21 cents to $1 a
barrel. The next-most active option, May $90 puts, decreased 50
cents to $2.95 a barrel on 6,470 contracts.  Open interest was highest for April $100 calls with 43,669
