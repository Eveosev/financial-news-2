  Morgan Sindall Group Plc , a U.K.
based construction and regeneration company, said profit fell
9.4 percent last year on one-time charges and lower revenue that
resulted from government spending cuts.  Net income dropped to 29.9 million pounds ($48.3 million),
or 69.1 pence a share, from 33 million pounds, or 77.1 pence, in
2009, the London-based company said in a statement today.
Revenue fell 5 percent to 2.1 billion pounds.  “We think the private sector is going to pick up some of
the slack” from the spending cuts, Chairman John Morgan said in
a telephone interview. “It is doing a little better than
expected, there is a little more confidence in the economy.”  Morgan Sindall expects the construction market to weaken
for the next three years as the U.K. government cuts spending
plans to deal with a record budget deficit caused by the biggest
recession since World War II. Profit margins will come under
pressure in 2011 as “too many” companies compete for less
business, Morgan said.  The company’s order book at the start of the year rose 13
percent to 3.6 billion pounds, according to the statement.  Morgan Sindall bought Connaught Plc’s maintenance business
out of administration last year and has since made 800 workers
redundant, he said. The acquisition was “transformational” for
the company’s Lovell unit, Morgan said.  The fitting-out business would “go back” this year
because of a shortage of new offices being completed, he said.  The shares fell 1 penny to 715 pence at 8:28 a.m. in London
trading. The stock has risen 30 percent in the past six months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
