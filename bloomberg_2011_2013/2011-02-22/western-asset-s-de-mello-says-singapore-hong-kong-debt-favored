Rajeev De Mello, the head of Asian
investment at Western Asset Management Co., comments on
emerging-market debt and oil prices amid the political
instability in the Middle East.  “The main concern is really over oil security. Asia this
time is sensitive to the oil price and most of the oil is
imported. And  Asia  is right in the process of tightening to
fight higher inflation. That is a bit of a concern.  “The higher oil price is definitely an attack on Asian
growth. For countries which depend significantly on oil imports
that is a challenge and will cost them in terms of both growth
and policy flexibility.  “I think it’s still too early to tell whether there’s
really a threat to oil prices. People are pricing in the greater
risk. If this lasts only a few days, it will not have any impact.  “Some investors are a bit more risk averse, wait and see.
The negative side is the higher oil prices mean inflation. The
positive side is the fact that equities are falling so investors
rebalance. They shift to bonds, especially the local investors.
That’s why we’re seeing a lot of the swap rates come down this
morning and U.S. Treasuries go up because people shift from
equities to the less-risky assets, which are bonds.  “Asia is still viewed pretty much as a safe haven from a
number of other regions. We’ve seen rallies in a number of Asian
long-end bonds like  Singapore ,  Hong Kong .  “I think the longer end of the bond curve will generally
do OK. The defensive ones, Hong Kong and Singapore, will do
well.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
