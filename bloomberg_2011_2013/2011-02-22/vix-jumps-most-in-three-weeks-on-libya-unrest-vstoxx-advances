Investors bid up the price of
options insurance against losses in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index by the most since May amid escalating violence in protests
against Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi .  The VIX, as the  Chicago  Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, rose 27 percent to a 12-week high of 20.80. The  S&P 500 , the benchmark measure of U.S. stocks, dropped 2.1
percent for the biggest slump since August. Oil futures surged
to the highest level in more than two years, jumping 8.6 percent
from the Feb. 18 close to $93.57 a barrel in  New York .  Options prices had declined after the S&P 500’s 31 percent
surge between July 2 and Feb. 18 helped sap demand for
protection from losses. The rally occurred as price swings
narrowed, also driving down options. When the VIX dropped to
15.45 in December, it sank to a level last seen in July 2007, a
month before BNP Paribas SA barred withdrawals from funds that
owned subprime loans and intensified the financial crisis.  “People definitely panicked a bit,” said Jeremy Wien, head
of VIX options trading at Peak6 Capital Management LLC in
Chicago. “There’s a little  risk premium  in the market right now.
I don’t think that’s unwarranted. We’re toward the top of what I
think is the reasonable range. VIX in the 16-to-21 range makes
sense.”  The S&P 500 surged 28 percent between July 2 and Feb. 17
and an options-market indicator known as 30-day realized
volatility fell below 10 on Feb. 15, a combination last seen in
1971, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Price swings are
a key driver of options prices.  ‘Last Drop of Blood’  Qaddafi vowed to fight a growing rebellion until his “last
drop of blood,” pledged to deploy the army and police tomorrow
to impose order, and called on supporters to reclaim the
streets. Continued protests “will lead to civil war,” he said.  Libya  is the holder of  Africa ’s largest oil reserves.  The most-traded VIX options were April 30 calls, which have
a strike price 44 percent higher than the index’s closing level
today. More than 49,400 of the contracts changed hands, while
27,772 of the March 35 calls traded. Their prices surged 60
percent and 75 percent, respectively.  To contact the reporters on this story:
