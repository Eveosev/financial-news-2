  Universal Health Services Inc ., the
operator of more than 100 U.S. medical facilities, is seeking to
refinance $3.45 billion in loans it placed in November,
according to a person with knowledge of the negotiations.  The company will host a lender call today at 2 p.m. New
York time, said the person who declined to be identified because
the talks are private.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. is leading the transaction, the person
said, which will reprice the companyâ€™s $1.6 billion, 6-year term
loan B, a $1.05 billion, 5-year term loan A, and an $800 million
revolving  credit line  that matures in five years, said the
person.  To contact the reporter on this story:
