Soybean-oil exports jumped to a
record in the October-January period as shipments of rival  palm
oil  decreased, Oil World said.  Global soy-oil exports rose 38 percent from a year earlier
to 3.36 million metric tons in the four months ended Jan. 31,
the researcher estimated in a report today. The three largest
shippers exported 2.73 million tons, 44 percent more than the
prior year, it said.  Iran  bought 333,000 tons, up more than 23-
fold from the year-earlier 14,000 tons, and  China ’s purchases
gained 28 percent, Oil World said.  Exports from  Argentina ,  Brazil  and the U.S. rose 22 percent
to 553,000 tons in January, the report showed. Shipments to the
European Union almost tripled to 22,000 tons, those to Africa
more than doubled to 181,000 tons and exports to North and South
American countries rose 50 percent to 132,000 tons, Oil World
said.  “The major reasons for this increase are to be seen in the
shortfall of world exports of palm oil caused by insufficient
production in  Malaysia , Indonesia and Colombia and higher soya-
oil import requirements in several countries,” the researcher
said. “Soy-oil exports to Iran exceeded our expectations.”  Soy-oil futures gained 47 percent in the past year on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Prices surged on Feb. 10 to the highest
level since July 2008 on stronger demand.  Rapeseed, or canola, purchases will fall 15 percent in the
second half of the marketing year from the first half because of
a lack of exportable supplies as EU countries increase imports,
Oil World said.  World imports of rapeseed from January through June will
total 4.9 million tons, down from 5.8 million tons in the prior
six months, the researcher said. EU nations will buy 2.5 million
tons in the marketing year through June, 15 percent above a
previous estimate and more than the year-earlier 2.18 million
tons, Oil World said.  Rapeseed futures jumped 51 percent in the past year on ICE
Futures Canada.  To contact the reporter on this story:
