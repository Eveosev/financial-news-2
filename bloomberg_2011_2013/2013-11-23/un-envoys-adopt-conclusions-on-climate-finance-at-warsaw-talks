Envoys at United Nations global
warming talks adopted a decision on climate change aid, clearing
up a second of three areas that’s kept them working a day over
time in Warsaw.  The text calls on developed countries to mobilize climate
aid from government money “at increasing levels” from the $10-billion a year paid out from 2010 through 2012, with an aim to
reach their pledge of $100 billion in 2020 from public and
private funds.  Delegates have also agreed on a work plan leading through
to a planned globally-binding climate agreement in 2015. They’ve
yet to decide whether to create a mechanism that will help
vulnerable nations deal with the losses and damage caused  by
global warming.  To contact the reporter on this story:
