“The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,”
the film sequel starring Jennifer Lawrence as heroine Katniss
Everdeen, had sales of $70.5 million in its first two days at
U.S. and Canadian theaters, and is on track to set a record for
the best November debut.  The movie, from  Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF) , also stars
Josh Hutcherson as Everdeen’s co-combatant, Peeta Mellark. The
film opened in theaters worldwide yesterday, and is forecast to
take in $166 million domestically this weekend, according to
BoxOffice.com.  Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Rentrak,
forecasts $150 million or more, which would make it the best
three-day opening for November. The record is held by the $142.8
million in sales “The Twilight Saga: New Moon” had in November
2009.  The original “Hunger Games” collected $152.5 million in
receipts in its March 2012 premiere.  Only “Marvel’s The Avengers,” “Iron Man 3” and “Harry
Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,” the current No. 3 at
$169.2 million, have brought in more on their opening weekends
at U.S. and Canadian cinemas.  Lions Gate’s figure of $70.5 million included Thursday
night showings. The studio declined to break out Friday’s
results. The movie grossed $25.3 million in early screenings on
Nov. 21, the company said.  “Catching Fire,” based on the Suzanne Collins novel,
garnered an 89 percent favorable rating on  RottenTomatoes.com ,
which aggregates critics’ reviews. The film picks up where “The
Hunger Games” left off, with Everdeen and Mellark touring the
fictional nation of Panem after winning the 74th Hunger Games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
