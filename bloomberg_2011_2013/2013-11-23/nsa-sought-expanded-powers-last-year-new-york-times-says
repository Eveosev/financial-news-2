Officials at the U.S. National
Security Agency pushed to expand its powers last year, the  New
York  Times reported, citing a document it said was provided by
former security contractor Edward Snowden.  Agency officials set an objective to “aggressively pursue
legal authorities,” the newspaper said in a report published
today. The five-page NSA document said existing U.S. laws
weren’t adequate to meet the agency’s needs to conduct broad
surveillance, according to the Times.  The document was written before Snowden, beginning in June,
exposed programs the NSA uses to collect e-mail and telephone
records of millions of Americans, sparking debate about the
agency’s reach. Snowden remains in  Russia  under temporary
asylum.  Vanee Vines, a spokeswoman for the NSA, in an e-mail today
said the document procured by the Times “is designed to guide
investments in future capabilities and close gaps in current
capabilities.”  “We also build compliance into our systems and tools to
ensure that the workforce operates within the law,” Vines said.
“NSA tries to get in front of issues to better fulfill the
foreign-intelligence requirements of the U.S. government.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
