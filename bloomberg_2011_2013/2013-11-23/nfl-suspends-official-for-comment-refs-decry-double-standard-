The National Football League
suspended official Roy Ellison one game for a “profane and
derogatory” comment during a game to Washington Redskins
offensive tackle Trent Williams, the NFL said.  “NFL game officials are expected to avoid personal
confrontations with players and be respectful of players and
coaches at all times,” the league said in its statement.  The National Football League Referees Association issued a
statement calling the suspension “arbitrary and unjustified”
and said “the NFL has chosen to ignore the racial slur directed
by Trent Williams at Roy Ellison.”  “The NFL’s decision to suspend Mr. Ellison creates a
double standard for what is acceptable on-field conduct,” NFLRA
Executive Director Jim Quirk said in a release. “The league
insists that officials are held to a ‘high standard,’ but others
involved in the game are held to no standard.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
