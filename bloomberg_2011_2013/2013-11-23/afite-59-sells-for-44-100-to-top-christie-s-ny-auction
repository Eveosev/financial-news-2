A case of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild
1959 fetched $44,100 at a Christie’s International Plc sale in
New York, beating its estimate amid demand for historic wines
even as investors have shunned more recent Bordeaux vintages.  The Lafite ’59 was one of the estate’s top six vintages of
the past 60 years, according to online scores awarded by U.S.
wine critic  Robert Parker , and the price paid by a U.S. private
buyer made it the top lot, beating Burgundies from the 1990s.  The auction on Nov. 15 came as the benchmark Liv-ex Fine
Wine 50 Index gave up gains made in the first 10 weeks of the
year, after investors deterred by prices of recent Bordeaux
vintages sought older wines or alternatives outside the region.
While Bordeaux still dominates wine-fund holdings, Burgundies
have taken an increasing share of top 10 slots at auctions.  “The market has now spent the last seven months giving
back the gains made in the first quarter of the year,” Will Beck, partner at London-based Wine Asset Managers LLP, said in a
market report. The fund has $20 million under management.  A case of La Tache 1995 Domaine de la Romanee-Conti from
the Cote de Nuits area of Burgundy sold for $23,275, while three
bottles of Vosne-Romanee Cros Parantoux 1996 from grower Henri Jayer sold for $20,825, according to results posted online by
Christie’s. Two bottles of Romanee-Conti 1998 DRC sold for
$19,600, as did a 12-bottle case of Bonnes Mares 1999.  Pauillac Estate  Michael Broadbent, founder of the wine department at
Christie’s, described the 1959 Lafite in his 2007 book “Vintage
Wine” as “one of the best-ever Lafites, quite different from
the more delicately fragrant ’53s and keeping well.” Parker, in
a tasting note dating from 1994, when the wine was already 35
years old, described it as having “a super-aromatic bouquet of
flowers, black truffles, cedar, lead pencil and red fruits.”  Lafite, a first-growth estate in Bordeaux’s Pauillac
district, has more than 100 hectares (247 acres) of red-grape
vines.  Cabernet Sauvignon  typically makes up from 80 percent to
95 percent of its wine, with Merlot from 5 percent to 20
percent, and smaller amounts of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot.  The vineyards, owned by Domaines Barons de Rothschild
(Lafite), date back at least to the 17th century and the estate
has been under the control of the Rothschild family since 1868,
when it was bought by Baron James de Rothschild, then head of
its French branch.  A case of Chateau Latour 1982 went for $18,375 at the
Christie’s sale, while 12 bottles of Chateau Mouton-Rothschild
from the same year fetched $14,700 and a case of Lafite ’96 sold
for $12,250, according to the auction house’s online results.  Separately, an inaugural auction by Los Angeles-based
Wally’s Wines and Crush Wine & Spirits at  New York ’s Whitney
Museum of American Art on Nov. 13 sold a total $2.68 million of
wine, including a top lot of 33 bottles of Romanee Conti grand
cru which fetched $132,000, according to an e-mail from Wally’s.  Following is a table of major wine auctions held so far
this year, with the total sold in dollars. Links are to auction
