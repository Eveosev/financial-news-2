The  St. Louis  Cardinals traded third
baseman David Freese and relief pitcher Fernando Salas to the
Los Angeles Angels in exchange for outfielders Peter Bourjos and
Randal Grichuk, both teams said on their websites.  Freese, 30, Most Valuable Player of the 2011  World Series 
as the Cardinals beat the Detroit Tigers, had spent his entire
Major League Baseball career with St. Louis, hitting .286 with
44 home runs and 237 runs batted in over five seasons.  Bourjos, 26, a .251 hitter in four seasons with the Angels,
has made seven errors in more than 2,600 innings in the
outfield. He led the  American League  with 11 triples in 2011.  “We are excited to be adding the outfield defense and
speed that Bourjos provides and Grichuk is a top prospect,”
Cardinals General Manager John Mozeliak said in a team release.
“We wish both David and Fernando the best and thank them for
their contributions -- especially the many memorable moments
they provided during the 2011 championship season.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
