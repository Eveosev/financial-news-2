Chinese-French artist Zhu Dequn’s
untitled oil on canvas diptych sold for HK$70.7 million ($9.1
million) at Christie’s in  Hong Kong  tonight setting a record for
the artist.  The abstract work painted in 1963 carried a pre-sale high
estimate of HK$40 million according to Christie’s live auction
website.  His previous record was set when Zhu’s diptych entitled
“La Foret Blanche II” sold for HK$60 million at Christie’s in
Hong Kong in November 2012, according to Artnet.com.  To contact the reporter on this story:
