Insurers in the three of the largest
states relying on the federal health-care website are set to
help the government bypass technical issues and sign up
customers in health plans, the U.S. said.  People who need coverage in Florida, Texas and  Ohio  will be
able to shop for health plans at websites run by insurance
companies instead of the federal site, healthcare.gov, Julie
Bataille, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services, said today in a  blog post . The program is
intended to test the concept of “direct enrollment,” in which
people sign up with insurers instead of using the government’s
online marketplace that has been beset by flaws.  The federal  website  is intended for customers in 36 states.
Fourteen states and  Washington , D.C., have created their own
online exchanges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
