The pound strengthened for a third
week against the dollar as a report showed U.K. factory orders
climbed to the highest level in almost two decades, spurring
demand for Britain’s currency.  Sterling gained versus 11 of its 16 major counterparts
before a government report next week that analysts said will
confirm the U.K. economy grew at the fastest pace since 2010.
The pound rallied even as  Bank of England  minutes showed
officials said record-low  interest rates  may still be needed
even after the jobless rate falls to 7 percent. U.K. government
bonds declined as demand for fixed-income assets waned.  “We see any dip in the pound as an opportunity to buy,”
said  Lee Hardman , a currency strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in London. “Even though the Bank of England
keeps reinforcing a message that interest rates may not go up as
soon as the  unemployment rate  drops to 7 percent, some in the
market still think it will raise rates before the Fed, the
 European Central Bank  and  Bank of Japan .”  The pound advanced 0.6 percent this week to $1.6208 as of
5:15 p.m. London time yesterday after gaining 1.2 percent during
the previous two weeks. The U.K. currency appreciated 0.2
percent to 83.56 pence per euro after climbing to 83.17 pence
yesterday, the strongest level since Nov. 7.  Sterling has gained 3.1 percent in the past three months,
the best performer after New Zealand’s dollar out of 10
developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro rose 0.3 percent, while the  U.S.
dollar  fell 1.3 percent.  Manufacturing Expands  The Confederation of British Industry’s manufacturing gauge
climbed to 11 in November, the highest since March 1995, from
minus 4 in October, it said on Nov. 21.  Gross domestic product 
rose 0.8 percent after growing 0.7 percent in the previous three
months, according to a Bloomberg survey before the data is
released on Nov. 27.  U.K. policy makers said there were “uncertainties over the
durability” of the recovery, according to minutes of this
month’s meeting released Nov. 20.  “The projections for growth under constant  bank rate 
underlined there could be a case for not raising bank rate
immediately when the 7 percent unemployment threshold was
reached,” the Nov. 6-7 minutes showed.  The benchmark 10-year gilt yield rose five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, this week to 2.79 percent. The 2.25
percent bond due in September 2023 dropped 0.375, or 3.75 pounds
per 1,000-pound face amount, to 95.395.  Gilts lost 3.5 percent this year through Nov. 21, according
to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German bonds dropped 1.3

3.743 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
