Indonesian artist Lee Man Fong’s
painting “Bali Life” sold for HK$35.96 million ($4.7 million)

artist.  The work dated 1962-1964 measuring 1 meter (3.3 feet) by
2.43 meters did not have a pre-sale estimate.  His previous record was set when Lee’s painting sold for
HK$34.3 million at Sotheby’s in Hong Kong in October 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
