German  government bonds  fell as
minutes of the  Federal Reserve ’s October policy meeting showed
the U.S. central bank may taper its $85 billion in monthly asset
purchases “in coming months” if the economy improves.  Ten-year bund yields yesterday closed at an almost two-week
high as an industry report showed business confidence in
Europe’s largest economy increased to the highest level in more
than a year in November, while manufacturing and services output
in the euro area expanded for a fifth month. Fed Bank of St.
Louis President  James Bullard  said on Nov. 20 a cutback in the
central bank’s stimulus program is “on the table” for the
December meeting.  “It’s a U.S. story,” said Lyn Graham-Taylor, a fixed-income strategist at Rabobank International in London. “The
minutes were interpreted as a bit hawkish and these came on the
heels of Bullard’s own hawkish words. The Ifo was quite good,
which has also helped drive the move” in bonds.  Germany ’s  10-year yield  rose four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, this week to 1.75 percent at 5 p.m. London
time yesterday. That’s the  highest close  since Nov. 12. The 2
percent bund due in August 2023 dropped 0.37, or 3.70 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,355) face amount, to 102.245.  U.S. policy makers “generally expected that the data would
prove consistent with the committee’s outlook for ongoing
improvement in labor market conditions and would thus warrant
trimming the pace of purchases in coming months,” according to
the record of the  Federal Open Market Committee ’s Oct. 29-30
gathering, released Nov. 20 in Washington. The Fed next meets on
Dec. 17-18.  Business Climate  The Ifo institute’s business climate index, based on a
survey of 7,000 executives, rose to the highest since April
2012, and a separate gauge showed euro-region manufacturing and
services output, based on a survey of  purchasing managers ,
expanded in November.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Italy’s bonds over
the benchmark German securities narrowed in the week after the
Rome-based Treasury canceled debt auctions planned for Nov. 26
and Dec. 12, citing reduced funding needs.  Italian  10-year yields  were little changed at 4.08 percent,
leaving the spread over similar-maturity German bunds five basis
points narrower at 233 basis points. The yield on 10-year
 Spanish (GSPG10YR)  bonds rose four basis points to 4.10 percent.  Inflation (ECCPEST)  in the euro-region quickened to 0.8 percent this
month, from a four-year low of 0.7 percent in October, the
European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg will say on
Nov. 29, according to the median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg survey. Germany is scheduled to sell 4 billion euros
of 10-year bunds on Nov. 27. The Netherlands and Italy will also
auction debt.  German government bonds handed investors a loss of 1.3
percent this year through Nov. 21, according to Bloomberg World
Bond Indexes. Spain’s returned 11 percent and Italy’s earned 7.3
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
