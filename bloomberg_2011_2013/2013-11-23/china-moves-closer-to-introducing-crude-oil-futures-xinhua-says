China , the world’s biggest energy
consumer, is pushing ahead with plans to introduce crude oil
futures trading as early as possible, the Xinhua News Agency
reported, citing the chairman of the Shanghai Futures Exchange.  The bourse yesterday started the Shanghai International
Energy Exchange, a trading platform for energy derivatives in
the city’s pilot free-trade zone, Xinhua reported yesterday.
This will allow the listing of crude-oil futures, said Yang Maijun, the head of the futures exchange.  The energy exchange is part of the measures being
introduced at the trade zone, a testing ground for free-market
policies that Premier  Li Keqiang  has signaled he may later
implement more broadly in the world’s second-largest economy.
Energy futures would lure foreign investors to trade onshore and
open the domestic futures market further, according to a China
Securities Regulatory Commission  statement  on Sept. 29.  Preparations  to list crude oil futures will be completed
by the end of the year,  Radio Television Hong Kong  reported on
Nov. 21, citing Yang at a conference.  The Shanghai Futures Exchange spent 5 billion  yuan  ($821
million) to set up the exchange, which will be able to operate
regulated derivative markets for crude oil, natural gas and
other petrochemicals, Xinhua reported. It will provide clearing,
delivery, information distribution and technology services, it
said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
