Egypt  downgraded its ties with
 Turkey  to the level of charge d’affaires and decided to expel
its ambassador to Cairo in protest over Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s backing of toppled President Mohamed Mursi.  The Turkish “leadership is persisting in its support of
groups that are seeking to create instability, and in making
comments that insult the will of the Egyptian people,” Foreign
Ministry spokesman Badr Abdel-Ati said in a televised news
conference in Cairo today.  Turkey’s ambassador was now “persona non grata,” Abdel-Ati said.  Erdogan, whose ruling party is rooted in an Islamic
movement ousted by a military-led campaign in 1997, is among the
most forceful critics of the Egyptian army’s July overthrow of
Mursi, Egypt’s first democratically elected civilian leader, and
the deadly crackdown on his Muslim Brotherhood supporters.
Erdogan has called for the release of Mursi, who went on trial
this month on charges of inciting violence against protesters.  The Turkish Foreign Ministry said this month support for
Mursi reflected the country’s backing of legitimate,
democratically elected governments, without discrimination.  To contact the reporter on this story:
