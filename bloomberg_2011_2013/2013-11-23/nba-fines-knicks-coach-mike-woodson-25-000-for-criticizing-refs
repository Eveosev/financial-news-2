New York  Knicks coach Mike Woodson,
whose team has lost four straight games to fall to 3-8 this
season, was fined $25,000 for public criticism of officials.  The fine was announced yesterday by Rod Thorn, the National
Basketball Association’s president of basketball operations, a
day after Woodson said on ESPN Radio that defenders are not
always getting called for fouls when they hit Knicks scoring
leader Carmelo Anthony.  “I think Melo gets hit more than ever,” Woodson said.
“I’m starting to wonder what’s a foul and what’s not a foul.”  The Knicks, who have lost six straight games at home, start
a four-game road trip tonight in  Washington .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
