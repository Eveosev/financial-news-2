Treasuries dropped, pushing 10-year
note yields up for the third week this month, on speculation
minutes of the  Federal Reserve ’s policy meeting indicated the
bank may trim debt purchases by the end of the year.  The  yield difference  between five- and 10-year notes, known
as the yield curve, widened to the most in two years Nov. 21
after a Labor Department report showed jobless claims fell more
than forecast last week. Fed Bank of St. Louis President  James
Bullard  said Nov. 20 a cutback in the bond-purchase program is
“on the table” for policy makers’ December meeting. Treasury
will sell $96 billion in notes next week.  “The market has accepted that tapering is going to be a
reality,” said  Ward McCarthy , chief financial economist in  New
York  at Jefferies LLC, one of 21 primary dealers that trade with
the Fed. “The Fed keeps telling us it’s a data-dependent
decision and December is on the table. One of the consequences
will be a steeper curve.”  The benchmark 10-year yield rose four basis points this
week, or 0.04 percentage point, to 2.74 percent in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The price of the 2.75
percent note maturing in November 2023 was 100 2/32.  Market Holiday  The  bond market  is closed Nov. 28 for the Thanksgiving
holiday, according to the Securities Industry and Financial
Markets Association  website . SIFMA recommended a 2 p.m. close on
Nov. 29.  Treasuries have lost investors 2.6 percent this year,
including 0.7 percent this month as of Nov. 21, according to the
 Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index. (BUSY)  They gained 2 percent last
year.  The  extra yield  on 10-year notes versus five-year
securities was 1.40 percentage points yesterday after expanding
to 1.45 percentage points Nov. 21, the widest since August 2011.  The steeper yield curve “reflects the potential for the
Fed to taper,” said Jason Rogan, managing director of U.S.
government trading at Guggenheim Securities LLC, a New York-based brokerage for institutional investors. “It seems the Fed
is ready to taper in December if the data gives them reason
to.”  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators  increased 
net-long position in two-year note futures to the highest level
since August, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data. Speculative long positions, or bets prices will
rise, outnumbered short positions by 34,011 contracts in the
week ending Nov. 19 on the Chicago Board of Trade, up 19
percent, from a week earlier.  Fed Buys  The U.S. is scheduled to sell $32 billion in two-year
notes, $35 billion in five-year debt and $29 billion in seven-year securities on three consecutive days starting Nov. 25.  The five-year notes to be sold may be considered an
additional issue of the outstanding seven year notes sold Nov.
30, 2011, if the auction results in a high yield ranging from
1.375 percent to 1.499 percent, according to the Treasury.  A sale of 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities
Nov. 21 showed not everyone is ready to abandon the notes. The
$13 billion auction attracted the strongest demand since 2011
from a group of investors that includes pension funds and
insurers.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
orders directly with the Treasury, bought 21.5 percent of the
notes, the most since September 2011, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Inflation Adjusted  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and same-maturity TIPS, a gauge of trader expectations for consumer
prices over the life of the debt, was 2.20 percentage points, in
line with the average over the past decade.  “Inflation is not really a concern,” said  Brian Edmonds ,
the head of interest-rates trading in New York at primary dealer
Cantor Fitzgerald LP. “Deflationary pressure is more of a
concern.”  Fed officials said they might reduce $85 billion in monthly
bond purchases “in coming months” as the economy improves,
minutes of their October meeting showed on Nov. 20. The central
bank has said it will keep short-term rates at almost zero at
least as long as unemployment is above 6.5 percent and the
forecast for inflation is below 2.5 percent. The jobless rate in
October was 7.3 percent.  Yields accounting for inflation touched the highest level
in more than two years this week as bond rates increased while
consumer prices remain subdued.  Price Levels  Treasury 10-year notes yielded about 1.78 percent yesterday
after subtracting the cost of living, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. It narrowed from 1.84 percent on Nov. 21, the most since
February 2011, when the yield rose to 2.84 percent.  U.S. consumer prices rose 1 percent in October from the
year before, the Labor Department reported on Nov. 20. It was
the smallest increase since October 2009 as retailers started
discounting before the  holiday shopping season .  Jobless claims in the week ended Nov. 16 dropped by 21,000
to 323,000, the fewest since the week ended Sept. 28, from a
revised 344,000 the previous week, the Labor Department said
Nov. 21 in  Washington . The median forecast of 47 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for a drop to 335,000.  The 10-year yield will rise to 2.90 percent by the end of
March, according to a Bloomberg survey of financial companies
with the most recent forecasts given the heaviest weightings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
