Australia ’s Governor General Quentin Bryce, who is Queen Elizabeth II’s representative in the nation,
supports transition of the country into a republic, according to
an extract of a speech published by the Age newspaper.  Bryce, who retires in March, hopes “one day, one young
girl or boy may even grow up to be our nation’s first head of
state,” the newspaper said, citing a speech to be broadcast on
ABC Radio National tomorrow. She also backs same-sex marriage,
according to the report.  The comments put Bryce at odds with Prime Minister  Tony Abbott , a former head of Australians for a Constitutional
Monarchy, who opposes both a republic and same-sex marriage. The
government in October sued to overturn a law allowing the union
of gay couples in one of the nation’s territories.  Abbott, a practicing Catholic who once studied to become a
priest, said that “from time immemorial” such a “solemnized
relationship has been between a man and a woman,”in a radio
interview in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
