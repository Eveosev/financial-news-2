Meyer Burger Technology AG (MBTN) , the
biggest producer of solar-panel manufacturing equipment, said
Chinese authorities cleared its 357 million-euro ($506 million)
bid to buy German competitor  Roth & Rau AG. (R8R)   China ’s commerce ministry approved the takeover offer of 22
euros per share in writing today, removing the deal’s final
hurdle, Baar, Switzerland-based Meyer Burger said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Meyer Burger acquired 85.67 percent in Roth & Rau and will
settle the shares on August 9, spokesman Werner Buchholz said by
phone. The company will decide in “hours or days” whether to
buy more shares on the open market, he said. Roth & Rau, which
withdrew its full-year earnings forecast last month, was down
0.61 percent at 21.87 euros at 12:20 p.m. in  Frankfurt .  The deal comes as western solar companies seek economies of
scale to cope with falling panel prices and competition from
Asian rivals. Chinese producers such as Suntech Power Holdings
Co. and LDK Solar Co. have ramped up production capacity, a boom
that helped Meyer Burger more than triple profit to 98 million
Swiss francs ($126 million) last year.  Demand for panels in Europe has dropped in 2011 as Germany,
the world’s largest solar market, added about 1,000 megawatts of
panels in the first five months compared with 1,700 megawatts a
year earlier. Roth & Rau on July 22 withdrew its 2011 earnings
forecast on “considerable insecurity” in the solar market and
delayed or canceled orders in  Asia , where the company generates
about 90 percent of its sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
