Coach Inc. (COH) , the largest U.S. luxury
handbag maker, fell the most in more than four months after
saying that a measure of profitability may not improve this year
amid higher costs.  The shares fell $3.65, or 5.6 percent, to $61.64 at 11:38
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Coach earlier
dropped 6.6 percent, the biggest intraday decline since March
15. The stock had risen 18 percent this year before today.  Chief Financial Officer Mike Devine said today on a
conference call to discuss fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that
the company’s gross margin, the share of sales left after
subtracting the cost of goods sold, would be “essentially
flat” in the current fiscal year compared with the previous
year.  “They commented that they wanted us to look at gross
margin as flat for the current year, and I was expecting there
to be some improvement,”  Christine Chen , an analyst with
Needham & Co. in  San Francisco , said in a telephone interview.
“I continue to think that will be the case and that they are
trying to keep expectations low.”  Gross margin narrowed 1.5 percentage points to 71.8 percent
in the fourth quarter because of “continued sourcing
pressures” such as wage inflation in  China , Coach said today.  Net income in the period ended July 2 rose 3.6 percent to
$202.5 million, or 68 cents a share, from $195.5 million, or 64
cents, a year earlier, Coach said today in a statement. The
average estimate of 20 analysts was for profit of 65 cents.  Revenue rose 8.5 percent to $1.03 billion, topping 17
analysts’ $1.01 billion average estimate.  The U.S. Commerce Department reported today that  consumer
spending  dropped 0.2 percent in June, the first decline in
almost two years. The median estimate of 77 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News called for a 0.1 percent increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
