Dominion Petroleum Ltd. (DPL)  said it has
been granted rights to explore another block, known as L15, in
the Lamu Basin off the Indian Ocean coast of  Kenya .  The London-based oil and gas explorer expects to sign the
agreement with the East African nation’s government “in the
coming weeks,” the company said in a statement on its website
dated yesterday. Dominion secured exploration rights for block
L9 off the Kenyan coast in March.  The two-year agreement for L15 will commit the company to
spend at least $2.85 million collecting three-dimensional
seismic data, with an option for two more years, over which time
Dominion must drill at least one well, the statement said.  The company will serve as the operator and have “100
percent working interest” in block L15, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
