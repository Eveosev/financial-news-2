Shares of the following companies had
unusual moves in  Thailand  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the 12:30 p.m. break in
Bangkok.  The SET Index fell 4.92 points, or 0.4 percent, to
1,139.22.  Rubber producers:  Sri Trang Agro-Industry Pcl (STA)  ,
Thailand’s biggest publicly traded rubber producer, dropped 1.6
percent to 30.5 baht, the first decline in six days. Thai Rubber
Latex (Thailand) Corp. (TRUBB TB), a rubber producer, lost 2.5
percent to 5.75 baht, the steepest loss since June 28.  Rubber futures in  Tokyo  declined after data showed U.S.
manufacturing grew at its slowest pace in two years and car
sales in  Japan  dropped, raising concern that demand for the
commodity used in tires and gloves may weaken.  Sugar producers:  Khon Kaen Sugar Industry Pcl (KSL)  , the
bigger of two publicly traded sugar millers, slipped 2.5 percent
to 15.60 baht, the most since June 17. Khonburi Sugar Pcl (KBS
TB) fell 2.9 percent to 13.2 baht.  Sugar futures yesterday fell to a one-week low in  New York 
on signs that global demand is easing after prices surged 30
percent in the past three months.  Indorama Ventures Pcl (IVL)  , a Thai maker of chemicals
used in plastic bottles and polyester, jumped 4.6 percent to 46
baht, poised for the largest increase since July 4. Indorama’s
shares offer a “buying opportunity” after its recent losses,
Paworamon Suvarnatemee, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG,
wrote in a note today. The stock sank 18 percent in the three
months ended July 31.  The company’s earnings may rebound in the second half of
this year, the analyst said.  Richard Jones , Indorama’s
spokesman, was not available for comment on Credit Suisse’s
report after a call to his office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
