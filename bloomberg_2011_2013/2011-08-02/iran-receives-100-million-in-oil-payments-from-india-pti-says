Iran  has received $100 million in
payments from an Indian refiner through Union Bank of India Ltd.
and Istanbul-based  Turkiye Halk Bankasi AS (HALKB) , the Press Trust of
India reported, citing unidentified sources.  Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd. (MRPL)  deposited an
equivalent of $100 million in a rupee account in the New Delhi
branch of Union Bank, which routed an equivalent amount of euros
to the Turkish state-owned bank, according to the report.  Halkbank, as the Turkish lender is called, transferred the
money to the account of National Iranian Oil Co., PTI said.
Other refiners such as Essar Oil Ltd. and Hindustan Petroleum
Corp. will also make payments through the banks, the report
said.  Several refiners in  India , seeking to end an impasse over
payments for Iranian crude, have opened accounts with state-
owned Union Bank of India Ltd. to route money through a lender
in Turkey, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said
on July 29. The people, who declined to be identified because
they weren’t authorized to speak to the media, didn’t disclose
the name of the Turkish bank.  Iran is constrained by international sanctions over its
nuclear program, and Indian refiners say banks are unwilling to
transfer payments for their purchases of the Persian nation’s
oil. India owes $5 billion for crude, Iranian central bank
governor Mahmoud Bahmani said July 18. Iran is the second-
largest oil producer in OPEC after  Saudi Arabia .  Link to Company News:
