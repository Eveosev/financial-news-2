Weir Group Plc (WEIR) , the world’s biggest
maker of pumps for the  mining industry , said full-year profit
will be “somewhat ahead” of previous forecasts, because of
higher sales in the company’s oil and gas business.  Revenue in the unit, which is mainly generated in  North
America , is set to reach $850 million this year, $100 million
more than Weir had forecast, Chief Executive Officer Keith Cochrane said today on a conference call.  “That reflects very strong market conditions and will flow
through into profits,” Cochrane said.  Weir, which is based in Glasgow,  Scotland , is benefiting
from the face that more than half of North American rigs are
currently focused on oil, a level not seen since the mid-1990s.
The company is bringing forward spending on new facilities to
increase its manufacturing capacity in the region by 20 percent.  Net income in the six months ended July 1 increased to
119.4 million pounds ($195 million), or 56.1 pence a share, from
96.1 million pounds, or 45.2 pence, a year earlier, Weir said in
a statement today.  Revenue rose 33 percent to 1.03 billion pounds and the
order book was 43 percent up at a record 1.23 billion pounds at
the end of the period.  Weir has as much as 600 million pounds available for
acquisitions, Cochrane said. “We are keen to develop our
footprint in emerging markets,” he said.  The shares fell 14 pence to 2,072 pence in London trading,
the fifth straight day of declines, paring the gain this year to
16 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
