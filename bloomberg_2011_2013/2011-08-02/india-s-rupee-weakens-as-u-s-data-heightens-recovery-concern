India ’s rupee weakened on concern a
slowing U.S. economy will stall the global economic recovery,
sapping demand for emerging-market assets.  The currency declined by the most in three weeks after a
report showed yesterday that manufacturing in the world’s
largest economy dropped to a two-year low in July. Foreign
investors sold $140.2 million more Indian shares than they
bought on July 29, the most in two weeks, according to exchange
data. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of regional stocks fell by the
most since July 12, while the Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive
Index lost 1 percent.  “The U.S. data has affected the region’s currencies as it
has once again raised questions about the recovery,” said  Roy Paul , deputy general manager at Federal Bank Ltd. in Mumbai.
“There are probably some concerns about fund inflows.”  The rupee weakened 0.4 percent to 44.2325 per dollar as of
10:03 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It advanced 1.2 percent last month, the most since March.  The U.S.’s  Institute for Supply Management ’s manufacturing
index dropped to 50.9 last month from 55.3 in June, less than
the median estimate of 54.5 in a Bloomberg survey.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 44.63 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations for a
rate of 44.44 yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
