Uganda ’s shilling weakened for a
fifth day against the dollar after the central bank yesterday
sold the U.S. currency and today increased its lending rate.  The currency of  Africa ’s second-biggest coffee producer
slipped 0.1 percent to 2,650 by 3:49 p.m. in the capital,
Kampala, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Yesterday’s sale of dollars has had an impact on the
market,” Lucas Ochieng, a currency trader at Orient Bank Ltd.,
said by phone from Kampala, without giving further details.  The central bank raised its benchmark  interest rate  by 1
percentage point to 14 percent, one month after introducing the
rate, to help curb inflation and bolster the currency, Governor
Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile told reporters today in the capital,
Kampala.  The shilling has depreciated 9.7 percent against the dollar
in the last two months, making it the world’s worst performer in
the period. A surge in food and fuel prices pushed inflation to
a more than 18-year high of 18.7 percent this month from 15.7
percent in June, the statistics office said on July 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
