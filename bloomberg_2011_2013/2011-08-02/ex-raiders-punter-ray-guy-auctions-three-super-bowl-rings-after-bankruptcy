Former Raiders punter Ray Guy sold
his three Super Bowl championship rings for $96,216 at auction
to help pay off his debts as part of a bankruptcy case.  Guy, 61, who played in seven Pro Bowls during his 14-year
career, won Super Bowl titles with the  Oakland Raiders  following
the 1976 and 1980 seasons and with the Los Angeles Raiders after
the 1983 National Football League season.  He filed for bankruptcy protection in Augusta,  Georgia , in
April 2010 and got authorization May 23 to sell the rings,
according to court records.  The rings were sold by  Nate D. Sanders Inc. , the Los
Angeles-based auction house that issued a news release yesterday
with the final sales price. The auction company said each ring
contained at least 22 diamonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
