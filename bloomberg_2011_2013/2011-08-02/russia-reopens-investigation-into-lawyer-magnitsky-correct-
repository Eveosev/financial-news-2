(Corrects to show probe of Magnitsky continues.)  Russian investigators reopened their
investigation into tax-fraud charges against Sergei Magnitsky,
the lawyer for Hermitage Capital Management Ltd. who died in a
Moscow prison in 2009,  Kommersant  reported.  The case was returned to investigators last week after a
ruling by the Constitutional Court, the Moscow-based newspaper
said today, citing an unidentified official in the Prosecutor
Generalâ€™s Office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
