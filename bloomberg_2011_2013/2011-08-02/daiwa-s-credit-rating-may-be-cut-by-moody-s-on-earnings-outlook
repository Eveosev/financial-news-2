Daiwa Securities Group Inc. (8601) ’s debt
rating may be cut by Moody’s Investors Service, which cited
downward pressure on earnings at the Japanese brokerage.  Moody’s said it placed Daiwa’s senior unsecured debt rating
on review for possible downgrade from the current Baa2, the
second-lowest investment grade.  An “earnings recovery is becoming increasingly
challenging, given the current negative operating environment,
as evidenced by the slowdown in capital markets activities in
the domestic market,” the rating company said in a statement
today.  Daiwa,  Japan ’s second-biggest brokerage, last week posted a
loss that widened to 9.4 billion yen ($122 million) in the three
months ended June from 1.2 billion yen a year earlier as
staffing costs rose and commissions fell. The Tokyo-based firm
said it would merge its brokerage and investment banking units
in April to cut costs.  “A merger of the two subsidiaries would be credit positive
for Daiwa since it would reduce overall operating expenses by
streamlining overlapping operations,” Moody’s said. “It will
also offer more flexibility in terms of reallocation of
personnel to the retail business.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
