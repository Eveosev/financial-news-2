Ethanol futures were little changed
in  Chicago  as corn increased on concern that hot weather damaged
crop yields and amid signs of slowing fuel demand.  The grain-based biofuel was steady amid speculation a heat
wave that blanketed the corn-rich Midwest in July will hinder
supply of the main feedstock used to make ethanol in the U.S.
Separately, a Commerce Department report showed  consumer
spending  dropped for the first time in almost two years.  “This weather has kind of done some damage,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at INTL FCStone Group in De Moines,
 Iowa . “Ethanol was trying to follow corn, but it feels weak.
The energies didn’t help. We’re getting stagnant in gasoline
production and consumption.”  Denatured ethanol for August delivery rose 0.2 cent to
settle at $2.842 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures
have gained 20 percent this year.  In cash market trading ethanol in  New York  plunged 10
cents, or 3.4 percent, to $2.885 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive decreased 9 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $2.785, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf slumped 5 cents, or 1.7 percent,
to $2.925 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel slipped 1
cent, or 0.3 percent, to $3.015.  Corn for December delivery surged the exchange-limit 30
cents, or 4.4 percent, to $7.1575 a bushel in Chicago, the
highest price for a most-active contract since June 9. One
bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  MasterCard Inc. said in its weekly SpendingPulse report
that gasoline demand was down 3.1 percent from a year earlier.
Ethanol is blended with the fuel to boost supply and meet
federal mandates.  Gasoline for September delivery dropped 1.67 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $3.0373 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the lowest settlement price since July 6. The contract
covers reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with
ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  On a spot basis, an average ethanol mill in Iowa is making
8 cents on every gallon of the fuel, while a typical plant in
 Illinois  is pocketing 18 cents, according to Ag TraderTalk, a
Clive, Iowa-based online grains information service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
