MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS) , the
pay-as-you-go wireless operator, fell the most since its initial
public offering in 2007 after missing analysts’ estimates for
revenue in the second quarter.  MetroPCS, based in Dallas, slid $5.92, or 37 percent, to
$10.26 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange trading, for the
largest drop since April 2007. The company reported revenue of
$1.21 billion, compared with the $1.23 billion that analysts
estimated on average according to a Bloomberg survey.  Net income rose to $84 million, or 23 cents a share, from
$80 million, or 22 cents a share. That fell short of the 29
cents a share estimate from  Craig Moffett , an analyst with
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Monthly churn, or the rate of lost
customers, increased to 3.9 percent, compared with Moffett’s 3.3
percent estimate.  MetroPCS “missed on all metrics by a small amount,” Moffett
said in a research note, “but which, as a result, missed where
it matters (free  cash flow ) by a lot.”  The company also said it plans $900 million to $1 billion
in  capital expenditures , up from a previous forecast of $700
million to $900 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
