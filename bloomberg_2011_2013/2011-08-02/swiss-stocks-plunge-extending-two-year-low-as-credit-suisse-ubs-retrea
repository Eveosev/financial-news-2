Swiss stocks tumbled the most in 2
1/2 years as the franc strengthened to a record against the euro
amid concern that U.S. growth is slowing and speculation the
world’s largest economy may lose its top credit rating.  Switzerland’s biggest banks led losses as  UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  slid more than 7 percent.  Straumann Holding AG (STMN) ,
a dental implant maker, sank 4.8 percent and  Lonza Group AG (LONN) , a
supplier to drug companies, retreated 7.2 percent.  Clariant AG (CLN) ,
the maker of pigments and emulsions, plunged 11 percent.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI) , a measure of the largest and most
actively traded companies, plunged 4.1 percent to 5,546.94 at
the 5:30 p.m. close in Zurich. That’s the biggest decline since
March 2009, the longest losing streak since 2003 and the lowest
level in two years. The gauge has tumbled 17 percent from this
year’s high on Feb. 18 on concern that Europe’s sovereign-debt
crisis will spread from Greece to Italy and Spain. The broader
Swiss Performance Index lost 4.1 percent today.  “The markets don’t approve of the debt-ceiling agreement
yet,” said  Manfred Hofer , senior investment analyst at LGT
Capital Management AG in Pfaeffikon,  Switzerland . “It can be
assumed that the rating agencies will downgrade the AAA rating
of the U.S. That puts a strain on the dollar and leads investors
to the Swiss franc, which is considered a safe haven.”  The Swiss franc strengthened to 1.10 against the euro today
for the first time since records began.  U.S. Debt Limit  The House of Representatives approved legislation yesterday
to increase the U.S. debt limit by at least $2.1 trillion and
cut spending by $2.4 trillion. Today was the Treasury
Department’s deadline to lift the debt ceiling.  The deficit deal will add to a reduction in growth next
year of 1.5 percentage points coming from the expiration of past
stimulus programs, according to economists at JPMorgan Chase &
Co. and Deutsche Bank Securities.  A report yesterday, when the Swiss equity market was closed
for a holiday, showed manufacturing in the U.S. almost stalled
in July. The Institute for Supply Management’s factory index
slumped to 50.9, from 55.3 in June. Figures less than 50 signal
contraction. Separate data last week showed that the  U.S.
economy  grew less than forecast in the second quarter.  “Investors are especially anxious about the U.S. economy
and fear the developments could affect corporate profits
negatively,” Hofer said.  UBS, Credit Suisse  UBS plunged 7.7 percent to 12.10 francs, the biggest drop
since May 2009.  Credit Suisse slumped 7.4 percent to 26.35 francs, the
largest drop since January 2009. Teresa Nielsen, an analyst at
Vontobel Holding AG, reduced her earnings-per-share estimate for
the stock in 2012 to 3.69 francs from 4.05 francs, citing
“weaker gross margin levels in wealth management and lower than
previously expected investment bank revenue.”  Straumann tumbled 4.8 percent to 171 francs. “The rising
Swiss franc is hurting the company’s margins, as well as macro
concerns over strength of the U.S. economy,” said Thomas Deitz,
an equity analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  A gauge of European health-care companies fell 1.9 percent,
the most since March. Lonza declined 7.2 percent to 62.40
francs, while  Novartis AG (NOVN)  slipped 4.5 percent to 46.31 francs.
 Sonova Holding AG (SOON) , a hearing-aid maker, slid 5.8 percent to
70.25 francs.  Clariant slumped 11 percent to 11.13 francs, its lowest
price since February 2010, leading the Stoxx 600 Chemicals Index
to a decline of 2.5 percent.  Syngenta AG (SYNN) , the world’s biggest
producer of crop-protection chemicals, retreated 6 percent to
237.90 francs.  Givaudan SA (GIVN) , the largest maker of flavors and
fragrances, dropped 3.9 percent 830 francs.  Logitech International SA, the world’s biggest maker of
computer mice, plunged 7.1 percent to 7.05 francs, its lowest
price since January 2000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
