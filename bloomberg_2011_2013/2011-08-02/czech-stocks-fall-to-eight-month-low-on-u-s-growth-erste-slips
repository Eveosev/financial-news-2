The Czech Republic’s benchmark stock
index fell to its lowest in eight months as  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) 
and  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  slumped amid concern that a slowdown in
the  U.S. economy  is derailing the global recovery.  The PX equity gauge slumped 0.9 percent to 1,168.2 at the
4:28 p.m. close in Prague, the lowest since Dec. 8. Austria’s
Erste lost 3 percent to 781 koruna and Komercni, the Czech unit
of Societe Generale SA, slid 1.3 percent to 3,770 koruna. The
two lenders have a combined 39 percent weighting in the index.  Stocks dropped and investors bought U.S. Treasuries and the
Swiss franc after a report showed personal spending unexpectedly
fell in the U.S. A report yesterday showed the country’s
manufacturing sank to a two-year low. Attention has shifted to
economic data after the  House of Representatives  yesterday voted
to increase the borrowing limit to avert default.  Declining spending in the U.S. “may be a signal that the
world’s largest economy is losing steam,” Miroslav Adamkovic, a
Komercni analyst in Prague, said in an e-mailed report today.
“The approval of the debt-ceiling increase by the U.S. House of
Representatives failed to stop the stock markets’ retreat.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
