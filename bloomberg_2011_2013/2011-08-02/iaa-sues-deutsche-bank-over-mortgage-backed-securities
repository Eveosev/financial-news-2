Teachers Insurance & Annuity
Association of America sued Deutsche Bank AG in  New York  state
court for fraud over residential mortgage-backed securities the
Frankfurt-based bank sold it.  TIAA invested in the securities unaware that the bank
internally viewed the loans and securities as “pigs” and
“crap,” according to the suit, filed yesterday in New York
state Supreme Court.  The suit duplicates wording and claims that  Dexia SA (DEXB) , the
lender to local governments rescued by France and Belgium in
2008, made in a similar suit filed against Deutsche Bank last
month in connection with more than $1 billion in residential
mortgage-backed securities.  Deutsche Bank,  Germany ’s biggest bank, originated,
purchased, financed and securitized “exception” loans into the
securities while betting against the U.S. housing market as far
back as 2005, ultimately developing a $10 billion short position
that paid off when the loans backing the securities failed,
according to the TIAA complaint.  “We will vigorously defend ourselves against this suit
which we believe is without merit,”  Renee Calabro , a
spokesperson for Deutsche Bank, said in an e-mailed statement.
The bank gave the same response to the Dexia suit.  TIAA is a New York corporation that provides annuities,
life and other insurance and pension plan counseling to
employees of educational and other nonprofit institutions.  The case is Teachers Insurance & Annuity Association of
America v.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , 652122/2011, New York state Supreme
Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
