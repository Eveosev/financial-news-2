Nigeria ’s dollar-bond yields
retreated to a record as low domestic debt levels in sub-Saharan
Africa’s second-biggest economy relative to  Europe  boost the
asset’s allure.  The yield on the 6.75 percent Eurobonds due 2021 of
Africa’s biggest oil producer fell for a third day, losing four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 5.72 percent, the
lowest level since the debt was issued in January, as of 4:47
p.m. in  London , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
bonds’ price gained 0.3 percent to 107.458 cents on the dollar.
The $500 million of bonds are Nigeria’s only international
notes.  The federal government’s domestic debt rose to 5.21
trillion naira ($34 billion) at the end of June, from 4.87
trillion naira as of March, according to  statements  on the
website of the Abuja-based Debt Management Office. Nigeria has
an overall debt-to-GDP ratio of around 23 percent, said  Razia Khan , the London-based head of African economic research at
Standard Chartered Bank Ltd. The eurozone’s average debt as a
percentage of GDP was 85.1 percent by the end of 2010, according
to Eurostat.  “Although domestic debt has been rising steadily and it’s
overall debt to GDP ratios are now 22 percent to 23 percent from
really minimal levels a few years ago, that would be still
considered attractive in the overall global context,” Khan said
by phone today. Yields falling “really reflect the size of
investor appetite relative to how little there is still.”  Africa’s most populous nation is rated B+ by  Standard &
Poor’s , and BB- with a “negative” outlook by  Fitch Ratings .
The assessments are the fourth-highest junk ratings at the two
companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
