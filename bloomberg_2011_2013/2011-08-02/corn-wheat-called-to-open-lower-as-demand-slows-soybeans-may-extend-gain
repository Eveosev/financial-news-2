What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel
lower on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that demand
will slow after a 69 percent rally in prices during the past
year and an unexpected drop in U.S. personal income,  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst for Northstar Commodity Investment
Co. in Minneapolis, said in a telephone interview.  -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  as rising production in Russia, Ukraine and India
reduces demand for supplies from the U.S., the worldâ€™s largest
exporter, Schultz said.  -- Soybean futures may open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel higher in
Chicago after a government report showed hot, dry weather eroded
conditions of the U.S. crop for a third consecutive week,
Schultz said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open steady to
up 0.1 cent a pound, and soybean-meal futures may open steady to
$1 lower for 2,000 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
