Radian Group Inc. (RDN) , the second-largest
U.S. mortgage insurer, climbed the most since last year after
the company swung to a profit on derivative gains and said there
was a drop in delinquencies on home loans.  Radian rose 47 cents, or 15 percent, to $3.55 at 4:02 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange Composite trading. The Philadelphia-
based company has declined 56 percent this year.  Second-quarter profit of $137.1 million, or $1.03 a share,
compared with a loss of $475.1 million, or $4.31, a year
earlier, Radian said in a statement today. Derivative gains of
$188.7 million boosted results. Radian said its risk-to-capital
ratio was less than 20, compared with 25 at rival  Genworth
Financial Inc. (GNW) ’s mortgage unit, a level that brings greater
scrutiny from state regulators.  “Radian’s risk-to-capital ratio of 19.8-to-1 and the
financial flexibility of our holding company cash position
provide a competitive advantage for our mortgage insurance
business,” Chief Executive Officer S.A. Ibrahim said in the
statement.  Delinquent loans dropped about 5 percent in the second
quarter from the first, the sixth straight decline for Radian,
according to the statement. The company pays lenders when
homeowners default and foreclosure fails to recoup costs.  MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG) , the largest mortgage insurer,
slipped 4 cents to $3.90. No. 3  PMI Group Inc. (PMI)  dropped 7.8
percent. Genworth, which also sells  life insurance , dropped 5.5
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
