Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average fell,
paring yesterday’s gains, as U.S. manufacturing grew at the
slowest pace in two years, pushing down Asian exporters even
after lawmakers in  Washington  approved legislation to raise the
nation’s debt limit before a threatened default.  Nikon Corp. (7731) , a camera maker that counts  North America  as
its biggest market, declined 2.9 percent.  NTN Corp. (6472) , a bearing
maker, slumped 5.7 percent.  Tokyo Electron Ltd. (8035) , a maker of
semiconductor equipment maker that yesterday slashed its profit
forecast and dividend, plunged 6.2 percent.  The Nikkei 225 fell 1.2 percent to 9,844.59 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo. The gauge yesterday climbed the most in a month
on signs congressional leaders were ready to strike a deal on
raising the U.S. government’s borrowing authority. The broader
Topix index dropped 0.9 percent today to 843.96.  The U.S. manufacturing report showed “the economy is
slowing globally, and that heightens uncertainties about the
outlook of earnings at companies expecting recovery in the
second-half period,” said  Kenichi Hirano , general manager and
strategist at Tachibana Securities Co. in  Tokyo .  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.4 percent in  New
York  yesterday as slower-than-forecast growth in manufacturing
erased a rally triggered by speculation lawmakers would raise
the federal debt ceiling.  House Votes  Futures on the index slid 0.3 percent today after the House
approved legislation to raise the debt limit one day before a
threatened default.  The House voted 269-161 for the plan negotiated by leaders
and President  Barack Obama  over the weekend. The agreement,
approved by the House and set to be considered in the Senate,
would cut the federal deficit while raising the nation’s debt
ceiling by $2.1 trillion. The deal contains $917 billion in
spending cuts, with the balance to come later this year from a
special committee of lawmakers.  Exporters and makers of machinery and parts dropped after a
report showed U.S. manufacturing expanded in July at the slowest
pace in two years, indicating the industry that’s been driving
the economic expansion is starting to weaken. The  Institute for
Supply Management ’s factory index fell to 50.9 last month from
55.3 in June. Economists projected the index would drop to 54.5,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.
Figures greater than 50 signal expansion.  Nikon, Olympus  Nikon retreated 2.9 percent to 1,808 yen.  Olympus Corp. (7733) , an
optical-equipment maker which gets more than 20 percent of its
revenue in North America, dropped 1.5 percent to 2,711 yen.
 Kyocera Corp. (6971) , a manufacturer of solar panels that gets 17
percent of its sales in the U.S., lost 1.2 percent to 8,230 yen.  Makers of factory equipment and machinery parts declined as
a group by the most since May 23. NTN slumped 5.7 percent to 448
yen. SMC Corp., a maker of pneumatic equipment and controls,
tumbled 4.8 percent to 14,010 yen. Parts-maker THK Co. retreated
5.1 percent to 1,972 yen.  Stocks also fell after the yen appreciated to as high as
76.30 against the dollar yesterday, the strongest level since
March. Against the euro,  Japan ’s currency strengthened to 108.72
from 111.72 at the close of  stock trading  in Tokyo yesterday. A
stronger yen hurts Japanese exporters because it cuts the value
of overseas sales.  The yen pared its gains against the dollar to 77.82 today
after the Nikkei newspaper reported the Japanese government is
preparing steps to reverse the currency’s recent appreciation
and the  Bank of Japan  may consider a 5 trillion ($65 billion) to
10 trillion yen expansion of a 40 trillion yen asset-buying fund
at an Aug. 4- 5 meeting.  ‘Less Attractive’  “Investing in Japanese shares isn’t that attractive
because the U.S. economic outlook is dimming and the yen is
appreciating,” said  Yoshinori Nagano , a senior strategist in
Tokyo at Daiwa Asset　Management Co., which oversees about $104
billion. “Investors are also concerned fiscal tightening by the
U.S. government will be a problem while the economy is
weakening.”  Tokyo Electron tumbled 6.2 percent to 3,940 yen, the lowest
close since Sept. 1. The company cut its full-year profit
forecast by 49 percent to 34 billion yen because of falling chip
gear prices and slowing capital spending among semiconductor
makers. The company slashed its planned second-half dividend to
22 yen from 85 yen.  Other chip-related companies also declined. Dainippon
Screen Manufacturing Co., a maker of equipment used to lay down
circuit patterns on semiconductor wafers, plunged 6.2 percent
579 yen. Nomura Holdings Inc.’s analyst Tetsuya Wadaki yesterday
cut his rating on the company to “neutral” from “buy,”
saying orders are likely to drop in the July-September period.  Advantest, Sumco  Advantest Corp. (6857) , the world’s biggest maker of memory-chip
testers, declined 2.2 percent to 1,346 yen. Sumco Corp., a maker
of silicon wafers, fell 1.6 percent to 1,227 yen.  Among stocks that rose, Sumitomo Corp., Japan’s fourth-
largest trading company by market value, advanced 3 percent to
1,123 yen, the most on the Nikkei. Profit increased by 36
percent to 83.6 billion yen ($1.08 billion), a record for the
fiscal first quarter, Chief Financial Officer Toyosaku Hamada
told reporters in Tokyo today. The result beat the 60.3 billion
yen avrage of four analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Nippon Soda Co., a chemicals maker, advanced 2.4 percent to
382 yen. The company boosted its profit forecast by 33 percent
to 3.2 billion yen for the six months ending Sept. 30, citing an
increase in overseas sales of agricultural chemicals.  To contact the reporters on this story:
