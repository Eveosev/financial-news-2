An Angolan court sentenced five
former central bank officials to up to eight years in prison for
stealing $5 million from the bank, Radio Nacional de Angola
reported, citing Judge Januario Jose.  The officials will also be required to repay money taken
and forfeit property, the Luanda-based broadcaster today cited
Jose as saying.  The case is part of alleged fraud of about $160 million
that was transferred to overseas accounts in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
