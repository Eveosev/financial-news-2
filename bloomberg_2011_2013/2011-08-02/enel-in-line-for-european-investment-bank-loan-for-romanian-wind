Enel Green Power SpA (EGPW) , a unit of
Italy’s biggest power company, may receive as much as 200
million euros ($284 million) in funding from the  European
Investment Bank  to build three wind farms offshore Romania.  “The European Investment Bank confirms that it is
currently evaluating a possible loan of 200 million euros to
Enel Green Power Romania,” Richard Willis, a spokesman for the
EIB, said in an e-mail today. The loan represents 50 percent of
the projects’ total cost, according to the bank.  Last month the European Commission cleared Romania’s
program to support renewable energy developments including a
 wind energy  and solar plants. So-called green certificates,
worth 27.70 euros to 56.10 euros, are granted to producers of
electricity from clean sources for each megawatt-hour generated.  The three Romanian on-shore wind farms will be located in
the regions of Dobrogea and Banat with a total installed
capacity of 258 megawatts. The farms will be equipped with 126
turbines and have a capacity ranging from 2 megawatts to 2.3
megawatts.  Enel, based in  Rome , also is developing wind farms in Latin
America and North America. Romania has 462 megawatts of
installed onshore wind projects, according to the  European Wind
Energy Association.  The country trails six other European
nations, led by  Spain , in the capacity it installed last year.  EIB declined to comment on the loan’s maturity or interest
because the agreement hasn’t yet been finalized.  To contact the reporter on this story:
