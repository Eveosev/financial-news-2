Tanzania’s shilling headed for the
strongest close in a week against the dollar after the central
bank of East  Africa ’s second biggest economy’s sold the U.S.
currency to curb the shilling’s decline to a 17-year low.  The shilling appreciated as much as 0.3 percent to 1,586.35
per dollar and traded 0.2 percent stronger at 1,588.5 by 12:10
p.m. in  Dar es Salaam , the commercial capital. A close at this
level would be the highest since July 27.  “We have seen the Bank of Tanzania come in today to sell
dollars,” Yonoh Mtegule, senior economist at National Bank of
Commerce Ltd.,  Absa Group Ltd. (ASA) ’s Tanzanian unit, said by phone,
without providing further details.  Tanzania’s central bank regularly intervenes in the market,
selling $80 million and $120 million dollars a month to
stabilize the shilling, according to  information  on its website.  The central bank declined to provide more detail on
currency sales, an official who didn’t want to be named said by
phone today.  Tanzania’s shilling has weakened 5.2 percent against the
dollar over the past six months, making it the fourth worst-
performing currency in Africa after the Kenyan and Ugandan
shillings and  Sudan ’s pound. It reached 1,632.9 on July 5, the
weakest level since at least October 1994, as inflation
accelerated to 10.9 percent in June, the fastest pace in 14
months, on higher food and energy costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
