Ukraine is donating radiation
measuring devices and gas masks to  Japan  as it battles the
world’s worst nuclear crisis since the Chernobyl explosion in
the former Soviet territory 25 years ago.  Ukraine’s government will supply 2,000 personal dosimeters
and radiometers and 1,000 gas masks on Aug. 4 “at the request
of the Japanese leadership,” the Ukrainian embassy in Tokyo
said today in an e-mailed statement. A ceremony for the handover
will be held on Aug. 9 in Fukushima city.  Nearly five months after an earthquake and tsunami wrecked
the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear station, public anxiety over
radiation is rising as cases of food contamination increase. The
concerns are compounded by a shortage of Geiger counters, also
known as dosimeters.  Tokyo Electric Power Co. yesterday reported a reading of 10
sieverts per hour at the damaged plant, which is the maximum
reading on the Geiger counter used at the site and the highest
since the disaster began. A single dose of 10 sieverts would
kill a person “within a few weeks,” according to the World
Nuclear Association website.  Tepco, as the utility is also known, has been criticized by
the government for withholding radiation data and undermining
public trust. Radiation leaks from the Fukushima reactors have
spread over 600 square kilometers and 160,000 people have been
evacuated from near the plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
