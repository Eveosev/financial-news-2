A private box at  London ’s Royal
Albert Hall is up for sale, with a guide price of 550,000 pounds
($896,500), the London-based Times reported.  Box 38, in the second tier, is the only one that still has
the original timber veneer and mirrored panels of 1871,
according to Harrods Estates, which is handling the sale, the
newspaper said.  Boxes and seats at the hall were sold at the outset to
defray the hall’s construction costs, and about 1,300 of the
5,000 seats, both in boxes and stalls, are privately owned, the
Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
