Australian home-building approvals
unexpectedly declined in June for a third straight month and
 house prices  fell, prompting the local currency to pare gains as
traders reduced bets on an interest-rate increase this year.  The number of permits granted to build or renovate houses
and apartments slid 3.5 percent from May, when they dropped a
revised 6.3 percent, the Bureau of Statistics said in Sydney
today. A separate index measuring the weighted average of prices
for established houses in eight major cities declined 0.1
percent last quarter to the lowest level since 2009.  Reserve Bank  of Australia Governor  Glenn Stevens  today will
keep the developed world’s highest interest rates unchanged at
4.75 percent, according to most economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News, after the labor market lost 5,400 jobs in the April-June
period, the weakest quarter since 2001. The RBA increased rates
seven times from October 2009 to November, helping drive the
currency to a record.  “Interest-rate sensitive sectors in the economy are soft
and responding to the central bank’s mildly restrictive
policy,” said Su-Lin Ong, head of Australian economic and
fixed-income strategy at  RBC Capital Markets  in Sydney. “For
the RBA, it probably confirms the trends in place for a while
that its policy stance is still working its way through the
economy.”  Currency Falls  The local currency declined to $1.0981 at 12:20 p.m. in
Sydney from $1.0993 before the data. Traders see a 14 percent
chance the RBA will boost borrowing costs by a quarter
percentage point today, interbank cash rate futures show.  Today’s report showed house prices fell 1 percent in Perth
and dropped 1.6 percent in Darwin from the previous quarter,
while they advanced 0.4 percent in Sydney and gained 1.1 percent
in Canberra. In  Melbourne , prices slipped 0.1 percent.  A jump in  home prices  was among reasons Stevens increased
the benchmark rate by 175 basis points from October 2009.  Building approvals fell 15.5 percent from a year earlier,
the report showed. That compares with economists’ forecast for a
10.3 percent drop year-over-year.  Approvals to build private houses dropped 3.2 percent to
7,604 in June from the previous month, the report showed.
Approvals for apartments and renovations declined 4.2 percent to
4,274.  To contact the reporter on this story:
