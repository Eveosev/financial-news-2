Copersucar SA, the Brazilian sugar-
trading cooperative that accounts for 10 percent of global sugar
exports, scrapped a $1.7 billion initial public offer in  Brazil 
citing market conditions and the global economic environment.  A cancellation request from the Sao Paulo-based company was
posted on Brazil’s securities regulator website today.  The IPO was canceled on continued “unfavorable market
conditions that caused the postponement of the offering on July
20,” Copersucar said in an e-mailed statement. “The company
plans to resume IPO plans at a later date.”  Copersucar and its 26 shareholders planned to raise as much
as 2.7 billion reais ($1.7 billion) in what could have been
Brazil’s largest IPO in two years. The company aimed to sell as
many as 145.9 million shares, including possible supplementary
offerings, for 14.50 reais to 18.50 reais apiece, according to a
June 30 preliminary prospectus.  At least nine companies have shelved IPOs in Brazil this
year, data compiled by Bloomberg and the securities regulator
show. Eight of the 10 that had IPOs priced them at the bottom of
projected ranges or below. Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa index fell
16 percent this year into a  bear market  on July 27, after
dropping 20 percent from its bull-market peak in November 2010.  Copersucar said in the statement it will proceed with plans
to invest 2 billion reais by 2015 to expand its sugar export
capacity at the port of Santos, Brazil’s largest for the
sweetener.  To contact the reporter on this story:
