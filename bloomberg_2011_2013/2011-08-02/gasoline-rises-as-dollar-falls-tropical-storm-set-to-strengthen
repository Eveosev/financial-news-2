Gasoline fell after a government
report showed  consumer spending  in the U.S. dropped amid a slump
in hiring, an indication of weak demand for the motor fuel.  Futures declined 0.6 percent after the Commerce Department
said purchases dropped for the first time in almost two years.
The U.S. currency strengthened 0.4 percent against the euro as
of 3:12 p.m. in  New York , lessening the investment appeal of
dollar-denominated materials.  “Nobody can drive, consumer spending is down,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago . “It’s
another sign that the economy is down.”  September-delivery gasoline fell 1.67 cents to settle at
$3.0373 on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , after touching
$3.0924. It’s the lowest settlement since July 6.  U.S. consumer spending slipped 0.2 percent in June,
Commerce Department figures showed. The median estimate of 77
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a 0.1 percent
increase.  Incomes grew 0.1 percent in June, the slowest pace since
November, according to the government report. Economists had
forecast incomes would rise 0.2 percent, according to the
Bloomberg survey. The jobless rate climbed to 9.2 percent in
June while payrolls grew by 18,000, the fewest in nine months.  Prices rose as much as 1.3 percent earlier after the dollar
slipped to $1.4283 against the euro.  “This seems to be tied to the dollar,” said  Tom Knight ,
vice president of trading and supply at Truman Arnold Cos. in
Texarkana, Texas.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.2
cent to $3.703 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.  Heating oil for September delivery fell 0.58 cent, or 0.2
percent, to settle at $3.0916 a gallon on the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
