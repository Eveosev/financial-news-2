Egypt’s central bank accepted bids
for seven-day  repurchase agreements  valued at 1.19 billion
Egyptian pounds ($200 million), all the bids made.  The contracts, or repos, allow government security holders
to sell them back to the central bank for a week to access funds
in exchange for paying an interest rate of 9.25 percent,
according to Central Bank of Egypt data on Bloomberg. It had
offered to accept as much as 3 billion pounds in bids.  The central bank started the facility in March as local
banks used more of their funds to buy  government securities 
after foreign investors left in the aftermath of a revolt that
toppled President  Hosni Mubarak . The leader is due in court
tomorrow to be tried for alleged corruption and ordering the
killing of demonstrators.  The yield on  Egypt ’s 10-year dollar bond rose one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.52 percent at 2:56 p.m. in
Cairo. The pound’s six-month non-deliverable forwards gained 0.2
percent to 6.24 per dollar, reflecting the expectation for the
currency to weaken 4.6 percent over that period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
