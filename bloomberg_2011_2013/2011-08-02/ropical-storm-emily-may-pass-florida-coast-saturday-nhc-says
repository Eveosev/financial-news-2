Tropical Storm Emily is forecast to
strengthen today as it approaches the  Dominican Republic  in the
Caribbean Sea on a path that may take it past Florida’s east
coast on Aug. 6.  Emily is about 265 miles (425 kilometers) southeast of San
Juan,  Puerto Rico , traveling west at 14 miles per hour,
according to an advisory issued by the U.S.  National Hurricane
Center  at 8 a.m. in Miami. Emily has tropical storm-force winds
of 40 mph and is still “poorly organized,” the center said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
