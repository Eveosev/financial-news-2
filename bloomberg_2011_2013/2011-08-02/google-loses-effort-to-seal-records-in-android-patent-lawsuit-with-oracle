Google Inc. (GOOG) , the world’s largest
Internet search company, lost a bid to seal papers in a patent-
infringement lawsuit filed last year by a unit of software maker
 Oracle Corp. (ORCL)   Claiming attorney-client privilege, Google sought to
protect parts of a transcript of a hearing about expert
witnesses containing references to a company document, U.S.
District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco said in an order
yesterday.  The document is “an incomplete draft of an e-mail
message” and “never was sent to anyone,” Alsup wrote in
denying Mountain View, California-based Google’s request.
“Thus, the document is not a communication of any type, much
less a communication protected by the attorney-client
privilege.”  Oracle America Inc., based in  Redwood City ,  California ,
sued Google, alleging patent infringement over the use of Java
technology in Google’s Android operating system in an Oct. 27
amended complaint.  Alsup wrote in a July 22 filing that the passage in
question was from an internal e-mail in 2010 to Google executive
Andy Rubin saying “the technical alternatives to using Java for
Android ‘all suck’ and stating, ‘we conclude that we need to
negotiate a license for Java under the terms we need.’”  “We aren’t commenting on this,” Katelin Todhunter-
Gerberg, a Google spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed message.  The case is Oracle America Inc. v. Google Inc., 3:10-cv-
03561, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California ( San
Francisco ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
