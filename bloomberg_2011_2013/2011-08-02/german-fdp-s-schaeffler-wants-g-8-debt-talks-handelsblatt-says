Frank Schaeffler , a German lawmaker
from Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s Free Democratic Party coalition
partner, called for a global summit on sovereign debt to be held
under the auspices of the Group of Eight,  Handelsblatt  reported,
citing an interview.  Merkel should argue for such a summit in the light of the
debt crises in  Europe  and the U.S., Schaeffler said, according
to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
