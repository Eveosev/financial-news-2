The risk of a U.S. sovereign default
remains “extremely low,” Fitch Ratings said after an agreement

and spending against a weak economic backdrop if the budget
deficit and government debt is to be cut to safer levels over
the medium term, Fitch said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
