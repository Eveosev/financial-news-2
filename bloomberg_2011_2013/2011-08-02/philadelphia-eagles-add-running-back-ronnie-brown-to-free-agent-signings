Ronnie Brown joined the  Philadelphia
Eagles , adding a running back to a free-agency haul that has
made the National Football League team Super Bowl favorites.  Brown, 29, signed a one-year contract, the Eagles said in a
news release that didn’t disclose financial terms of the deal.  “He can run the ball, catch it and does very well in pass
protection,” Howie Roseman, the team’s general manager, said in
the news release. “He’ll add some good size to our backfield
and he’s a good character guy.”  The Eagles joined the Green Bay Packers and New England
Patriots as Super Bowl favorites with Las Vegas oddsmakers after
adding cornerback Nnamdi Asomugha, defensive tackle Cullen Jenkins and defensive end Jason Babin in free agency. The team
also acquired cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie in a trade
that sent quarterback  Kevin Kolb  to the Arizona Cardinals.  Brown, a 2008 Pro Bowl selection, was chosen second overall
in the 2005 draft by the  Miami Dolphins , and gained 4,815 yards
and scored 36 touchdowns in six seasons with the team. He ranks
third on the Dolphins’ career rushing list, behind Larry Csonka
and Ricky Williams.  To contact the reporter on this story:
