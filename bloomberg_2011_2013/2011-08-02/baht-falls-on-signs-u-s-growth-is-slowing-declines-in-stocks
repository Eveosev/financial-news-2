Thailand ’s baht dropped as signs U.S.
economic growth is slowing reduced demand for higher-yielding
assets and worsened the outlook for regional exports.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of shares slumped the most in
three weeks after the  Institute for Supply Management  said
yesterday that an index of U.S. manufacturing eased to 50.9 last
month, the lowest since July 2009. The baht rose yesterday by
the most in a week as U.S. lawmakers forged an agreement to
raise the federal debt limit to avoid a default.  “Bad data came out when attention was shifted from the
debt-ceiling agreement to concern about the U.S. economic
slowdown,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a global economist at Mizuho
Securities Co. in  Tokyo . “And stocks also dropped amid  risk
aversion , also weighing on regional currencies.”  The baht weakened 0.2 percent to 29.76 per dollar as of
3:47 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency may trade in a range of 29.60 to 29.85 this week,
Hayashi said.  The U.S. is Thailand’s third-largest export market, buying
9.4 percent of total shipments in the first quarter of this year,
according to official data. Overseas shipments, which account
for about two-thirds of Southeast Asia’s second-biggest economy,
increased 16.4 percent in June from a year earlier, the least
since a contraction of 2.5 percent in October 2009, according to
central bank data last week.  Government bonds  rose for a fourth day. The yield on the
5.25 percent notes due May 2014 dropped three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 3.72 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The one-year onshore interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, was little changed at 3.65
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
