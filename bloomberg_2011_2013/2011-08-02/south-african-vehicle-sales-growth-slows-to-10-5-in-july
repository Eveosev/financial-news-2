South African vehicle sales rose at a
slower pace in July than the month before as unemployment
increased and economic growth eased in  Africa ’s largest economy.  Sales gained 10.5 percent to 45,703 vehicles from the same
month a year earlier, after rising 12.6 percent in June, the
National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of  South Africa 
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Demand for new vehicles decreased as the  unemployment rate ,
the highest of 61 countries tracked by Bloomberg, rose to 25.7
percent in the second quarter, from 25 percent in the prior
three months. Manufacturing, which makes up 15 percent of the
economy, grew 0.6 percent in May from the year earlier, while
retail sales were unchanged in the same period, indicating a
slowdown in economic growth, according to the government
statistics agency.  “There were clear signs of slower underlying momentum in
demand for new cars,” Naamsa said. “Subdued growth in private
sector credit extension and in  money supply , sharply higher than
inflation administered-price increases, notably electricity and
rising fuel costs,” are likely to negatively affect consumer
demand going forward.  Passenger car sales rose 9.7 percent from a year ago to
30,030 in July, while purchases of light commercial vehicles,
such as pick-up trucks and minivans, climbed 10.2 percent to
11,420, Naamsa said.  Exports rose 8.1 percent to 25,147 in July.  “Whilst the momentum of new vehicle exports remained
positive, the July export numbers had been adversely affected by
the fact that various automotive plants had lost a few days of
production during the month as a result of widespread strike
action in the steel and engineering” industries, Naamsa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
