Mexico ’s peso dropped the most in
three weeks as consumer spending in the U.S., the nation’s
largest trading partner, unexpectedly declined for the first
time in almost two years.  The peso dropped 1.1 percent to 11.8458 per  U.S. dollar  at
5 p.m. New York time, from 11.7199 yesterday. The decline was
the biggest since July 11 and pared the currency’s gain against
the dollar this year to 4.2 percent, the third-best performer
among the six major Latin American currencies tracked by
Bloomberg, after  Colombia ’s peso and  Brazil ’s real.  “The data continues to be pessimistic,” said Omar Martin del Campo, the head trader at Banco Ve Por Mas SA in Mexico
City. “The economy really doesn’t have the strength to get
ahead of its problems.”  U.S.  consumer spending  dropped 0.2 percent in June after
rising 0.1 percent the month before, Commerce Department figures
showed today. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey was for
a gain of 0.1 percent. Incomes expanded at the slowest pace
since November and the savings rate rose. The U.S. purchases
about 80 percent of Mexico’s exports.  The yield on Mexico’s peso debt due in 2024 declined five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 6.58 percent, the
lowest since Nov. 11, according to Banco Santander SA. The price
of the security rose 0.52 centavo to 130.34 centavos per peso.  Mexico sold all 5.5 billion pesos of the 28-day Cetes it
offered at auction today, the central bank said in an e-mailed
statement. The government sold 6.5 billion pesos of 91-day Cetes
and 7 billion pesos of 175-day Cetes, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
