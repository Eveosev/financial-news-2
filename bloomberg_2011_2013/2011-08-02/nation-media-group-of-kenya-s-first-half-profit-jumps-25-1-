Nation Media Group Ltd. (NMG) , East
Africa’s largest publishing company, posted a 25 percent jump in
first-half profit as sales increased.  Net income for the six-month period rose to 747 million
shillings ($8.2 million) as sales climbed 17 percent to 5.2
billion shillings, Chief Executive Officer Linus Gitahi told
reporters today in the capital, Nairobi.  A rising inflation rate, weakening local currency, drought
and high energy costs pose “considerable economic risks” for the
rest of this year, Gitahi said.  “We remain cautiously optimistic for the remainder of the
year even as we pursue new market opportunities,” he said.
Nation Media plans open a radio station in  Rwanda  by the end of
the year and start operations in South Sudan, Gitani said,
without giving a timeframe.  The company’s stock dropped 1 shilling, the most in a week,
to 150 shillings by the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi,  To contact the reporter on this story:
