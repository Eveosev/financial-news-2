Tour de France  winner  Cadel Evans 
extended his contract with the BMC Racing Team through 2014.  Evans, a 34-year-old Australian, joined BMC at the end of
2009 and helped the U.S.-based rookie team secure berths in the
Tour de France and Giro d’Italia last year. He became the first
Southern Hemisphere champion in cycling’s most prestigious race
last week.  The victory lifted Evans atop the  Union Cycliste
Internationale ’s World Tour rankings and pulled BMC into second
place in the team standings behind Leopard Trek, which has
Luxembourg brothers Andy and Frank Schleck on its roster.  “As a team we have grown successfully together,” Evans
said in a statement on BMC’s website. “From the start, I have
always felt the BMC Racing Team has had a lot of confidence in
me as a member and often as a leader of the team. So a longer
term contract echoes this.”  Three-time U.S. national road champion George Hincapie,
Evans’s wingman at the Tour de  France , re-signed through 2012,
BMC said. The 2012 season will be Hincapie’s 18th since turning
professional in 1994.  To contact the reporter on this story:
