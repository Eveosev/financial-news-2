Hotel foreclosures in  California 
jumped 91 percent in the second quarter as lenders repossessed
properties to sell them amid a recovery in property prices,
 Atlas Hospitality Group  said today.  The number of foreclosed hotels climbed to 191 in the three
months ended June 30 from 100 a year earlier, according to the
Irvine, California-based brokerage. Seizures also rose from the
first quarter, when lenders took over 148 California hotels. The
state’s biggest hotel foreclosure in the second quarter was the
331-room Hilton Sacramento Arden West, Atlas said.  The average U.S. hotel purchase price climbed to $192,479 a
room in the second quarter, up more than 25 percent from 2006,
during the property boom, according to Real Capital Analytics
Inc. Values are being driven up this year by a surge in luxury-
hotel transactions, the New York-based research company said.  “The rise in foreclosures can be largely attributed to
lenders now having the financial reserves to be able to
foreclose and sell the properties at today’s market values,”
Atlas President Alan Reay said in a statement. The hotels being
repossessed have been “in trouble for a long time and lenders
were delaying taking any action,” he said in an interview.  San Bernardino and Riverside led the state in hotel
foreclosures with 21 properties repossessed in each county,
followed by  Los Angeles  with 16, Atlas said. The number of
California hotels in default is down 24 percent from 2010’s
second quarter, according to the hotel brokerage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
