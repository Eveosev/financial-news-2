Marathon Petroleum Corp., the crude
refiner that was spun off from its corporate parent on June 30,
said buying BP Plc’s Texas City plant “is not high on our
priority list.”  Marathon is focused on buying gasoline stations and
investing in its logistics business as a growth strategy, Garry Peiffer, executive vice president of corporate planning and
investor and government relations, said in a telephone interview
today.  “We’ve got a pretty good growth profile with what we did
already,” said Peiffer. “It would have to be something very
attractive to entice us to do something now.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
