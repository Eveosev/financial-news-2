Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO) , the U.S. energy
producer that spun off its refining business in June, said
second-quarter profit fell amid unplanned production
disruptions.  Excluding its former fuel-making segment, the company
earned $298 million, or 42 cents a share, from continuing
operations, Houston-based Marathon Oil said in a statement
distributed by  Thomson Reuters  today. Marathon Oilâ€™s profit was
$374 million, or 53 cents a share, a year earlier, excluding the
refining unit.  Marathon Oil completed the spinoff of its refining and
marketing business, Marathon Petroleum Corp., on June 30. The
oil and natural-gas producer is expanding in the U.S.,
announcing on June 1 that it planned to buy Eagle Ford shale
assets in  Texas  for about $3.5 billion.  Oil futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
averaged $102.34 a barrel in the second quarter, a 31 percent
increase from $78.05 a barrel a year earlier. Average gas prices
rose less than 3 cents to $4.378 per million British thermal
units.  The earnings statement was issued before the opening of
regular trading on U.S. stock markets. Marathon Oil fell 33
cents, or 1.1 percent, to $30.64 yesterday in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.  (Marathon is scheduled to hold an investor conference call
at 2:30 p.m. New York time, accessible at
