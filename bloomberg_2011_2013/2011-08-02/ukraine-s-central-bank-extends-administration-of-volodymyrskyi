Ukraine’s central bank extended its
temporary management of lender PAT KB Volodymyrskyi for a month.  The  Natsionalnyi Bank Ukrainy  decided July 29 to prolong
its administration of Volodymyrskyi until the end of August,
according to a statement on the Kiev-based central bank’s
website. Serhiy Bereza will continue to manage Volodymyrskyi.  The central bank resumed its management of Volodymyrskyi in
January to “restore financial stability” six months after
suspending administration of the lender. Volodymyrskyi was
initially put under central bank management in July 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
