Angola  is working with LR Group Ltd.
of  Israel  to help boost border security in the diamond-rich
northeastern Lunda Norte province, said Ernesto Muangala, the
region’s governor.  Officials are struggling to protect the 770-kilometer (478-
mile) land border and 120-kilometer river border with the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Muangala said in an interview
yesterday in Luanda, the capital.  “The government has prioritized an increase in the number
of border police and is acquiring and installing modern
equipment for border control,” Muangala said.  The southern African nation is trying to contain the inflow
of illegal immigrants from Congo who come to search for gems in
Lunda Norte. The government expelled more than 69,000 immigrants
in 2009, according to Angola’s Foreign Service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
