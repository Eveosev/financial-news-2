Washington  Redskins cornerback
Phillip Buchanon will sit out the team’s first four regular-
season games while serving a suspension handed down by the
 National Football League , coach Mike Shanahan said.  Shanahan, speaking to reporters today at the Redskins’
training facility and shown on the team’s website, didn’t
disclose specifics about the suspension.  “It’s a little setback for us,”  said Shanahan , who added
that the discipline came “a while back” from the league office.  Shanahan also said quarterback Rex Grossman would likely
come to terms on a contract to rejoin the Redskins after
starting the team’s final three games last season.  Buchanon said yesterday on his  Twitter feed  that he would
be re-signing with the Redskins. He started five games for the
team last season, when he was used mostly as a third cornerback
and had two interceptions.  Buchanon, 30, has 20 interceptions over nine NFL seasons
with Washington,  Detroit ,  Tampa Bay , Houston and Oakland.  Grossman, 30, will report to the Redskins’ camp later today
and may compete with John Beck and Kellen Clemens for the
starting quarterback job. He passed for 884 yards with seven
touchdowns and four interceptions last season.  “He knows the playbook, he’s got a good feel for the
system and now he gets a chance to compete,” Shanahan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
