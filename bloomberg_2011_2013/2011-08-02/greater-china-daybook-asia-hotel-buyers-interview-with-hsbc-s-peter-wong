High-end hotels in large U.S. cities
are attracting buyers from  Hong Kong ,  China  and  Singapore 
seeking to cater to a growing number of affluent Asians
traveling abroad.  Acquisitions by Asian investors probably will climb to the
“low double digits” of all U.S. hotel deals this year, said
John Strauss, a managing director for investment sales at Jones
Lang LaSalle Hotels in  Los Angeles . They accounted for about 8
percent in 2010, according to the brokerage. The most recent
deal came last week, when the family of Hong Kong billionaire
Cheng Yu-Tung purchased five luxury properties, including
 Manhattan ’s Carlyle, for $570 million.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
