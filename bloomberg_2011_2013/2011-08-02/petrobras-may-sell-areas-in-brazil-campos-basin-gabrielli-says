Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , the Brazilian
state-controlled  oil company , may sell exploration areas in the
country’s most prolific oil producing region as part of a plan
to raise $13.6 billion from the sale of assets and cost savings.  Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based company is known,
will consider selling “isolated blocks” in the southeastern
Campos Basin that aren’t a priority for it to develop, Chief
Executive Officer Jose Sergio Gabrielli said in New York today.  Petrobras may divest stakes in Brazilian companies and
exploration blocks as it seeks to pay for a $224.7 billion
investment plan, the world’s largest oil industry spending
program. The company is focusing on  oil fields  in Campos that
are near existing platforms to minimize development costs,
according to the company’s 2011-2015 business plan.  “Some of our blocks in the Campos Basin, that are isolated
blocks, that are not the most priority things for us, we may
consider selling as part of our divestment project,” Gabrielli
told reporters.  The stock fell 25 centavos, or 1.1 percent, to 23.25 reais
as of 1:13 p.m. in Sao Paulo trading and has declined 15 percent
this year, compared with a 17 percent drop for the benchmark
Bovespa Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
