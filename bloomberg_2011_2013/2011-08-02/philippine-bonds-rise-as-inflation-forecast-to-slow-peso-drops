Philippine bonds rose before a report
this week that economists predict will show inflation eased last
month. The peso retreated from a three-year high.  Benchmark six-year yields fell for a second day after
central bank Governor Amando Tetangco said yesterday consumer
price-gains will be within the 3 percent to 5 percent target
range for this year and next. Inflation cooled to 4.9 percent in
July from 5.2 percent the previous month, according to the
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before
data due Aug. 5.  “Bonds are being supported because price pressures seem to
be going down,” said Roland Avante, treasurer at Sterling Bank
of  Asia  in  Manila . “Another rate hike may not happen anytime
soon.”  The yield on the 7 percent bond due March 2017 slid five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 4.95 percent as of
5:03 p.m. in Manila, according to ICAP Plc.  The peso weakened 0.5 percent to 42.15 per dollar,
according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency reached 41.903
yesterday, the highest level since April 2008.  To contact the reporter for this story:
