OAO Cherkizovo Group headed for its
highest close in almost four months after the Russian meat
producer said poultry sales climbed 18 percent by volume in the
first half to 117,900 metric tons.  The companyâ€™s shares traded 1.5 percent higher at 816.3
rubles by 11:48 a.m. in Moscow, headed for the highest close
since April 7.  Pork output was little changed from the same period last
year at 41,070 tons of live weight, while meat processing gained
6 percent to 70,097 tons, Cherkizovo said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
