Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) , the world’s biggest maker
of mobile phones by volume, had its debt rating lowered by
 Standard & Poor’s , which cited the Finnish company’s losses in
smartphone market share as it switches to  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s
Windows Phone software.  The long-term debt rating was reduced by one step to BBB,
two steps above junk, with a negative outlook, Standard & Poor’s
said today. The ranking is equivalent to Baa2 by Moody’s
Investors Service, which slashed its rating by two steps to that
level last week.  The cut reflects “the continued erosion of Nokia’s
smartphone market shares and a downward revision of our base-
case assessment for the operating margins of the devices &
services segment until Nokia has completed the adoption of
Windows Phone,” Matthias Raab, an S&P analyst, wrote in the
report.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and Samsung Electronics Co. both surpassed
Espoo, Finland-based Nokia in smartphone shipments for the first
time last quarter, according to analysts at  Strategy Analytics .
Apple added 5 percentage points for a share of 18.5 percent of
global smartphone shipments, while Samsung’s share more than
tripled to 17.5 percent from the second quarter of last year.  Nokia dropped to third place, as its share shrank to 15.2
percent from 38.1 percent, the analysts said last week. Nokia
remains the biggest handset producer overall, even though its
market share has fallen to the lowest level since 1999, Strategy
Analytics said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
