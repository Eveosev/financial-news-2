Indian stocks fell to a one-week low

increases will be needed to tackle inflation, fanning investor

percent. Infosys Ltd., the second-largest software services
provider, fell 2.2 percent.  State Bank of India (SBIN)  Ltd., the
biggest lender, sank 2.8 percent. Asian and European stocks
retreated amid concern that a slowdown in the world’s largest
economy is derailing global growth.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost
213.26, or 1.2 percent, to 18,101.07, according to preliminary
closing prices at 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai. The S&P CNX Nifty Index
