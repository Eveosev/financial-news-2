Village Main Reef Ltd., led by former
Harmony Gold Mining Co. chief Bernard Swanepoel, may sell its
Lesego platinum and Weltevreden gold projects in  South Africa  in
the next year.  “We want to bring in the strategic investors, probably in
the next 12 months or so,” or find a partner in Lesego,
Swanepoel, the chief executive officer, said in Johannesburg,
where the company is based.  Swanepoel set up Village with the “high-risk strategy” of
acquiring relatively cheap mining assets to add value and sell
on, he said. The estimated $1 billion cost to build a mine on
the Lesego deposit is too large for Village, and the company
doesn’t want to build mines, he said.  While Village has had “very early stage” interest in
Lesego, it wasn’t from suitable buyers, he said. Lesego will
probably give an update on the platinum content of the deposit
later this month, he said.  Village is reorganizing Buffelsfontein gold mine, “the
ultimate loss-making gold mine in South Africa,” acquired this
year, Swanepoel said. It is making “decent money” from the
antimony mine it took over from  Metorex Ltd. (MTX) , he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
