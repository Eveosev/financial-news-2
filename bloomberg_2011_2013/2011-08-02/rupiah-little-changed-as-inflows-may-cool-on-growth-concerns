Indonesia ’s rupiah retreated from its
strongest level in seven years as appetite for the nation’s
higher-yielding assets was countered by concern the U.S. and
China economies are slowing.  A report from the U.S. Institute for Supply Management
showed yesterday that growth in manufacturing slowed to the
least since July 2009, while separate data from HSBC Holdings
Plc and Markit Economics showed factory output in China
contracted. Indonesia’s benchmark interest rate is 6.75 percent
compared with as low as zero in the U.S. and 1.5 percent in the
euro area, helping drive this year’s 5.9 percent rally in the
rupiah. Ten-year  government bonds  advanced for a sixth day.  “There’s a bit of concern about the global slowdown,”
said Saktiandi Supaat, head of foreign-exchange research at
Malayan Banking Bhd. in  Singapore . “The rupiah is well-
supported. There has been a lot of interest in high-yield
currencies.”  The rupiah weakened 0.3 percent to 8,483 per dollar as of
4:28 p.m. in Jakarta, after yesterday climbing 0.5 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 8,453
earlier, the strongest level since March 2004. The rupiah may
advance to 8,400 by year-end, Supaat forecast.  Overseas  holdings  of local-currency government bonds
increased 26 percent this year to 247.51 trillion rupiah ($29.2
billion) as of July 28, figures from the finance ministry show.
Funds based abroad bought $2.7 billion more Indonesian shares
than they sold this year, according to stock exchange data.  Cooling Inflation  The ISM’s factory index slumped to 50.9 in July, from 55.3
a month earlier, the Tempe, Arizona-based group said. Figures
less than 50 signal contraction, and the July index was lower
than the most pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  China ’s Purchasing Managers’ Index was 49.3 in July versus
50.1 in June, HSBC Holdings and Markit Economics said yesterday.  The yield on Indonesia’s 8.25 percent notes due July 2021
declined six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 6.91
percent, the lowest since the debt was issued, according to
closing prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association.  Inflation in  Southeast Asia ’s largest economy slowed for
six straight months through July. Consumer prices rose 4.6
percent from a year earlier, compared with an increase of 5.5
percent the previous month, the  Central Bureau of Statistics 
said in Jakarta yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
