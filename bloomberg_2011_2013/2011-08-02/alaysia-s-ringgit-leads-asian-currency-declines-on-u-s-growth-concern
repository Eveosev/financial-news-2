Asian currencies weakened, led by
 Malaysia ’s ringgit and the Philippine peso, on concern a slowing
U.S. economy will hurt the global recovery and damp demand for
the region’s exports.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of stocks fell by the most in
three weeks after data showed yesterday that manufacturing in
the world’s largest economy dropped to a two-year low in July.
Malaysia’s trade ministry will report on Aug. 4 that overseas
shipments rose 5.8 percent in June from a year earlier, compared
with an average increase of 8.2 percent in the previous 12
months, according to the median forecast of economists in a
Bloomberg survey.  “Weak data out of the U.S. is capping the upside of
regional currencies in the short term,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a
global economist at Mizuho Securities Co. in  Tokyo . “And stocks
dropped, making risk sentiment weak.”  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-traded currencies excluding the yen, fell 0.2
percent to 119.91 as of 4:31 p.m. in  Hong Kong . The ringgit
slumped 0.6 percent to 2.9565 per dollar and the peso lost 0.5
percent to 42.15, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
 Singapore  dollar and India’s rupee slid 0.4 percent to S$1.2048
and 44.255, respectively.  Manufacturing Index  The U.S. Institute for Supply Management’s factory index
slumped to 50.9 in July from 55.3 a month earlier. Figures lower
than 50 signal contraction. Reports today will show personal
income and spending in the U.S. stagnated in June, according to
median forecasts in Bloomberg News surveys. The U.S. is the
second-largest export market for  Taiwan  and  South Korea , and the
third-largest for Thailand.  The ringgit retreated from near a 14-year high as the
prospect of moderating exports prompted Credit Suisse Group AG
to lower its 2011 economic growth forecast for Malaysia to 5.3
percent from 5.6 percent, according to an Aug. 1 research note.  “There’s a bit of concern about the downside risk to
growth with the latest economic reports,” said Saktiandi Supaat,
head of foreign-exchange research at Malayan Banking Bhd. in
Singapore. “This could delay further policy tightening” in the
region, he said.  South Korea’s won was little changed near a three-year high
after Internet news provider Edaily reported yesterday that the
government is looking at ways to regulate foreign funds’
“excessive” investment in won-denominated bonds and wants to
curb growth in banks’ short-term debt, citing an unidentified
finance ministry official. The currency traded at 1,050.75 per
dollar. It touched 1,048.30 on July 27, the strongest level
since August 2008.  Elsewhere,  Thailand ’s baht and Indonesia’s rupiah fell 0.2
percent against the dollar to 29.76 and 8,474, respectively. The
Taiwan dollar weakened 0.2 percent to NT$28.880, while  China ’s
yuan declined 0.07 percent to 6.4382, the sharpest drop in two
weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
