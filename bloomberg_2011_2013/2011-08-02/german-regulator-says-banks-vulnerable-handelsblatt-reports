German banks may still be harmed by
the sovereign debt crisis even if they passed European stress
tests,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing Raimund Roeseler, executive
director of BaFin, the country’s financial regulator.  Roeseler said the default of a single euro-area country
would be “very painful” for German banks, though it still
could be dealt with, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
