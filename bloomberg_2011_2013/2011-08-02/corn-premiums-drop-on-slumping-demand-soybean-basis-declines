Cash premiums for U.S. corn shipped
in August to export terminals near  New Orleans  fell relative to
Chicago futures amid waning demand. The soybean basis also
weakened.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered this
month was 79 cents to 83 cents a bushel above September futures,
compared with 82 cents to 83 cents yesterday, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. The soybean premium fell to 60 cents to
77 cents a bushel above August futures from 66 cents to 77
cents.  “Demand out there is a little tight,”  Shawn McCambridge ,
the senior grain analyst at Jeffries Bache LLC in Chicago, said
by telephone. “The strong move in the futures market is going
to pressure the basis levels.”  Corn futures for September delivery jumped by the exchange
limit of 30 cents, or 4.4 percent, to $7.1125 a bushel on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade, the largest gain for the contract since
April 29.  Soybean futures for August delivery gained 14.25 cents, or
1 percent, to $13.73 a bushel on the CBOT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
