Marathon Petroleum Corp., the crude
refiner that was spun off from its corporate parent on June 30,
said second-quarter profit increased as the profit margin
between oil costs and fuel prices doubled.  Net income rose to $802 million, or $2.24 a share, from
$405 million, or $1.13, a year earlier, Findlay, Ohio-based
Marathon Petroleum said in a statement today issued by  Thomson
Reuters . The company was expected to earn $1.81 a share,
according to the average of four analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  “In the second quarter there was definitely a recovery
across all regions in the refining industry,” Sam Margolin, a
New York-based analyst at Dahlman Rose & Co. who rates the
shares a “buy” and doesn’t own any, said in an interview
before the earnings were released. “That strength is reflected
in Marathon’s earnings.”  Standard & Poor’s  index of independent U.S. refiners has
gained 23 percent this year. The crack spread, a measure of the
difference between the cost of crude and the price at which
refiners can sell fuel, averaged $26.625 a barrel for the
quarter, more than double the $12.258 average of a year earlier,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The spread topped $35 a
barrel on July 11, the highest level in at least 25 years.  Marathon Petroleum is the largest independent U.S. refiner
by market value. It has six refineries with a combined capacity
of 1.14 million barrels of crude per day, according to Bloomberg
data. The company owns more than 1,300 retail stations and moves
crude through 9,600 miles (15,400 kilometers) of pipelines that
run from the  Gulf Coast  to the Midwest, according to its
website.  The earnings statement was released before the start of
regular trading in U.S. markets. Marathon Petroleum rose $1.18,
or 2.7 percent, to $44.97 yesterday in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The shares, which have gained 9.2 percent
since their first day of trading July 1, have 12 buy ratings
from analysts and two holds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
