The unions of Transgaz SA,  Romania ’s
state-owned natural-gas transmission operator, filed a lawsuit
against the company, demanding 10 percent of the 2010 profit for
the employees, the company said in a statement to the Bucharest
Stock Exchange.  The unions are asking for the annulment of a general
shareholders meeting on June 10, when the company approved a
dividend payment of 339 million lei ($114 million), representing
90 percent of last year’s profit. Transgaz employees have the
right to receive a percentage from the company’s profit,
according to the collective labor agreement, the unions said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
