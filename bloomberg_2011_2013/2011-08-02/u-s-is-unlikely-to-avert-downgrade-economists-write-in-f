The agreement reached in the U.S.’s
fiscal confrontation doesn’t overcome the country’s long-term
difficulties, so the rating companies are right to look again at
America’s triple-A credit rating, said economists  Carmen Reinhart  and  Vincent Reinhart .  Writing in the Financial Times, they said most of the
spending cuts are to be decided later, and they depend on the
untried mechanisms of a new committee.  The rating companies have identified two vulnerabilities
that might cause them to downgrade and the agreement does little
to tackle either, they said.  The first is a widespread desire to cut debt levels, which
resulted from the financial crisis of 2007-09 and is causing a
lacklustre economic performance; that is what one should expect
from history, which shows that economies grow more slowly and
unemployment stays high in the decade after an economic crisis,
the two economists said.  The second is that almost half of  Treasury securities  are
in the hands of foreigners, who may have growing doubts about
the U.S. role in global markets, they said.  If Republicans could accept that the average  tax rate  has
to rise, Democrats might concede that raising marginal tax rates
in the existing system isn’t the best course; the likelihood is,
however, that the stalemate will return, so the threat of a debt
downgrade remains real, they concluded.  Carmen Reinhart is at the Peterson Institute for
International Economics and Vincent Reinhart is at the  American
Enterprise Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
