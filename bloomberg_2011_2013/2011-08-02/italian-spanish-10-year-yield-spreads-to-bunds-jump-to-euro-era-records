Italian and Spanish 10-year bonds
fell, sending the yield on Italyâ€™s securities to the most since
1997 and pushing the additional yield investors demand to hold
the securities instead of German bunds to euro-era records.  The yield on 10-year Italian bonds jumped 12 basis points
to 6.12 percent as of 7:39 a.m. in London, the most since
November 1997. That increased the difference in yield, or
spread, to bunds, to 368 basis points, the most since before the
euro was introduced in 1999.  The yield premium investors demand for Spanish 10-year
bonds instead of similar-maturity German debt rose 10 basis
points to 384 basis points and the yield spread between 10-year
Belgian debt and bunds widened four basis points to 196 basis
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
