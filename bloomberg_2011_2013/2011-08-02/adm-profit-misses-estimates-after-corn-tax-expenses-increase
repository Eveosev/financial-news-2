Archer Daniels Midland Co., the
world’s largest grain processor, reported an unexpected 15
percent drop in fiscal fourth-quarter profit after tax expenses
rose and corn prices advanced.  Net income was $381 million, or 58 cents a share, in the
three months ended June 30, compared with $446 million, or 69
cents a share, a year earlier, the Decatur, Illinois-based
company said today in a statement. That missed the 85-cent
average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales
increased 46 percent to $22.9 billion from $15.7 billion.  ADM, led by Chief Executive Officer Patricia Woertz, saw
its effective  tax rate  climb to 50 percent in the quarter from
19 percent. That was caused by the stronger Brazilian real and
more earnings coming from the U.S., Chief Financial Officer Ray Young said on a conference call. Corn-processing operating
profit fell 16 percent to $118 million. Corn futures in Chicago
have gained 69 percent over the last year.  “We think the most significant miss in the business
segments was in corn,” Ann Gurkin, a Richmond, Virginia-based
analyst for Davenport & Co. who has a “buy” rating on the
shares, said in an interview. “The tax rate was a surprise. The
stock is going to be under pressure.”  ADM dropped $1.21, or 4 percent, to $29.27 as of 10:01 a.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  Tax Forecast  Agricultural services, ADM’s biggest business segment by
revenue in the last fiscal full year, saw operating profit up
8.4 percent to $193 million. The unit buys, sells and transports
commodities. Oilseed processing, the second-largest unit, saw
operating profit rise 5.6 percent to $379 million.  Earnings before income taxes included an inventory credit
of $52 million, or 5 cents a share, compared with a charge of
$23 million, or 2 cents a share, a year earlier, the company
said.  ADM forecast an effective tax rate of 28 to 30 percent for
the 2012 fiscal year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
