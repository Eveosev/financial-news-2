Polish stocks headed for the lowest
close in two weeks and the zloty retreated the most in a week as
reports signaling that the global recovery is stalling curbed
demand for emerging-market assets.  The WIG20 Index of stocks fell 0.8 percent to 2,679.47 as
of 4:55 p.m. in Warsaw, led by PKO Bank Polski SA, the country’s
largest lender. The zloty depreciated 0.6 percent to 4.0203 per
euro and declined to as low as 3.6586 against the Swiss franc,
the weakest since at least 1998.  Investors sought the safety of the Swiss currency after
U.S. lawmakers approved legislation to raise the debt limit, a
day before a possible default. A report today showed  consumer
spending  unexpectedly dropped in June for the first time in
almost two years after data yesterday showed a gauge of
manufacturing weakened to a two-year low.  “Market attention appears to have passed from relief about
a U.S. debt ceiling deal to renewed concerns about the economic
outlook,” RBC Capital strategists including  Nigel Rendell  in
 London  wrote in a note to clients.  PKO Bank Polski declined 1.9 percent to 40.21 percent,
poised to close at a two-week low.  Getin Holding SA (GTN) , the
financial services group controlled by billionaire Leszek
Czarnecki, slid 6.1 percent to 10.25 zloty, the lowest intraday
level since Oct. 19. The total value of franc-denominated home
loans in  Poland  reached 149.7 billion zloty ($52 billion) at the
end of May and represented 53 percent of all mortgages
outstanding, according to the financial market regulator’s
 website.   To contact the reporter on this story:
