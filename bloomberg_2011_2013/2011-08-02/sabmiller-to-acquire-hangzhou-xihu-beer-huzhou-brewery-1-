SABMiller Plc (SAB)  said China Resources
Snow Breweries Ltd., its joint venture in the Asian nation, has
agreed to acquire the remaining equity in Hangzhou Xihu
Breweries Asahi Co. Ltd. and Xihu Breweries Asahi Co. Ltd. for
about $47 million in cash.  SABMiller’s joint venture with China Resources Snow
Breweries will pay the sum to Asahi Breweries Itochu Ltd. for
the remaining 55 percent equity in Hangzhou Xihu Beer, and 25
percent equity in Huzhou Brewery, as the companies are known,
according to a statement today. Both companies will become
wholly owned subsidiaries of CR Snow.  The deal will build on London-based SABMiller’s presence in
the eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, where lager volumes
increased 7 percent in the 12 months through March 2011, the
company said. Snow, its main brand in  China , had a 21 percent
share of the market last year, making it the largest beer brand
in China by volume.  “This latest transaction increases our production capacity
to serve the thriving Zhejiang province,” Ari Mervis, managing
director of SABMiller Asia, said in the statement. “The
cumulative impact of our recent transactions across China
supports our confidence in this growing market with strong
prospects.”  SABMiller is the world’s second-largest beermaker by
volume.  To contact the reporter on this story:
