Brazil  is looking to cut its  trade 
deficit in manufactured goods by about 40 percent by 2014 as
part of President Dilma Rousseff’s industrial policy to combat
the effect of a strong currency and a surge in Chinese imports,
a government official said.  Rousseff’s policy, which will be presented today, aims to
help textile manufacturers and other industries hurt by the
real’s 48 percent rally since the end of 2008 and a flood of
Chinese-made goods during that time, said the official, who
asked not to be named because the policy hasn’t been made
public.  The policy also aims to boost the efficiency of Brazil’s
manufacturers by increasing investment levels from a current
18.4 percent of gross domestic product to 22 percent of GDP by
2014, the official said.  Rousseff will present the industrial policy, which is
expected to consist of tax breaks and other incentives, today at
an event in Brasilia.  Brazil’s real has rallied 48 percent since the end of 2008,
more than all 25 major emerging market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg, making the cost of the country’s goods more expensive
relative to trading partners.  As the real has rallied, imports from  China  have surged. In
the first seven months of the year, Chinese imports jumped 34
percent, more than all of Brazil’s trading partners except
Eastern Europe, to $17.7 billion from $13.1 billion in the first
seven months of 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
