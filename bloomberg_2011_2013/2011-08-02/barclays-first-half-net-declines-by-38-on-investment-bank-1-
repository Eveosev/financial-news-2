Barclays Plc (BARC) , Britain’s second-
largest bank by assets, said first-half earnings fell 38 percent
on declining investment banking revenue and on provisioning for
mis-sold mortgage insurance.  The lender’s net income for the six months to June 30 fell
to 1.5 billion pounds ($2.45 billion), down from 2.43 billion
pounds a year earlier, it said in a statement, beating the 1.29
billion-pound median estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  “While the performance of our capital markets business in
July has been impacted by current market conditions, our other
businesses have performed in aggregate ahead of their run rate
for the first six months of the year,” the company said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
