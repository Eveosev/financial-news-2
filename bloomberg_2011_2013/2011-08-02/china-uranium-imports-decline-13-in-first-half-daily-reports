China  imported 5,356 tons of uranium
in the first six months of 2011, a 13 percent decline from a
year earlier, the  China Daily  reported today, citing the General
Administration of Customs.  In the first half of 2010, China imported 6,065 tons of
uranium, 2.5 times the amount from the same period of 2009, the
newspaper reported. China tripled its annual uranium imports
last year as compared with 2009, according to the report.  The slowdown may be the result of uncertainty about the
nuclear power industry’s prospects ahead of the government’s
release of a revised development plans for the industry, the
newspaper reported, citing Xu Ying, an industry analyst at
Donghai Securities Co. China suspended approval of new nuclear
projects following the accident in  Japan ’s Fukushima in March,
according to the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
