Foreign investors bought a net 16.9
billion pounds ($27.6 billion) of U.K. government bonds in the
three months to June, according to the  Bank of England .  The purchase compared with net sales of 3.03 billion pounds
in the prior three months, when there were outflows in January
and March. Investors purchased a net 4.3 billion pounds in
April, 7.3 billion pounds in May, and 5.3 billion pounds in
June, the data on the central bank’s website showed. These
figures may be revised.  The amount of gilts held by overseas investors declined to
301.5 billion pounds in the first quarter of this year, from
309.2 billion pounds at the end of December, according to the
latest data available from the Debt Management Office. That’s
around 30 percent of total gilts outstanding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
