Wacker Chemie AG (WCH) , the second-biggest
producer of solar-grade silicon, fell the most in 2 1/2 years
after quarterly profit missed estimates.  Net income rose to 143 million euros ($202 million) in the
second quarter, Wacker said in a statement today. That compares
with the 152 million-euro mean estimate of seven analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The stock traded down 9.8 percent at
117.30 euros at 11:42 a.m. in  Frankfurt , the biggest drop since
December 2008.  Wacker is spending more on new production lines just as
capacity increases from Chinese rivals including GCL Poly Energy
Holdings crater the  spot market  for the material, known as
polysilicon. The price slumped 28 percent in June from the
previous month as demand from solar cell makers declined after
governments in  Germany  and  Italy  reined in subsidies.  Wacker, based in Munich, spent 208.3 million euros in the
quarter expanding plants at Nuenchritz, Germany, and Charleston,
 Tennessee . A new factory in Charleston with 15,000 tons-a-year
capacity will be completed by the end of 2013.  Polysilicon slipped a further 5.1 percent in July to $51.17
per kilo on average, according to an index by Bloomberg New
Energy Finance. Prices will continue to fall for the next 12
months, 52 percent of respondents in a BNEF survey said.  Wackerâ€™s gross margin narrowed to 27 percent from 31
percent in the previous quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
