Japan  hasn’t made a specific decision
on how it will conduct foreign-exchange policy, a government
official said after the Nikkei newspaper reported authorities
are preparing to sell the currency to stem its advance.  The government is in contact with overseas counterparts on
a regular basis, the official, who spoke to reporters on
condition of anonymity, told reporters in  Tokyo  today. The
person declined to comment on intervention.  The Nikkei report also said the BOJ may weigh easing
monetary policy at an Aug. 4-5 board meeting, without citing
where it obtained the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
