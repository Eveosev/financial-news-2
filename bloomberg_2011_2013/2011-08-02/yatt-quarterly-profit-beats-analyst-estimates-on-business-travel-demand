Hyatt Hotels Corp. (H) , the chain
controlled by the Pritzker family, reported second-quarter
earnings that beat analysts’ estimates, helped by increased
business travel and demand at its international locations.  Net income rose to $37 million, or 22 cents a share, from
$25 million, or 14 cents, a year earlier, the Chicago-based
company said today in a statement. The hotelier was expected to
earn 15 cents a share, the average estimate of 12 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  “Their exposure in larger cities, good international
results and demand from individual business travelers helped
them during the quarter,”  Patrick Scholes , an analyst at FBR
Capital Markets Corp., said in a telephone interview before
earnings were released.  Hyatt’s revenue rose to $936 million from $889 million a
year earlier. Revenue per available room, a measure of occupancy
and rates, for hotels owned or leased for at least a year
climbed 5 percent at full-service hotels in  North America  and
9.9 percent overseas.  To contact the reporters on this story:
