Taiwan ’s bonds advanced, pushing
benchmark five-year yields to a two-week low, as slowing U.S.
manufacturing growth deterred risk taking and boosted demand for
the relative safety of government debt.  The Taiex index of shares fell 1.3 percent after data
released yesterday showed the  Institute for Supply Management ’s
factory index dropped to 50.9 last month from 55.3 in June, the
lowest level in two years and less than the median estimate of
54.5 in a Bloomberg survey.  “Taiwan’s stocks are down a lot today because of the bad
U.S. data, which caused a flight-to-safety to  government
bonds ,” said  Albert Lee , a Taipei-based fixed-income trader at
Cathay United Bank Co. “Short sellers have been quite
aggressive on the five-year debt, and we’re seeing buybacks
today. Yields could go down further for the rest of the week.”  The yield on the 2 percent notes due July 2016, the most
traded government debt, dropped three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.173 percent as of the 1:30 p.m. close in
Taipei, prices from Gretai Securities Market show. The rate
touched 1.165 percent earlier, the lowest level since July 15.  The central bank plans to auction NT$100 billion ($3.5
billion) of 364-day certificates of deposit on Aug. 5, it said
in an e-mailed statement today.  Taiwan’s dollar weakened 0.2 percent to NT$28.880 against
its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. close, according to Taipei
Forex Inc. It reached NT$28.748 earlier, the strongest level
since July 11.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, declined one basis point to 0.381 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
