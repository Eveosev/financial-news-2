Greece  will halt payment of 20,000
pensions and benefits that were being wrongfully paid, which
will save 120 million euros ($170.8 million) a year, Labor
Minister George Koutroumanis told  Mega TV .  Greeceâ€™s biggest pension fund, IKA, will need an extra 200
million euros in funding by the end of the year to cover
payments, Koutroumanis told the Athens-based Mega today. The
ministry plans to cover the gap from cross checks to cut
incorrect distribution of funds, Mega said, citing Koutroumanis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
