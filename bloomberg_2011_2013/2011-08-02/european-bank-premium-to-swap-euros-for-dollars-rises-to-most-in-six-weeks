The premium European banks pay to
borrow in dollars through the swaps market jumped to the most in
six weeks.  The cost of converting euro-based payments into dollars, as
measured by the one-year cross-currency basis swap, fell to 38
basis points below the euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor,
the most since June 16. It was at 37.375 basis points as of 9:25
a.m. in  London , data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Basis swaps allow investors to borrow in one currency and
simultaneously lend in another.  The 10-year euro swap spread, which shows the difference
between the swap rate and the yield on benchmark German bunds
and is used as a measure of perceived risk, rose for a seventh
day, climbing to 68 basis points, the most since January 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
