Israel  may have its AAA credit rating
on U.S.-guaranteed sovereign bonds cut by Standard & Poor’s
Ratings Service in line with a similar action it has warned of
taking on  U.S. debt .  S&P put Israel’s rating on “CreditWatch” today, meaning
there is a 50 percent chance it may be cut in the next 90 days.
It said the action should have been taken July 14 when the U.S.
rating was placed on “CreditWatch,” attributing the lapse to an
administrative error.  The ratings service said it acted on the U.S. debt because
of an assessment that a substantial policy stalemate could last
beyond any near-term agreement to raise the U.S. debt ceiling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
