Mauritius’s rupee advanced for a
second day versus the euro amid investor concern that slowing
economic growth will worsen the sovereign-debt crisis in the
eurozone, the island nation’s biggest trading partner.  The rupee strengthened 0.7 percent to 39.6657 per euro as
of 3:22 p.m. in  Port Louis , the capital. The Mauritian currency
gained 0.4 percent to 27.95 per dollar.  The 17-nation European currency fell to the lowest level
against the dollar since July 21 after reports on manufacturing
yesterday suggested growth in the euro region is slowing.
Italian bonds fell, sending the yield on its 10-year securities
to the most since 1997 and pushing the additional yield
investors demand to hold the debt instead of benchmark German
bunds to euro era all-time highs.  “Growing concerns about global recovery have emerged
following a flurry of poor economic indicators, most notably
from the U.S. and China,” Mauritius Commercial Bank Ltd., the
island nation’s biggest lender, said in a research note
published on its website. Growth concerns drove the euro lower,
the note said.  Europe is the Indian Ocean island nation’s biggest buyer of
exports and largest source of visitors, according to the  Central
Statistics Office .  Mauritius’s 38-member SEMDEX index of stocks fell for the
first day in three, shedding 0.1 percent to 2,032.54 by the 1:30
p.m close, led by  Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB)  and  Ireland Blyth
Ltd. (IBL) , which has interests in agriculture and retail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
