(Corrects job title in first paragraph of story published
Aug. 2.)  Simon Newman, head of tanker research
at ICAP Shipping in  London , said there has been a 77 percent
drop in the number of supertankers used for storing crude oil
compared with two years earlier.  Six very large crude carriers, each capable of hauling 2
million barrels of oil, were used for floating storage by the
end of July this year, down from 26 in 2009, Newman said. The
number of VLCCs storing gasoil fell to zero from four, he said
today by e-mail.  On the demand for floating storage:  “Owners will no doubt be willing to store given the
current weak rates, but if the banks and traders can’t make
floating storage work” then owners don’t have the option of
using their vessels for the trade, he said, referring to rates
to hire the vessels.  On the glut of supertankers that has depressed hire rates:  “Six vessels out of the market won’t make much
difference.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
