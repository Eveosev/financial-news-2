Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields to an almost nine-month low, as bets inflation slowed
last month and a widening budget surplus boosted appetite for
the fixed-rate securities.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024 fell
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.6 percent at 2
p.m. New York time, according to the stock exchange. That’s its
lowest level on a closing basis since Nov. 17. The bond’s price
rose 0.135 centavo to 119.408 centavos per peso.  “Colombia’s fundamentals are strong with stable long-term
inflation and good fiscal numbers,” said Pedro Ospina, a bond
analyst at Interbolsa SA, the nation’s biggest brokerage.
“Given what’s happening in the U.S. and  Europe , emerging-market
bonds in fiscally-sound countries are a good investment
alternative.”  Colombia’s consumer prices rose 0.15 percent in July
compared with a 0.32 percent increase the previous month,
according to the median forecast of 24 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The national statistics agency is slated to publish
the monthly inflation report Aug. 5.  Colombia’s government said in a July 22 report that its
first-quarter consolidated  budget surplus  widened to 1 percent
of gross domestic product from 0.1 percent of GDP a year
earlier.  The peso erased an earlier gain and declined 0.2 percent to
1,770.88 per dollar, from 1,768 yesterday. The peso has risen
7.7 percent so far this year, the best performance among the six
most-traded Latin American currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
