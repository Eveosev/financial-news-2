(Corrects to remove reference to first-ever default.)  President  Barack Obama  signed a bill
to raise the U.S. debt limit by at least $2.1 trillion, averting
by hours a default by the government.  The president signed the measure at the White House after
the Senate approved it today, ending weeks of partisan battles
over raising the debt ceiling. The House passed it yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
