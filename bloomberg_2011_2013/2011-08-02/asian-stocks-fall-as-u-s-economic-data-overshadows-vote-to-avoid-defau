Asian stocks fell the most in three
weeks after a report showing the slowest U.S. manufacturing
growth in two years soured the earnings outlook for Asian
exporters. The drop wiped out yesterday’s gains that attended a
deal among U.S. lawmakers to raise the country’s debt limit to
avoid default.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s No. 1 mining company, sank
1.7 percent in Sydney as the U.S. report added to evidence a
recovery in the biggest economy may be faltering. Samsung
Electronics Co., the South Korean television maker that reports
“America” is its second-largest market for sales, fell 2.1
percent in  Seoul . Cosco Corp. Singapore Ltd. sank 14 percent
after the shipbuilding unit of the Chinese shipping company
reported a 53 percent drop in profit.  “The passing of the U.S. debt-ceiling bill is obviously
good news, but the economic momentum in the U.S. has clearly
slowed,” said  Stephen Halmarick , the Sydney-based head of
investment markets research at Colonial First State Global Asset
Management, which oversees about $150 billion. “When stock
market investors focus on the economic data they may well be
disappointed.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 1.7 percent, the most
since July 12, to 136.55 as of 7:43 p.m. in  Tokyo , reversing
yesterday’s 1.6 percent advance. Almost four times as many
stocks declined as advanced on the gauge, which slumped 1.6
percent last week on concern the U.S. Congress would be unable
to reach an agreement to raise the nation’s debt ceiling before
today’s deadline.  All 10 industry groups represented on the MSCI Asia Pacific
gauge fell today. Declines deepened after a magnitude 4.3
temblor shook buildings in the Japanese capital.  U.S. Equities  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average slid 1.2 percent.  Hong
Kong ’s Hang Seng Index fell 1.1 percent and South Korea’s Kospi
index declined 2.4 percent, the biggest drop among the region’s
benchmark indexes. China’s Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.9
percent as investors speculated that the nation’s central bank
will raise interest rates this month to tame inflation.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index declined 1.4 percent as a
report showed the number of home-building approvals unexpectedly
declined in June, and after the central bank kept the benchmark
 interest rate  unchanged today, citing a clouded global economic
outlook.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
dropped to a one-week low after the central bank Governor
Duvvuri Subbarao said further rate increases will be necessary
to tame inflation, fanning investor concern corporate earnings
growth will slow.  Indian Stock Slump  The Sensex lost 1.1 percent at the close in Mumbai. The
gauge has declined 12 percent this year, the second-worst
performer after  Brazil ’s Bovespa among major indexes in the 10
biggest markets as the  Reserve Bank  of  India  boosted borrowing
costs 11 times since the start of 2010 to tame inflation.  In  New York  yesterday, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost
0.4 percent as the slower-than-forecast growth in manufacturing
erased a rally triggered by speculation lawmakers would raise
the federal debt ceiling.  Futures on the S&P 500 index slid 0.4 percent today,
reversing earlier gains, indicating the U.S. benchmark may open
lower for a seventh straight day. That would be the gauge’s
longest losing streak since October 2008, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The futures suggest U.S. stocks will fall at the open even
after the House of Representatives approved legislation to raise
the debt limit by at least $2.1 trillion and cut federal
spending by $2.4 trillion or more, a day before a default
deadline. The measure goes to the Senate for a final vote
planned for today in  Washington .  Manufacturing Slows  Stocks slid after the U.S. Institute for Supply
Management’s factory index showed that manufacturing activity
expanded in July at the slowest pace in two years, coming in
below even the lowest estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The
gauge fell to 50.9 last month from 55.3 in June. A reading of
more than 50 signals expansion. Economists projected the index
would drop to 54.5, according to the median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey.  The  U.S. economy  also grew at a less-than-forecast 1.3
percent pace in the second quarter following revised growth of
0.4 percent in the first three months of the year that was less
than previously estimated, the Commerce Department reported last
week. Reports on payrolls, unemployment and consumer spending
are due out this week.  ‘Historically Weak’  The manufacturing report “is a reminder that this overlong
and confidence-rattling debate about the debt ceiling takes
place against the backdrop of a historically weak economic
recovery,” said James Holt, Sydney-based director of BlackRock
Investment Management (Australia) Ltd., which oversees about $40
billion. “We still need to look at a couple more months of data
to assess where the recovery is at.”  BHP Billiton sank 1.7 percent to A$41.57 in Sydney and Rio
Tinto Group, the world’s second-biggest mining company by sales,
fell 1.8 percent to A$80.05.  Inpex Corp. (1605) , Japan’s largest oil
explorer, slipped 0.7 percent to 599,000 yen in Tokyo.  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , a Japanese trading house, sank 0.8
percent to 2,039 yen. Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. retreated 2.7
percent to HK$6.55 in Hong Kong.  Crude oil for September delivery fell 0.9 percent in New
York yesterday, while the London Metal Exchange Index of prices
for six industrial metals including copper and aluminum declined
1.6 percent.  Oil rose as much as 0.6 percent today after the U.S. House
of Representatives passed legislation to avoid a default in the
world’s biggest crude-consuming nation, before dropping again.
In New York, copper gained as much as 0.3 percent, before also
dropping.  Exporters Slide  Samsung fell 2.1 percent to 852,000 won in Seoul. Rival  LG
Electronics Inc. (066570)  dropped 1.2 percent to 79,900 won.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the camera maker that gets more than 80 percent
of its revenue abroad, slipped 0.5 percent to 3,755 yen in
Tokyo.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , the largest supplier of toys and clothes
to retailers including Target Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,
sank 2.3 percent to HK$12.94 in Hong Kong.  Cosco Corp. tumbled 14 percent to S$1.455 in Singapore
after the company said second-quarter net income fell 53 percent
from a year earlier to S$31.9 million ($26.5 million).  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. fell 3.7 percent
to HK$5.77 as a term sheet showed Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was
preparing to sell 638.06 million shares. The world’s largest
lender by market capitalization led declines among banks after
an official Xinhua News Agency website said  China  may boost
borrowing costs around Aug. 10, a day after inflation figures
are due to be released. China Construction Bank Corp. dipped 2.4
percent to HK$6.15.  China Inflation  Inflation in July will slow to 6.3 percent from a year
before compared with 6.4 percent in June, according to the
median estimate of nine economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
China’s government has a target of 4 percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index increased 0.9 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a gain of 2.3 percent by the
S&P 500 and a drop of 5 percent by the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index.
Europe’s benchmark entered a correction yesterday, having fallen
10 percent from its February high.  Stocks in the Asia-Pacific gauge were valued at 13.6 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 12.9 times for the
S&P 500 and 10.7 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
