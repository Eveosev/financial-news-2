Drax Group Plc (DRX) , operator of Western
Europe’s largest coal-fired power plant, said first-half
earnings rose 3 percent on “attractive” forward sales.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization climbed to 190 million pounds ($310 million) from
184 million pounds a year earlier, the Selby, England-based
utility said today in a statement. Sales rose 11 percent to 866
million pounds.  “Having entered the year with strong forward sales, and
having continued to operate the plant well, we have produced
good financial results for the period,” Chief Executive Officer
Dorothy Thompson said on a conference call. The company
generated around 6 percent of the U.K.’s renewable power in the
first half of 2011, she said.  Forward sales boosted first-half profit and locked in
prices that would not have been achieved otherwise, Drax said in
the statement. The company won’t see forward sales at a similar
level in the second half, Drax said, a factor that will drive
down full-year profit compared with 2010.  The utility, whose plant is about 200 miles (322
kilometers) north of  London , makes its profit largely from the
difference between the price of power and the price of coal,
after excluding costs for buying European Union emission permits
to offset carbon-dioxide emissions.  Drax will pay an interim dividend of 16 pence a share, or
58 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
