Tokyo Electron Ltd. (8035) , the world’s
second-largest maker of semiconductor equipment, fell the most
in more than four months after the company cut its profit
forecast.  The company dropped as much as 6.6 percent to 3,925 yen as
of 9:27 a.m. on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the biggest intraday
decline since March 17. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average
slipped 1.2 percent.  Asia ’s biggest chip-equipment maker forecast net income in
the year ending in March will be 34 billion yen ($440 million),
49 percent lower than its previous forecast, because sales will
be lower than expected. A recovery in demand may be muted,
Tetsuya Wadaki, a Tokyo-based analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc.  Wadaki cut his rating on the stock to “neutral” from
“buy” and the target price to 4,017 yen from 5,271 yen.  The reduced forecasts follow weaker-than-estimated earnings
at chipmakers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.,
the world’s largest contract manufacturer of chips. Slowing
demand for computers and concerns about  Europe ’s debt crisis are
forcing clients such as  Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM)  to reduce their sales
expectations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
