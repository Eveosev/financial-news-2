CBS Corp. (CBS) , owner of the most-watched
U.S. television network, said second-quarter profit soared,
beating analysts’ estimates as sales of reruns and fees from
cable TV systems increased.  Net income more than doubled to $395 million, or 58 cents a
share, from $150.1 million, or 22 cents, a year earlier, New
York-based CBS said today in a statement. That exceeded the 46-
cent average estimate of 23 analysts. Sales gained 7.7 percent
to $3.59 billion, also topping projections.  CBS is benefiting from higher ad rates, retransmission fees
from pay TV systems and revenue from new online outlets for
older TV shows, including  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  and  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  The
company, home to “CSI: New York” and “Two and a Half Men,”
garnered the highest ad-rate increase of any  broadcast network 
for the new prime-time season that starts in September.  CBS, controlled by Chairman  Sumner Redstone , fell 97 cents
to $26.31 at 3:59 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The stock had gained 43 percent this year before today.  Revenue from rerun sales and new online outlets increased
21 percent, the company said.  Amazon.com signed an agreement with CBS to offer TV shows
including “Num3ers” and “Medium” to the subscription service
Amazon Prime, the companies said last month. CBS and Netflix
announced an agreement in February for shows that include
“Dexter” from the company’s Showtime cable network and the
“Star Trek” TV series.  Based on new contracts, CBS will raise ad rates by an
average of 13 percent to 15 percent for prime-time shows in the
new season in September, a person with knowledge of the
situation said in July. The network received commitments for
more than 80 percent of its inventory, said the person, who
wasn’t authorized to speak publicly.  (CBS has scheduled a conference call for 4:30 p.m. New York
time at +1-800-575-5790 for U.S. callers and at +1-719-457-2710
for others.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
