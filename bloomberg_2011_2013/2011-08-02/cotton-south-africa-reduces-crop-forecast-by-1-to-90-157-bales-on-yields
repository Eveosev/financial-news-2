Cotton  South Africa , an industry
body, cut its forecast for the amount of the fiber its members
will produce this season by 1 percent to 90,157 lint bales.  Of that, 4,000 bales will come from Swaziland and the rest
from South Africa, the Pretoria-based group said in an e-mailed
statement today. The total harvest is still more than double the
size of last yearâ€™s crop, Cotton South Africa said.  A  bale weighs 200 kilograms (441 pounds).  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
