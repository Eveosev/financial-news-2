Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  will
meet with Rupert Murdoch’s newspaper editors in  Australia  after
her government criticized some of News Ltd.’s coverage of its
carbon tax plan.  Gillard will meet the editors late today at the invitation
of News Ltd. Chief Executive Officer John Hartigan, the prime
minister told reporters in Canberra today.  “Such meetings have been addressed by prime ministers and
opposition leaders in the past, so when I was invited by Mr.
Hartigan, I accepted,” Gillard said.  Australia may toughen privacy laws following revelations
of phone hacking at Murdoch's now-closed News of the World
newspaper in the U.K., Home Affairs and Justice Minister
Brendan O’Connor said last month. The Australian  Greens ,
whose votes Gillard’s minority government needs to pass
legislation, have called for an inquiry to set up a domestic
media watchdog.  News Ltd. is the Sydney-based Australian division of  News
Corp . and owns 120 metropolitan, regional and rural newspapers,
including The Australian and the Daily and Sunday Telegraph.  Communications Minister Stephen Conroy on July 18 said the
Sydney-based Daily Telegraph was “distorting” a national
debate on a carbon tax in order to oust the government.  Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes with
News Corp. units in providing financial news and information.  To contact the reporter for this story:
