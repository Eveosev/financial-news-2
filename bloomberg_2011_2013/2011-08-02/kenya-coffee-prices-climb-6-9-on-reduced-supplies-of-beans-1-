Kenya ’s coffee prices rose 6.9
percent at an auction today after supplies of the beans declined
amid improved quality and demand, the Nairobi Coffee Exchange
said.  The average price for all the coffee sold climbed to
$346.30 for a 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag, from $323.89 a week
ago, the exchange said by e-mail from the capital, Nairobi.  The benchmark AA grade increased 5.8 percent to an average
of $492.74 from $465.59 a bag last week after supplies fell 8.9
percent to 771 bags, it said.  “At the moment buyers are having a lot of orders from
outside,” Kizito Keya, a coffee trader at Mumba Coffee Ltd.,
said by phone from Nairobi. “We had better-quality beans and
people are buying heavily because there is little coffee in the
country.”  Sales at the auction rose 5.7 percent to 8,052 bags valued
at $3.41 million, from 7,619 bags worth $3.01 million last week,
the exchange said. Supplies fell 21 percent to 14,872 bags.  The East African nation harvests the bulk of its crop from
October through December, while a secondary crop is reaped from
April to June.  The following are details of today’s auction in U.S.
