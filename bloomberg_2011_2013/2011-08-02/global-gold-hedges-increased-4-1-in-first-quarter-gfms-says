Global gold hedges, or sales of
future production, gained about 4.1 percent in the first
quarter, researcher  GFMS Ltd . said.  The worldwide hedge book increased about 190,000 ounces to
4.88 million ounces from 4.69 million ounces in the fourth
quarter of 2010, London-based GFMS said in an e-mailed report
with Societe Generale SA. That’s the second quarter that miners
added to supply in the last five years, GFMS said.  Gold producers sometimes sell future output at fixed prices
to secure loans. They can reduce hedges by buying back
contracts, adding to demand. Bullion for immediate delivery
traded at $1,638.20 an ounce by 5:31 p.m. in London yesterday
after reaching a record $1,643.18. It’s up 15.4 percent this
year and set for an 11th straight annual gain, the longest
winning streak since at least 1920 in  London .  While some recent comments from miners “may suggest a
slightly more balanced attitude towards hedging than outright
dismissal of the idea, as has been the trend in recent years,
there has not been a fundamental shift back to widespread
hedging,” the researcher said in the report. “As such, we do
not expect a concerted return to hedging in 2011.”  Producers boosted supply by 1.66 million ounces compared
with a year earlier after hedging and mine output increases,
GFMS said. Companies will de-hedge about 800,000 ounces this
year, leaving the total hedge book at 3.88 million ounces, the
researcher estimates.  Mining company  Boliden AB (BOL) , based in  Stockholm , added about
330,000 ounces of forward sales in the first quarter, while
Toronto-based miner  Kinross Gold Corp. (K)  cut about 90,000 ounces
from its hedge book in the period, GFMS said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
