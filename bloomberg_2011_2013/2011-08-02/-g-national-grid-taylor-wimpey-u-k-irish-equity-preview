U.K. stocks fell the most since
November as speculation mounted that the U.S. will slide back
into recession after the world’s largest economy showed signs of
slowing down.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and  BP Plc (BP/)  retreated as the price of
oil fell for a fourth day. Glencore International Plc, the
world’s largest listed commodity trader, led the  FTSE 100 Index (UKX) 
lower, tumbling 7 percent.  Rexam Plc (REX)  surged 4 percent after it
reported a 29 percent increase in first-half profit.  The FTSE 100 dropped 133.88, or 2.3 percent, to 5,584.51 at
the 4:30 p.m. close in London, for the gauge’s fourth day of
losses and its largest retreat in more than eight months. The
benchmark measure has slumped 8.3 percent since its peak this
year on Feb. 8 on concern that  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis
will spread to the larger economies of Spain and  Italy . Five
stocks fell for every one that gained. The FTSE All-Share Index
declined 2.3 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index retreated
2.5 percent.  “This week has been all about bad economic data coming out
of the U.S.,” said Joshua Raymond, a market strategist at City
Index Ltd. in  London . “These have escalated fears of a big
slowdown in the global economy, not just the U.S.”  Martin Feldstein , economics professor at  Harvard
University , said yesterday that the  U.S. economy  is “balanced
on the edge.” Feldstein is a member of the Business Cycle
Dating Committee of the  National Bureau of Economic Research .  “There’s now a 50 percent chance that we could slide into
a new recession,” he said. “Nothing has given us much
growth.”  U.S. Debt Ceiling  President  Barack Obama  signed the debt-limit law yesterday
that prevented a U.S. default on the day the Treasury had warned
the nation’s borrowing authority would expire.  The Senate had earlier voted 74-26 for the measure, which
raises the nation’s debt ceiling until 2013 and threatens
automatic spending cuts to enforce $2.4 trillion in spending
reductions over the next 10 years. It won backing from 45
Democrats, 28 Republicans and one independent.  Royal Dutch Shell, Europe’s biggest oil company, dropped
3.6 percent to 2,112.5 pence. BP, Europe’s second largest, fell
2.2 percent to 433 pence.  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , a London-based oil explorer, led retreating
oil stocks across Europe. The company plunged 5.7 percent to
1,146 pence, its biggest drop in more than two years.  Cairn Energy, a Scottish oil explorer, sank 5.1 percent to
334.8 pence as it abandoned a well off the coast Greenland after
drilling failed to find oil.  Glencore,  BHP Billiton   Glencore International Plc plummeted 7 percent to 426.4
pence for the Switzerland-based commodity trader’s biggest
decline since its initial public offering in May. Mining
companies slumped as metal prices dropped.  BHP Billiton Plc (BLT) , the world’s largest mining company, fell
4.2 percent to 2,121 pence. Rio Tinto Group, the second biggest,
dropped 3.9 percent to 4,015 pence.  Rexam soared 4 percent to 368 pence, its largest gain in a
year. The world’s biggest beverage can maker reported first-half
net income of 132 million pounds ($216.6 million), compared with
102 million pounds in the year-earlier period.  National Grid Plc (NG/) , operator of the U.K.’s power and gas
networks, increased 1.2 percent to 609.5 pence.  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , Europe’s third-largest phone company by
sales, gained 0.9 percent to 170.5 pence.  India ’s  Supreme Court 
in  New Delhi  began to hear Vodafone’s argument that the
country’s tax department does not have the jurisdiction to make
claims on the English company’s takeover of Hutchison Whampoa
Ltd.’s local assets. The Bombay  High Court  ruled last year that
the authorities can seek claims on the $10.7 billion
acquisition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
