Vietnam ’s government bonds rose after
the benchmark money-market rate fell to the lowest level in
almost a month, signaling banks may have more cash to invest in
debt. The dong dropped.  The overnight interbank deposit rate declined five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 11.95 percent, the lowest
since July 6, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Interbank rates have dropped because there is a surplus
of funds in the market,” said Nguyen Thanh Danh, a Ho Chi Minh
City-based money-market dealer at Saigon Thuong Tin Commercial
Joint-Stock Bank.  The yield on the five-year bonds fell two basis points to
12.55 percent, according to a daily fixing from banks compiled
by Bloomberg.  The dong weakened 0.1 percent to 20,606 per dollar as of
3:30 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank fixed the reference rate at 20,608 today, unchanged
since July 11, according to its website. The currency is allowed
to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  --Diep Ngoc Pham in Hanoi. Editor: Simon Harvey  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
