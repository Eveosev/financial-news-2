Canadian natural gas fell as normal
temperatures were forecast for the Northeast and Midwest U.S.
for the next two weeks, curbing demand for the power-plant fuel.  Canadian gas prices, which usually follow their U.S.
counterparts on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , declined 0.2
percent as MDA EarthSat Weather of Gaithersburg, Maryland,
forecast normal temperatures for the U.S. Northeast and Midwest
for Aug. 7 to Aug. 16.  “We see more neutral weather for August with the Northeast
and Midwest U.S. being within normal ranges, which could look
bearish,” Laurent Key, vice president of natural gas research
at  Societe Generale  in New York, said in a telephone interview.
“And industrial demand for gas has posted a really low number,
almost 1 billion cubic feet below normal.”  Alberta  gas for September delivery dropped 0.5 cent to
C$3.31 per gigajoule ($3.28 per million British thermal units)
as of 10:35 a.m. New York time, according to  NGX , a Canadian
Internet market. October gas gained 0.5 cent to C$3.33. Gas
traded on the exchange goes to users in Canada and the U.S. and
is priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for September delivery fell 2.7 cents to $4.161
per million Btu as of 10:37 a.m. local time on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.  Power plants  use 30 percent of U.S. gas supplies, according
to the Energy Department.  “The northern tier will cool down,” Travis Hartman, a
meteorologist with MDA EarthSat, said in a forecast for Aug. 7
to Aug. 11 sent to clients.  Heat Warning  The high in Boston today may reach 86 degrees (30 Celsius),
2 above normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. of  State College ,
Pennsylvania.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.5 billion cubic
feet as of 9:30 a.m. in  New York .  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.56 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.18 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 1.11 billion cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.65 billion cubic feet today, about 60
percent of its capacity of 2.76 billion.  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
rose 5.71 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $4.378 per million Btu
yesterday on the Intercontinental Exchange. Alliance is an
express line that can carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the
Midwest from western  Canada .  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas gained 2.93 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $3.9006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
