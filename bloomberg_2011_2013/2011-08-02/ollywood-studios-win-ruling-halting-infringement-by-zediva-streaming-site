The  Motion Picture Association of
America , representing the major Hollywood studios, won a ruling
halting the operators of the movie-streaming service Zediva from
infringing their copyrights.  U.S. District Judge John Walter said in a ruling today that
the studios have demonstrated that they are likely to prevail in
their lawsuit and that they would be harmed if he didn’t grant
their request for an injunction.  “Judge Walter’s decision is a great victory for the more
than two million American men and women whose livelihoods depend
on a thriving film and television industry,” Dan Robbins,
associate general counsel for the association, said in a
statement. “Judge Walter rejected Zediva’s argument that it was
‘renting’ movies to its users.”  Zediva illegally streams movies to its customers without
obtaining required licenses from the movie studios, in violation
of the studios’ right to “publicly perform” their works, the
MPAA said in April.  The closely held company, based in  Santa Clara ,  California ,
offers 14 rentals of new-release DVDs for $2 per movie, or $1
when ordering 10 films. That undercuts what cable companies
charge for on-demand and is less than the $3 that  Time Warner
Inc. (TWX)  began charging in a test of 24-hour rentals on Facebook.  Michael Page, a lawyer for Zediva, didn’t immediately
return a call to his office after regular business hours.  The case is Warner Bros. Entertainment v. WTV Systems, 11-
2817, U.S. District Court, Central District of California ( Los
Angeles .)  To contact the reporter on this story:
