Consumer bankruptcies fell 18 percent
in July from the same period last year, the  American Bankruptcy
Institute  reported.  Consumers filed 113,470 bankruptcies last month compared
with 137,698 in July 2010, Alexandria, Virginia-based ABI said
in a statement today.  Last month’s number continues a series of declines that
began this year. In June, 119,768 consumers filed, down from
134,720 in April.  “Should these trends persist we expect to see fewer
consumer bankruptcies in 2011 than were filed in 2010,” ABI
Executive Director Samuel J. Gerdano said in the statement,
pointing to a deleveraging of household debts during the past
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
