Nigeria’s  central bank extended an
interbank credit guarantee for  Oceanic Bank International Plc (OCEANIC)  to
Dec. 31 after it signed a deal to be acquired by Togolese lender
 Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI)   The extension “should give the market the confidence to do
business with the bank,” Joe Ajewale, director of banking
supervision, told reporters in Abuja, the capital, today. The
extension to Oceanic, which was bailed out by the  Central Bank
of Nigeria  in 2009, should “encourage” the other rescued lenders
to speed up their search for investors, he said.  Ecobank, which operates in more than 30 African countries
including  Nigeria , agreed to buy Oceanic, its managing director,
John Aboh, said Aug. 1.  Oceanic is one of eight Nigerian lenders whose top
executives were fired by the central bank after loans to equity
speculators contributed to 700 billion naira ($4.6 billion) of
non-performing debt, according to the Economic and Financial
Crimes Commission. The regulator bailed out the lenders with 620
billion naira and has given them until Sept. 30 to recapitalize
or risk having their assets sold.  Similar extensions were given to Intercontinental Bank Plc,
Union Bank Nigeria Plc and Finbank Plc after the lenders signed
transaction agreements with new investors, the  Central Bank of
Nigeria  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
