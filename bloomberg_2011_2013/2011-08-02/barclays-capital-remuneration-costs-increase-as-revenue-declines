Barclays Capital , the securities unit
of  Barclays Plc (BARC) , allocated about 3 percent more for pay and
bonuses in the first half compared with the same period in 2010,
even as revenue fell.  Average total compensation per employee climbed to about
118,600 pounds ($193,000), compared with 115,000 pounds in the
first half of 2010, the London-based bank said in a statement
today. Barclays Capital set aside 45 percent of total revenue
for remuneration in the first six months compared with 42
percent in the year-earlier period.  Pretax profit at Barclays Capital fell 9 percent to 2.31
billion pounds in the first half of 2011 as revenue from trading
fixed-income, currencies and commodities shrank in the second
quarter. By comparison,  Switzerland â€™s UBS AG and Credit Suisse
Group AG said last week second-quarter earnings at their
securities units dropped about 71 percent.  Barclays Chief Executive Officer  Robert Diamond  told
reporters today he plans to cut a further 3,000 positions across
the company this year. Barclays Capital cut about 700 jobs in
the first half as incoming regulation and low trading levels ate
into profitability.  To contact the reporters on this story:
