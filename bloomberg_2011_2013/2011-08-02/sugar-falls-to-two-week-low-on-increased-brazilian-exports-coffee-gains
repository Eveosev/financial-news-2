Sugar fell to a three-week low on
signs of rising supplies from  Brazil , the world’s top exporter.
Cocoa declined.  Sugar shipments rose to an eight-month high in July,
Brazil’s Trade Ministry said yesterday. Last month, futures
jumped 13 percent on concern that output would trail estimates
by analysts. Prices will remain volatile as output shrinks in
Brazil and harvests increase in Asia, said Francois Nehama, a
director of trading at Sucden Americas Corp.  “There’s tons of supply that’s probably going to hit the
market before you know it,”  Michael Smith , the president of T&K
Futures & Options in Port Saint Lucie, Florida, said in a
telephone interview.  Raw sugar for October delivery slid 0.81 cent, or 2.8
percent, to settle at 28.16 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York . Earlier, the price touched 28.06
cents, the lowest for a most-active contract since July 7. The
commodity has dropped 12 percent this year.  Cocoa futures for September delivery fell $22, or 0.7
percent, to $2,933 a metric ton in New York.  On NYSE Liffe in  London , sugar and cocoa declined.  To contact the reporters on this story:
