Sprider SA, a Greek clothing
retailer, and its employees agreed on wage cuts of between 17
percent and 20 percent in exchange for no layoffs,  Imerisia 
reported, without citing anyone.  The labor agreement for the company’s 1,546 employees, both
at its retail outlets and central offices, is effective from
Aug. 1 to the end of 2012, the newspaper said, adding that it
follows a similar one between  Opap SA (OPAP)  and its employees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
