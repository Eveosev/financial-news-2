Japanese and Australian  stock futures 
fell after an unexpected decline in U.S. consumer spending
increased concern that growth in the world’s largest economy is
faltering and will harm earning by Asian exporters.  American depositary receipts of Honda Motor Co., a Japanese
carmaker which gets more than 40 percent of its revenue in  North
America , retreated 2 percent from the closing share price in
Tokyo. Those of  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s biggest camera maker
that derives 80 percent of its sales abroad, dropped 1.8 percent.
ADRs of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest mining company
and Australia’s No. 1 oil producer, lost 2.3 percent after crude
oil declined to a five-week low yesterday.  Futures on  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 9,660 in  Chicago  yesterday, compared with
9,830 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at T
9,680 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index declined 1.7 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX
50 Index dropped 0.6 percent in Wellington.  “Concerns about a slowdown in the  U.S. economy  are
increasing,” said Hiroichi Nishi, an equities manager in Tokyo
at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. “Growth in personal income is
weak and money is not flowing into spending that drives the U.S.
economy.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.2 percent
today. In New York yesterday, the index retreated 2.6 percent,
the most in a year, to a seven-month low of 1,254.05 after the
 consumer spending  report.  Confidence Slumps  Commerce Department figures showed purchases slid 0.2
percent in June after a 0.1 percent gain in May. It was the
first drop in consumer spending in almost two years. The median
estimate of 77 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for
a 0.1 percent increase. Incomes grew at the slowest pace since
November and the savings rate climbed.  A slump in confidence threatens to derail the U.S. economy.
The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of
consumer sentiment fell in July to the weakest since March 2009.
The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index also dropped in the week
ended July 24 to the lowest level since May.  Gross domestic product climbed at a 1.3 percent annual rate
in the second quarter after a 0.4 percent gain in the previous
three months that was less than earlier estimated, Commerce
Department figures showed July 29.  Debt Compromise  The Senate voted yesterday to ratify a U.S. debt-limit
compromise that will avert a default even as it defers decisions
on the nation’s finances to a bipartisan panel and may only
modestly reduce deficits. The House on Aug. 1 approved the
measure, which raises the national debt ceiling enough to fund
the government until 2013 and threatens automatic spending cuts
to enforce a goal of cutting $2.4 trillion over the next decade.  Moody’s Investors Service said the U.S. credit rating may
be downgraded for the first time on concern that fiscal
discipline may ease, further debt-reduction measures won’t be
adopted and the economy may weaken. The U.S., rated Aaa since
1917, was placed on negative outlook, New York-based Moody’s
said in a statement.  The yen appreciated to 76.96 against the dollar, compared
with 77.42 at the close of stock trading in  Tokyo  yesterday.
Against the euro, Japan’s currency strengthened to 109.21 from
110.32. A stronger yen hurts Japanese exporters because it cuts
the value of overseas sales.  Yen Talks  Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan,  Bank of Japan  Governor
Masaaki Shirakawa and other officials will hold a meeting today
to discuss the yen-dollar  exchange rate , the Mainichi newspaper
reported, without saying where it obtained the information.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 0.8 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with drops of 0.3 percent by the  S&P
500  and 6.8 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 13.5 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 12.6 times for the S&P 500 and 10.4 times
for the Stoxx 600.  Crude oil for September delivery dropped 1.2 percent to
$93.79 a barrel in  New York  yesterday, the lowest settlement
since June 28. Copper futures for September delivery dropped 0.3
percent in New York yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
