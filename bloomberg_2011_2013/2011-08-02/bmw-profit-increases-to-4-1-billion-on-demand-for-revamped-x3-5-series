Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , the
world’s largest maker of  luxury vehicles , earned record per-car
profit in the second quarter as demand for the 5-Series sedan
helped it beat  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi.  BMW generated the highest profit margin of the top three
luxury-car makers, with its auto unit posting earnings before
interest and taxes equivalent to 14.4 percent of sales, up from
9.6 percent a year earlier. That beat margins of 11.8 percent at
Audi and 10.7 percent at  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz.  “For an analyst who’s covered BMW for 11 years it’s
amazing to see this level of earnings,” said  Max Warburton , a
London-based Sanford C. Bernstein analyst with an “outperform”
rating on the stock. “At no point in the past would it have
been imaginable that this company could make margins of this
level.”  Demand for the revamped 5-Series sedan and X3 sport-utility
vehicle helped the maker of BMW, Mini, and Rolls-Royce models
keep its high-end segment lead. Deliveries this year of the
$45,050 5-Series have jumped 80 percent and the $36,750 X3 has
more than doubled, fueling an 18 percent rise in the BMW brand’s
first-half deliveries. Audi, which passed Mercedes this year and
aims to topple BMW by 2015, also boosted sales 18 percent.  Shares Advance  BMW closed down 1.92 euros, or 2.8 percent, at 65.79 euros,
after gaining as much as 2.4 percent in Frankfurt trading
earlier in the day. The stock has risen 12 percent this year,
valuing the company at 42 billion euros ($60 billion). VW is up
9 percent in 2011, while Daimler has dropped 6.5 percent.  BMW’s second-quarter Ebit climbed 66 percent to 2.86
billion euros, the Munich-based carmaker said today. Profit beat
the 2.3 billion-euro average estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  “This is not a one-time event for BMW,” said  Arndt Ellinghorst , a London-based Credit Suisse analyst with an
“outperform” rating on the shares. “They have the strongest
product lineup and best execution in the market.”  Germany ’s luxury-car makers are ramping up production to
satisfy growing demand in  China  and rebounding spending in the
U.S. Mercedes is building a factory in  Hungary  and expanding a
plant in  Alabama , while Audi has added production in  Spain .  BMW will expand a South Carolina factory to 300,000
vehicles next year from 270,000 in 2011, and will likely decide
in favor of building a new facility to assemble vehicles in
 Brazil  from parts produced at other plants, Chief Executive
Officer  Norbert Reithofer  said today.  Production Limit  “We are producing at the limit” and the waits for some
models like the X3 are “too long,” said Reithofer.  Second-quarter net income more than doubled to 1.81 billion
euros from 834 million euros as revenue gained 17 percent to
17.9 billion euros. Earnings were boosted by 464 million euros
in one-time gains from releasing risk provisions. Excluding the
one-time gains, BMW generated an auto margin of 13.9 percent.  BMW raised its 2011 profit and sales forecasts on July 12,
citing strong demand for its vehicles. The company today said
that ebit at its auto division will exceed 10 percent of revenue
in 2011, excluding one-time effects. Sales are projected to rise
to more than 1.6 million vehicles.  “From today’s perspective, it seems unlikely that we will
be able to maintain the high ebit margin of the second quarter
through the rest of the year,” Chief Financial Officer
Friedrich Eichiner said.  Slowing Growth  The increase in deliveries declined to about 7 percent in
July and growth will likely be slower overall in the second half
because of lineup changes and higher deliveries a year earlier,
the carmaker said.  “Global risks continue to increase rather than decrease,”
said Reithofer. “Concerted action of the international
community is required to be able to maintain economic and
financial strength worldwide.”  BMW will introduce an overhauled version of the 1-Series
compact in September in a bid to outsell Audi’s A3. Model
introductions will add about 500 million euros to expenses in
the final six months of 2011, while higher raw material prices
will increase costs by more than 100 million euros, Eichiner
said. The company is targeting margins in a range of 8 percent
to 10 percent on average after this year.  “BMW’s margins have peaked,” said  Juergen Pieper , a
Frankfurt-based analyst with Bankhaus Metzler who has a “sell”
rating on the stock. “The best phase of the cycle is behind it,
as the product mix will start deteriorating with the 1-Series.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
