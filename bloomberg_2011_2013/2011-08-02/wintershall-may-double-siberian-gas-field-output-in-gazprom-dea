BASF SE (BAS) ’s Wintershall unit may double
natural-gas production from a deposit in western Siberia after
an asset swap with OAO Gazprom expands its operations in Russia.  Wintershall expects Blocks 4 and 5 of the Urengoy field’s
Achimov layers to yield at least 8 billion cubic meters of gas a
year at plateau production, equal to forecast volumes at Block
1A, spokesman Nicholas Neu said today by phone, citing initial
estimates. Reserves will also probably match or exceed those at
Block 1A, currently being developed by both companies, he said.  Gazprom, Russia’s largest gas producer, and Kassel,
Germany-based Wintershall agreed in March to consider
collaborating at two additional areas of the Achimov layers.
Gazprom may gain equivalent stakes in Wintershall’s projects in
the  North Sea , they said at the time.  The companies plan to complete the asset-swap accord by the
end of the year, Neu said in an e-mail yesterday. They already
jointly develop the Russian Yuzhno-Russkoye field, as well as
Block 1A at Urengoy, and are partners in the Nord Stream
pipeline running from Russia to  Germany  and the planned South
Stream link to southern  Europe .  ZAO Achimgaz, a 50:50 venture between Gazprom and
Wintershall, is currently producing about 3.5 million cubic
meters of gas a day from six pilot wells at Block 1A, according
to Wintershall’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
