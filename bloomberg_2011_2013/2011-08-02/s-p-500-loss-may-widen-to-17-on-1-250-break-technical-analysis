The  bull market  in U.S. equities may
be in danger because industrial stocks failed to keep pace with
railroad and shipping companies, according to Richard Russell,
editor of the Dow Theory Letters newsletter.  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  reached its 2011 high on
April 29 and has since slipped 7.1 percent. The Dow Jones
Transportation Average, on the contrary, exceeded its April peak
on May 10, and rose to its highest level in 2011 on July 7,
Bloomberg data show.  Dow Theory, which stems from observations made by  Wall
Street  Journal founder Charles Dow during the late 1800s, holds
that moves by the transportation average must be “confirmed”
by the industrial measure, and vice versa, to be sustained.  “If the Dow confirms it will mean that the bull market
continues on its way,”  La Jolla , California-based Russell, 87,
wrote in the Aug. 2 newsletter. “A continued refusal by the Dow
to confirm will raise other questions, and undoubtedly serious
questions.”  The Dow industrial average fell for eight consecutive days
through Aug. 2 amid concern the two-year-old U.S. recovery is
faltering. The 30-company gauge rose yesterday, avoiding the
longest losing streak since 1978, amid speculation the  Federal
Reserve  may consider another stimulus program to prevent a
recession. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index briefly erased its
2011 gain this week after surging 102 percent from a 12-year low
in March 2009 through the end of April.  The odds of another U.S. downturn are rising amid cutbacks
in spending by consumers and the government, according to five
of the nine members of the panel that dates recessions. Harvard
University economics professor  Martin Feldstein , a member of the
Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of
Economic Research, said in an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s “Surveillance Midday” with  Tom Keene  on Aug. 2
that there’s a 50 percent of a new recession.  “Question -- Are we moving into ‘Great Recession’ number
2? Market acts like it,” said Russell, who has published Dow
Theory Letters since 1958. “Something ugly is definitely
brewing on Wall Street.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
