Belgacom SA (BELG) , the largest telephone
company in  Belgium , is being asked by the country’s market
regulator to explain why it delayed disclosure of the indictment
of Chief Executive Officer Didier Bellens for passive
corruption.  “We are sending a letter to ask why they consider that the
information concerning Mr. Bellens is privileged,” said Jim
Lannoo, a spokesman for the Brussels-based Financial Services
and Markets Authority.  Bellens was charged on June 21 with passive private
corruption relating to the 2005 sale of a Belgacom building for
less than the market price, according to a report by  La Libre
Belgique  dated July 28. Belgacom made a statement confirming the
indictment later that day.  The phone company said in the statement that Bellens
informed the board of directors in June and that an internal
probe by the company’s audit and compliance committee showed the
company’s interests were “fully protected.”  Jan Margot, a spokesman for Belgacom, declined to comment
today.  The judicial investigation “apparently relates to the 2005
sale of a building, property of ConnectImmo SA, a fully owned
subsidiary of Belgacom, to Xelis Siva SPRL,” Brussels-based
Belgacom said in last week’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
