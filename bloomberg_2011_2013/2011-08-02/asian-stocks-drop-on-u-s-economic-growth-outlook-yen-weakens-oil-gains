Stocks and commodities slid for a
fifth straight day while Treasury yields declined to the lowest
level this year amid signs the U.S. recovery is slowing. The
Australian dollar depreciated after the Reserve Bank kept its
cash rate unchanged.  The MSCI All-Country World Index lost 0.4 percent at 4:06

of 24 raw materials decreased 0.3 percent as oil traded near the 
lowest in more than a month in New York. The so-called Aussie

House approved legislation to raise the debt limit, a day before
a possible default. A report today is forecast to show personal

said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage $1 billion in global
equities at Pengana Capital Ltd. in  Melbourne . “The inference
from this bill is we’re likely to see spending cuts and economic
activity slowing further as a result. Strategists and investors
will need to readdress their growth expectations for the U.S.
and ultimately global growth moving forward.”  Stocks Slide  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index retreated 0.4 percent, extending
its slump from this year’s high to more than 10 percent. The

beaten analysts’ profit estimates than missed, overall profits

compiled by Bloomberg.  Kirin Holdings Co., Japan’s second-largest brewer by volume,

day, 4.3 percent drop. Personal incomes probably grew 0.2
percent in June after a 0.3 percent gain the previous month,
while  consumer spending  increased 0.1 percent, according to the
median forecasts of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Separately, the Labor Department may say on Aug. 5 nonfarm
payrolls climbed 85,000 last month, following an 18,000 increase
in June that was the smallest this year, a separate survey
showed. Treasuries extended a three-day rally.  The Senate will today in  Washington  hold a final vote on
the bill, which will raise the U.S. debt limit by at least $2.1
trillion and cut federal spending by $2.4 trillion or more,

manages $1.1 billion, in Walnut Creek,  California , said in a
Bloomberg Television interview. “Just like what has happened
with individuals and businesses, the government is now
deleveraging. The government is cutting back and it’s going to
slow economic growth.”  The so-called Aussie fell to $1.0899, extending a three-day
slump. The  Reserve Bank  of  Australia  kept its benchmark interest
