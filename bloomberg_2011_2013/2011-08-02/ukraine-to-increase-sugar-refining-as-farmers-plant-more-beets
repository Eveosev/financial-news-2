The number of factories refining
sugar in Ukraine will advance this year after farmers planted
more beets, Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said.  Eighty sites will process the root this year, compared with
73 in 2010, Prysyazhnyuk said today on the ministryâ€™s website.  Another 26 factories are idled and might operate if farmers
were to increase beet sowing, the minister said. The country can
produce 3 million metric tons of refined, or white, sugar a
year, permitting annual exports of about 1 million tons,
according to Prysyazhnyuk.  Increased output would enable Ukraine to sell refined
sweetener to  Russia  and other countries in the  Commonwealth of
Independent States  that will only be self-sufficient in sugar
after 2020, he said.  The ministry is in talks to export 100,000 tons of sugar to
Russia in 2012. Ukraine should aim to gradually increase its
shipments of refined sugar to Russia to 500,000 tons, according
to Prysyazhnyuk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
