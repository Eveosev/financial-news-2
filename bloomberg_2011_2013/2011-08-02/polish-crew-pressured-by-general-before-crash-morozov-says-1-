The pilots on a Polish plane that
crashed in  Russia  last year were under “psychological
pressure” to land by the commander of Poland’s air force, the
Interstate Aviation Committee said.  General Andrzej Blasik was in the cockpit and gave orders
that probably contributed to the crash in heavy fog that killed
President  Lech Kaczynski , Alexei Morozov, head of the technical
commission at the committee, told reporters in Moscow today.  Airport conditions in Smolensk didn’t play a role in the
accident, Morozov said.  The Interstate Aviation Committee is a body in the
Commonwealth of Independent States that investigates air
crashes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
