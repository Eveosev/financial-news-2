Fluxys (FLUX)  SA, the manager of Belgium’s
natural-gas grid, is about to finalize the purchase of two gas
pipelines from  Eni SpA (ENI) ,  Italy ’s largest energy producer,  Le Soir 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The transaction for the two pipelines linking Italy with
the Belgian-German border is valued at about 800 million euros
($1.4 billion), according to the newspaper. Fluxys is bidding
alone after Allianz left the partnership, Le Soir said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
