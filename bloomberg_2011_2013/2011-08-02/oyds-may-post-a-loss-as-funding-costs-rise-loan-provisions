Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , Britain’s
biggest mortgage lender, may report a first-half loss as rising
funding costs depress margins and it set aside 3.2 billion
pounds ($5.2 billion) for mis-selling loan insurance.  Lloyds may post a net loss of 2.1 billion pounds for the
six months to June 30, compared with a profit of 596 million
pounds in the year-earlier period, according to the median
estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The net
interest margin, the difference between what a bank earns on
loans and its funding cost, may shrink to 2.04 percent from 2.1
percent in 2010, Credit Suisse Group AG analysts including Carla
Antunes-Silva wrote in a note to investors last week.  “Net interest margin will be a key area of focus,” Gary
Greenwood, a banking analyst at Shore Capital in Liverpool,
wrote in an Aug. 1 report. “We expect margin progression to
stall in 2011. Impairments will also be in focus.”  Lloyds’s funding costs are rising as Chief Executive
Officer Antonio Horta-Osorio tries to wean the bank off state
support and onto costlier wholesale funding. The 41 percent
state-owned lender cut in June its net interest margin forecast
for 2014 to 2.3 percent from 2.5 percent and said it would
achieve a net interest margin of “just above” two percent this
year.  Job Cuts  Horta-Osorio said in June the bank would cut 15,000 jobs
and reduce costs by an additional 1.5 billion pounds as it re-
focuses on its U.K. business. Lloyds had already pledged 2
billion pounds of annual savings following its purchase of HBOS
Plc three years ago, which has so far resulted in about 27,000
job losses. The acquisition led the bank to accept a bailout of
more than 20 billion pounds to increase its capital.  Lloyds posted a full-year net loss of 320 million pounds in
2010, compared with a 2.83 billion-pound profit in 2009.  Lloyds has fallen 39 percent to 39.9 pence in London
trading this year, for a market value of 27.5 billion pounds.
The shares are the worst-performing British bank stock this
year.  The table below shows analysts’ median estimates for the
first half of 2011 in millions of pounds for Lloyds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
