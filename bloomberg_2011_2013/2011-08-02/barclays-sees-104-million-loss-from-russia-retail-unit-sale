-  Barclays Plc (BARC)  expects to incur a 64
million pound ($104 million) loss from the sale of its retail
and commercial arm in  Russia , according to its earnings
statement today.  The loss is “estimated based on the range of offers
received from potential buyers,” the statement said.  The bank announced a plan to sell the units in February to
focus on corporate and investment banking.  The U.K.’s third-largest bank acquired Russian retail
lender Expobank for $745 million in March 2008 before the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. pushed the economy to
its steepest contraction on record the following year as
commodity prices tumbled.  In a statement announcing the Expobank deal, Barclays said
the acquisition would generate a profit and achieve a return on
investment “significantly above the cost of equity” by 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
