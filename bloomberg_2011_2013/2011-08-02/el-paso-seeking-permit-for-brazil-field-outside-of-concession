El Paso Corp. (EP) , owner of the largest
network of interstate natural-gas pipelines in the U.S., said
it’s seeking to secure a permit from  Brazil ’s government to
develop a field that extends beyond a current concession.  A “very small portion” of the company’s offshore Pinauna
oil field extends beyond the licensed area and into a region
owned by the government, Gretchen Krueger, a spokeswoman for the
Houston-based company, said today in an e-mailed response to
questions.  Brazil’s oil regulator, known as ANP, asked El Paso last
week to negotiate an agreement to split any extra production
from the region extending beyond its concession with the
government, according to the ANP’s website. Pinauna is located
in shallow waters of the Camau Basin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
