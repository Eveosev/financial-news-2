Kohlberg Capital Corp. (KCAP) , the
investment company taken public in 2006 by leveraged-buyout
pioneer Jerome Kohlberg, won dismissal of a lawsuit filed by an
investor.  Kohlberg Capital was sued in federal court in  Manhattan  in
December 2009 by investor Dennis J. Angeleri of Muskegon,
Michigan, who accused the New York-based company of lying about
the value of its portfolio.  Angeleri said in the suit that Kohlberg Capital issued a
release in November 2009 that was “materially false” because
it misstated the value of the company’s investment portfolio.
Kohlberg asked U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldbaum Cedarbaum in
June to dismiss the complaint, saying its investments are
difficult to value.  Cedarbaum on July 28 signed an order approving Kohlberg’s
motion, according to a court document filed today. Cedarbaum
said Angeleri can file an amended complaint no later than
Aug. 22.  The case is Angeleri v. Pearson, 09-cv-10609, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
