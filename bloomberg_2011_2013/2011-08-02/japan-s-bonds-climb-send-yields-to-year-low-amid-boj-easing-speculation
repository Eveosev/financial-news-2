Japan ’s bonds rose, sending 10-year
yields to an eight-month low, as the yen trading near a postwar
high spurred speculation the central bank will add to monetary
easing to weaken the currency.  Bond futures advanced for the first time in three days
after the Nikkei newspaper said that the  Bank of Japan  will
consider increasing its asset-purchase program at a two-day
meeting ending Aug. 5.  Government bonds  climbed after demand was
stronger than expected at an auction of 10-year debt.  “Because I expect the yen to break a record, the central
bank’s additional monetary easing is my main scenario,” said
 Kazuhiko Sano , chief strategist at Tokai Tokyo Securities Co.,
one of the 25 primary dealers obliged to bid at government debt
sales. “My projection for the lower range of 10-year yields is
0.9 percent.”  The benchmark 10-year yield fell four basis points to 1.04
percent as of 3:11 p.m. in  Tokyo  at Japan Bond Trading Co., the
nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The 1.2 percent
security due June 2021 added 0.362 yen to 101.432 yen. The yield
was the lowest since Nov. 17.  Five-year yields declined 1.5 basis points to 0.355 percent,
also the lowest since Nov. 17. Ten-year bond futures for
September delivery advanced 0.24 to 142.02 at the 3 p.m. close
of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  The yen appreciated to 76.30 per dollar yesterday, nearing
the postwar high of 76.25 reached on March 17, the day before
Group of Seven countries jointly intervened in  currency markets 
to counter gains in Japan’s currency.  The lowest-accepted price at today’s auction, the minimum
at which the government sold 10-year debt, was 100.49 yen,
exceeding the 100.47 yen estimated by traders in a Bloomberg
News survey. The Ministry of Finance set the coupon rate at 1.1
percent, lowest since the sale in May.  The auction results were “resilient,” said Atsushi Ito, a
senior rate strategist in Tokyo at UBS AG, another primary
dealer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
