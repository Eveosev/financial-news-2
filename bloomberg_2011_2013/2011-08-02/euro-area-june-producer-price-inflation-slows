European producer-price inflation
slowed for a second month in June as energy costs retreated and
the euro-area economy cooled.  Factory-gate prices  in the 17-nation euro region increased
5.9 percent from a year earlier after rising 6.2 percent in May,
the European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today.
That’s in line with the median forecast of 20 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. Prices remained stable from May.  Crude-oil costs have dropped 17 percent over the past three
months, easing pressure on companies to raise prices as the
recovery shows signs of slowing. While the  European Central Bank 
last month raised borrowing costs for a second time this year,
European manufacturing growth slowed in July and economic
confidence dropped to the lowest in almost a year as a worsening
debt crisis clouded the region’s growth prospects.  Energy prices at the producer level rose 10.7 percent from
a year earlier after an 11.8 percent gain in May, today’s report
showed. The cost of intermediate goods such as  car engines  and
steel advanced 6.4 percent, down from a 6.6 percent increase in
the previous month, while capital goods including equipment and
machinery were 1.4 percent more expensive.  To contact the reporter on this story:
