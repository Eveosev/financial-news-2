Deacons Kenya Ltd ., a Kenyan clothing
retailer that plans to list its shares next year, said half-year
profit rose 73 percent from a year earlier as it opened new
stores.  Net income climbed to 45.6 million shillings ($500,000) in
the six months through June. Sales rose to 1.03 billion
shillings from 745.7 million shillings as the company opened new
outlets, Deacons said in a statement published in the  Daily
Nation  today.  Deacons said it had 29 stores as of June, up from 21 a year
earlier, and plans to increase that to 34 by the end of this
year. The company plans to open its first store in Rwanda in
October and add another in  Uganda  as well as two in Nairobi,
Chief Executive Officer Muchiri Wahome said in June. Deacons has
stores in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania and has acquired the
franchise for Dubaiâ€™s Babyshop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
