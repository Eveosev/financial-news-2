(Corrects month in eighth paragraph.)  Corn surged the most in three months
after a government report showed adverse weather eroded U.S.
crop conditions. Soybeans had the biggest gain in almost three
weeks, and wheat jumped to an eight-week high.  Last week, corn-crop  ratings  fell in  Iowa , the biggest
state grower, along with  Illinois ,  Nebraska , Indiana and
Missouri, the Department of Agriculture said in a report
yesterday. This July was the hottest since 1955 in the central
and eastern U.S. with average temperatures 3 degrees to 7
degrees Fahrenheit higher than normal, MDA Information Systems
Inc. said in a report.  “The corn crop has been damaged by the heat last month,
and rains will not improve yield potential in August,”  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst for Northstar Commodity Investment
Co. in  Minneapolis , said in a telephone interview.  On the Chicago Board of Trade, corn futures for December
delivery jumped by the exchange limit of 30 cents, or 4.4
percent, to close at $7.1575 a bushel at 1:15 p.m., the highest
for a most-active contract since June 9. The grain has surged 77
percent in the past year on declining global inventories.  The U.S. is the world’s leading exporter of corn, soybeans
and wheat. Prices rallied after Congress passed a measure to
raise the debt ceiling, heading off a default and boosting
prospects for commodity demand.  ‘Along for the Ride’  “Corn took off, and then the other grains came along for
the ride,”  Tomm Pfitzenmaier , a partner at Summit Commodity
Brokerage in  Des Moines , Iowa, said in a telephone interview.  About 60 percent of the soybean crop in the top 18
producing states was in good or excellent condition as of July
31, down from 62 percent a week earlier, USDA data show.  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 17.75 cents, or
1.3 percent, to settle at $13.7975 a bushel, the biggest gain
since July 13. The price has advanced 37 percent in the past 12
months.  Wheat futures for December delivery surged 38 cents, or 5.3
percent, to close at $7.5875 a bushel, the biggest gain since
July 13. Earlier, the price reached $7.645 a bushel, the highest
since June 14.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government figures
show. Wheat is the fourth-largest, behind hay, at $13 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
