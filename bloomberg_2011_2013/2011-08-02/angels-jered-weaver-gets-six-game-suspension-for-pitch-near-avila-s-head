Jered Weaver of the  Los Angeles
Angels  received a six-game suspension from Major League Baseball
for intentionally throwing a pitch near the head of  Detroit 
Tigers catcher Alex Avila on July 31.  Weaver was ejected for the incident, which came after he
allowed a seventh-inning home run to Carlos Guillen in the
Angels’ 3-2 loss. Weaver said he was angry Guillen flipped his
bat and stared at the pitcher following the home run.  “I’m not going to try to hit someone, but what Guillen did
crossed the line,” Weaver told reporters after the game.  Guillen said his actions were in response to Weaver yelling
at Detroit’s Magglio Ordonez after a third-inning home run. Home
plate umpire Hunter Wendelstedt issued a warning to both teams
after the incident between Weaver and Guillen, and threw Weaver
out of the game after his next pitch sailed over Avila’s head.  Angels manager Mike Scioscia, who also was ejected,
received a one-game suspension from  Major League Baseball . He’ll
serve the ban tonight against  Minnesota , while Weaver has
appealed his discipline.  Weaver has a 14-5 record for the Angels this season and
leads the American League with a 1.88 earned run average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
