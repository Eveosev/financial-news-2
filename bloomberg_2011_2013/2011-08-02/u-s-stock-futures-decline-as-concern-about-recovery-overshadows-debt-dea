Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures
expiring in September fell, indicating the gauge may be set for
a seventh day of losses, as concern the economic recovery is
faltering overshadowed lawmakers’ agreement to lift the
country’s debt ceiling to avoid a default.  The September contract slipped 0.5 percent to 1,273.3 at
2:59 p.m. in  Hong Kong  after rising as much as 0.4 percent after
the House of Representatives approved a bill to increase the
$14.3 trillion debt ceiling. September futures on the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  fell 46 points, or 0.4 percent, to 11,994.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
