South Korea , the world’s fifth-
largest oil importer, plans to begin operation at the country’s
first tidal-power plant tomorrow, three months earlier than
planned, to meet rising summer power demand.  The 254-megawatt plant off the western coast near Ansan
city will have annual output of 552 million kilowatt hours when
fully operating in December, the Ministry of Land, Transport and
Maritime Affairs said on its  website .  “We plan to shift to commercial production earlier than
planned as the summer power demand rises,” said Choi Won Gyu, a
director at the ministry. “It will help boost our energy self-
sufficiency ratios.”  About 496 billion won ($472 million) has been invested
since 2003 in the tidal plant, which will have the world’s
largest capacity, the ministry said.  The operation will help reduce imports by 862,000 barrels
of crude oil a yea, and cut greenhouse gas emission by 315,000
metric tons a year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
