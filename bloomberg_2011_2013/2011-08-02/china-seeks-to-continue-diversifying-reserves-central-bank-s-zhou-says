China  will continue to seek to
diversify reserve assets, strengthen risk management and
minimize the effect of fluctuations of global financial markets
on its economy, central bank Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said.  China will take “effective measures to maintain relatively
rapid growth to safeguard economic and financial stability,”
Zhou said, according to a statement posted on the People’s Bank
of China’s website today.  Zhou said China will “closely observe” the implementation
of the U.S. Budget Control Act of 2011, welcoming the law as
ensuring that the market functions effectively and investing in
U.S. Treasuries as safe.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
