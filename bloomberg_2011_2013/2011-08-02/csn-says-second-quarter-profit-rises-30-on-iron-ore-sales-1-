Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA,
 Brazil ’s third-largest steelmaker, said second-quarter profit
rose about 30 percent because of higher iron-ore sales and a
one-time gain after selling a stake in a mining company.  Net income gained to 1.14 billion reais ($726 million) from
878.8 million reais in the year-earlier period, the Sao Paulo-
based company said today in a statement. CSN, as the steelmaker
is known, was expected to post profit of 911 million reais on an
adjusted basis, the average of four analyst estimates compiled
by Bloomberg.  Revenue rose 12 percent to 4.32 billion reais as iron-ore
sales increased 8.3 percent from a year earlier to 6.74 million
metric tons and crude-steel sales were unchanged at 1.3 million
tons, CSN said. The company also posted a gain of 698 million
reais from selling a stake in Riversdale Mining Ltd. to Rio
Tinto Group in April.  CSN’s mining unit is helping the company offset lower
margins at its steel business. Brazilian steelmakers face a
“challenging” scenario in the second half of the year because
of weak prices, an appreciating local currency, high inventories
and increased competition in Brazil, Bank of America Corp.
analysts led by Felipe Hirai in  Sao Paulo  said in a note to
clients on July 21.  CSN fell 28 centavos, or 1.8 percent, to 15.52 reais in Sao
Paulo trading today. The earnings report, which was based on
international financial reporting standards, was released after
the close of regular trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
