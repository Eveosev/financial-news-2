South Africa  expanded its rapid-rail
line, connecting Johannesburg’s main business district with the
capital,  Pretoria , in a bid to ease traffic congestion in the
country’s richest province.  The Gautrain line between Rosebank station in Johannesburg
and Pretoria’s Hatfield, started running from 5.30 a.m. local
time today, Gautrain spokeswoman Nano Gasenewe said in a phone
interview. That will cut commuters’ journey time to between 30
and 40 minutes from as much as two hours during peak periods.  The rail-link between Johannesburg’s international airport
and Sandton first started operating on June 8 last year, three
days before the kick-off of the soccer  World Cup . The train
service currently carries 10,000 passengers daily and is
expected to be used by 100,000 commuters when the expansion is
completed, RATP Dev, which operates and maintains the network,
said in a statement on July 29. The final section between
Rosebank and Johannesburg’s Park station will be completed in a
few months, it said.  “The trip took half an hour, which is pretty amazing,”
Cathy van der Walt, a marketing manager for RALI, a leisure
company, said in a phone interview from Sandton Station.  Gautrain has cost 30 billion rand ($4.5 billion), compared
with an estimated 7 billion rand when the project was first
planned in 2002, the Johannesburg-based Star reported on July
29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
