Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s new social-networking
service drew about 25 million visitors in less than a month,
outpacing Facebook Inc. and MySpace in their early days,
according to market researcher  ComScore Inc. (SCOR)   The Google+ service had 6.44 million visitors in the U.S.,
its biggest market, through July 24, said Andrew Lipsman,
ComScore’s vice president for industry analysis, on a call
hosted by Lou Kerner, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. That
was followed by  India , with 3.62 million, ComScore said. The
figures don’t include mobile usage.  Google+, started in late June, is the company’s latest
effort to compete in social networking with Facebook, which has
more than 750 million users. Google+, which lets people connect
with and manage groups of friends, added about 5 million
visitors in less than a week to reach about 25 million,
according to  ComScore .  Engagement on the site is also increasing, Lipsman said.
The average number of days per week that U.S. visitors used the
service rose 39 percent in the seven days ending July 17. For
the week that ended July 24, usage rose 11 percent.  Google, based in Mountain View, California, fell $14.37 to
$592.40 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The
shares are little changed this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
