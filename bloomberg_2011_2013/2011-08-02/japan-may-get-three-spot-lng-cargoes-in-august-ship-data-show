Japan , the worldâ€™s biggest buyer of
liquefied natural gas, may receive at least three spot cargoes
of the fuel this month, according to ship-tracking data.  British Emerald may arrive in Sakai on Aug. 13 from
 Trinidad & Tobago , according to transmissions from ships
captured by AISLive on Bloomberg. LNG Imo may reach Kawagoe on
Aug.14, and LNG Ebisu may arrive at Sakai on Aug. 19, both from
 Nigeria , according to ship data.  Japan, which suffered damage to its nuclear and coal-fired
power plants in the March 11 earthquake, boosted Atlantic spot
purchases of LNG to a 33-month high in June to replace lost
electricity generation. The country purchased at least nine spot
cargoes costing an average $722 a ton in June, according to data
from the Ministry of Finance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
