Honda Motor Co.,  Japan ’s third-
largest automaker, plans to invest at least $500 million to
build a car factory in Mexico, El Financiero newspaper reported.  The plant will likely be located in Salamanca, a city in
the central state of Guanajuato, and construction would begin
next year, El Financiero  reported , citing Mexican Economy
Ministry officials it didn’t identify by name.  Honda’s press office in Mexico City declined to comment on
the report by El Financiero. Nikkei newspaper in Japan said
earlier this week that Honda will build an auto plant in Mexico
that produces the Fit compact car and will begin operation in
2014.  Honda has a plant in Mexico’s southwestern state of
Jalisco, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
