Dow Chemical Co. (DOW)  and other U.S.
ethylene and propylene makers will be able to raise prices as
customers stock up ahead of “record” plant-maintenance
outages, said Don Carson, an analyst at Susquehanna Financial
Group LLLP.  Dow,  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  will shut
crackers, as ethylene plants are known, for maintenance late in
this quarter, cutting U.S. output by 13 percent in September and
14 percent in October, Carson said in a report today. That
compares with 1.5 percent of production shut in July, he said.  Anticipation of tighter supplies will allow  LyondellBasell
Industries NV (LYB) , Dow and other producers this month to raise
contract prices for ethylene and propylene, produced in tandem
with ethylene, as well as for derivatives such as polyethylene
plastic, said Carson, who is based in  New York .  Hassan Ahmed, a New York-based analyst at Alembic Global
Advisers, said in a report yesterday that 8 percent of U.S.
ethylene capacity will be shut for maintenance on average in the
third quarter, and 13 percent of Asian production will be idled.
Carson’s estimate includes maintenance projects that haven’t
been officially announced by the companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
