Corn dropped in Chicago after
rainfall in the U.S. Midwest prevented the crop’s condition from
worsening, according to the Department of Agriculture.  About 62 percent of the crop was rated good or excellent in
the week through July 31, unchanged from the prior week, the
USDA  said . As much as 5 inches of rain fell in parts of Iowa and
 Illinois , the biggest U.S. corn growers, in the past week,
National Weather Service data show. Parts of Nebraska, Missouri
and Indiana received 1 to 2 inches.  “The condition of the U.S. corn crop stabilized last week,
thanks to rain in the key growing areas,”  Carsten Fritsch , an
analyst at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt , said in a report today.
While heat slowed growth, “if the weather remains favorable,
these deficiencies could still be remedied, so that a serious
shortfall in the crop yield need not yet be expected,” he said.  Corn for December delivery fell 1.5 cents, or 0.2 percent,
to $6.8425 a bushel by 1:15 p.m. London time on the  Chicago 
Board of Trade. The grain climbed 7.8 percent in July as heat
and dryness in the U.S. Plains and Midwest curbed crop
prospects.  Wheat for December delivery declined 2.25 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $7.185 a bushel. The grain added 17 percent last
month, rebounding from June’s 21 percent plunge. Milling wheat
for November delivery slid 75 cents, or 0.4 percent, to 196.75
euros ($278.56) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in Paris.  The U.S. soybean crop ratings were lowered to 60 percent
good or excellent from 62 percent the prior week, according to
the USDA report.  Soybeans for November delivery gained 2.75 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $13.6475 a bushel in Chicago after adding as much as
0.6 percent. The oilseed climbed 4.9 percent in July, rebounding
from a three-month, 8.2 percent retreat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
