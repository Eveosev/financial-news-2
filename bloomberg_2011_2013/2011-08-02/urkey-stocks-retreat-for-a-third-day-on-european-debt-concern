Turkish stocks retreated for a third
day, reversing earlier gains, as concern mounted that slowing
global growth will hamper efforts to contain  Europe ’s debt
crisis.  The benchmark  ISE National 100 Index (XU100)  fell 63.79, or 0.1
percent, to 61,862.82 at 11:21 a.m. in Istanbul. The gauge

third day, depreciating 0.2 percent to 1.6950 per dollar.  Italian and Spanish 10-year bonds fell, pushing yields up
to euro-era records versus benchmark German bunds as concern

for riskier assets. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index dropped 1.2
percent and the MSCI All-Country World Index lost 0.4 percent.
U.S. Treasuries rose for a fourth day.  “The problem here is not  Turkey ,” Isik Okte, a trader at
