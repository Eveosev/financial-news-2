Google Inc. (GOOG)  faces nine formal
complaints in a European Union antitrust probe, Reuters
reported, citing two people it didn’t identify.  Reuters said five recent complaints over Google’s behavior
came from small companies. Three of those were transferred to
the European Commission from national antitrust regulators and
two were made directly to the Brussels-based EU agency, Reuters
said, without identifying the companies.  Al Verney, a spokesman for Google, declined to immediately
comment on the report when contacted by Bloomberg News, as did
Mark English, a spokesman for the commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
