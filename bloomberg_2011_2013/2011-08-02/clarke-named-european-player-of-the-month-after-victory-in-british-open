Darren Clarke was named European
Tour’s Golfer of the Month for July following his victory at the
 British Open .  Clarke, 42, captured the Open at Royal St. Georges in
Sandwich, England, by three shots over Americans Dustin Johnson
and Phil Mickelson. It was the Northern Irishmen’s first major
title and came in his 20th appearance at golf’s oldest
championship.  “It’s always good to win a golfer of the month award, but
this one is special because I won it on the back of winning the
Open,” Clarke said in a  statement . “Any award I get on back of
winning the Claret Jug will always be gratefully received!”  The July 17 victory at Sandwich jumped Clarke to 30th in
the  Official World Golf Ranking  from 113th. He’s currently at
No. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
