Gold climbed to a record in  New York 
and London as concern that global economic growth may be slowing
boosted demand for the metal as a protection of wealth.  Manufacturing indexes in the U.S.,  Europe  and China
declined in July, raising concern that the global recovery is
losing momentum. Gold fell yesterday after the  House of
Representatives  passed a measure to raise the U.S. debt limit
and cut federal spending. The Senate is scheduled to vote on the
deal today. The metal touched all-time highs in euros, pounds
and Canadian dollars.  “All the ongoing economic uncertainty and fears of a
downgrade of the U.S. AAA sovereign rating are gold
supportive,”  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital in
 London , wrote in a report. “Weak macro numbers would also delay
the tightening cycle in the U.S.”  Gold for December delivery gained as much as $22, or 1.4
percent, to $1,643.70 an ounce and traded at $1,641 by 8:39 a.m.
on the Comex in New York. Immediate-delivery gold was up 1.2
percent at $1,638.50 in London and reached a record $1,640.05.  Gold is up 15 percent this year, heading for an 11th
straight annual gain, the longest winning streak since at least
1920 in London. The MSCI All-Country World Index of equities
rose 0.3 percent in 2011, the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24
commodities is up 7.9 percent and Treasuries returned 4.5
percent, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index.  Slower Growth  The U.S. Institute for Supply Management said yesterday
that its factory index dropped to 50.9 last month from 55.3 in
June, expanding by the slowest pace in two years.  China ’s
purchasing manufacturing index moderated to 50.7 from 50.9,
while a manufacturing gauge in the euro region dropped to 50.4
from 52, reports yesterday showed.  The House voted 269-161 to approve the measure, which
raises the national debt ceiling enough to fund the government
until 2013 and threatens automatic spending cuts to enforce a
goal of cutting $2.4 trillion over the next decade. That goal
falls short of the long-term deficit savings that President
Barack Obama and Republican leaders initially sought.  The Treasury Department said it would run out of options
for avoiding default today without action by Congress to raise
the $14.3 trillion ceiling. The U.S. still faces the threat of a
rating downgrade,  Bill Gross , who runs the world’s biggest bond
fund, said yesterday on PBS’s Nightly Business Report.  “Increasing the debt ceiling is not going to make the debt
go away, while the debt problems in Europe aren’t going to be
resolved overnight, and we’re seeing all these getting reflected
in the weaker economic numbers,” said Zhang Yingying, an
analyst at brokerage Galaxy Futures Co.  ‘Well-Supported’ Prices  Holdings of the metal in exchange-traded products rose for
a sixth day yesterday, climbing 1.4 metric tons to a record
2,153.6 tons, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Gold prices  are “well-supported at current levels” as
central banks move excessive foreign-exchange holdings into
bullion and inflation in China and  India  boosts the lure of the
metal, Gary Halverson, regional Australia-Pacific president at
 Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s largest producer, said today at
a conference in Kalgoorlie,  Australia .  The Bank of  Korea  bought 25 tons over a one-month period
from June to July, lifting its reserves to 39.4 tons, the
central bank said, declining to comment on the price and plans
for additional purchases.  Thailand ’s gold reserves rose to about
4.07 million ounces in June, from about 3.523 million ounces in
May, according to figures on the Bank of Thailand’s website.  Silver for September delivery in New York rose 1.4 percent
to $39.86 an ounce. Palladium for September delivery gained 0.6
percent to $834.80 an ounce. Platinum for October delivery was
0.2 percent higher at $1,799 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
