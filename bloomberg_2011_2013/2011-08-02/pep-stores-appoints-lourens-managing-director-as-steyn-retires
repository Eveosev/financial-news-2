Pep Stores Ltd., the South African
clothing retailer that has more than 1,600 stores, said Leon
Lourens will succeed George Steyn as managing director when
Steyn retires next month.  Lourens, Cape Town-based Pep’s operations and sales
director, has been with the company for 22 years. He has been
“instrumental” in the company’s growth over the last few
years, Pieter Erasmus, managing director of Pep’s parent
company,  Pepkor Ltd. , said in a statement.  Steyn joined Pep in 1986 as a trainee and was made a
director five years later. He was appointed as managing director
in 2005. He has also served on the Pepkor executive committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
