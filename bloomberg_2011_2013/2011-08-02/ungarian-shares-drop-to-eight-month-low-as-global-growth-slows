Hungary’s benchmark stock index fell
to its lowest in eight months amid concern that a slowdown in
the U.S. economy is derailing global growth.  The BUX gauge of 13 companies slid 1.3 percent to 20,868.39
as of 9:16 a.m. in Budapest, the lowest intraday level since
Dec. 1. OTP Bank Nyrt., the country’s largest lender, retreated
2.2 percent, and Mol Nyrt., the biggest oil refiner, fell 0.5
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
