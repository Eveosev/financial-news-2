Cuba has a long way to go before
reforms are successful, said President  Raul Castro , who has
vowed to open the economy to private enterprise.  In a speech to the National Assembly yesterday, Castro said
officials would further relax rules on self-employment and make
it easier for Cubans to own cars and homes. The changes are
needed to overcome “costly inefficiencies,” he said, without
providing details of the new regulations.  The Cuban government announced plans almost a year ago to
“redesign” the country’s largely state-run economy as it
sought to lay off 500,000 workers and encourage them to go into
business for themselves.  “It’s indispensable to restore financial discipline in the
economy,” Castro said, according to a  transcript  of the speech
posted today on government website Prensa Latina. “Once again,
the greatest obstacle we face in implementing the resolutions is
the psychological barrier caused by inertia.”  Since his brother Fidel began handing over power in 2006,
President Castro, 79, has initiated measures to open the
economy, including loosening of property laws and controls
prohibiting private enterprise such as taxi and mobile phone
companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
