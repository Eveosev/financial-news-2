Egypt ’s benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30) 
declined to the lowest in almost three months, losing 2.1
percent to 4,967.04 at the 1:30 p.m. close in Cairo.  The following shares rose or fell. Symbols are in
parentheses.  Citadel Capital SAE (CCAP EY) retreated 2.7 percent to 4.75
Egyptian pounds, the lowest level since May 16. Investors may be
concerned near-term gains in the stock price of the Cairo-based
private equity firm will be limited, said Ryan Ayache, a Dubai-
based banking analyst at Deutsche Bank AG.  “Operationally, a lot of their investments are doing well,
but it doesn’t mean investors will make good returns on the
stock right now,” Ayache said. Also, “There may have been some
hot money in the stock hoping to benefit from a transaction with
Abraaj Capital.” Talks for a Citadel stake sale to Abraaj broke
down last week.  Nile Cotton Ginning (NCGC)  Co surged 4.9 percent, the
most in almost two months, to 11.63 pounds. National Bank of
Egypt lowered the  interest rate  it charges textile manufacturers
to 11 percent for projects that start in the next 18 months,  Al
Mal  newspaper reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
