Canada  plans to invest C$97 million
($101 million) in clean-energy projects in the next two years,
Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver said today in Toronto.  The EcoEnergy initiative is to concentrate on five areas:
efficiency, clean electricity, bio-energy, electric vehicles,
and unconventional oil and gas, the minister said at Ryerson
University’s Center for Urban Energy.  Government funding for clean energy advanced a project to
harness tides in Nova Scotia’s Bay of Fundy, which has some of
the world’s  largest  tidal ranges, and designed batteries to
replace diesel generators in remote British Columbia towns as
Canada aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 17 percent below
2005 levels by 2020, Oliver said.  “Both of these projects are the first of their kind in
Canada,” he said. “This investment announced today will
generate new opportunities for Canadian clean-energy companies
and our research community.”  The funding will be used in research, development and
demonstration projects open to proposals from utilities,
industry associations, provinces and territories, and nonprofit
and community groups, the minister said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
