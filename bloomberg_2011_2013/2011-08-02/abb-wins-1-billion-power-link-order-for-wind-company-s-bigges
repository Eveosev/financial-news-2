ABB Ltd. (ABBN) , the largest maker of power-
transmission gear, won a $1 billion order from TenneT Holding BV
to connect North Sea wind farms to the German electricity grid.  It’s the largest transmission order in ABB’s history, the
Zurich-based company said today in a statement on its  website ,
and will be able to supply power to more than 1.5 million homes
from offshore farms including the 400-megawatt Gode Wind II.  Germany  says  utilities are capable of building 20 to 25
gigawatts of offshore wind generation by 2030 as the country
seeks to close atomic plants following the nuclear disaster in
Fukushima,  Japan . ABB said the latest order is its third to
provide transmission for offshore wind power in  Germany .  The link, the largest offshore high-voltage direct current
system with capacity of more than 900 megawatts, will begin
operating in 2015, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
