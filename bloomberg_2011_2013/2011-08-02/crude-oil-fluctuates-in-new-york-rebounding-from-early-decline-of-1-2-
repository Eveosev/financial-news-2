Crude oil fell to a five-week low in
 New York  and reached a record discount against  Brent crude  as a
drop in U.S. personal spending signaled growth is slowing in the
world’s biggest oil-consuming country.  Futures dropped 1.2 percent after the Commerce Department
in  Washington  said purchases slipped 0.2 percent in June, the
first decline in almost two years. The decrease in prices
accelerated after President Barack Obama signed a bill to raise
the U.S. debt limit by at least $2.1 trillion, averting by hours
a first-ever U.S. financial default.  “There’s a great deal of nervousness about the direction
of the economy,” said  Michael Lynch , president of Strategic
Energy & Economic Research in Winchester,  Massachusetts . “All
of the talk of a possible default has already done a lot of
damage to  consumer confidence . The economy wasn’t looking good
before today, and now it’s looking worse.”  Crude oil for September delivery fell $1.10 to $93.79 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
settlement since June 28. Prices have gained 15 percent in the
past year.  Prices fell as low as $93.08 in electronic trading before
paring losses after the  American Petroleum Institute  reported
that U.S. crude-oil stockpiles dropped 3.31 million barrels to
354.9 million. Oil declined $1.45, or 1.5 percent, to $93.44 a
barrel in electronic trading at 4:32 p.m.  Brent oil for September settlement declined 35 cents, or
0.3 percent, to end the session at $116.46 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The European benchmark
contract reached a record premium of $22.67 a barrel to New York
futures based on closing prices.  Slowing Economy  Consumer purchases were forecast to increase 0.1 percent,
according to the median estimate of 77 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Incomes grew at the slowest pace since November
and the savings rate climbed.  “The economy appears to be grinding to a halt,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago . “A
slowing U.S. economy changes the demand outlook for oil. We may
end up with a glut, not shortages, later this year.”  The U.S. probably didn’t create enough jobs in July to cut
unemployment, according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists
before the Labor Department’s employment report on Aug. 5.  “There’s been plenty of bad economic news,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge
fund that focuses on energy. “We’re going to be white-knuckling
it until Friday when we will see if employment rose. That should
be the next catalyst for a major move.”  Equities Decline  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 2.6 percent to
1,254.05 at 4:31 p.m., dropping a seventh straight day in its
longest slump since 2008. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
declined 2.2 percent to 11,866.62.  The dollar rose 0.4 percent to $1.4197 against the euro,
from $1.425 yesterday, after climbing to $1.4151, the highest
level since July 21. A stronger U.S. currency reduces the appeal
of dollar-denominated raw materials as an investment.  “We’re tracking the dollar and equities,” said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research at Tradition Energy in
Stamford, Connecticut.  The Senate voted 74-26 for the measure, which raises the
nation’s debt ceiling until 2013 and threatens automatic
spending cuts to enforce $2.4 trillion in spending reductions
over the next 10 years. The House passed the plan yesterday.  Federal Reserve   Federal Reserve policy makers may start weighing more steps
to prop up the recovery after growth fell below 1 percent in the
first half of this year and economists began cutting second-half
growth forecasts. During the first half of 2011, the Fed carried
out a $600 billion program in asset purchases known as
quantitative easing.  Tropical Storm Emily’s maximum winds have strengthened to
45 mph from 40 mph south of  Puerto Rico  and at least two
computer forecast models suggest it will dissipate near the
island of Hispaniola, the National Hurricane Center said today.
Emily is 215 miles (345 kilometers) south-southeast of  San Juan ,
Puerto Rico and moving west at 12 mph, according to an  advisory 
issued at 2 p.m. in Miami.  “Prices would be a lot lower if it weren’t for Emily and
the prospect that the Fed might announce a new round of
quantitative easing,” Flynn said.  An Energy Department report tomorrow may show U.S. crude
oil supplies climbed 1.5 million barrels last week, according to
the median of 14 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  “A rebound in the dollar and weaker equities will keep oil
down until at least the inventory reports,” said  Hamza Khan , an
analyst with the Schork Group Inc., a consulting company in
Villanova, Pennsylvania.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 548,471
contracts as of 4:31 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 689,962
contracts yesterday, the most since July 14 and 3 percent above
the average of the past three months. Open interest was 1.54
million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
