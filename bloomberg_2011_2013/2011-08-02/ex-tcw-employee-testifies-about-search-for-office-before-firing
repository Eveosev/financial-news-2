Barbara VanEvery, DoubleLine Capital
LP’s communications director, told jurors she began looking for
 office space  months before TCW Group Inc. fired her and  Jeffrey Gundlach  in December of 2009.  VanEvery testified yesterday at a trial in which she,
Gundlach and two other former TCW employees are accused setting
up DoubleLine with stolen  trade secrets  and proprietary
information. They have countered that TCW fired them to avoid
paying Gundlach’s group hundreds of millions of dollars in
performance fees.  Under questioning by TCW’s lawyer, VanEvery said she
retained a real estate broker in September of 2009 to find
office space because she expected that either Gundlach would get
fired or that he and his group would leave TCW through a
negotiated departure.  “I was under the impression that something was going to
happen by December,” VanEvery told jurors yesterday in state
court in Los Angeles. “It was coming to a head. I felt there
was going to be some kind of separation.”  Gundlach, 51, was the investment chief at TCW, the Los
Angeles-based unit of  Societe Generale. (GLE)  He started DoubleLine in
December 2009, 10 days after TCW fired him. TCW sued Gundlach a
month later, after half of its fixed-income professionals had
joined  DoubleLine . Gundlach countersued, saying he was fired so
that TCW wouldn’t have to pay management and performance fees.  Downloading TCW Information  Also yesterday, Jeffrey Mayberry, who like VanEvery is a
defendant and counterclaimant in the case, testified that he
started downloading TCW information, including a mortgage-backed
securities database and client portfolio holdings on Sept. 3,
2009. He said that was when people in Gundlach’s unit thought
TCW Chief Executive Officer Marc Stern was about to fire
Gundlach.  Mayberry said he started downloading at the instruction of
his supervisor, Cris  Santa Ana , the fourth former TCW employee
involved in the case. Santa Ana sat at a work station next to
him at TCW’s trading desk and used an external hard drive to
download data on a daily basis, Mayberry said.  Mayberry, who was fired at the same time as Gundlach and
joined his new firm soon after, said under cross-examination by
DoubleLine’s lawyer that, at the new firm, they weren’t allowed
to use any files they had that were created by TCW.  TCW alleges that Gundlach and the others wouldn’t have been
able to get DoubleLine up and running as quickly as they did
without use of TCW’s proprietary information.  $70 Billion  While he was at TCW, Gundlach managed or oversaw about
$70 billion of the company’s $110 billion in assets, according
to the May 14, 2010, amended cross-complaint.  TCW clients withdrew about $25 billion after Gundlach was
fired. TCW said in its complaint that Gundlach lied to its
clients in a series of webcasts in December 2009 to incite them
to join DoubleLine and to malign TCW’s newly acquired fixed-
income management unit, Metropolitan West Asset Management LLC.  DoubleLine claims TCW clients started withdrawing billions
of dollars immediately after Gundlach was fired and before any
webcasts.  VanEvery testified that she used a computer file with
contact information she got at TCW to help set up a webcast with
investors shortly after Gundlach was fired. The file was created
by an outside vendor, according to VanEvery.  “People were calling us at home,” VanEvery said. “They
were concerned about the condition their portfolios were left
in.”  VanEvery is scheduled to finish her testimony today.  The case is Trust Co. of the West v. Gundlach, BC429385,
California Superior Court,  Los Angeles  County.  To contact the reporter on this story:
