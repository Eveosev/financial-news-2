Alan Greenspan , the former chairman
of the U.S. Federal Reserve, who argued in a July 27 article in
the Financial Times that compelling banks to use more equity
funding is misconceived, was criticized by a group of prominent
economists in today’s issue of the newspaper.  In a letter signed by, among others, Anat Admati of
Stanford University,  Charles Goodhart  of the London School of
Economics and David Miles of  Imperial College London , it’s
argued that tougher capital requirements don’t constrain how
banks invest their funds but merely require them to use less
debt and more equity funding for investments.  Changing the funding mix “imposes few, if any, costs on
the economy,” while offering better incentives to manage risk
and fewer refinancing difficulties because of overhanging debt,
the economists said.  In the 19th century, banks funded their assets with as much
as 40 percent equity, and today banks often require borrowers to
contribute equity of more than 25 percent, according to the
letter.  The signatories conclude that “low equity requirements and
manipulable risk-weighting systems,” rather than excessive
equity, permit systemic risk to develop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
