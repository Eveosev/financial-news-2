Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s patent complaint that
seeks to block imports of Samsung Electronics Co.’s Galaxy S
mobile phone and Galaxy Tab computer will be reviewed by the
U.S. International Trade Commission.  The ITC, a quasi-judicial agency in Washington that
arbitrates trade disputes, said in a  notice  today it instituted
the investigation. The commission, which typically takes 15 to
18 months to complete the review, has the power to block imports
of products that infringe U.S. patents.  Apple and Samsung have each lodged patent-infringement
cases against each other in the U.S.,  Europe ,  Asia  and
Australia. The ITC last week said it would investigate a
complaint Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung filed to block
imports of Cupertino, California-based Apple’s iPhone and iPad.  Apple, which has accused competitors of “widespread
imitation,” has taken particular aim at Samsung, which had been
a supplier of chips for some Apple devices. Apple contends that
the Galaxy phone and tablet “slavishly” copy the iPhone and
iPad.  The new case is In the Matter of Certain Electronic Digital
Media Devices, 337-796, and Samsung’s case is In the Matter of
Mobile Electronic Devices, including Wireless Communication
Devices, Portable Music and Data Processing Devices, and Tablet
Computer, 337-794, both U.S. International Trade Commission
