Global rapeseed production will fall
1.5 percent in the 2011-12 marketing year on a decline in the
European Union, Oil World said.  World output will drop to 59.1 million metric tons from
59.98 million tons in the prior period, the Hamburg-based
researcher said today in a report. EU output will slide 8.3
percent to 18.88 million tons as usage declines 3.6 percent, it
said. Wet weather delayed EU harvesting. Chinese output will
fall 4.9 percent to 11.6 million tons, the report showed.  “Harvesting was considerably delayed during July in many
regions,” the researcher said. “Latest harvest reports,
however, have turned out somewhat better than feared.”  Canola, as the oilseed also is known, fell 8.2 percent in
the second quarter on ICE Futures Canada in Winnipeg after four
quarters of gains.  EU processors will use 21.4 million tons of rapeseed, Oil
World said. The 27-nation bloc will import 3.1 million tons in
the year that started July 1, up 14 percent from the prior
period, according to the report.  Germany  was the largest EU rapeseed producer in 2010 and
 France  ranked second, according to figures from the bloc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
