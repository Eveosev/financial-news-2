Germany ’s  air-traffic controllers 
will stage a six-hour strike over pay this week in a protest
that could affect thousands of flights at  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) 
and dozens of other airlines, the GdF union said today.  The GdF will ask 3,400 controllers to walk out between 6
a.m. and noon on Aug. 4 after rejecting revised wage proposals
from Deutsche Flugsicherung GmbH, Germany’s air navigation
service provider, the labor group said in a statement.  Almost 96 percent of union members backed industrial action
in a poll result announced yesterday, and talks are at a point
where there is “no alternative other than to strike,” the GdF
said. Lufthansa said it’s following the situation with “great
concern” and urged the sides to reach a settlement, while DFS
said it’s not clear how severe potential disruption might be.  “We’re trying to find a solution but we don’t know if
we’ll manage by Thursday morning,” DFS Managing Director Jens Bergmann said at a press conference in  Frankfurt . “We don’t know
exactly how many employees will decide to strike.”  DFS workers coordinate as many as 10,000 flights in German
airspace every day, and anything between 2,000 and 3,000
services could be affected in the strike, Markus Siebers, the
union’s wages and rights representative, said by telephone.  “The DFS is not taking our demands seriously,” he said.  The employer’s revised proposals were rejected because they
failed to meet non-negotiable demands including a pay increase
in line with inflation, the union said in its statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
