     Aug. 2 (Bloomberg) --  Ghana’s  Tema Oil Refinery is in talks
with the central bank to waive a limit placed on its borrowing
from commercial banks to allow it to raise money to import
crude, the Daily Graphic reported.  The refinery needs the single-borrower limit of 16 million
cedis ($10.6 million) waived to pay for a shipment of 600,000
barrels of Nigerian crude that is waiting to be offloaded, the
Accra-based newspaper reported, without saying how it got the
information.  That would allow the Tema refinery to restart its crude-
distillation unit that has been shut down for the past week amid
a shortage of fuel, the paper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
