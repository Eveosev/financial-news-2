U.S. gasoline demand rose 0.1 percent
from the previous week as average pump prices rose for the
fourth straight week,  MasterCard Inc. (MA)  said.  Drivers bought 9.27 million barrels a day in the week ended
July 29, up from 9.26 million a week earlier, MasterCard said in
its weekly SpendingPulse report. Demand was down 3.1 percent
from a year earlier.  Averaged over four weeks, demand fell 1.9 percent. It was
the 19th consecutive week that the four-week average fell below
the previous year, said John Gamel, gasoline analyst for
SpendingPulse.  “For the last half of July, gasoline consumption has not
even been able to reach 65 million barrels per week,” Gamel
said. Last year’s demand at that time was near 67 million
barrels, he said.  Higher prices, hot weather and “uncertain economic
conditions” are reducing consumption this year, he said.  The average pump price rose 1 cent in the period ended July
29 from the prior week to $3.70 a gallon, up 36 percent from a
year earlier.  The report from Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is
assembled by MasterCard Advisors, the company’s consulting arm.
The information is based on credit-card swipes and cash and
check payments at about 140,000 U.S. gasoline stations.  Visa Inc. (V)  is the biggest payments network company by
transactions processed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
