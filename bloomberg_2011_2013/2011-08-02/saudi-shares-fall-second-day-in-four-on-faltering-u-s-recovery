Saudi Arabia ’s benchmark index fell
the second day in four on concern a slowdown in the U.S. may
derail global growth, and as crude  oil prices  fell.  Al Rajhi Bank (RJHI) , Saudi Arabia’s second-largest publicly
traded lender by assets, slipped a second day this week.  Saudi
Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the world’s biggest chemicals maker,
decreased 1.4 percent. The  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  declined 0.7
percent to 6,429.60, at 11:46 a.m. in  Riyadh .  “U.S. economic indicators continued to show that the
recovery may be stalling and global markets fell on that news,”
said Fuad Aghabi, a director at Ajeej Capital in Riyadh. “The
Saudi market is reacting to the uncertainty surrounding the
world economy with lower volumes typical of Ramadan trading.”  Emerging market and European stocks retreated after the
U.S. Institute for Supply Management’s factory index showed
manufacturing activity expanded in July at the slowest pace in
two years, coming in below the lowest estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index fell 1.2 percent
and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index declined 0.8 percent.  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  decreased 0.5 percent today,
suggesting U.S. stocks will fall at the open even after the
 House of Representatives  approved legislation to raise the debt
limit.  Crude oil for September delivery dropped as much 0.9
percent to $94.03 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
The six nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council supply about a
fifth of the world’s oil.  The Islamic holy month of Ramadan, when Muslims fast from
sunrise to sunset, started yesterday. About 24 million shares
traded on the Tadawul today, compared with a 12-month daily
average of 165 million shares, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Al Rajhi Bank dropped 0.3 percent to 72.25 riyals. Sabic
fell 1.4 percent to 103.75 riyals.  The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  slipped 0.3 percent. Oman’s
 MSM30 Index (MSM30)  decreased 0.2 percent, Bahrain’s gauge fell 0.6
percent and Qatar’s measure was little changed. In the United
Arab Emirates, Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  rose 0.1 percent while
 Abu Dhabi ’s measure gained less than 0.1 percent. The  Kuwait SE
Price Index (KWSEIDX)  rose 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
