Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) , the auto and
home lender that got a $17.2 billion government bailout, said
second-quarter net income fell 80 percent as mortgage operations
posted a loss.  Net income fell to $113 million in the second quarter from
$565 million a year earlier, the Detroit-based company said in a
statement today. The closely held company is 74 percent owned by
the U.S. government after at least three bailouts and has filed
with securities regulators to sell shares to the public.  Ally, run by former Citigroup Inc. executive  Michael Carpenter , 64, is among the largest U.S. mortgage originators
and servicers. The company’s mortgage operations posted a pretax
loss from continuing operations of $127 million in the second
quarter, compared with $230 million a year earlier.  “We continue to be vigilant in evaluating risks related to
our mortgage business and addressing them appropriately,”
Carpenter said today in the statement.  Pretax income from continuing operations in Ally’s North
American auto finance business was $559 million in the second
quarter, a 5.6 percent decline from the year-earlier period and
a 7.9 percent increase from the first quarter. The company’s
agreements with General Motors Co. and Chrysler Group LLC to
finance all their subsidized loans will phase out at the end of
2013.  Ally’s pretax income from continuing operations in the
mortgage origination and servicing unit dropped to $47 million
from $249 million in the same period a year earlier.  Net charge-offs fell to $121 million in the second quarter
from $307 million in the year-earlier period. Ally’s provision
for loan losses decreased 77 percent to $51 million from $218
million. The company’s Tier 1 common capital ratio was 8.4
percent in the second quarter, compared with 5.2 percent a year
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
