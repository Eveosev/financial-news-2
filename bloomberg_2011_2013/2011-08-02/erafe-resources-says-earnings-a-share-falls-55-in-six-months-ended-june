Merafe Resources Ltd. (MRF) , part-owner
with  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  of the world’s biggest ferrochrome producer,
said first-half profit fell 54 percent as higher costs and a
stronger South African currency eroded earnings.  Net income dropped to 86 million rand ($13 million), or 3.4
cents a share, from 188.7 million rand, or 7.6 cents, a year
earlier, the Johannesburg-based company said in a statement
today.  Production costs increased by 16 percent in rand terms
compared with a year earlier, Merafe said. The average
rand/dollar exchange rate was R6.90 in the first half, compared
with R7.53 in the first half of 2010, it said. Merafe shares,
down 36 percent this year, dropped 1.9 percent to 1.06 rand in
Johannesburg trading at 9:28 a.m.  Merafe’s share of sales from the venture with Xstrata fell
to 146,100 tons of ferrochrome in the first half from 148,400
metric tons a year earlier. Average European benchmark prices
for the stainless steel ingredient dropped to $1.185 a pound,
from $1.30 a year earlier, the company said.  Merafe, which is entitled to 20.5 percent of earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization from the
joint venture, said it expects stronger trading conditions
starting in the final three months of 2011.  “We expect seasonal demand improvement, stainless steel
restocking by distribution centers and ferrochrome restocking by
stainless steel producers resulting in improved trading
conditions during the fourth quarter of 2011 and into 2012,”
Merafe said.  Global ferrochrome use is expected to increase by 5 percent
this year, with Chinese demand projected to gain by 14 percent,
Merafe said.  The Merafe-Xstrata joint venture has an annual capacity of
1.98 million metric tons of ferrochrome output, produced by
smelting chromite ore, and contributes around 16 percent of
global supply, according to Merafe’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
