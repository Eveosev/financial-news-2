Coffee jumped the most in a week on
speculation that Tropical Storm Emily may hamper production of
arabica beans in Central America.  Emily was about 270 miles (435 kilometers) southeast of  San
Juan ,  Puerto Rico , according to an advisory issued by the U.S.
 National Hurricane Center  at 11 a.m. in Miami. Guatemala and
Honduras are among the world’s five-biggest arabica producers,
 according to  the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Brazil is the
top grower.  “Any kind of flooding rains in Central America may put
some pressure on those prices,”  Jimmy Tintle , an analyst at
Transworld Futures in Tampa, Florida, said in an e-mail.  Arabica coffee for September delivery climbed 1.85 cents,
or 0.8 percent, to settle at $2.432 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. That’s the biggest gain since July 26.  The price pared earlier gains of as much as 2.9 percent as
crop concerns eased. At least two computer forecast models
suggest Emily will dissipate near the island of Hispaniola,
where the countries of Haiti and the  Dominican Republic  are
located, according to the hurricane center.  In London, robusta-coffee futures gained on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
