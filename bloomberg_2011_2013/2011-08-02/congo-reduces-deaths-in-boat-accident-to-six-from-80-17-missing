Democratic Republic of Congo’s  Red
Cross  reduced the number of deaths in a boat accident last week
to six from 80, with 17 people still missing, said Gyna Bafala,
the organization’s secretary in Equateur Province.  A commercial boat was travelling down a tributary of the
Congo River near Ingende in Equateur on July 26 when it collided
with a convoy of small wooden boats, Bafala said by phone today
from Mbandaka, the provincial capital. He said that 123 people
survived the accident.  To contact the reporter on this story:
