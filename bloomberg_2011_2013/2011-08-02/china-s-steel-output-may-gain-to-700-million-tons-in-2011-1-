China ’s steel production may gain to
690 million metric tons to 700 million tons this year, the
Ministry of Industry and  Information Technology  said today in a
statement on its website.  Output levels in the second half may be lower than the
first six months as tightening credit, weaker demand, power
restrictions and shuttering of outdated plants reduces
production, according to the statement. The full-year output
level represents an increase of between 60 million and 70
million tons from last year, according to the statement.  Exports of steel products may be 45 million tons, it said,
without providing a comparison. That would represent a 5.7
percent increase compared with exports of 42.56 million tons
last year, according to Bloomberg News calculations based on
customs data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
