U.S. stock-index futures retreated,
indicating the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may fall for a
seventh day, amid concern the country’s economic recovery may be
faltering.  Futures on the  S&P 500  expiring in September slipped 0.4
percent to 1,275.2 at 4:08 p.m. in Hong Kong after rising as
much as 0.4 percent. September futures on the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  fell 32 points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,008.  Stocks in  Asia  tumbled, sending the MSCI Asia Pacific Index
to the biggest intraday slump in three weeks, after a report
showing the slowest U.S. manufacturing growth in two years
soured the earnings outlook for Asian exporters. The U.S.
Institute for Supply Management’s factory index fell to 50.9
last month, below even the lowest estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey, from 55.3 in June.  The world’s largest economy expanded at a  slower-than-
estimated 1.3 percent annual pace in the second quarter as
personal consumption also fell short of estimates, Commerce
Department reports on July 29 showed. Confidence among U.S.
consumers fell to the lowest in two years last month, according
to the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of
consumer sentiment, released the same day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
