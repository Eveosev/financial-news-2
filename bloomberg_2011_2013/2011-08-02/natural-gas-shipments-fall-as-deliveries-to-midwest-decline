Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. electricity generators dropped for the first time in three
days as shipments to the Northern Midwest declined.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to  power plants  in the
U.S. and Canada shows shipments fell 2.1 percent to 22.9 million
dekatherms (22.3 billion cubic feet) from 23.4 million
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Schedules
for 703 of 743 pipelines were reported as of 1 p.m. New York
time.  Scheduled shipments to power generators in the Northern
Midwest dropped 19 percent to 245,333 dekatherms, with reports
from 39 of 39 pipelines in the region.  Power plants use about 30 percent of the nationâ€™s gas
supplies, according to the Energy Department.  Wholesale gas for next-day delivery at the NGPL Midcon,
supplying the Trailblazer Pipeline at Gage, Nebraska, from
fields in Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas, gained 4.39 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $4.1888 per million British thermal units yesterday
on the  Intercontinental Exchange .  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
rose 2.25 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $4.2854 per million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
