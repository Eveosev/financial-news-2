Chile’s peso fell as U.S.  consumer
spending  dropped unexpectedly for the first time in two years
and copper prices slid for the second day in a row.  The peso decreased 0.4 percent to 458.83 pesos per  U.S.
dollar  at 1:31 p.m. New York time, from 456.85 yesterday.  “The U.S. data on income and personal spending came out
lower than expected, which is having a depreciative effect on
emerging-market currencies like the Chilean peso,” Raul Lopez,
head currency trader at Banco Penta, said in a phone interview
from Santiago. “Copper is also depreciating today, which is
adding to the pressure against the peso.”  Consumer spending in the U.S. dropped 0.2 percent in June
after rising 0.1 percent the month before, Commerce Department
figures showed today. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey
was for a gain of 0.1 percent. Incomes expanded at the slowest
pace since November and the savings rate rose.  Copper, which accounts for half of  Chile ’s exports, dropped
0.4 percent. It has tumbled 2 percent in the last two days.  Chile’s one-year interest-rate swap rate, which reflects
traders’ views of future rates, fell seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 5.48 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
