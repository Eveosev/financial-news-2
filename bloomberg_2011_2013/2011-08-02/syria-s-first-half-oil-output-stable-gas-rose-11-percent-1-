Syria , trying to halt a decline in
its oil production, pumped 0.2 percent more crude and 11 percent
more natural gas in the first half of 2011 compared with the
same period of last year, the Oil Ministry said.  Crude output averaged 387,250 barrels a day, up from
386,293 barrels a day in the first half of last year, the
ministry said today in an e-mailed statement. State-run
companies accounted for 36.7 million barrels, or about half, of
the total production and eight joint ventures the rest, it said.  Syria exported 27.8 million barrels of the crude produced
during the period and supplied its two state-owned refineries
with 43.7 million barrels, according to the statement.  Gas production rose to 5.48 billion cubic meters in the
first half, or 30.3 million cubic meters a day, up from 27.3
million cubic meters a day in the same period of 2010, it said.
Syria imported about 171 million cubic meters of natural gas
from  Egypt  in the first half, the ministry said.  Syria holds the ninth-largest oil reserves in the  Middle
East , according to data from BP Plc. Crude production peaked at
583,000 barrels a day in 1996. The country is seeking foreign
investment to help stabilize output this year at a rate of
386,000 barrels a day, Oil Minister Sufian Alao said on March
13. The government has asked companies to submit bids for three
offshore oil and gas concessions by Oct. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
