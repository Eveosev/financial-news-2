Ford Motor Co. (F)  said U.S. sales rose
less in July than analysts’ estimated, while  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) 
and Honda Motor Co. posted declines amid less consumer spending.  Ford light-vehicle sales rose 5.9 percent to 180,315
vehicles, the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker said today in a
statement. The results trailed six analysts’ average estimate
for a 7.6 percent gain. Toyota sales fell 23 percent to 130,802,
and Honda deliveries plunged 28 percent to 80,502.  A slump in hiring is hurting confidence and leading
consumers to retrench as vehicle inventories recover from the
March 11 tsunami in Japan that disrupted production and led to
vehicle shortages. July light-vehicle deliveries ran at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 12.2 million, trailing the
12.5 million pace through the first half, Autodata Corp. said.  “The industry constraints are dissipating, but the
economic constraints are stronger than what we thought,”  Paul Ballew , chief economist for Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co.,
said in a phone interview. “Even with inventories marginally
better, the selling rate looks comparable to June. For the
remainder of the year, we’re focused on what the heck is
happening from an underlying growth standpoint in the economy.”  The U.S. light-vehicle sales rate exceeded the 11.8 million
pace that was the average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  GM Gains  General Motors Co. (GM)  deliveries climbed 7.6 percent to
214,915, the Detroit-based automaker said today in a statement.
The results beat the 7 percent increase that was the average
estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Congressional debate over raising the $14.3 trillion U.S.
debt ceiling combined with gasoline prices above $3.50 a gallon
and limited supply of small vehicles in hindering total industry
sales,  Don Johnson , GM’s vice president of U.S. sales, said on a
conference call.  “The economy has clearly lost some momentum,” Johnson
said today. “We do believe that it will continue to recover,
but more gradually than we originally anticipated as we move
through the second half of the year.”  Consumer spending  in the U.S. unexpectedly dropped in June
for the first time in almost two years, Commerce Department
figures showed today in  Washington . Incomes grew at the slowest
pace since November and the savings rate climbed to the highest
since September.  GM and Ford have said that 2011 U.S. vehicle sales may be
at the low end of their forecast of 13 million to 13.5 million
vehicles, including medium- and heavy-duty trucks.  Full-Year Sales  IHS Automotive will lower its estimate for full-year U.S.
light-vehicle deliveries from 12.7 million,  Rebecca Lindland , an
analyst based in Lexington,  Massachusetts , said today in a
Bloomberg Television interview.  “We’re seeing consumers not have the confidence to
spend,” Lindland said. IHS will lower its estimate as soon as
tomorrow, she said in a telephone interview.  Employers added 18,000 jobs in June, the smallest gain in
nine months, as the U.S. unemployment rate rose to 9.2 percent,
the Labor Department said. The Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan index of consumer sentiment fell in July to 63.7, the
weakest since March 2009.  Chrysler Group LLC, the automaker majority owned by  Fiat
SpA (F) , said deliveries increased 20 percent to 112,026, beating
the 15 percent gain that was the average of four analysts’
estimates. Sales of Chrysler’s Jeep Grand Cherokee and Wrangler
sport-utility vehicles surged 76 percent and 43 percent,
respectively, the  Auburn Hills , Michigan-based company said.  Toyota Falls  Toyota sales of its Toyota, Lexus and Scion models were
better than an expected decline of 25 percent, the average
estimate of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Honda, the
Japanese automaker that relies most on sales to U.S. customers,
had a bigger decline than the 23 percent drop that was the
average of three analysts’ estimates.  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) ,  South Korea ’s largest automaker,
delivered 59,561 vehicles to U.S. customers in July, up 10
percent from a year ago, the company said in a statement.  Kia
Motors Corp. (000270) , Hyundai’s affiliate, sold 45,504 vehicles.  Combined volume for Hyundai and Kia, which are partner
companies that maintain separate operations in the U.S., totaled
105,065, trailing only GM, Ford, Toyota and Chrysler.  Nissan Motor Co., Japan’s second-biggest automaker, said
U.S. sales rose 2.7 percent to 84,601 cars and light trucks.
Deliveries for the Yokohama-based company were expected to be
little changed from a year earlier, according to the average of
three analysts’ estimates.  Second-Half Rebound  Industry sales will rebound in the second half as
availability of vehicles increases, said Alan Baum, a West
Bloomfield, Michigan-based industry consultant at Baum &
Associates. The improved supply, still recovering from the March
earthquake and tsunami in  Japan , will likely lead to lower
vehicle pricing late in the year, he said.  “The issue is going to be how aggressive Toyota and Honda
in particular are in terms of pricing and trying to get their
sales back in order,” Baum said today in a Bloomberg Television
interview.  Industrywide vehicle inventory climbed to 54 days’ supply
at the beginning of July, from 49 days in June, J.D. Power &
Associates said in a July 21  statement . Car inventory started
the month at a 43-day supply, with models such as Toyota’s Prius
and Honda’s Civic below 25 days, the  Westlake Village ,
California-based researcher said.  Cruze Supply  Deliveries of GM’s Chevrolet Cruze compact slipped 1
percent to 24,648 from June, when it was the industry’s best-
selling car. Cruze in July finished behind the Toyota Camry
sedan at 27,016. GM ended the month with about 28,000 Cruzes in
inventory, or about 30 days supply, Johnson said yesterday.  Sales of Ford’s Focus compact fell 3.4 percent to 14,889.
Inventory of the model is one-fourth of year-earlier levels,
said  George Pipas , the automaker’s sales analyst.  “Some of our dealers are literally selling them right off
the truck,”  Ken Czubay , Ford vice president of U.S. sales, said
on a conference call.  Ford’s 5.9 percent increase in sales reflects year-ago
deliveries of Volvo models. Ford has since sold the brand.  Jay Dunphy, president of Dunphy Motors, a Ford dealer in
Philadelphia, said last week his store had three Focus cars and
three Fiesta subcompacts in stock.  “We would love to be able to have about 15 of them each,”
Dunphy said in a telephone interview. “Ford has an accepted
product that is being bought by the public. The biggest problem
is availability.”  Truck Sales  Sales of Ford’s F-Series and GM’s Chevrolet Silverado
pickups, the two top-selling models in the industry, declined in
July. Silverado deliveries dropped 4.5 percent to 33,121, while
F-Series slipped 2.7 percent to 49,104.  Inventory of Silverado and GMC Sierra full-size trucks fell
to 115 days supply from 122 days at the end of June, Johnson
said today. The automaker is targeting 200,000 pickups, or 90
days supply, by the end of the year, he said.  GM may have to cut prices or production on trucks if demand
falls further, said  Itay Michaeli , a Citigroup Inc. analyst
based in  New York .  For now, “they seem to have dealer buy-in,” Michaeli said
in a phone interview. “If that changes, they will have to cut
production.”  GM fell $1.02, or 3.6 percent, to $27.05 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. Ford declined 50 cents,
or 4.1 percent, to $11.85.  July had 26 selling days, one fewer than a year earlier.  The U.S. averaged annual light-vehicle sales of 16.8
million vehicles from 2000 to 2007, according to researcher
Autodata Corp. Deliveries climbed to 11.6 million in 2010 from a
27-year low of 10.4 million in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
