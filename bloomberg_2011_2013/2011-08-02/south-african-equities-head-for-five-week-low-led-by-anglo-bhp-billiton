The FTSE/JSE  Africa  All Share Index
fell the most in two weeks, dropping 385.53, or 1.2 percent, to
30,871.78 by the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  Absa Group Ltd. (ASA)  , the South African bank controlled
by Barclays Plc, rose to its highest in more than a week,
gaining 1.06 rand, or 0.8 percent, to 134.01 rand. Net income

a statement today.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  , Africa’s largest gold
producer, rose for a second day, adding 4.62 rand, or 1.6
percent, to 290 rand. South African gold producers including
AngloGold,  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)   and Harmony Gold Mining Co.
(HAR SJ) signed a two-year wage agreement with unions, ending a
strike in the industry. Gold climbed to a record in  New York  and
 London  as concern that global economic growth may be slowing
boosted demand for the metal as a protection of wealth.  Gold Fields, the continent’s second-biggest producer,
advanced for a third day, adding 2.28 rand, or 2.2 percent, to
107.99 rand.  Harmony, Africa’s third-largest gold producer, climbed to

96.50 rand.  Exxaro Resources Ltd. (EXX)  , the biggest seller of coal
to South African power utility Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., fell the
most in two months, dropping 4.83 rand, or 2.6 percent, to

over plans by Exxaro Resources to close its Zincor refinery,
Department of Trade and Industry Minister  Rob Davies  said.  JSE Ltd. (JSE)  , the operator of Johannesburg’s stock
Exchange, closed at its highest in three weeks, advancing 1.95
rand, or 3 percent, to 68 rand. Earnings per share for the six
months to June 30 are expected to increase by between 17 percent
and 27 percent from a year earlier, the JSE said in a trading
statement.  Merafe Resources Ltd. (MRF)  , a ferrochrome mining
company, fell for the first time in four days, declining 2
cents, or 1.9 percent, to 1.06 rand. Profit retreated 54 percent
to 86 million rand for the six months to June compared with the
same period a year earlier, the group said today.  Old Mutual Plc (OML)  , South Africa’s largest insurer and
the third-biggest insurer in the U.K., closed at its lowest in
more than six months, dropping 37 cents, or 2.6 percent, to
13.65 rand. Old Mutual Property, the property asset-management
arm of Old Mutual, said it has decided against listing its
Triangle Real Estate Core Fund assets due to uncertain market
conditions.  Sasol Ltd. (SOL)  , the world’s largest maker of motor
fuel from coal, slipped 3.30 rand, or 1 percent, to 337 rand.
Oil declined for a third day in New York, the longest losing

biggest crude consumer, is slowing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
