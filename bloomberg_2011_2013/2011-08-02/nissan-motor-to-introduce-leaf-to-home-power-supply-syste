Nissan Motor  Co., maker of the all-
electric Leaf, will introduce a ‘Leaf to Home’ electricity power
supply system in Japan this fiscal year ending in March 2012.  Nissan’s Power Control System will allow electricity stored
in the Leaf’s battery to be distributed to ordinary households
and to charge home appliances, Hideaki Watanabe, the Yokohama-
based company’s head of zero-emission vehicles said today.  The company plans to introduce a total of seven electric
vehicle models in addition to the Leaf in the six years to
fiscal 2016. The automaker is targeting sales of 1.5 million
electric vehicles over the next six years along with its French
partner,  Renault SA. (RNO)   Nissan has sold about 11,000 Leafs globally as of mid-July,
after introducing the car in December.  Japan  sales were about
5,500 units, the company said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
