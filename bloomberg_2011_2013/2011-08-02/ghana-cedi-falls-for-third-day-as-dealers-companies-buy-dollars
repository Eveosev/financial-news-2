Ghana ’s cedi weakened for a third day
as dealers repurchased dollars sold before a bond auction last
week and companies sought the U.S. currency to import equipment,
according to Stanbic Bank Ghana Ltd.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
weakened to 1.5190 per dollar by 12:18 p.m. in Accra, the
capital, from a close yesterday of 1.5180, according to data
compiled by Stanbic Bank, the local unit of Standard Bank Group
Ltd.  “Dealers who sold dollars ahead of the bond auction,
thinking the sales will flood the market with dollars, bought
back the dollars today, since that did not happen,” said Chris Nettey, a currency trader at the bank.  Some investors who bought into the Bank of Ghana’s July 28
sale of five-year, cedi-denominated debt had already secured the
local currency to take part in the auction, he said by phone.
Telecommunications and manufacturing companies also sold cedis
to bring equipment and raw material into the West African
nation, Nettey said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
