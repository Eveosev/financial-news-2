IPR Mediterranean Exploration Ltd., a
unit of Texas-based Improved Petroleum Recovery Group of Cos.,
is drilling an evaluation well in eastern  Syria , the state-owned
General Petroleum Corp. said.  IPR started drilling the Karam-1 well on July 30, the
Damascus-based General Petroleum, which oversees the crude
industry in Syria, said today in a statement on its website.  The explorer has been producing oil in Syria since 2010
through Al Rasheed Petroleum Co., a joint venture with General
Petroleum, according to the statement.  Syria, which has been engulfed this year by protests
demanding political change, holds the ninth-largest oil reserves
in the  Middle East , according to data from BP Plc. Crude
production peaked at 596,000 barrels a day in 1995, and the
country will deplete existing oil reserves within 18 years,
according to calculations by BP Plc.  The Arab country is seeking foreign investment to help
stabilize output this year at a rate of 386,000 barrels a day,
Oil Minister Sufian Alao said on March 13. The Syrian government
has asked companies to submit bids for three offshore oil and
gas concessions by Oct. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
