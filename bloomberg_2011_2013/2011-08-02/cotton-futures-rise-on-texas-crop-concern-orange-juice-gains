Cotton rose to a three-week high as
persistent drought conditions devastated crops in  Texas , the
largest U.S. grower. Orange-juice futures advanced.  In the week ended July 31, about 57 percent of Texas cotton
crops were in poor or very poor condition, Department of
Agriculture  data  show. Prices touched a 10-month low last week
partly on bets that Tropical Storm Don would bring beneficial
rain. The storm “did not bring any measurable rain” and “the
ground is still bald and scorched,” Mile Gibbs, an agent for
Texas AgriLife Extension Service, said in an e-mailed report.  “We’re still looking at a pretty big problem,”  Jack Scoville , a commodity analyst at Price Futures Group Inc. in
 Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “No relief from the
drought appears likely this week after the tropical storm from
last week did little good.”  Cotton for December delivery gained 1.8 cents, or 1.7
percent, to settle at $1.0685 a pound at 2:38 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York . Earlier, the fiber touched $1.0862,
the highest since July 14.  Orange-juice futures for September delivery rose 0.95 cent,
or 0.5 percent, to settle at $2.0165 a pound on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
