Parker Hannifin Corp. (PH) , the maker of
fluid power systems and air-conditioning products, tumbled after
forecasting lower profit in fiscal 2012 than some analysts
estimate.  Parker Hannifin’s profit prediction of $6.70 to $7.50 per
share has a midpoint of $7.10, trailing the $7.50 average of 15
estimates in a Bloomberg survey. The Cleveland, Ohio-based
company said its outlook reflects the potential for broader
economic trends to pull growth rates below 10 percent in the
second half of the year.  “When we go into a fiscal year, you know, we budget
tight,” Chief Executive Officer Don Washkewicz told investors
and analysts on an earnings conference call. “We don’t want all
the operations spending as if we’re running at the top end of
our guidance or anything like that. We can always adjust budgets
as we go through the year.”  Parker Hannifin slid $4.86, or 6.3 percent, to $72.60, at
1:22 p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares earlier dropped as much as 8.7 percent to $70.70, the
largest intraday decline since May 2010.  Profit in the three months through June climbed 32 percent
to $292.2 million, or $1.79 a share, the company said in a
statement. That trailed an average estimate of $1.80 and
included 14 cents a share from a lower  tax rate  and 4 cents from
fewer shares following a buyback, said Stephen Volkmann, a New
York-based analyst with Jefferies Group Inc.  “Shares could be off this morning as the in-line earnings
results were supplemented by 18 cents of unexpected benefit,”
Volkmann, who has a “hold” rating on the shares, wrote in a
note to clients today. “Margins in all four segments fell short
of our expectations.”  The profit margin of 11.9 percent before interest and taxes
trailed Jefferies’ projection of 13.3 percent, Volkmann wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
