General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP) , the
second-largest U.S. mall operator, plans to spin off 30 of its
malls to shareholders through a special dividend.  General Growth will issue the dividend in the form of
common stock in Rouse Properties Inc., a recently formed company
into which General Growth will transfer the shopping centers,
the Chicago-based company said in a media release.  The group, which came out of bankruptcy in November, has
sold about $300 million of properties since then, has another
$387 million under contract for sale, and plans to dispose of
another $350 million of assets by the end of this year, Chief
Executive Officer Sandeep Mathrani said on June 9. The spin-off
was one of the options considered for the properties, the group
said in a statement distributed through PR Newswire.  The transaction “enables General Growth shareholders to
participate in Rouse’s significant growth potential as a
standalone entity and efficiently streamlines General Growth
into a highly focused, premier mall operator,” Mathrani said in
the statement.  The distribution will be made on a pro-rata basis to
holders of General Growth common stock on the dividend record
date in the fourth quarter, the company said. The properties in
Rouse, which accounts for about 7 percent of General Growth’s
net operating income, are about 87.7 percent leased, the group
said.  Rouse will be listed on the New York stock exchange as a
real estate investment trust, General Growth said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
