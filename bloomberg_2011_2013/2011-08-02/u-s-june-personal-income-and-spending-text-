Following is the text of the U.S. disposition of
personal income from the U.S. personal income  Personal income increased $18.7 billion, or 0.1 percent, and disposable personal
income (DPI) increased $16.3 billion, or 0.1 percent, in?June, according to the
 Bureau of Economic Analysis . Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) decreased
$21.9 billion, or 0.2 percent.  In May, personal income increased $23.2 billion,
or 0.2 percent, DPI increased $17.6 billion, or 0.2 percent, and PCE increased
$5.9 billion, or 0.1 percent, based on revised estimates.  Real disposable income increased 0.3 percent in June, in contrast to a decrease
of less than 0.1 percent in May.  Real PCE decreased less than 0.1  percent,
compared with a decrease of 0.1 percent.  Wages and salaries  Private wage and salary disbursements decreased $2.2 billion in June, in
contrast to an increase of $15.0 billion in May. Goods-producing industries'
payrolls decreased $1.8 billion, in contrast to an increase of $4.8 billion;
manufacturing payrolls decreased $2.1 billion, in contrast to an increase of
$4.1 billion.  Services-producing industries' payrolls decreased $0.3 billion,
in contrast to an increase of $10.1 billion.  Government wage and salary
disbursements decreased $0.4 billion, compared with a decrease of $0.5 billion.  Other personal income  Supplements to wages and salaries increased $1.5 billion in June, compared with
an increase of $2.8 billion in May.  Proprietors' income decreased $0.8 billion in June, in contrast to an increase
of $0.6 billion in May.  Farm proprietors' income decreased $0.5 billion, the
same decrease as in May.  Nonfarm proprietors' income decreased $0.3 billion in
June, in contrast to an increase of $1.1 billion in May.  Rental income of persons decreased $1.2 billion in June, compared with a
decrease of $1.3 billion in May. Personal income receipts on assets (personal
interest income plus personal dividend income) increased $12.0 billion, compared
with an increase of $10.1 billion.  Personal current transfer receipts increased
$9.5 billion, in contrast to a decrease of $1.4 billion.  Changes in personal
current transfer receipts reflect the effects of unemployment compensation
legislation.  Contributions for government social insurance -- a subtraction in calculating
personal income -- decreased $0.2 billion in June, in contrast to an increase of
$2.2 billion in May.  Personal current taxes and disposable personal
income  Personal current taxes increased $2.3 billion in June, compared with an increase
of $5.6 billion in May. Disposable personal income (DPI) -- personal income less
personal current taxes -- increased $16.3 billion, or 0.1 percent, in June,
compared with an increase of $17.6 billion, or 0.2 percent in May.  Personal outlays and personal saving  Personal outlays -- PCE, personal interest payments, and personal current
transfer payments -- decreased $22.6 billion in?June, in contrast to an increase
of $5.3 billion in May.  PCE decreased $21.9 billion, in contrast to an increase
of $5.9 billion.  Personal saving -- DPI less personal outlays -- was $620.6 billion in June,
compared with $581.7 billion in May.  Personal saving as a percentage of
disposable personal income was 5.4 percent in June, compared with 5.0 percent in
May.  For a comparison of personal saving in BEAÆs national income and product
accounts with personal saving in the Federal Reserve BoardÆs flow of funds
accounts and data on changes in net worth, go to

June, in contrast to a decrease of less than 0.1 percent in May.  Real PCE -- PCE adjusted to remove price changes -- decreased less than 0.1
percent in June, compared with a decrease of 0.1 percent in May. Purchases of
durable goods decreased 0.6 percent, compared with a decrease of 1.4 percent.
Purchases of motor vehicles and parts accounted for most of the decrease in June
and in May.  Purchases of nondurable goods increased 0.2 percent in June, in
contrast to a decrease of 0.3 percent in May.  Purchases of services decreased
less than 0.1 percent, in contrast to an increase of 0.2 percent.  PCE price index -- The price index for PCE decreased 0.2 percent in June, in
contrast to an increase of 0.2 percent in May.  The PCE price index, excluding
food and energy, increased 0.1 percent, compared with an increase of 0.2
percent.  Revisions of the Personal Income and Outlays
Estimates  The revised estimates of personal income, personal outlays, DPI, and personal
saving reflect the results of the annual revision of the national income and
product accounts (NIPAs).  In addition to the regular revision of estimates for
the most recent 3 years and the first 5 months of 2011, this ôflexibleüEannual
revision results in revisions to current-dollar personal outlays and personal
saving back to January 2003.  The reference year remains 2005.  In cases for
which the estimates for the reference year (2005) are revised, this results in
revisions to the levels of the related index numbers and chained-dollar
estimates for the entire historical period; revisions to percent changes before
the first quarter of 2003 are small.  Annual revisions, which are usually
released in July, incorporate newly available and more comprehensive source
data, as well as improved methodologies.  In this annual revision, the notable
revisions primarily reflect the incorporation of newly available and revised
source data.  Revised annual estimates of personal income and outlays for 2008-2010 are shown
in table 12.  Revised and previously published monthly estimates of personal
income, DPI, PCE, personal saving as a percentage of DPI, real DPI, and real PCE
are shown in table 13; revised and previously published annual and quarterly
estimates are shown in table 14.  Personal income was revised up $69.1 billion, or 0.6 percent, for 2008; was
revised down $244.7 billion, or 2.0 percent, for 2009; and was revised down
$167.5 billion, or 1.3 percent, for 2010.  For 2008, upward revisions to
personal interest income, to supplements to wages and salaries, and to rental
income of persons were partly offset by downward revisions to personal dividend
income, to wages and salaries, and to nonfarm proprietorsüEincome.  For 2009,
downward revisions to personal interest income, to personal dividend income, and
to nonfarm proprietorsüEincome were partly offset by upward revisions to rental
income of persons and to farm proprietorsüEincome.  For 2010, downward revisions
to personal interest income, to nonfarm proprietorsüEincome, to supplements to
wages and salaries, and to personal current transfer receipts were partly offset
by upward revisions to rental income of persons, to wages and salaries, and to
farm proprietorsüEincome.  Disposable personal income (DPI) (personal income less personal current taxes)
was revised up $71.6 billion, or 0.7 percent, for 2008;  was revised down $246.1
billion, or 2.2 percent, for 2009; and was revised down $195.0 billion, or 1.7
percent, for 2010.  Personal current taxes was revised down $2.5 billion for
2008, was revised up $1.4 billion for 2009, and was revised up $27.6 billion for
2010.  The percent change from the preceding year in real DPI was revised up
from 1.7 percent to 2.4 percent for 2008, was revised down from an increase of
0.6 percent to a decrease of 2.3 percent for 2009, and was revised up from an
increase of 1.4 percent to an increase of 1.8 percent for 2010.  Personal outlays -- PCE, personal interest payments, and personal current
transfer payments -- was revised down for all 3 years:  $72.8 billion for 2008,
$143.3 billion for 2009, and $133.8 billion for 2010. For all 3 years, downward
revisions to PCE accounted for most of the revisions to personal outlays.  The personal saving rate (personal saving as a percentage of DPI) was revised up
from 4.1 percent to 5.4 percent for 2008, was revised down from 5.9 percent to
5.1 percent for 2009, and was revised down from 5.7 percent to 5.3 percent for
2010.  For the earlier period 2004-2007, PCE was revised down for all 4 years: $14.5
billion for 2004, $15.5 billion for 2005, $21.7 billion for 2006, and $34.0
billion for 2007.  The personal saving rate was revised up from 3.4 percent to
3.6 percent for 2004, was revised up from 1.4 percent to 1.5 percent for 2005,
was revised up from 2.4 percent to 2.6 percent for 2006, and was revised up from
2.1 percent to 2.4 percent for 2007.  (For 2003, PCE was revised up by less than
$1 billion, and the personal saving rate was unrevised.)  NOTE.  BEA acknowledges the special efforts by the Bureau of Labor Statistics
with the assistance of 16 state employment offices in providing preliminary data
for the first quarter of 2011 from the quarterly census of employment and wages.
Wage and salary data from the state employment offices of  California ,  Colorado ,
 Connecticut ,  Delaware ,  Florida ,  Illinois ,  Kansas ,  Massachusetts ,  Missouri ,  New
Mexico ,  North Carolina ,  New Jersey ,  New York ,  Ohio ,  Pennsylvania , and Texas were
provided.  These data should greatly improve the estimates of wages and
salaries.  Annual Revision of the National Income and
Product Accounts  The estimates released today reflect the results of the annual revision of the
national income and product accounts (NIPAs).  In addition to the regular
revision of estimates for the most recent 3 years and through May 2011, current-
dollar personal income and outlays and some components are revised back to
January 2003. In cases for which the estimates for the reference year (2005) are
revised, this results in revisions to the levels of the related index numbers
and chained-dollar estimates for the entire historical period; revision to
percent changes before January 2003 are small.  Annual revisions, which are
usually released in July, incorporate source data that are more complete, more
detailed, and otherwise more reliable than those previously available.  This
release includes the revised monthly estimates of personal income and personal
outlays and provides an overview of the results of the revision.abc  123 abc  123 abc  SOURCE: U.S. Commerce Department.     http://www.bea.gov   To contact the reporter on this story: Alex Tanzi in Washington at
