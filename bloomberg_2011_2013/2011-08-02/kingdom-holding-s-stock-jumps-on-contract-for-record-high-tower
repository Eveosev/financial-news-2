Kingdom Holding Co. (KINGDOM)  rose to a one-
month high in Riyadh trading after billionaire owner Prince Alwaleed bin Talal awarded Saudi Binladin Group a contract to
build the world’s tallest skyscraper for the company.  Kingdom rose as much as 3.2 percent to 8.10 riyals, the
highest intraday price since July 3, and was up 1.9 percent as
of 12:40 p.m.  The investment company’s planned tower, in the Saudi port
city of Jeddah, will have a height exceeding 1,000 meters (3,300
feet) and cost 4.6 billion riyals ($1.2 billion) to construct,
Kingdom Holding said in a statement today.  The 828-meter Burj Khalifa in Dubai is currently the
world’s tallest skyscraper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
