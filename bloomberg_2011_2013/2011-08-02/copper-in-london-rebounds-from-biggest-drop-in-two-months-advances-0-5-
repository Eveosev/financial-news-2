Copper in  London  advanced 0.5 percent
to $9,695 a metric ton, rebounding from a drop by the most in
two months yesterday.  Three-month delivery copper on the London Metal Exchange
yesterday dropped 1.8 percent to $9,650, the most since June 2,
after a report showed manufacturing slowed more than economists
estimated in the U.S., the worldâ€™s second-biggest user of the
metal.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
