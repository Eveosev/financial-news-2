AT&T Inc. (T) ’s proposed $39 billion
purchase of T-Mobile USA Inc. has benefits that should be
carefully considered by authorities reviewing the transaction,
 Lamar Smith , chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives’
Judiciary Committee, said in a letter to federal regulators.  There’s “at least as much evidence” in support of the
deal as against it, Smith, a Republican from Texas, said in an
Aug. 1 letter to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and Federal
Communications Chairman Julius Genachowski. The merger could
“improve mobile service for my constituents and others
throughout the nation,” Smith wrote in the letter, a copy of
which was obtained by Bloomberg News.  Last month, Senators  Herb Kohl  and  Al Franken  urged the FCC
and the  Justice Department  to block the transaction. Franken
said the deal would raise prices for consumers, cost
“thousands” of jobs and stifle innovation in a letter to both
agencies on July 26. Kohl said in a July 20 letter the agencies
should block the merger because it would harm competition and
consumers.  “Unfortunately, they provided you with only one side of
the story,” Smith wrote.  Smith urged the agencies to “carefully weigh all of the
evidence, including the many benefits of this transaction,
before coming to a conclusion.”  Franken, a Minnesota Democrat, is a member of the Judiciary
Committee that oversees the Justice Department. Kohl, a
Wisconsin Democrat, is the chairman of the panel’s antitrust
subcommittee. The House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on
the proposed AT&T-T-Mobile merger May 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
