John Taylor , founder of the world’s
largest currency-hedge fund, said the dollar will remain the
world’s reserve currency even if the U.S. loses its AAA credit
rating.  There is “no alternative for the dollar in the next five
to 10 years,” Taylor said in an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s “In the Loop” with Betty Liu. The euro is
diminished by the region’s economic woes and few investors see
the yuan of communist  China  as a viable alternative, he said.  FX Concepts is “beginning to like the dollar,” Taylor
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
