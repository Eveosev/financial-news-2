Cocoa production in  Ivory Coast , the
world’s largest grower, may be at least 1.6 million metric tons
this season, according to Eric Sivry of Marex Spectron Group.  Bean deliveries to ports in the West African country were
1.35 million tons since Oct. 1 to July 24, up 25 percent from a
year earlier, according to a document from the Bourse du Cafe et
du Cacao. Cocoa prices in London have dropped 8.1 percent this
year as West African cocoa production expanded.  “With arrival data now showing 1.35 million metric tons so
far, the total Ivorian tree crop cannot be anything less than
1.6 million metric tons for 2010-11,” Sivry, Marex’s head of 
the agricultural options brokerage, said in an e-mail today.
“Analysts and traders tend to see ever growing production
for the current season and declining production numbers for
2011-12,” he said.  Marex estimated on July 6 that Ivory Coast production would
be 1.48 million tons for this season and 1.35 million for 2011-
12, compared with 1.24 million in 2009-10. Global cocoa supplies
will outpace demand by 292,000 tons in the current season,
according to Rabobank International.   The Ivory Coast's record production was 1.4 million tons 
in 2005-06, according to the International Cocoa Organization
in  London .    To contact the reporter on this story:
