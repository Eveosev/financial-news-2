The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment increased,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index advanced 3 basis points
to 119 basis points as of 10:28 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking
Corp. prices show. The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50
investment-grade borrowers outside  Japan  rose 2 basis points to
116.5 as of 8:26 a.m. in Singapore, Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 118.5
basis points as of 9:26 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices
show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 of a percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
