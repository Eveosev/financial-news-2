Brazilian drugstore  Drogasil SA (DROG3) 
approved the incorporation of  Raia SA (RAIA3)  to form Raia Drogasil SA.  Raia shareholders will receive 2.29 Drogasil common shares
for each Raia share, and Drogasil holders will hold 57 percent
of the new company, according to a regulatory filing.  The merger would create Brazilâ€™s largest drugstore chain
with 696 stores in eight states and 8.4 percent of the market,
wrote Fabio Monteiro, an analyst at Banco BTG Pactual, said in
an investor report last month. Sales for the two companies were
a combined 4.2 billion reais ($2.7 billion) last year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
