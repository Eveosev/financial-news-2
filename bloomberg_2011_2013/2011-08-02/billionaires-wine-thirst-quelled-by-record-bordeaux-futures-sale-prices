Surging demand for Chateau Lafite and
other French trophy labels, especially from Asia, has pushed
both prices at auction and wine futures to records. Not all wine
dealers are happy.  The prices for some of the most expensive bottles are
starting to discourage even billionaire collectors, said dealers
-- some of whom had warned in January of a bubble that could
burst in 2011. Chinese and other buyers balked as some Bordeaux
producers raised prices as much as 80 percent last month for the
new vintage offered “en primeur,” when it is still in barrels.  “En primeur sales have halved,” Simon Staples, fine wine
and marketing director of the London-based merchants  Berry Bros
& Rudd , said in an interview. “It’s a combination of high
prices and the fact that the chateaux released less than last
year.”  Sales growth is also slowing at auctions. Takings at the
biggest three wine auction houses in the first six months of
2011 were up by 46 percent on the same period in 2010, according
to Bloomberg calculations, down from the 88 percent sales
increase in 2010.  The  Liv-ex  Fine Wine 50 index, tracking daily price
movements of the 10 most recent vintages of Bordeaux’s five
First Growth chateaux, declined from 445.49 points on July 1 to
433.51 points on  Aug. 2 . The London-based index, based on trade
sales, rose 136.67 points to 401.11 last year.  The future sale prices were boosted by scores of more than
90 for the vintage from the critic  Robert Parker .  Futures Increase  Chateau Latour  2010 was released at 780 euros ($1,106) a
bottle, a 30 percent increase on the also highly rated 2009
vintage.  Chateau Ausone  was pitched at 1,120 euros a bottle, 17
percent higher than last year. The 108 euros being charged for
bottles of  Carruades de Lafite  -- the second wine of Chateau
Lafite -- was a 59 percent increase.  Last year, Asian buyers snapped up a third of the Berry
Bros. Bordeaux 2009 futures allocation. Only 5 percent of the
merchant’s 2010 wines have gone to the region, Staples said.  “The 2009 vintage was the first that attracted a lot of
Chinese en primeur investment,” said Staples. “They’ve seen it
has really increased in value and have been put off by the
prices of the 2010s. If it isn’t in a bottle, they can’t show it
off to their friends.”  Chinese consumers continue to spend millions on older
vintages in bottles at specialist auctions.  Sotheby’s (BID) ,
Christie’s International and  Acker, Merrall & Condit  took a
record $258.3 million in wine sales in 2010, more than double
2009. About two-thirds of the most expensive lots were selling
to Asian bidders, according to both Christie’s and Acker.  Auctions Increase  Sotheby’s and Christie’s raised $53 million and 28.7
million pounds ($47.1 million) at wine sales in the first half
of 2011, increases of 49.3 percent and 120 percent respectively.
Acker took $54.8 million, up 10.4 percent. The total for all
three, about $155 million, compares with $106 million a year
ago.  Growth for all three companies was primarily driven by
sales in Hong Kong. Sotheby’s HK$96.8-million “Ultimate
Cellar” auction on April 2 was the New York-based company’s
15th straight 100 percent-successful “white glove” sale in the
region.  Hong Kong   “The market has continued to grow because we’ve had some
unbelievable collections to sell in Hong Kong,”  Serena Sutcliffe , Sotheby’s worldwide head of wine, said in an
interview. “Some individual prices have come down. Lafite has
leveled out. It couldn’t continue to rise with every sale. Now
buyers are looking at other chateaux and they’ve begun to close
the gap.”  In October 2010, a 12-bottle case of Lafite’s 1982 vintage,
sourced directly from the chateau, sold for HK$1 million
($128,000) at Sotheby’s Hong Kong. The wine fetched HK$605,000 a
case at the same auction venue in April.  By contrast, Chateau Mouton-Rothschild ‘82 fetched
HK$169,400 a case at Sotheby’s Andrew Lloyd Webber Wine
Collection auction in January. The price in Hong Kong climbed to
HK$217,800 in April at Sotheby’s “Ultimate Cellar” sale.  John Kapon, chief executive of Acker, believes the
problematic 2010 futures campaign will drive Chinese buyers back
into the auction market.  “Bordeaux has scared off  Asia  just as it was coming to the
table,” Kapon said in an interview. “People from that region
will notice they can get three bottles of 1995 Bordeaux for the
price of one bottle of 2010. They don’t like paying for things
and having to wait years to get them.”  Record Bottle  The French collector and restaurateur Christian Vanneque
had to wait six months to take possession of a bottle of 1811
Chateau d’Yquem for which he paid a record 75,000 pounds
($122,070).  The price, paid in a private sale brokered in January by
the London-based  Antique Wine Company , was the highest for a
bottle of white wine, according to the Guinness Book of Records.  The 200-year-old sweet Sauternes was handed over at a
ceremony in the Ritz hotel in  London  on July 26. It will be put
on display at Vanneque’s new restaurant, SIP Sunset Grill in
Bali,  Indonesia , the Antique Wine Company said in an e-mailed
statement.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
