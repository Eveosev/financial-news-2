The pound fell to the lowest level in
almost two weeks against the dollar and gilt yields slid to a
record after data showed U.K. construction weakened amid
mounting concern U.S. spending cuts may stifle global growth.  Sterling depreciated to an all-time low against the Swiss
franc. A gauge of British building activity slipped to 53.5 from
53.6 in June, Markit Economics Ltd. and the  Chartered Institute
of Purchasing and Supply  said today. Manufacturing unexpectedly
shrank the most in more than two years last month a report
yesterday showed.  “We are finally seeing the gloomy state of U.K.
fundamentals,” said Jane Foley, a senior foreign-exchange
strategist at Rabobank International in  London . “The pound
benefited before from the dual crisis in the U.S. and euro area
as the best of a bad bunch. The market is now reacting to the
weaker manufacturing data.”  The pound was little changed at $1.6281 as of 4:27 p.m. in
London. It dropped 0.4 percent to $1.6225 earlier, the lowest
level since July 21. The British currency weakened as much as
1.8 percent to 1.2546 Swiss francs. Sterling strengthened 0.2
percent to 87.26 pence per euro.  A gauge of U.K. factory output fell to 49.1, the lowest
level since June 2009, from 51.4 the previous month, a report by
 Markit Economics  and CIPS showed yesterday.  The  Confederation of British Industry  cut its growth
forecast for the U.K. economy yesterday after gross domestic
product barely grew in the second quarter. The U.K. will expand
1.3 percent this year, compared with an estimate of 1.7 percent
in May, the country’s biggest employers’ group said in a
quarterly forecast. The CBI’s growth prediction for 2012 is
unchanged at 2.2 percent.  U.S. Vote  The U.S. House of Representatives yesterday voted to
approve measures that threaten automatic reductions to enforce a
goal of cutting spending by $2.4 trillion over the next decade.  Sterling has fallen 9 percent in the last 12 months, making
it the second-worst performer among 10 developed-market
currencies, after the  U.S. dollar , according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes.  The 10-year gilt yield fell three basis points to 2.78
percent, after reaching a record low of 2.76 percent. The 3.75
percent security due September 2020 rose 0.23, or 2.3 pounds per
1,000-pound ($1,628) face amount, to 107.775. The two-year gilt
yield rose two basis points to 0.63 percent, after falling to
0.59 percent, the least since Oct. 22.  Growth Concern  “Ten-year yields reached record levels on concerns over
the outlook for growth,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income
strategist at RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh. “We had
disappointing U.K. and U.S. manufacturing surveys yesterday,
adding to nervousness about the global economy. Investors remain
nervous towards equities, choosing the safe haven of  government
bonds , including gilts.”  Manufacturing in the U.S. almost stalled in July,
threatening to deprive the two-year recovery of one of its main
drivers. The  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index
slumped to 50.9, the lowest since July 2009, from 55.3 a month
earlier, the Tempe, Arizona-based group said yesterday. The July
index was lower than the most pessimistic forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Gilts have handed investors 5.7 percent this year, compared
with 3.4 percent for German bunds and 4.6 percent for U.S.
Treasuries, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  Bond Auctions  The U.K. Debt Management Office sold 2 billion pounds of
4.5 percent gilts maturing in September 2034 at an average yield
of 3.955 percent today.  Investors bid for 2.23 times the amount offered, agency
data showed. That compares with a so-called bid-to-cover ratio
of 1.53 at the previous auction of the same securities held Nov.
11, which were sold at an average yield of 4.194 percent.  The debt office said it plans to sell 825 million pounds of
index-linked gilts due in November 2042 on Aug. 11.  Bank of England  policy makers meet to set  interest rates  in
two days. They will keep the benchmark rate unchanged at 0.5
percent, according to all 55 economists in a Bloomberg survey.
The Bank of England will probably hold its bond-purchase program
at 200 billion pounds, according to a separate survey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
