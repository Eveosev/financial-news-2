Serbia  urged the European Union and
North Atlantic Treaty Organization missions in  Kosovo  to start
talks with the Serbian government to ease tensions and restore
dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade.  “Representatives of the international community must
remain neutral and must not take sides, which they do by
refusing to talk to legitimate representatives of the Republic
of Serbia and by blocking food convoys, which can lead to a
humanitarian catastrophe,” Prime Minister  Mirko Cvetkovic  said
in an e-mailed statement.  The statement was issued a day after Serbia’s chief
negotiator for Kosovo Borislav Stefanovic and Kosovo Minister
Goran Bogdanovic held inconclusive talks with EU mediator Robert
Cooper, and made no public statements.  Cvetkovic on Saturday urged the  United Nations  and the EU
to keep maintaining peace in Kosovo and resist “provocations”
aimed at forcing Serb recognition of Kosovo’s unilateral
declaration of independence.  Serbia holds Kosovo responsible for the latest tensions,
sparked by Pristina’s decision to impose a trade embargo on
Serbian goods on July 25 and station special police at two
border crossings in the north to force Serb recognition of
Kosovo’s customs stamps. While 90 percent of Kosovo’s population
is made up of ethnic Albanians, most people in the northern part
are Serbs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
