German bonds rose, driving the 10-
year yield to an eight-month low, on concern spending cuts
included in a U.S. debt-limit compromise agreement will harm
global economic growth.  Bunds rose for an eight day after the U.S. House of
Representatives yesterday voted to approve measures that will
raise the national debt limit enough to fund the government
until 2013 and threatens automatic spending reductions to
enforce a goal of cutting $2.4 trillion over the next decade.
European producer-price inflation slowed to 5.9 percent from a
year earlier, according to the median of 20 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey before the data.  Belgium  is scheduled to
auction as much as 2.8 billion euros ($4 billion) of 105- and
168-day bills.  Ten-year bund yields fell two basis points to 2.43 percent
as of 7:56 a.m. in London. The 3.25 percent security maturing in
July 2021 rose 0.2, or 2 euros per 1,000-euro face amount to
107.12. Yields on two-year notes were four basis points lower at
1.06 percent.  German  government bonds  handed investors 3.4 percent this
year, compared with 4.6 percent for U.S. Treasuries, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Greek bonds have lost 11 percent,
while  Portugal â€™s have declined 22 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
