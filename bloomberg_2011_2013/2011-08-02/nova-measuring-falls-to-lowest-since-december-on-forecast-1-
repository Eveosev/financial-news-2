Nova Measuring Instruments Ltd. (NVMI) 
tumbled to the lowest level since December after the maker of
measuring instruments for the semiconductor manufacturing
industry forecast lower second-half revenue.  The shares retreated 7 percent to 28.14 shekels at the 4:30
p.m. close in Tel Aviv, the lowest since Dec. 20.  “Industry-wide, the pace of business began to slow
somewhat in the second quarter, after extremely aggressive
 capital spending  early in the first half of the year,” Gabi Seligsohn, Nova’s president and chief executive officer, said
today in a  statement to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange . “Given the
continued strong end market demand, we believe this is a mid-
cycle correction related to absorption and inventory
realignment, which should result in lower revenues during the
second half.”  Nova said it expects third-quarter revenue of $24 million
to $27 million with net profitability of 20 percent to 25
percent. Second-quarter revenue jumped 53 percent to $29.6
million and net income almost doubled to $9.2 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
