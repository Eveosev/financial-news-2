Record highs will be set across the
U.S. South this week and hot weather may linger through mid-
August, according to  Matt Rogers , president of  Commodity Weather
Group  LLC.  His forecast calls for the heat across the eastern half of
the country to retreat and center on the southeast from Aug. 7
to Aug. 16. The hottest weather is expected over northern  Texas ,
Oklahoma and western  Arkansas .  “The bigger heat story continues to be in the deep South
and Texas, where records are expected to continue falling this
week with more moderate to much-above-normal temperatures
frequently over the next two weeks,” Rogers said today in a
note to client.  Excessive heat warnings and watches, meaning the
combination of high temperatures and humidity may make it feel
as warm as 116 degrees Fahrenheit (47 Celsius), extend from  Iowa 
to Texas and eastward to Tennessee, according to the National
Weather Service.  A high of 107 degrees set a record in Dallas yesterday,
breaking the old mark of 106 set in 1998, according to the
weather service. Today’s high may reach 109 and the temperature
may touch above 105 for the rest of the week.  MDA EartSat Weather predicts the high temperature in Dallas
will remain above 100 until at least Aug. 11 and Houston will
flirt with 100-degree highs through the same timeframe, with six
of the next 10 days reaching highs of 100 degrees or more.  A daily record of 111 degrees was set in Fort Smith,
Arkansas, which also extended its record for consecutive 100-
degree days to 28. The prior record of 17 days was set in 1934.  The high in  St. Louis  is expected to be 103 degrees, 96 in
 Chicago , 110 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, 99 in Houston, and 100 in
Memphis, according to the weather service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
