Eisai Co., the Japanese maker of
Aricept, the world’s best-selling treatment for  Alzheimer’s
disease , reported a 28 percent drop in first-quarter profit
because of slumping demand for the pill.  Net income fell to 13.5 billion yen ($174 million), or 47.4
yen a share, in the three months ended June 30, from 18.8
billion yen, or 65.9 yen a share, a year earlier, Eisai said in
a statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange today. Sales declined 18
percent to 167.3 billion yen, the Tokyo-based company said.  Aricept, which accounted for 38 percent of Eisai’s revenue
last fiscal year, has faced competition from cheaper generic
versions in the U.S. since November. Sales in the latest period
plunged 49 percent to 42 billion yen, Eisai said today.  Eisai advanced 0.6 percent to 3,195 yen at the 3 p.m. close
in  Tokyo , while the benchmark Topix index declined 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
