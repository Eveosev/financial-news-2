South African borrowing costs may
increase because of a worsening euro-zone debt crisis given
large holdings of rand-denominated debt by European investors,
Reuters reported, citing National Treasury Director-General
Lungisa Fuzile.  About 35 percent of outstanding rand bonds were recently
held within the euro-zone area, the  news agency  cited Fuzile as
saying in an interview published in the Johannesburg-based
Business Report today. The Treasury was keeping its target of
issuing 135 billion rand in the domestic market this year and
wouldn’t issue more foreign debt this year, it said.  The rand’s strength against the dollar is helping to
contain oil import costs, alleviating inflation pressures that
would otherwise necessitate higher interest rates, Reuters
reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
