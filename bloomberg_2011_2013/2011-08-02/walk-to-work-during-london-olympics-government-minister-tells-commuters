U.K. Transport Minister Norman Baker
said  London  commuters should consider walking to work or using
video conferencing for meetings during the 2012  Olympic Games  to
relieve strain on the transport system.  “The games will be a once-in-a-generation test for both
our transport system and our adaptability,” Baker told business
leaders in London, according to remarks released by his office
today. “As we edge ever closer to the Olympics, hand-in-hand
with new investment must go new solutions.”  The government is expecting an extra 3 million trips a day
on the London transport network during the Olympics, piling
pressure on a system that already deals with 12 million journeys
every day. Baker said companies should encourage workers to
consider walking or cycling, particularly for those who live
near their workplaces.  Those workers who live farther away should consider
travelling during off-peak periods, staggering journeys or
working from home, Baker said.  To contact the editors responsible for this story:
