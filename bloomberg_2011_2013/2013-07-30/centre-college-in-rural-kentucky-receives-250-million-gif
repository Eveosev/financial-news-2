Centre College, a liberal arts
school in rural  Kentucky , received a $250 million donation, one
of the biggest in the history of U.S. higher education, to fund
science and economics scholarships.  The gift of stock in Universal Computer Systems Holding
Inc. comes from the A. Eugene Brockman Charitable Trust,
according to a  statement  from the college in Danville, Kentucky.  Centre, which hosted the 2012 vice-presidential debate, had
1,137 students last year and was ranked 52nd among liberal arts
colleges by U.S. News & World Report. The gift is the largest
outright donation to a U.S. liberal arts college, according to
the school. It is also among the largest gifts to any
institution of higher education, surpassed this year only by a
$350 million pledge by  Michael Bloomberg  to  Johns Hopkins
University .  “The Trust firmly believes that the Brockman Scholars
Program will become a model for other programs, further
demonstrating Centre’s leadership position among American
liberal arts colleges,” Evatt Tamine, trustee of the Brockman
Trust, said in the statement.  The gift will fund 40 scholarships annually, beginning in
2014, up to a total of 160. The scholars will be chosen on the
basis of academic merit, not need, and will receive free
tuition, room and board as well as funding to support summer
research or internships.  Auto Software  Universal Computer Systems is a closely held company that
owns  Reynolds & Reynolds Co. , a Kettering, Ohio-based supplier
of software to auto dealers. Reynolds’s chairman is Robert Brockman, the son of A. Eugene Brockman, and a former Centre
student from 1959 to 1961, said Richard Trollinger, Centre’s
vice president for college relations.  The gift, which will more than double Centre’s $230 million
endowment, was made as part of a larger restructuring and
recapitalization of Universal Computer, Trollinger said. The
college will own a minority stake in the company, he said.  Centre was founded in 1819. Its former students include
 John Breckinridge , U.S. vice president from 1857 to 1861, and
Adlai Stevenson, vice president from 1893 to 1897 and
grandfather of the 1952 and 1956 presidential candidate.  Bloomberg is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg
LP, the parent of  Bloomberg News .  To contact the reporter on this story:
