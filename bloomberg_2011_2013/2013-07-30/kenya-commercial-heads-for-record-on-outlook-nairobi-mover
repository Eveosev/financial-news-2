Kenya  Commercial Bank Ltd., the
country’s biggest lender by market value and assets, headed for
a record high after an increase in first-half profit by its main
competitor buoyed investors’ outlook for earnings.  The stock rose 1.8 percent to 43.50 shillings by 1:20 p.m.
in Nairobi, the highest on a closing basis since May 1997 when
Bloomberg began compiling the data. About 940,000 shares traded,
or 43 percent of the three-month daily average.  Equity Bank Ltd., Kenya’s largest lender by customers and
second-biggest by market value, said yesterday first-half profit
jumped to 6.3 billion shillings from 5.4 billion shillings a
year earlier on increased earnings from loans. The shares gained
as much as 1.5 percent before trading unchanged today.  “Usually the performance of KCB and Equity is similar and
some investors have begun taking position,” Moses Waireri, head
of research at Nairobi-based Sterling Capital Ltd., said by
phone. “We expect the performance to be similar or better than
the 17 percent profit growth reported by Equity yesterday.”  KCB, as the lender is known, said in May net income in the
three months through March rose to 3.03 billion shillings ($35
million) from 2.43 billion shillings a year earlier. Net
interest income, the money banks earn from interest charges,
increased 5.7 percent to 7.37 billion shillings during the
period. The company will announce first-half earnings in August.  Last month, the bank was rated buy in new coverage by
Nairobi-based Genghis Capital Ltd., with a price estimate of
44.68 shillings. KCB’s stock has surged 46 percent this year,
compared with a gain of 30 percent for the FTSE NSE Kenya 25
Share Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
