Sugar dropped from a four-week high
as dry weather in  Brazil , the world’s largest grower, eased
concern that earlier rain delays would limit the harvest.
Cotton, cocoa and orange juice rose, while coffee fell.  Brazil’s cane-growing regions will be mostly dry in the
next two weeks, allowing fieldwork and harvesting to advance,
Marcio Custodio, forecast director at Sao Paulo-based Somar
Meteorologia, said yesterday in an e-mail. Sugar output in the
Center-South region may reach 32 million metric tons, Archer
Consulting said. That compares with 34.1 million estimated by
Unica, a Sao Paolo-based industry group.  “Weather in Brazil for the next fortnight is forecast to
be good,” Nick Penney, a senior trader at Sucden Finacial Ltd.
in  London , wrote in a report today. “Although time has been
lost to rain, it is not inconceivable that millers can catch up
later in the year, as happened last season.”  Raw sugar for October delivery slipped 0.1 percent to 16.91
cents a pound at 10:52 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York ,
after rising to 16.98 cents, the highest for a most-active
contract since July 1. Prices through yesterday were down 26
percent in the past 12 months on signs that global output would
exceed demand.  Cotton futures for December delivery increased 0.4 percent
to 85.08 cents a pound on ICE, after dropping 1.5 percent in the
previous two sessions.  Cocoa futures for September delivery gained 0.2 percent to
$2,284 a ton on ICE, heading for the first advance since July
24.  Orange-juice futures for September delivery rose 0.4
percent to $1.465 a pound.  Arabica-coffee futures for delivery in September fell 0.1
percent to $1.2105 a pound on ICE, heading for a third straight
decline and the longest slump since May 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
