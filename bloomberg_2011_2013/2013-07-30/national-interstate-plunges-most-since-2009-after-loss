National Interstate Corp. (NATL) , the
insurer majority owned by American Financial Group Inc., plunged
the most since 2008 after reserves for claims in prior periods
proved inadequate, fueling a surprise quarterly loss.  National Interstate, which insures transportation
providers, fell 18 percent to $26.70 at 4:30 p.m. in New York,
the worst performer in the 495-company Russell 2000 Financial
Services Index.  The second-quarter net loss of $6.28 million, or 32 cents a
share, compares with profit of $7.27 million, or 37 cents, a
year earlier, the Richfield, Ohio-based insurer said in a
statement late yesterday. The average estimate was for a profit
of 41 cents, according to a Bloomberg survey of five analysts.  “We are obviously disappointed with our underwriting
results,” National Interstate Chief Executive Officer Dave Michelson said in the statement. “We experienced an unusual
number and magnitude of large claims. We also addressed emerging
deficiencies in a portion of our claims reserves.”  Costs tied to prior-year incidents were $8.4 million. The
insurer spent $1.14 on claims and expenses for every premium
dollar, compared with an underwriting profit a year earlier.
Higher costs were fueled by three claims, two tied to passenger
transportation and one in moving and storage, the company said.  “We are concerned and disappointed with the adverse
reserve development,” Robert Paun, an analyst at Sidoti & Co.,
said in a research note. While he said the costs were
uncharacteristic of the company, Paun cited “several years of
weak pricing and unfavorable market conditions in the
commercial-auto and transportation segments that could result in
future adverse adjustments.”  Paun, who has a neutral rating on the insurer, cut his
full-year earnings-per-share estimate to 58 cents from $1.67.
National Interstate has declined about 7.4 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
