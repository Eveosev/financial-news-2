Beijing Enterprises Holdings Ltd. (392) 
said it will pay HK$8.22 billion ($1.1 billion) to its state-owned parent for a stake in  China Gas Holdings Ltd. (384) , a supplier
of natural gas to 184 Chinese cities.  The company will pay HK$7.80 a share to Beijing Enterprises
Group for 22.01 percent of China Gas, Hong Kong-based Beijing
Enterprises Holdings said today in a statement. That’s 12
percent less than yesterday’s closing price of China Gas.  Following the transaction Beijing Enterprises Holdings will
be the biggest shareholder in China Gas, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The parent increased its stake in China
Gas last year after  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (386)  and  ENN
Energy Holdings Ltd. (2688)  made a takeover offer for China Gas.  “With this investment in China Gas, the company expects to
strengthen its market position in the China natural gas
industry,” Beijing Enterprises Holdings said in the statement.
“The company and China Gas can mutually benefit from the
synergies created by their collaboration.”  Beijing Enterprises Holdings dropped 4 percent to HK$53.10
as of 2:08 p.m. in  Hong Kong  trading, while the benchmark Hang
Seng Index gained 0.3 percent. China Gas rose 0.2 percent to
HK$8.85.  Beijing Enterprises Holdings will pay its parent HK$2
billion in cash and issue 113 million new shares at HK$55 a
piece, it said. Morgan Stanley is advising Beijing Enterprises
Holdings.  The purchase needs approval from the company’s independent
shareholders, Beijing Enterprises Holdings said. The parent,
which holds about 58 percent, will abstain from voting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
