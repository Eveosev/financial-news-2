K+S AG (SDF)  fell the most in 15 years in
Frankfurt trading after the world’s largest potash producer OAO
Uralkali predicted prices for the crop nutrient will fall about
25 percent as it opts to sell volume independently from a
trading group.  K+S plunged as much as 19 percent, the biggest decline
since September 1998, to 21.45 euros and was trading down 16
percent at 22.47 euros as of 9:55 a.m. local time.  Prices of potash may fall below $300 a ton after the change
in Uralkali’s trading policy, the company’s Chief Executive
Officer Vladislav Baumgertner told reporters today by phone. The
Russian company is quiting a potash trading venture with a
Belarusian potash producer, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
