Mexico ’s yen bonds surged after the
government sold debt in the Japanese currency for a second year
in a row, tapping into demand for the Latin American country’s
assets from investors in the world’s third-biggest economy.  Yields on Mexican government yen debt maturing in 2015 fell
nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 0.99 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was the biggest one-day drop since the securities were issued in 2012. Mexico’s peso
depreciated 0.1 percent to 12.7662 per dollar.  The bonds rallied after Mexico sold yesterday 80.6 billion
yen ($822 million) of so-called Samurai debt maturing in 2016,
2018 and 2019. The bonds were priced to yield 1.16 percent, 1.39
percent and 1.54 percent, the lowest ever for any  government
bonds  with similar maturities, the  Finance Ministry  said in a
statement. More than 60 Japanese investors participated in the
sale, according to the ministry.  Mexico issued the notes “at relatively attractive
levels,” Vivienne Taberer, a  money manager  who helps oversee
about $14.5 billion in emerging-market assets at Investec Asset
Management, said by phone from  Cape Town . Shorter-term yen debt
is rallying today after the sale was “probably quite well
subscribed.”  Mexico’s central bank said today that international
reserves rose by $1.25 billion in the week ended July 26 to
$168.2 billion.  The central bank also said that the Finance Ministry sold
today a total of 24 billion pesos ($1.9 billion) in bills
maturing in one, three and six months that it offered at
auction. The government also sold 9 billion pesos in fixed-rate
peso debt maturing in December 2016 today, according to the
central bank.  The yield on Mexican government peso bonds maturing in 2024
fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.01 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
