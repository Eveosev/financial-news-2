China  is studying a plan to reduce
overcapacity in steel, cement, aluminum and other industries
after production increased without effective supervision, the
official newspaper of the Communist Party  reported  today.  Some local governments offered low-price land,  tax
deductions , subsidies and credit support to attract investment,
leading to “disorderly expansion,” the People’s Daily
reported, citing Ministry of Industry and Information Technology
spokesman Zhu Hongren.  Of the 18 million metric tons of aluminum capacity added in
the “past few years,” only 800,000 tons were approved by the
central government, the People’s Daily reported. China also has
800 million tons of unapproved cement capacity, it said. The
utilization ratio for steel plants has fallen to 72 percent,
71.9 percent for aluminum and 73.7 percent for cement, lower
than the normal rates worldwide, the report said.  Premier  Li Keqiang  has pledged to curb overcapacity, which
Chinese authorities have cited for driving down the prices of
industrial goods, eroding company profits and generating
pollution. China last week ordered more than 1,400 companies in
19 industries to cut excess production capacity this year.  The newspaper reiterated a May 10 notice by the MIIT and
National Development and Reform Commission to “strictly
forbid” the building of new plants in industries with
overcapacity and to stop ongoing projects.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
