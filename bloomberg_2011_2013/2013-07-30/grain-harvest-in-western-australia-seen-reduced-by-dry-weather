Grain output in Western Australia,
poised to be the country’s biggest wheat producer, may be curbed
for a second year by dry weather, according to  marketer  Plum
Grove Pty Ltd.  “Average, in total, is 10.3 million tons,” Andrew Young,
managing director at the Fremantle-based company, said in an
interview in  Melbourne  today, referring to the usual annual
production for all grains. “We would probably be somewhere
around 8.5 million at best.”  The state wheat crop tumbled 38 percent to 6.9 million tons
last year after dry weather curbed yields. Output may rebound to
8.8 million tons this year on increased area, the Australian
Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences
forecast in June. The state’s south had an extraordinarily dry
June and southwest regions had near-average rainfall in May,
according to the Bureau of Meteorology.  “Unless we get a massive amount of spring rain, we’re at
best average to just below average,” said Young. “Parts of the
eastern Wheatbelt, around Merredin and north of Merredin, some
areas are a write-off.”  Grain regions in the state have a roughly equal  chance  of a
wetter- or drier-than-normal period from August to October, the
weather bureau said July 24. Mitsui & Co. has a 25 percent stake
in Plum Grove.  To contact the reporter on this story:
