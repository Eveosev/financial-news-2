Palm oil  traded near the lowest
level in almost four years on forecasts for record global
supplies of cooking oils.  The contract for delivery in October dropped as much as 1.4
percent to 2,137 ringgit ($661) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives, matching the intraday low on July 26, the
cheapest price since October 2009. Futures ended the morning
session little changed at 2,170 ringgit, set for a 7.4 percent
loss this month, the most since September.  Palm production, accounting for 35 percent of cooking oil
supply, will expand 5 percent to 58.1 million tons, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show. Soybean oil, a competing
product, slumped yesterday to the lowest since 2010 as supplies
of the second most-consumed edible variety will rise to a  record 
for a fifth year and reach 44.6 million tons, the USDA predicts.  “The decline in  soybean oil  prices is quite steep because
of the bumper harvest,” said Benny Lee, a market strategist at
Jupiter Securities Sdn. in Kuala Lumpur. “The weaker ringgit
should make palm oil a bit more attractive against soybean oil
prices, but because demand is actually lower than expected, I
don’t think it will actually help lift palm oil prices a lot.”  Prices may drop to as low as 1,900 ringgit this quarter
before rebounding by the end of the year, said Lee. The ringgit
fell to a three-year low on concern investors will repatriate
funds after $2.9 billion of sovereign debt matures tomorrow.  Soybean oil for delivery in December was little changed at
42.84 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade after
declining to the lowest level since September 2010 yesterday.
Soybeans for delivery in November declined 0.4 percent to
$12.155 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for January delivery dropped as much as
0.9 percent to 5,306  yuan  ($865) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange , the lowest level for the most-active contract since
March 2009. Soybean oil fell as much as 1.3 percent to 6,902
yuan, the lowest level since October 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
