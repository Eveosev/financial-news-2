The Swiss central bank said  UBS AG (UBSN) ,
the country’s biggest bank, plans to buy back the fund set up in
2008 to help the company get rid of toxic assets.  “Based on the current trend, the outstanding loan will be
repaid shortly, and the SNB therefore expects UBS to exercise
its purchase option to take over the stabilization fund in
2013,” the Zurich-based Swiss National Bank said in a statement
today.  The central bank’s fund was part of the bailout of UBS at
the height of the financial crisis. UBS spun off $38.7 billion
in risky assets into the fund, while the government provided 6
billion francs of equity and the SNB made a loan to support the
assets while they were being run down.  As part of the agreement, UBS was granted an option to buy
back the equity of the fund once the SNB’s loan was fully
repaid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
