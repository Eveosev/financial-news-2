China Life Insurance Co., the
nation’s largest insurer, estimated its first-half profit may
rise by more than 50 percent from a year earlier.  The surge is attributed to an increase in investment income
combined with a decline in impairment losses, the Beijing-based
insurer said in a  statement  to Hong Kong’s stock exchange
without further elaboration.  The preliminary estimate is based on unaudited numbers.  China Life booked profit of 9.6 billion  yuan  ($1.6
billion), or 0.34 yuan per share, in the first half last year.  The Hong Kong-traded shares closed unchanged at HK$18.44
today. They have declined 27 percent this year compared with a
1.1 percent drop in the Hang Seng Finance Index, which
tracks 12 banks, insurers and the city’s exchange operator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
