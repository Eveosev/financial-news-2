Morgan Stanley (MS)  agreed to pay
$100,000 to the  New Jersey  Bureau of Securities for violating
state laws by selling non-traditional exchange-traded funds to
investors.  The amount includes $65,000 in civil penalties, $25,000 to
reimburse the bureau’s investigative costs and $10,000 for the
bureau to use for investor education, according to a statement
from the New Jersey Office of the Attorney General. The firm
previously paid $96,940.34 to reimburse New Jersey investors,
according to the statement.  The bureau’s investigation found that Morgan Stanley
advisers recommended non-traditional ETFs to elderly investors
who were looking for assets that offered income, according to
the statement. The investors lost money on the “unsuitable”
offerings. Morgan Stanley didn’t admit or deny the bureau’s
findings.  “Morgan Stanley is pleased to reach this resolution with
the state of New Jersey,” Christine Jockle, a spokeswoman for
the New York-based firm, said in an e-mailed statement. “The
settlement covers the period of January 2007 to June 2009, and
Morgan Stanley revamped its processes regarding these products
over four years ago.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
