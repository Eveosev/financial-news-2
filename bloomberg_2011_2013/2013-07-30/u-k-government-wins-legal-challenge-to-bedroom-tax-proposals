U.K. government curbs on housing
benefits for those in rented property with unused bedrooms
doesn’t illegally discriminate against vulnerable people in
social housing,  London  judges ruled.  The two-judge panel dismissed a challenge from 10 people,
ruling that changes to benefits rules are justified and lawful
even though they are discriminatory. The claimants were today
refused permission to appeal at London’s High Court.  The benefits overhaul, which started on April 1, is part
of the government’s efforts to cap benefit increases at 1
percent a year over the next three years, below the projected
inflation rate. The housing-benefit curbs, known as the bedroom
tax, will save an estimated 500 million pounds-a-year, according
to the Department for Work and Pensions, or DWP. Church leaders
have described the plans as “unjust.”  “Many people with disabilities including our clients may
lose their homes unless the law is changed,” Richard Stein, a
lawyer representing some of the claimants, said in an e-mailed
statement. “We will be seeking an urgent appeal.”  Overhauling housing benefits is “essential, so the
taxpayer does not pay for people’s extra bedrooms,” the DWP
said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
