Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. ,
 Canada ’s largest maker of the fertilizer, fell the most in four
years after OAO Uralkali, the world’s largest producer, broke up
a cartel that controlled 43 percent of world exports, driving
down prices.  Potash Corp. plunged 17 percent to $31.63 in New York, the
biggest decline since October 2008. Competing Canadian potash
producer  Agrium Inc. (AGU)  fell 5.4 percent and Mosaic Co. of the U.S.
tumbled 17 percent.  Uralkali pulled out of a joint venture with Belarus, the
Berezniki, Russia-based company said in statements. The move may
push prices for the soil nutrient used in fertilizer to less
than $300 a ton, Uralkali Chief Executive Officer Vladislav Baumgertner told reporters today.  “Uralkali’s announcement completely turns the global
market upside down,” Elena Sakhnova, a VTB Capital analyst in
Moscow, told Bloomberg by phone. “Now the market will be fully
competitive.”  Potash prices have already slumped this year because of
stockpiles in  China , which imports a fifth of global supplies,
and low import volumes in  India . Potash Corp. had already cut
its 2013 earnings forecast by as much as 20 percent.  The company said last week it sold potash for an average
price of $356 a metric ton in the second quarter, compared with
$433 a ton a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
