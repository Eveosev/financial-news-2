Treasuries are poised to fall this
month, marking their first July loss in eight years, on
speculation the world’s biggest economy will avoid a mid-year
lull and the  Federal Reserve  will curb bond purchases.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows U.S. government securities with
maturities of more than one year have lost 0.3 percent since
June 30 after rising in July every year since 2006. The only
month with a longer stretch of gains this century is August,
when Treasuries rallied from 2000 through 2011, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Green blocks on the chart indicate when prices
rose and red squares when they fell.  Economists are forecasting employment growth is fast enough
now for the Fed to scale back the $85 billion a month bond-buying program it uses to support the economy. Summer slowdowns
brought jobs gains last year down to 87,000 in June from 311,000
in January. In 2011, the figure slid to 78,000 in July from
304,000 in April.  “This year is different from earlier years,” said Bin Gao, an interest-rate strategist in  Hong Kong  at Bank of America
Corp., one of the 21 primary dealers that trade directly with
the Fed. “This is the first year when we have the threat of Fed
tapering. In the earlier years, the risk was of more Fed buying.
There’s a big distinction between these two eras.”  A Labor Department report Aug. 2 will probably show the
U.S. added 185,000 jobs in July, according to a survey of
economists by  Bloomberg News . Employment growth has averaged
201,000 in 2013, versus 179,000 across the prior two years.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and his fellow policy makers
meet today and tomorrow to discuss their program of bond buying.
They will start trimming purchases in September, according to
half of the economists surveyed by Bloomberg News July 18 to
July 22.  To contact the reporters on this story:
