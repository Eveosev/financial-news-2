Prices paid to Canadian
manufacturers rose for the first time in four months in June, as
a weakening currency boosted prices for motor vehicles. Raw
material costs rose for a second month.  The  industrial product price index  increased 0.3 percent,
 Statistics Canada  said today from Ottawa. Economists predicted a
0.2 percent gain, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey with 9 responses. Motor vehicle prices rose 1
percent during the month, due in part to a 1.1 percent decline
in the value of the Canadian dollar, the statistics agency said.  The  raw-materials price  index rose 0.3 percent. The index
was forecast to rise 0.5 percent according to the median
estimate in a separate survey that had seven responses.  For the 12 months ending in June, industrial prices were up
0.6 percent while raw-materials costs gained 4 percent,
suggesting factory profit margins have shrunk in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
