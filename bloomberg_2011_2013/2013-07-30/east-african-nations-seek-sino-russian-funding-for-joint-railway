Kenya , Uganda and Rwanda will seek
funding from Russia and China for a planned $13 billion
standard-gauge railway linking their capitals to boost trade.  The three countries will jointly mobilize the funds,
although each nation will shoulder costs of its portion of the
line, whose construction will cost $5 million per kilometer,
John Byabagambi, Uganda’s minister of state for works, told
reporters today in the capital, Kampala.  The initial phase, starting from Kenya’s coastal city of
Mombasa linking to the capital, Nairobi, will start in November,
he said. The entire project from Mombasa to the Rwandan capital,
Kigali, through Kampala, will be concluded in March 2018, he
said.  The project was agreed by Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta,
Ugandan President  Yoweri Museveni  and Paul Kagame, the Rwandan
leader, at a meeting in Kampala last month.  “The three countries are going to source funding
together,” Byabagambi said. “We are looking at eastern
countries and it is Russia and China which have excess funds.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
