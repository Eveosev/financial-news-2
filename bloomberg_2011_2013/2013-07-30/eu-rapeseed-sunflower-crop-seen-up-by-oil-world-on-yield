European Union rapeseed and
sunflower seed harvests are forecast to climb on increased
planting and higher yields, Oil World said.  Rapeseed production in the EU excluding  Croatia  is
predicted to rise to 20.5 million metric tons from 19.4 million
tons in 2012, the biggest crop in three years, while the
sunflower crop may climb to 8.25 million tons from 6.92 million
tons, the Hamburg, Germany-based researcher wrote.  Rapeseed for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris, the European benchmark, has slumped 15 percent this year
on an outlook for bigger crops in Europe as well as rising
soybean production in the U.S.  “Prospective larger-than-expected new-crop supplies of
rapeseed and sunseed in the EU are keeping soft-seed prices
under considerable pressure both on the domestic market and
worldwide,” Oil World wrote.  The harvested rapeseed area is estimated at 6.47 million
hectares (16 million acres) from 6.22 million hectares in 2012,
with yields rising to an estimated 3.17 tons per hectare from
3.12 tons in 2012.  Germany  is predicted to overtake  France  as the bloc’s
largest grower of rapeseed, lifting output to 5.75 million tons
from 4.82 million tons, while French production is seen sliding
to 5 million tons from 5.48 million tons.  The EU’s sunflower area is seen at 4.44 million hectares
from 4.24 million hectares last year, with yields advancing to
1.88 tons per hectare from 1.63 tons, Oil World wrote.  “Warm temperatures and largely sufficient moisture
supplies have supported the development of sunflower crops in
the major growing regions of late, suggesting very promising
yields,” Oil World said.  Sunflower seed production in France, the EU’s biggest
grower, is forecast to rise to 1.77 million tons from 1.58
million tons, the report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
