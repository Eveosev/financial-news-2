Canadian  stocks  fell, poised for the
biggest drop in a month, after OAO Uralkali, the world’s largest
potash producer, predicted prices for the crop nutrient will
fall about 25 percent after it exits an export cartel.  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. fell 21 percent, the most
in almost five years, as Uralkali predicted potash prices may
fall below $300 a ton after a change in the company’s trading
policy. Progressive Waste Solutions Ltd. rose 5 percent after
raising its profit forecast.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 91.23
points, or 0.7 percent, to 12,577.81 at 10:35 a.m. in Toronto.
The gauge has gained 1.2 percent this year. Trading volume was
11 percent higher than the 30 day average at this time of day.  Prices paid to Canadian manufacturers rose for the first
time in four months in June, as a weakening currency boosted
prices for motor vehicles. Raw material costs rose for a second
month.  The industrial product price index increased 0.3 percent,
 Statistics Canada  said today from Ottawa. Economists predicted a
0.2 percent gain, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey with 9 responses. Motor vehicle prices rose 1
percent during the month, due in part to a 1.1 percent decline
in the value of the Canadian dollar, the statistics agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
