Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid 
said the U.S. Senate won’t vote on the nomination of
Representative Mel Watt to oversee mortgage giants  Fannie Mae (FNMA) 
and Freddie Mac before Congress adjourns this week for its
summer break.  Watt, a North Carolina Democrat, was selected by President
Barack Obama to head the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the
regulator for the U.S-owned mortgage financiers. Republicans
have argued that as a lawmaker, Watt isn’t qualified for the
job.  Reid had previously said he would try to bring Watt’s
nomination to the Senate floor before the congressional recess
that begins Aug. 3.  Watt needs support from at least six Republicans to gain
the 60 votes needed for the Senate to take up his confirmation.
Senator  Richard Burr  of North Carolina is the only Republican
who has endorsed him so far.  To contact the reporters on this story:
