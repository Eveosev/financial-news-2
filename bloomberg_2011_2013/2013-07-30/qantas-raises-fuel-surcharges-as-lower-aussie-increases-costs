Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN) ,  Australia ’s
largest carrier, will increase fuel surcharges by as much as
A$75 ($68) per leg on international flights as the decline in
the Australian dollar lifts the cost of jet fuel.  Domestic fares will rise by between 2 percent and 3 percent
in lieu of a surcharge increase, while the surcharges on
international routes will vary according to cabin class and
destination, according to a statement on the Sydney-based
company’s  website . The charges will apply for tickets issued
after Aug. 14 and are the first such increases since April 2012,
it said.  Qantas pays U.S. dollars for a fuel bill that ran to A$4.33
billion during 2012, exposing it to higher costs as the Aussie’s
13 percent fall against the greenback since April raises the
price of U.S.-dollar denominated products. As the U.S. economy
recovers and  China  slows, a traditional correlation between fuel
prices and the Aussie has frayed, with Singapore jet fuel prices
rising 5.7 percent over the same period, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Fuel prices  are a natural hedge against the Australian
dollar and fall in tandem with the commodity-linked local
currency, Chief Executive Officer Alan Joyce said in a May 21
interview.  Qantas’s “ideal spot” is an exchange rate of between 80
U.S. cents and 90 U.S. cents to the Australian dollar, Joyce
said, “as long as our price maintains that correlation”
between oil and the currency.  The local currency traded at 90.66 U.S. cents as of 9:13
a.m. in Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
