Louis Oosthuizen will miss next
month’s  PGA Championship  to recover from injuries that forced
his withdrawal from the British Open.  Oosthuizen pulled out of the season’s third golf major 12
days ago at Muirfield in Scotland because of long-standing
injuries to his neck, back and hip. He’ll be out two months for
a period of rest, rehabilitation and strengthening.  “It is obviously very disappointing to miss out on playing
in such prestigious tournaments,” the South African, who’ll
also sit out this week’s World Golf Championships Bridgestone
Invitational in  Ohio , said in a statement. “But these are
injuries that I have been managing for most of the season. It is
important that I now give myself the proper time to recover.”  The PGA Championship will be played Aug. 8-11 at Oak Hill
Country Club in Rochester, New York. Oosthuizen, the 2010
British Open winner, is expected to return at the Alfred Dunhill
Links Championship in Scotland in late September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
