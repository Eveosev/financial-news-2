TransAlta Corp. (TA) ,  Canada ’s largest
publicly traded power generator, reported second-quarter profit
that missed analysts’ estimates as a force majeure at a plant
reduced its generating capacity.  Excluding one-time items, the company earned 3 cents a
share, less than the 18-cent average of eight  analysts’
estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Net income was C$15 million
($15 million), or 6 cents a share, compared with a loss of C$798
million, or C$3.52, a year earlier, the Calgary-based company
said in a statement today.  The company’s generating availability in the second quarter
fell to 82 percent from 87 percent a year earlier after a
winding failure was discovered at its Keephills Unit 1 coal
power plant. TransAlta claimed force majeure relief, which
allows it to suspend contractual obligations in the event of
extraordinary circumstances without paying penalties.  The company now expects full-year adjusted availability to
be 87 to 89 percent instead of its intial target range of 89 to
90 percent, TransAlta said in the statement.  The shares fell 3.9 percent to C$14.30 at 11:38 a.m. in
Toronto, the biggest intraday decline since June 20. The stock
has one hold and six sell  recommendations  from analysts.  TransAlta on June 26 said it plans an initial public
offering of some renewable-energy assets. TransAlta Renewables
will have about 1,112 net megawatts of wind and hydropower
plants. The company, which will retain an 80 percent to 85
percent stake in the renewables unit, expects to raise C$200
million to C$250 million when the share sale closes in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
