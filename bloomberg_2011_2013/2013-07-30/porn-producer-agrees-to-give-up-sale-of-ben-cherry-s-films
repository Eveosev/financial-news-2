The seller of adult films with
titles and packages based on Ben & Jerry’s Homemade Inc. flavors
will comply with a court order to stop selling the movies, a
lawyer for the ice-cream maker said.  Rodax Distributors Inc., which does business as Caballero
Video, will stop selling its “Ben & Cherry’s” series of 10
DVDs with titles including “Peanut Butter D-Cups” and “Boston
Cream Thigh.” The court order, filed yesterday in New York
federal court, was the product of a settlement agreement, said
Gregory Gulia, a lawyer representing Ben & Jerry’s. Gulia
declined to disclose specific terms of the agreement.  In September, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan issued an
order requiring Caballero to recall the DVDs and to destroy all
products, labels and marketing materials that infringe on Ben &
Jerry’s trademarks as the case progressed.  Ben & Jerry’s, a unit of London-based  Unilever NV (UNA) , sued
Caballero last year, claiming the DVDs and packaging violated
its trademarks. The packaging featured images of naked men and
women against backgrounds that copy the design of Ben & Jerry’s
ice cream containers such as grazing cows and fluffy white
clouds, the company said in its complaint.  Tomer Yoffe, a spokesman for Caballero Video, couldn’t
immediately be reached by phone for comment on the settlement.  The case is Ben & Jerry’s Homemade Inc. v. Rodax
Distributors Inc., 12-cv-06734, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
