Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
widened on speculation a 15 percent drop in cash corn prices
this month will help companies boost output.  The spread, or the price difference, expanded 0.89 cent to
79.54 cents a gallon at 12:17 p.m.  New York  time as the price of
 cash corn  fell for a sixth day, extending the longest streak
since Feb. 15. Ethanol, which has dropped 9.5 percent this
month, is made mostly from corn in the U.S., with one bushel of
the grain yielding at least 2.75 gallons of the renewable fuel.  “That seems to be correlating to the plunge in cash
corn,” said  Chris Wilson , a broker at Atten Babler Risk
Management LLC in Galena,  Illinois .  Denatured ethanol for August delivery fell 0.5 cent to
$2.221 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have
climbed 1.4 percent this year.  Gasoline for August delivery increased 0.39 cent to $3.0164
a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The contract
covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol
before delivery to filling stations. Inventories of the motor
fuel probably dropped 1.5 million barrels last week, according
to a Bloomberg survey before an Energy Information
Administration report tomorrow.  Ethanol  production  climbed 11 percent to 853,000 barrels a
day in the week ended July 19 from a record low in January, data
from the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm, show.
Stockpiles of the fuel have jumped for three consecutive weeks,
the longest streak of gains since December.  Corn Prices  Corn for September delivery rose 1.25 cents to $4.905 a
bushel in  Chicago . The more-actively traded December contract
gained 0.75 cents to $4.74.  The corn crush spread, or the cost difference between a
gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, based on
September contracts, was 34 cents, unchanged from yesterday.  Tracking certificates called Renewable Identification
Numbers, or RINs, are used by the government and refiners to
maintain adherence to the energy law.  Corn-based-ethanol RINs were unchanged 97 cents, while
 advanced RINs , which cover Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol and
biodiesel, remained at $1, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Wilson also said ethanol prices may also be tempered by
expectations for higher imports.  Foreign purchases  of the biofuel have averaged 21,000
barrels a day so far this year, more than double the pace from a
year ago, EIA data show.  Anhydrous ethanol in  Sao Paulo  costs $2.18 a gallon in the
week ended July 19, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
