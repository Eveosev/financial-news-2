The  Pennsylvania  health department
sued a court clerk of a county near Philadelphia to stop him
from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.  Under Pennsylvania law, marriage is defined as a civil
contract between a man and a woman, the department said in a
complaint filed today in Commonwealth Court in Harrisburg.  D. Bruce Hanes , clerk of Orphans’ Court of Montgomery
County in Norristown, has been “acting in clear derogation of
the marriage law,” lawyers for the health department said in
the complaint. “Ours is a government of laws, not one of public
officials exercising their will as they believe the law should
be.”  The Health Department sued because it has jurisdiction to
review marriage licenses while compiling vital statistics,
according to the lawsuit.  A group of state residents sued Governor Thomas Corbett
earlier this month saying Pennsylvania’s ban on same-sex
marriage is unconstitutional and must be overturned.  Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane said she
wouldn’t defend a court challenge to the state’s same-sex
marriage ban, which she called “wholly unconstitutional.”  Hanes declined to comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,  Department of
Health , v. Hanes, 379-M.D.-2013, Commonwealth Court of
Pennsylvania (Harrisburg).  To contact the reporter on this story:
