London police expanded an
investigation into computer hacking and corporate spying to
include people and companies beyond the press.  Operation Tuleta, opened in the wake of two other probes
into reporting practices at  News Corp. (NWSA)  newspapers, is now
looking into “companies and individuals outside of the  media
industry ,” a Metropolitan Police spokeswoman said. She declined
to comment further on the details of the case.  Police opened the investigation in July 2011 following
probes into hacking of mobile-phone voicemails and allegations
of bribery at British newspapers. At least 20 people have been
arrested as part of the computer-hacking investigation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
