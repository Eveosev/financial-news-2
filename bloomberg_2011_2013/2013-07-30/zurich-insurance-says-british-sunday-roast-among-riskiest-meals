Britain’s traditional Sunday roast
is the riskiest meal to prepare, ahead of chicken tikka masala
and the full English breakfast,  Zurich Insurance Group (ZURN)  said.  Sunday roasts are the riskiest because of the variety of
ingredients cooking at the same time, “the number of knives
needed for peeling and chopping,” and the potential for pans to
boil over, the Zurich-based insurer said in an e-mailed
statement today, citing a survey of British meals. Fish and
chips and bangers and mash are also in the top five.  Analysts at the insurer’s U.K. unit ranked food favorites
as part of an audit of kitchen-related risks, where more than
half of accidental fires are started, according to British
statistics. Switzerland’s largest insurer has no data on how
many fires are caused by roast dinners or the size of their
insurance claims, said London-based spokeswoman Katy Hurren.  The least risky dish is beans on toast, according to the
survey. To calculate the risk of the cooking processes, the
company broke down each component of action required to prepare
and cook the dishes, estimating the consequence and frequencies
of events and plotting them against the consequence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
