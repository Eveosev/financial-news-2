A fund backed by the U.K.’s  Green
Investment Bank  channeled 20 million pounds ($30.6 million) into
an energy project in Northern Ireland that will turn wood into
electricity and heat.  The money from the U.K. Waste Resources & Energy Fund,
managed by Foresight Group LLP, will help finance an 81 million-pound facility in Lisahally that will produce enough electricity
for more than 25,000 homes a year, the GIB said today in an e-mailed statement. It expects the plant to start working in 2015.  “Not only will the project save the same amount of carbon
as taking around 77,000 cars off the road, it will also make use
of over 2 million tons of wood, a valuable energy resource that
would otherwise have gone to landfill,” said GIB Chief
Executive Officer Shaun Kingsbury. Every pound of GIB investment
brought in more than three pounds of private funding, he said.  The 15.8-megawatt power plant, to be built by Evermore
Renewable Energy, also received investment from GCP
Infrastructure Fund Ltd. and Burmeister & Wain Scandinavian
Contractor AS. The GIB expects it to be the largest clean-energy
project in Northern Ireland, according to the statement.  The U.K. Department of Energy and Climate Change estimates
bioenergy plants may meet 8 percent to 11 percent of the
nation’s primary energy demand by 2020. Bioenergy accounted for
the largest share of renewable-power output at the end of the
first quarter, reaching 34 percent, government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
