Electricite de France SA ,  Europe ’s
biggest power generator, increased its forecast for annual
profit growth after cold weather and higher hydroelectricity
output drove first-half results higher.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization will grow at least 3 percent, excluding results
from the Italian Edison unit, EDF said today in a statement. The
utility previously expected Ebitda to hold steady or rise no
more than 3 percent.  Profit by that measure rose 6.9 percent in the first half
to 9.7 billion euros ($12.9 billion), beating the 9.24 billion-euro median estimate of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Net
income advanced to 2.9 billion euros from 2.78 billion euros.  “The first half-year 2013 was marked by good operating
performance,” Chief Executive Officer  Henri Proglio  said in the
statement. Growth was driven by results in EDF’s home market as
the winter was colder than usual, driving up market prices,
while hydropower output expanded 25 percent. EDF also reported a
“favorable outcome” of arbitration on gas contracts in  Algeria 
between Edison and Sonatrach.  EDF rose as much as 4.9 percent to 21.215 euros in Paris
trading, and was at 21.195 euros as of 9:13 a.m. local time.  Tariff Revision  France ’s government has granted EDF tariff increases at
home, where it operates 58 nuclear reactors. Energy Minister
Philippe Martin authorized EDF to raise the regulated domestic
power rate by 5 percent on Aug. 1 and by a further 5 percent a
year later. While more than double last year’s 2 percent
increase, it’s less than the regulator’s recommendation of 6.8
percent to 9.6 percent this year to cover a shortfall in costs.  EDF today kept a target for French atomic output this year
of 410 terawatt-hours to 415 terawatt-hours after a 2012 decline
to 405 terawatt-hours. The utility is also in talks with the
U.K. about developing new atomic plants there and said it has
reached a deal to allow the sale of U.S. nuclear assets.  The Paris-based company has agreed with Chicago-based
 Exelon Corp. (EXC)  on an option to sell its 49.99 percent stake in
CENG, the operator of five nuclear plants in the U.S., from
January 2016 to June 2022, it said. EDF will also get an
exceptional dividend of $400 million from CENG.  The French utility reiterated a plan to save 1 billion
euros and said net investments will be 12 billion euros to 12.5
billion euros in 2013. Debt shrank to 33.7 billion euros at the
end of June from 39.2 billion euros in December, it said.  EDF faces billions of euros of costs to improve safety at
its French reactors after the authorities tightened rules
following the 2011 meltdown at  Japan ’s Fukushima plant. French
President  Francois Hollande  has vowed to lower dependence on
atomic energy and shut EDF’s oldest reactor in 2016. The
utility’s reactors supply three-quarters of France’s power
output, making it the world’s most nuclear-dependent country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
