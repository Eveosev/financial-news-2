A majority of U.K. businesses
support Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s plan to hold a referendum
on Britain’s membership of the European Union, the British
Chambers of Commerce said.  A survey of 3,906 companies showed 77 percent support a
referendum, with only 14 percent rejecting that view, the
London-based BCC said in an e-mailed statement today. Forty-three percent of businesses polled said the vote should only
take place after renegotiation of the U.K.’s position in the EU,
while 34 percent said it should happen sooner.  Cameron pledged in January to hold a referendum on whether
Britain should leave the EU or stay in, promising a popular vote
by the end of 2017 if re-elected in two years’ time and once he
has negotiated a return of some powers to the U.K.  “British businesses remain determined to see a
recalibrated relationship between the U.K. and the rest of the
EU, with more powers exercised from Westminster rather than
Brussels,” BCC Director General John Longworth said in the
statement. “There is impatience amongst a significant number of
companies for greater clarity on the U.K.’s position.”  Almost two-thirds of businesses favored the U.K. remaining
in the EU after specific powers had been transferred back to
Britain, the report showed.  The survey was carried out between May 20 and June 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
