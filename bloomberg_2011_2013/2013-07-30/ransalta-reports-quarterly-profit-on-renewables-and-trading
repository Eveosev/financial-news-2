TransAlta Corp. (TA) ,  Canada ’s largest
publicly traded power generator, reported a second-quarter
profit helped by results from its renewable-energy division and
improvements at its trading unit.  Net income was C$15 million ($15 million), or 6 cents a
share, compared with a loss of C$798 million, or C$3.52, a year
earlier, the Calgary-based company said in a statement on
Marketwired today. Excluding one-time items, the company earned
3 cents a share, less than the 18-cent average of eight
 analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  A trading loss in the second quarter of 2012 was
“abnormal,” Robert Kwan, a Vancouver-based analyst for RBC
Capital Markets, wrote in a July 22 note to clients.  TransAlta has gained since announcing on June 26 it plans
an initial public offering of some renewable-energy assets.
TransAlta Renewables will have about 1,112 net megawatts of wind
and hydropower plants. The company, which will retain an 80
percent to 85 percent stake in the renewables unit, expects to
raise C$200 million to C$250 million when the share sale closes
in August.  TransAlta rose 0.1 percent to C$14.88 yesterday in Toronto.
The stock has one hold and six sell  recommendations  from
analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
