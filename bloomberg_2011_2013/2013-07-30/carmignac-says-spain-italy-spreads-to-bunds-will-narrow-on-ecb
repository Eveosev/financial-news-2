Spain and Italy’s borrowing costs
will continue to converge with Germany’s as the  European Central
Bank  keeps interest rates low, according to Paris-based
Carmignac Gestion SA, which oversees $73 billion.  “The ECB has intervened to separate the situation in
Europe from that in the United States as Europe cannot afford
tighter financial conditions,” the  money manager  founded by
Edouard Carmignac said in a third-quarter strategy document
dated yesterday and received today. “It seems reasonable to
assume that yields in southern European countries will resume
their convergence.”  European government bonds including Spanish and Italian
securities make up 5.8 percent of the money manager’s Carmignac
Patrimoine fund, with the average maturity reduced to 4.3 years,
the firm said in the strategy document.  “We sold our long-term Treasuries, reinvesting the
proceeds in securities maturing in less than two years,”
Carmignac said. Treasuries make up 4.8 percent of the Patrimoine
fund, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
