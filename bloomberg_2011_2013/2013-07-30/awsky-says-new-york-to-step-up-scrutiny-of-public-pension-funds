New York  regulators are increasing
scrutiny of public pension funds, the head of the state’s
Department of Financial Services said.  “Taxpayers and retirees deserve strong strong oversight,”
Superintendent  Benjamin Lawsky  said today at an event sponsored
by Crain’s New York Business. “Shortly, you’re going to see
some of the audits that we’ve been conducting.”  Lawsky said he may propose new regulations on the funds to
increase transparency and accountability after the audits. DFS
oversees New York-based banks and insurers, as well as public
funds that pay benefits to retirees.  “I don’t want to jump the gun and tell you what our
findings are yet,” Lawsky said. “ Detroit  underscores why this
is important to do,” he said, adding that the probes weren’t
prompted by the Michigan city’s bankruptcy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
