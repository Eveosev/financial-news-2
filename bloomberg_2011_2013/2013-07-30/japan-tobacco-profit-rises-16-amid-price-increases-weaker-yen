Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914) ,  Asia ’s largest
listed tobacco maker, said first-quarter profit rose 16 percent
as price increases and the weaker yen boosted overseas profit.  Net income was 98.1 billion yen ($998 million) for the
three months ended June, an increase from 84.5 billion yen a
year earlier, the company said in a statement yesterday.  Japan Tobacco, seller of the Mevius brand, is benefiting as
a weaker yen boosts the value of  overseas revenue , which
accounted for about 48 percent of the company’s total in the
last fiscal year. The yen has fallen about 12 percent against
the dollar this year as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pushed for
monetary easing and economic stimulus measures called Abenomics.  Overseas tobacco business sales rose 16 percent to 271
billion yen in the first quarter, the company said yesterday. It
has increased prices in some markets including Russia and the
U.K.  The company faces a decline in demand in its home market
amid a shrinking population. The ratio of smokers in  Japan  fell
3.8 percentage points to 21.1 percent over the last three years,
according to company’s  website . Domestic tobacco sales fell 0.1
percent to 173 billion yen in the first quarter, according to
yesterday’s statement.  Japan Tobacco has changed the name of its best-selling Mild
Seven brand to Mevius amid tightening regulations worldwide.
Expressions such as ’mild’ are forbidden on packaging in the
areas of European Union, according to a company  website .  Japan Tobacco’s shares have gained 42 percent this year,
while the broader Topix index rose 34 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
