A ruling blocking New York’s ban on
large sodas was upheld by an appeals court, which said the
city’s Board of Health failed to act within the bounds of its
authority when it approved the plan.  A unanimous panel of the New York State Supreme Court’s
Appellate Division,  First Department , in  Manhattan  today upheld
Justice Milton Tingling’s March ruling striking down the city’s
plan to cap the size of sugary soft drinks sold in restaurants,
movie theaters, stadiums and arenas at 16 ounces a cup.  The city’s Board of Health in September approved Mayor
 Michael Bloomberg ’s plan. Groups representing beverage makers,
restaurants and theaters sued to block the plan a month later,
calling it “unprecedented interference” with consumer choice.  “The Board of Health overstepped the boundaries of its
lawfully delegated authority when it promulgated the portion cap
rule to curtail the consumption of soda drinks,” Justice Dianne T. Renwick wrote in the appeals court ruling. “It therefore
violated the state principle of separation of powers.”  The city disagrees with the panel’s reasoning and will
appeal to the state’s highest court in  Albany , corporation
counsel Michael Cardozo said in a statement.  The mayor is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg
LP, the parent company of  Bloomberg News .  The case is New York Statewide Coalition of Hispanic
Chambers of Commerce v. New York City Department of Health and
Mental Hygiene, 653584-2012, New York State Supreme Court, New
York County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
