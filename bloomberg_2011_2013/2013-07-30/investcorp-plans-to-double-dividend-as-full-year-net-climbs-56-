Investcorp Bank BSC, the Bahrain-based alternative investment firm managing $10.5 billion, plans
to double its dividend after full-year profit climbed 56 percent
amid a jump in fee income.  The board recommended paying $15 a share for the financial
year ending June 30, compared with $7.50 a year earlier, as well
as a 12 percent dividend on preference shares, the company said
today in a statement. Full-year profit advanced to $104.9
million from $67.4 million a year earlier as fees from managing
investment deals more than doubled to $193.4 million, it said.  The dividend “is not a one-off,” Chief Financial Officer
Rishi Kapoor told reporters today in Dubai. “We feel that we
are on a good trajectory to continue to certainly maintain that
higher level of dividend and potentially even grow it.”  Investcorp, which invests in private equity, funds of  hedge
funds  and real estate, paid clients and itself $2.1 billion last
year after asset sales. It completed eight new deals, such as
buying a controlling stake in oil and gas services provider
Hydrasun in a deal valued at as much as $300 million.  The company raised $1.5 billion for investments from
clients during the year, more than double that of the previous
year and the highest since the 2008 financial crisis, according
to the statement. That included $844 million of investments from
institutional investors in hedge funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
