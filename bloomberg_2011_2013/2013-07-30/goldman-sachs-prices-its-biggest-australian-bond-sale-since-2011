Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  raised
A$750 million ($680 million) in its biggest Australian bond sale
in more than two years.  The five-year debt transaction was priced to yield 170
basis points more than swaps, according to Goldman Sachs
spokeswoman Hayley Morris. The bank sold A$450 million of fixed-rate notes and A$300 million of floating-rate securities.  The Wall Street lender that generates most of its revenue
from trading last sold similar debt in November, when it priced
A$600 million of bonds with the same tenor at a 195 basis-point
spread, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It sold A$1.25 billion
of notes in May 2011.  Bank of America Corp. was the last U.S. bank to sell bonds
in  Australia , pricing A$850 million of 2018 notes on May 14,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Following record debt
sales in May, issuance in the South Pacific nation dropped to
the least since December 2011 last month as concern the Federal
Reserve will reduce stimulus roiled global markets.  The average spread for financial-company bonds in Australia
spiked to as high as 130 basis points more than swaps on July 2
before narrowing to 114 yesterday, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data show. While the premium is nearing its level before
Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke spoke about tapering at his June 19
news conference, issuance has remained muted.  Goldman Sachs holds the seventh-highest  credit rating  at
Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s. Bank of America
carries the same A- ranking as Goldman Sachs at S&P and is
graded two levels lower at Moody’s. The 5-1/4 year paper it sold
in May was priced at a spread of 190 basis points.  Today’s Goldman Sachs transaction was managed by the lender
itself, Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., National
Australia Bank Ltd. and Royal Bank of  Canada .  To contact the reporter on this story:
