Mozambique’s revenue from exporting
coal fell 7.4 percent in the second quarter as floods hampered
exports by Vale SA and Rio Tinto Group, according to the
nation’s central bank.  Revenue slid to $81.4 million from $87.9 million a year
earlier, central bank spokesman Waldemar de Sousa told
reporters. Earnings from power declined 23 percent to $55.5
million, while revenue from aluminum rose 4.8 percent to $306.3
million even as international price fell. Gas earnings climbed
24 percent to $62.4 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
