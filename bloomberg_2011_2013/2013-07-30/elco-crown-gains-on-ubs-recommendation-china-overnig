Chinese stocks traded in New York
rebounded from the biggest drop in two weeks after UBS AG
recommended buying  Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (MPEL)  shares and
 China  Life Insurance Co. forecast a first-half profit surge.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S. added 0.7 percent to 92.29 yesterday.
Melco, a casino operator in Macau, surged to a six-week high and
China Life, the nation’s biggest insurer, traded at the widest
 premium  over the Hong Kong stock in three months.  NQ Mobile Inc. (NQ) 
advanced to a record high, while  Shanda Games Ltd. (GAME)  tumbled for a
second day.  UBS raised its recommendation on Melco Crown from neutral,
according to a note yesterday. Wynn Resorts Ltd. said in a July
29 conference call that mass-market gaming revenue grew 22
percent this month. China’s ruling Politburo pledged to
stabilize growth after exports fell by the most since the global
financial crisis while manufacturing and investment cooled.  Estimates by Melco’s peers “have been largely positive on
Macau trends, especially when they look into July,” Brian McGill, a Philadelphia-based analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott
LLC, said by phone yesterday. “Macau is holding much better
than expected for now amid an economic slowdown in China.”  The iShares China Large-Cap  ETF (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., added 0.3 percent to $34.40.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed as investors
awaited results from the  Federal Reserve ’s policy meeting.  Manila Casino  Melco’s American depositary receipts gained 4 percent to
$24.79, the highest price since June 19. The ADRs, each
representing three underlying shares in the company, traded 4
percent  above  its stock in Hong Kong, the highest premium in
seven weeks.  UBS lifted Melco’s price target by 15 percent to $30,
adding that the company is its top pick among Macau casinos.
Melco joined Bell Corp. in the  Philippines  in building a casino
resort in Manila, which is expected to open in July 2014.  The company’s “Macau business is trading at a steep
discount to the sector average based on consensus estimated,
which is unwarranted,” Anthony Wong, a Hong Kong-based analyst
at UBS, wrote in the note. The Manila resort could be a
“differentiated and competitive product in the Philippines
gaming market.”  China Life’s ADRs soared 2.8 percent to $36.53 in  New York ,
rising the most in two weeks. The 2.4 percent  premium  in the
ADRs was the widest since April 25. Each ADR equals 25
underlying shares in the Beijing-based company.  Profit Surge  The insurer attributed its estimated first-half 50 percent
profit surge to an increase in investment income combined with a
decline in impairment losses. The company posted a profit of 9.6
billion  yuan  ($1.6 billion) in the first half of 2012, a 26
percent decline from the same period in 2011.  NQ Mobile, a Beijing-based mobile-security service
provider, surged 8.8 percent to $15.16, the highest price since
the company’s U.S. listing in May 2011. Is ADRs have gained for
13 consecutive days, the longest stretch of advances on record.  E-Commerce China Dangdang Inc. (DANG) , the nation’s biggest online
book retailer, jumped 6.5 percent to $9.51, the highest level
since April 2012. Its ADRs have surged 37 percent in July.  Shanda, a Shanghai-based online games company, sank 6.6
percent to a two-week low of $4.66. The drop followed a 20
percent plunge on July 29 after the company said it agreed to
buy two units of the parent company.  It’s unclear how this step will help Shanda build its
mobile-game platform as the company sought, 86Research Ltd. said
in a July 29 note.  Baidu Inc. (BIDU) , owner of China’s most popular web search
engine, climbed 1.8 percent to $131.69, the highest level in 11
months. The Beijing-based company sold $1 billion in five-year
notes yesterday at a yield of 1.9 percentage points over
similar-maturity  U.S. Treasuries  to help fund its $1.9 billion
acquisition of app store 91 Wireless, a deal announced July 15.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index in  Hong Kong  gained
0.3 percent to 9,669.61, rebounding from a one-week low, while
the  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  increased 0.7 percent to 1,990.06
in its first advance in five days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
