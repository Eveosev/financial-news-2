Olive oil prices have fallen more
than expected in recent weeks after consumers in Spain and  Italy 
“strongly” cut back on usage in response to tight supplies and
high prices, Oil World reported.  Shoppers in Spain, Italy and  Greece , the world’s biggest
olive-oil consuming countries, have switched to cheaper
vegetable oils as they face economic crisis, rising unemployment
and reduced disposable income, the Hamburg-based oilseed-industry researcher wrote in an e-mailed report.  Spanish olive oil prices are forecast to average about
$3,560 a metric ton in July, down from $3,706 in June and the
lowest level this year, Oil World wrote. The switch to cheaper
oils is “unprecedented” and contrasts with 2005-06, when
prices as high as $5,000 a ton resulted in “only a fractional”
drop of Spanish, Italian and Greek olive-oil consumption.  “This season has been different and domestic consumption
of sunflower oil, corn oil and palm oil has increased,” Oil
World wrote. “Because of the weak demand fundamentals, Spanish
prices of virgin olive oil are unlikely to reach or exceed
$4,000, which was originally expected to occur in the course of
this season.”  Olive oil consumption in the European Union is forecast to
slide by “an unprecedented” 270,000 tons, or 13 percent, to
1.74 million tons in the season through September 2013, Oil
World wrote.  Olive oil for September delivery has slumped 19 percent
this year to 2,240 euros ($2,970.69) a ton on the Mercado de
Futuros del Aceite de Oliva in Jaen, Spain, the lowest price for
that contract since August last year.  Demand Rationing  In addition to demand rationing, prices have been under
pressure due to larger exports from Tunisia, Morocco and  Turkey ,
according to the researcher. Prices are still about 17 percent
above the 10-year average price for July, Oil World said.  World production of pressed olive oil is forecast at 2.46
million tons, down from 3.44 million tons in 2011-12, according
to Oil World. Drought in Spain cut production to 614,000 tons
from 1.6 million tons, it said.  Olive oil production may climb to 3.3 million tons in
2013-14, led by a recovery in Spain, Oil World predicted.  “It is possible that olive oil prices will recover during
the remainder of the season, due to a supply squeeze before
relief from new crop harvesting occurs,” the researcher said.
“Small carry-over stocks will limit the recovery in world
supplies of olive oil next season.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
