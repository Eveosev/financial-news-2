Heavy Louisiana Sweetâ€™s premium to
West Texas Intermediate rose to the highest level since July 23
as the domestic benchmark crude oil traded about $1  lower 
against Brent.  HLS strengthened 70 cents to $6.10 a barrel above WTI in
Cushing at 12:18 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet oil increased 55 cents against
WTI to a premium of $6.40.  WTI lost ground to Brent today on concern that U.S.
economic growth has slowed. Gulf Coast oils strengthened this
week as the spread between overseas Brent and WTI diminished.  Poseidon gained 65 cents to an 80-cent premium to WTI.
 Thunder Horse  strengthened 60 cents to premium of $3.75 and
Southern Green Canyon rose 25 cents to 70 cents over WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
