Pitney Bowes Inc. (PBI) , a provider of
postal meters and other equipment, rose the most in six months
after agreeing to sell its management-services unit to  Apollo
Global Management LLC (APO)  for about $400 million in cash.  The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter,
the  Stamford , Connecticut-based company said today in a
statement.  The management-services division works with clients such as
McDonald’s Corp. and the state of Indiana to boost efficiency.
Selling the unit will let Pitney Bowes focus on mail products
and services and digital-commerce offerings, the company said.
It’s part of a series of strategic moves to realign the
business, according to Chief Financial Officer  Michael Monahan .  “We’re going to continue going through the portfolio as a
whole and make decisions as we see fit,” he said in an
interview today. “The value of the management-services business
could be best realized by being in a standalone space.”  Pitney Bowes shares rose 13 percent to $16.60 at the close
in New York, marking the biggest gain since Jan. 31. The stock
has climbed 56 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
