The pound weakened for a sixth day
against the euro amid bets the  Bank of England , which meets this
week, is more likely to say it favors additional stimulus than
either the  European Central Bank  or  Federal Reserve .  The U.K. currency fell the most in three weeks versus the
dollar before Britain’s policy makers release their quarterly
Inflation Report next week, which will include findings on
interest-rate guidance. The ECB and Fed also meet this week.
Sterling is headed for a fourth monthly loss versus the euro.
U.K. government bonds were little changed.  “We look for sterling to weaken going forward,” said
Michael Sneyd, a currency strategist at BNP Paribas SA in
 London . “The ECB’s activism is not to the same extent as the
Bank of  England  and forward guidance is going to differentiate
the Bank of England from the Federal Reserve.”  The pound fell 0.5 percent to 86.90 pence per euro as of
3:36 p.m. London time, set for its longest losing streak since
the period ended Jan. 14. Sterling has weakened 1.6 percent this
month. The U.K. currency dropped 0.6 percent to $1.5251, the
biggest decline since July 5.  BNP Paribas forecasts the pound will decline to 87.50 pence
per euro in the next two months, Sneyd said.  The nine-member Monetary Policy Committee led by Governor
 Mark Carney  will keep its bond-purchase program at 375 billion
pounds on Aug. 1, according to all except one of 42 economists
surveyed by  Bloomberg News . Officials will also hold the
benchmark interest rate at a record low of 0.5 percent, a
separate survey showed.  Forward Guidance  At the previous MPC meeting on July 3-4, Carney’s first,
officials signaled that they would keep  interest rates  at a
record low for longer than investors had been betting. The
analysis of providing forward guidance to be published in the
Inflation Report on Aug. 7 will include an assessment of
intermediate thresholds.  Sterling has weakened 1.2 percent in the past month,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that track
10 developed-nation currencies. The euro strengthened 0.5
percent and the dollar declined 1.5 percent.  The 10-year gilt yield fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 2.31 percent, having declined 13 basis
points this month. The 1.75 percent bond due September 2022 rose
0.04, or 40 pence per 1,000 pound face amount, to 95.40.  Gilts generated a loss of 2.8 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German
bunds fell 1.3 percent and U.S. Treasuries dropped 2.6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
