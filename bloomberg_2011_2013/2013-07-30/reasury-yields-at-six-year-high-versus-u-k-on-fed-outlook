Treasuries rose after  Australia ’s
central bank Governor Glenn Stevens said there’s room to lower
local  interest rates , triggering concern the health of the
global economy may fall short of expectations.  Benchmark U.S. 10-year  yields  fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 2.58 percent as of 1:44 p.m. in Tokyo,
Bloomberg Bond Trader data showed. The price of the 1.75 percent
note due in May 2023 rose 5/32, or $1.56 per $1,000 face amount,
to 92 26/32.  The  Reserve Bank  of Australia “is talking about the
possibility of cutting rates,” said Kim Youngsung, the
head of fixed income in Seoul at Samsung Asset Management Co.,
South Korea’s largest private bond investor with the equivalent
of $101.4 billion in assets. “After that, fixed income prices
went up. People are worried about a slow economic recovery.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
