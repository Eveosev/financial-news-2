Crude oil options volatility
increased as the underlying futures slumped to the lowest level
in almost four weeks before a government report that may show
U.S. economic growth is slowing.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options value, was 22.35 percent on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 4 p.m., up from 21.24 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for September delivery
slumped $1.47, or 1.4 percent, to $103.08 a barrel on the Nymex,
the lowest settlement since July 3.  Futures trimmed the biggest monthly advance since August
ahead of a report tomorrow that may show U.S. gross domestic
product expanded at a 1 percent annualized rate in the second
quarter, compared with 1.8 percent in the previous period,
according to a Bloomberg survey.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
September $95 puts, which gained 7 cents to 18 cents a barrel on
volume of 4,799 lots. September $105 calls were the second-most
active, with 3,281 contracts changing hands. They dropped 59
cents to $1.08 a barrel.  Calls, or bets that prices would rise, made up 55 percent
of electronic trading volume. In the prior session, bearish
bets, or puts, made up 59 percent of 68,975 contracts exchanged.  September $93 puts were the most active options yesterday
with 5,966 lots changing hands as they fell 3 cents to 6 cents a
barrel. September $95 puts slid 4 cents to 11 cents a barrel on
volume of 5,341 contracts.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 38,437
contracts. Next were December $90 puts with 37,814 and December
$70 puts with 35,000.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
