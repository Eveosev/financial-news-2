South African corn futures rose as
the rand weakened against the dollar, making imports of the
grain more expensive.  White corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, rose 2 percent to 2,353 rand ($239) a metric ton by
the midday close on the South African Futures Exchange. The
yellow variety for September delivery gained 1 percent to 2,138
rand a ton.  The rand depreciated for the third day as investors await
guidance from the U.S. Federal Reserve on monetary stimulus,
while bonds rose amid bets  South Africa ’s budget balance swung
to a surplus last month.  “This was due to the fact that the rand weakened against
the dollar today,” Benjamin Swanepoel, a trader for Trademar
Futures (Pty) Ltd., said by phone from Johannesburg.  South Africa is the continent’s biggest producer of corn.
The white grain is a staple food in the country, while the
yellow variety is mainly used as  animal feed .  Wheat for delivery in December gained 0.8 percent to 3,300
rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
