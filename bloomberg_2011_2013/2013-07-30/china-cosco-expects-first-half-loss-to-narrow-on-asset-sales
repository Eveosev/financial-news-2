China Cosco Holdings Co. (1919) , the
nation’s biggest shipping company, dropped the most in almost a
month in Hong Kong trading after saying it expects to post a
first-half loss.  The shares fell as much as 3.6 percent, heading for the
biggest drop since July 3. It traded 2.4 percent down at HK$3.27
as of 11:30 a.m. The city’s  Hang Seng Index  gained 0.2 percent.  The net loss in the six months to June will probably narrow
by as much as 85 percent from 4.87 billion  yuan  ($794 million) a
year earlier, helped by one-off gains from asset sales, the
company said in an exchange  filing  yesterday. China Cosco,
 unprofitable  in the past two years, faces slowing demand for
hauling commodities amid  China ’s economic slowdown and depressed
freight rates caused by a glut of vessels.  “Shipping industry fundamentals remain challenging and we
don’t see an industry recovery in second half based on the
current supply and demand outlook,” Citigroup Inc. analysts led
by Vivian Tao wrote in a note yesterday. “As such, we don’t
believe China Cosco will be able to turn profitable
operationally in second half.”  China Cosco, based in Tianjin, is restructuring assets in a
bid to return to profitability as a third straight annual loss
may result in shares being delisted at the stock exchange in
Shanghai. The company may gain 3 billion yuan from earlier
disposals of its logistics unit and a stake in a container maker
and may sell more assets, according to Tao.  China Cosco didn’t say when it will report interim results.  To contact the reporter on this story:
