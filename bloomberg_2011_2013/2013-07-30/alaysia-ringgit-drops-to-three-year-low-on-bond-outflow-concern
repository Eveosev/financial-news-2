Malaysia ’s ringgit fell to a three-year low on concern global investors will repatriate funds after
$2.9 billion of sovereign debt matures tomorrow.  The local-currency bonds “may have a large proportion of
foreign ownership” and capital outflows could cause the ringgit
to underperform, Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Credit Agricole CIB
strategist in Hong Kong, wrote in a research note today. The
yield on the government’s benchmark three-year  notes  ended
yesterday at the highest level since November 2008, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “One of the factors that is behind the depreciation in the
ringgit has been the large redemption of Malaysian government
securities,” said Khoon Goh, a senior strategist at  Australia &
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  in Singapore. “That has got the
market somewhat concerned that we’re going to see some large
outflows from the bond market.”  The ringgit declined 0.3 percent to 3.2365 per dollar as of
10:03 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It earlier touched 3.2379, the weakest level since
July 1, 2010. It has fallen for five straight days, the longest
losing streak since December 2012, and depreciated 2.4 percent
this month and 5.5 percent in 2013.  Global funds held 33 percent of Malaysian sovereign notes
in May, the highest proportion among Southeast Asia’s biggest
economies, according to central bank and finance ministry data.
This renders the nation’s securities vulnerable to a global
sell-off, Arjun Shetty, a rate strategist in  Singapore  at
Deutsche Bank AG, said last week.  Debt Auction  The government will auction 4.5 billion ringgit ($1.4
billion) of 2020 securities today, according to data published
on the central bank’s website.  The ringgit also weakened amid concern about a possible
deterioration of Malaysia’s current-account balance, Goh said.
The  surplus  fell to 8.7 billion ringgit in the January-March
period from 22.9 billion ringgit in the preceding three months,
official data show. The nation may record an $800 million
current-account deficit in the second quarter, the first
shortfall since 1997, according to a July 26 note from Bank of
America Merrill Lynch.  One-month implied volatility in the ringgit, a measure of
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, rose 16
basis points, or 0.16 percentage point, to 8.30 percent.  Government bonds declined. The yield on the 3.48 percent
notes due March 2023 climbed four basis points to 3.97 percent,
the highest since the notes were issued in March, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
