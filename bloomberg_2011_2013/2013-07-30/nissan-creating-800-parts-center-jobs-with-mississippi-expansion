Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , pushing to make 85
percent of vehicles its sells in the U.S. at North American
plants, said 800 jobs will be added at a parts facility being
built to aid its Mississippi auto-assembly plant.  Nissan breaks ground today for a parts and logistics
“park” at its Canton, Mississippi, plant that will employ 400
company workers and a further 400 people to be hired by
 suppliers , the Yokohama, Japan-based carmaker said in a
statement. Nissan will spend as much as $75 million on the
project, with added investment coming from Mississippi and
suppliers, said Justin Saia, a company spokesman, without
elaborating.  The move comes after Japan’s second-biggest automaker added
Sentra small-car production in Canton last month and as it
prepares to shift Murano sport-utility vehicle assembly to
Mississippi from  Japan . Nissan estimates that by the end of
2013, it will have added more than 6,000 manufacturing jobs in
the U.S. since mid-2011.  Japan’s automakers have benefited in the past year as the
yen’s 20 percent drop against the dollar lifted the value of
their U.S. sales. Nevertheless, Nissan,  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and
 Honda Motor Co. (7267)  are all raising North American production to
insulate themselves from currency swings and disruptions such as
the 2011 tsunami in Japan, which pared global parts supplies.  Nissan set a target last year of getting 85 percent of
vehicles its sells in the U.S. from within North America by
2015, up from 69 percent in 2011. The company’s North American
operations are based in Franklin, Tennessee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
