Western Union Co. (WU) , the world’s
biggest money-transfer business, said second-quarter profit fell
27 percent as revenue from transaction fees dropped and expenses
climbed.  Net income for the three months ended June 30 was $198.6
million, or 36 cents a share, compared with $271.2 million, or
44 cents, a year earlier, the Englewood, Colorado-based company
said today in a statement. The average estimate of 29 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was for earnings of 34 cents a share.  “The strategy we laid out at the beginning of the year is
working,” Chief Executive Officer Hikmet Ersek, 52, said in the
statement. “We affirmed our financial outlook for the full
year, and believe we are on target to return to revenue and
profit growth in 2014.”  Ersek said in February that revenue and profit growth would
be reduced in 2013 as the company invests in its online business
and cuts prices to stay competitive as consumers shift away from
cash. Shares have gained 25 percent this year, compared with the
18 percent advance of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
