JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  agreed to pay
$410 million, including giving up $125 million in profits, to
settle a U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission investigation
of energy-market manipulation in California and the Midwest.  The FERC announced the settlement with the New York-based
bank today in a statement, a day after the agencyâ€™s staff
formally accused a JPMorgan trading unit of wrongdoing from
September 2010 to June 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
