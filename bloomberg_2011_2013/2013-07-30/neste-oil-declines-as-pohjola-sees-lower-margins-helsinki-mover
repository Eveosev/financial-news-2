Neste Oil Oyj (NES1V) ,  Finland ’s only
refiner, dropped the most in four weeks as Pohjola Bank Oyj said
a slow European economy will hurt delivery volumes, with both
renewable and traditional fuel margins becoming tighter.  Neste Oil fell as much as 3 percent, the most since July 3.
Shares in the Espoo, Finland-based company declined 2.8 percent
to 10.83 euros by the close in Helsinki. Trading volume exceeded
the three-month daily average by about a third.  “We’ve lowered our second-half and 2014 forecasts to
correspond with a more cautious outlook on European traffic fuel
demand,” Henri Parkkinen, an analyst at Pohjola, said in a note
today. He lowered his 12-month price estimate to 12.50 euros
from 14 euros, keeping his recommendation at accumulate.  BP Plc (BP/)  said today it expects lower global refining margins
during the third quarter as a result of capacity additions and
refineries returning to production after outages.  Palm oil  gained the most in almost seven months today as
its recent decline attracted buyers. Neste Oil, which operates
the world’s largest palm oil plant in  Singapore , enjoys greater
profits when palm oil is cheap compared with rapeseed oil.  “Vegetable oil price differences have narrowed at the
start of the third quarter,” Parkkinen said. “We also prepare
for a lower-than-estimated second-half spread between Brent
crude oil and Russian Urals crude oil. The refining margin
estimates are based on an assumption of low hedging levels.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
