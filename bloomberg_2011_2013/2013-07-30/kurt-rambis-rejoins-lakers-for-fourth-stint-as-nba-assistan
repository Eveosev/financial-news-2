Kurt Rambis, who won four National
Basketball Association titles with the Los Angeles Lakers during
his playing career, has rejoined the team as an assistant coach
for the fourth time.  Rambis, 55, was hired with former Orlando Magic and
Philadelphia 76ers coach Johnny Davis to join coach Mike D’Antoni’s staff. Rambis spent last season as an NBA analyst for
ESPN and  Time Warner Cable (TWC)  Sportsnet.  “Kurt is a great basketball mind, extremely good at
working with big men and his experience as a head coach in this
league is going to prove very helpful to our staff,” D’Antoni
said today in a statement.  Rambis won NBA titles as a player with the Lakers in 1982,
1985, 1987 and 1988, and was first hired as an assistant with
the team in 1994 before taking over as coach 13 games into the
1998-99 season. He tied a then-NBA record with nine consecutive
wins to start his coaching career and led the team to a 24-13
mark and the Western Conference semifinals.  Rambis stayed with the Lakers through the 2009 season, with
two more stints as an assistant in addition to front-office
roles. He was the Minnesota Timberwolves’ coach from 2009 to
2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
