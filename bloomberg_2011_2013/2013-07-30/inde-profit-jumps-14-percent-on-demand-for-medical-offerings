Linde AG (LIN) , the German industrial
gases company that bought U.S. respiratory-therapy provider
Lincare last year, reported a 14 percent rise in second-quarter
profit on growing demand for health-care offerings.  Operating profit climbed to 1.01 billion euros ($1.3
billion) from 885 million euros a year earlier, the Munich-based
company said today in a statement. That matched the 1 billion-euro  estimate  of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue
increased 11 percent to 4.2 billion euros.  Linde is pushing into new markets to reduce reliance on
more cyclical products such as supplying oxygen and other gases
to welders and steel plants. The $3.8 billion acquisition of
Clearwater, Florida-based Lincare doubled Linde’s North America
gas sales, and it also bought the former home-care business of
 Air Products & Chemicals Inc. (APD)  in January 2012.  “Although the economic tailwind has subsided somewhat, we
have continued to achieve profitable growth,” Chief Executive
Officer Wolfgang Reitzle said. “The expansion of our health-care operations in particular made the greatest contribution
here.”  Linde reiterated this year’s target of at least 4 billion
euros in operating profit, which the company defines as earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and is
seeking a return on capital employed of about 14 percent in
2016. Reitzle is set to step down in May 2014.  The CEO is also pursuing savings intended to cut as much as
900 million euros in costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
