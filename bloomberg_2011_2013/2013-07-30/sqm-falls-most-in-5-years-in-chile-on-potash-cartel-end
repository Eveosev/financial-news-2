Soc.  Quimica y Minera  de  Chile  SA,
the country’s largest fertilizer producer, fell the most in 19
years after  Russia ’s OAO Uralkali said it would abandon a cartel
that underpinned prices for a principal ingredient.  SQM’s B shares retreated 17 percent to 15,738 pesos at the
close of trading in Santiago, the biggest fall since December
1994. Trading of SQM’s shares in Chile had been suspended
between 9:30 a.m. and 11 a.m. by the Santiago exchange.  Companies that make the soil nutrient potash tumbled
globally after Uralkali, the world’s largest producer, said it
would exit agreements that limited production.  Potash Corp of
Saskatchewan ,  Canada ’s largest producer, fell 16 percent in
Toronto, while Plymouth, Minnesota-based The Mosaic Co.
retreated 17 percent.  “This may lead to a price war,” Banchile Inversiones
wrote in a  note  posted on its website, saying potash could
retreat to $300 per ton from about $392 per ton. “For every $10
per ton drop, SQM’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization could retreat 2.5 percent.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
