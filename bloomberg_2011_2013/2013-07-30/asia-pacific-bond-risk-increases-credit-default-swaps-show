Bonds sold by  Poly Real Estate Group
Co. (600048) , the first U.S. dollar-denominated notes from a Chinese
issuer in almost eight weeks, fell in their first day of
trading. Asia bond risk climbed.  The Guangzhou-based developer sold $500 million of five-year bonds at 99.061 cents on the dollar yesterday, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The securities were quoted as low as
98.529 cents on the dollar today before rallying to 98.98  as of
10:36 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices.  The cost of insuring corporate and sovereign bonds in the
Asia-Pacific region using credit-default swaps climbed today as
warnings  China  could miss its 7.5 percent yearly growth target
intensify. Expansion trailed 2013 targets in 17 of 30 provinces
and provincial-level cities in the January-to-June period,
compared with 14 of 31 in last year’s first half, according to
data compiled by  Bloomberg News .  “Despite the early weakness, this deal is hardly a
disaster,” said Mark Reade, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Credit
Agricole CIB. “Maybe this will just take some time to digest.”  Poly Real Estate’s sale was the first by a Chinese company
in the U.S. currency since China Huaneng Group Corp. raised debt
on June 4, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Investors offered to
buy more than three times the number of notes available in the
offering yesterday.  Bond Risk  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  climbed 3 basis points to 146 basis
points as of 8:18 a.m. in  Singapore ,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) 
prices show. The benchmark is headed for its highest close since
July 12 and is down from 152.4 basis points at the start of the
month, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 3 basis points to
123 as of 10:19 a.m. in Sydney, according to National Australia
Bank Ltd. prices. The measure is on track to close at its
highest level since July 17, according to CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market. It’s poised to have fallen 14.1
basis points from June 30 and has ranged from 96.1 to 149.5 this
year, CMA prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Japan increased 1 basis point to 102
basis points as of 9:19 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup
Inc. The gauge, which has ranged from 90.9 to 110.2 this month,
is poised for its highest close since July 10, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
