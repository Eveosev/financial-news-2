U.K. stocks  rose for a second day as
companies from  GKN Plc (GKN)  to  ITV (ITV)  Plc reported sales that beat
analysts’ estimates, while investors awaited the outcome of the
Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting.  GKN jumped to its highest price since at least 1988 as
Boeing Co. and Airbus SAS ordered more parts. ITV climbed to a
record price after posting  earnings per share  that also exceeded
analysts’ projections for the first half of 2013.  Barclays Plc (BARC) 
fell the most in 13 months after saying it will raise 5.8
billion pounds ($8.9 billion) in a rights offering.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  added 10.7 points, or 0.2 percent, to
6,570.95 at the close of trading in  London , after earlier
advancing as much as 0.6 percent. The gauge has risen 5.7
percent in July as the  Federal Reserve  said it remains flexible
on the pace of its bond-buying program. The broader FTSE All-Share Index increased 0.2 percent, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index
gained 0.4 percent.  “There have been some good corporate results today and
both ITV and Next stand out as two economically sensitive
businesses where the outlook remains strong,” Matthew Beesley,
the London-based head of equities at Henderson Global Investors
Holdings Ltd. which overseas about $100 billion, wrote in a
message.  “For the FTSE 100 to move up from current levels, we
are going to need to see good news from the other high-street
banks when they report.”  The volume of shares changing hands in companies on the
FTSE 100 today was 6.1 percent greater than the average of the
past 30 days, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Rate Decisions  The Fed will announce its interest-rate decision after the
close of European trading tomorrow. The  European Central Bank 
and the  Bank of England  announce policy decisions on Thursday.  GKN surged 6.5 percent to 348.5 pence. The supplier of
aircraft parts reported that sales gained 12 percent to 3.9
billion pounds in the first half, beating the  average analyst
estimate  of 3.7 billion pounds. Pretax profit advanced 5 percent
to 278 million pounds in the six-month period. Boeing and Airbus
have increased their output to record levels, benefiting major
suppliers such as GKN.  ITV rose 6.3 percent to 167 pence, the highest price since
the company was formed from the merger of Granada Plc and
Carlton Communications Plc in 2004. The broadcaster said first-half revenue climbed 2.3 percent to 1.31 billion pounds, beating

profit of as much as 665 million pounds.  International Personal Finance Plc (IPF)  jumped 15 percent to 647
pence. The home-credit business, which offers unsecured loans to
low-income households in eastern  Europe  and  Mexico , posted
first-half pretax profit that beat estimates. It also  announced
a share-buyback program.  Barclays, BP  Barclays slid 5.7 percent to 291.3 pence after announcing
