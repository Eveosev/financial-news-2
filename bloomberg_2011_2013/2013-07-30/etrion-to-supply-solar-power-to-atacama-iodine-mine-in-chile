Etrion Corp. (ETX) , a Geneva-based
renewable-energy producer, agreed to supply solar power to an
iodine mine in northern  Chile  operated by Atacama Minerals Chile
SCM.  Etrion will build and operate a solar farm with as much as
8.8 megawatts of capacity, enough to power 35 percent of the
Aguas Blancas mine, according to a statement today. The plant is
expected to begin producing power in the second quarter of 2014
and will cost an estimated $25 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
