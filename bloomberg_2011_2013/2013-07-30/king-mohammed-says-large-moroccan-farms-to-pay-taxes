Morocco’s King Mohammed says a
three-decade  tax exemption  will end this year for large
agribusinesses, which include those owned by the royal family.  Small- and medium-sized farms will retain the exemption as
the country seeks to boost revenue after its  budget deficit 
surged to 7.5% last year, the highest since the 1990s.  The 49 year-old monarch, giving his annual televised
enthronement speech, did not specify the boundaries between
large, medium and small farm businesses. King Mohammed leads the
council of ministers, giving him substantial executive
authority.  Morocco this year initiated tax reforms aimed mostly at
limiting  tax evasion  in business. The sector contributes around
15 percent of the $100-billion economy and accounts for about 40
percent of the country’s total workforce.  More than 85 percent of Moroccan farms are less than 5
hectares, while 70 percent cover less than two hectares,
agriculture ministry data shows.  Through its Domaines Royaux offshoot,  Morocco ’s ruling
Alaouite dynasty is one of Morocco’s biggest exporters of fresh
produce and a key player in domestic agribusiness.  To contact the reporter on this story:
