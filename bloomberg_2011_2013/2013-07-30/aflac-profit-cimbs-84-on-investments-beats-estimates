Aflac Inc. (AFL) , the largest seller of
supplemental health insurance, said second-quarter  profit  rose
84 percent as investment results improved.  Net income  climbed to $889 million, or $1.90 a share, from
$483 million, or $1.03, a year earlier, the Columbus, Georgia-based insurer said today in a statement.  Operating profit , which
excludes some investment results, was $1.62 a share, beating the
$1.51  average estimate  of 21 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Aflac, which counts  Japan  as its  largest market , cut
investments in European nations to limit risk after soured bets
on bonds from financial firms in Iceland and  Greece . Realized
investment gains added $130 million to profit, compared with
losses of $272 million a year earlier when the company recorded
impairments on Spanish holdings.  “Aflac’s investment portfolio has been completely
retooled,” Tony Scherrer, director of research at Smead Capital
Management, which oversees about $600 million including Aflac
shares, said in an e-mail before results were announced.  The insurer said today it would allocate most of third-quarter  cash flow  to Japan government bonds, with less of an
investment in U.S. corporate debt. The strategy is a reversal
from plans discussed by the insurer as recently as May.  “In light of the financial market volatility in both
the  United States  and Japan in the second quarter, our
investment team has been carefully evaluating investment
options,” the company said in the statement. “We remain
committed to further building out our investment functions and
capabilities to enable us to respond to a changing economic
environment.”  Book Value  Book value, a measure of assets minus liabilities, fell to
$29.46 a share from $33.34 on March 31 as the value of Aflac’s
investment portfolio declined, fueled by a rise in  interest
rates  and the yen’s weakening against the dollar.  Aflac  advanced  15 percent this year through 4 p.m.,
trailing the 35 percent gain of the 24-company KBW Insurance
Index. The company said in May it plans to  repurchase  $600
million of shares in 2013, the top end of an earlier projection.  In Japan, total new annualized premium sales fell 43
percent after Aflac raised prices for some products. That
compares with a 47 percent gain in the second quarter of 2012.
Some customers chose to invest in stocks and bonds rather than
insurance products as returns improved, Aflac Chief Executive
Officer Dan Amos said in the statement.  The insurer reached a deal last week with Japan Post
Holdings Co. to sell policies in as many as 20,000 post offices.
Aflac, the exclusive provider of cancer insurance through
Japanese post offices, currently offers the coverage in about
1,000 locations. The companies may also work together to design
insurance products, according to a July 26 statement.  Aflac converts results from yen to dollars for reporting
purposes. The yen traded at 99.14 per dollar on June 28, weaker
than the 79.79 level at the middle of 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
