Alec Baldwin  ordered the cherries.  Martha Stewart  recognized her cake stands displaying home-baked chocolate chip cookies. And the lemonade? Just 50 cents, one of the best (and only) bargains on the East End.  The entrepreneurs who set up shop on Ocean Avenue in  East Hampton  on Saturday afternoon were Pippa and Ella Nussbaum. Mom is Darcy Miller, editorial director of  Martha Stewart Weddings (MSO)  and a celebrations expert, who helped with promotion and decorating. Dad is Andy Nussbaum, a partner at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and the brother of Peter Nussbaum, general counsel of SAC Capital Advisors LP, who probably didn’t have much time to sip lemonade over the weekend.  A great location near the beach, accomplished hula-hooping demonstrations, and a cute little yellow taxi cab attracted customers. One brisk period brought a swimming instructor, a mom driving by in her  Mini Cooper  with the top down, a producer on his motorcycle and a gardener.  A big order came from two girls in bathing suits: five lemonades and three cookies. Mom helped figure out the change due on a $5. A portion of the stand’s proceeds will support  Mount Sinai’s  pediatric endocrinology department.  Take that lemonade stand and multiply it by, say, 200, and you have an idea of what Super Saturday was like. More than 200 brands set up under a tent in Water Mill on Saturday, offering clothes and accessories at a discount, as well as ice cream,  Hampton Coffee Company  iced coffee, and psychic readings for free (after an admission fee).  DKNY Purse  One 42-year-old merchandiser spent about $800 shopping from 12:15 p.m. to 5 p.m. with a break for lunch in an air-conditioned tent. Her 15-year-old daughter held up her prize bargain: a DKNY purse for $25. The pair also shopped at the stands of  Alice + Olivia , Milly and Trina Turk.  As pink receipts piled up on spikes for sequined gowns, ties, pillows, the  Ovarian Cancer Research Fund  raised more than $3.5 million, with major support from InStyle magazine and QVC.  Shoppers will have another chance to do good on Thursday, Aug. 1 at United Jewish Appeal- New York  Federation’s  trunk show  in Bridgehampton. Twenty percent of sales on  Nathan & Moe  jewelry,  Theodora & Callum  scarves and some 70 other vendors will go to UJA.  Marc Leder of Sun Capital Partners Inc. attended the  Rush Philanthropic Arts Foundation  “Art for Life” benefit. The event on Saturday honored, among others, Creative Time’s Anne Pasternak, filmmaker Tyler Perry, and author  Walter Mosley .  Also helping raise $1.5 million were Julie Macklowe, whose  Vbeaute  has the full window display at White’s Pharmacy in downtown East Hampton, and Estelle. Leder is a past honoree of the benefit as well as a trustee of the foundation created by brothers Russell and Danny Simmons. It teaches art to underprivileged children in New York and exhibits emerging artists.
