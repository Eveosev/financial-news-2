Tullett Prebon Plc (TLPR) , a London-based
inter-dealer broker, said first-half profit fell 5.4 percent
after a drop in revenue from trading in foreign exchange and
bonds.  Underlying pretax profit in the six months to June 30
slipped to 62.8 million pounds ($96 million) from 66.4 million
pounds a year earlier, the company said in a statement today.
Revenue fell to 439.8 million pounds from 455.1 million pounds.
It will pay an interim dividend of 5.6 pence a share.  “Activity in the financial markets has been subdued for
the last twelve months,” Chief Executive Officer  Terry Smith 
said in the statement. “There was some pick-up in the level of
activity toward the end of the first half, but it would be
prudent to expect that market conditions will continue to be
challenging.”  Inter-dealer brokers such as Tullett and  ICAP Plc (IAP)  act as a
go-between for banks that trade bonds, stocks, currencies,
energy and derivatives. Profits have been squeezed as regulators
push more trading onto exchanges and financial markets remain
subdued during the sovereign debt crisis.  Revenue from treasury products, which includes currency and
money markets, fell to 115.4 million pounds from 121.4 million
pounds a year ago, reflecting a drop in trading FX forwards such
as in  Asia , the company said. Fixed income revenues also
declined as banks reduced activity in corporate bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
