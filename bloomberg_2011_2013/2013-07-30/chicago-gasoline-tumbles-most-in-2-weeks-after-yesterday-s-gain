Chicago  gasoline weakened versus
futures by the most in almost two weeks on speculation that
yesterday’s gain was overdone.  Conventional, 85-octane gasoline , or CBOB, in Chicago slid
7 cents to 11.5 cents a gallon under New York Mercantile
Exchange gasoline futures at 4:13 p.m., the biggest drop since
July 15, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The discount
narrowed 6.25 cents yesterday after  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  reduced
rates at its Joliet, Illinois, refinery.  “Yesterday’s strength is part of the story for today’s
weakness,” Ken Malloy, a broker with Danaher Oil Co., said by
phone from Fairfield,  Iowa . “With the Exxon news in the
market” and other refiners buying too, the markets traded
higher yesterday, he said in an e-mail.  Exxon’s  Joliet refinery  is the fifth-largest in the U.S.
Midwest with a capacity of 238,000 barrels a day, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It primarily produces gasoline and
diesel for the Midwest, the company’s website shows.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  in Chicago, a rough measure of
refining margins for gasoline and diesel based on West Texas
Intermediate oil in Cushing, Oklahoma, dropped 64 cents to
$18.78 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
