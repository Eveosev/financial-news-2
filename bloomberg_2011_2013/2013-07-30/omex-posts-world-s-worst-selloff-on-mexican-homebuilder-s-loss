Desarrolladora Homex SAB (HOMEX*) ,  Mexico ’s
biggest homebuilder by 2012 revenue, plunged to a record low,
extending a three-day selloff that has been the steepest in the
world.  The shares fell 13 percent to 2.76 pesos at 12:12 p.m. in
Mexico City, pushing the three-day plunge to 58 percent, the
most among 2,588 securities on the Bloomberg World Index with
average daily trading volume exceeding 1 million shares in the
past 30 days.  The builder said July 25 that it had losses of 10.2 billion
pesos ($800 million) in the second quarter. The deficit was the
Culiacan, Mexico-based company’s biggest on record and exceeded
the average projection for a 29 million peso loss among analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Homex said in a regulatory filing that it
didn’t have any additional information to explain today’s rout.  Mexico’s three biggest homebuilders have hired advisers to
restructure debt after changes in government housing policy led
to a dropoff in sales and a shift to more capital-intensive
apartment construction, depleting cash balances.  The shares of competitors  Corp. Geo SAB (GEOB)  and  Urbi
Desarrollos Urbanos SAB (URBI*)  were suspended from trading after they
failed to meet the Mexican stock exchange’s deadline last week
for reporting second-quarter results.  To contact the reporter on this story:
