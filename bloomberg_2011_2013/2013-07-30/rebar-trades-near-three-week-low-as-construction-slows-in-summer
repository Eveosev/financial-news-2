Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  traded near a three-week low as summer heat slowed
construction in  China , curbing demand for the building material.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange swung between gains and losses of at least 0.2 percent
before trading little changed at 3,642 yuan ($594) a metric ton.
Futures tumbled to 3,627 yuan yesterday, the lowest price since
July 10.  Southern China provinces have had temperatures as high as
41 degrees Celsius (106 degrees Fahrenheit) for a month now,
according to the National Meteorological Center. Temperatures in
northwestern Xinjiang also surged in recent days, it said.  “Buying of rebar has been declining every day as the heat
curbs construction,” said Wang Yongliang, an analyst at Beijing
Cifco Futures Co. in Tianjin.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port fell 0.7
percent to $131.70 a ton yesterday, according to The Steel Index
Ltd. The average  spot price  for rebar was little changed at
3,467  yuan  yesterday, according to data from Beijing Antaike
