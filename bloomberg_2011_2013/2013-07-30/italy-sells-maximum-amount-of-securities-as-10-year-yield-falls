Italy  sold the maximum amount
offered at a sale of five and 10-year debt today as investors
shrugged off potential risks to the government’s survival from
an eventual conviction of former premier  Silvio Berlusconi  in a
tax-fraud case.  Italy sold 3.75 billion euros ($4.97 billion) of a new 10-year bond maturing in March 2024 at 4.46 percent, down from 4.55
percent when Italy sold similar-maturity debt last month. The
Rome-based Treasury also sold 2018 bonds at 3.22 percent, down
from 3.47 percent at a June 27 auction.  Investors bid for 1.36 times the amount of five-year debt
for sale and for 1.32 times the amount of the 10-year
securities, compared with 1.30 and 1.46 at the previous sale,
respectively. The sale was probably supported by about 25
billion euros of bond redemptions Aug. 1.  “All in all, both lines were decently bid,” Annalisa
Piazza, a fixed-income analyst at Newedge Group in  London , said
in a note to clients after the sale.  Day of Truth  Investors are waiting for Italy’s highest court to rule on
Berlusconi’s appeal of a tax-fraud case involving his  Mediaset
SpA (MS) , which may come as soon as today. A conviction carries a
four-year prison sentence and a five-year ban from public
office. While the three-time premier probably won’t serve any
prison time, an upheld conviction may mark the end of his
political career and may exacerbate tensions in Prime Minister
Enrico Letta’s coalition.  While Berlusconi has repeatedly said he won’t bring down
the government, some of his allies have threatened to pull the
plug on Letta’s administration in case of a final conviction.  “We think the odds are against a breakdown of the
coalition at this time,” UniCredit economist Loredana Federico
wrote in a note to clients yesterday. “This week’s ruling and
the successive decision” by the Senate, which will have to vote
to end Berlusconi’s mandate as a senator, need to be watched
closely’’  Italy’s 10-year bond yield dropped 5 basis points to 4.41
percent at 11:20 a.m. in  Rome , pushing the difference with
comparable-maturing German Bunds to 275 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
