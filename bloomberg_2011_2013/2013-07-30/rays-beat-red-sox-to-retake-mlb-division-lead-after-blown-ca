The Tampa Bay Rays defeated the
Boston Red Sox 2-1 with the help of a blown call at home plate
to retake first place in the American League Eastern Division.  Rays starting pitcher  David Price  allowed one run and two
hits over 7 1/3 innings last night at Boston’s Fenway Park to
beat the Red Sox for the second time in six days.  With runners on second and third base with one out in the
bottom of the eighth inning, Boston missed a chance to tie when
pinch-runner Daniel Nava was ruled out at home plate on a
sacrifice fly. Red Sox manager John Farrell was ejected by home
plate umpire Jerry Meals after arguing the call. Replays showed
that Nava had slid in safely under the tag of Rays catcher Jose Molina and Meals said after the game he made a mistake.  The Rays improved their record to 63-43 with the win,
moving a half-game over the Red Sox (63-44) atop  Major League
Baseball ’s AL East.  The  Texas Rangers  halted a four-game losing skid with a 4-3
win over the  Los Angeles Angels  in which A.J. Pierzynski and
Geovany Soto hit ninth-inning home runs.  The Pittsburgh Pirates pulled within a half-game of the
National League Central-leading St. Louis Cardinals as  Francisco Liriano  allowed one run over seven innings in a 9-2 victory. It
was the Cardinals’ fourth straight loss.  The Atlanta Braves pushed their winning streak to four
games by beating the Colorado Rockies 9-8 on a run-scoring,
10th-inning triple by Andrelton Simmons, and the  New York  Mets
scored three runs in the seventh inning to beat the Miami
Marlins 6-5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
