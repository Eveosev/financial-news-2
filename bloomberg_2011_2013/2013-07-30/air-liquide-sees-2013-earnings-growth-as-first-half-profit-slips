Air Liquide SA (AI) , the French maker of
industrial gases, reiterated its forecast for profit growth in
2013 as sales rebounded in the second quarter.  Net income declined to 752 million euros ($997 million) in
the first half from 784 million euros a year earlier amid a 50-million euro restructuring charge linked to job cuts in  Europe ,
the Paris-based company said today in a statement. The average
 estimate  in a Bloomberg survey of five analysts was 736 million
euros. Adjusted operating profit climbed 0.9 percent.  The operating performance “is the result of the
improvement in activity observed in the second quarter,” Chief
Executive Officer Benoit Potier said in the statement. “Baring
a degradation of the environment, Air Liquide is confident in
its ability to deliver another year of net profit growth in
2013.”  The CEO has said he will unveil a strategy this December to
manage the challenges of Europe’s economic woes, growing
industrial capacity in  emerging markets , cheaper U.S. gas, and
rising demand for health-care services and electronic goods such
as tablets. In February, the group raised its savings target for
the period from 2011 to 2015 by 30 percent to 1.3 billion euros.  Air Liquide’s second-quarter sales of gas and services rose
5.6 percent, excluding the effects of natural-gas prices, and
currency shifts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
