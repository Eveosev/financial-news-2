German stocks  advanced for a second
day as  Linde AG (LIN)  and  Infineon Technologies AG (IFX)  reported increased
quarterly operating profit, while investors awaited the outcomes
of central-bank meetings later this week.  Linde climbed 1.8 percent after the industrial-gases
company reported that operating profit rose 14 percent in the
second quarter. Infineon gained 2.4 percent as the chipmaker
also raised its sales forecast. Deutsche Bank AG fell 1.9
percent after Germany’s biggest bank posted second-quarter
profit that missed analysts’ estimates.  K+S AG (SDF)  slumped 14
percent as OAO Uralkali forecast that potash prices will drop.  The  DAX (DAX)  added 0.7 percent to 8,319.48 at 10:06 a.m. in
Frankfurt, extending its rally so far in July to 4.6 percent.
The equity benchmark has climbed 8.3 percent from a low on June
24. The broader HDAX Index also increased 0.7 percent today.  “German stocks are dominated by earnings today,” Soeren Steinert, who helps manage about $24 billion as associate
director for equities trading at Quoniam Asset Management GmbH
in Frankfurt, wrote in an e-mail. “Infineon Technologies and
Linde reported good results.”  In the U.S., the Federal Reserve starts a two-day meeting
today. The  European Central Bank  and the Bank of England
announce policy decisions on Thursday.  The volume of shares changing hands in DAX-listed companies
was 86 percent greater than the average of the past 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
