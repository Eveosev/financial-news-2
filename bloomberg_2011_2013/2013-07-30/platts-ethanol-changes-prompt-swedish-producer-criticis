Lantmannen Agroetanol AB , a Swedish
ethanol producer, criticized changes by Platts to the way the
publisher will assess prices in  Europe ’s biofuel market.  The new method, based on the time barges spend when loading
ethanol in Rotterdam, is “totally unacceptable” because it
will raise costs, complicate corporate planning and penalize
buyers who will need to rent tankers on short notice, Erik
Werner, a senior trader at the Hanholmsvägen, Sweden-based
company, said in an e-mailed statement.  Platts, the New York-based price-reporting agency owned by
 McGraw Hill Financial Inc. (MHFI) , said in a July 16 presentation it
may determine benchmark prices for ethanol, a biofuel derived
from corn or sugar, by looking at barges that load in three
separate five-day slots instead of over a 13-day period. The
change would better reflect the fuel’s value by taking into
account its price in more precise timeframes, according to
Platts. That move was confirmed yesterday in a note on Platts’s
website and will take effect Aug. 1.  “Suggested changes to the ethanol market of the European
Union are beyond comprehension,” Werner said in the July 17
statement. Platts should extend the loading period it uses for
assessments to a full month and prolong consultations on the
changes with industry participants until December, he said at
the time.  Regularly Engage  Platts, which publishes the Dated Brent benchmark that
helps determine the price of more than half the world’s oil,
said it “regularly engages with a broad array of market
participants about the markets it covers,” Kathleen Tanzy, a
New York-based spokeswoman for the company, said in an e-mailed
response to questions about the proposal on July 18.  Lantmannen is  Sweden ’s only “large-scale” producer of
grain-based ethanol for blending into fuel, according to its
website.  Bloomberg LP, the parent of  Bloomberg News , competes with
Platts and other companies in providing energy-markets news and
information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
