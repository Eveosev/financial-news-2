Pandora A/S (PNDORA) , a Danish maker of
bracelets and charms, raised sales and profitability forecasts
for 2013 after revenue rose in the first half following a
product revamp.  The jewelry manufacturer anticipates revenue of about 8
billion kroner ($1.4 billion) this year, compared with a
previous target of more than 7.2 billion kroner, Pandora said in
a statement today. The Glostrup, Denmark-based company forecast
a margin on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization of about 27 percent, compared with previous
expectations to exceed 25 percent. Pandora shares rose as much
as 5 percent.  “They sent a very strong signal to the market with a very
strong second quarter, way above the market expectations with
good growth in major markets,’ said Soeren Loentoft Hansen, an
analyst at  Sydbank A/S. (SYDB)   The company said today that performance has been ‘‘solid’’
in the second quarter and into July, with revenue growth across
all major regions. Pandora shares have advanced 78 percent this
year on improved profit as the jewelry maker has cut prices and
replaced unwanted products after suffering a collapse of demand
two years ago.  The jewelry maker will report full second-quarter earnings
Aug. 13. Pandora said revenue in the period was about 1.9
billion kroner and the Ebitda margin was about 27 percent. The
average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg was for
second-quarter revenue of 1.57 billion kroner.  Pandora said it expects to open about 175 concept stores
this year, up from previous estimates for 150, and expects
capital expenditure to be about 400 million kroner instead of
300 million kroner as the company expands its production
facilities in  Thailand .  The shares traded 3.5 percent higher at 221.60 kroner as of
9:44 a.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
