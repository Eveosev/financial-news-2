Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s Scotford
refinery will shut down for planned maintenance in September,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  The 97,870-barrel-a-day  refinery  located near  Edmonton ,
Alberta, will idle its crude distillation units for
approximately the entire month, according to the person, who
asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public.  The plant produces gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and propane
from synthetic light crude, according to the company’s  website .
It’s part of the Shell Scotford Complex in Fort Saskatchewan,
which also includes a 255,000-barrel-a-day upgrader that makes
synthetic crude from oil-sands bitumen.  Shell representatives didn’t immediately respond to
requests for comment.  Syncrude synthetic light crude strengthened by 85 cents to
a premium of $1.10 a barrel to U.S. West Texas Intermediate as
of 12:18 p.m.  New York  time today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
