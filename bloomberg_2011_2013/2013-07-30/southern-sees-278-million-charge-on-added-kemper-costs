Southern Co. said additional cost
overruns at its proposed coal-gasification plant in  Mississippi 
will result in a $278 million charge to its second-quarter
earnings.  Costs for the Kemper power plant increased 13 percent to
$3.87 billion from an April estimate of $3.42 billion, the
Atlanta-based company said today in a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. Southern canâ€™t recover any
costs that exceed $2.88 billion under a settlement it reached
with Mississippi regulators earlier this year.  Southern may see additional construction costs or delays
with its Kemper plant, the company said in the filing. The
company, which is scheduled to report earnings tomorrow, plans
to meet a scheduled in-service date of May 2014 for the plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
