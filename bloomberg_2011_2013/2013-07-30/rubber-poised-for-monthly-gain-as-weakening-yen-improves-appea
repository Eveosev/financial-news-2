Rubber was poised for the first
monthly gain in six as a weakening Japanese currency improved
the appeal of yen-denominated contracts.  The contract for delivery in January rose as much as 2.4
percent to 246.4 yen a kilogram ($2,512 a metric ton) on the
Tokyo Commodity Exchange and was at 242.5 yen at 11:48 a.m.
Futures have gained 3.1 percent this month, paring losses this
year to 20 percent.  The yen weakened to 98.22 per dollar, heading for its first
drop in four days, as Asian stocks rebounded, offsetting a
bigger-than-estimated decline in Japanese factory output. The
Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index headed for its biggest monthly
decline in more than a year before a two-day Federal Open Market
Committee meeting begins.  “Rubber rebounded on the weaker yen ahead of the FOMC
meeting,” said Gu Jiong, an analyst at commodity broker Yutaka
Shoji Co. Lower-than-expected data from  Japan  raised optimism
that the government may increase stimulus, he added.  Rubber for January delivery added 0.3 percent to 17,670
 yuan  ($2,880) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Thai
rubber free-on-board fell 1.3 percent to 78 baht ($2.49) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
