A case of Chateau Lynch-Bages 2000,
a wine estate in the Pauillac district of Bordeaux, sold for
1,700 pounds ($2,610) on Liv-ex, its highest level for 12 weeks,
amid investor appetite for older vintages from the region.  The transaction on July 26 was 4 percent above its mid-June
level and 13 percent more than the level at which it traded on
the market last November, according to Liv-ex data.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index has risen 4 percent this
year, with gains in the 10 weeks to mid-March pared by a drop
since then. While the index, a benchmark for top wines from
Bordeaux, is heading for its fourth straight month of declines
following a muted response to the sales campaign for the
region’s 2012 wine futures, appetite persists for back vintages.  “After a strong start to the year the Liv-ex 50 has
started to drift,” Liv-ex said in a commentary on its market
blog.  The 2000 vintage of Chateau Lynch-Bages is its most
expensive of the past 20 years, according to merchant prices
collated by  Liv-ex  on its Cellar Watch website.  The wine was awarded a 97 rating on a 100-point scale by
U.S. critic  Robert Parker , making it the second-highest ranked
of the estate’s vintages during that period after the 2009,
according to the eRobertParker.com  website .  Fifth Growth  Chateau Lynch-Bages has almost 100 hectares (247 acres)
planted with vines, predominantly Cabernet Sauvignon along with
Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot.  The vineyard is on the left bank of the Gironde estuary and
ranks as a fifth growth among the Bordeaux estates listed in the
Medoc classification drawn up for Napoleon III’s 1855 Paris
Exhibition.  Its vineyards date back to at least the 18th century and
the estate has been under the control of the Cazes family since
the Second World War.  To contact the reporter on this story:
