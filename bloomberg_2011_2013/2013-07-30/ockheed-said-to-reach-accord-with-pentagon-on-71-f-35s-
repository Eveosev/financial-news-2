Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  reached an
agreement in principle today with the Pentagon to sell 71 more
F-35 fighters in two contracts valued at as much as $7 billion,
according to two people familiar with the deal.  The Pentagon will release as early as tomorrow a statement
disclosing what one of the people called a handshake agreement
that didn’t set final prices or terms and conditions. The people
spoke on condition of anonymity in advance of the official
announcement.  The details will be worked out by the end of August, the
person said. The deal for the next two contracts -- lots six and
seven of the initial production phase -- had been predicted by
Pentagon officials and by Marillyn Hewson, chief executive
officer of Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed. The fifth
contract, for 32 planes, was valued at as much as $3.8 billion.  “We believe we can have a negotiation settlement” by May
31, “followed by final contract award in June,” Air Force
Lieutenant General Christopher Bogdan, the program manager, had
said in written testimony submitted April 25 to a Senate Armed
Services Committee panel.  Pentagon officials were able to negotiate the price down
enough to buy the planned number of aircraft within the
constraints imposed by the budget-cutting process called
sequestration, one of the people said.  The agreement on the F-35 was reported earlier today by
Reuters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
