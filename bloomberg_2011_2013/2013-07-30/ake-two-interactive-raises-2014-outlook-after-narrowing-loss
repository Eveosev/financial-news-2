Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. (TTWO) ,
publisher of the “Grand Theft Auto” video games, reported
first-quarter results that beat analysts’ estimates. The stock
rose after the company boosted its full-year outlook.  The loss for the quarter, excluding items, was 54 cents a
share, New York-based Take-Two said in a statement yesterday.
That was narrower than the 57-cent loss seen on average by 17
analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Sales excluding items fell to
$144.3 million, exceeding the $124.8 million average  estimate .  The net loss for the quarter shrank to $61.9 million, or 71
cents a share, in the period ended June 30, from $110.8 million,
or $1.30 a share, a year earlier.  The next installment of the company’s top-selling “Grand
Theft Auto” goes on sale Sept. 17. For the year, the company
projects $2.25 to $2.50 a share in profit, excluding items, on
sales of as much as $1.88 billion on that basis.  Take-Two  rose  1.2 percent to $17.20 in extended trading
yesterday, after closing little changed at $16.99 in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
