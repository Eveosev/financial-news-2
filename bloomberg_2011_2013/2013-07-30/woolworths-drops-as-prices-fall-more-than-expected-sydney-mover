Woolworths Ltd. (WOW) ,  Australia ’s largest
retailer, fell in Sydney trading after its domestic food and
liquor prices declined more than analysts expected last quarter.  Woolworths shares fell as much as 4 percent and closed 1.6
percent lower at A$33.22. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index rose 1
point to 5,047.2 at the close of trading in Sydney.  Average prices at the company’s Australian food and liquor
business fell 3.5 percent in the quarter ended June 30, while
prices over the year dropped 2.9 percent, Sydney-based
Woolworths said in a  statement  today. Prices were expected to
drop 2.5 percent in the quarter, based on the median of three
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “Challenging economic conditions were particularly evident
as the quarter progressed,” Chief Executive Officer Grant
O’Brien said in the statement. The period was “underpinned by
consumer uncertainty and low growth in disposable income.”  Australian  consumer confidence  has softened amid the end of
a mining boom and a weaker local currency. Total fiscal fourth-quarter sales at Woolworths, which also owns the Big W chain,
climbed less than 1 percent to A$14.1 billion ($12.8 billion),
when adjusted for an extra week this year. The result was
“underwhelming,” Patersons Securities Ltd. said in a report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
