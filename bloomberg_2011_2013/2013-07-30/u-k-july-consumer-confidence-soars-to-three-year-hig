U.K.  consumer confidence  rose to the
highest in more than three years as Britons’ optimism about the
economic outlook improved.  A consumer sentiment index by GfK NOP Ltd. rose 5 points to
minus 16, the highest since April 2010, the London-based group
said in a report published today.  The economic recovery gained traction in the second quarter
as gross domestic product growth  accelerated to 0.6 percent .
 Bank of England  policy makers meeting tomorrow will probably
maintain stimulus levels as they consider introducing forward
guidance to cement the expansion.  “There is now no doubt that consumer confidence has
recovered strongly from the unparalleled trough of the last five
years,” Nick Moon, managing director of social research at GfK,
said in the report. “The current trend is definitely upwards.”  GfK’s measure of people’s assessment of the general
economic situation in the next 12 months rose 7 points to minus
9. A gauge of their optimism about their own finances in the
same period rose 7 points to 0.  An index of sentiment about the general economic situation
over the past 12 months rose 7 points to minus 35, and a gauge
of personal finances over the same period rose 5 points to minus
16. A measure of the climate for making major purchases fell 1
point to minus 21.  GfK interviewed 2,004 people from July 2 to July 21. The
poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
