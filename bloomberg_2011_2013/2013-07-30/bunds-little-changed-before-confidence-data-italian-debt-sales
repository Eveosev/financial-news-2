Italy ’s 10-year government bonds
rose for the first time in six days as the country’s borrowing
costs declined at a debt sale, the last auction of conventional
securities for four weeks.  Italy’s  benchmark yields  dropped from the highest in a week
as the nation matched the maximum target of 6.75 billion ($8.95
billion) euros at its offering of June 2018 and March 2024 debt.
Spanish bonds also rose. German bunds were little changed as a
report showed euro-area  economic confidence  improved this month,
weakening the case for more central-bank stimulus. The Bloomberg
Eurozone Sovereign Bond Index rose 0.7 percent in July through
yesterday, after losing the most in 18 months in June.  “What we’ve seen over the past couple of weeks is
basically that underlying market sentiment continues to be quite
robust,” said Elwin de Groot, senior market economist at
Rabobank Nederland in Utrecht, the Netherlands. “The Italian
and Spanish bonds are benefiting from that.”  Italy’s 10-year  yield  fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 4.40 percent at 4:58 p.m. London time after
climbing 14 basis points in the past five days. The 4.5 percent
bond due in May 2023 rose 0.41, or 4.10 euros per 1,000-euro
face amount, to 101.125.  Italy sold 3.75 billion euros of a new 10-year bond at 4.46
percent, down from 4.55 percent when it auctioned similar-maturity debt on June 27. The Rome-based Treasury allotted the
2018 bonds at 3.22 percent, down from 3.47 percent. Italy is due
to pay about 44 billion euros of coupons and redemptions next
month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Berlusconi’s Allies  Demand for Italy’s bonds held up at the auction before a
verdict from the nation’s highest court in former premier Silvio Berlusconi’s appeal of a tax-fraud case.  While Berlusconi has repeatedly said he won’t bring down
the government, some of his allies have threatened Prime
Minister Enrico Letta’s administration in case of a final
conviction.  Italian bonds returned 1 percent this month through
yesterday, after a 1.9 percent loss in June, according to
Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. The Eurozone Bond Index declined
1.6 percent last month.  Spain’s 10-year yield fell two basis points to 4.66 percent
after the rate increased six basis points yesterday.  Germany ’s  10-year yield  was at 1.67 percent after climbing
to 1.69 percent on July 25, the highest level since July 9.  Consumer Sentiment  An index of executive and consumer sentiment rose to 92.5
from 91.3 in June, the European Commission in Brussels said
today.  Unemployment (UMRTEMU)  in the region stayed at a record high in
June, according to the median of 36 forecasts in a Bloomberg
News  survey  before tomorrow’s release.  Spain and Italy’s borrowing costs will continue to converge
with Germany’s as the European Central Bank keeps interest rates
low, according to Paris-based Carmignac Gestion SA, which
oversees $73 billion.  “The ECB has intervened to separate the situation in
Europe from that in the United States as Europe cannot afford
tighter financial conditions,” the money manager founded by
Edouard Carmignac said in a third-quarter strategy document
dated yesterday and received today. “It seems reasonable to
assume that yields in southern European countries will resume
their convergence.”  The extra yield investors demand to hold Spanish 10-year
bonds over equivalent-maturity German bunds has narrowed to 2.99
percentage points from this year’s high of 4.12 percentage
points on Feb. 26. The Italian spread has dropped to 2.74
percentage points from a 2013 high of 3.61 percentage points on
March 28.  The ECB meets to review policy on Aug. 1. President Mario Draghi this month took what he called an “unprecedented” step
by telling investors interest rates would stay low as the
economy struggles to emerge from recession. The ECB’s benchmark
rate is at a record-low 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
