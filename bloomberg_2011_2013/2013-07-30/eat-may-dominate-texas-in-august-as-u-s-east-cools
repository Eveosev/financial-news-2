Heat will dominate Texas as August
begins while the eastern U.S. has seasonal or below-normal
temperatures, said  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather
Group LLC.  Temperatures may be 3 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit (1.7 to 2.8
Celsius) above normal across Texas from today until Aug. 8,
Rogers said. Warmer-than-normal conditions may also prevail
across the western U.S.  “The main hot spot concerns are Texas at times and in the
interior West to especially the Pacific Northwest,” Rogers,
who’s based in Bethesda,  Maryland , said in a note to clients.
“Dallas and Houston are both hotter today with more 100s in the
forecast. This week Dallas, next week, Dallas and Houston
both.”  Seasonal temperatures in the large cities of the eastern
U.S. and  Canada  may decrease energy consumption because fewer
people will turn to air conditioning to cool homes and offices.  Temperatures from the northern Great Plains to  New England ,
including Chicago and New York, are expected to range 3 to 5
degrees below normal from Aug. 4 to Aug. 8, Rogers said.  Seasonal temperatures may take hold along the East Coast
from Aug. 9 to 13 while the Midwest remains 3 to 5 degrees
cooler than normal, he said.  The normal average temperature in New York for Aug. 8 is
about 78 degrees, according to MDA Weather Services in
Gaithersburg, Maryland. In Boston it’s 74; Chicago, 74; Dallas,
87;  St. Louis , 80; and Seattle, 66.  To contact the reporter on this story:
