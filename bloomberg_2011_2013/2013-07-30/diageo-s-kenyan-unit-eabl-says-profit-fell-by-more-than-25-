East African Breweries Ltd.,  Diageo
Plc (DGE) ’s Kenyan unit, said profit for the year ended June fell more
than 25 percent as a result of higher financing charges and
because a one-time gain a year earlier wasn’t repeated.  EABL took a loan in November 2011 to buy a 20 percent stake
in Kenya Breweries Ltd. from  SABMiller Plc (SAB)  and sold a similiar
shareholding it held in Tanzania Breweries to SABMiller. EABL’s
net gain in the one-time transaction was 3.6 billion shillings
($41.2 million) for the year through June 2012, the company said
today in a statement e-mailed by the Nairobi Securities
Exchange.  “The EABL Board is confident that the company will return
to net earnings growth for the 2014 fiscal year,” it said.  In addition, the interest on that loan now covered a full
year of trading, compared with seven months for the prior fiscal
year, the company said. Net sales probably climbed in fiscal
2012-13 from a year earlier, EABL said. The full results will be
released Aug. 23.  First-half profit through December dropped 18 percent to
3.76 billion shillings as financing costs more than tripled, the
company reported in February.  EABL,  Kenya ’s second-biggest company by market value,
gained 0.9 percent to 349 shillings by the 3 p.m. close of the
stock exchange. The company issued its profit warning after the
market closed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
