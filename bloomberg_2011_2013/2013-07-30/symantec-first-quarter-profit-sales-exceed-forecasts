Symantec Corp. (SYMC) , the biggest maker of
security software, reported fiscal first-quarter profit that
exceeded analysts’ estimates as the company reduced costs to
cope with a record slump in personal-computer sales.  Profit before certain items in the period that ended June
28 was 44 cents a share, while sales rose 2.5 percent to $1.71
billion, the company said yesterday in a statement. Analysts on
average had projected profit of 36 cents and sales of $1.64
billion, according to  data compiled  by Bloomberg. The shares
surged to the highest price since 2005.  Chief Executive Officer Steve Bennett has cut jobs and
consolidated sales functions as shrinking PC shipments drag down
demand for Symantec’s antivirus software. His efforts to lower
expenses, along with a push to sell more server-management
programs to corporations, have helped cushion the blow, and the
company reiterated an earlier forecast for annual revenue.  “You have to give them an A-plus in light of what they’ve
done in this PC environment,” said  Daniel Ives , an analyst at
FBR Capital Markets & Co., who has the equivalent of a neutral
rating on the stock.  Symantec shares climbed 9 percent to $26.55 at 9:44 a.m. in
 New York , and earlier touched $26.58 for the highest intraday
price since January 2005. Through yesterday, the stock had
gained 85 percent since Bennett was appointed as CEO in July
2012 after Symantec’s board ousted  Enrique Salem .  Profit Forecast  Net income in the first quarter was little changed at $157
million, or 22 cents a share, compared with $160 million, or 22
cents, a year earlier,  Mountain View , California-based Symantec
said. Revenue in last year’s fiscal first quarter was $1.67
billion.  Sales in the company’s  division  that includes Norton
antivirus products fell less than 1 percent to $732 million, or
43 percent of total revenue. Sales in the unit that includes
data backup rose 4 percent to $641 million, contributing 38
percent of Symantec’s sales. The company’s corporate-security
technology business saw sales growth of 7 percent to $336
million, or 20 percent of the total.  Most of Symantec’s revenue now comes from businesses,
helping counter weakness in consumer demand for PCs and related
software, Bennett said in a telephone interview.  “The team continues to execute very, very well,” he said.  Profit in the second quarter, which ends in September, will
be 42 cents to 44 cents a share, Symantec said in the statement.
Revenue will be $1.65 billion to $1.69 billion. That compares
with average analysts’  predictions  of 45 cents in profit on
$1.71 billion in sales.  Annual Sales  For fiscal 2014, which ends in March, Symantec said sales
are still forecast to be unchanged to up 2 percent from the
prior year, indicating revenue of $6.91 billion to $7.04
billion. Analysts had estimated sales of $6.97 billion.  Worldwide PC shipments have dropped for five consecutive
quarters, the longest streak on record, as consumers
increasingly turn to tablets and smartphones for getting online,
Gartner Inc. said earlier this month.  In January, a person familiar with Symantec’s plans said
Bennett planned to eliminate 1,000 jobs, or about 5 percent of
the staff, in an effort to bolster profit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
