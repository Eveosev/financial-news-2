The  Houston Rockets  signed 39-year-old center Marcus Camby as a backup for  Dwight Howard , two weeks
after Camby was waived by the Toronto Raptors.  A 17-year National Basketball Association veteran, Camby
spent last season with the New York Knicks -- scoring 42 points
in 24 games -- and was traded to the Raptors this month in a
deal that brought Andrea Bargnani to New York.  The 6-foot-11 Camby becomes the Rocketsâ€™ third center,
joining Howard, a seven-time All-Star who signed with Houston as
a free agent, and 7-footer Omer Asik, who started all 82 games
for the team last season.  Camby, who appeared in 19 games for Houston during the
2011-12 season, has averaged 9.5 points and 9.8 rebounds for his
career with the Knicks, Rockets, Portland Trail Blazers,  Los
Angeles Clippers , Denver Nuggets and Toronto Raptors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
