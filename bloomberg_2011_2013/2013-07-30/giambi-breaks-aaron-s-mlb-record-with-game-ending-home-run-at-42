Jason Giambi  surpassed  Hank Aaron  as
the oldest player in Major League Baseball history to hit a
game-ending home run as he lifted the Cleveland Indians to a 3-2
win over the Chicago White Sox.  The 42-year-old Giambi, in his 19th major-league season,
led off the bottom of the ninth inning with a pinch-hit homer
last night to give the Indians their fifth consecutive victory.
Giambi was 45 days older than Aaron when he hit a game-winning
homer in 1976, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.  “This is what keeps me coming back every single year,”
Giambi said in a televised interview.  Giambi threw off his helmet as he rounded third base and
was met at home plate by his teammates, who later celebrated by
dumping a bucket of water on Giambi’s head.  It was the ninth career game-ending homer for Giambi, the
2000 American League Most Valuable Player who’s in his first
season with the Indians. Giambi’s 436 homers rank fourth among
active major leaguers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
