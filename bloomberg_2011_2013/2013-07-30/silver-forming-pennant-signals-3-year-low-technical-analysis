Silver, the worst performing
commodity this year, may drop a further 12 percent to a new
three-year low as it forms a triangular pattern called a bearish
pennant, said Barclays Plc.  Spot silver has moved into a narrowing price band since
June 28, when it touched $18.2305 an ounce, the lowest level
since August 2010. A close below $19.25 may prompt more selling
and pull the metal within a few weeks to as low as $17.50, a
level last traded in July 2010, said Dhiren Sarin, chief
technical strategist for Asia Pacific in  Singapore .  “We see it potentially forming a bearish pennant,” said
Sarin in a phone interview today. “We are moderately bearish at
the moment though we are watching these levels.”  The metal, which tumbled into a  bear market  in April along
with gold, lost 35 percent this year to become the worst
performer among the 24 raw materials tracked by the Standard &
Poor’s GSCI Spot Index. Silver for immediate delivery traded at
$19.832 an ounce at 12:04 p.m. in Singapore.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
