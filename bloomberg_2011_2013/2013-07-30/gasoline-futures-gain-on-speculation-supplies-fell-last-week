Gasoline futures advanced on
speculation that stockpiles of the motor fuel fell last week.  Prices rose as much as 0.7 percent. The Energy Information
Administration will probably report tomorrow that gasoline
stockpiles declined 1.3 million barrels in the week ended July
26, according to the median estimate of 10 analysts in a survey
by Bloomberg. Crack spreads widened.  “We still have five weeks of driving season left and
gasoline continues to find support above $3,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut .  Gasoline for August delivery rose 1.09 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $3.0234 a gallon at 9:43 a.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange. Trading volume was 56 percent below the
100-day average.  Gasoline’s  crack spread  versus WTI gained $1.14 to $21.67 a
barrel. The fuel’s  premium  to Brent rose 51 cents to $18.14.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell an eighth
consecutive day, dropping 0.7 cent to $3.624 a gallon, Heathrow,
Florida-based AAA said today on its website. That’s the lowest
level since July 14. Prices are 13.8 cents higher than a year
ago.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for August delivery fell 0.32 cent
to $3.013 on trading volume that was 52 percent below the 100-day average.  Distillate inventories, including diesel and heating oil,
increased 600,000 barrels last week, according to the survey.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate crude
widened 66 cents to $22.91 a barrel. The  premium over Brent  rose
3 cents to $19.38.  To contact the reporter on this story:
