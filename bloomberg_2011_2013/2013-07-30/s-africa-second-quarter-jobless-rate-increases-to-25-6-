South Africa ’s unemployment rate
rose last quarter to 25.6 percent, the highest of 45 emerging-market nations tracked by Bloomberg, as agriculture and
 manufacturing (SFPMNSAY)  industries shed jobs.  The  jobless  rate increased from 25.2 percent in the
previous three months,  Statistics South Africa  said in a report
released today in  Pretoria . The number of people without jobs
rose by 122,000 to 4.7 million. The  median estimate  in a
Bloomberg survey of six economists was for the unemployment rate
to reach 25.4 percent.  Africa’s biggest economy is set to expand this year at its
slowest pace since a 2009 recession, according to forecasts from
the central bank, as a recession in  Europe  saps demand for
manufactured exports and mining strikes curb output. Joblessness
and rising prices are undermining  consumer spending , which
accounts for more than 60 percent of expenditure in the economy.  “One would have expected that if exports increased, jobs
could have increased,” Pali Lehohla, the statistician-general,
told reporters in Pretoria.  Manufacturing, which makes up about 15 percent of the
economy, shed 18,000 jobs last quarter, while employment in
agriculture dropped by 26,000, the statistics office said. The
community and social services industry, which includes public
sector jobs, declined by 22,000.  Policy Dilemma  The  Reserve Bank  faces a monetary policy dilemma because
inflation is being stoked by a weaker rand while economic growth
is weakening, making it difficult for policy makers to cut the
benchmark  interest rate  from 5 percent, Governor Gill Marcus
said last week.  The central bank has reduced its economic growth forecast
for this year to 2 percent from 2.4 percent. That’s less than
half the rate of expansion the government says is necessary to
create 5 million jobs by 2020.  The rand fell 0.8 percent to 9.8672 against the dollar as
of 12:19 p.m. in Johannesburg, taking its decline this year to
14 percent.  Construction reported the biggest quarterly increase in
jobs, by 62,000, while employment in the trade industry climbed
by 52,000, the statistics office said. Mining added 9,000 jobs
and transport rose by 19,000.  Discouraged work-seekers, defined as those who are
unemployed and not actively looking for a job, aren’t included
in the calculation for the official  unemployment rate . These
work-seekers increased by 35,000 to 2.4 million in the quarter,
the statistics office said.  The unemployment rate is compiled from a household survey
covering the formal and informal industries.  To contact the reporters on this story:
