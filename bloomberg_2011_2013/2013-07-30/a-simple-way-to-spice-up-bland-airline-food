Unless you pack a  picnic , dining on an airplane isn't usually a treat. But I have an easy trick that helps make dull airline food a little more palatable. On long haul flights, I always pack one of those weekly plastic pill organizers—and fill them with my favorite selection of dry condiments.  • Truffle salt, which goes well with hard cheese or scrambled eggs.  • Crushed pink peppercorns, which I'll sprinkle sparingly on top of pink grapefruit, rice, or plain white fish filets.  • Sweet curry powder, to add heat to mayonnaise or salad dressings.  • Dried tarragon, to give a kick to otherwise-flavorless grilled chicken breasts.  • Powdered ginger, cocoa, and cinnamon, to stir into airline coffee with milk for an inflight spiced "latte" One last tip: To keep your purse from smelling like a spice souk, make sure you double-seal the pill box with plastic wrap. What would you pack in your own portable spice rack? More From  Condé Nast Traveler :
