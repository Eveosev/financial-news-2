Centrica Plc (CNA)  agreed to buy  Hess
Corp. (HES) ’s Energy Marketing business for $731 million in cash as
part of a plan to double profitability in  North America  within
five years.  The transaction by Direct Energy Business, Centrica’s North
American subsidiary, also includes net working capital of about
$300 million, the Windsor, England-based company said today in a
statement.  The company said in February its North American expansion
drive would be achieved through small and large purchases. It
teamed up with Qatar Petroleum to buy gas fields from Canada’s
Suncor Energy Inc. in April and also signed a 20-year contract
with Cheniere Energy Inc. to import the fuel from the U.S.  The deal “marks a significant step towards delivering on
our strategy - substantially increasing the scale of our North
American downstream business and integrating along the gas value
chain,” Sam Laidlaw, Centrica’s chief executive officer, said
in the statement.  Hess’s Energy Marketing business supplied 378 billion cubic
feet of gas and 28 terawatt hours of electricity to more than
23,000 customers last year, according to the statement. The
acquisition will make Direct Energy the largest business gas
supplier on the east coast.  Centrica is scheduled to publish first-half results
tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
