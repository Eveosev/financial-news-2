A loophole in Argentina’s currency
controls is giving buyers of securities linked to economic
growth a chance to almost double their money within 18 months.  At a time when Argentina is implementing the harshest
foreign-exchange restrictions in a decade, a clause in central
bank rules lets foreign investors convert coupon payments on
peso-denominated warrants to dollars at the official exchange
rate. With that rate forecast to fall to 7 pesos per dollar by
the next payment in December 2014, holders who buy $1 of
warrants now will be entitled to receive a 13.5-peso payout --
or about $1.93, based on estimates by Jefferies LLC.  The 93 percent implied return based on the increasing
dollar value of the coupon payment alone compares with a 5.9
percent  decline  for Argentina’s dollar-denominated government
bonds this year and 5.7 percent drop for  local-currency 
sovereign notes in emerging markets, according to JPMorgan Chase
& Co. After official data showed that  economy  expanded 7 percent
and 7.8 percent in April and May, the nation is now on track to
grow 4.8 percent this year, surpassing the threshold needed to
trigger a warrant payout, according to Jefferies.  The peso warrants are attractive because “most people
don’t know about the ability to get the official exchange rate
so they trade a bit cheap,” said Ray Zucaro, who helps oversee
$350 million of emerging-market debt at SW Asset Management in
Newport Beach,  California .  ‘Huge Upside’  Argentina will pay 5.1 billion pesos on the peso warrants
and $2.9 billion on the dollar warrants next year, according to
a July 25 report by Buenos Aires research company Empiria
Consultores.  Jefferies’ estimate is based on a 20 percent annualized
rate of depreciation in the official exchange rate for the peso.
Investors would own securities that are eligible for payments
until they expire in 2035.  “There could be huge upside,”  Siobhan Morden , head of
Latin America fixed-income at Jefferies, said in a telephone
interview from New York. “You have to assess regulatory risk
that you will in fact be compensated at the official foreign-exchange rate, the risk of a maxi devaluation and forecast risk
for GDP growth.”  Morden said that while “there’s value” in peso warrants,
she prefers the euro-denominated securities because the payment
is vulnerable to less regulatory and currency risk.  Euro Warrants  Morden forecasts that by the end of next year, the dollar
warrants will return 45 percent and warrants denominated in
euros are poised to gain 60 percent.  SW Asset Management estimates a coupon payment of 12 pesos
and an exchange rate of 8 pesos per dollar by the end of 2014,
resulting in a 50 percent return for local-currency warrants.  Last year, foreign investors were able to exchange their
peso coupon payment at the official exchange rate, reaping a
return of 51 percent. Barclays Plc recommended the trade at the
time, saying the securities had “meaningful upside potential.”  According to the central bank’s latest summary of currency
controls, which is dated February and posted on its  website ,
non-residents can exchange payments on “revenue of government
bonds and loans issued in local currency” at the official
exchange rate and take the funds out of Argentina.  ‘Don’t Trust’  After her re-election in 2011, President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  banned most foreign-currency purchases, restricted
imports and forced companies to bring money held abroad back to
the country. Her measures reduced outflows of capital, which had
almost doubled to $21.5 billion in 2011, to $3.4 billion last
year.  Diego Ferro, co-chief investment officer at Greylock, which
oversees $500 million in emerging-market debt, including euro-denominated GDP warrants, said the rules governing the peso
warrants are susceptible to change as they were issued under
Argentine legislation.  “I don’t trust Argentine law,” Ferro said in an e-mailed
response to questions. “In fact, I don’t trust any law that’s
not New York or  London . So even if they’re cheaper, I prefer
foreign-legislation warrants.”  The extra yield investors demand to own Argentine bonds
instead of U.S. Treasuries rose eight basis poiints, or 0.08
percentage point, to 1,147 basis points at 9:08 a.m. in Buenos
Aires, according to JPMorgan’s EMBI Global Diversified index.
The  spread  is the biggest among 57  emerging markets .  Most Expensive  Argentina’s five-year credit default swaps, contracts that
protect holders of the debt against non-payment, are the most
expensive in the world, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
swaps rose 38 basis points to 2,487 basis point at 8 a.m. in New
York, according to data compiled by CMA Ltd.  Securities issued under Argentine law may be safer than
those governed by New York legislation, according to Zucaro.  The country is appealing a U.S. court order to pay $1.3
billion to owners of bonds on which it defaulted in 2001 at the
same time it makes payments on performing securities.
Fernandez’s promises not to pay the holdouts any more than it
paid bondholders in 2005 and 2010 restructurings have fueled
speculation she may opt to default on the New York-law debt.  Payments on the GDP warrants, which were issued as part of
the restructurings, are triggered when growth surpasses annual
targets set in the securities’ contract. No disbursement is due
this December, the month payments are made, after an expansion
of  2 percent  in 2012 fell short of the threshold.  Warrant Payment  Last December, the government made a $3.5 billion payment,
based on 2011 growth of 8.9 percent. Peso warrants have risen 39
percent since the Dec. 14 payment.  Even if the economy stagnates in the second half, growth in
the first semester was sufficient for GDP to expand 4.5 percent
this year, Empiria Consultores said in a report titled, “A
Statistic that Costs $3.6 Billion” -- a reference to the amount
the research company calculates the government will disburse in
December 2014.  To fall short of the 3.22 percent threshold, the economy
would have to contract 1.6 percent in the second half, which
would be the slowest expansion for the second six months of any
year since 2002, according to Hernan Lacunza, a former central
bank general manager who runs Empiria.  Legislative elections in October make such a contraction
unlikely as the government will want to present a thriving
economy to voters, Lacunza said.  “The peso warrants are attractive,” Lacunza said in a
telephone interview. “Everything is pointing to a warrant
payment next year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
