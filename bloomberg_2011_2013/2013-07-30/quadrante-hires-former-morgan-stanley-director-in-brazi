Quadrante Investimentos Ltda , a
Brazilian fund that manages about 1 billion reais ($440
million), hired Alvaro Marangoni to help expand its investments
outside Brazil.  Marangoni, who spent almost 10 years as head of sales at
 Morgan Stanley (MS)  in Latin America’s largest economy, joined Sao
Paulo-based Quadrante to focus on global assets, he said.  “Quadrante has been mainly focused on investing in stocks
and bonds issued by Brazilian companies or the government,” he
said today in a telephone interview from  Sao Paulo . “It’s time
for us to expand into global assets.”  Marangoni previously worked for Robert Fleming & Co., which
was bought by Chase Manhattan in 2000, and Banco Fator SA in
Brazil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
