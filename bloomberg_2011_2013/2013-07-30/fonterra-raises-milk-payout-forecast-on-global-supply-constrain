Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd., the
world’s largest dairy exporter, raised its forecast payment to
farmer suppliers, citing slowing production in  Europe  and  China 
and a weaker  New Zealand dollar .  Farmers will receive NZ$7.50 ($5.99) per kilogram of milk
solids in the year ending May 31, Auckland-based Fonterra said
in a statement. That compares with an initial May 29 estimate of
NZ$7 and last year’s distribution of NZ$5.80.  “At the beginning of this season our forecast was that
dairy commodity prices would continue at or near current levels
until the fourth quarter,” Chairman  John Wilson  said in the
statement. “Supply constraints in Europe and China during the
Northern Hemisphere spring have contributed to an increase in
dairy prices of 3 percent over the past two months.”  Payments to Fonterra’s 10,500 farmer suppliers will also be
boosted by the New Zealand dollar’s 6.7 percent slide in the
past three months, the company said. Rising farm incomes and
higher returns from exports will add to growth in New Zealand’s
NZ$211 billion economy.  “2013-14 is shaping up as a bumper dairy season,” Nathan
Penny, an economist at  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  in Auckland, said
in an e-mailed note. The lift in milk prices from last year
combined with a possible 5 percent rebound in production would
boost the economy by about NZ$3.4 billion, or 1.6 percent of
nominal GDP, he said.  Dividend Forecast  New Zealand ’s dollar was little changed after Fonterra’s
announcement. It bought 79.82 U.S. cents at 5:20 p.m. in
Wellington.  Fonterra also forecast it will pay a 2013-14 dividend of 32
cents a share, matching its projected 2012-13 distribution.  “During the first half we are likely to have to absorb
some of the expected substantial increases in the cost of goods
arising from current high commodity prices, and this could have
an impact on margins,” Chief Executive Officer Theo Spierings
said.  Shares of the Fonterra Shareholders’ Fund, which are backed
by the dividend flows and earnings of the cooperative, fell 2.5
percent to NZ$7.30 at the 5 p.m. market close in Wellington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
