Next Plc (NXT) , the U.K.’s second-largest
clothing retailer, narrowed its sales growth target for the full
year after first-half sales missed analysts’ estimates.  Sales may advance between 1.5 percent and 3.5 percent in
the full year if they reach the company’s second-half goal of
advancing between 1 percent and 4 percent, the Leicester,
England-based retailer said today. Total sales under the Next
brand, excluding value-added taxes, rose 2.3 percent in the 26
weeks ended July 27. The median estimate of 13 analysts was for
a 2.4 percent gain.  Sales are more volatile and difficult to predict as
consumers become more “spontaneous” with their shopping
decision, the company said. That’s led to more revenue from
selling full-priced items and fewer discounts, which boosted
earnings in the first half and will lead to profit being as much
as 675 million pounds ($1.04 billion), higher than an earlier
target of as much as 665 million pounds, Next said.  In May, the company predicted full-year revenue growth of 1
percent to 4 percent. Next shares rose 1.1 percent to 4,902
pence in London trading yesterday. The shares have climbed 32
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
