While finding a home these days can be very difficult in some markets, not every home is snagged immediately, leaving real estate agents with the responsibility of marketing their homes and exposing them to prospective buyers. Open houses allow for creativity and endless ideas, letting a real estate agent wear the second hat of “event planner” while putting together an affair that hopefully will keep people talking enough to get the home sold. When it comes to luxury real estate, the typical weekend afternoon drop-in simply won’t do. Open houses for these properties are well-orchestrated events designed to attract prospective buyers and leave a lasting impression. Attracting the right crowd Why go over the top for an open house? A lot of strategy is used when deciding which direction to go and how to position the home (and the open house) to gain the maximum exposure. Quantity and quality work hand in hand; attracting a large number of people is important, but just as important is attracting and inviting the  right  people — ones who are able to purchase the property! Luxury attracts luxury: Have an extravagant event, and the extravagant (and their checkbooks) will follow. Outside-the-box thinking intrigues people, generally causing a stir and receiving the wanted result and goal — gaining as much attention for the property as possible. By invitation only Art shows are widely used in open houses for luxury properties, bringing in clients who may solely attend just for the art — but end up leaving with a home to hang their purchases in. In this case, a private, invite-only open house may be appropriate, creating an intimate and “homey” insight on the property. Charity events and corporate-sponsored parties are other over-the-top ways to host a newsworthy open house by combining a guest list of wealthy attendees with a showcase of the home’s entertainment potential. Incorporating a theme Ever think of a  Studio 54-themed open house ? From blinking LED lights to dancers, a DJ and a fog machine, an agent actually transformed a million-dollar home into a nightclub, allowing guests and agents to see all of the capabilities and details of the home — including its bachelor pad-esque features. While luxury listing agents generally spend tens of thousands of dollars on marketing, that doesn’t mean their events have an over-the-top budget. Outside-the-box thinking matched with added efforts will make any open house an affair to remember and create a buzz about the listing.
