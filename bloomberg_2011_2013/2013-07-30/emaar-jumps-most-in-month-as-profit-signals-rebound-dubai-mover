Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR)  jumped the
most in a month after the Middle East’s second-biggest developer
by market value followed  Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES)  in posting profit
that beat estimates, boosting confidence in Dubai’s recovery.  Emaar, developer of the world’s tallest tower, gained 2.8
percent to 5.90 dirhams at the close Dubai as volume jumped to
23 million shares, 43 percent above the three-month daily
average. Emirates NBD rallied 4.7 percent, taking its increase
to 11 percent since the largest bank in the United Arab Emirates
reported earnings on July 22. The benchmark  DFM General Index (DFMGI) 
rose 2 percent, bringing the 2013 gain to 58 percent, the most
after  Ghana ’s index among 93 benchmarks tracked by Bloomberg.  “Investors seem to have some level of certainty about
Dubai’s improving economy and fundamentals,” Amer Khan, a
Dubai-based director at Shuaa Asset Management, said by e-mail
today. “No other stocks were perhaps a better gauge of that
uncertainty discount than Emaar and Emirates NBD.”  Emaar yesterday said  second-quarter net income  was 675
million dirhams ($184 million), surpassing the 529 million-dirham average estimate of six analysts. The company, which
operates Dubai Mall, the world’s largest by area, said shopping
centres and hospitality contributed 45 percent to first-half
revenue as visitors to the mall surged 23 percent to 38 million.  Justified Rally  Property sales in Dubai also jumped to 6.3 billion dirhams
in the first half from 1.6 billion in the year-earlier period,
the company said. The sheikhdom, one of seven that make up the
U.A.E., suffered one of the world’s worst real estate crashes
after the 2008 global credit crisis.  Emirates NBD, which faced an increase in bad loans during
the crash, said July 22 its second-quarter profit surged 50
percent as the non-performing loans ratio fell to 13.9 percent
in June from 14.3 percent in December. The lender’s shares trade
at  10.2 times  estimated earnings after soaring 87 percent this
year, compared with  12.1 times  for the Bloomberg GCC 200
Financial Index.  “You’ve had solid earnings justifying the rally,” Khan
said. “With expectations of further improvement and valuations
still below book, its very possible that there is further
upside.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
