A fourth executive of the
Connecticut-based unit of French power company  Alstom SA (ALO)  was
accused of bribing Indonesian officials to win contracts.  Lawrence Hoskins, 62, was charged by the U.S. Justice
Department in an indictment filed today in New Haven,
 Connecticut , with money-laundering and conspiring to violate the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  Charged along with Hoskins, a former senior vice president
for the Asian region for the company, was William Pomponi, a
former vice president of sales, who was named in an earlier
indictment. The U.S. has declined to name the company. A
spokesman for Levallois-Perret, France-based Alstom confirmed
reports about the indictments in April.  The U.S. said the defendants paid bribes to a member of the
Indonesian Parliament and officials of a state-owned electricity
company to secure a $118 million contract to provide power to
residents.  Two other executives, Frederic Pierucci and David
Rothschild, have pleaded guilty in connection with the case.  The case is U.S. v. Hoskins, 12-cr-00238, U.S. District
Court, District of Connecticut (New Haven).  To contact the reporter on this story:
