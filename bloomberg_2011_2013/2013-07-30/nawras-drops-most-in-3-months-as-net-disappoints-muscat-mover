Omani Qatari Telecommunications Co.
SAOG dropped the most in three months after the company known as
Nawras posted second-quarter profit that fell 22 percent,
missing estimates.  Shares of the Muscat-based company retreated 3.9 percent,
the most since April 29, to 0.5 rial at the close in the Omani
capital. The stock was the biggest decliner on the benchmark
MSM30  Index (MSM30) , which dropped 0.6 percent.  The company’s net income fell to 7.5 million rials ($19.5
million) from 9.7 million rials in the year-earlier period, the
company said in a statement yesterday. The shares have gained
8.5 percent this year and trade at 7.9 times estimated earnings,
compared with 14.8 times for the Bloomberg GCC 200
Communications Index.  “Quarterly profit is not inspiring although the company
showed a steady growth of its top line,” said Tariq Qaqish,
head of asset management at Dubai-based Al Mal Capital PSC. “It
seems that competition is getting fierce. The stock still trades
at attractive multiples and the company fundamentals remain
intact.”  Oil-rich Oman, with a population of 3 million, has the
second-smallest economy among the six-nation Gulf Cooperation
Council, which also includes Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates. Oman’s economic growth is expected to slow to 3.9
percent in 2014, compared with 4.5 percent this year, according
to the median estimate of 14 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
