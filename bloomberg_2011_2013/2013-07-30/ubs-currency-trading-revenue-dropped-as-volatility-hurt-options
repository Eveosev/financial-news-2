UBS AG (UBSN) , the fourth-largest currency
trader, said revenue from its foreign exchange business fell in
the second quarter due to increased price swings in the market.  “Foreign-exchange revenues declined as options revenues
decreased due to higher volatility levels and reduced
liquidity,” the Zurich-based bank said in a statement today.
The drop was partially offset by an increase in revenue from
spot currency trading, particularly due to greater electronic
transaction volumes, it said.  Revenue from currencies, rates and credit declined 42
percent to 362 million Swiss franc ($389 million), from 619
million in the first three months of this year, UBS said.  “The second quarter was characterized by challenging
market conditions which led to increased volatility and a market
selloff,” UBS said. “Rates and credit were impacted by the
more challenging trading environment in the latter part of the
quarter.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
