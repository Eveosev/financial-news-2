Stocks in Switzerland were little
changed, with the benchmark Swiss Market Index heading for a
monthly gain, as  UBS AG (UBSN)  advanced after posting an increase in
second-quarter profit.  UBS rose 2.1 percent after also saying it has surpassed its
year-end target for reducing risk-weighted assets.  Clariant AG (CLN) 
added 1.2 percent after quarterly earnings beat estimates.
 Bucher Industries AG (BUCN)  climbed the most in three weeks after
reporting higher first-half profit.  Novartis AG (NOVN) , which accounts
for 19 percent of  the SMI (SMI) , declined.  The SMI lost 0.1 percent to 7,803.97 at 9:45 a.m. in
Zurich. The equity benchmark is heading for a 1.6 percent gain
in July as the U.S. central bank said it remains flexible on the
pace of asset purchases. The SMI halted nine straight months of
gains in June. The broader Swiss Performance Index slipped less
than 0.1 percent today.  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies
was 3.5 percent higher than the average of the past 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The European Central Bank and the Bank of England announce
policy decisions on Thursday, while the Federal Reserve
concludes its two-day meeting tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
