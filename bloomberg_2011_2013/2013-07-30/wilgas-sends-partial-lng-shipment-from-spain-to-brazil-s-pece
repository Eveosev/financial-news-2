The Wilgas is sailing to a Petroleo
Brasileiro SA floating regasification terminal in northeastern
 Brazil  to deliver a partial cargo of liquefied natural gas,
shipping data show.  The vessel, with a capacity of about 127,000 cubic meters,
is scheduled to arrive at Pecem port on Aug. 2, according to
ship transmissions captured by IHS Fairplay on Bloomberg. It
discharged some of its cargo July 28 at Guanabara Bay, where
state-owned Petrobras also operates a floating terminal.  The Wilgas loaded the supercooled natural gas at the Huelva
LNG terminal in southwestern  Spain , data on the website of
network operator  Enagas SA (ENG)  show.  Brazil doesn’t have long-term LNG supply contracts with
Spain, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Rio de Janeiro-based Petrobras will import as many as 60 cargoes this year, up
from 56 in 2012, the company said June 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
