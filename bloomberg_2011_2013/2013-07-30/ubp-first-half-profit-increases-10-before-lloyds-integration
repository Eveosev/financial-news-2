Union Bancaire Privee said first-half profit climbed 10 percent as the Geneva-based wealth
manager founded by Edgar de Picciotto boosted fee income and
reduced costs.  Profit rose to 77.2 million Swiss francs ($83 million) from
70 million francs a year earlier, the closely held bank said in
an e-mailed statement today. Client assets under management
advanced to 81.1 billion francs at the end of June, from 80
billion francs six months earlier.  “Boosted by a rebound on the markets and its renewed
product sales drive, UBP was able to strengthen its positioning
with both private and institutional clients, not only in
 Switzerland , but also in  emerging markets ,” the firm said in
the  statement .  UBP, once the world’s largest investor in  hedge funds , is
rebuilding through acquisitions after assets slumped 55 percent
in the four years through June 2011. The firm agreed in May to
buy  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) ’s international private banking
units in Geneva, Zurich,  Monaco , Gibraltar and Montevideo for as
much as 100 million pounds ($153 million) in cash.  It will integrate 7.2 billion pounds of client assets from
Lloyds when the deal closes at the end of October, UBP said.  UBP posted an 11 percent gain to 233.4 million francs of
income from fees and commissions. Operating expenses fell 11
percent, lowering the firm’s cost-to-income ratio to 66 percent
at the end of June from 76 percent a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
