Former Malian Prime Minister Ibrahim Boubacar Keita has a “significant” lead over his rivals with a
third of the ballots counted from the July 28 presidential
election, a government minister said.  If that gap is confirmed, there would be no need for a run-off vote, Moussa Sinko Coulibaly, minister of territorial
administration, told reporters in the capital, Bamako yesterday.
Coulibaly has until Aug. 2 to send the preliminary results to
the constitutional court, which will publish them.  Mali’s first presidential election since an army coup and a
French military offensive against rebels in the north won praise
from foreign monitors including the European Union and the
 International Republican Institute . Donors deemed the vote
necessary before they can resume aid to the West African nation,
the continent’s third-biggest gold producer.  Keita, 68, leads Soumaila Cisse, a 63-year-old former
commission chairman of the West African Monetary Union, and
Dramane Dembele, Coulibaly said.  The 27-candidate race took place following more than a year
of strife after an ethnic-Touareg uprising in the north prompted
a group of soldiers to overthrow the government. French and
African forces intervened to restore order after the Touaregs
joined Islamist militants in an offensive that almost split the
nation in half.  To contact the reporter on this story:
