Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VNDA)  gained
the most in four years after U.S. regulators said they would
give a priority review to the company’s treatment for sleep
disorders.  The  Food and Drug Administration  will expedite the
application process for tasimelteon, which treats blind people
with Non-24-Hour Disorder, a condition of the body’s circadian
rhythm, the Rockville, Maryland-based company said yesterday in
a statement. If approved, the drug would become Vanda’s second
product, joining Fanapt, a schizophrenia drug marketed in the
U.S. by Novartis AG.  Vanda’s shares jumped 42 percent to $11.42 at 2:23 p.m. New
York time, after earlier reaching $11.53 for the biggest
intraday gain since May 2009. The stock had more than  doubled 
this year through yesterday.  There is no approved treatment for Non-24-Hour Disorder,
which occurs when the blind are unable to synchronize their
internal body clock with the 24-hour daily cycle, Vanda said in
the statement.  The FDA scheduled an advisory panel meeting for Nov. 14 on
tasimelteon, which seeks to reset the body’s internal clock and
align it with the day-night cycle. The agency plans to decide on
the drug’s approval by Jan. 31, the company said.  Vanda, which has reported annual net losses the past two
years, will announce  quarterly earnings  tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
