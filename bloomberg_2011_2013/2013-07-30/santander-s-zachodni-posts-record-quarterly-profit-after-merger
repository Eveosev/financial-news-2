Bank Zachodni WBK SA,  Poland ’s
third-largest lender and a unit of  Banco Santander SA (SAN) , posted a
record quarterly profit on higher loan revenue.  Net income  rose 10 percent to 419.5 million zloty ($132
million) in April-June from a year earlier, the bank said in a
regulatory statement today. That beat the 355.3 million-zloty
mean  estimate  of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Second-quarter net interest income, the difference between
what the bank pays on deposits and what it charges for loans,
soared 39 percent to 797.6 million zloty from 571.8 million
zloty a year earlier after the lender adjusted its pricing on
deposits to offset falling interest rates in Poland this year.
Fee income rose 31 percent to 445.6 million zloty.  Zachodni  shares  jumped 2.9 percent to 313 zloty at 10:08
a.m. in Warsaw, heading for the highest close in six years.  The bank, which completed a merger with Santander’s Warsaw-based unit Kredyt Bank SA this year, expects its 2013 profit to
exceed 1.43 billion zloty posted in 2012, Chief Executive
Officer Mateusz Morawiecki said in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
