Royal Bank of Canada  sold A$1.25
billion ($1.13 billion) of three-year floating-rate notes in the
lender’s debut covered bond offering in Australia.  Canada ’s largest bank by assets priced the South Pacific
nation’s first covered debt transaction for 2013 to yield 53
basis points more than the bank bill swap rate, according to an
e-mailed statement from the issuer.  Covered bonds, which are backed by the borrower and
mortgages that stay on its balance sheet, were last sold in
Australia by Suncorp-Metway Ltd. in November, when the Brisbane-based lender priced A$600 million of five-year securities, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Since then, home-loan providers have
opted to raise wholesale funds through unsecuritized notes and
the revived market for residential mortgage-backed debt.  Bookrunners and joint lead managers for RBC’s transaction
were the bank itself,  Australia  & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.
and National Australia Bank Ltd. Westpac Banking Corp. was also
a joint lead manager. Covered notes, a form of issuance that was
pioneered in 18th century Prussia, typically carry top credit
ratings and tend to be issued at narrower spreads than debt that
is not backed by collateral.  To contact the reporter on this story:
