Mosaic Co., the second-largest North
American potash producer, said U.S. imports may increase after
Russia’s OAO Uralkali quit a trading venture with Belarus, one
of two marketing ventures that control most of the global
market.  Mosaic doesn’t plan any specific actions following
Uralkali’s move, which was announced earlier today. Plymouth,
Minnesota-based Mosaic will continue to balance supply with
demand, Chief Financial Officer Larry Stranghoener said in a
telephone interview. Mosaic didn’t see Uralklai’s decision
coming, he said.  Mosaic is part of Canpotex, a group of North American
producers that coordinate export sales. Canpotex provides
“great value” to North American producers, Stranghoener said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
