Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  sold $853 million
worth of Surface tablets in its latest fiscal year, as the maker
of Windows software struggles to capitalize on a shift by
consumers toward handheld devices.  Microsoft disclosed Surface sales, which weren’t specified
in the company’s latest earnings report, in a regulatory filing
today.  Earnings in the period that ended in June were hit by a
$900 million writedown of inventory related to Surface, a mobile
touch-screen computer introduced by Microsoft in October to
compete with  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad and tablets running  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s
Android operating system.  Windows sales have been besieged by poor demand for PCs,
reflected in five consecutive quarters of declining shipments,
according to researcher IDC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
