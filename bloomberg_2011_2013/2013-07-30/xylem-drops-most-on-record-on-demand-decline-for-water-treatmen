Xylem Inc. plunged the most on
record after the water company spun off by  ITT Corp. (ITT)  revised
down full-year revenue forecasts citing weaker demand.  The  shares  fell as much as 17 percent, the most since it
started trading in New York in 2011, after Xylem cut 2013
revenue forecasts to $3.7 billion, 5 percent lower than it
predicted on March 7. Xylem cited a slump in U.S. industrial
production, the credit crisis in Europe and lower shipments of
treatment project.  The New York-based company reported second-quarter revenue
of $960 million, down 3.4 percent from the same period a year
ago, according to a statement issued today.  “While our second-quarter results were lower than
expected, we captured important contract wins in June, resulting
in record orders of more than $1 billion in the quarter,” said
Gretchen McClain, president and chief executive officer of
Xylem.  The company won contracts in  China ,  Spain  and the United
Arab Emirates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
