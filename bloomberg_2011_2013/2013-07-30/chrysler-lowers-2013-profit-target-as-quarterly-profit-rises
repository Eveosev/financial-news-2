Chrysler Group LLC lowered its
target for full-year earnings, even after second-quarter profit
climbed 16 percent on higher demand for the Jeep Grand Cherokee
and Ram pickups.  Net income rose to $507 million from $436 million a year
earlier, the  Auburn Hills , Michigan-based automaker said in a
statement today. Sales advanced 7.1 percent to $18 billion.  Fiat
SpA (F) , Chrysler’s majority owner, separately today reported
second-quarter profit that was better than analysts expected on
reduced European spending and the increased Ram sales.  Sergio Marchionne , chief executive officer of both
companies, is relying on Chrysler and its 39 consecutive monthly
U.S. sales gains, to offset losses at Fiat’s mass-market brands
in  Europe . Automakers may sell 15.4 million cars and light
trucks in the U.S. this year, the average of 18 analyst
estimates and the most since 2007, as the economy follows the
auto industry’s rebound.  “The timing of product launches and capacity increases
causes this year’s performance to be biased to the second
half,” Marchionne said in the statement. “A continued
aggressive drive for excellence and flawless execution will be
essential to attain the targets we’ve set for ourselves.”  Chrysler forecast operating profit of $3.3 billion to $3.8
billion, compared with a previous target of about $3.8 billion.
Operating profit was $2.9 billion last year. The company
predicted deliveries of about 2.6 million vehicles, compared
with a range of 2.6 million to 2.7 million.  Fiat’s Results  Fiat’s trading profit, or earnings before interest, taxes
and one-time items, increased 8.7 percent to 1.03 billion euros
($1.37 billion) from 947 million euros a year earlier, compared
with 931 million euros, the average of four analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 3.7 percent to 22.3 billion
euros.  Chrysler’s deliveries in its home market gained 8.9 percent
in the first half of the year to 908,332 cars and light trucks,
helped by a 23 percent gain for Ram, 7.6 percent for Grand
Cherokee and deliveries for the new Dodge Dart.  Marchionne wants to buy the 41.5 percent of Chrysler Fiat
doesn’t own and forge a global manufacturer able to challenge
 General Motors Co. (GM)  and  Volkswagen AG. (VOW)  Turin, Italy-based Fiat
rescued Chrysler through a government-brokered alliance in 2009.
Marchionne obtained control of Chrysler without paying cash by
pledging Fiat’s vehicles, technology and managerial expertise.  Since then, Chrysler has emerged as the financial power of
the Fiat-Chrysler alliance. Without Chrysler, Fiat would have
reported a loss for 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
