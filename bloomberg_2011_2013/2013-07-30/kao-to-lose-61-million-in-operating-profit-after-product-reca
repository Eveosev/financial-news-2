Kao Corp. (4452) , Japan’s biggest maker of
toiletries, said it would lose 6 billion yen ($61 million) of
operating profit this fiscal year after it recalled whitening
products that caused skin blotches to more than 2,000 customers.  “The sale of our whitening products will fall in the
second half. Our reputation was hurt,” Kao President Michitaka Sawada said at a press conference yesterday. The company expects
to lose 10 billion yen in sales this fiscal year, he said.  Kao is still assessing how much damage it will face from
the  product recall  that caused “depigmentation” to more than
2,000 people in Japan. The company plans to compensate customers
and it hasn’t decided on the amount, said Sawada who apologized
yesterday to the affected people.  The whitening products by Kao’s Kanebo Cosmetics unit were
recalled starting this month. They were sold in 10 countries and
areas outside of  Japan , Shinji Yamada, a spokesman for Kanebo,
said yesterday. About 100 people in  Taiwan  reported the skin
blotches after using the products, he said.  The Tokyo-based company said on July 29 it lowered its net
income forecast by 8.2 percent to 67 billion yen because of the
special loss of 5.6 billion yen resulting from the recall it
posted in the first half.  To contact the reporter on this story:
