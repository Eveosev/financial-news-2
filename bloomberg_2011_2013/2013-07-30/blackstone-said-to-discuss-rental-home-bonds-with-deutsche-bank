Blackstone Group LP (BX) , the private-equity firm that spent $5 billion buying more than 30,000 houses
to rent them out, is working with  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  as it
considers creating securities tied to about 1,500 of such
properties, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  The bonds, which Deutsche Bank may begin marketing to
investors as soon as next month, could have about $250 million
in balances and be backed by $300 million to $350 million in
collateral, said the person, who asked not to be named because
the discussions are private. The Wall Street Journal reported
details of the talks earlier today on its website.  Christine Anderson , a spokeswoman for New York-based
Blackstone, declined to comment, as did  Renee Calabro , a
spokeswoman in New York for Deutsche Bank.  Blackstone has led private-equity firms including Colony
Capital LLC and Apollo Global Management LLC that have emerged
as large-scale landlords as the housing market recovers from a
five-year slump. Blackstone has a $3.6 billion credit line from
lenders led by Deutsche Bank.  To contact the reporters on this story:
