Barclays Plc (BARC) , Britain’s second-biggest bank by assets, said it’s contesting a regulator’s
findings in a probe into fees the bank paid Qatar during a 2008
fundraising that helped it avoid a bailout.  The Financial Conduct Authority sent Barclays on June 27
its preliminary findings over the fees and the involvement of
four current and former employees including Finance Director
Chris Lucas, the London-based lender said in a statement today.  The FCA’s enforcement unit typically gives companies early
notification when it expects to levy fines or other penalties.
The regulator is probing if Barclays properly disclosed fees
paid to the Qatar Investment Authority as part of a 7 billion-pound ($10.7 billion) fundraising during the financial crisis, a
move that helped the lender avoid taking state aid unlike Lloyds
Banking Group Plc and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  “Barclays expects further developments in the near-term,”
it said in a statement. On a conference call with reporters
today, Barclays Chief Executive Officer  Antony Jenkins  declined
to answer any questions on Qatar, citing the investigation.  The bank today said it plans to raise 5.8 billion pounds in
a rights offering to bolster capital. It will also  shrink assets 
by as much as 80 billion pounds to 1.5 trillion pounds and sell
2 billion pounds of loss-absorbing securities to meet calls by
the regulator to cut  leverage .  Barclays was fined 290 million pounds last year for rigging
the London interbank offered rate, the benchmark  interest rate 
used by $300 trillion of contracts worldwide ranging from
mortgages to  student loans .  To contact the reporter on this story:
