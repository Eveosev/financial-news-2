Tecnicas Reunidas SA (TRE) , a Spanish
industrial engineering company, is set to win a $1 billion
contract to build a natural gas-processing plant in Algeria,
according to a document seen by Bloomberg News.  The company, based in Madrid, was chosen by a joint venture
between  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA of France and Algeria’s Sonatrach to design
and build the facility with a capacity to produce 13 million
cubic meters of the fuel a day, according to the document.
Tecnicas competed for the contract with London-based Petrofac
Ltd. and Japan’s  JGC Corp. (1963)   Algeria’s Touat field is estimated to hold 68.5 billion
cubic meters of natural gas and 8.5 million barrels of
condensate, the document showed. Spokesman for GDF Suez and
Sonatrach weren’t available for comment when contacted by
 Bloomberg News  today.  Tecnicas reported today first-half net income of 66.9
million euros ($88.7 million), missing the 70.6 million euros
projected by the average of seven analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Net revenue in the period climbed to 1.4 billion
euros from 1.3 billion euros a year earlier.  The  shares  dropped 5.1 percent, the most since February,
trading 34.98 euros, at 2:32 p.m. in Madrid, valuing the company
at 2 billion euros. They were the worst performer of 35 stocks
on the benchmark IBEX 35 index.  Tecnicas said today its first-half order backlog reached a
record as it climbed 13 percent from a year earlier to 7 billion
euros. The engineering company also plans to continue
diversifying, it said in a separate presentation today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
