One of the most common complaints senior executives have about disruptive innovation is its seemingly snail-like pace. How is it, they wonder, that it takes us forever to pursue ideas that promise to create new markets when the world seems to be innovating at a dizzying pace? This frustration is compounded by the fact that the usual levers senior executives use to get things to go faster — creating tight deadlines, flooding the project with resources, checking in more frequently — don't seem to work, and in many cases cause teams working on disruptive ideas to actually go slower.  Why is that? Tight deadlines, frequent check-ins, and additional resources indeed help to accelerate execution of a strategic plan. But succeeding with disruption first requires developing a strategic plan that can be executed. As innovation thought leader Steve Blank notes, a startup is a temporary organization searching for a scalable business model. Accelerating the search for a strategy is a very different challange than executing that strategy. There are five ways to accelerate the search for a viable new-growth model: Here is one litmus test to gauge the degree to which you are following the approach I've just described. Ask the team the ratio of time spent preparing materials for management (or conducting desk research to feed into materials for management) versus time spent with customers, developing products, or talking to potential partners. If the ratio is higher than 1:3, you have a problem.  These five pointers won't guarantee success.  But following them will enable a team to discover as quickly as possible if there appears to be a viable path forward. If there is, then all the disciplines companies use to scale businesses typically prove helpful (unless the model that emerges has stark differences with the core business — but that's a different post). If there isn't, then at least the company learned that quickly and can move on to the next idea.
