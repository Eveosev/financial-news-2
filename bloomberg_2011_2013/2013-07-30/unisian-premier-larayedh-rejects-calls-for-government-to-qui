Tunisian Prime Minister Ali Larayedh
rejected calls for his Islamist-led coalition to step down
following violent street protests sparked by the killing of a
second opposition leader this year.  “We aren’t clinging to power, but we have a duty and a
responsibility that we will exercise to the end,” Larayedh said
yesterday in comments broadcast on state television. A new
constitution will be drafted by August, and general elections
held on Dec. 17, he said.  Security forces yesterday erected barbed wire around the
main square in front of the National Constituent Assembly in the
capital, Tunis, to prevent clashes between opposition protesters
and government supporters.  The government announced last week that Mohamed Brahmi,
shot dead on July 25, and Chukri Beleid, assassinated six months
earlier, were killed with the same weapon by a member of the
Salafi movement that seeks to impose Islamic law. That fueled
anger among the opposition groups that say the government has
failed to control hardline Islamists looking to move Tunisia
away from its secular traditions.  The secular Ettakatol party is among groups demanding the
coalition led by the moderate Islamist Ennahda party step down.  The killing of Beleid led to the downfall of Prime Minister
Hamadi Jebali, undermining the transition to democracy in the
birthplace of the 2011 Arab Spring.  To contact the reporter on this story:
