Apple Inc. (AAPL)  was sued by two former
employees at its retail stores who claim they weren’t paid for
time they spent waiting to have their bags searched each time
they went for lunch or left at the end of the day.  The two former employees, one who worked in a Los Angeles
store and one who most recently worked at a  New York  location,
seek to represent other hourly workers at Apple’s stores in a
class-action lawsuit, according to their complaint filed July 25
in federal court in San Francisco.  They seek to represent retail workers in  California  who
over the past four years weren’t paid for time waiting in
security screening lines, as well as workers in the state of New
York who weren’t paid for that time during the past six years,
according to the complaint.  They lost as much as $1,500 in wages a year because of the
screenings, which sometimes took 10 to 15 minutes, according to
the complaint.  Steve Dowling, a spokesman for Cupertino, California-based
Apple, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail today seeking
comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Frlekin v. Apple Inc., 13-03451, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California ( San Francisco .)  To contact the reporter on this story:
