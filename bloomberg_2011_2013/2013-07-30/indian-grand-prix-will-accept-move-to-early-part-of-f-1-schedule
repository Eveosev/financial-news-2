The promoter of the Indian Grand
Prix said it will accept a move to the early part of the Formula
One schedule from autumn.  Formula One Chief Executive Officer  Bernie Ecclestone  told
the Indo-Asian News Service (IANS) the race will be dropped from
the 2014 calendar and return in early 2015. The Indian Grand
Prix has been held in the autumn since being added to the F-1
program in 2011.  “October-November period suits us better both weather-wise
as well as it being festive season, but if Formula One
Management wants us to hold our race in March 2015 we don’t have
any problem with that,” Sameer Gaur, CEO of promoter Jaypee
Sports International Ltd., said in a statement.  According to the IANS, Ecclestone said at last weekend’s
Hungarian Grand Prix the Indian race was unlikely to happen in
2014 and that the reason was “political,” without providing
specific details.  A message left for Ecclestone at Formula One’s headquarters
in  London  was not immediately returned.  The 2013 Indian Grand Prix will be run Oct. 27 at the Buddh
International Circuit in  New Delhi . World champion Sebastian Vettel of Germany has won the first two editions of the race.  To contact the reporter on this story:
