China Life Insurance Co. (LFC) , the
nation’s largest insurer, climbed the most in two weeks after
saying first-half profit may rise by more than 50 percent from a
year earlier.  American depositary receipts of China Life advanced 2.8
percent to $36.53 as trading closed in  New York , the biggest
rally since July 11. The ADRs traded 2.4 percent above its
shares in  Hong Kong , the highest  premium  in three months. Each
ADR equals 15 underlying shares in the Beijing-based company.  The net income surge is attributable to an increase in
investment income combined with a decline in impairment losses,
the insurer said in a statement to Hong Kong’s stock exchange
after the local market closed, without further elaboration. The
preliminary estimate is based on unaudited numbers, it said.  China Life posted a profit of 9.6 billion  yuan  ($1.6
billion) in the first half of 2012, a 26 percent decline from
the same period in 2011. Its premium income in the first six
months of 2013 was 202.6 billion yuan, according to a July 15
filing, representing a 9.3 percent increase from a year earlier.  The Hong Kong-traded  shares  closed unchanged at HK$18.44.
They have declined 27 percent this year, compared with a 1.1
percent drop in the Hang Seng Finance Index, which tracks 12
banks, insurers and the city’s exchange operator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
