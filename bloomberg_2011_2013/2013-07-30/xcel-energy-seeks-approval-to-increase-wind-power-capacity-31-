Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL) , the largest U.S.
provider of wind power, plans to boost its wind capacity by
about 31 percent to reduce fuel costs and emissions.  Xcel is asking regulators to approve the purchase of 1,500
megawatts of U.S. wind power, including 700 megawatts in
Oklahoma, Texas and  New Mexico  announced earlier this month, the
Minneapolis-based utility said today in a statement.  Xcel, which has about 4,900 megawatts of  wind  capacity, is
seeking to add to its system three 200-megawatt projects in the
Upper Midwest and a 200-megawatt wind farm in Colorado.  These projects “provide a valuable hedge to rising and
volatile fuel prices for well into the future” and will save
customers at least $800 million over 20 years, Chief Executive
Officer Ben Fowke said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
