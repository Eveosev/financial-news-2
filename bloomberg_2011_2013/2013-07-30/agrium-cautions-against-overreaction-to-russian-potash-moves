Agrium Inc. (AGU) ,  North America ’s third-largest potash producer, cautioned against an overreaction to
plans by OAO Uralkali to opt out of a marketing joint venture.  “Comments made by Russian producers have clearly created
uncertainty in the potash market,” Richard Downey, an Agrium
spokesman, said today in an e-mail. “This is not the first time
that Russian producers have had disagreements.”  Agrium, based in Calgary, plans to continue with its
“normal course of operations,” according to the statement.  “It is important not to overreact to a single statement
from one player in the industry,” Downey said.  Agrium  fell  4.5 percent to C$89.60 at 3:15 p.m. in Toronto
after earlier dropping as much as 9 percent, the most intraday 
since Nov. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
