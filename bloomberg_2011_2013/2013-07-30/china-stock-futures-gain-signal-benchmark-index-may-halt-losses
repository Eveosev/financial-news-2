China’s stocks  rose, erasing the
benchmark index’s losses this month, as central bank measures to
ease the nation’s cash squeeze boosted financial companies and
raw-material producers.                                   .  Ping An Bank Co. and Citic Securities Co. climbed at least
2 percent, driving the biggest gains for a measure of  financial
shares  in a week. Aluminum Corp. of  China  Ltd., the biggest
producer of the metal, rose 2 percent. Losses for Chengdu Dr
Peng Telecom & Media Group Co. and Harbin Pharmaceutical Group
Co. dragged down gauges of technology and drug companies.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose for the first time in
five days, adding 0.7 percent to 1,990.06 at the close. The
index has gained 0.6 percent this month after plunging 14
percent in June. Stocks rebounded as the central bank conducted
reverse-repurchase operations for the first time in five months,
said  Zhang Gang , a strategist at Central China Securities
Holdings Co. in  Shanghai .  “The central bank is boosting liquidity in the market,
especially during the end of the month when  cash flow  is
tight,” Zhang said by phone.  The CSI 300 Index advanced 0.6 percent to 2,189.39, while
the  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  retreated less than 0.1
percent. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index slid 1.3 percent
yesterday.  Swap Rates  The Shanghai measure has fallen 12 percent this year and
trades at 8 times 12-month projected profit, approaching the
lowest level in at least five years,  data  compiled by Bloomberg
show. Today’s trading volumes were 19 percent lower than the 30-day average, while 30-day  volatility  was at 26.9, near the
highest level since December 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The People’s Bank of China added 17 billion  yuan  ($2.8
billion) to the financial system today at a yield of 4.4 percent
using seven-day reverse repos. That compares with 3.35 percent
when the contracts were last used on Jan. 31 and a Feb. 7
auction of 14-day agreements at 3.45 percent, according to
central bank data compiled by Bloomberg.  Interest-rate swaps  and
money-market rates declined.  A gauge of financial companies in the CSI 300 comprising
banks, insurers, brokerages and developers rose 1.5 percent, the
most among the 10 industry groups. Ping An Bank gained 2.9
percent to 9.68 yuan. Citic Securities, the largest brokerage,
surged 2 percent to 10.57 yuan. China Vanke Co., the biggest
developer, advanced 1.2 percent to 9.26 yuan. Poly Real Estate
Group Co. surged 1.9 percent to 9.87 yuan.  Cutting Overcapacity  A measure of material producers in the CSI 300 added 1.5
percent, the second most among the industry groups. Jiangxi
Copper Co., the largest producer of the metal, jumped 1.4
percent to 15.51 yuan. Aluminum Corp. of China, known as Chalco,
rose 2 percent to 3.12 yuan in Shanghai.  Mark Mobius , executive chairman of Templeton
 Emerging Markets  Group, said Chalco is a “good long-term bet”
as one of the few producers of the metal set to benefit from the
government’s plans to reduce overcapacity. China ordered more
than 1,400 companies in 19 industries including aluminum to ease
oversupply, according to a July 25 statement from the Ministry
of Industry and  Information Technology .  Units of Franklin Resources Inc., Templeton’s parent
company, have a combined stake of about 31 percent in Chalco,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A measure of  technology companies  slumped the most among
industry groups in the CSI 300 today. Chengdu Dr Peng plunged
7.8 percent to 14.35 yuan, trimming this month’s gain to 36
percent.  Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Co. tumbled 6.2 percent to 5.75
yuan, dragging down a gauge of health-care companies. Drug
stocks were still the best-performing industry group in July
with a 11 percent gain, followed by telecommunication’s 9.5
percent advance and technology shares’ 8.4 percent increase.  -- Editors: Allen Wan, Richard Frost  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
