Gina McCarthy, the new head of the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, vowed to tackle global
warming with actions that will help spark economic growth.  In her first public speech since taking over two weeks ago,
McCarthy today defended her agency against attacks from
Republicans in Congress, and urged companies to “embrace the
opportunity of  climate change ” as a reason to invest.  The investments “will, in turn, fuel the complementary
goals of turning America into a magnet for new jobs and
manufacturing,” McCarthy said in a speech at  Harvard Law School 
in  Boston .  McCarthy now leads an agency that lawmakers have criticized
over pollution limits that they say will cost jobs and hurt the
economy. The Republican-led U.S. House passed legislation last
year to reverse a series of EPA rules. The Senate didn’t
consider similar measures.  At the same time EPA is central to enacting President
 Barack Obama ’s pledge to counter the carbon-dioxide emissions
scientists blame for causing global warming.  The EPA has a deadline of September for issuing a new
proposal for the first-ever rules limiting carbon-dioxide
emissions from new power plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
