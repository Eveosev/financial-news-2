Asian  stocks  rose, with the regional
benchmark index heading for its first advance in five days, as
Japanese exporters gained after the yen weakened, and  China ’s
central bank injected funds into the money market.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  climbed 2.9 percent in  Tokyo  as the
yen’s weakness boosted the outlook for export income. Daiwa
Securities Group Inc.,  Japan ’s second-largest brokerage, rose
3.3 percent after posting earnings that beat analyst estimates.
Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s biggest producer of the metal,
dropped 3.2 percent in Hong Kong after copper futures declined.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index added 0.5 percent to 133.82 as
of 7:17 p.m. in Tokyo, with almost two shares rising for each
that fell. The gauge is headed for a 2.5 percent advance this
month after China pledged to do more to support transition in
the world’s second-largest economy and earnings at companies
from Daihatsu Motor Co. to Nomura Holdings Inc. beat analyst
estimates.  “As the yen continues to weaken, profit at Japanese
exporters will improve,” said  Daphne Roth , Singapore-based head
of Asia equity research at ABN Amro Private Bank, which oversees
about $207 billion. “That should drive earnings upgrades,
boosting the share market. The market will remain volatile as
investors await Japan’s economic reforms. The market is still
hung up on the prospects of the Federal Reserve’s stimulus
tapering.”  Japan’s  Topix index  rose 1.8 percent to close higher for
the first time in five days. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock
Average climbed 1.5 percent.  Fading Optimism  The Topix has climbed 34 percent this year amid optimism
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will push through reforms while the
Bank of Japan continues record stimulus to beat deflation. The
gauge traded at 1.23 times book value, compared with 2.48 for
the S&P 500 and 1.70 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  “The market is range-bound,” said Kenichi Kubo, a senior
fund manager at Tokio Marine Asset Management Co., which
oversees about $51 billion. “At the beginning of this year,
stocks extended gains on widespread optimism, but it’s not like
that now.”  Japan’s factory output declined 3.3 percent in June, the
most since March 2011 when the nation was hit by a record
earthquake. That was lower than any forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of 29 economists whose median estimate was for a 1.5
percent drop. A separate report showed the jobless rate fell to
3.9 percent in June, the lowest since 2008.  Liquidity Boost  China’s Shanghai Composite Index increased 0.7 percent,
heading for its first advance in five days. The country’s
central bank conducted reverse-repurchase operations for the
first time in five months, helping alleviate a cash squeeze that
drove the benchmark interbank lending rate to a four-week high.
The People’s Bank of China added 17 billion  yuan  ($2.8 billion)
to the financial system today at a yield of 4.4 percent using
seven-day reverse repos, according to traders.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index increased 0.5 percent. South
Korea’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  added 0.9 percent, while  Taiwan ’s Taiex
Index gained 1 percent.  Singapore ’s Straits Times Index added
0.3 percent and  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index closed little
changed. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index dropped 0.6 percent.  India ’s S&P BSE Sensex slid 1.3 percent, erasing gains of
as much as 0.4 percent, after the nation’s central bank left
interest rates unchanged.  The Asia-Pacific gauge fell 7.8 percent through yesterday
from this year’s high on May 20 amid signs China’s economic
slowdown is deepening and on concern the Federal Reserve will
start tapering monetary stimulus. Shares on the gauge traded at
12.9 times estimated earnings as of yesterday, compared with
15.3 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 13.5 times
for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  U.S. Futures  Futures on the S&P 500 Index added 0.1 percent. The gauge
fell 0.4 percent in New York yesterday as energy shares led
losses amid a plunge in natural gas and a report showed a drop
in pending home sales.  Japanese exporters rose after the yen fell as much as 0.5
percent today, heading for its first drop in four days. A weaker
yen boosts the overseas income of the nation’s carmakers and
electronics manufacturers when repatriated.  Toyota, the world’s biggest carmaker, climbed 2.9 percent
6,070 yen in Tokyo. Sony Corp., the maker of Bravia Televisions
and PlayStation game consoles, increased 2.9 percent to 2,117
yen.  Panasonic Corp. (6752) , Japan’s third-biggest TV maker, gained 2.3
percent to 864 yen.  Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) , China’s biggest Internet company,

year, advanced 4.1 percent last week after U.S. companies in the
sector surged. The company accounted for almost half of the Hang
Seng Index’s net increase today.  Earnings Performance  Daiwa Securities advanced 3.3 percent to 839 yen. Net
income rose to 57.3 billion yen ($582.4 million) for the three
months ended June 30 from 2.7 billion yen a year earlier, the
company said in a statement yesterday. The results beat the
average 51.1 billion yen estimate of six analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  Yakult Honsha Co. (2267) , a maker pro-biotic and fermented milk
drinks, surged 17 percent to 4,935 yen after saying first-quarter profit increased to 3.8 billion yen from 1 billion a
year earlier.  Of the 160 companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index that
posted results since July 1 and for which estimates are
available, 53 percent exceeded analyst estimates, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. slumped 9.3 percent to HK$5.26
