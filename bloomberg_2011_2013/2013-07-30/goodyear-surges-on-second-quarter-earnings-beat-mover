Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (GT) , the
largest U.S. tiremaker, rose the most in almost a year after
posting second-quarter earnings that beat analysts’ estimates.  Shares of the Akron, Ohio-based manufacturer climbed 8.9
percent to $18.56 in New York, the biggest one-day gain since
July 31, 2012 and highest closing price since May 2011. The
company has gained 34 percent this year, compared with an 18
percent increase in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Goodyear reported second-quarter net income of $188
million, more than double the $92 million reported in the year-earlier period and a company record for the quarter. Profit per
share, excluding one-time items, was 76 cents, exceeding the 48-cent average of seven analysts’ estimates. The company had
record operating profit in North America and Asia.  The tiremaker posted “the highest-quality beat we’ve seen
from Goodyear in a long time,”  Itay Michaeli , an analyst with
Citigroup Inc. who rates the shares a buy, wrote in a report.
“Our initial view is that Goodyear delivered on all fronts, and
then some.”  Goodyear’s North American unit had operating income of $204
million, an 8.5 percent increase from a year earlier while
revenue declined 10 percent and tire shipments slid 3.9 percent.
The unit benefited from lower raw material costs and other
expenses, according to the statement. The Asia unit’s operating
income surged 28 percent to $91 million.  “The steady delivery of improved results in North America
has been remarkable in such a low-volume environment,” Chief
Financial Officer Darren Wells said on a conference call.  The company forecast annual global operating income of $1.5
billion, at the high end of its prior projection of $1.4 billion
to $1.5 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
