Turkish Finance Minister  Mehmet Simsek  said his nation’s 4 percent growth target is
“achievable” as lower borrowing costs fuel domestic demand.  “The main story is the recovery of domestic demand on the
back of obviously looser monetary policy, neutralish fiscal
policy,” Simsek said in an interview today at the World
Economic Forum in Jordan. “It’s going to be a broad-based
recovery, not just driven by one sector.”  A deeper European recession could compromise  Turkey ’s
expansion goal, Simsek added.  “We are not banking on Europe pulling out of recession in
a big way and we’re not banking on a strong recovery, but
certainly we have not penciled in a deeper recession in
Europe,” he said. “Our numbers are reasonable and realistic on
the basis that Europe doesn’t go into deeper recession.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
