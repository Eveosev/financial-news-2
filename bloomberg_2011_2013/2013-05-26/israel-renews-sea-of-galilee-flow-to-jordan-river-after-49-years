For the first time since 1964,  Israel 
will allow Sea of Galilee water to flow into the Jordan River as
part of a rehabilitation project that will cost millions of
shekels, the Israel Water Authority said.  The project, which started today, also includes diverting
brackish water and sewage that has been flowing into the water
source, according to an e-mailed statement.  “The Jordan River is renowned abroad and we must do
everything we can to make it something to be proud of again and
guarantee that visitors continue to come,” Environmental
Protection Minister Amir Peretz said in the statement.  Christian tourists make pilgrimages to a site on the Jordan
River east of the West Bank town of Jericho where they believe
Jesus was baptized. Kayaking and tubing are also offered on the
river, which has been threatened by excessive water diversion
and pollution.  After years of drought, the Sea of Galilee, also known as
the Kinneret, is 209.96 meters below  sea level  and nearing its
maximum capacity of 208.8 meters below sea level, according to
the Water Authority website. The level in Israel’s main water
source rose as rainfall increased and desalination plants
required less water to be pumped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
