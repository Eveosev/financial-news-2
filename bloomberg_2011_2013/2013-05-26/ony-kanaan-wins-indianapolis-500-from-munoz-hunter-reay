Tony Kanaan won the Indianapolis 500
in his 12th attempt to become the third Brazilian champion at
IndyCar’s marquee event.  Kanaan cruised across the finish line at the Indianapolis
Motor Speedway under caution yesterday in two hours, 40 minutes,
3.4 seconds for a record average speed of 187.4 miles per hour
(302 kph). Carlos Munoz of Colombia, a 21-year-old rookie, was
second ahead of IndyCar champion Ryan Hunter-Reay of the U.S.  “The last lap was the longest lap of my life,” Kanaan
told ABC in a televised interview. “I wanted the pace car to
hurry up so badly.”  Kanaan, the 2004 IndyCar champion, had led the Indianapolis
500 for 221 laps coming into this year’s edition, the third-most
among drivers who hadn’t won the race. The 38-year-old, who
began from 12th place on the grid in his Chevrolet-powered KV
Racing Technology car, finished second in 2004 and has twice
been third, including in 2012.  “I wanted it all my life, but over the years I was kind of
OK with the fact that I may never have the chance to win,”
Kanaan said.  Kanaan took the lead for good just before 2012 winner Dario Franchitti crashed on lap 197, bringing up the final yellow flag
of the day.  Franchitti, a Scot, and Helio Castroneves of  Brazil  failed
to join A.J. Foyt, Rick Mears and Al Unser as four-time winners.
The only other Brazilian winner was Emerson Fittipaldi, in 1989
and 1993. Castroneves won in 2001, 2002 and 2009.  There were a record 68 lead changes yesterday, double the
previous mark set last year, and a record 14 different drivers
held first place over 200 laps at the 2.5-mile (4 km) track.  Dubbed the “Greatest Spectacle in Racing,” the open-wheel
race in which drivers reach speeds of 220 mph (354 kph) featured
33 cars powered by Chevrolet and Honda engines.  First Caution  The first yellow caution flag appeared on lap 3 after J.R. Hildebrand hit the outside wall. Hildebrand hit the wall while
leading going into the final turn of the 100th anniversary
edition two years ago, allowing  Dan Wheldon  to win for the
second time. Wheldon was killed at the age of 33 five months
later, following a crash at the 2011 IndyCar World Championship
in  Las Vegas .  Marco Andretti and Kanaan jockeyed for the lead through the
opening 30 laps and by the halfway mark newcomer A.J.
Allmendinger was running in first place.  There were 38 lead changes through the first 130 laps and
Andretti was back in the lead with 50 laps to go. With a quarter
of the race remaining, there had been 13 different leaders and
45 lead changes.  Andretti, the 26-year-old son of 1991 IndyCar champion
Michael Andretti and the grandson of 1969 Indianapolis 500
winner  Mario Andretti , was back in the lead with 25 laps to race
after the 57th lead change of the day.  Final Stages  Andretti made his final pit stop on lap 181, ceding the
lead to Munoz, who stopped four laps later. James Hinchcliffe
moved ahead to take the number of lead changes to 63 before
pulling into Pit Road on lap 188, handing Hunter-Reay the lead.  Kanaan and Hunter-Reay traded first place on laps 192 and
193 before a crash by Graham Rahal brought out the pace car.
Kanaan and Munoz passed Hunter-Reay on the restart going into
Turn 1 before Franchitti’s crash brought about the final yellow
flag, allowing Kanaan to drive to the win unchallenged over the
last two laps.  For the second straight year since 1999, there was no
American woman on the starting grid, following Danica Patrick’s
defection to Nascar. Brazilian Ana Beatriz finished 15th, two
places ahead of Simona de Silvestro from  Switzerland , while
Katherine Legge and Pippa Mann, both from the U.K., placed 27th
and 30th respectively.  The total purse for the race depends on attendance. Last
year, Franchitti earned $2.47 million for his third win in six
years. The Scot collected a record $2.75 million from the $13.6
million payout in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
