Seven-time Grand Slam singles
champion  Venus Williams  was ousted from the opening round of the
French Open by  Poland ’s Urszula Radwanska.  Williams of the U.S. lost 7-6 (7-5), 6-7 (4-7), 6-4 to
Radwanska in a match full of service breaks and long rallies on
the Court Suzanne Lenglen which took three hours, 19 minutes.  It was her earliest defeat in a major since Williams was
knocked out of the opening round of Wimbledon last year.
Williams, 32, was playing in her 59th Grand Slam event, the most
among active players on the women’s tour. Her best result in
Paris dates back to 2002, when she lost in the final to her
younger sister and women’s top seed, Serena.  Williams, a five-time Wimbledon champion now ranked 30th,
was diagnosed with the energy-sapping Sjogren’s syndrome in
2011. She has since struggled during some of her matches with
stamina and strength, and has also had several injuries that
kept her away from the women’s tour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
