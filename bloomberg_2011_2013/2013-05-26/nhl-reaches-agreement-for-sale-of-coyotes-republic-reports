The  National Hockey League  has
reached agreement for the sale of the  Phoenix Coyotes , the
Arizona Republic reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The NHL has scheduled a meeting for May 28 with the mayor
of Glendale, Arizona, to discuss the management of the
Jobing.com Arena, according to the report.  NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman will meet with Mayor Jerry Weiers, who told him not to schedule talks until the ownership
plan for the Coyotes is in place, the newspaper said, citing the
mayor.  The city has opened bidding for management of the arena to
anyone, although the new Coyotes owners would be expected to
want it, the Republic said.  The league, which purchased the Coyotes in bankruptcy four
years ago, has been negotiating with Renaissance Sports &
Entertainment, headed by Canadian businessman George Gosbee and
Anthony LeBlanc, a former  Research in Motion Ltd. (BB)  executive.  To contact the reporter on this story:
