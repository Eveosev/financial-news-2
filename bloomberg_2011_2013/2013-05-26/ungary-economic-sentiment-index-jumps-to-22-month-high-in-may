Hungary ’s  economic-sentiment  index
jumped to its strongest level in nearly two years in May, driven
by higher consumer and business confidence.  The index rose to minus 16.7, the best reading since July
2011, from minus 21.7 in April, the GKI research institute in
Budapest said in an e-mailed statement. The consumer-confidence
gauge improved to minus 34.4 from minus 38.9, while business
confidence increased to minus 10.5 from minus 15.6, the
strongest since April 2011.  Hungary’s  economy  exited a recession in the first quarter,
boosting Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s quest to have the
European Union lift its excessive-deficit procedure against the
country. Orban may raise the EU’s highest bank tax further and
introduce a levy on advertising to ensure the budget  deficit 
stays below a limit of 3 percent of economic output.  Expectations for Hungary’s economic performance improved
“significantly both among businesses and consumers,” GKI said.
Consumers were the most optimistic in over two years, it said.  GKI’s indexes are calculated as a balance of positive and
negative answers to questions about the outlook for the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
