Saudi Arabia  may need to persuade
OPEC members to cut output to help keep oil prices above $100
level through the rest of the year, according to the Kingdom’s
largest lender by assets  National Commercial Bank .  Producers in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries need to make the cuts in the second quarter and bring
production to the current official target level of 30 million
barrels a day, the Jeddah-based bank, known as NCB, said in an
e-mailed report today.  “While Saudi Arabia has been willing to make large cuts to
production in the past, its resolve to continue will be tested
if other OPEC members raise their own production during 2013,”
it said. Maintaining  oil prices  above $100 for the rest of 2013,
“may prove to be a more difficult proposition than if the
Kingdom were to act unilaterally as in the recent past,” it
said.  OPEC’s 12 members pumped 30.5 million barrels a day of
crude in May, according to the group’s latest monthly market
report published May 10. The group, which supplies about 40
percent of the world’s oil, has an official production ceiling
of 30 million barrels. Demand for crude from OPEC will average
29.8 million barrels a day in 2013, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
