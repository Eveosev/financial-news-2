Boo Weekley ended a five-year wait
for a third title on golf’s U.S.  PGA Tour  with a one-shot
victory at the Crowne Plaza Invitational.  Weekley had a final-round 4-under-par 66 yesterday for a
four-round total of 14-under-par 266 at Colonial Country Club in
 Fort Worth ,  Texas , where Ben Hogan was a member.  “Finally made it back,” Weekley said in a televised
interview. “I finally get my name up there on that wall with
Ben Hogan and some of the great ones that played here.”  Weekley’s two prior victories on tour came at the 2007 and
2008 Heritage. The winner of that event gets a red plaid jacket,
almost identical to the one given to the champion at Colonial
each year. Yesterday’s win was worth $1.15 million to Weekley.  Matt Kuchar  had a birdie at the last hole to finish second
at 13-under after a 2-under-par 68 in the fourth round.  Zach Johnson , the 2010 and 2012 champion, was a shot further back in
third place.  Kuchar sank a birdie putt of about 50 feet (15 meters) at
the 12th hole to cut Weekley’s lead to one shot. Weekley replied
with his own long putt for birdie at No. 13 to re-open a two-shot advantage. At about the same time, Johnson had a birdie at
No. 17 to join Kuchar at 12-under.  With Weekley atop the leaderboard, every shot he played was
accompanied by an elongated chorus of “Boo” from the
galleries. The 39-year-old Floridian almost holed his second
shot at the par-4 14th before missing the birdie attempt from
about three feet. Weekley missed another short putt for birdie
at the 17th.  At the last hole, Weekley almost sank a long putt for
birdie before tapping in. Kuchar, in the last group, then
drained his birdie attempt from about 30 feet to claim second
place outright.  The tour now moves to Dublin,  Ohio , for the $6.2 million
Memorial Tournament, where  Tiger Woods  is scheduled to defend
the title he won for a fifth time in 2012. Woods has four titles
in seven starts this season on the PGA Tour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
