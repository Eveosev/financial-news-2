Stockholm ’s suburbs experienced the
calmest night since rioting started a week ago as extra police
and volunteers patrolled affected neighborhoods.  About 20 cars were set on fire and a school and store in a
southern suburb were vandalized, Stockholm police spokesman
Kjell Lindgren said today by phone. Rocks were thrown at police
in Vaarberg, south of Stockholm. Police arrested 32 people last
night for “social unrest,” of which 11 were detained as a
preventive measure.  “We think that we’re seeing a trend that’s heading back to
normal, though we’re not there yet” Lindgren said.  The shooting of a 69-year-old local resident of Portuguese
origin has been cited as reason for the riots by Megafonen, a
group that claims to speak for inhabitants in Husby. Mats
Lofven, Chief Commissioner of the Stockholm police, said May 24
that three types of individuals were involved in the riots:
local youth, known criminals, and a small group of violent
extreme-leftist “professional activists,”  Svenska Dagbladet 
reported.  In Husby, where rioting started seven days ago, residents
held a barbeque in front of a vandalized subway station entrance
and put up a large TV screen showing the Champions League soccer
finale between Bayern Muenchen and  Borussia Dortmund , Dagens
Nyheter reported.  Three cars belonging to the social services’ elderly care
unit were set on fire in Lysekil, north of Gothenburg. Police
said it was probably related to the events in Stockholm, state-run Sveriges Radio reported.  To contact the reporter on the story:
