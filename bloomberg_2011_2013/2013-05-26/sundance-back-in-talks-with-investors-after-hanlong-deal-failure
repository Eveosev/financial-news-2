Sundance Resources Ltd. (SDL) , the iron ore
developer that last month scrapped a deal to be taken over by
China’s Sichuan Hanlong Group, said it’s begun talks with
potential partners about investing in its $4.7 billion project.  “These groups come from a range of countries and have
widely diversified interests in areas such as resource projects,
infrastructure provision and steelmaking,” Perth-based Sundance
said today in a statement. “They have also expressed a range of
views about how it would be possible to structure transactions
which bring them into the” Mbalam project.  Sundance in April terminated a A$1.14 billion ($1.1
billion) takeover accord after Hanlong was unable to secure
funding for its African iron ore project, adding it was in talks
with other groups about selling stakes in the project. The
collapse of the deal, first agreed in October 2011, came after
Hanlong’s billionaire Chairman Liu Han was reported to have been
detained in March by police in  China .  “While some of these talks are more advanced than others,
all current discussions remain incomplete and confidential,”
Sundance said. Discussions include port and rail solutions, as
well as direct investment in the iron ore project, which
straddles Cameroon and Republic of Congo.  Sundance gained 1.3 percent to 8 cents in Sydney trading on
May 24, giving it a market value of A$246 million. Its shares
have declined about 80 percent over the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
