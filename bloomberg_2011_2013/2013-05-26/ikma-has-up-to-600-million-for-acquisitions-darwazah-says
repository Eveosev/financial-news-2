Hikma Pharmaceuticals Plc (HIK)  has as much
as $600 million to fund acquisitions in the  Middle East  and
Africa and hopes to close a second deal this year after buying
Egyptian Company for Pharmaceuticals & Chemical Industries.  “We currently have a war chest of between $400 million and
$600 million for acquisitions,” Mazen Darwazah, Chief Executive
Officer for the Middle East and North Africa, said in an
interview at the World Economic Forum in Jordan today. “We’re
looking in Turkey, the Middle East, Africa and the former Soviet
Union states.”  Hikma, based in London, expects to close one “small or
medium-size” acquisition this year, Darwazah said. The company
also plans to invest more than $100 million in sub-Saharan,
western and eastern Africa through acquisitions and new
business, he said.  Hikma in January agreed to buy Egyptian Company for
Pharmaceuticals & Chemical Industries for about $22.2 million in
cash. The company also expanded its business in 2010 with a $112
million purchase from  Baxter International Inc. (BAX)   Hikma last month said it will keep its injectable-drug
business after concluding a review of the unit, saying the long-term growth potential is excellent. The company said it was
considering a possible sale after receiving unsolicited
approaches for the business, the second-biggest by volume in the
U.S.  Amgen Inc. (AMGN)  and  Novartis AG (NOVN)  were among the companies that
expressed interest, and the operation could have fetched $2
billion in a sale, two people with knowledge of the matter said
in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
