Italian golfer Matteo Manassero won
on the fourth hole of a three-man playoff to take the BMW PGA
Championship title and become the youngest-ever victor in the
European Tour’s flagship event.  Former champion Simon Khan of  England , Marc Warren of
Scotland and Manassero had finished level on 10-under-par 278
after regulation play at Wentworth, southern England.  It was the 20-year-old’s fourth win on the European Tour
and he picked up a check for 792,000 euros ($1.02 million).  The start of the tournament was overshadowed by controversy
when Tiger Woods said he was hurt by a perceived racist comment
from Spain’s Sergio Garcia. Garcia apologized for the remark,
saying it was “stupid and out of place” and wasn’t meant to
have a racial intent.  European Tour Chief Executive Officer George O’Grady then
apologized for his own reference to “colored athletes.”  Garcia finished down the field on 5-under.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
