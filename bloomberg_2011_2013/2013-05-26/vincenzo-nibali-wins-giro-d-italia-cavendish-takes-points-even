Vincenzo Nibali won the Giro d’Italia
cycling race for the first time after beating out competition
from Rigoberto Uran and former Tour de  France  champion Cadel
Evans.  Nibali, an Italian who rides for the Astana team, won the
overall classification by 4 minutes, 43 seconds from Colombia’s
Uran, with  Australia ’s Evans more than a minute further back.
British sprinter Mark Cavendish won the mainly flat final stage,
over 122 miles to Brescia, to clinch victory in the points
category.  It’s a second so-called Grand Tour win for the 28-year-old
Nibali, who also won the 2010 Vuelta a Espana. He was third
behind Team Sky duo Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome at last
year’s Tour de France. Nibali changed to the Astana team from
Liquigas after last season.  Wiggins, 33, quit the 21-stage Giro before the start of the
13th stage because of a worsening chest infection. The Briton
had been the pre-race favorite with several U.K. bookmakers.  Cavendish, who took the sprinters’ red jersey back from
Nibali today, has also won the points classification in the
other Grand Tours, the 2010 Vuelta and the 2011 Tour de France.  To contact the reporters on this story:
