Dubai’s benchmark  index (SASEIDX)  declined the
most in more than a month on concern slower global economic
growth may hurt company earnings.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , the developer of the world’s tallest
building, retreated to the lowest in more than a week.  Dubai
Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB) , the United Arab Emirates’ largest Shariah-compliant lender, decreased the most since May 9. The DFM
General  Index (KWSEIDX)  lost 1.1 percent to 2,281.27 at the close in the
emirate, bringing the two-day drop to 1.8 percent.  Abu Dhabi ’s
 benchmark  fell 1 percent. The declines pared the gauges’ gains
this year to 41 percent and 30 percent, respectively  The MSCI  Emerging Markets   Index (DSM)  lost 1.8 percent last week,
the most since the week ended April 5, after Chinese
manufacturing contracted for the first time in seven months and
amid concern the  Federal Reserve  will scale back asset
purchases. The economy of Dubai, home to the world’s biggest
airline by international traffic, is underpinned by trade,
tourism and real-estate.  The Chinese data and the Fed comments are “the catalysts
for the decline in the U.A.E. markets,” said Sebastien Henin,
Abu Dhabi-based portfolio manager at The National Investor. “We
are still in a cycle of profit takings.”  Dubai’s and Abu Dhabi’s benchmarks are among the 10 best
performing this year of 94 gauges tracked globally by Bloomberg.  Emaar lost 1.6 percent to 5.72 dirhams, the lowest price
since May 14, and Dubai Islamic Bank decreased 2.5 percent. Abu
Dhabi-based  First Gulf Bank PJSC (FGB)  dropped 3.1 percent to 13.95
dirhams after Kuwait-based Global Investment House cut the bank
to hold. The bank was the biggest decliner by  index (DFMGI)  points on
the emirate’s benchmark.  Kuwait’s Increase  Elsewhere in the  Middle East , Kuwait’s SE Price  Index (TA-25)
