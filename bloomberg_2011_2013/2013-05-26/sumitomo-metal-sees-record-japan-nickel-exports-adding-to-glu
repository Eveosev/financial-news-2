Nickel exports from  Japan  may climb
to a record this year as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s stimulus
hasn’t spurred demand in the third-biggest user, adding to a
global glut, the country’s top producer said.  Exports will rise 10 percent from a year earlier to 96,000
metric tons, Toru Higo, general manager of nickel sales and raw
materials at Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., said in an interview.
The global surplus may expand to 70,000 tons, the biggest in
five years, he said. Morgan Stanley forecast a surplus of 38,100
tons, Macquarie Group Ltd. sees 82,000 tons and the
International Nickel Study Group predicts 90,000 tons.  The metal, used for corrosion resistance in stainless steel,
tumbled into a  bear market  on May 1 and has lost 13 percent in
the past year, making it the worst performer among six-base
metals on the London Metal Exchange. Abe’s policy of ending
deflation through unprecedented monetary stimulus, dubbed as
Abenomics, weakened the yen to a 4 1/2-year low against the
dollar and improved earnings of Japanese exporters including
Toyota Motor Corp. and  Canon Inc. (7751)   “Domestic demand from the stainless  steel industry  remains
subdued and the benefits from the yen’s weakness and higher
stock market have yet to be felt,” Higo said on May 24.  Japan’s nickel production will climb 5.8 percent to 183,000
tons in 2013, while demand may drop 2.8 percent to 139,000 tons,
Higo said. The company expanded capacity by 59 percent at its
Niihama refinery earlier this year to 65,000 tons, he said,
adding that the plan had been in the pipeline for year.  Record Stockpiles  Nickel for three-month delivery traded at $14,945 a ton on
the LME at 4:30 p.m. in  Tokyo  on May 24. Stockpiles monitored by
the exchange reached a  record  180,024 tons, data from the bourse
showed May 23.  China  and the U.S. are the biggest consumers, International
Nickel Study Group data shows. China’s production of nickel  pig
iron , a substitute for low-grade ore, will increase to 350,000
tons this year, Higo said.  A pick-up in nickel pig iron usage by Chinese stainless
steelmakers will curb their appetite for nickel, reducing metal
prices, Higo said. Demand from China will increase by 8.5
percent to 830,000 tons in 2013, while output including pig iron
will grow 10 percent to 540,000 tons, he said. China accounts
for 47 percent of global demand, he said.  World stainless-steel output may rise 1.7 percent to 36.5
million tons in 2013 from its January estimate, Higo said.
Output by China will rise 3.7 percent to 16.8 million tons, he
said.  Asia  accounts for 70 percent of global stainless steel
production, according to the International Stainless Steel Forum.  To contact the reporters on this story:
