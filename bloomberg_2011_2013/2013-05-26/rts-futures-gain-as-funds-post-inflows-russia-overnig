Russian  stock futures  climbed and a
measure of expected swings in the  contracts (VEA)  declined on
speculation demand for the cheapest emerging-market equities may
revive after the benchmark index’s biggest drop in a year.  Contracts on Moscow’s dollar-denominated RTS Index due in
June rose 0.4 percent to 139,220 in New York hours May 24 while
the RTS Volatility Index dropped 5.1 percent to 23.24. The
Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded Russian
stocks in the U.S. sank 2.2 percent last week to 92.01, plunging
for a third week. OAO Rostelecom had the steepest decline on the
gauge, while CTC Media Inc. surged. Russia’s benchmark  Micex
Index (INDEXCF)  tumbled 1.5 percent for a second week of declines.  Russia-dedicated funds posted a third consecutive week of
inflows in the period ended May 22, the longest stretch since
the third quarter of 2012, said  Cameron Brandt , research
director at EPFR Global. Stocks on the Micex, the  cheapest  of 21
emerging-market benchmarks tracked by Bloomberg, trade at an
average multiple of 5.2 times estimated earnings, compared with
a ratio of 13.8 for  India ’s S&P BSE Sensex index.  “That is quite a shift,” Brandt said on May 24 by phone
from Cambridge,  Massachusetts , referring to the inflows.
“Russian equities represent a pocket of value to some people.”  The Bloomberg Russia-US gauge has retreated 7.4 percent
this year, compared with a 1.4 percent gain for the Sensex. The
Micex is down 6.4 percent. The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the
largest dedicated Russian exchange-traded fund, lost 0.8 percent
to $26.92 on May 24 and was unchanged from the previous week.
The Micex gauge fell to 1,380.88, the lowest since May 16.  CTC, Rostelecom  “Chances are the market will gain,” Igor Nuzhdin, an
analyst at Alfa Capital Management, which oversees 80 billion
rubles of equities and fixed-income securities, said by phone
from Moscow on May 24. “We are seeing a return in interest to
 emerging markets  and particularly Russia as inflows in Russia-dedicated funds increase.”  CTC Media Inc. (CTCM) , the Nasdaq-listed Russian television
network, climbed 8.1 percent to $12.54 last week in New York.
The Moscow-based company, which will repurchase 2.5 million
shares on the market by March 4, 2014, has gained 61 percent
this year.  Rostelecom, the Moscow-based phone provider, slid 6.8
percent to a one-month low of $20.50 on the week.  Yandex NV (YNDX) , the nation’s biggest Internet company, fell 6.8
percent last week to $27.04, the first drop in five weeks.  Russian regulator Roskomnadzor included VKontakte, the
country’s biggest social network, to the list of banned websites
“by mistake”, making it unavailable in St. Petersburg, the
Chita and Urals regions for several hours on May 24, the
regulator’s spokesman spokesman Vladimir Pikov said by phone May
24.  Borrowing Costs  Lowering the refinancing rate to between 5 percent and 6
percent from 8.25 percent would allow banks to reduce loan costs
and make “a big difference for the industry,” Andrey Kostin,
chief executive of VTB Group,  Russia ’s second-largest state
bank, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV’s Ryan Chilcote in
London May 21.  Kostin’s appeal added to months of government calls for
policy makers to cut borrowing costs to spur economic growth
amid Russia’s slowest expansion since a 2009 contraction. First
Deputy Chairman Alexey Ulyukaev said at an investment conference
in London May 21 “the situation from the economic point of view
has more or less stabilized” and further easing isn’t
warranted.  Crude Sinks  Futures expiring in June on Russia’s ruble showed the
currency little changed at 31.74 per dollar, after gaining 0.3
percent to 31.32 in Moscow on May 24. The currency strengthened
0.2 percent to 35.467 against the dollar-euro basket used by the
central bank.  Crude for July delivery dropped 1.9 percent last week,  the
most in a month, to $94.15 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Brent oil for July settlement increased 0.2 percent to
$102.64 on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe exchange May 24. Urals
crude, Russia’s major export blend, slid 1.6 percent last week
to $102.10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
