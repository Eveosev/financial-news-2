Nigerian police rescued four foreign
oil workers abducted on April 22 off the coast of Bayelsa state,
in the Niger River delta, authorities said today.  Obaya Marak and Mikhail Teresgji from  Russia , and Vadym
Shytov and Oleksiv Ishmyetvev from the Ukraine, were rescued on
May 22 in the Borokiri area of Port Harcourt, the Rivers State
capital, Angela Gabe, spokeswoman of the state police command
said by phone. The rescued oil workers are in a stable
condition, she said.  Nigeria, Africa’s top oil producer, has seen a renewed
surge of violence targeting the industry by armed groups that
either steal crude oil from pipelines or kidnap oil workers for
ransom. Attacks had declined after thousands of militants
fighting for a greater share of the region’s oil wealth for its
inhabitants, accepted a government amnesty in 2009 and disarmed.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Exxon Mobil Corp.,  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ,
 Total SA (FP)  and  Eni SpA (ENI)  run joint ventures with state-owned
Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. that pump more than 90 percent
of the country’s crude.  To contact the reporters on this story:
