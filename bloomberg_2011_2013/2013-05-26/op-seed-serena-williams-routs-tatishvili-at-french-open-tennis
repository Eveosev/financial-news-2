Women’s top seed Serena Williams
routed Anna Tatishvili, 6-0, 6-1, to move to the second round of
the French Open.  Williams last year lost in the opening round of Roland
Garros, where she last won the title in 2002. She has since
dropped only three matches and returned to the top spot in
women’s tennis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
