Jose Mourinho has agreed on a four-year contract worth more than 50 million pounds ($75 million) to
manage Chelsea for a second time, the Sunday Times reported.  Mourinho, currently at Real Madrid, will be the highest-paid coach ever in the Premier League, making over 8.5 million
pounds a year after tax, the newspaper added.  His return to Chelsea, where he won two league titles, was
sealed during talks with Blues owner Roman Abramovich last week,
the Times said, without identifying its sources.  Heâ€™ll sign the contract soon after his last match as Real
manager on June 1, the Times said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
