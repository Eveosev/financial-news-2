England took control on day three of
the second cricket Test after dismissing  New Zealand  for 174 in
its first innings.  Earlier, England was all out for 354 after resuming on
337-7 at Headingley, Leeds. It included 104 by Joe Root, playing
on his home ground as he made his first Test century.  England’s  Graeme Swann  took 4-42, while New Zealand’s top
scorer Peter Fulton got 28 runs. England didn’t enforce the
“follow on” and by close of play today had reached 116-1, with
captain Alastair Cook 88 not out. That gave the hosts a lead of
296 runs. Jonathan Trott is on 11.  Rain wiped out play on the opening day of the match.
England leads the two-match series 1-0 following its 170-run win
at Lord’s in London.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
