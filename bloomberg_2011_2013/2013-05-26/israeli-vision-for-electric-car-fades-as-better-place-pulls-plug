Better Place LLC, the electric car
venture backed by  Israel ’s President Shimon Peres as a way to
wean the world off oil dependence, will shut down after failing
to attract new investments.  Better Place, which in January 2012 started its first
commercial roll-out with 100 electric cars to Israeli customers,
filed a motion for liquidation with the Lod district court
today, according to an e-mailed statement from the company.
Billionaire Idan Ofer’s Israel Corp., the largest investor in
the company with an about 30 percent stake, said in a separate
statement its board decided against the investment.  “This is a difficult day for all of us,” said Dan Cohen,
the company’s third CEO in just under a year. “Unfortunately,
after a year’s commercial operation, it was clear to us that
despite many satisfied customers, the wider public take-up would
not be sufficient and that the support from the car producers
was not forthcoming.”  The car’s low performance and relatively high price
compared with conventional vehicles proved too big a hurdle as
Better Place, founded by former  SAP AG (SAP)  executive Shai Agassi,
failed to attract enough customers. The Palo Alto, California-based startup was in partnership with  Renault SA (RNO)  to build and
operate electric-car charging networks and battery-exchanging
stations and had raised $750 million since it was founded five
years ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
