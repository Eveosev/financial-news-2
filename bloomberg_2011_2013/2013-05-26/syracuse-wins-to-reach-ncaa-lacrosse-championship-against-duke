Top-seeded  Syracuse University  will
face No. 7  Duke University  in tomorrow’s national men’s college
lacrosse championship.  Syracuse beat fourth-seeded Denver 9-8 yesterday in the
semifinals and Duke topped Cornell 16-14 at Lincoln Financial
Field in Philadelphia.  Derek Maltz scored a goal with 20 seconds left in the game
to break an 8-8 tie and give the Orange a place in the National
Collegiate Athletic Association championship game for the first
time since 2009.  Luke Cometti led Syracuse with three goals and Maltz and
JoJo Marasco each had two goals.  “The defense played amazing down the stretch,” Marasco
said in a televised interview. “The offense did the work we had
to do.”  Denver had a 5-2 lead at the half before Syracuse rallied
with five goals in the final quarter.  In the first semifinal, Duke had a 7-6 halftime advantage
before scoring seven goals while holding the Big Red to one in
the third quarter. Cornell answered with seven goals to Duke’s
two in the fourth period.  “Cornell was a great team. With 16 seniors you knew they
weren’t going to give up,” Duke coach John Danowski said in a
televised interview.  Jordan Wolf had four goals and Jake Tripucka scored three
goals for the seventh-seeded Blue Devils.  Cornell attackman Rob Pannell had five goals and two
assists to set an NCAA record with 354 career points. He
surpassed Duke’s Matt Danowski, who had 353 points and watched
the game from the sidelines as a first-year assistant coach for
the Blue Devils.  To contact the reporter on this story:
