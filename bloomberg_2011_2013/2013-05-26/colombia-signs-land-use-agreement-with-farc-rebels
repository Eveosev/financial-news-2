Colombia signed an agreement on  land
use  with the nation’s biggest guerrilla group as part of peace
talks to end a half-century-long conflict, President  Juan Manuel Santos  said.  The deal was announced today in Havana, where the
government began talks with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia six months ago. Land is the first issue on a  six-point
agenda  for the negotiations, Santos said in a  statement  posted
on the presidential website.  Talks with the Marxist guerrilla group aimed at ending
Latin America’s longest running civil conflict began in October.
Military victories over the group have opened up swathes of
countryside for companies to explore for crude, coal and gold,
with state-run oil producer  Ecopetrol SA (EC)  expanding drilling into
areas previously under rebel control.  “We truly celebrate this fundamental step in Havana
towards a full agreement to put an end to half a century of
conflict,” Santos said. “We continue with the process
prudently and responsibly.”  The deal with the group known as the FARC covers land
rights, farming and investment in infrastructure, housing and
water supply, Radio Caracol  reported .  The next round of talks will begin June 11, the Bogota-based radio station said, citing comments made during a press
conference today in  Havana .  To contact the reporter on this story:
