Britain’s Carl Froch outpointed
Mikkel Kessler in their 12-round, super-middleweight clash in
 London  yesterday, avenging his loss to the Dane three years ago.  Froch, 35, added Kessler’s World Boxing Association super-middleweight title to his International Boxing Federation crown.  “The only thing that feels bad is that I have had to beat
such a real gentleman, a real warrior and real nice man,” Froch
said in a televised interview. “He did hurt me a couple of
times; I think everybody saw that. But I hurt him a little bit
more and I thought I deserved the win.”  The judges scored the bout at the O2 Arena 118-110, 116-112
and 115-113 to Froch, who connected with 261 of 1,034 punches
thrown, for a 25 percent strike rate. Kessler threw 497 punches,
landing 194, or 39 percent.  “It was a very tough fight, and I was tired in the end,
but it is nice to fight a warrior who wants to fight,” Kessler
said.  Three years ago, Froch (31-2, 22 knockouts) surrendered his
unbeaten record to Kessler, 33, when the Danish fighter won on
points.  Froch, of Nottingham,  England , fought at 167 pounds, while
Kessler (46-3, 35 knockouts), of Copenhagen, was one pound
lighter.  Froch now seeks revenge for his other loss --against U.S.
boxer Andre Ward, who won by unanimous decision on Dec. 17, 2011
at the Boardwalk Hall in  Atlantic City ,  New Jersey . Froch said
he wants to meet the 29-year-old opponent (26-0, 14 knockouts)
on home territory.  “What a fantastic fighter he is and a great, great
champion, but he is there to be beaten,” Froch said of Ward.
“But not over in America - let’s get him over here. I went over
to America and now let’s get him over to England.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
