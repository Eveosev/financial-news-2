Denmark’s government repeated an
estimate for how much it will need to borrow this year as the
nation’s haven status keeps bond yields close to record lows.  The Finance Ministry predicted a domestic financing need
for 2013 of 139 billion kroner ($24.1 billion), unchanged from a
December estimate, it said yesterday in a statement on its
website. The government’s total financing need was also
maintained at 164 billion kroner. It didn’t publish an estimate
for 2014.  Denmark’s AAA rated government bond market emerged as a
haven from the euro area’s fiscal crisis last year as the
Scandinavian nation keeps public debt at less than half the
average in the single currency bloc. That’s pushed Danish
borrowing costs lower and helped stimulate the economy as it
struggles to surface from a housing slump.  The government is due to publish its complete budget and
economic forecasts today after 10 a.m. in Copenhagen. The $300
billion economy contracted 0.7 percent in the final quarter of
2012 as housing losses quelled consumer spending and businesses
shelved investments.  The administration of Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt
has said it can’t afford to provide further stimulus measures
and argues fiscal restraint is the best way to support
households by keeping borrowing costs low.  The Danish central bank uses monetary policy to keep the
krone pegged to the euro. It has kept its deposit rate below
zero since July to counter a capital influx. The benchmark
lending rate is 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
