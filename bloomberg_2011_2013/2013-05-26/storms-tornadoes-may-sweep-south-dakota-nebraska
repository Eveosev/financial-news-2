Severe thunderstorms and possibly
tornadoes may strike parts of  South Dakota  and Nebraska this
week, according to the U.S.  Storm Prediction Center .  As many as 75,398 people live in the area, which includes
Pierre, South Dakota, the state’s capital, where storms are
expected to strike on May 29, the center said.  “It appears the most probable concentration for severe --
including possibly tornadic storms -- will be in the eastern
part of the high Plains,” according to a bulletin from the in
Norman, Oklahoma-based center, which is part of the  National
Weather Service .  Last week, an EF-5 tornado, the strongest on the six-step
Enhanced Fujita Scale, ripped through Moore,  Oklahoma , killing
24 people, including 10 children, and destroying at least 1,300
homes. The storm was part of a larger system of severe weather
that spawned tornadoes from  Texas  to New England, as well as
thunder and hail storms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
