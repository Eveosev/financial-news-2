Former U.S. Senate Majority Leader
Bob Dole called the current gridlock in Congress unreal and
chided his fellow Republicans for not getting more done.  “They ought to put a sign on the national committee doors
that says closed for repairs until New Year’s Day next year and
spend that time going over ideas and positive agendas,” Dole,
who left Congress in 1996, said today on “Fox News Sunday.”  Congress has been hamstrung by increasingly partisan
battles over topics such as reducing the deficit and expanding
health care. Only 16 percent of Americans approve of the job
Congress is doing, according to a May 2-7 Gallup  survey . Dole,
who represented  Kansas  in the U.S. House and then the Senate for
35 years, called himself a mainstream conservative Republican,
and said he doubted if he or former President Ronald Reagan
could make it in today’s Republican party.  Dole also chided President  Barack Obama , a Democrat, saying
he lacks communication skills with his own party, as well as
with Republicans, and is on the road too much.  “I’m not a critic of the president, but I think one
mistake he’s made was not getting together more with Congress
earlier on, in his first administration,” Dole said. When asked
if the Senate is broken, he replied, “well, it’s bent really
badly.”  Dole, 89, was the Republican nominee in the 1996 U.S.
presidential election, which he lost to Democrat Bill Clinton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
