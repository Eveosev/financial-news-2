SAP AG (SAP) ’s German works council said
it’s concerned about a shift in the balance of power within the
company’s leadership toward the U.S.,  Euro am Sonntag  reported,
citing an internal message by Stefan Kohl, works council chief,
and his deputy, Christiane Kuntz-Mayer.  The workers are prepared to “contribute with all available
means to ensure the relevance of Germany as a location,” the
newspaper cited the message as saying.  SAP on April 20 set up a global managing board to assist
its executive board, and named U.S.-based managers Robert Enslin
and Lars Dalgaard to the new body.  To contact the reporter on this story:
