EuroChem,  Russia ’s largest
fertilizer maker by revenue, is considering spinning off its
potash business, billionaire Chairman Andrey Melnichenko told
the  Vedomosti  daily in an interview.  EuroChem has projects to build two potash mines in Russia
with combined capacity of 8 million metric tons a year, the
newspaper said. EuroChem will be able to process only 1 million
tons of these volumes into complex fertilizers, which is why it
may spin off its potash business into a separate entity,
Vedomosti cited Melnichenko as saying.  EuroChem may consider an initial public offering of shares
once it builds the potash mines and spins off the business,
Melnichenko told Vedomosti.  Melnichenko, 40, himself holds “slightly less than 10
percent” in German potash producer  K+S AG (SDF) , according to the
interview. EuroChem cut its stake in K+S to about 1 percent, the
German company said March 27.  Melnichenko’s fortune was valued at $10.8 billion by the
 Forbes  magazine’s Russian edition published this month. He also
controls coal producer Siberian Coal Energy Co., or Suek, and
coal-fueled power generators in Siberia and Russia’s Far East.  To contact the reporter on this story:
