U.K. Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith told the Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  that
he rejects a plan in last monthâ€™s budget to cut welfare spending
by an extra 10 billion pounds ($16.3 billion) from 2014 and
2016, the Times of  London  reported citing an interview.  Reform, not cuts alone, is the key to long-term savings and
the government has a responsibility to support the poor, Duncan
Smith said in the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
