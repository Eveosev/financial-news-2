Bundesbank Board member Joachim Nagel said the  European Central Bank  should start refocusing on
its primary mandate of inflation fighting soon.  “That is the ECB’s and the euro-area central banks’
primary task, which they have fulfilled successfully since the
introduction of the euro, completely independently of
governments,” Nagel said, according to the text of a speech due
for delivery in Munich today.  Nagel said the ECB’s non-standard measures have increased
the risks to the central bank’s balance sheet and that the
separation between fiscal and monetary policy must be
maintained.  To contact the reporter on this story:
