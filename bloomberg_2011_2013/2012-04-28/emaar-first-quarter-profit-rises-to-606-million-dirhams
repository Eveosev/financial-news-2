Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , the builder
of the world’s tallest tower, said first-quarter profit rose 44
percent on increased sales of properties in Dubai, delivery of
homes in  Egypt , and strong revenue from malls and hotels.  Net income  climbed to 606 million dirhams ($165 million) or
10 fils a share, from 421 million dirhams, or 7 fils, a year
earlier, the Dubai-based company said in an e-mailed statement
today. The mean estimate of four analysts was for a profit of
566 million dirhams, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Emaar, owner of the world’s largest mall, is increasingly
relying on income from hotels and retail as revenue from
residential sales declines. The developer plans to add 1 million
square feet (92,903 square meters) of space to the Dubai Mall,
to boost recurring income.  “We have entered a new era of growth for Emaar, focused on
identifying new growth opportunities in line with the fast-
changing economic environment,” Chairman Mohammed Alabbar said
in the statement. “The expansion that we have announced to the
Dubai Mall and our hospitality business are all geared to
generate long-term value creation for our stakeholders.”  New unit sales in Dubai rose to more than 620 million
dirhams in the first quarter, the company said. Revenue in the
three months to March 31 fell 8 percent to 1.82 billion dirhams,
with shopping malls and retail businesses contributing 651
million dirhams, and hospitality and leisure businesses
contributing 403 million in the first quarter, it said. “The
revenues from business segments of malls and hospitality in this
quarter increased by 25 percent as compared to the same period
in 2011 and accounted for 58 percent of the company’s total
revenue,” it said.  Burj Khalifa  Like most of its peers in the  United Arab Emirates , Emaar
saw earnings drop after Dubai’s property market collapsed at the
end of 2008 and caused residential values to drop by 60 percent
or more. Revenue from selling properties in the 818-meter
(2,684-foot) Burj Khalifa has dwindled as buyers paid their
final instalments on completed apartments.  Emaar handed over 158 residential units in the first
quarter, comprising 117 units in Dubai and 41 units in
international markets, today’s statement said. The company also
delivered 180,000 square feet of commercial space in the same
period. Emaar said it plans new projects this year to
“energize” its domestic operations, according to the
statement.  Emaar  shares  dropped 0.9 percent to 3.25 dirhams on April
26, the last day of trading before the weekend. The stock has
gained 26 percent this year, giving the company a market value
of 19.8 billion dirhams.  To contact the reporters on this story:
