Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G)  needs
new management who can focus on the insurers’ core business and
avoid financial investments,  Luxottica Group SpA (LUX)  founder and
Generali investor Leonardo Del Vecchio told Corriere della Sera
in an interview.  “As an investor I think that Generali, one of Italy’s
jewels, needs a change,” Corriere cited Del Vecchio as saying.
“What annoys me is that while the company’s fundamentals are
good and the insuring activity works, the manager’s will to do
financial investments spoils it all.”  In the interview, Del Vecchio said Chief Executive Officer
Giovanni Perissinotto “should resign.”  Del Vecchio quit as a Generali director Feb. 21, saying he
wasn’t able to influence strategy at the insurer. He owns 3
percent of Generali.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
