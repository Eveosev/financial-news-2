OAO  Mechel (MTLR) ,  Russia ’s largest
producer of coal for steelmakers, agreed to pay a fee of 50 to
65 basis points to lenders agreeing to new covenants on the
company’s debt, DebtWire reported, citing people it didn’t
identify.  Banks on Mechel’s $2 billion syndicated loan, led by  BNP
Paribas SA (BNP) ,  ING Groep NV (INGA)  and  UniCredit SpA (UCG) , agreed to cap
Mechel’s ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization at 5.5 this year, 4.4 in 2013 and
3.75 in the first half of 2014, DebtWire said April 26. The
lenders agreed to an interest coverage ratio of at least 2.65
this year, 3.5 for 2013 and 4 for the first half of 2014,
DebtWire said.  Mechel will pay 50 basis points to lenders that sign up for
the revised covenants as well as an “early-bird fee” of 15
basis points for lenders who agreed by mid-April, according to
the report.  The company has received waivers on debt from more than 25
international banks, it said yesterday without disclosing the
revised terms. Ekaterina Videman, a spokeswoman for Mechel in
Moscow declined to comment late yesterday on the DebtWire
report.  “Systematic deleveraging as a whole, and reduction of
short-term debt in particular,” is a priority for the company,
Chief Financial Officer Stanislav Ploschenko said in a statement
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
