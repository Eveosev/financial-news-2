Derek Jeter  scored on catcher Alex Avila’s passed ball in the bottom of the ninth inning to give
the  New York Yankees  a 7-6 win over the  Detroit  Tigers in a
Major League Baseball contest.  Jeter, whose 15-game hitting streak ended, reached first on
a walk, went to second on Curtis Granderson’s walk and advanced
to third on a wild pitch by Brayan Villarreal at Yankee Stadium.
When a pitch to  Alex Rodriguez  caromed off Avila’s glove,
Rodriguez began waving for Jeter to head home.  “I’m at third. When Aviles turns around, I couldn’t see
it,” Jeter told reporters. “You really can’t see where the
ball is. I saw Alex.”  Rodriguez had a run-scoring single in the first inning,
followed by a solo home run in the fourth.  Russell Martin 
blasted a two-run homer in the fifth and  Nick Swisher  scored on
an error by Don Kelly in the sixth.  Mark Teixeira ’s sacrifice fly scored Rodriguez to tie the
game at 6-6 in the eighth before Jeter secured the win for the
Yankees (11-8).  Brad Eldred hit a run-scoring triple to tie the game at 1-1
in the second and Miguel Cabrera got his 1,000th run batted in
when he and Prince Fielder each hit scoring singles in the third
as the Tigers (10-10) took a 3-1 lead.  Perfect Inning  Austin Jackson hit a two-run double and Fielder drove him
home in the sixth for Detroit, which had a 6-4 advantage.  Mariano Rivera  (1-1) pitched a perfect inning, striking out
one for the win. Villarreal (0-1) gave up one run in one-third
inning to take the loss.  At Coors Field in Denver, Scott Hairston became the 10th
member of the Mets (11-9) to hit for the cycle in  New York ’s 18-
9 loss to the Colorado Rockies. Hairston hit a single in the
second inning, a home run in the fourth, a triple in the fifth
and a double in the sixth.  Carlos Gonzalez  hit a home run and a single to account for
five of his six runs batted in during the Rockies (10-9) 11-run
fifth inning.  Matt Reynolds (3-0) allowed two hits in one inning for the
win, while Manny Acosta (0-1) surrendered seven runs on five
hits in one-third inning for the loss.  In other American League games, it was Oakland 5, Baltimore
2; Cleveland 3, the Los Angeles Angels 2; Seattle 9, Toronto 5
(10 innings); Tampa Bay 8, Texas 4; Kansas City 7, Minnesota 6;
and Boston 10, the Chicago White Sox 3.  In the National League, it was the Chicago Cubs 5,
Philadelphia 1; Houston 6, Cincinnati 4; Arizona 5, Miami 0;
Atlanta 6, Pittsburgh 1; the Los Angeles Dodgers 3, Washington
Nationals 2; San Diego 5, San Francisco 3; and St. Louis 13,
