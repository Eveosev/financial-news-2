Outfielder Bryce Harper, the top
pick in the 2010 draft, will make his Major League Baseball
debut today when the Washington Nationals travel to the  Los
Angeles Dodgers .  Harper, 19, will be joining Washington pitcher  Stephen Strasburg , the No. 1 selection in the 2009 draft, in the contest
between the National League East-leading Nationals (14-6) and
the West’s first-place Dodgers (14-6), to be televised by MLB
Network.  The Dodgers defeated the Nationals 3-2 last night in the
first game of their three-game series at Dodger Stadium. The
Nationals and Dodgers are tied atop the National League going
into today’s game.  Harper was batting .250 with one home run for Triple-A
Syracuse. He will replace third baseman  Ryan Zimmerman , who is
going on the 15-day disabled list, on the Nationals’ roster.  Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs managers Tony Beasley delivered
the news of Harper’s major league call-up to the player.  “He was stunned,” Beasley told MASN sports network. “I
don’t think he quite knew how to take the news. Bryce was kind
of at a loss for words. He kind of just took it all in. He was
very excited and humble.”  Beasley said he offered some advice to Harper about the
culture of playing major league ball.  “I tried to prepare him as best I could as to what he
might see, the things he would face at the top stage,” Beasley
said. “He will play hard and be competitive.”  Strasburg, 23, is 2-0 with a 1.08 earned run average,
fourth in the National league. In four starts, he has pitched 25
innings, allowing three runs on 17 hits and striking out 25,
while walking six.  Strasburg returned to the Nationals on Sept. 6 in a game
against the Dodgers after a year of rehabilitation that followed
elbow surgery. Strasburg set a major league record with 41
strikeouts in his first four starts in the 2010 season, going 5-
3 with a 2.92 earned run average and 92 strikeouts in 68
innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
