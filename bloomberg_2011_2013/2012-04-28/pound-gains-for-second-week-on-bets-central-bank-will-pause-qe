The pound strengthened for a second
week versus the dollar on speculation the central bank will
pause its stimulus program even after the nation slipped back
into recession.  Sterling climbed to a 22-month high against the euro as
investors sought the safety of the U.K. currency after  Standard
& Poor’s  downgraded  Spain ’s credit rating. The pound rose to the
highest since September versus the dollar after a U.S. report
showed growth in the world’s largest economy slowed last
quarter. Gilts completed a weekly gain.  “You look across most other countries and the sense is
that whilst the U.K. had a surprise with the gross domestic
product data, the general drift of data and monetary policy
sentiment has tended to be weaker elsewhere,” said  Steven Barrow , an analyst at Standard Bank Plc in London. “If the U.K.
stood out more in terms of weakness of the economy then perhaps
the pound would have suffered.”  The pound gained 0.8 percent this week to $1.6243 at 5:05
p.m. London time yesterday after rising to $1.6258, the highest
since Dec. 1. Sterling appreciated 0.5 percent to 81.59 pence
per euro. It reached 81.34 pence yesterday, the strongest level
since June 2010.  Bank of England  officials will consider whether to extend
their asset-purchase program when they meet on May 9-10. The
Monetary Policy Committee backed finishing the current 325
billion-pound quantitative-easing program when it last met on
April 4-5.  Slower Growth  The pound rose to a five-month high against the dollar
yesterday after the U.S. Commerce Department said GDP growth
cooled to 2.2 percent from 3 percent in the prior three months.  Britain’s economy unexpectedly shrank in the first three
months of the year according to data published April 25, pushing
the nation into its first  double-dip recession  since the 1970s.  The pound has appreciated 1.6 percent over the past month,
the second-best performer after the yen among the 10 developed-
nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes. The dollar dropped 0.4 percent.  The 10-year gilt yield fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, this week to 2.13 percent. The 4 percent bond
due in March 2022 gained 0.465, or 4.65 pounds per 1,000-pound
face amount, to 116.59.  The Debt Management Office plans to auction as much as 3.75
billion pounds of seven-year notes on May 1, and inflation-
linked securities due March 2034 on May 3. The government will
sell as much as 3 billion pounds of bills on May 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
