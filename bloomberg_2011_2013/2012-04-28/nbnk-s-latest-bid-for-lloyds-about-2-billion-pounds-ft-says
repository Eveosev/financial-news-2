Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  received a
2 billion pound ($3.3 billion) bid from  NBNK Investments Plc. (NBNK) 
for some of its branches, which would include cash or new shares
for the mortgage lender’s investors, the Financial Times
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Lloyd’s spurned NBNK’s 1.5 billion-pound offer to buy the
branches last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
