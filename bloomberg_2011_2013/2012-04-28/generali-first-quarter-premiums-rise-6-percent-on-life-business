Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G) , Italy’s
largest insurer, said first-quarter gross premiums rose 6.1
percent on a like-for-like basis, boosted by  life insurance .  Total premiums increased to 19.8 billion euros ($26.3
billion) in the three months through March, from 19.1 billion
euros in the first quarter of 2011, Chief Executive Officer
Giovanni Perissinotto told a  shareholders’ meeting  today in
Trieste. Life premiums rose by 6.9 percent while non-life
premiums rose by 4.7 percent in the period, he said.  “We had a positive start to the year and we will try to
improve further in the coming months,” Perissinotto said.  The company, scheduled to release results on May 11, said
in March it expects “strong” profit growth this year. “If the
market is less negative than last year, net income in 2012
should be in the range of 1.5 to 1.8 billion euros,”
Perissinotto said separately in an interview with Trieste-based
newspaper  Il Piccolo  published today.  The insurer is expanding in  emerging markets  and eastern
Europe to boost earnings following the financial crisis, while
cutting costs, improving efficiency and selling assets to
strengthen capital.  To contact the reporters on this story:
