European Monetary Affairs
Commissioner  Olli Rehn  didn’t intervene to force the European
Investment Bank to remove clauses in loans compelling Greek
companies to renegotiate debt if Greece reverts to the drachma,
the European Commission said.  The Kathimerini newspaper yesterday reported that Rehn
called EIB President Werner Hoyer over the issue.  “Rehn has been misquoted,” spokeswoman Chantal Hughes
said in an email yesterday. “In his discussions with EIB
President Hoyer, Vice-President Rehn has been informed that the
EIB is following normal banking practices and that the issue
referred to in the press is settled.”  Kathimerini, based in Athens, had quoted Rehn saying the
clauses were “unfortunate and incomprehensible,” without
saying how it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
