LeBron James scored 32 points as
the  Miami Heat  defeated the New York Knicks 100-67 in the first
game of their best-of-seven National Basketball Association
playoff series.  In other games yesterday, the Oklahoma City Thunder topped
the Dallas Mavericks 99-98, the Chicago Bulls beat the
Philadelphia 76ers 103-91 and the Orlando Magic defeated the
Indiana Pacers 81-77.  At AmericanAirlines Arena in Miami, James hit 10-of-14
field goal attempts and 11-of-14 free throws, while Dwyane Wade
added 19 for the Heat, who have a 1-0 advantage in their Eastern
Conference series.  “I’m a different player this year, a different person this
year compared to last year,” James told reporters. “I’ve
waited to get back to the postseason, prepared myself all
season, throughout the offseason, to get back to this point.”  The Heat had a 32-2 run that straddled halftime when Miami
went to the locker room with a 54-31 lead before a home crowd.
Miami also capitalized on 27 Knicks’ turnovers, converting them
into 38 points.  “Our guys had a noticeable look in their eyes the last 24
hours,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “We wanted to get back
to the basics and play to our identity. For the most part, we
were able to do that by being aggressive.”  ‘Series Not Over’  J.R. Smith came off the bench to score 17 points and
Carmelo Anthony had 10 for the Knicks, who recorded their worst
playoff loss since April 25, 1991, when they lost 126-85 to the
 Chicago Bulls . The Knicks will seek to tie the series at 1-1
tomorrow when they meet the Heat for Game 2.  “This series is not over,” Amar’e Stoudemire told
reporters. “We’ve got to learn from our mistakes today and get
ready for Monday.”  Rookie guard Iman Shumpert tore his anterior cruciate
ligament and the lateral meniscus when he twisted his knee in
the third quarter. The injuries will require surgery followed by
rehabilitation of six to eight months.  At Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City,  Kevin Durant 
hit a 15-foot jumper at the buzzer, nine seconds after Dirk Nowitzki had put the Mavericks ahead 98-97 on two free throws.  Russell Westbrook  had 28 points, Durant contributed 25 and
Serge Ibaka scored 22 points for the Thunder, who trailed 51-48
at halftime.  Nowitzki was high-scorer for the Mavericks with 25 points
and  Jason Terry  added 20.  The second-seeded Thunder hosts Game 2 against the
Mavericks tomorrow.  At Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Jason Richardson and Jameer Nelson each scored 17 points for the
Magic. David West led the Pacers with 19 points.  The teams meet tomorrow for Game 2 of the Western
Conference matchup.  Knee Injury  At the United Center in  Chicago ,  Derrick Rose  scored 23
points for the Bulls before leaving with a season-ending knee
injury.  Rose also had nine rebounds and nine assists as the Bulls,
the top seed in the Eastern Conference, never trailed after
taking a 4-3 lead. Richard Hamilton added 19 points, Luol Deng
scored 17 and Joakim Noah had 12 points and 13 rebounds.  Elton Brand scored 19 points to lead eighth-seeded
Philadelphia.  Chicago hosts Game 2 in the best-of-seven, first-round
series on May 1.  In today’s series-openers, the Utah Jazz travel to the
Western Conference top-seeded San Antonio Spurs; the  Denver
Nuggets  visit the  Los Angeles Lakers ; the Atlanta Hawks host the
 Boston Celtics ; and the  Memphis Grizzlies  are home against the
 Los Angeles Clippers .  To contact the reporter on this story:
