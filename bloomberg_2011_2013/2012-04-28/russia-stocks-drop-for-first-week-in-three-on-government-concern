Russian stocks declined for the
first week in three on concern President-elect  Vladimir Putin ’s
new government won’t undertake changes necessary to reform the
economy amid signs the global recovery is slowing.  The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  added 0.3 percent to 1,473.50 by
the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, paring its steepest weekly drop
in a month to 2.1 percent.  OAO  Mechel (MTLR) , Russia’s biggest producer of coal for
steelmakers, lost 0.1 percent, while OAO EON Russia, the Moscow
unit of  Germany ’s biggest utility, traded down 0.2 percent. OAO
Aeroflot, the country’s largest airline, gained 4.1 percent, the
most since Dec. 30. The dollar-denominated RTS Index was little
changed at 1,593.97. Markets are open today to replace the April
30 public holiday.  Russia’s new government lineup is due to be announced after
Putin’s inauguration on May 7. The former KGB officer, who was
president from 2000 to 2008 before having to step down because
of  term limits , pledged during his campaign to boost pensions
and support for small business. Emerging-market stock funds
posted their third consecutive week of outflows on concern the
European debt crisis may worsen, according to EPFR Global.  “Everyone is looking for some kind of a game plan from the
new government,”  Roland Nash , chief investment strategist at
Verno Capital in Moscow, who helps manage $200 million in
Russian equities, said by phone today. “There is a lot of
uncertainty right now and the markets tend to hate
uncertainty.”  Putin, who won his third term as president on March 4, has
backtracked on a promise by current President  Dmitry Medvedev  --
whom he asked to be his premier -- to return to direct elections
for governors, saying on April 11 that he will retain the right
to veto candidates.  Euro Confidence, U.S. Jobs  Urals crude , the country’s main export earner, rose 0.2
percent to $117.36 yesterday, gaining 1.5 percent from last
week, the first weekly advance in seven.  Oil may decline next week after economic confidence in the
euro region fell and more Americans than estimated filed
applications for  unemployment benefits , a Bloomberg survey
showed. Sixteen of 37 analysts, or 43 percent, forecast oil will
retreat through May 4.  Russia ’s budget relies on oil and gas for
about 50 percent of its revenue.  Under an Economy Ministry development proposal submitted to
the government for approval, the oil and gas industry would make
up about 10 percent of the country’s gross domestic product by
2030, from 20 percent currently.  Putin vowed to boost pensions and salaries for state
workers and the military during campaigning, pledges that will
contribute to a 4.8 trillion-ruble ($164 billion) increase in
spending through 2018, according to Capital Economics Ltd. He
also vowed to reverse “repressive” state policies and reduce
government holdings in major non-commodity companies.  ‘Unsteady’  “We don’t know what reforms they are going to implement,
what the new cabinet is going to look like,” Nash said. “Until
we have an understanding what the new government is going to do,
the market will remain unsteady.”  The Micex will be open for trading on May 7 and 8 and
closed on April 30, May 1 and 9 due to public holidays.  Russian shares have fallen 2.9 percent so far this month
and trade at 5.4 times estimated earnings. That compares with a
2.1 percent loss for the  MSCI Emerging-Market Index (MXEF)  which trades
at 10 times projected earnings.  The Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, gained 0.5 percent to $29.89 in  New York 
yesterday, the highest level since April 20. Futures expiring in
June on the RTS Index added 0.2 percent to 155,225.  Mechel, Aeroflot, OGK-3  Mechel fell to 260.8 rubles. Trading volumes totalled
97,787, or 22 percent of the average three-month trading
activity for the shares. EON Russia declined to 2.655.  Aeroflot rallied 4.2 percent to 48.81 rubles, the biggest
daily gain since Dec. 30. The company boosted  passenger  numbers
by 29 percent to 3.6 million from January to March, compared
with a year earlier, Russia’s aviation authority reported
yesterday on its website. The stock’s trading volume totalled
3.85 million, equivalent to 169 percent of the three-month
average.  OAO OGK-3, the Russian electricity utility majority-owned
by OAO Inter RAO UES, fell 1.3 percent to 1.057 rubles, the
lowest closing level since Feb. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
