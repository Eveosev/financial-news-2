The Belgian government agreed that
Karel De Boeck, 62, will succeed Pierre Mariani as chief
executive officer of  Dexia SA (DEXB) ,  De Morgen  reported, without
saying where it got the information.  De Boeck, a Belgian banker who led Fortis for seven months
after its collapse in 2008, will get a term of two to three
years at the helm of Dexia, the newspaper said today. He will be
nominated as a board member next week, pending his appointment
as chief executive officer, according to  De Morgen .  To contact the reporter on this story:
