Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ,  Europe ’s
second-largest phone company, agreed to raise wages for 17,000
of its employees by 6.5 percent over two years, saying the deal
hurt its bid to contain costs.  The Bonn-based company and the Ver.di union accepted a
proposal by a mediator, former Hamburg mayor Henning Voscherau,
to lift wages in three stages through Jan. 31, 2014, the two
parties said in separate e-mailed statements. The agreement does
not concern separate wage talks for Deutsche Telekom’s German
unit and the T-Systems corporate-client division.  The result represents a compromise between union demands
for a 6.5 percent raise over just 12 months, and Chief Executive
Officer  Rene Obermann ’s insistence that  Germany ’s former phone
monopoly can’t afford to increase worker pay at all. Deutsche
Telekom said complying with all the union’s demands for 85,000
employees would cost an additional 500 million euros ($663
million) per year.  “The multi-day mediation talks were a tough piece of work
given the entirely outsized wage demands by Ver.di,” Deutsche
Telekom’s head of personnel Thomas Sattelberger said in a
statement. “The final results hurts us quite a bit, because it
doesn’t fit the economic reality of Telekom AG, but it’s
significantly below the original demand.”  Talks regarding T-Systems will continue on May 2, Deutsche
Telekom spokesman Christian Schwolow said. Negotiations
regarding about 50,000 employees at the German unit were broken
off last week and haven’t resumed yet, he said.  Deutsche Telekom’s  sales may fall  for a third year in 2012,
sliding 1.7 percent to 57.6 billion euros, according to analysts
in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
