The rising price of stamps will
force “millions” of U.K. residents to stop using the postal
service, the  Daily Telegraph  said, citing a  Royal Mail  memo sent
to members of parliament.  The government-owned Royal Mail anticipates a drop of 15
percent in second-class letters and 12 percent in first-class
mail when stamp prices rise on April 30, the newspaper reported.
The increased price could “spectacularly backfire” and do
“irrevocable damage” to the Royal Mail, Ian Murray, the shadow
postal affairs minister, said in an interview with the paper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
