The yen gained versus the dollar,
headed for its biggest monthly rally since July, as investors
speculated the  Federal Reserve  won’t be quick to abandon efforts
to support the  U.S. economy .  The euro fell versus most major peers this week after
 Standard & Poor’s  downgraded Spain, fueling bets  Europe ’s debt
crisis is spreading. The yen also rose amid concern new Bank of
Japan stimulus won’t be enough to spur growth. The dollar
dropped as 10-year Treasury yields slid for a sixth week,
damping the appeal of  U.S. debt  over Japanese bonds. U.S. jobs
growth remained below 200,000 in April, data next week may show.  “To a surprising degree, the yen has been very much
correlated with U.S. yields,” Steven Englander, head of Group
of 10 currency strategy at Citigroup Inc. in New York, said
yesterday. “There was also a bit of disappointment in the  Bank
of Japan .”  The yen strengthened 1.6 percent to 80.27 per dollar
yesterday in New York, from 81.52 a week earlier. It reached
80.22, the strongest level since Feb. 28. The Japanese currency
has gained 3.2 percent in April, the most since a 5 percent rise
in July. The yen advanced 1.3 percent to 106.40 per euro. The
17-nation currency rose 0.3 percent to $1.3255.  U.S. 10-year note  yields  fell three basis points over the
past five days, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.94 percent. They
last ended a stretch of six weekly losses in June.  ‘Fairly Disappointing’  The BOJ said April 26 it will boost its asset-purchase fund
to 40 trillion yen ($498 billion) by June 2013, compared with
the previous target of 30 trillion yen by year-end. A separate
central-bank program providing funds to banks was pared by 5
trillion yen amid lackluster demand for loans. Economists had
expected an increase of as much 10 trillion yen to the nation’s
stimulus program.  The central bank’s move “was fairly disappointing, so the
temptation to sell the yen was weakened,”  Sebastien Galy , a
senior foreign-exchange strategist at Societe Generale SA in  New
York  said yesterday.  The yen rose 3.5 percent over the past month versus nine
developed-nation counterparts monitored by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes, the best performer. The dollar
declined 0.5 percent, and the euro fell 1 percent. The pound
advanced 1.7 percent.  The Dollar Index fell for a second week as the Fed repeated
a plan to keep its key  interest rate  “exceptionally low” through
at least late 2014 and a government report showed America’s
economy expanded in the first quarter less than forecast.  Growth Slows  U.S. gross domestic product grew at a 2.2 percent annual
rate, Commerce Department data showed yesterday. That followed a
3 percent pace from October through December and compared with a
2.5 percent median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  While the Fed refrained at a two-day meeting this week from
new actions to boost the economy, Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
the central bank is “prepared to do more” if necessary.  U.S. payrolls added 165,000 jobs in April, economists in a
Bloomberg survey forecast before Labor Department data due May
4. The March report showed 120,000 new jobs, versus a forecast
of 205,000. It was the first time in four months the number was
below 223,000.  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, dropped 0.6 percent to 78.709.  Hedge funds  and other large speculators decreased bets the
euro will fall against the dollar.  Net short positions  in the
shared currency fell to 113,367 contracts in the week ended
April 24, from 118,125 the previous week, according to Commodity
Futures Trading Commission data.  Rand, Peso  Higher-yielding currencies including  South Africa ’s rand
and  Mexico ’s peso climbed against the greenback this week as
risk appetite increased. The rand gained 0.9 percent to 7.7445
per dollar, and the peso gained 1 percent to 12.9678. Interest
rates in the two nations are 5.5 percent and 4.5 percent,
compared with virtually zero in the U.S. and  Japan .  The  implied volatility  of three-month options for Group of
Seven currencies closed yesterday at 8.87 percent, the lowest
level since 2007, according to the JPMorgan Volatility Index.
Lower volatility makes investments in currencies of nations with
higher benchmark rates more attractive because the risk in such
trades is that market moves will erase profits.  The euro slid as political turmoil fanned concern the debt
crisis will worsen.  Francois Hollande , the leading candidate to
become  France ’s next president, said the country won’t ratify
Europe’s fiscal pact in its current form if he’s elected.  ‘Hostile Dynamic’  “It’s the fact that you’ve got someone in France who is not
aligned with  Germany , and what it means is you’re going to see
more of a hostile dynamic between Germany and France, rather
than a cooperative one,”  Richard Franulovich , a senior currency
strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in New York said April 23.  S&P cut  Spain ’s long-term credit rating by two steps to
BBB+ from A on April 26, saying the outlook is negative as the
recession undermines efforts to trim the nation’s budget gap.  Sterling rallied versus 13 of its 16 most-traded peers this
week even as a government report on April 25 showed the U.K.
slipped back into recession. The currency reached an eight-month
high against the dollar, touching $1.6281, and climbed to a 22-
month high versus the euro, 81.34 pence.  U.K. consumer confidence climbed last month more than
economists estimated, data showed. A Nationwide Building Society
index of sentiment rising to 53, from 44 the previous month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
