Russia ’s Natural Resources Ministry
urged fertilizer maker OAO Acron to change the planned
transportation route for its phosphate project in the Murmansk
region to bypass a nature reserve being created in the area.  The government plans to set up the Khibiny nature park in
northwest Russia near Acron’s Partomchorr phosphate deposit, the
ministry said on its  website .  Acron is in touch with state officials and will consider
alternative routes, company spokeswoman Elena Kochubey said by
telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
