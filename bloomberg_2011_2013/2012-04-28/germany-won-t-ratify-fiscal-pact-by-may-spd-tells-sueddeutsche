Germany  won’t be able to ratify the
European fiscal pact by the end of May,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung 
reported, citing Frank-Walter Steinmeier from the opposition
Social Democratic Party.  Chancellor Angela Merkel must first negotiate with
opposition parties to obtain a two-third majority in parliament,
he was cited as saying. The opposition demands measures such as
a taxation of financial-market transactions and a program to
stimulate growth in weaker European economies, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
