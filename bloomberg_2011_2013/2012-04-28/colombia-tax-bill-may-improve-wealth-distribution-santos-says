Colombia will send a tax bill to
Congress in the next few days that will seek to improve wealth
distribution, President  Juan Manuel Santos  said.  “We have sufficient funds, we don’t need more funds,”
Santos said yesterday, according to a  statement  on the
presidential website. “Our tax system doesn’t help to improve
wealth distribution and what we want is for our system to be
fair.”  The government will propose keeping in place a  wealth tax ,
and is reviewing taxes on foodstuffs and some capital gains
taxes, Congressman Angel Cabrera, a member of a congressional
finance committee, said April 19 after a meeting with Finance
Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry. Colombia’s central government
budget deficit this year may be 2.4 percent of gross domestic
product, below the 2.6 percent target, Echeverry told reporters
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
