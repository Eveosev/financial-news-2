  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  is hoping to
predict more accurately how much money “The Avengers” will
bring in when it debuts next week by analyzing social networking
sites such as Twitter, the Financial Times reported.  The sites have made it easier to gauge public sentiment,
making Hollywood research firm  Fizziology  forecast that the
superhero film will probably generate $135 million to $150
million in its opening weekend, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
