Bulgaria’s grain harvest will fall
13 percent this year to 6.17 million metric tons, according to
agricultural researcher UkrAgroConsult.  Corn may be the only crop that will increase this year, the
Kiev, Ukraine-based company said in an e-mailed statement today.
Barley and rapeseed supply were damaged by severe frosts, the
researcher said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
