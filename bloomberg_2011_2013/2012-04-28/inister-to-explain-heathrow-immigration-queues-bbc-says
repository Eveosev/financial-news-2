U.K.’s immigration minister Damian Green will appear before the Home Affairs Selection Committee to
explain lengthy queues at  London ’s Heathrow airport, the  BBC 
reported, citing committee chairman Keith Vaz.  “It’s not just about the Olympics, it’s about Heathrow as
a world class airport,” Vaz said in an interview on  BBC ’s Radio
4. “It’s a choice for the government -- either you look at the
way in which you deal with people when they arrive at Heathrow
or you recruit more staff.” The BBC did not specify a date for
Green’s appearance before the committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
