German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
said European Union leaders will discuss plans to bolster
economic growth in the 27-nation bloc at their June summit.  The EU may consider strengthening the  European Investment
Bank  as part of their plans, Merkel was cited as saying in an
interview with the Leipziger Volkszeitung newspaper published
today. Countries can already use EU structural funds more
flexibly to help small and mid-sized businesses, she said.  Merkel rejected providing new government stimulus to foster
growth, saying that policies must focus on creating jobs and
improving competitiveness, according to the newspaper.  She also ruled out reopening negotiations on the fiscal
pact signed by 25 EU leaders as sought by French Socialist
presidential candidate  Francois Hollande .  “There won’t be any new negotiations on the fiscal pact,”
she said. At the same time, “political responsibility” means
she will work well with every French president, the newspaper
cited her as saying.  To contact the reporters on this story:
