Alisher Usmanov’s  Mail.ru Group
Ltd. (MAIL)  may transfer voting rights on its shares in the VKontakte
social network to founder Pavel Durov to end a feud with him,
the Russian billionaire said on Rossiya-24 state television.  Mail.ru owns about 40 percent of VKontakte, so giving its
voting rights to Durov, who owns about 12 percent, would give
Durov control of the company, the Vedomosti newspaper reported
today. Usmanov was involved in a similar deal when buying a
stake in  Facebook Inc. (FB)  in 2009, giving voting rights of those
shares to founder  Mark Zuckerberg , the newspaper said.  Mail.Ru previously sought to increase its VKontakte stake
to more than 50 percent, a plan Durov opposed because he wanted
the company to remain independent and pursue an initial public
offering, the Moscow-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
