Hedge fund managers including  John Paulson  are betting against bonds issued by France, Germany and
the Netherlands, signaling  Europe ’s financial woes will worsen
in the next few months, the Financial Times reported.  Paulson privately warned his investors two weeks ago that
Europe’s financial crisis will probably deepen, the FT said.  Bets against those countries demonstrates a new level of
bearishness because it suggests the “core” of Europe is
mispriced, even though much of the region’s troubles are on the
fringes in countries such as Spain and Greece, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
