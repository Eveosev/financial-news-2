The ruble weakened against Bank
Rossii’s target dollar-euro basket amid speculation the central
bank was buying other currencies to slow its gains. Local bond
yields rose.  The  ruble  dropped 0.4 percent to 33.7368 against the basket
by the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, a fourth day of losses. Russia’s
140 billion rubles ($4.8 billion) of domestic OFZ bonds due
August 2016 fell for a second day, increasing the yield one
basis point to 7.39 percent.  Bank Rossii manages the ruble within a so-called “floating
corridor” against a basket of dollars and euros to limit swings
that erode exporters’ competitiveness. The current level against
the basket implies the bank may be buying about $240 million a
day in other currencies against the ruble, said Sergey Fishgoyt,
deputy head of foreign exchange at Otkritie Bank in Moscow.  “There’s no European trading today, but the central bank
is still buying at these levels,” he said by e-mail.  Russia’s markets are open today to replace the April 30
public holiday. The ruble lost 0.3 percent to 29.41 a dollar and
depreciated 0.4 percent to 39.025 a euro.  “It’s very quiet today, no flows, no ideas, no moves,”
Igor Akinshin, a currency trader at  Alfa Bank  in Moscow, said by
e-mail. “It’s like the market is frozen.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
