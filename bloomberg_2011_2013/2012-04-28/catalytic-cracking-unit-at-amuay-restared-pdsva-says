Petroleos de Venezuela SA , the
state oil company, restarted the catalytic cracking unit at the
Amuay refinery in Falcon state following maintenance work that
began in February, the company said today in an e-mailed
statement.  The company also restarted treatment plants connected to
the unit, which processes 108,000 barrels of oil a day and
64,000 barrels a day of gasoline, according to the statement.  A catalytic unit at Amuay refinery broke down after
attempts to restart an air compressor following programmed
maintenance, Caracas-based newspaper El Universal reported April
26, citing union leader Ivan Freites.  That unit may remain paralyzed for at least two months
while the compressor is repaired, El Universal cited Freites as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
