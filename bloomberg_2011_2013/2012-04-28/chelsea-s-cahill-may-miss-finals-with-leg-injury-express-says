Chelsea defender  Gary Cahill  may
miss the F.A. Cup and Champions League finals because of a
hamstring injury, the Daily Express said.  Cahill was hurt in Chelsea’s Champions League semifinal win
over Barcelona four days ago. The normal recovery time for the
injury is four weeeks, leaving him in doubt for next weekend’s
F.A. Cup final against Liverpool and the Champions League final
against  Bayern Munich  on May 19, the Express said.  “We hope and we will try to get Gary back fit as soon as
possible,” Chelsea interim manager Roberto Di Matteo said.
“But at the moment it’s difficult to put a date on it.”  Chelsea’s defense will be without the suspended John Terry
and Branislav Ivanovic in the Champions League final.  David Luiz 
is also just returning from two weeks out with a hamstring
injury.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
