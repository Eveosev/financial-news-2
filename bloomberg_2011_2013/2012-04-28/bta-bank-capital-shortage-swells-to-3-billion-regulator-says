BTA Bank (BTA) , the biggest Kazakh lender
before defaulting on $12 billion of debt in 2009, saw its
capital shortage swell 13 percent last month amid plans to
restructure for the second time in as many years.  The lender’s liabilities exceeded assets by 435 billion
tenge ($3 billion) as of April 1, compared with a gap of 385
billion tenge a month earlier, the Kazakh central bank’s
financial oversight committee said in a monthly report on its
 website . BTA’s assets shrank to 1.437 trillion tenge in March
from 1.476 trillion tenge in February, the regulator said.  BTA is negotiating its second debt restructuring after
failing to make an interest payment on its July 2018 dollar
bonds in January. The bank halted all payments on $5.2 billion
of its recovery units, which BTA creditors received as part of a
restructuring accord in 2010 to get 50 percent of anything the
lender can get from impaired assets.  The following table shows the one-month performance of
 Kazakhstan ’s five largest lenders by assets, along with seventh-
ranked Alliance Bank and 13th-ranked Temirbank, and their
position as of April 1. The data from the oversight committee
are in billions of tenge:  To contact the reporter on this story:
