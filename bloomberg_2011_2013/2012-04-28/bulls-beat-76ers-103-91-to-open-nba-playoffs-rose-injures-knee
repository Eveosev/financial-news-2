Derrick Rose  scored 23 points
before leaving with a knee injury as the  Chicago Bulls  beat the
Philadelphia 76ers 103-91 in the opening game of the National
Basketball Association playoffs.  Rose, the NBA’s reigning Most Valuable Player, will miss
the rest of the season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament in
his left knee, the  Associated Press  reported.  Rose was hurt with 70 seconds remaining at the United
Center as he jumped to a stop after driving into the lane. He
lay on the court for several minutes while being treated by team
medical personnel before being helped to the locker room.  The extent of Rose’s injury was determined by an MRI exam,
Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau said in his postgame news conference.  Rose also had nine rebounds and nine assists as the Bulls,
the top seed in the Eastern Conference, never trailed after
taking a 4-3 lead. Richard Hamilton added 19 points,  Luol Deng 
scored 17 and Joakim Noah had 12 points and 13 rebounds.  Elton Brand scored 19 points to lead eighth-seeded
Philadelphia. Chicago hosts Game 2 in the best-of-seven, first-
round series on May 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
