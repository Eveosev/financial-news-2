Seven out of 10 people who
supported the Liberal Democrats in the 2010 election say the
party has abandoned too many of its principles since joining
forces with the Conservatives, a survey of voters has found.  More than half of those who voted for Deputy Prime Minister
 Nick Clegg ’s party say it has almost no influence on government
policy, while only two in five say they would vote for the
Liberal Democrats again, according to a survey by ComRes on
behalf of The Independent newspaper.  Most voters, at 56 percent, think the coalition government
is incompetent, compared with 27 percent who disagree. According
to the survey, 67 percent say Prime Minister  David Cameron  and
Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne are out of touch with
ordinary people.  The poll gives the Labour party a five-point lead over the
Tories at 39 percent versus 34 percent while the Liberal
Democrats were at 10 percent. Still, Labour leader  Ed Miliband 
is the least liked of the three leaders. While 45 percent say
they like the party, only 21 percent like its leader. Among
Labour supporters, 54 percent said they like the party and
dislike Miliband.  ComRes, a member of the British Polling Council,
interviewed 2,015 Britons between April 25 and April 27. The
results were weighted to be demographically representative.  To contact the reporter on this story:
