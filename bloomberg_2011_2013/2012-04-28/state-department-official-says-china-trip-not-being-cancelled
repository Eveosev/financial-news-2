Next week’s trip to  China  by U.S.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Treasury Secretary
 Timothy F. Geithner  won’t be cancelled because of the reported
U.S. protection given a Chinese activist, according to a State
Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity.  Blind legal activist Chen Guangcheng escaped house arrest
in eastern China and is under U.S. protection, and high-level
talks are taking place between the U.S. and China about his
status, according to a U.S.-based human rights group. The U.S.
Treasury Department referred all questions to the State
Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
