Unipec  Asia  Company Ltd., a
subsidiary of China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., sued  BNP Paribas
SA (BNP)  in Hong Kong to recover $46.6 million from the French bank.  Unipec Asia’s suit alleges that BNP Paribas breached a
stand-by letter of credit, according to a complaint filed April
26 in Hong Kong’s High Court. The oil company can also pursue
damages in relation to the breach of contract, according to the
filing.  Julia Boyce, Paris-based spokeswoman for BNP Paribas,
declined to comment when contacted by phone yesterday.  Huang Wensheng, the Beijing-based spokesman for Hong Kong-
listed China Petroleum, Unipec Asia’s parent company known as
Sinopec, didn’t answer four calls made to his office and mobile
telephone after working hours.  China Petroleum (386)  owns  Unipec Asia  through its oil-trading
unit China International United Petroleum & Chemicals Co., also
known as Unipec.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
