A 500-pound (227-kilogram) bomb
discovered near the Irish border last night may have been meant
to kill police, Press Association reported, citing  Northern
Ireland ’s Regional Development Minister Danny Kennedy.  The size of the device suggested dissident Irish
republicans may have planned a “major attack,” Kennedy, an
Ulster Unionist Party member, told the news service today. The
police also discovered a smaller bomb under a car in the
Ballygomartin area of north  Belfast , Press Association said,
citing Chief Inspector Ian Campbell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
