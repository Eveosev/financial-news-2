Repsol YPF SA (REP)  canceled a liquefied
natural gas shipment to  Argentina  that was to be delivered on
May 14, Clarin  reported , citing the Spanish company.  The shipment is one of 10 deliveries this year that had
been agreed upon in December with Argentina’s state-owned energy
company Energia Argentina SA. Repsol hasn’t said if it will
deliver the remaining cargoes, according to the newspaper.  The move follows Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner’s April 16 announcement of the takeover of an oil
company that was majority owned by Spain’s Repsol YPF.  To contact the reporter on this story:
