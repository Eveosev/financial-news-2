Arabtec Holding Co. (ARTC) , the biggest
builder in the  United Arab Emirates  by market value, doesn’t
expect any management changes after Abu Dhabi’s state-owned
Aabar Investments PJSC’s raised its shareholding.  Whether the Aabar stake is “10 percent or 20 or 40 or 50
it’s the same for us,” Chief Executive Officer Riad Kamal told
reporters at Arabtec’s shareholder meeting in Dubai today. “It
represents strong support for the company and shows Aabar’s
interest as a government entity in strengthening our company and
giving it opportunities.”  Aabar  boosted its ownership  in the Dubai builder to more
than 10 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Shareholders at the meeting approved Arabtec’s new board that
includes members from Aabar, which dropped a $1.74 billion offer
for Arabtec two years ago.  Kamal said he expects to see more contracts in  Abu Dhabi  as
a result of the Aabar stake.  Arabtec has enough operational capital and doesn’t need to
raise loans, the CEO said. “There is no need for further
financing now.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
