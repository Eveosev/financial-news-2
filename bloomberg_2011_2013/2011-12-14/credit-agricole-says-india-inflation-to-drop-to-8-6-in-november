Dariusz Kowalczyk, a senior
strategist at  Credit Agricole  CIB in  Hong Kong , comments on the
outlook for Indian inflation, monetary policy and the rupee in a
report published today.  India ’s wholesale prices rose 9.02 percent in November,
according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg before data due today. The  Reserve Bank  of India will
review borrowing costs on Dec. 16.  The rupee fell 0.7 percent yesterday to 53.2250 per dollar,
touching a record low of 53.52. It has slid 16 percent this year.  “Inflation data will be the highlight of the day. We
expect a drop to 8.6 percent year-on-year from 9.7 percent, much
deeper than consensus calls. Such a drop would be significant,
and would take inflation to a one-year low. It may stoke
speculation that the RBI will cut rates on Friday, putting
downward pressure on the rupee.  “However, we think the RBI will pause, because the other
options are not viable. First, inflation remains too much above
target so cutting rates would fuel inflation expectations --
it’s too early for that. Second, the rupee would come under
further pressure due to deterioration of interest-rate
differentials and doubts over central bank resolve to fight
inflation if they cut too soon. And a weaker rupee would add to
imported inflation. The lack of a rate cut could in itself
provide some support for the rupee as some in the market may be
betting on one.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
