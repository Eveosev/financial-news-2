Yields  on  Japan ’s 10-year government
bonds may rise to a seven-month high of 1.2 percent by March
after forming an “island” pattern, according to Sumitomo
Mitsui Banking Corp.  The so-called island reversal pattern is an isolated
trading period on a candlestick chart that’s created by a gap on
both sides of a trading range. The pattern, which signals a
reversal of the current trend, was formed from Nov. 28 to Dec.
8, according to Daisuke Uno, chief strategist in  Tokyo  at the
unit of Japan’s second-largest bank by market value.  “Since an island was formed, we should understand that to
mean the period of declining yields is over,” Uno said, citing
the daily candlestick chart. “Even though the rates dropped to
around 1 percent yesterday, they may start rising again.”  Ten-year yields have fallen since climbing to a four-month
high of 1.09 percent on Dec. 1. Yields reached 0.94 percent on
Nov. 17, the least in a year.  The 10-year rate may rise to about 1.2 percent, the highest
level since May 2, Uno said.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
