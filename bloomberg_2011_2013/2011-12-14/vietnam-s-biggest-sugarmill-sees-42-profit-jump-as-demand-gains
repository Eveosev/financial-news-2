Societe de Bourbon Tay Ninh Joint-
Stock Co. (SBT) , Vietnam’s largest-listed sugar company, forecasts
profit will jump 42 percent this year amid rising consumption as
the company looks for expansion opportunities.  Net income will likely be 490 billion dong ($23.3 million)
this year, General Director Nguyen Ba Chu said yesterday. Profit
in 2010 was 345.2 billion dong and output rose by a third to
80,000 metric tons this year from 2010, he said.  “Vietnam has a young population that consumes more and
more coffee, soda, candies and cakes,” said Chu, whose firm is
based in the southern province of Tay Ninh. “Higher incomes
also allow people like farmers to afford sugar.”  Vietnam’s growing demand for sugar is outpacing supply. The
country’s 40 producers only meet 70 percent of the demand for
sugar, according to an Aug. 23 report by Ha Thanh Securities
Joint-Stock Co.  The company is also scouting for domestic sugar producers
it can partner with or acquire, Chu said in a phone interview.  “Within the next three years, mergers and acquisitions are
necessary for the sugar industry to become more competitive
regionally and internationally,” he said.  Many of  Vietnam ’s sugar companies aren’t competitive
regionally, Chu said. Most plants process about 1,500 tons to
2,000 tons per day, while capacity at factories in neighboring
countries is at least 10,000 tons daily, he said.  Capacity Boost  Bourbon Tay Ninh boosted its capacity to 9,000 tons per day
for the 2011-2012 crop, from 8,000 tons in the previous crop, he
said. Its land under cultivation will increase to 15,000
hectares (37,000 acres) in 2012-2013, from 12,000 hectares as
the company gives farmers capital and technical assistance.  Production also increased this year because of good
weather, Chu said. He expects a drop in output in 2011-2012
because of heavy rain in September and October. The sugar cane
will be better quality and yield more sugar, helping to make up
for the drop in output, Chu said.  Bourbon Tay Ninh rose 0.9 percent to 11,300 dong in Ho Chi
Minh City yesterday. The company has fallen 16 percent this
year, compared with a 23 percent decline for the benchmark  VN
Index. (VNINDEX)   Vietnam’s consumer goods industry is being fueled by a
young population and rising incomes and has attracted foreign
companies from  KKR & Co. (KKR)  to Burger King Holdings Inc. The
nation’s per capita income is forecast to rise to as much as
$1,537 next year from an estimated $1,385 this year, according
to a government report released on Oct. 20.  Masan Consumer Corp., a unit of Masan Group, the country’s
biggest listed company, agreed in April to sell a 10 percent
stake to KKR & Co., the investment firm managed by  Henry Kravis 
and  George Roberts , for $159 million in Vietnam’s largest
private-equity investment.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
