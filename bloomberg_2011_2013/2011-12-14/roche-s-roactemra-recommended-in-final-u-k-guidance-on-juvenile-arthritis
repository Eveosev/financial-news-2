Roche Holding AG (ROG) ’s RoActemra won
the backing of the U.K.’s National Institute for Health and
Clinical Excellence in final guidelines for treating patients
with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis.  The guidelines would allow RoActemra as an option for
children age 2 and older whose illness hasn’t adequately
responded to other therapies, as long as Basel, Switzerland-
based Roche makes the drug available to the state-run medical
system at a discount, the institute, known as NICE, said today
in an e-mailed statement.  NICE advises the  National Health Service  on the cost-
effectiveness of treatments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
