The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars rose against the U.S. currency and the yen as better
U.S. economic data and easing concern European funding stress
was deepening increased demand for higher-yielding assets.  Reports in the U.S. showed New York-region manufacturing
expanded and claims for unemployment benefits dropped, adding to
speculation the economic recovery is quickening.  Spain  sold more
than its maximum target at a debt auction, buoying stocks and
assets linked to growth. The Aussie and kiwi dropped earlier
after commodity prices slumped.  “We had a very significant calming in European credit
markets and the U.S. data was pretty good, which is underpinning
the risk sentiment,” said Boris Schlossberg, director of
research at online currency trader GFT Forex in  New York . “All
of that is contributing to the notion that the world is not
coming to an end tomorrow.”  The Australian dollar rose 0.3 percent to 99.35 U.S. cents
at 1:11 p.m. in New York after earlier falling as much as 0.5
percent. The currency was little changed at 77.35 yen.  New Zealand’s currency added 0.5 percent to 75.42 U.S.
cents after touching 74.62 cents, the weakest since Nov. 28. It
rose 0.3 percent to 58.74 yen.  Stocks, Commodities  The MSCI World  Index (CRY)  of equities advanced 0.5 percent while
the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB  Index  of raw materials fell as
much as 0.4 percent.  Spain sold 6.03 billion euros ($7.9 billion) of bonds
today, compared with the maximum target of 3.5 billion euros the
Treasury set for the auction. The yield on the security due in
April 2021, which acts as the 10-year benchmark, was 5.545
percent, compared with 5.433 percent when it was last auctioned
on Oct. 20. The nation also sold debt due in 2016 and 2020.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s general  economic
index  rose to 9.5, from 0.6 in November. Economists projected
the gauge would rise to 3, based on the median of 55 forecasts
in a Bloomberg News survey. A separate report showed that the
number of applications for  unemployment benefits  dropped last
week to 366,000, the lowest level in three years, showing the
U.S. labor market is healing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
