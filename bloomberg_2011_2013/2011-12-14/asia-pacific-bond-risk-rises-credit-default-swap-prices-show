The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default increased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  climbed three basis points to 212 basis
points as of 8:34 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The gauge is set for its highest close
since Nov. 29, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index rose one basis point to
195 basis points as of 11:12 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Westpac Banking Corp. The index is also headed for its highest
close since Nov. 29 according to CMA, which is owned by CME
Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index increased two basis points to
190 as of 9:21 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
