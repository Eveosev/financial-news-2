Firefighters were battling a blaze
after an oil pipeline was hit by two large explosions near the
southern Iraqi city of Basra yesterday, the  Associated Press 
reported, citing the deputy head of the Basra provincial council
Ahmed al-Sulaiti.  Authorities didn’t know what caused the blasts near the
Rumaila oil field, while a security official said the explosions
were caused by bombs, the AP said. The security official asked
not to be identified because he wasn’t authorized to speak to
the media.  To contact the reporter on this story:
