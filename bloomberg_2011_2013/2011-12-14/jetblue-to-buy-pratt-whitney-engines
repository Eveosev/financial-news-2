JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU)  agreed to buy
86 engines valued at about $1.03 billion from United
Technologies Corp.’s  Pratt & Whitney  unit for 40 Airbus SAS
A320neo jets the carrier ordered earlier this year.  The airline becomes the first U.S. airline customer for the
PurePower geared turbofan engine on the A320neo, the companies
said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. JetBlue, based in New
York, declined to comment about cost. The engines have an
estimated list price of about $12 million each, though carriers
usually get discounts on large orders.  Pratt & Whitney beat out  CFM International , a joint venture
of  General Electric Co. (GE)  and  Safran SA. (SAF)  JetBlue has been
evaluating engine suppliers since announcing a $2.5 billion
order for the Airbus planes in June. The new model provides
longer range and as much as 15 percent in fuel savings compared
with the airline’s current A320s.  “We are confident we’ve made an excellent choice for our
aircraft,” JetBlue Chief Executive Officer Dave Barger said in
the statement.  JetBlue’s current A320 jets have engines made by
International Aero Engines, a joint venture in which Pratt &
Whitney in October agreed to acquire a controlling interest.
JetBlue’s Embraer SA E190s have GE engines.  The new Pratt & Whitney agreement includes long-term
maintenance. Before the JetBlue accord, the unit of Hartford,
Connecticut-based  United Technologies (UTX)  already had firm engine
orders for 370 A320neos.  JetBlue is scheduled to receive the first of its twin-
engine A320neos in 2018.  The A320neo has become the best-selling aircraft in
aviation history, with Toulouse, France-based Airbus securing
about 1,200 firm orders during the past year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
