A boom in liquefied natural gas
exports and growing demand in  Asia  may pave the way for a
trading hub in Singapore and a benchmark price for the fuel,
according to the International Energy Agency.  “There is a huge, new wave of LNG projects coming to the
market,”  Fatih Birol , chief economist at the Paris-based
International Energy Agency said in an interview in the city-
state today, citing gas export plans in  Australia  and Papua New
Guinea. “At the same time, we expect substantial growth of
demand in Asia,” particularly in China and  India , Birol said.  The renegotiation of supply contracts by  South Korea  and
 Japan , the world’s biggest buyers, may also encourage more trade
outside long-term contracts, Birol said. Most LNG is sold on a
term basis, while fuel in the  spot market  is sold cargo-by-
cargo.  “Put all of them together, and I think we will see a
golden age of gas in that region,” Birol said. “Therefore,
there is a need for something like spot oil trading.”  Singapore, the oil-trading hub of Asia, is “very
appropriate” base to build LNG trading, Birol said. A spot
market in the city could be developed “through 2020,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
