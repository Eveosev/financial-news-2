Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) ’s
Australian unit BOS International sold a loan it made to Nine
Entertainment Co., the media company that’s seeking to
restructure its debt, according to a spokesperson at the bank.  Following yesterday’s auction, the bank’s holding of Nine
Entertainment debt is now in line with its target, the
spokesperson said, asking not to be named in accordance with
company policy. The person declined to state the target, the
price or the amount of debt sold.  Nine, the Australian media company owned by CVC Asia
Pacific Ltd., this month proposed dividing its A$2.8 billion
($2.8 billion) of debt, people familiar with the matter said on
Dec. 12. Hedge funds own about 60 percent of the media company’s
loans and are seeking to take control, the Australian newspaper
reported today, citing an unidentified person at a hedge fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
