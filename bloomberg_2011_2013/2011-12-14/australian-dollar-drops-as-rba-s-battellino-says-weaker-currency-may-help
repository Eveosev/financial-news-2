The Australian dollar dropped as
 Reserve Bank  of Australia Deputy Governor  Ric Battellino  said a
likely fall in the currency will help insulate the nation from
an economic slump in  Europe , where a “disruptive event” can’t be
ruled out.  The so-called Aussie slid 0.3 percent to 99.88 U.S. cents
at 12:40 p.m. in Sydney from yesterday in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
