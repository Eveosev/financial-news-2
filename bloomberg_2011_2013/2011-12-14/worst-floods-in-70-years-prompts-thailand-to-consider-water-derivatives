Thailand  may start trading of water
derivatives, giving investors a means of hedging against
disasters after the nation’s worst floods in almost 70 years,
the  Securities & Exchange Commission  said.  The regulator is studying the possibility of introducing
contracts whose value would be linked to rainfall, or the level
of water in the nation’s major dams, said Vorapol Socatiyanurak,
who started as secretary-general of the SEC in October. He
declined to say when trading might begin.  Thailand is seeking to offer protection to investors in
 Southeast Asia ’s second-biggest economy after flooding in the
central region killed almost 700 people and swamped about 1,500
industrial facilities. The waters may cause 1.3 trillion baht
($41.6 billion) of damage to the economy, Prime Minister
Yingluck Shinawatra said on Dec. 8.  Intel Corp ., the world’s
largest chipmaker, cut its revenue forecast this week as the
floods disrupted personal-computer production.  “Flooding has become more frequent in Thailand, with much
greater economic impact,” Vorapol said in an interview in
Bangkok yesterday. “The new security would offer investors,
insurers and manufacturers an instrument to help alleviate
financial losses in future catastrophes.”  The contracts would also help protect farmers from the
impact of floods and drought, Vorapol said.  Liquidity Risk  The total face value of global weather-related derivatives
grew by 20 percent between 2010 and 2011 to $11.8 billion,
according to a May 20  report  by the Washington DC-based Weather
Risk Management Association. Demand growth was seen in contracts
related to rainfall, snow, hurricanes and wind from industries
such as agriculture, construction and transport, it said.  The majority of weather contracts are traded on the  Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. (CME)  CME snow contracts, for example, are based
on the exchange’s Snowfall Index, a measure of average monthly
snowfall in certain U.S. cities. Traders “determine what amount
of snowfall would be detrimental to their businesses and take
futures or options positions based on that,” the exchange said
on its website.  “The new instrument is unlikely to help cover all exposure
from water-related risk, but it’s good to provide another
alternative,” said Sanya Harnpatanakitpanich, head of
derivatives at Globlex Securities Co. Ltd., the nation’s largest
derivatives brokerage by trading volume. “The SEC and Stock
Exchange of Thailand need major market makers such as foreign
companies and domestic water utilities to assure the trading
liquidity of water derivatives.”  Insurance Payouts  The Cabinet urged insurers to pay companies and households
affected by flooding within six months, deputy government
spokeswoman Anuttama Amornvivat said yesterday. The Office of
Insurance Commission estimated that insurers would pay out 262
billion baht ($8.4 billion), with 228 billion going to 928
factories and the rest to households, she told reporters.  California-based Intel reduced its fourth-quarter revenue
forecast on Dec. 12 by about $1 billion, saying a shortage of
hard-disk drives as a result of Thailand’s floods is cutting
customers’ production of personal computers. Thailand is home to
plants producing about a quarter of the world’s hard-disk
drives.  Honda Motor Co. (7267)  and  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  also cut their
profit estimates after the floods disrupted output.  Bond Sales  Thailand’s regulator also plans to relax rules to encourage
bond sales by small and medium-sized companies whose access to
investors may be hampered by low credit ratings, Vorapol said.
Those issuers will probably be allowed to sell the bonds to some
wealthy individuals, he said.  The SEC allows only Thai and foreign companies with
investment-grade ratings to sell bonds to individual investors,
he said. It may also allow more investment by mutual funds in
bonds with credit ratings below investment grade, he said.  Vorapol, 56, was appointed the head of the regulatory
agency for the nation’s equity, bond and derivative markets in
October. He has a doctorate from the  University of
Pennsylvania ’s Wharton School and was a lecturer at the  National
Institute of Development Administration , a state university.  He was hired after his predecessor Thirachai Phuvanatnaranubala resigned to become finance minister.  To contact the reporter on this story:
