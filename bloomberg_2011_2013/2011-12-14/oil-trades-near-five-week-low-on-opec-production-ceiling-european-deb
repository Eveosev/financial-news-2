Oil advanced from a five-week low in
 New York  as investors speculated that yesterday’s drop, the
biggest since September, was exaggerated.  West Texas Intermediate futures gained as much as 0.9
percent today after falling yesterday and nearing the 50-day
moving average of about $94.24 a barrel, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Buy orders tend to be clustered near
chart-support levels. Oil fell after OPEC raised its output
ceiling and  Europe ’s debt crisis worsened, threatening a
recession that may curb demand for commodities.  “There is buying interest on the dips,”  Ken Hasegawa , a
commodity-derivatives sales manager at Newedge in  Tokyo  said in
an interview. “This level, $95 for WTI, is one of the key
points to buy. It’s not only short-covering, but there might be
some fresh long positions.”  Crude for January delivery increased as much as 83 cents to
$95.78 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $95.21 at 4:50 p.m. Sydney time. The
contract yesterday slid 5.2 percent to $94.95, the lowest close
since Nov. 4. Prices are 4.2 percent higher this year after
climbing 15 percent in 2010.  Brent oil for January settlement rose 0.7 percent to
$105.78 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.
The contract expires today. The more-actively traded February
future climbed 99 cents to $105.24. The European benchmark
contract’s premium to West Texas Intermediate was at $10.63,
compared with a record $27.88 on Oct. 14.  OPEC, Oil Stockpiles  Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries yesterday agreed to raise their output target to 30
million barrels a day, changing its production quota for the
first time in three years.  U.S. crude stockpiles declined 1.9 million barrels last
week, according to a report from the Energy Department yesterday.
It was the first drop in  three weeks . They were forecast to
decline 2.5 million barrels, according to the median of 12
analyst estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Gasoline supplies gained 3.8 million barrels to 218.8
million barrels, Energy Department data shows. They were
estimated to rise 1.2 million barrels, according to the  survey .
Distillate inventories, a category that includes heating oil and
diesel, climbed 480,000 barrels compared with a projection for a
1 million barrel increase.  The euro-area economy is likely to slip back into a
recession and its leaders’ new plan to end the debt crisis
hasn’t completely eliminated the risk of a breakup of the
currency region, according to an Ernst & Young LLP report
published in  London  today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
