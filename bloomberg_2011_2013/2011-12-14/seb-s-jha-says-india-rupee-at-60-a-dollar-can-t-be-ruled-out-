Sailesh K. Jha, the Singapore-based
head of  Asia  markets strategy at Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken
AB, comments on the outlook for the rupee in a report published
today.  The currency fell 0.7 percent yesterday to 53.2250 and
touched a record-low 53.52. It has slid 16 percent this year,
the worst performance among Asia’s 10 most-traded currencies.  “The risks that the rupee prints 60 in the first half of
2012 can’t be ruled out.  “The balance of payments is probably already in deficit
and will remain so in the first quarter of 2012. Importers’
hedging of  currency risk  has been limited, and risks of a dollar
funding squeeze need to be considered as global risk appetite
continues to soften into the first quarter.  “Large trade deficits will remain on back of strong
imports of oil, gold and consumer goods. This will outweigh the
impact of a recovery in exports of processed crude-oil products,
chemicals and machinery exports.  “From a capital flows perspective we anticipate continued
net outflows from the equity market into the first half as
uncertainty on the outlook for  India ’s growth, inflation and
macroeconomic policies lingers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
