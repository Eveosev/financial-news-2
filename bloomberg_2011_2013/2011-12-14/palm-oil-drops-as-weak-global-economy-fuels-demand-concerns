Palm oil  declined on concerns that
the weakness in the global economy may affect demand for
vegetable oils and lower exports from  Malaysia , the second
largest producer.  The February-delivery contract dropped as much as 0.7
percent to 2,980 ringgit ($935) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange and closed the morning session at 2,994
ringgit in Kuala Lumpur.  Asia’s stock markets declined after the U.S. Federal
Reserve refrained from taking more steps to spur growth and U.S.
retail sales gained at the slowest pace in five months. The Fed
yesterday repeated a warning from its two previous meetings that
“strains in global financial markets continue to pose
significant downside risks to the economic outlook.”  “The underlying weakness in the global economy because of
all the uncertainties have led to concerns that demand for
vegetable oils may be affected,” Ivy Ng, an analyst at CIMB
Group Holdings Bhd., said by phone from  Kuala Lumpur . “The
export data so far this month suggests a weak demand trend.”  Malaysia’s palm oil exports fell 4.6 percent to 436,633
tons in the first 10 days of December from the same period a
month earlier, Societe Generale de Surveillance said yesterday.
Shipments fell 5.1 percent to 443,699 tons, Intertek said Dec 12.  Malaysia’s palm oil  inventories  remained above the 2
million ton mark for the third month in November as exports
shrank 9.9 percent to 1.7 million tons, the Malaysian Palm Oil
Board said yesterday. Stockpiles declined 1.5 percent to 2.1
million tons. Output declined 14.8 percent to 1.6 million tons
in November from a month earlier, it said.  January-delivery soybeans declined as much as 0.6 percent
to $11.115 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade before trading
at $11.14 at 12:28 p.m. in  Singapore .  Soybean oil  for March
delivery fell as much as 0.2 percent to 49.52 cents a pound.  Palm oil for delivery in May declined as much as 1.7
percent to 7,690 yuan ($1,207) per ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange  and soybean oil for September delivery climbed as much
as 0.3 percent to 8,760 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
