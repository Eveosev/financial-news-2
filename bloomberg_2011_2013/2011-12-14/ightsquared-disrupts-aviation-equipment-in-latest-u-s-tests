Philip Falcone ’s LightSquared
wireless service disrupts safety equipment that uses the global-
positioning system to help keep airliners from crashing into the
ground, U.S. officials said.  LightSquared’s signals caused “interference with a flight
safety system designed to warn pilots of approaching terrain”
in government tests of the proposed network, according to a
statement from the Defense and Transportation departments
distributed yesterday by e-mail.  U.S. officials are testing for interference with GPS
devices as they consider whether to let LightSquared operate its
network. The service would let clients, such as Best Buy Co.,
offer cheaper wireless services and products, LightSquared Chief
Executive Officer  Sanjiv Ahuja  said in a Dec. 9 interview.  LightSquared has proposed offering high-speed mobile
Internet to as many as 260 million people. The Reston, Virginia-
based company is backed by $3 billion from Falcone’s Harbinger
Capital Partners hedge fund. Harbinger peaked at $26 billion in
2008 after a successful bet on the housing market and has
slipped to $5.7 billion in assets.  LightSquared’s critics say the service’s powerful signals
from 40,000 base stations would overwhelm faint emissions from
satellites that feed GPS devices. LightSquared says that GPS
devices improperly gather signals from its swath of airwaves.  The company will work with the  Federal Aviation
Administration  on resolving interference with terrain-avoidance
systems identified yesterday, Ahuja said in an e-mailed
statement.  ‘Laws of Physics’  “The laws of physics have not changed,”  Steve Lott ,
spokesman for Airlines for America, a trade group representing
large carriers, said in an e-mailed statement. “The most recent
report adds to the growing research and data showing that
LightSquared transmitters could effectively jam the GPS network
over the populated areas of the  United States .”  Members of the Washington-based group, formerly known as
the  Air Transport Association , include  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) ,
 Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV)  and AMR Corp.’s  American Airlines .  Yesterday’s findings were distributed to a steering group
representing seven federal agencies that make up the National
Executive Committee for Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and
Timing, according to the statement. The interagency body
coordinates federal use of GPS equipment, and will make
recommendations to agencies that regulate airwaves use.  Testing found “no significant interference with cellular
phones,”  according to the statement . “However, the testing did
show that LightSquared signals caused harmful interference to
the majority of other tested general-purpose GPS receivers.”  Navigation Devices  The results validate LightSquared’s “compatibility with
the nation’s 300 million cellular phones,” Ahuja said in his e-
mailed statement yesterday. “We profoundly disagree with the
conclusions drawn with respect to general navigation devices.”  The general-purpose tests on devices used in automobiles
and boats showed that LightSquared’s signals caused harmful
interference to 75 percent of GPS units used in cars and boats,
according to a draft summary seen last week by Bloomberg News.  Fewer devices are affected if LightSquared proposals to
reduce its power are taken into account, and all remain
“completely operable,” Terry Neal, a LightSquared spokesman,
said in an interview Dec. 13.  More government tests are planned for high-precision GPS
receivers, a category that includes those used for scientific
monitoring and for timing electricity distribution.  ‘Pull Up!’  LightSquared’s effect on the air-safety system was the
subject of a separate analysis by the FAA, according to
yesterday’s statement.  The safety system displays any terrain or man-made
obstruction in the path of an aircraft. If a plane flies too
close to danger, the system sounds increasingly dire warnings
urging a pilot to “Pull up!”  These devices have been required on turbine-powered
aircraft since 2005 and are credited with nearly eliminating
crashes in which pilots hit the ground in darkness or bad
weather, according to the FAA. The system uses GPS to determine
a plane’s position, which it matches against a worldwide
database of terrain, radio towers, buildings and airports.  The U.S. testing is being coordinated by the  National
Telecommunications and Information Administration , an arm of the
Commerce Department. The agency is assessing test results, Moira
Vahey, a spokeswoman, said yesterday in an interview.  ‘Serious’ Interference  “The results reported today confirm yet again the depth
and breadth of the serious GPS interference problems raised by
LightSquared’s proposed plans, even after many rounds of changes
to these plans by LightSquared,” Dale Leibach, a spokesman for
the Coalition to Save Our GPS, said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday.  The organization, formed to oppose LightSquared’s plans,
includes navigation-gear makers  Garmin Ltd. (GRMN)  and  Trimble
Navigation Ltd. (TRMB) , and package shippers  FedEx Corp. (FDX)  and  United
Parcel Service Inc. (UPS)   Also yesterday, the U.S. House passed language requiring
the defense secretary to notify Congress if there is widespread
interference with the military’s use of GPS caused by a
commercial communications service.  “It is unacceptable for our armed forces to be put at
greater risk or made less effective as a result of
LightSquared’s operations,” Representative  Michael Turner , an
Ohio Republican who inserted the language into a defense
spending bill, said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
