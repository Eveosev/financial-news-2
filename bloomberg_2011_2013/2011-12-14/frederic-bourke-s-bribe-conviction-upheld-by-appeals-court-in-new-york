Frederic Bourke, the co-founder of
handbag maker Dooney & Bourke who yesterday lost his appeal of a
bribery conviction, suffered a second setback when the judge on
his case denied his request for a new trial.  The  U.S. Court of Appeals  in  Manhattan  yesterday upheld
Bourke’s conviction by a jury two years ago. Separately, Bourke
had asked the trial judge for a new trial or to reopen his case
so his lawyers could question a prosecutor on whether a witness
gave false testimony. The judge today denied that request.  U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin in Manhattan said in a
28-page ruling that Bourke had leapt “to the conclusion” that
prosecutors presented perjured testimony. She also said that
Bourke hadn’t come forward with “newly discovered evidence,”
as he claimed.  Bourke, who is free on bail, was convicted of conspiring to
violate U.S. anti-corruption laws by joining in a bribery scheme
in an oil deal 13 years ago in  Azerbaijan . He was sentenced to
one year in prison.  Bourke’s lawyer, Michael Tigar, didn’t immediately return a
call seeking comments on the judge’s decision.  The Bourke case is U.S. v. Bourke, 05-cr-00518, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
