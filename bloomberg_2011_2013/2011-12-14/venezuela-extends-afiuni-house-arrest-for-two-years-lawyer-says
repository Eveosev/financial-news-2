A Venezuelan judge extended the
house arrest of Maria Lourdes Afiuni, considered a political
prisoner by  Human Rights Watch , for two years.  Judge Ali Fabricio Paredes made the ruling today, Jose
Amalio Graterol, one of Afiuni’s lawyers, said in comments
carried on the Globovision network.  Afiuni, a judge in Caracas, was arrested in December 2009
for ordering the conditional release of banker Eligio Cedeno,
who was accused of fraudulently obtaining dollars from the
government in 2003. She had ruled that prosecutors had exceeded
the time limit to bring Cedeno’s case to court.  Afiuni was held in a women’s prison until February and was
granted leave to be held at home after doctors said she required
an operation for cancer.  Human Rights Watch has  said  Afiuni’s case shows how
President  Hugo Chavez ’s government “has demonstrated its
fundamental disregard for the principle of judicial
independence.” Chavez, speaking on state television on Dec. 11,
2009, called for Afiuni to “pay” with “30 years in prison”
for ordering Cedeno’s release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
