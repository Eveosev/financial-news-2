Oil fell from the highest in almost
a week in  New York  amid signs the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will agree to maintain production of crude
when it meets in Vienna today.  Futures for January delivery slid as much as 41 cents, or
0.4 percent, to $99.73 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  and were at $99.76 at 12:45 p.m. Sydney
time. The contract yesterday surged 2.4 percent to $100.14, the
highest close since Dec. 7.  OPEC members agreed that the group should set a output
ceiling for the first half of next year of 30 million barrels a
day, said a delegate who declined to be identified.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
