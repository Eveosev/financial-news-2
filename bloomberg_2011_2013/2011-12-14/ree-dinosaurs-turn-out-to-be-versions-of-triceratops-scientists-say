The  Triceratops , first discovered in
1889, has an identity crisis, scientists said.  What was thought to be three separate dinosaurs have now
been reclassified as one, the horned-face Triceratops, according
to a paper today in the journal  PLoS One . The two other
dinosaurs, called  Torosaurus  and Nedoceratops, were found to be
older versions of the beast, which grew to about 25 feet long
and weighed an estimated six tons, researchers said.  “We have just begun to learn how it grew from a baby to an
adult in the past few years,” said  John Scannella , a researcher
at Montana State University in Bozeman and a study author.  The reclassified dinosaurs were both thought to be members
of species distinct from the Triceratops, which despite its
fearsome appearance was a plant-eater that lived about 65
million to 70 million years ago during the Cretaceous period.  As more Triceratops bones were found, though, scientists
began to suspect the structure of their skulls probably changed
as they aged, Scannella said. They confirmed the idea by cutting
up skulls from all three types, lining up the features and
determining that all the different skulls came from Triceratops
of different ages.  “We can’t hatch a living Triceratops and watch it grow up
and study how its skull changes shape -- but this is the next
best thing,” Scannella said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
