Singapore ’s economy may expand less
than previously estimated in 2012, a central bank survey of
economists showed, as  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis curbs
demand for Asian exports.  Gross domestic product  may rise 3 percent in 2012 after
climbing an estimated 5.2 percent this year, according to the
median estimate of 21 economists and analysts in a survey by the
 Monetary Authority of Singapore  released today. Last quarter’s
poll had a median forecast of 4.9 percent for next year.  Nations from  China  to  Indonesia  have eased monetary policy
in recent weeks to protect growth as the global recovery falters.
Singapore’s government has said the city-state’s economy may
expand as little as 1 percent in 2012, and the central bank,
which uses the  exchange rate  to manage inflation, said in
October it will slow gains in the local dollar.  Singapore’s “export sector is facing tremendous headwinds
as the malaise in Europe and the sluggish recovery in the U.S.
are taking a huge toll on global demand,”  Irvin Seah , an
economist at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. in Singapore, said in a
note today before the survey was released.  The Singapore dollar may strengthen to S$1.23 versus the
U.S. currency by the end of 2012, from an estimate of S$1.28 at
the end of this year, the survey showed. Inflation may slow to
3.1 percent in 2012 from a prediction of 5.1 percent this year.  The local currency has weakened 1.7 percent against the  U.S.
dollar  so far this year. It fell 0.3 percent to S$1.3055 as of
11:22 a.m. local time, dropping for a fifth day. The benchmark
Straits Times Index of stocks has lost about 16 percent in 2011.  Non-oil domestic exports  may climb 3.1 percent in 2012,
from 2.1 percent this year, according to the median estimates in
the MAS survey.  The estimates for construction in 2012 ranged from a 6.5
percent contraction to a 3 percent increase. Singapore last week
imposed additional taxes on purchases of private residential
property, which threatens to curb demand for real estate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
