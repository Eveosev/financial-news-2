Milwaukee Bucks center Andrew Bogut
is  Australia ’s highest earning sports star for the first time
with A$13 million ($13 million), according to Business Review
Weekly’s annual survey of the nation’s top 50 sports earners.  Bogut’s salary with the National Basketball Association
team puts the 27-year-old ahead of three motor sportsmen and
makes him the first basketball player to take the top spot, the
magazine said in an e-mailed statement.  Formula One driver  Mark Webber , who topped last year’s
list, fell to third place after his number of Grand Prix race
victories dropped to one in 2011 from four the previous season.
Casey Stoner, who won his second MotoGP world championship in
October, came in second with earnings of $A9.5 million,
A$500,000 more than motocross rider Chad Reed.  Cyclist  Cadel Evans  was ranked fifth after becoming the
first Australian to win the Tour de  France  in July.  Below is a table showing Australia’s top 5 sports earners,
according to BRW. The full list will be published tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
