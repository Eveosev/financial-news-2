(Corrects story published on Dec. 14 to say Marubeni will
own 30 percent of the mine in second paragraph.)  Antofagasta Plc’s (ANTO)  board approved the
$1.3 billion Antucoya copper project in  Chile , which it says may
boost the company’s total output of the metal to 800,000 metric
tons by 2015.  Japan ’s  Marubeni Corp. (8002)  will become a 30 percent owner in
the project for $350 million, London-based Antofagasta said
today in a statement to the London Stock Exchange. Marubeni is a
shareholder in Antofagasta’s Los Pelambres, Esperanza and El
Tesoro mines in Chile.  Antofagasta is “confident” about long-term copper demand,
Marcelo Awad, chief executive officer of Antofagasta’s mining
division, said in the statement. The company, which operates
four copper mines in Chile, has a “strong pipeline” of
projects to supply growing consumption of the metal, he said.  Antucoya will produce 80,000 tons a year of refined copper
by dissolving the ore in acid, using a process known as heap-
leach, the company said. Antucoya is 45 kilometers (28 miles)
from the company’s Michilla copper mine in the Atacama Desert.  Copper fell 2.4 percent to $3.3595 a pound at 8:26 a.m. in
 New York . Prices have dropped 24 percent this year because of
concerns economies will slow, curbing demand.  Antofagasta expects its total output this year to reach
about 640,000 tons, Francisco Veloso, vice president of
corporate affairs, said Dec. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
