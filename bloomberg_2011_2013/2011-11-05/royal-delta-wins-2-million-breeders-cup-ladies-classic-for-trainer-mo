Uncle Mo, scratched as the favorite
in the 2011  Kentucky Derby  because of a rare liver disease, has
rebounded to take on Havre de Grace in the $5 million  Breeders’
Cup Classic , the richest thoroughbred race in  North America .  Today’s Classic caps two days of racing in the $26 million
Breeders’ Cup Championship, the world’s richest two-day sporting
event at Churchill Downs in Louisville,  Kentucky .  Uncle Mo, the winner of last year’s Breeders’ Cup Juvenile
race as a 2-year-old, was installed as the morning line favorite
at 5-2. Havre de Grace, given 3-1 odds, is looking to beat her
male competitors in the 1 1/4-mile race just as Zenyatta did two
years ago.  “The way Mo ran in the Kelso it looked like he could go
two miles, and it didn’t look like anybody could catch him,”
said owner  Mike Repole , a New York businessman who also has Stay
Thirsty (12-1) in the Classic. “I’ve never won a Classic;
(Trainer  Todd Pletcher ) has never won a Classic. I think we have
two great chances of winning this race.”  Havre de Grace took a turn around the track in the dark
yesterday morning.  “We wanted to get out there when we thought the track
would be the best and to also give her experience under the
lights,” said trainer Larry Jones. “She handled things just
fine. We’re ready.”  Royal Delta Wins  During yesterday’s races, Royal Delta outran eight
