Michael Klein will seek next week to
buy as much as 28 percent of  Via Varejo SA (VVAR3)  for more than 2
billion reais ($980 million), newspaper Estado de Sao Paulo
reported, without saying how it obtained the information.  Klein, whose family already owns 47 percent of Via Varejo,
will travel to Paris on Nov. 13 to make the offer to  Casino
Guichard-Perrachon SA (CO) , the Sao Paulo-based newspaper reported.  A press officer for Klein, who canâ€™t be identified under
corporate policy, confirmed that the meeting is scheduled, when
contacted by Bloomberg News. The official declined to comment on
topics that may be discussed at the meeting.  Via Varejo controls retailers Ponto Frio and Casas Bahia
Comercial Ltda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
