New England Patriots  running back
Brandon Bolden was suspended for four games for using
performance-enhancing drugs, the  National Football League  said.  The NFL declined to identify the substance that violated
the league’s drug policy.  The 22-year-old’s suspension is effective immediately, the
league said. He will be eligible to return to the roster Dec. 3
after the team’s game against the  Miami Dolphins .  Bolden, who has missed the Patriots’ last two games with a
knee injury, set career-highs in rushing attempts and yards
against the Buffalo Bills on Sept. 30, finishing with 16 carries
for 137 yards and a touchdown.  For the season, Bolden has totaled 43 rushes for 234 yards
and two touchdowns.  The Patriots are 5-3 to lead the American Football
Conference East. They host the Bills tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
