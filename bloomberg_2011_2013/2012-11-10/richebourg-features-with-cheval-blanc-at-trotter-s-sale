the start of September after a 25-year run, include four bottles
of Richebourg 1986 Henri Jayer Burgundy with an estimate of as 
much as $24,000 and five bottles of Chateau Cheval Blanc 1945 
Bordeaux for up to $12,000, according to the Christie’s catalog.  Christie’s is also selling  wine  in Geneva and for the
Hospices de Beaune in Burgundy, while New York will be the venue
for auctions by Sotheby’s and Acker Merrall & Condit.  Following is a list of global wine sales scheduled for the
rest of this year. Dates may be subject to revision, and links
