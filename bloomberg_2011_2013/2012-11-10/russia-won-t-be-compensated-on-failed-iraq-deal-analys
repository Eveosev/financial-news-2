Russia is unlikely to receive any
compensation if  Iraq  has scrapped a $4.2 billion contract to buy
weapons,  Ruslan Pukhov , head of the Center for Analysis of
Strategies and Technologies in Moscow, said today.  The contract, which would have made Russia the second-
biggest arms supplier to Iraq after the U.S., has been canceled,
said Hakim al-Zamili, a lawmaker on the Iraqi parliament’s
defense and security committee.  “Russia gained nothing from this deal and lost nothing,
except for face,” Pukhov said by phone. “Round one went to
Moscow, round two has been won by the Americans, but there will
be many more rounds before this match is over.”  The weapons deal for Russian MI-28 attack helicopters and
anti-aircraft systems was perceived as a challenge to Iraq’s
military ties to the U.S., Pukhov said. Russia’s government
announced Oct. 9 it signed the weapons deal with the Middle
Eastern country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
