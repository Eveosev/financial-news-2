The European Union will attempt to
agree on its 2013 budget by Nov. 13 after talks in Brussels
failed to reach an agreement yesterday, the EU said.  “The council and the European Parliament, meeting within
the conciliation committee, could not yet reach agreement on the
2013 EU budget,” the EU said in a  press release .  Cyprus, which holds the EU’s rotating presidency, will
continue efforts to reconcile different positions among EU
member nations, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
