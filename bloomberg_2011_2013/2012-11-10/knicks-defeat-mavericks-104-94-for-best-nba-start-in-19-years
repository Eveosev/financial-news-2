The New York Knicks defeated the
Dallas Mavericks 104-94 to improve their record to 4-0, their
best start to the National Basketball Association season in 19
years.  Carmelo Anthony was the game’s high scorer with 31 points
and J.R. Smith came off the bench to score 22 points for the
Knicks last night on their home court at Madison Square Garden.  The last time the Knicks started the season undefeated in
four games was in 1993-94 when they went 7-0 and advanced to the
NBA Finals where they lost the best-of-seven series 4-3 to the
Houston Rockets.  “New York’s a veteran team and if you give them more
possessions and you give them possessions on catastrophic
turnovers, they’re going to convert them into points,” Dallas
coach Rick Carlisle told reporters. “They’re a very good team.
In my opinion they’re one of the handful of teams that has a
chance to come out of the East.”  New York is the only NBA team with a perfect record and
leads the Eastern Conference’s Atlantic Division by 1 ½ games
ahead of the Philadelphia 76ers.  The Knicks had a 55-47 halftime lead over the Mavericks and
outscored Dallas 49-37 in the second half.  O.J. Mayo had 23 points and reserve Vince Carter scored 15
for the Mavericks, who had their three-game winning streak
broken.  To contact the reporter on this story:
