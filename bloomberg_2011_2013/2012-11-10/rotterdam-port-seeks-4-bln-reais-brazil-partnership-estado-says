Netherlands ’s Rotterdam Port is
seeking a partnership to build a Brazil port that would require
about a 4 billion reais ($1.95 million) investment, Estado de
Sao Paulo reported, citing Rotterdam spokesman Minico Van Hezen.  The Dutch port aims to seal an agreement by early next year
with Brazil’s Terminal Presidente Kennedy to build in Brazil’s
Espirito Santo state, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper said, citing
Van Hezen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
