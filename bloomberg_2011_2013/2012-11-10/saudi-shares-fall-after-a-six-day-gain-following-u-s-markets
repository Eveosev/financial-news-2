Saudi Arabian shares fell for the
first time in seven trading sessions, led by petrochemical
companies and banks, following U.S. markets lower after
President  Barack Obama ’s re-election.  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the world’s largest
petrochemical maker, known as Sabic, dropped the most since Oct.
23.  Al Rajhi Bank (RJHI) , the largest Saudi lender by market value,
fell the greatest amount in five days. Anaam International
Holding Group Co. dropped to the lowest level since Sept. 11
last year after the company announced it was raising capital by
80 percent.  The  Tadawul All-Share Index (SASEIDX)  declined 0.3 percent, the
steepest fall since Oct. 22, to 6919.06 at the 3:30 p.m. close
in  Riyadh . The Arab world’s biggest bourse has gained 7.8
percent this year.  “This decline is due to profit-taking after last week’s
rise,” Turki Fadaak, head of research at Albilad Investment Co.
in Riyadh, said in an e-mail.  U.S. stocks had their biggest weekly decline since June as
Obama’s re-election set up a budget showdown with the
Republican-controlled House of Representatives. The S&P 500
dropped 2.4 percent to 1,379.85 for the week.  Sabic lost 0.8 percent to 90.75 riyals, while Al Rajhi
dropped 0.7 percent to 69.75 riyals.  Anaam (ANAAM)  fell 32 percent to
49.30 riyals after the Saudi agriculture and food processing
company said it will issue 8.7 million shares at 10 riyals a
share.  “The increase in capital will be to expand our food-
processing activity,” Hassan Al Yamani, Anaam’s general
manager, said in an interview with Al Arabiya television today.
“We aim to become one of the best poultry producers in the
Saudi market.”  Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is the only Persian Gulf
bourse operating on Saturdays.  To contact the reporters on this story:
