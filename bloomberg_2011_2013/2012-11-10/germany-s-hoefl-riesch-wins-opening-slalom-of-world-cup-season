Maria Hoefl-Riesch of Germany used a
strong second run to win the first slalom race of the World Cup
ski season in  Finland .  Hoefl-Riesch beat Finland’s Tanja Poutiainen, who led after
the first run in Levi, by 0.55 seconds. American Mikaela
Schiffrin was 0.74 seconds back in third place.  Tina Maze  of Slovenia, who won the giant slalom in the
season opener two weeks ago, was fourth to maintain the overall
World Cup lead.  Defending slalom champion Marlies Schild of Austria crashed
on her first run, while overall World Cup titleholder Lindsey
Vonn of the U.S. skipped the race.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
