Hungary, which plans to take over
most of the debt accumulated by local governments, would be
considered to be in default if the state decided against paying
back the loans in full, Premier  Viktor Orban  said, MTI reported.  It’s “premature” to talk about Hungary’s strategy to
dealing with municipal debt since the government has yet to
assume the loans, Orban said in an interview, according to the
state news service.  “The speculation that if the government doesn’t pay back
the debt or part of it would be a default is” as simple as
“two times two” equals four, Orban said, according to MTI.
“In the modern financial world everybody knows that if the
debtor doesn’t pay it’s considered a default.”  Hungary is seeking a haircut of between 20 percent and 25
percent on all municipal debt the state is assuming, Magyar
Nemzet reported today, citing unidentified government and ruling
party sources.  Hungary ’s central government will
take over 612 billion forint ($2.7 billion) of 983 billion
forint in local council debt to avert a breakdown in their
operations, Orban said on Oct. 27.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
