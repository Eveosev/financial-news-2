China  has paid a “huge”
environmental price for development, Zhou Ji, president of the
Chinese Academy of Engineering, said at a briefing today.  The world’s second-biggest economy can’t rely further on
resource exploitation for development, Zhou said at a briefing
in Beijing held as part of the 18th Chinese Communist Party
Congress.  Zhou also said China needs to improve the quality of
education offered in the country. Education in China is
currently weak in promoting innovation, Zhou said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
