Belgium’s Financial Services and
Markets Authority proposed about 1.6 million euros ($2 million)
in fines against  Fortis Bank SA/NV (FBAVP)  and three former executives
for activities in 2008 and 2009, L’Echo newspaper  reported .  An FSMA investigation found evidence the company
distributed misleading information and the regulator has
recommended fines of 250,000 euros each against Fortis SA/NV,
Fortis NV and former deputy chief executive Herman Verwilst,
L’Echo said. FSMA also seeks fines of 500,000 euros from former
chief executive Jean-Paul Votron and 400,000 euros from former
chief risk officer Gilbert Mitler, the newspaper reported.  A representative for Fortis, now known as  Ageas (AGS) , couldn’t
immediately be reached for comment outside of normal business
hours. The L’Echo report said each case will be handled
separately in administrative proceedings that can be appealed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
