Households in  Brazil ’s  Sao Paulo 
state are facing shortages of canned gas used for cooking
because of a workers strike, newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo
reported, citing an official at gas distribution association
Siregas.  Gas is rationed in the entire state, Giovanni Buzzo, who
heads Siregas, told the Sao Paulo-based newspaper. Gas
distribution workers in Sao Paulo, who started striking this
week, are demanding a 7.4 percent salary increase, compared to
the 6 percent offered by companies, Folha said, without saying
how it obtained the information.  Sao Paulo is Brazil’s most populated state.  To contact the reporter on this story:
