Embraer SA (EMBR3)  aims to start building
ships for the Brazilian navy, newspaper O Globo reported, citing
people in the company it didn’t identify.  Becoming a supplier for the navy may require acquiring or
forming partnerships with existing shipyards, Globo columnist
Flavia Oliveira reported. No partnerships or acquisitions have
been made yet, the Rio de Janeiro-based newspaper said.  Embraer officials didn’t immediately respond to a phone
message and e-mails from  Bloomberg News  seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
