Six-time champion Roger Federer will
play Andy Murray, while top-ranked Novak Djokovic faces Juan-
Martin  Del Potro  in the last four of the ATP World Tour Finals.  The semi-final line-up was completed after Spain’s David
Ferrer defeated Janko Tipsarevic of  Serbia , 4-6, 6-3, 6-1 in the
final round-robin match of the season-ending championships at
London’s O2 arena.  The season-ending event splits the top eight singles
players and doubles pairs into groups of four. The top two in
each group reach the single-elimination semifinals tomorrow,
with the final scheduled for Nov. 12.  Federer, the winner of group B, trails U.S. Open champion
Murray of Britain 8-10 in career meetings. It’ll be the third
time the pair will meet in London this season. Federer topped
the third-ranked Scot in July to clinch a men’s record-extending
17th Grand Slam title at Wimbledon, while Murray beat him a
month later for the gold medal at the  London  Olympics.  Serbia’s Djokovic, who won group A yesterday after sweeping
all three of his matches,  has beaten Del Potro six times in
eight matches.  To contact the reporter on this story:
