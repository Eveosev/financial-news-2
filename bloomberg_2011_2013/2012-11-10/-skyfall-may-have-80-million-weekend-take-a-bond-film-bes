“Skyfall,” the latest James Bond
thriller from  Sony Corp. (6758)  and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., may set a
record for the film franchise with receipts in the U.S. and
Canada totaling as much as $80 million this weekend,
Hollywood.com Box-Office said.  The  film  earned $30.8 million yesterday, including $2.4
million in midnight showings, the box-office tracker said today
in an e-mailed statement. Sales outside the U.S. and Canada for
“Skyfall” are $347 million as of Nov. 8, Hollywood.com said.  “Quantum of Solace,” released in November 2008, holds the
record for the best-ever Bond opening with $67.5 million. That
movie earned $27 million in Friday showings.  The latest film features Daniel Craig as the MI-6 operative
Bond,  Javier Bardem  as the villain and  Judi Dench  as agency
chief M.  Craig, who took over the role in 2006’s “Casino Royale,”
has won critical praise in addition to box-office success.
“Skyfall” had a 93 percent positive rating from critics, based
on reviews, according to Rottentomatoes.com.  To contact the reporter on the story:
