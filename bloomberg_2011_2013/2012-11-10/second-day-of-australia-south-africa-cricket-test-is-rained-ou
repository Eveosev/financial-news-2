The second day of the opening
cricket Test between Australia and  South Africa  was rained out
in Brisbane.  Play never began yesterday at the Gabba and was officially
called off at 4 p.m. local time after an inspection by the
umpires.  South Africa, the No. 1 team in the International Cricket
Council Test rankings, will resume on 255-2, with Hashim Amla an
unbeaten 90 and  Jacques Kallis  84 not out. The duo became the
Proteasâ€™ greatest scoring partnership on day one by pushing
their run total to 3,607.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
