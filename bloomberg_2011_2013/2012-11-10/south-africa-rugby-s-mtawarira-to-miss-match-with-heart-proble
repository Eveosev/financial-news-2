South Africa  prop Tendai Mtawarira
will miss today’s international rugby Test match against Ireland
after suffering mild heart palpatations.  Mtawarira, 27, was released from a Dublin hospital after
being admitted this morning for observation, the South African
Rugby Union said in a statement. A decision on his participation
in the rest of the Springboks’ tour will be made at a later
date.  CJ van der Linde will replace Mtawarira in the starting
lineup at Aviva Stadium. Heinke van der Merwe will take van der
Linde’s spot on the bench.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
