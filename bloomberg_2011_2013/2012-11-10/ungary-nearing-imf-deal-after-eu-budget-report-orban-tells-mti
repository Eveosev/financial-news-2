Hungary  is nearing an aid deal with
the  International Monetary Fund  and the European Union after the
European Commission forecast this week that the budget gap would
stay within the bloc’s 3 percent of output limit in 2012 and
2013, MTI said, citing an interview with Premier  Viktor Orban .  “In the past two months we made huge strides towards an
IMF-EU agreement,” Orban said today, according to the state
news service. “By now it’s obvious that Hungary’s budgets in
2012 and 2013 are okay. We consider that the biggest obstacles
blocking an aid deal have now been removed.”  The IMF, which has urged Hungary to implement pro-growth
policies instead of ad hoc measures aimed at plugging budget
holes, has no date set to continue aid talks which Hungary
requested one year ago, Gerry Rice, a spokesman for the
Washington-based lender, said Nov. 1. The EU forecast Hungary’s
shortfall would breach the bloc’s limit in 2014.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
