Top Burgundies including Henri Jayer
and Romanee-Conti led the bidding at a Christie’s International
Plc wine sale in  London  this week which raised a total of 1.2
million pounds ($1.9 million).  A 12-bottle case of Vosne-Romanee 1er Cru Cros Parantoux
Henri Jayer from 1999 sold to an Asian private client for 48,300
pounds including fees, more than its presale estimate, according
to Christie’s. Six bottles of  Romanee-Conti Domaine de la
Romanee-Conti  from between 1998 and 2004 fetched 46,000 pounds
while a half-case of Romanee-Conti 1997 DRC Grand Cru sold for 
43,700 pounds.  This week’s sales, including another Christie’s event in
Amsterdam, came after wine auctions by the five largest houses
reached $34 million last month, according to their websites. The
London-based Liv-ex 100 wine index fell 0.6 percent in October,
taking its decline this year to 9.8 percent. The index, mostly
Bordeaux along with some from Burgundy, the Rhone, Italy and
Champagne, rose in September after declines earlier in the year.  Following are auction results this year from the five
biggest houses: New York-based Acker Merrall & Condit Company
Inc., Christie’s, based in London,  Sotheby’s (BID) , with its
headquarters in  New York ,  Hart Davis Hart Wine Co.  of Chicago
and Zachys in  White Plains , New York. Internet-only auctions
aren’t included.  Links on auction-house names are to results or catalogs on
