Germany ’s government bonds rose for
a third week as data showed the economic slowdown is spreading
to  Europe ’s largest economies, underpinning the case for the
region’s central bank to cut interest rates to boost growth.  Ten-year bund  yields  dropped to the lowest level in two
months yesterday as data showed industrial production slumped in
France, Italy and  Finland . European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the euro-area economy was expected to “remain
weak” after policy makers kept the main refinancing  rate  at a
record low of 0.75 percent on Nov. 8. German two-year note
yields were below zero every day this week. Spain’s bonds fell
as optimism waned that the nation will ask for a bailout.  “The data, particularly industrial production, was
disappointing, which is causing concern that Germany is being
dragged down toward recession,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-
income strategist at RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh.
“Accordingly, 10-year yields have dropped.”  The yield on Germany’s  10-year bund  fell 10 basis points,
or 0.10 percentage point, this week to 1.35 percent at 5 p.m.
London time yesterday, after declining to 1.31 percent, the
lowest since Aug. 31. The 1.5 percent bund due in September 2022
gained 0.935, or 9.35 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,272) face amount,
to 101.39.  Two-year yields declined four basis points to minus 0.033
percent. A negative yield means investors who hold the security
until it matures will receive less than they paid to buy it.  Output Data  French industrial production shrank 2.5 percent in
September from a year earlier, after slipping 0.9 percent in
August, the national statistics office said yesterday. Factory
output slid 4.8 percent in  Italy  and 1.7 percent in Finland,
reports showed. In Germany, production dropped 1.2 percent from
a year earlier when adjusted for working days.  A euro-area report due next week is forecast to confirm the
region’s economy slipped into another recession in the third
quarter.  Gross domestic product  in the 17-member euro area fell 0.1
percent in the second quarter, after sliding 0.2 percent in the
first three months of the year, data from the European Union’s
statistics office will show Nov. 15, according to the median
prediction of 44 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Spain’s 10-year yields climbed 16 basis points this week to
5.82 percent, while similar-maturity Italian rates were three
basis points higher at 4.97 percent. Spanish yields have
increased for the past three weeks as the nation’s government
refrained from asking for financial assistance from the ECB’s
Outright Monetary Transactions program.  Germany is scheduled to sell 5 billion euros of two-year
notes on Nov. 14, while  France  will auction securities maturing
between 2014 and 2017, as well as inflation-linked bonds due
from 2016 to 2027 on Nov. 15.  German bonds returned 4 percent this year through Nov. 8,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish securities
gained 2.1 percent, while Italy’s earned 17 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
