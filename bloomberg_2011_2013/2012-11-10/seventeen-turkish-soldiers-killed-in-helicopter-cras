A Turkish army helicopter crashed
into rocks while attempting to land in the southeastern province
of Siirt, killing 13 elite commandos and four crew members,
according to provincial Governor Ahmet Aydin.  The crash happened in foggy weather near the town of
Pervari, Aydin said today in a phone interview. The soldiers
were chasing Kurdish militants in the area, he said.  The Turkish army relies heavily on helicopters to deploy
troops in the southeast as it fights against autonomy-seeking
militants from the Kurdistan Workers’ Party or PKK. The military
killed 42 PKK militants over past three days near the country’s
border with  Iraq , Hurriyet reported earlier today, citing
unidentified Turkish officials.  The air strikes by warplanes and helicopters against
militants near town of Semdinli in Hakkari province followed the
death of a soldier death in a clash with the PKK on Nov. 7, the
Turkish newspaper reported.  The PKK, which use bases in northern Iraq to stage cross-
border attacks, has been designated a terrorist group by  Turkey ,
the U.S. and the European Union. The conflict has left some
40,000 people dead since 1984.  To contact the reporter on this story:
