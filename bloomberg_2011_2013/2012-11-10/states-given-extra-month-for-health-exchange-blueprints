President  Barack Obama ’s
administration gave U.S. states one more month to decide how
they plan to develop new health exchanges that will let people
shop for insurance coverage.  While the states still must say by Nov. 16 if they plan to
build their own marketplaces, they can now wait until Dec. 14 to
submit the actual blueprint, Health and Human Services Secretary
 Kathleen Sebelius  said in a letter sent yesterday to state
governors. States that want to create a partnership with the
federal government to manage the exchanges have until Feb. 15 to
outline the duties they’ll handle.  All but 13 governors  had taken  a wait-and-see approach on
the exchanges, which are supposed to be running by 2014 as one
of the requirements in Obama’s overhaul of the health-care
system. Governors who miss the deadline will turn over to the
federal government most authority to decide which insurers can
sell plans to their state residents.  “The administration is committed to providing significant
flexibility for building a marketplace that best meets your
state’s needs,” Sebelius said in the letter.  Thirty-four states have accepted at least two grants from
the federal government to start planning an exchange, according
to Sebelius’s department. That puts about 20 states in a
position to build an exchange or partner with the federal
government on one, in addition to the 13, plus the  District of
Columbia , who have already said they’ll run their own.  The federal exchange will also control enrollment of low-
income people into state Medicaid programs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
