(Corrects to remove reference to GCC’s only elected
parliament in 2nd paragraph of story first published yesterday.)  Kuwait’s government should revoke a
“ban” it placed on peaceful assembly,  Human Rights Watch  said,
one day ahead of a planned protest against changes to the Gulf
state’s election law.  The third-biggest oil producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries is holding celebrations today to
mark the 50th anniversary of its constitution.  “The right to peaceful assembly is enshrined in the
constitution Kuwaitis will be celebrating,”  Joe Stork , deputy
 Middle East  director at the New York-based rights group, said in
an e-mailed statement. “Authorities should lift the ban and
permit people to express their views.”  Kuwait’s political opposition staged several demonstrations
and is boycotting elections set for Dec. 1 to protest a
government-imposed change to the election law. The new
amendment, which the opposition considers an attempt to reduce
their representation in parliament, allows each citizen to vote
for only one candidate, instead of four as previously permitted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
