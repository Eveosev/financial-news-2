Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS)  workers
rejected a one-time payment to end an unofficial eight-week
strike in South Africa that has halted production of about a
fifth of global platinum output.  Management proposed a payment of 4,500 rand ($517),
comprising 2,000 rand for employees who didn’t strike or who
have “financial difficulties,” and 2,500 rand to be paid two
weeks after work resumes notwithstanding further incidents. The
offer, which will cost the world’s largest platinum producer 220
million rand, was contingent on employees returning by Nov. 12,
Johannesburg-based company known as Amplats said yesterday.  “The strike is carrying on,” Evans Ramokga, a worker
representative, said by phone from Rustenburg, northwest of
Johannesburg, where the strikers staged a peaceful rally today.
“We want salary increases. How can the company talk about going
back to work without workers’ demands being adhered to?”  Amplats, which fired 12,000 workers at its Rustenburg
operations on Oct. 5, has said the demand of workers for a
salary increase of 4,500 rand a month would cost about 2.6
billion rand and is unaffordable. Management reopened
discussions with unions and representatives on Nov. 7 after
previously offering a one-time payment of 2,000 rand if workers
returned by Oct. 30 and promising to reinstate the 12,000.  Mpumi Sithole, a spokeswoman for Amplats, and Lesiba
Seshoka, a spokesman for the National Union of Mineworkers, both
said they were unaware of the workers’ decision and couldn’t
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
