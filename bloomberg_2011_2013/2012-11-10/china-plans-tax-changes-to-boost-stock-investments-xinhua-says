China plans to stimulate its stock
markets by announcing bigger  tax deductions  on dividends for
long-term investors, the Xinhua News Agency reported, citing the
China Securities Regulatory Commission.  “The tax policy will guide investors to holding stocks for
the long term, and companies paying high dividends will attract
more attention in the market,” the agency  reported  today,
citing an unidentified CSRC spokesperson.  The CSRC said today that authorities have agreed to add 200
billion yuan ($32 billion) to the existing 70 billion-yuan quota
for the nation’s local-currency  renminbi  qualified foreign
institutional investor program and loosen restrictions because
of “strong demand” from overseas investors. Capital inflows
under foreign institutional investor programs have recently
accelerated, Xinhua reported, citing the commission.  The CSRC will announce new measures shortly to lower
securities brokerages’ capital requirements and expand the scope
of their proprietary trading, the official  news agency  said.  --Zhang Dingmin. Editors: Dylan Griffiths, Christopher Scinta.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
