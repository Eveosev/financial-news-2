U.K. government bonds rose for a
third week as reports showing a decline in industrial production
and service activity fueled speculation the central bank will
need to increase asset purchases to spur growth.  Benchmark  10-year yields  fell to the lowest level in two
months as the  Bank of England  said it would transfer income from
gilts it holds under its bond-buying program to the Treasury to
reduce the nation’s debt burden. The central bank left its
target for asset purchases, known as quantitative easing, at 375
billion pounds ($597 billion) at its Nov. 7-8 policy meeting.
The pound dropped for a second week against the dollar.  “The data has been pretty poor this week and we feel that
an expansion of QE isn’t too far away,” said Jamie Searle, a
rates strategist at Citigroup Inc. in  London . “If the data
continues in this vein, gilts are likely to benefit.”  The U.K. 10-year yield fell 12 basis points, or 0.12
percentage point, this week to 1.74 percent, the biggest drop
since the period ended Sept. 21. The yield declined to 1.67
percent yesterday, the least since Sept. 10. The 1.75 percent
bond due in September 2022 rose 1.08, or 10.80 pounds per 1,000-
pound face amount, to 100.135.  The Treasury plans to use the income from the bonds it
bought under its asset-purchase plan to reduce the stock of
outstanding debt, lowering the amount of gilts held by the
private sector and increasing the amount of money in the
economy, Governor  Mervyn King  wrote in a letter to Chancellor of
the Exchequer  George Osborne  published yesterday.  ‘Positive Action’  “All in all the announcement is clearly a positive action
for the gilt market,” Citigroup’s Searle said. Gilt issuance is
likely to be lower in the near-term, he said.  U.K. industrial output plunged 1.7 percent in September,
after falling 0.5 percent in August, the  Office for National
Statistics  said Nov. 6. A gauge of the service industry based on
a survey of  purchasing managers  fell to a 22-month low of 50.6
in October, Markit Economics and the  Chartered Institute of
Purchasing and Supply  said Nov. 5.  The Bank of England will announce its quarterly growth and
inflation forecasts on Nov. 14. The government will release data
for consumer prices on Nov. 13 and retail sales on Nov. 15.  Gilts returned 3.2 percent this year through Nov. 8,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds gained
4 percent and Treasuries rose 2.7 percent.  Sterling fell 0.7 percent this week to $1.5912 after
falling 0.5 percent the previous week. The U.K. currency gained
0.2 percent to 79.91 pence per euro.  The pound has advanced 0.9 percent in the past three months
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-market currencies. The euro gained 2.7 percent and
the dollar dropped 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
