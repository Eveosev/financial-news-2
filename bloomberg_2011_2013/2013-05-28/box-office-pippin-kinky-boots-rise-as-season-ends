Broadway’s 2012-13 season finished
strong as “Kinky Boots,” “Motown” and “Pippin” had their
bestselling weeks thanks to an influx of Memorial Day weekend
tourists.  As projected last week by  Bloomberg News , the season came
up short in attendance, dropping more than 6 percent since 2011-2012.  “Kinky Boots,” with songs by Cyndi Lauper, gained 8
percent and “Motown” jumped 10 percent as each sold $1.4
million. Both new musicals played at near capacity, according to
figures released by the trade association the  Broadway League .  “Pippin,” a favorite in the musical-revival category at
the Tony Awards on June 9, rose 8 percent to $935,000. Rival
“Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Cinderella,” which is at a larger
theater, rose 5 percent to $1.1 million.  Christopher Durang’s poignant comedy “Vanya and Sonia and
Masha and Spike,” starring  Sigourney Weaver , rose for the
fourth consecutive week, to $591,000.  Broadway shows sold $1.14 billion of tickets during the
season, down 0.1 percent from 2011-2012. (As tabulated by the
League, both the week and season ended May 26.) Attendance was
off 6 percent. In a release, the League in part blamed the
effects of  Hurricane Sandy . It predicted that “numbers will
return to previous season highs.”  ‘Lucky’ Tom  “Lucky Guy” with  Tom Hanks  hit a ceiling, grossing $1.4
million, little changed from the previous week. One of the
highest-grossing limited runs, it’s set to close on July 3.  Alan Cumming ’s virtually one-man “Macbeth” (two other
actors play some supporting characters) had the worst of its
seven weeks. It fell 22 percent to $349,000, half its potential.  The Scottish thane fared better than the salty Texan:
Holland Taylor’s one-woman show about Governor Ann Richards,
“Ann” continues at less than 25 percent of
box-office potential. It dropped 2 percent to $240,000.  The more things change, the more “The Book of Mormon”
wins. It had its third highest-grossing week since previews
began in February 2011, selling $1.8 million.  Muse highlights include  Craig Seligman  on books and N.Y.
