A coalition of 100 executives,
lawyers and academics called on  Spain ’s political class to limit
the power of senior party officials who have been dogged by
corruption scandals.  The group, headed by a former ambassador to the U.K.,
Carles Casajuana, a former head of European fixed income at
Merrill Lynch, Cesar Molinas, and  London School  of Economics
professor  Luis Garicano , called for a new law to establish an
external regulator for parties. Political groups should be
forced to publish audited accounts, hold secret ballots for
officials and impose  term limits  on those chosen to key
positions such as party treasurer, they said.  “Corruption happens everywhere, but in Spain the system
isn’t capable of regenerating and eliminating cases of
corruption,” Garicano said at a news conference in Madrid
today. “The countries that grow aren’t the ones with oil or
natural resources, but the ones that have solid institutions.”  Spain’s two main political parties have seen their support
plummet as they’ve been immersed in allegations that officials
exploited their positions to enrich themselves even as
successive administrations plunged the country into an economic
crisis that has left 6 million unemployed.  The group aims to collect 500,000 signatures and ask
parliament to draw up a new law for political parties. Their
proposals draw on German legislation.  “This is the first step in a long march,” Molinas said.
“Spain should be inspired by how the countries around us
work.”  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
