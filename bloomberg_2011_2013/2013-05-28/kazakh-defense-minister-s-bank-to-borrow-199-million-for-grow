Tsesnabank, the Kazakh lender
controlled by Defense Minister Adilbek Zhaksybekov, may sell as
much as 30 billion tenge ($199 million) of debt this year,
including subordinated bonds, to fund expansion.  The Astana-based bank wants to boost assets to as much as
750 billion tenge in 2013, Chief Executive Officer Dauren Zhaksybek told reporters in Almaty today. Tsesnabank has exceed
its 695 billion-tenge target for this year’s asset growth,
compared with 618 billion tenge in 2012, he said.  “So far active growth in the first quarter was shown only
by us and Sberbank,” Zhaksybek said. “Predictions are
difficult to make because the market is a bit unstable.”  Kazakhstan’s seventh-largest bank is benefiting from a
lower level of provisioning, setting aside the equivalent of 3.6
percent of its credit portfolio against bad loans, central bank
data show. That compares with a 33 percent share by the
country’s 38 banks as of May 1, according to the central bank’s
financial oversight committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
