Nigeria  approved a shortlist of 11
companies bidding for two state-owned power utilities, the
National Council on Privatization said.  Four bidders were pre-qualified for Afam Power Plc and
seven others for Kaduna Distribution Co., the Abuja-based
privatization council said in an e-mailed statement.  Interested buyers for the power companies “would be
invited to the financial bid opening stage after the submission
of the required post-qualification security,” said Chigbo
Anichebe, a spokesman for the privatization council.  Nigeria, Africa’s top oil producer, is selling majority
stakes in six power-generation and 11 distribution companies
spun out of the former state utility as it seeks private
investment to curb frequent blackouts. So far, five state-owned
 power plants  and 10 power-distribution companies have been sold.  The privatization council also pre-qualified three
companies to wind down state-owned Nigerian Telecommunications
Ltd., also known as Nitel.  The West  Africa  nation halted the sale of Nitel in 2010 and
opted to liquidate the company after it failed to find a buyer
for the former monopoly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
