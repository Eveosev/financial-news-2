European stocks  advanced, with the
Stoxx  Europe  600 Index climbing the most in more than a month,
as U.S. and U.K. markets reopened following a public holiday.  AstraZeneca (AZN)  Plc rose to its highest price since 2006 after
the U.K.’s second-biggest drugmaker agreed to buy Omthera
Pharmaceuticals Inc. for $323 million. Victrex Plc climbed to
the highest price since its initial public offering in 1995.
Aixtron SE jumped 7.8 percent after Natixis recommended buying
the maker of equipment for the semiconductor industry.  The Stoxx 600 increased 1.3 percent to 308.23 at the close
of trading, extending its rally this month to 3.9 percent. The
gauge has climbed for 12 consecutive months, its longest winning
streak since 1997. The equity benchmark has  rallied 10 percent 
so far in 2013, its best start to a year since 1998, as central
banks around the world maintained a combination of monetary
stimulus and low  interest rates .  “Private investors are reducing their large cash position
in favor of equities,” said Andreas Nigg, head of equity and
commodity strategy at Vontobel Asset Management in Zurich. “We
could be at a bottom and inflection point with regards to
economic releases from Europe.”  European stocks extended gains after a report from the
Conference Board showed that U.S.  consumer confidence  rose to
76.2 in May, the highest level since February 2008. Economists
had predicted that the measure would advance to 71.2.  Property Prices  In a separate release, the S&P/Case-Shiller  house-price
index  gained 1.1 percent in March, compared with the 1 percent
average projection of economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
That means  house prices  have climbed  10.9 percent  from a year
earlier, their biggest jump since April 2006.  “We continue to see a large risk appetite,” said Martin Schlatter, a  fund manager  at Swiss Rock Asset Management AG in
Zurich, which oversees about 1 billion Swiss francs ($1.03
billion). “Many investors have been missing the rally in equity
markets and are waiting for an entry. Last week’s slump didn’t
create a fundamentally new situation. Stocks are still
significantly more attractive than bonds.”  National benchmark indexes rose in every western-European
market except for Greece and Iceland. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 surged
1.6 percent.  France ’s CAC 40 rose 1.4 percent and  Germany ’s DAX
advanced 1.2 percent.  AstraZeneca climbed 2.7 percent to 3,521.5 pence. The
company agreed to buy the U.S. developer of an experimental
treatment for patients with high levels of triglycerides, a
contributory factor to heart attacks and strokes. AstraZeneca’s
cholesterol-lowering drug, Crestor, will face competition from
generic treatments in the U.S. from 2016.  Victrex, Aixtron  Victrex (VCT)  surged 8.4 percent to 1,765 pence. The U.K. maker
of heat-resistant plastics for the auto, energy and health-care
industries raised its interim dividend by 15 percent to 10.35
pence per share. Revenue climbed 1 percent in the first half to
106.4 million pounds ($160 million) from a year earlier.  Aixtron jumped 7.8 percent to 13.57 euros, its highest
price in more than a year. Natixis raised the stock to buy from
neutral, citing a rebounding LED industry that the company
should benefit from.  Cie. Financiere Richemont SA, the owner of the Cartier
brand, added 3 percent to 91.65 francs.  Switzerland ’s watch
exports increased 5.7 percent in April from a year earlier, the
country’s Federal Customs Offices said today.  Seadrill Gains  Seadrill Ltd. (SDRL)  climbed 2.1 percent to 241.10 kroner. The
offshore drilling company controlled by billionaire  John
Fredriksen  said earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization amounted to $713 million in the first quarter.
That exceeded the  average analyst estimate  of $609 million.
Seadrill also raised its dividend to 88 cents from 86 cents.  Basilea Pharmaceutica (BSLN)  AG jumped 6.8 percent to 72.40 francs
after saying that the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  has
granted orphan-drug status for one of its treatments. The
designation gives Basilea the right to sell its drug without
competition for seven years and benefit from tax incentives.  Evraz Plc dropped 1.6 percent to 143.9 pence. Eurasian
Natural Resources Corp. declined 2.7 percent to 248 pence.  Telefonica Deutschland Holding AG fell 3.1 percent to 5.74
euros. Chief Executive Officer Rene Schuster ruled out a merger
with Royal KPN NV’s E-Plus wireless unit in Germany in the near
future, Handelsblatt reported, citing an interview.  Pfeiffer Vacuum Technology AG tumbled 18 percent to 79.99
euros, its biggest slide since at least 1998, after forecasting
full-year revenue of 420 million euros to 450 million euros.
That trailed the average analyst estimate of 461 million euros
for the maker of vacuum pumps.  “This slowdown in sales will affect our efforts to improve
profitability,” Chief Executive Officer Manfred Bender  said  at
an annual  shareholders’ meeting .  To contact the reporter on this story:
