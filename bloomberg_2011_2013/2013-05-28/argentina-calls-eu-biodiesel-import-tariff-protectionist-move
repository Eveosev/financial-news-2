Argentina  called the European Union’s
decision to impose tariffs on its biodiesel an act of
protectionism meant to close the market off to “more efficient
producers.”  The  statement , published today on the Foreign Ministry’s
website, follows the 27-nation bloc’s  decision  to impose duties
on Argentinian and Indonesian exporters of biodiesel for
allegedly selling the fuel below cost, a practice known as
dumping.  “The measure is due to the inability of European producers
to compete with more efficient producers,” the Foreign Ministry
said in the statement. It is a “protectionist decision that
lacks technical justification.”  EU producers including  Verbio AG (VBK)  in Germany, Diester
Industrie SAS in France and Novaol Srl in Italy suffered
“material injury” as a result of dumped imports from Argentina
and Indonesia, the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc’s
trade authority in Brussels, said today in the Official Journal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
