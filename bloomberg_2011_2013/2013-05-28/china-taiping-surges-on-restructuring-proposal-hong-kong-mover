China Taiping Insurance Holdings Co.,
the first overseas-listed Chinese insurer, soared the most in
more than four-and-a-half years after saying it would buy 10.6
billion  yuan  ($1.7 billion) of assets from its parent.  The shares  jumped  15 percent to HK$14.20 at the close in
Hong Kong trading, the biggest advance since October 2008. The
stock was the  best performer  on the MSCI China Index.  Under the deal, China Taiping will issue 862.7 million
shares at HK$15.39 apiece to pay for unlisted assets from parent
China Taiping Insurance Group Co. The restructuring will help
the insurer consolidate its business in China and capture growth
potential, Deutsche Bank AG analyst Esther Chwei wrote in a
report today.  “The transaction will have minimal dilution impact on
minority shareholders, which should alleviate market concerns,”
wrote Chwei, who maintained a buy recommendation on the stock.  Standard Chartered Bank analysts led by Hong Kong-based
Jennifer Law upgraded the stock to outperform from in-line and
raised the price target to HK$25.20 from HK$18.10, noting that
the transaction price is “much lower” than the bank’s and
market expectations.  “With the overhang from the company’s restructuring
finally removed, stronger-than-peers growth prospects, and the
limited downside risk on the prudent assumptions, we see a
compelling buy case for  China  Taiping,” the analysts wrote in a
report today.  China Taiping Insurance Holdings said April 19 it may
acquire assets from its parent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
