Australia ’s global share of new
contracts for liquefied natural gas may drop to about 10 percent
a year by 2025 as U.S. exports rise, Wood Mackenzie Ltd. said.  Buyers may get 16 million to 20 million metric tons of LNG
annually from Australian suppliers out of the extra 160 million
tons a year that’s estimated to be needed to satisfy 2025
demand,  Gavin Thompson  and Andrew McManus, Wood Mackenzie
consultants, said yesterday in an interview in Brisbane.  While Australia is forecast to surpass Qatar as the world’s
largest exporter of LNG by the end of the decade with almost
A$200 billion ($193 billion) of projects going ahead, it’s
facing increasing competition from  North America  and  East
Africa . A planned A$100 billion of new plants is now in doubt
unless the industry reduces costs, the Australian Petroleum
Production & Exploration Association said.  “It’s a great opportunity for suppliers because demand is
strong,” said Thompson, the Beijing-based principal consultant
for Asia-Pacific gas and power. “But if you really consider
every project, not all are going to go ahead.”  Suppliers worldwide are planning projects to produce more
than 200 million tons of LNG a year and “chasing” the 160
million tons of gas that may be contracted for 2025, said
McManus, vice president of energy consulting for Australasia.
LNG buyers are forecast to get about 50 million tons a year from
the U.S. between 2020 and 2025, according to Thompson.  Australia is expected to contribute about 25 percent of
global LNG supply by 2018,  Wood Mackenzie ’s McManus said
yesterday in a presentation at an industry conference. Further
opportunities for Australian projects will probably be in
floating LNG and expansion of existing developments, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
