Bayern Munich , which won the
 Champions League  title four days ago, has ousted  Manchester
United  from first place in brand value, according to a survey of
the world’s top soccer teams.  Brand Finance Plc gave Bayern a brand valuation of 668
million euros ($860 million), up 8 percent from last year, the
company said in an e-mailed statement, citing its annual report.
Manchester United, which won a record 20 English league titles,
fell to second place with a brand estimated at 650 million
euros.  “Bayern Munich is still very much a story of domestic
dominance, however its continued presence in the Champions
league has provided the club with access to a global audience,”
Dave Chattaway, London-based Brand Finance’s Head of Sports
Valuation, said in the statement. “The challenge now for all
Bundesliga clubs and the league itself, is to see if they can
export their domestic brand strength into global
opportunities.”  Bayern took the top spot thanks to “impressive financials
and a growing international reputation for quality football,”
Brand Finance said.  Spain ’s Real Madrid was third at 482 million
euros, Barcelona fourth at 444 million euros and Chelsea fifth
at 325 million euros.  Bayern defeated  Borussia Dortmund  2:1 in the first all-German Champions League final on May 25 in  London . Arjen Robben’s goal in the 89th minute gave Bayern its fifth title in
 Europe ’s elite club competition and came after two losses in the
past three finals.  Runner-Up  Runner-up Dortmund, which finished second in the German
Bundesliga and won its only Champions League title in 1997,
climbed one spot to 10th after its brand value grew 13 percent
to 202 million euros, passing by domestic rival Schalke at 201
million euros.  “The cheap tickets, high attendances, democratic ownership
structure and financial prudence of the Bundesliga now looks
like an attractive alternative,” to the Premier League, Brand
Finance CEO David Haigh said in the statement. “Just as British
politicians and business journalists have long been calling for
our economy to emulate the German Mittelstand, now sports
commentators are wondering whether we can learn from the
Bundesliga.”  Germany ’s  Adidas AG (ADS)  supplies 18 of the Top 50 teams with
uniforms, while  Nike Inc. (NKE)  follows with 14 deals in a “hotly
contested and increasingly lucrative marketplace,” Brand
Finance said.  Manchester  Manchester’s brand value dropped 3 percent amid a
“truncated European campaign” and the departure of  Alex Ferguson , who this month retired after having led the club to 38
trophies in 26 years.  While the Bundesliga is making strides, the combined brand
value for its teams in Brand Finance’s Top 50 is 1.4 billion
euros, compared with 2.4 billion euros for the U.K. teams in the
study.  “Fussball may be coming home, but the Bundesliga still has
a way to go before it is can mount a real challenge to the
global allure of Premier League,” Brand Finance said.  *T Top 25 clubs by brand value (millions of euros):
