The Japanese currency’s recent
strengthening is part of a broader correction that shouldn’t
deter investors from selling the yen, Greg Gibbs, a senior
currency strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, said in
a Bloomberg TV interview with  Susan Li  from  Singapore .  On yen outlook:  “I still view this as largely a correction of a broader
trend, perhaps even a healthy correction, and I’d even be
advising clients that these are right levels to start looking at
selling” the yen.  On the JGB ‘bubble’:  “The BOJ is still buying an enormous amount of these
bonds, so we should presume that, over the period ahead, we
should expect low real yields in Japan for a long period of time
and that will support the economic growth.”  On rising JGB yields:  “As long as the economy is growing and tax revenues are
being raised, earnings at banks and other companies are higher,
that can compensate for any losses that may be occurring from
holdings of JGBs.”  “It is important that along with the rising yields we get
an improving economic outlook. That is happening and I think it
will continue to happen and that’s why this isn’t going to
derail the policy measures which are being implemented by the
government and the BOJ and we’ll continue to see, all together,
we’ll see rising equity markets, we’ll see rising yields in
 Japan  and we’ll see the currency weakening all at the same
time.”  On the direction of yen:  “We could go back to the key technical levels around the
last payrolls figure around 99.40.”  “These are the right levels to already start getting back
into those trades. We’ve probably cleaned out some of the
speculative long positions in both the Nikkei and the yen and
we’re starting to stabilize here and the market will be looking
to see how we trade in the coming sessions, but I’d be advising
these are the right levels, around 101, to be looking at buying
dollar-yen again.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
