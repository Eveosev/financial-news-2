A Turkish port serving  Iraq ,  Libya 
and  Iran  is planning to sell bonds, taking advantage of record-low  interest rates  to pay off debt and expand as the nation’s
trade with the Middle East booms.  The Mersin port company applied to sell as much as $600
million in bonds, according to a statement to the Borsa Istanbul
on May 27. The sale may lower the company’s financing costs as
the average yield on Turkish corporate debt fell 135 basis
points over the past year to 4.24 percent on May 24, according
to JPMorgan Chase & Co. indexes. That compares with an average
5.03 percent for emerging-market companies, the data show.  Turkey’s  Akfen Holding AS (AKFEN)  and PSA International Pte. of
Singapore own equal stakes in the port on Turkey’s Mediterranean
coast, the country’s largest after Istanbul and Izmir. While
trade with  Europe  slows, commerce with the  Middle East  jumped 39
percent in 2012, data from the state statistics agency showed.
Mersin is the most profitable and most indebted of Akfen’s
business units, according to the holding company.  “We want to improve the conditions on this debt,” Akfen
Chief Executive Officer Suha Gucsar said by telephone on May 27.
“We are investing in a new port on the seaside that will accept
bigger vessels and we’ll use some of those proceeds for
investment.”  Winning Bid  Akfen and PSA bid $755 million at a government auction in
2005 for the port, called Mersin Uluslararasi Liman
Isletmeciligi AS. Mersin reported a 35 percent increase in
revenue to 252.5 million liras ($136 million) last year,
according to a presentation on its website. Its ratio of
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
to revenue was 60 percent, based on the report.  “Mersin port is a very profitable organization,” Isik Okte, chief strategist at Halk Invest, the investment unit for
state-run  Turkiye Halk Bankasi AS (HALKB) , said by e-mail yesterday.
“Port operations are a very lucrative business in growth areas,
and volume has picked up significantly in terms of trade
there.”  Genel Energy (GENL) , a Turkish energy company listed in  London ,
began trucking crude oil into the country from the Kurdistan
region in northern Iraq this year, storing it at a facility in
Mersin, Chief Executive Officer  Tony Hayward  said in January.
Genel plans to complete a pipeline from the region to Turkey
this year, Hayward said in April.  Oil Trade  Oil exports from the Kurdish region to Turkey may climb to
2 million barrels by 2019 from about 250,000 barrels this year,
the region’s oil minister  Ashti Hawrami  said last month.  Mersin aims to be “the port operator of choice in the east
Mediterranean” with rail and highway links to Syria, Iraq and
Iran, according to a mission statement on the company’s website.  “Libya now is the top destination for exports from Mersin
port, including anything from construction material to carpets
and food as the country is being rebuilt,” Ali Serdar Kocaoglu,
general manager of OSF International Logistics Services Foreign
Trade Co. in Mersin, said by telephone on May 28. “It is so
intense that ships often wait one or two days off the Libyan
ports of Tripoli, Benghazi and Misrate to unload.”  Mersin had 519 million liras of debt at the end of last
year, according to the group’s financial results for the 2012
fiscal year published on the company’s website on April 4. Akfen
also owns airport operator  TAV Havalimanlari Holding AS (TAVHL) , ferries
in Istanbul and property and construction companies, based on
the report.  Akfen’s  shares  have gained 20 percent this year in
Istanbul, compared with a 15 percent increase for the benchmark
Borsa ISE National 100 Index.  Debt Sales  Turkish companies have sold $24.3 billion in bonds this
year, almost double the $12.7 billion in the same period last
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The lira weakened 0.7 percent to 1.8587 per dollar at 6
p.m. in Istanbul yesterday. The  yield  on two-year lira-denominated sovereign debt rose three basis points to 5.26
percent, paring the drop in the past 12 months to 419 basis
points, or 4.19 percentage points, the biggest decline among
major  emerging markets  tracked by Bloomberg.  The extra  yield  investors demand to hold Turkish sovereign
debt in dollars over U.S. Treasuries rose four basis points to
186, compared with 197 for higher-rated  Brazil  and 191 for
 Russia , according to JPMorgan indexes. Turkey is rated Baa3, the
lowest investment grade, at Moody’s Investors Service. Brazil is
ranked one step higher and Russia two levels above Turkey.  Trading Partners  The European Union’s share in Turkey’s trade fell to 40.7
percent in March from 41.6 percent in the same month in 2012,
according to the latest available data from the statistics
agency. Exports to  Germany  declined to $1.15 billion, down 9.5
percent from the same a year earlier, the data show. While
Germany was Turkey’s top destination for trade, Iraq ranked
second with $932 million in exports.  “Turkey’s trading partners are changing and geopolitics is
key,” Halk Invest’s Okte said. “The EU’s share is declining
and the Middle East and  Africa  are gaining. As Turkey’s trading
partners shift, the Mersin port will gain even more.”  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
