small-company shares slumped on speculation this year’s rallies
were excessive.  China Vanke Co., the largest developer, surged 4.8 percent.

banks around the world spurred capital inflows and Chinese
policymakers accelerated reforms of the economy by allowing
private investment in industries such as telecommunications.  The Shanghai index trades at 9.5 times 12-month estimated
earnings, compared with a seven-year average of 15.7 times,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Trading volumes were 41

delayed, Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Leung wrote in a
report today. The government is targeting “more comprehensive”
market-based methods, they wrote. China will widen the tax
trials, the State Council said in a statement posted on the
central government’s website on May 24. Shanghai and Chongqing
have already started experimenting with property taxes.  “The impact of the tax won’t be big as it will only likely
be in several cities with limited tax rates,” Johnson Hu, a
Hong Kong-based property analyst at CIMB-GK Securities Research,
said in a phone interview today.  Brokerages Gain  A gauge of  financial stocks  including developers and
brokerages in the CSI 300 rose 2.9 percent. Still, the measure

in the past two weeks, while the price-earnings ratio for the
ChiNext index of start-ups trades at a two-year high of 56,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Small-company stocks “had gained a lot this year, so
there’s a risk of a bubble,” Deng Wenyuan, an analyst at
Soochow Securities Co., said by phone.  Sanan Optoelectronics retreated 5.1 percent to 19.95 yuan.
