Eolica Cateao SpA, a Chilean
renewable-energy developer, filed for permits to build a $224
million wind farm in the countryâ€™s Los Lagos region.  Work on the 100-megawatt Cateao project is expected to
start in March 2015, the Santiago-based company said in a filing
with the environmental licensing agency  Servicio de Evaluacion
Ambiental .  The wind project will be built in two 50-megawatt stages
and include a 26.6-kilometer (16.5-mile) power line, according
to the statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
