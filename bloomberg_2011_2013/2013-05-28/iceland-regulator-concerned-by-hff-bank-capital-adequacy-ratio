The Housing Finance Fund, Iceland’s
largest mortgage bank, faces growing risk over its declining
capital-adequacy ratio, the island’s  Financial Supervisory
Authority  said.  “The difficulties of the  fund  are significant and it’s
important that they will be resolved,” the Reykjavik-based
regulator said in an annual report published on its website.
“The capital-adequacy ratio of the fund has decreased over the
past semesters and it’s posed with a significant repayment risk,
especially under the current interest-rate regime.”  HFF, which provides mortgages linked to the inflation rate,
is losing business to commercial competitors such as Arion Banki
hf and  Islandsbanki hf , which are unfettered by such indexation.
As inflation hovers above 3 percent, borrowers have turned away
from HFF and sought alternative home loans to prevent their debt
burden from growing with consumer prices.  The bank’s capital ratio was 3.2 percent of its risk-weighted assets at the end of last year, compared with a 5
percent regulatory minimum, the fund said in March. HFF had $4
billion outstanding in bonds at the end of April.  Iceland, which let its biggest banks default on $85 billion
in 2008, said in February it would bail out the fund before it
became unable to honor its debts. That promise followed a
November pledge to inject 13 billion kronur ($105 million) into
state-backed HFF to keep the lender afloat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
