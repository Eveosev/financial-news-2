Ebos Group Ltd. will become the
largest pharmaceutical wholesaler in  Australia  and New Zealand
after agreeing a NZ$865 million ($700 million) takeover of
Australia’s Symbion Ltd.  Ebos will raise NZ$367 million in cash and issue NZ$498
million of shares to The Zuellig Group Inc., which owns Symbion,
the Christchurch-based company said in a statement. Ebos shares
are halted while an institutional share placement to raise NZ$90
million is conducted, while a 7-for-20 rights offer is also
proposed.  Zuellig will become a 40 percent shareholder in the
enlarged company, which will have forecast revenue of NZ$6.3
billion, based on pro-forma financial information contained in
the statement. That will make it the third-largest company by
sales in New Zealand. Ebos shares will be listed in Australia as
the company looks to expand in the nation with a population more
than five times that of New Zealand.  “We are bringing together two businesses that are very
well matched geographically and operationally and are leaders in
their segments in their respective markets,” Ebos Managing
Director Mark Waller said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
