The world could cut emissions by as
much as 19.8 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2020,
according to a  technical paper  published by the United Nations
Framework Convention on  Climate Change .  Potential for cuts include agriculture, where as much as
4.3 billion tons could be cut, and land use including forestry,
where as much as 4.2 billion tons be reduced, the secretariat of
the UN unit said in the report, published on its website today.  Submissions by countries “suggest that there are many
opportunities that could be employed and scaled up across a
range of thematic areas with a high mitigation potential prior
to 2020,” the UN secretariat said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
