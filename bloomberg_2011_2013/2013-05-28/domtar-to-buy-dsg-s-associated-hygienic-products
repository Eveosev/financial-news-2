Domtar Corp. (UFS) , the Canadian paper
maker that’s expanding into personal-care products, agreed to
pay $272 million for DSG International Ltd.’s Associated
Hygienic Products, a manufacturer of infant diapers.  The deal will close by the end of the second quarter,
Montreal-based Domtar said in a statement today. Domtar said it
expects to save $10 million within two years by integrating the
business with its personal-care segment, which already produces
Attends brand adult incontinence products.  Associated Hygienic Products is the largest U.S. maker of
store-brand infant diapers with factories in Ohio and  Texas ,
according to Domtar. The acquisition is the Canadian company’s
fourth personal-care deal in two years and will boost the
division’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization to an annualized $200 million by 2017, it said.  Personal care accounted for $111 million of Domtar’s
revenue in the first quarter while pulp and paper represented
$1.12 billion.  Domtar  rose  2.2 percent to C$72.23 at the close in Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
