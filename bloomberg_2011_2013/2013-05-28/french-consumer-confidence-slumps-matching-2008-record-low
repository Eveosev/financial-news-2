French consumer confidence
unexpectedly dropped, matching the record low it set in 2008, as
President  Francois Hollande â€™s tax increases hurt pruchasing
power and the economy returned to recession.  Household sentiment fell to 79 in May from a revised 83 in

median of 11 estimates gathered by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
