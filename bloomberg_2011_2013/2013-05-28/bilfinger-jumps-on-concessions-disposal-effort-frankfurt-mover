Bilfinger SE (GBF)  jumped the most in six
months after  Germany ’s second-biggest builder began the sale of
its concessions business, an infrastructure partner to the
public sector.  Bilfinger  climbed  as much as 3.9 percent, the steepest
intraday increase since November, to 80.85 euros and was trading
3.6 percent higher at 10:38 a.m. in  Frankfurt . That pushed the
stock up 10 percent this year, valuing the Mannheim-based
company at 3.7 billion euros ($4.8 billion). Volume was 98
percent of the three-month daily average.  “Business opportunities with other units of the company,
construction areas in particular, have declined significantly,”
Bilfinger said in an e-mailed statement after the market closed
yesterday.  Chief Executive Officer  Roland Koch  plans to turn Bilfinger
into a service provider, shifting away from its construction
past. The former prime minister of the German state of Hesse has
850 million euros available for acquisitions to help realize the
plan, which is intended to bring the company about 400 million
euros in net income in 2016.  The concessions unit, which delivers and operates transport
and social infrastructure projects as a private partner to the
public sector, had 143 employees at the end of 2012 and
generated 41 million euros in earnings before interest, taxes
and amortization that year, a 78 percent increase from 2011. The
number of the division’s projects in the period fell to 14 from
30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
