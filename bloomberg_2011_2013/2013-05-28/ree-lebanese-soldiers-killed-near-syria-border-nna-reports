Three Lebanese soldiers were killed
in a drive-by shooting at a checkpoint near  Syria , raising
concerns that the violent revolt against President Bashar al-Assad is further spreading across the border.  The unidentified gunmen escaped after opening fire today
from a car on the army roadblock in Arsal in the northeast, the
official Lebanese National News Agency reported, without saying
where it got the information.  The war in Syria between Assad, whose Alawite sect is a
branch of Shiite Islam, and the mainly Sunni rebels is raising
sectarian tensions in Lebanon. At least 23 people died in
clashes last week between Assad’s Shiite supporters and Sunni
Muslim opponents. And the leader of Lebanon’s militant Shiite
Hezbollah group,  Hassan Nasrallah , said his pro-Assad forces
were ready to jump deeper into the fray.  “Lebanon has already been drawn into the Syrian
conflict,” said Khalid al-Dhakhil, a politics professor at King
Saud University in Riyadh. “Hezbollah is already fighting in
Syria, and the Lebanese opposition is furious. Hezbollah knows
that without Assad it will lose its lifeline.”  Hezbollah, backed by  Iran  and classified as a terrorist
organization by the U.S. and  Israel , is fighting alongside
Syrian government forces to retake the city of Al-Qusair from
rebels. Syrian soldiers entered Al-Qusair this month to secure
the highway linking Damascus with the coastal mountain region
that forms the Alawite heartland, the regime’s support base, and
cut the rebel resupply lines from Lebanon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
