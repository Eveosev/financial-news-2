Boo Weekley and Matteo Manassero, who
won tournaments on the U.S. PGA and European PGA tours this past
weekend, are among 26 golfers added to the field for next
month’s U.S. Open.  A total of 78 players are now in the field for golf’s
second major championship of the season, scheduled for June
13-16 at Merion Golf Club in Ardmore,  Pennsylvania .  Of the 26 newly exempt players, 25 earned a spot by being
in the top 60 in the Official World Golf Ranking as of
yesterday.  Weekley captured the Crowne Plaza Invitational on May 26 at
Colonial Country Club in Fort Worth,  Texas , ending a five-year
wait for a third title on golf’s U.S. tour. The win vaulted
Weekley 56 spots to No. 55 in the rankings.  Italy’s Manassero earned his spot by winning the European
Tour’s BMW Championship on May 26, an event that awards an
automatic U.S. Open berth to its winner.  Among those players qualifying for the event through the
world rankings are 2011 U.S. Open runner-up Jason Day, and 2013
U.S. Tour winners Russell Henley, Billy Horschel and Kevin Streelman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
