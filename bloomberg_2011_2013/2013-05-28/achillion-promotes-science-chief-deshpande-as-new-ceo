Achillion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ACHN) , the
maker of experimental hepatitis C therapies, said the company’s
top scientist Milind Deshpande had been chosen to succeed
retiring Chief Executive Officer Michael Kishbauch.  Deshpande, also the president of research and development,
will take over after a three-month transition, Achillion said
today in a statement. He joined the  New Haven , Connecticut-based
company in 2001 and has been its top scientist since June 2007.
Kishbauch, CEO since July 2004, will remain a member of the
company’s board.  Achillion has three drugs in clinical testing for hepatitis
C, a liver disease estimated to affect 170 million people
worldwide. The company announced April 23 that one of the drugs,
ACH-3102, appeared effective in five out of eight patients,
reducing the amount of the liver-destroying virus in their
bloodstream to undetectable levels after 12 weeks of treatment.
It has started a 50-patient trial of the compound with its main
hepatitis drug, sovaprevir.  “I am humbled by the board’s decision and excited for the
opportunity to bring Achillion into late-stage clinical
development,” Deshpande said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
