The  Charlotte  Bobcats hired Los
Angeles Lakers assistant Steve Clifford to be the sixth coach
since 2007 of the National Basketball Association team, the
Associated Press reported.  Clifford has agreed to a three-year contract, AP said,
citing two people familiar with the situation that it didnâ€™t
identify. It will be his first head coaching job in the NBA, the
report said.  Clifford succeeds Mike Dunlap, who was fired after going
21-61 in his only season as coach of the Bobcats.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
