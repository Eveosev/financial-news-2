JMP Group Inc. (JMP) , the San Francisco-based investment bank, hired Charles Sweeney as its director of
trading.  Sweeney had been co-head of U.S. equity trading at Cantor
Fitzgerald & Co., JMP said today in a statement. He joined
Cantor last November after working at Susquehanna Financial
Group LLLP and Deutsche Bank AG.  Smaller investment banks and brokerages have struggled to
generate revenue as trading slowed. JMP, led by Chief Executive
Officer and co-founder Joe Jolson, posted a $1.7 million first-quarter loss, compared with net income of $0.4 million for the
first quarter of 2012, the firm reported earlier this month.  “Charlie is well-known on  Wall Street  and has a well-deserved reputation as a top trader in the financial services
space,” Mark Lehmann, president of JMP Securities, said in the
statement.  Sweeney declined to comment on his new job.  To contact the reporters on this story:
