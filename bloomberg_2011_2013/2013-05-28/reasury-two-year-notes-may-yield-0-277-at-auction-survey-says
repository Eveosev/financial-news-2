The Treasury Department’s $35 billion
sale of two-year notes may draw a  yield  of 0.277 percent,
according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
seven of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in May 2015, yielded 0.270
percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m.  New York 
time. The record auction low was 0.220 percent on July 24.  The size of today’s offering is the same as at the past 31
sales of two-year notes after peaking at $44 billion from
October 2009 through April 2010.  The April 23 offering’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
3.63, the most since January and up from 3.27 at the March sale.
The average for the past 10 auctions was 3.72.  Indirect bidders , a class of investor that includes foreign
central banks, bought 20.7 percent of the notes at the April
sale. The average for the past 10 auctions is 24.7 percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 27.7 percent of
the notes at the last sale, compared with an average of 24.5
percent at the past 10.  Two-year notes have gained 0.1 percent this year, versus a
loss of 0.5 percent for Treasuries overall, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes. The two-year securities returned
0.3 percent in 2012, while Treasuries overall rose 2.2 percent.  Today’s offering is the first of three note auctions this
week totaling $99 billion. The government will sell $35 billion
in five-year debt tomorrow and $29 billion in seven-year
securities on May 30. The Treasury sold $13 billion of 10-year
Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities on May 23.  The sales, including the TIPS offering last week, will
raise $53.54 billion of new cash, as maturing securities held by
the public total $58.46 billion, according to the  U.S. Treasury .  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to bid in Treasury auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
