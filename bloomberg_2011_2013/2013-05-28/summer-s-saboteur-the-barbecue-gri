It's summer, which means it's time for an American pastime: barbecue disasters. When confronting the charred echoes of a burger patty and the chorus of disavowals that comes with it, remember two truths: 1. Because every person who steps in front of a grill is an expert, the disaster is not his fault.  2. It is the fault of the grill. There are a million ways to blame a grill, including "You call yourself a grill!" It doesn't matter if it's gas or charcoal, both receive their fair share of finger pointing. And it shouldn't matter. Grilling, on a chemical level, is the same as any other heat-to-meat interaction, also known as the Maillard reaction: the meat browns, and tastes cooked. "The hotter the meat, the more Maillard end products-- those toasty, meaty, roasted notes-- you'll get," says Dr. Jane K. Parker of the Food and Nutritional Sciences department at the University of Reading, UK.  That also means it really doesn't matter where the heat is coming from, right? Not if you're a charcoal guy. The true difference between gas and charcoal lies in the flavor of the smoke, says Seamus Mullen, chef and owner of New York's Tertulia restaurant. He avoids using gas because its flavor is too neutral. "With charcoal, the sky is the limit to impart flavor," he says. "Charcoal creates a smoky aroma that goes a lot further to make the food shine." Mullen concedes that it's tricky: "It takes a lot more skill to grill effectively with natural fuel than it does with gas, but if you're good, you can control the temperature." That appears to hold people to a certain standard and make them easier to blame than the grill, which isn't really part of the pastime.
