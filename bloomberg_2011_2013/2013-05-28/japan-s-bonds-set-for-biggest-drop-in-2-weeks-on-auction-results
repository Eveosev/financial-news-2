Japan ’s government  bonds  fell,
heading for their biggest decline in two weeks, as the nation’s
stocks rallied and a sale of 20-year securities met the weakest
demand in nine months.  Benchmark 10-year yields were set for the highest close
since April 2012 after the government’s offer of 1.2 trillion
yen ($11.8 billion) in 20-year debt drew bids for 2.54 times the
amount on offer, down from a bid-to-cover ratio of 3.68 at the
previous sale. Bank of Japan Policy Board Member Ryuzo Miyao
said a better economic outlook could drive yields up.  “Selling dominated after the weak auction,” said  Akito Fukunaga , the chief rates strategist in  Tokyo  at Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc’s RBS Securities unit, one of the 24 primary
dealers that underwrite Japan’s debt. “The  bond market  has yet
to settle down amid concerns of a further sell-off.”  Japan’s 10-year yields increased 7 1/2 basis points to
0.905 percent as of 4:33 p.m. in Tokyo, according to Japan Bond
Trading Co. The price of the 0.6 percent note due in March 2023
fell 0.660 yen, or 660 yen per 100,000 yen face amount, to
97.253 yen. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Twenty-year yields climbed four basis points 1.7 percent,
while 30-year rates added one basis point to 1.835 percent.
Five-year yields gained five basis points to 0.4 percent.  Ten-year bond futures for June delivery slid 0.59 to 141.84
in Tokyo, while the Topix Index of shares rallied 1.2 percent.  Japanese  government bonds  have fallen 1.3 percent this
month as of yesterday, the biggest drop since April 2008,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
