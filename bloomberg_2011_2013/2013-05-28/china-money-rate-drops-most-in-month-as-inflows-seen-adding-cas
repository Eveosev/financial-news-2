China ’s benchmark money-market rate
fell the most in a month on speculation accelerated  yuan  gains
will attract more capital inflows, boosting cash supply.  The People’s Bank of China issued 7 billion yuan ($1.1
billion) of three-month bills at a  yield  of 2.9089 percent,
unchanged for a sixth sale, according to a trader required to
bid at the auctions. The Chinese currency, which has risen 1.6
percent in the past three months, touched a 19-year high of
6.1210 per dollar yesterday.  “There are probably huge capital inflows, which are
helping ease cash shortages,” said Wang Huane, a senior bond
trader at Qilu Bank Co. in Jinan, capital of the eastern
Shandong province.  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, declined 60 basis points, or 0.6
percentage point, to 3.49 percent as of 9:48 a.m. in  Shanghai ,
the biggest drop since April 26, according to a weighted average
rate compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.  The central bank also issued 12 billion yuan of 28-day
repurchase contracts today to drain funds from markets.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, was unchanged at
3.28 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
