U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
George Osborne said he reached agreement with seven government
departments to cut spending by as much as 10 percent for the
2015-2016 fiscal year.  The departments involved include justice, energy and
communities, Osborne said in television interviews today. The
steps get him 20 percent of the way toward his target of
reducing expenditures by 11.5 billion pounds ($17.4 billion) for
the period, which goes beyond the next general election.  “We’re setting out how these seven departments are going
to find savings,” Osborne told ITV. He said the money would pay
for infrastructure investment.  Osborne has pledged to protect the budgets of schools,
hospitals and international development, requiring deeper cuts
elsewhere. His Conservative Party’s coalition allies, the
Liberal Democrats, are opposed to further reductions in the
welfare budget.  Osborne told the  BBC  that he was not planning further tax
increases or welfare cuts. The other departments to have agreed
with Osborne are Northern Ireland, the Cabinet Office, the
Foreign Office and the Treasury itself.  The chancellor is scheduled to announce his 2015-16
spending plans in Parliament in  London  on June 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
