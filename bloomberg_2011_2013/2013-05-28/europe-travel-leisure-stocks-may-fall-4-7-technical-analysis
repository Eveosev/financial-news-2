A gauge of European travel and
leisure stocks may decline as much as 4.7 percent after failing
to clear a key resistance level last week, according to Natixis.  The Stoxx 600 Travel & Leisure Index didn’t break above
171.34, indicating it may fall to a level as low as 158.6, said
Ouri Mimran, a technical analyst at Natixis in Paris. That’s a
slide of 4.7 percent from yesterday’s close. The gauge dropped
1.9 percent last week, the first weekly loss since April 19.  “In the short term, I clearly expect an extension of the
consolidation we’re seeing,” said Mimran. “In the long term,
we are still in a bull market, so I’m cautious about the
downside target.”  The index will have to first fall below a support of 164.84
before declining further, he said. The 171.34 level represents
the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the slide from June
2007 through March 2009 as the financial crisis unfolded.  European travel and leisure stocks on May 20  surged  to
their highest level since December 2007, as an increase in full-year profit at Ryanair Holdings Plc boosted investors’ optimism
about the industry. The gauge rose 0.2 percent to 166.47
yesterday.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
