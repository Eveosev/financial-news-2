AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)  agreed to pay about
$323 million for  Omthera Pharmaceuticals Inc. (OMTH) , a U.S. developer
of treatments for abnormal levels of fats in the bloodstream, as
the U.K. company’s best-selling drug faces competition.  AstraZeneca will pay $12.70 a share for Omthera, or 88
percent more than the $6.77 closing price on May 24, it said
today in a statement. Omthera shares doubled in New York.  The London-based maker of the Crestor cholesterol-lowering
pill will gain Princeton, New Jersey-based  Omthera ’s
experimental treatment for patients with high levels of
triglycerides, which like cholesterol can contribute to heart
attack and stroke. Crestor, AstraZeneca’s best-selling medicine
with $6.25 billion in 2012 revenue, will face generic
competition in the U.S. starting in 2016. Crestor sales have
been declining since cheaper copies of  Pfizer Inc. (PFE) ’s Lipitor
cholesterol drug became available in 2011.  AstraZeneca plans to seek approval to sell Omthera’s
Epanova “as soon as possible” as a single therapy and in
combination with Crestor. Epanova is a capsule containing a
mixture of polyunsaturated-free fatty acids derived from fish
oils. The product would compete with  GlaxoSmithKline Plc’s (GSK) 
Lovaza and  Amarin Corp.’s (AMRN)  Vascepa, which also are used in
patients with high triglyceride levels.  In addition to the $12.70 cash payment, each Omthera
shareholder will receive about $4.70 in contingent value rights
if certain development goals are met. That would bring the total
value of the deal to about $443 million, including Omthera’s $63
million in cash balances, AstraZeneca said.  Omthera, which had its initial public offering on April 11,
doubled to $13.51 at the close in  New York . AstraZeneca shares
advanced 2.7 percent to close at 3,521.50 pence in London
trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
