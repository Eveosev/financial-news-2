Australia ’s dollar traded 0.6 percent
from the lowest level since 2011 before U.S. data forecast to
show improvements in  consumer confidence  and manufacturing amid
speculation the  Federal Reserve  may slow stimulus.  The Aussie’s one-month volatility versus the greenback was
near the highest since June. The currency rebounded against the
yen, snapping a four-day slide, as technical indicators signaled
recent losses were excessive. Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last
week the Fed may slow quantitative easing if there are signs of
sustained economic growth. Demand for the Australia and New
Zealand currencies was limited on prospects slowing Chinese
output will curb the South Pacific nations’ exports.  “It would be interesting to see whether the expectations
will continue for the Fed to wind down QE,” said Janu Chan, a
Sydney-based economist at St. George Bank Ltd. “There’s a bit
of uncertainty about  China . Chinese data this week could
increase the chance of the RBA cutting sooner rather than later.
I wouldn’t rule out Aussie falling further,” Chan said,
referring to the  Reserve Bank  of Australia.  The Australian dollar was little changed at 96.40 U.S.
cents as of 3:10 p.m. in Sydney from 96.34 yesterday. It reached
95.82 on June 1, the lowest since October 2011. The currency’s
one-month implied volatility was at 11.160 percent from 11.255
percent yesterday, when it reached 11.375, the highest since
June 26.  Aussie Rebounds  The Aussie jumped 1 percent to 98.23 yen, after dropping
3.2 percent over the previous four sessions. The currency traded
at NZ$1.1924 from NZ$1.1917 yesterday, when it touched
NZ$1.1886, the lowest since January 2009.  New Zealand ’s dollar was unchanged at 80.85 U.S. cents. The
kiwi strengthened 1 percent to 82.39 yen.  Australia’s  10-year bond  yield rose 5 basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 3.32 percent. New Zealand’s two-year swap
rate, a fixed payment made to receive a flowing rate, rose 4
basis points to 2.95 percent.  The Conference Board’s  index  of U.S. consumer sentiment
probably climbed to 71 this month from 68.1 in April, according
to the median estimate of economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News 
before the New York-based private research group releases the
data today.  Data last week from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
 showed  a preliminary reading for a purchasing manager’s index of
Chinese manufacturing fell to 49.6 in May, below the 50.4
estimated by economists in a Bloomberg survey. A reading below
50 indicates a contraction.  Trading Partner  China is the biggest trading partner for both Australia and
New Zealand. A PMI reading from the Chinese government is due
for release on June 1.  Interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg show traders
see a 26 percent chance the central bank will lower its
benchmark to 2.5 percent at the next meeting on June 4.  The Australian’s dollar’s 14-day relative strength index
versus the yen dropped to 30.7 yesterday, near the 30 level
which indicates an asset’s price has fallen too rapidly and may
be poised to reverse course.  To contact the reporter on this story:
