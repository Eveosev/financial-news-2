Volkswagen AG (VOW) ,  Europe ’s largest
carmaker, agreed to raise wages for German workers by 5.7
percent over 20 months as the country’s biggest manufacturing
union helped employees tap into the company’s growing profit.  VW will increase base pay by 3.4 percent as of Sept. 1 and
another 2.2 percent as of July 1, 2014, the Wolfsburg, Germany-based company said in a statement today.  Contract terms are in line with an industrywide pay
increase that the IG Metall union won in mid-May for about
770,000 manufacturing workers in the state of Bavaria. That
accord is being used as a model for labor agreements elsewhere
in the country. The VW pact, negotiated separately from  IG
Metall ’s regional accords, covers 102,000 employees at six
plants in western  Germany  and the financial services unit.  Germany’s economy grew just 0.1 percent in the first
quarter, according to the Federal Statistics Office. The economy
of the euro area, Germany’s biggest export destination, is
slated to shrink a second consecutive year in 2013. IG Metall
and employers have been taking regional industry strengths and
weaknesses into account in weighing a national pay accord.
Inflation will amount to less than 2 percent in 2013 and 2014,
according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  VW  rose  as much as 0.9 percent to 169.05 euros and was
trading up 0.7 percent at 11:08 a.m. in  Frankfurt . That pared
the stock’s decline this year to 2.1 percent.  The company’s  presence in  China  and  profit  from its
Porsche, Audi and Bentley luxury brands have helped VW avoid the
full effects of slumping demand for mass-market cars in Europe,
where industrywide sales are falling a sixth consecutive year.  Delivery Gains  The company delivered more than 3 million cars, vans and
trucks worldwide in the first four months of this year, the
first time its sales have exceeded that figure in the period.  The carmaker’s earnings before interest and taxes rose 2.1
percent last year to 11.5 billion euros ($14.9 billion).
Volkswagen is  forecasting  an increase in revenue in 2013, driven
by higher vehicle sales, while operating profit is predicted to
match last year’s figure because of the European car-market
decline and an increase in spending on new models and factories.  Volkswagen’s workforce in Germany totals 249,000 people. It
employs just fewer than 550,000 workers worldwide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
