Financial markets must be subject to
simple regulations that remove risk and tame them, said  Juergen Trittin , the co-leader of Germany’s opposition Greens party.  “Simple and applicable rules, with few possibilities for
abuse, which are understood by regulators, those regulated and
shareholders, are superior to tens of thousands of pages of
regulatory rules,” Trittin said at a conference in Frankfurt
today. “If financial markets become less complex, and maybe
more boring, as a consequence, that’s to be welcomed.”  The Greens, which want to form an alliance with the main
opposition Social Democratic Party after Sept. 22 elections and
prevent Chancellor  Angela Merkel  from winning a third term, are
campaigning on a platform of tax increases, a national minimum
wage and a greater emphasis on spurring growth in  Europe .  “The goal of regulation mustn’t be to match the complexity
of the financial world,” Trittin said. “The goal must be to
make financial markets so secure that they create more benefits
than harm.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
