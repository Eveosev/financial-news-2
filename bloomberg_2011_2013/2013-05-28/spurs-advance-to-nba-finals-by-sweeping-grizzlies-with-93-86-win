Tony Parker  scored 37 points, his
highest tally of the postseason, as the San Antonio Spurs won
93-86 to sweep the  Memphis Grizzlies  and advance to the National
Basketball Association Finals.  It’s the first time the Spurs have reached the championship
round since they won a fourth NBA title in 2007.  “They had a great run and I’m happy we’re done with
them,” Parker said of the Grizzlies in a televised interview
with ESPN. “They’re very physical.”  The Spurs will face the winner of the Eastern Conference
finals. The defending NBA-champion Miami Heat lead the  Indiana
Pacers  by two games to one in the best-of-seven series that
resumes tonight in Indianapolis.  The Spurs led 24-14 at the end of the first quarter of Game
4 at FedExForum in Memphis last night and 44-38 at halftime. The
Grizzlies matched San Antonio’s 28-point tally in the third
period and were within three points of the Spurs with 48 seconds
remaining in the game when  Marc Gasol ’s jump shot made it 89-86.  Parker then completed the scoring with four points from the
free-throw line to take his second-half total to 25 points.  Tim Duncan  had 15 points and eight rebounds for San
Antonio, while Kawhi Leonard contributed 11 points. Quincy Pondexter led the Grizzlies with 22 points and Gasol ended the
game with 14 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
