U.K. government ministers should
present “unspun” official statistics rather than picking out
numbers to support their cause, a panel of lawmakers said.  In the past six months, Andrew Dilnot, the chairman of the
U.K. statistics authority, has reprimanded Prime Minister David Cameron, Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith and
Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt for making misleading statistical
assertions.  In a report published today, Parliament’s  Public
Administration Committee  urged government statistics staff to
work more closely with press officers to avoid further
incidents.  “In our evidence, we were given examples of where the
change in one month’s figures, on say trade or unemployment,
would generate the headline, but where the trend over the year,
a far more significant indicator, is ignored,” Committee
chairman Bernard Jenkin, a member of Cameron’s Conservative
Party, said in an e-mailed statement. “We are expecting
statistics officials to insist that press releases tell the true
picture.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
