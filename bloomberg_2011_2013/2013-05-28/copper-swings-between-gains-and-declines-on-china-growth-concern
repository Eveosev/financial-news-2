Copper swung between gains and
declines in London as investors weighed concern about the
outlook for Chinese economic growth against signs of continued
strength in the U.S. housing market.  China needs annual expansion of about 7 percent to double
per-capita gross domestic product by 2020 from the level in
2010, Premier  Li Keqiang  said yesterday. That compares with more
than 10 percent in the prior 10 years. Figures today will show
the S&P/Case-Shiller index of house prices in 20 U.S. cities
rose for a 14th month in March, economists said.  “Base-metal prices are beginning the new week of trading
largely unchanged,”  Daniel Briesemann , an analyst at
Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, said by e-mail.  Copper for delivery in three months slipped 0.1 percent to
$7,295 a metric ton by 10:16 a.m. on the London Metal Exchange.
Prices dropped as much as 1.1 percent and added as much as 0.6
percent. Copper for delivery in July rose 0.3 percent to $3.304
a pound on the Comex in  New York . The LME and Comex floor
trading were shut for national holidays yesterday.  The S&P/Case-Shiller gauge increased 1 percent in March,
according to economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  China’s economy  expanded 7.7 percent in the first quarter,
below economists’ forecasts and down from 7.9 percent in the
previous three months. The government has a full-year target of
7.5 percent.  Copper  stockpiles  monitored by the LME fell for a third
session to 619,650 tons, daily exchange figures showed. They’re
still up 94 percent this year. Orders to remove the metal from
warehouses climbed 0.5 percent to 223,150 tons on bookings in
the Belgian city of Antwerp, the first gain after three sessions
of declines from the record high reached May 21.  Lead touched the highest price since April 11 in  London .
Aluminum, tin and zinc rose as nickel slipped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
