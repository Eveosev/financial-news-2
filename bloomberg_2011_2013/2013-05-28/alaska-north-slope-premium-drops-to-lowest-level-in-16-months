Alaska North Slope oil’s premium to
West Texas Intermediate fell to a 16-month low as refiners sent
more Bakken crude to the West Coast from  North Dakota  by rail.  The Alaskan grade weakened 95 cents against WTI to a
premium of $8.90 a barrel at 1:52 p.m. in New York, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg, the lowest level since Jan. 4, 2012.
ANS has weakened against WTI and Bakken this year as refiners
including  Phillips 66 (PSX)  announced they would move more oil to
their West Coast refineries from North Dakota.  “The rail movement from the midcontinent west is competing
with ANS,” said  Andrew Lebow , a senior vice president at
Jefferies Bache LLC in New York. “With the additional rail
capacity, it makes sense that WTI-ANS has tightened.”  Bakken was unchanged at a  $5 discount  to WTI. On Feb. 25,
ANS traded at a premium to WTI of $18.75 and Bakken was at a
discount of $2.50.  Gulf Coast oils strengthened against WTI. Heavy Louisiana
Sweet gained $1 a barrel to $8.30 over WTI, and Light Louisiana
Sweet strengthened 45 cents to an $8.85 premium.  Thunder Horse  strengthened 90 cents to a premium of $6.50 a
barrel. Poseidon’s premium gained 60 cents to $3.70. Mars Blend
strengthened 70 cents to a $3.90 premium.  Southern Green Canyon lost 5 cents a barrel to trade at a
$2 premium to WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
