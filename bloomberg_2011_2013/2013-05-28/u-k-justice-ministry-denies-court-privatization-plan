The U.K. Ministry of Justice said it
won’t engage in the “wholesale privatization” of courts in
England and Wales after The  Times newspaper  reported that
Justice Secretary Chris Grayling favors the move.  Under plans being considered by ministers, court buildings
and staff could be taken out of state control and run by private
companies, the newspaper reported today. Funding would come from
bigger fees from wealthy litigants and from the private sector,
with  hedge funds  encouraged to invest, it said.  Grayling, who backs the measures, is expected to consider
the plans within two weeks for action late this year, The Times
said. To counter fears the independence of the courts might be
eroded, they would be protected by a Royal Charter that would
set out their rights and freedoms.  “We have always said we are determined to deliver a courts
system that is more effective and efficient, and provides
improved services for victims and witnesses,” the Justice
Ministry in London said in an e-mailed statement today. “The
proposals being considered are not the wholesale privatization
of the courts service.”  Grayling is seeking savings in his department’s budget as
Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  tries to find 11.5
billion pounds ($17 billion) of further cuts in central
 government spending .  For Related News and Information  To contact the reporter on this story:
