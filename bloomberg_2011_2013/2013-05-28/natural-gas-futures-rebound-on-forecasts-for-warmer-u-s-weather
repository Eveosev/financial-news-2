Natural gas futures rebounded in  New
York  amid forecasts of warmer weather in the U.S. that may boost
demand for electricity to power air conditioners.  The contract for June delivery rose as much as 1.7 percent
in electronic trading to $4.308 per million British thermal
units on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , and was at $4.261 at
12:20 p.m. Singapore time. The more actively traded July future
was up 0.6 percent at $4.31. Floor trading was closed yesterday
for the U.S. Memorial Day holiday.  Mild weather in the eastern U.S. will give way to above-normal temperature readings from today through June 1, according
to MDA Weather Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland . The heat may
then sweep across most of the lower 48 states through June 6.  Power generation accounts for 33 percent of U.S. gas
consumption, according to the Energy Information Administration,
the Energy Departmentâ€™s statistical arm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
