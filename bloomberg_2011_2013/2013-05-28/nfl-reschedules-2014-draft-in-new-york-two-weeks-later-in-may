The  National Football League  moved
the 2014 draft back two weeks into May because of a scheduling
conflict at  New York ’s Radio City Music Hall.  Next year’s draft, in which NFL teams select players who
have completed their college eligibility or renounced their
remaining eligibility, will be held May 8-10, the league said in
a statement. This year’s draft was held April 25-27.  NFL.com reported this month that the NFL would try a later
date for the three-day draft on a one-year trial before deciding
whether to make it permanent.  The NFL said in its statement that no decision has been
made regarding the draft dates in 2015 and beyond. The league
said teams have been told the NFL is looking at alternatives
that include holding the draft at Radio City  Music Hall ,
different venues in the New York area or in other cities.  The NFL said there was no significant change to the dates
of other offseason events such as the national scouting combine,
which will be held Feb. 18-25 in Indianapolis, or the start of
the new league year and free-agency period, which will be March
11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
