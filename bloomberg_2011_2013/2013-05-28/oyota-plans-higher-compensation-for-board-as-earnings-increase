Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s
biggest carmaker, plans to increase compensation and bonuses for
board members as it forecasts profit and sales will climb to the
highest level in six years.  Toyota plans to pay 1.1 billion yen ($10.8 million) in
compensation and 428 million yen in bonuses to  directors , as
well as audit and supervisory board members, for the year ended
March 2013, the company said in a  notice  sent to shareholders.
The total is 28 percent higher than a year  earlier .  The Japanese carmaker, which retook its global sales crown
from  General Motors Co. (GM)  and Volkswagen AG last year,  projects 
net income to increase 42 percent to 1.37 trillion yen in the
year ending March 2014. The Toyota City, Japan-based company
earlier this month reported its biggest annual profit in five
years, and in March approved the biggest bonus for workers since
2008.  The amount to be paid to directors will be decided at
Toyota’s June 14 shareholders’ meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
