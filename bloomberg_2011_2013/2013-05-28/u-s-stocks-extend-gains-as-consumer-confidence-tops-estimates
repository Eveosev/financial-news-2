U.S. stocks extended gains after a
report showed confidence among consumers climbed in May to the
highest level in more than five years as views on the economy
and labor market improved.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rallied 1.4 percent to
1,671.96 at 10:01 a.m. in  New York .  The Conference Board’s index rose to 76.2, the strongest
since February 2008 and exceeding the highest estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of economists, from a revised 69 in April, data
from the New York-based private research group showed today. The
median forecast called for an increase to 71.2.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
