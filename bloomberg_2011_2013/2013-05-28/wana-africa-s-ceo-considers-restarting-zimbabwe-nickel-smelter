Mwana Africa Plc (MWA) , a producer of
nickel, gold and diamonds, is considering restarting its nickel
smelter in northeastern  Zimbabwe  after a drop in prices eroded
profit margins on supplying the metal as concentrate.  “Nickel at this level is putting a lot of stress on the
system, particularly when exporting concentrate,” Chief
Executive Officer Kalaa Mpinga said in an interview at the
African Development Bank annual meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco
today. “It will increase pressure on us to restart our smelter
and refinery as soon as possible.”  Mwana’s Bindura site is the only integrated nickel mine,
smelter and refinery operation in Africa, according to the
London-based company’s website. The price of nickel for delivery
in three months has dropped 13 percent to $14,840 a metric ton
since the start of 2013 in London Metal Exchange trading.  “In the next three to four months, we will be able to make
a decision,” said Mpinga. “It is one of our foremost
priorities.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
