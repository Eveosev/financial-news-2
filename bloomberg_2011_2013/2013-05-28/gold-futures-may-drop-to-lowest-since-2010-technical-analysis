Gold futures may decline to a three-year low if the price breaches the April 16 low by the end of
June, extending a  bear market  that started last month, according
to technical analysis by research company JSC Corp.  The most-active contract on the Comex in  New York  fell
below the so-called cloud on Ichimoku charts and traded below
the 50-day moving average since February, said Takaki Shigemoto,
an analyst at the Tokyo-based company. If futures retreat below
$1,321.50 an ounce in coming weeks, they will then drop to
$1,155.80, reached in April 2010, he said.  Gold has dropped 17 percent this year in New York after
climbing in the previous 12 years. Futures plunged into a bear
market as some investors lost faith in the metal as a store of
value amid economic optimism, low inflation and a rally in
equities. The drop will be intensified if the  Federal Reserve 
begins scaling back monetary stimulus later this year, he said.
Bullion for August delivery rose 0.2 percent to $1,389.90 at
4:19 p.m. in  Tokyo .  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. The Ichimoku chart analyzes
midpoints of historic highs and lows, or so-called resistance
and support levels, with a breakout from above or below the
cloud pointing to a trend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
