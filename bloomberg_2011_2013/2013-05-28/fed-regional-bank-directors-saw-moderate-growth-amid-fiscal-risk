Directors at the  Federal Reserve ’s
district banks said last month U.S. housing was helping to
generate moderate economic growth amid risks from fiscal
cutbacks and high unemployment.  “Directors viewed economic activity as continuing to
expand at a moderate pace,” according to minutes released today
in  Washington  summarizing the discussions. “Overall, directors
continued to see downside risks to the outlook from the elevated
 unemployment rate  and ongoing fiscal constraints.”  Data released today underscore that the economy is gaining
strength. Assembly lines in the U.S. churned out more
automobiles and computers last month, pointing to a rebound in
manufacturing. Output at factories, mines and utilities climbed
0.3 percent, the biggest advance since February, after being
little changed in May, according to Fed data. Another report
showed homebuilders this month were the most confident in seven
years.  The minutes summarize discussions among board members at
the 12 regional reserve banks as they consider whether the Fed
should alter the discount rate that it charges on emergency
lending. The discussions were considered by the Fed’s
Washington-based Board of Governors at meetings on May 13, June
3 and June 17. The board made no change to the  discount rate ,
which has been at 0.75 percent since February 2010.  Directors at the district banks in  Kansas City  and
Philadelphia last month requested a quarter percentage-point
increase in the discount rate to 1 percent, while directors at
the other 10 banks voted to keep the rate unchanged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
