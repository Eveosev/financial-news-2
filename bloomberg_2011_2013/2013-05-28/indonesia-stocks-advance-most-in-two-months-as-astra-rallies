Indonesia ’s stocks rose the most two
months, led by auto-related companies including  PT Astra
International (ASII) , on speculation the government will introduce
measures to encourage purchases of alternative-energy vehicles.  The  Jakarta Composite (JCI)  Index climbed 1.8 percent to 5,178.06
at 2 p.m., heading for the biggest gain since March 27. Astra, a
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  distributor in Indonesia and the biggest
company in the Jakarta Composite, gained 6.4 percent, the most
since September 2010. The stock provided the biggest boost to
the benchmark measure. A sub-index of consumer goods stock which
includes auto companies gained 2.3 percent, the most among 10
industry groups.  President Yudhoyono has signed regulations that would
reduce the value-added tax on goods including low-cost “green”
cars provided they are assembled in Indonesia and meet minimum
local-content standards, Kompas reported on its website, citing
Johnny Darmawan, president director of Toyota-Astra Motor. Calls
to Darmawan’s mobile phone weren’t answered. He didn’t reply to
a text message.  “This provides a positive catalyst for Astra shares,”
Wilianto Ie, head of research at PT Nomura Indonesia, said by
phone today. He has a buy recommendation for the Astra with a
share-price estimate of 9,500 rupiah.  Other auto-related stocks also gained. Tire-maker  PT Gajah
Tunggal (GJTL)  jumped 6.4 percent and PT Multistrada Arah Sarana rose
1.3 percent.  Astra Otoparts Tbk PT (AUTO) , the parts-maker unit of
Astra International, gained 4.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
