Colombia’s peso weakened beyond 1,900
per U.S. dollar for the first time since January 2012 on rising
speculation the Federal Reserve will scale back stimulus that
has spurred dollar inflows into  emerging markets .  The peso plunged 0.6 percent to 1,898.42 per U.S. dollar at
the close of trading in Bogota. Earlier it plunged to 1,902.97,
the weakest level since Jan. 4, 2012. The currency has declined
for eight straight days.  The Colombian government and central bank this year have
increased dollar purchases to stem a rally that sent the
currency to a 17-month intraday high on Jan. 2. The currency is
down 6.9 percent in 2013. Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas
said today the exchange rate is sustainable and will remain at
the current rate “for some time.”  “Positive data in the U.S. is adding to the sense that the
Fed will reduce stimulus,” said Jorge Cardozo, an analyst at
Corredores Asociados brokerage in Bogota. “It’s having a huge
impact in all markets including the Colombian peso.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
