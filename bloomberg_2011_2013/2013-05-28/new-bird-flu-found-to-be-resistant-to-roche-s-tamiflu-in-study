A gene mutation known to make flu
viruses resistant to  Roche Holding AG (ROG) ’s Tamiflu was identified
in two patients infected with the H7N9 bird flu virus in  China ,
a study found.  The gene was discovered in two of three patients who became
the most severely ill in a  study  of 14 patients treated with
Tamiflu after being admitted to a Shanghai hospital in April
with H7N9 infection, according to an article published in The
Lancet medical journal today. In one patient, the resistance
developed after the initial infection, suggesting treatment with
Tamiflu may have spurred the mutation.  The finding is the first official confirmation of
resistance to Tamiflu. In the other patients, treatment with the
drug was associated with clearing the virus, and early treatment
of suspected or confirmed cases is “strongly encouraged,”
wrote a group of researchers led by Zhenghong  Yuan  of Fudan
University.  “The apparent ease with which antiviral resistance emerges
in A/H7N9 viruses is concerning,” the researchers wrote. “It
needs to be closely monitored and considered in future pandemic
response plans.”  Tamiflu belongs to a class of drugs called neuraminidase
inhibitors that also includes  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) ’s Relenza.  “Rates of Tamiflu resistance remain low globally, although
Roche takes the issue of resistance very seriously and
collaborates with international organizations and authorities to
monitor the situation,” Silvia Dobry, a spokeswoman for the
Basel, Switzerland-based drugmaker, said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
