OAO Magnit,  Russia ’s biggest food
retailer, jumped in Moscow and  London  trading after  MSCI Inc. (MSCI) 
increased its weighting in a benchmark gauge, fueling bets of
fund inflows.  Magnit rose as much as 5.1 percent, climbing 2.9 percent to
7,338.90 rubles by 12:03 p.m. in Moscow. The number of shares
traded was equivalent to about 86 percent of the stock’s three-month average. Global depositary receipts added 2.2 percent to
$56.80 in London, increasing for the first time in three days.  MSCI lifted Magnit’s GDRs to 9 percent from 4.7 percent in
its Russia 10/40 Index, replacing  OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) ’
American depositary receipts and AFK  Sistema (SSA) ’s GDRs in the
gauge’s top four, according to e-mailed notes from Sberbank CIB
and VTB Capital. The changes, effective June 3, will give Magnit
the same weight as OAO Lukoil and OAO Gazprom. VTB Capital
estimates potential fund inflows into Magnit GDRs to be $331
million, according to its note today.  “The news has a positive effect on the overall attitude
toward the stock because it reflects Magnit’s strong business
development and its capitalization growth, as well as its high
free float in money terms,” Natalia Kolupaeva, an analyst at
ZAO Raiffeisenbank, said by phone from Moscow.  Magnit has rallied 53 percent in Moscow this year, while
its GDRs have risen 42 percent in the same period. Magnit, the
retailer owned by Russian billionaire Sergey Galitskiy, overtook
sales at its rival  X5 Retail Group NV (FIVE)  for the first time since
its founding last month. Since a London IPO in 2008, Magnit has
tripled its store network to more than 7,000. In 2011, Magnit
exceeded the market value of X5, which had expanded by acquiring
rivals including Karousel and Kopeyka.  MSCI reduced MTS’s ADRs and Sistema’s GDRs combined
weighting in the 10/40 index to 4.5 percent, according to
today’s note from Sberbank CIB. MTS rose 0.3 percent to 262.30
rubles in Moscow, while the benchmark Micex stock rose 1.4
percent. Sistema’s GDRs increased 0.7 percent to $20.03 in
London, and its shares added 0.6 percent to 27.059 rubles in
Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
