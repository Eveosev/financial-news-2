highest level since 2008 and home values jumped the most in
seven years, boosting the outlook for exporters.  American Depositary Receipts of Toyota Motor Corp., the

governor Haruhiko Kuroda addresses a conference this morning.
Futures on  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index were little changed and

valuations,” said Johannes Jooste, who helps oversee more than
$1.76 trillion as a market strategist at Merrill Lynch Wealth

signaled no extension to his monetary stimulus package, loose
Japanese monetary policy should remain a bolster for local
liquidity.”  Japan’s Topix index, the broadest equity gauge, added 1.2
percent to close yesterday at 1,168.27 after falling as much as
1.2 percent. Even after a 9.6 percent drop in the previous three

level in more than five years, a Conference Board report showed
yesterday. The index rose to 76.2, the strongest since February

months through March by the most in seven years as the recovery
