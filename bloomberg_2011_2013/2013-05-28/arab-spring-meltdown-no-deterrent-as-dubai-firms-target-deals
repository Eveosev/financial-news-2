Abraaj Group, the Dubai-based private equity firm with $7.5 billion in assets, is among Gulf investors targeting acquisitions in North Africa as a surging population boosts demand for products from health care to food and banking.  Abraaj plans to raise as much as $250 million for a second North Africa fund after fully investing its first, Ahmed Badreldin, the firm’s head of the  Middle East  and North Africa, said in an interview. Majid Al Futtaim Holding LLC, a Dubai-based owner and operator of malls and hypermarkets, is buying the Metro supermarket chain in  Egypt  and is also building a mall outside Cairo, Chief Executive Officer Iyad Malas said.  Investors from the oil-rich Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, are seeking to deploy cash into industries benefiting from  consumer spending  in North Africa even as political turmoil trap the Egyptian economy in its worst slowdown for two decades.  “There is this myth that Arab Spring economies have no growth, no opportunities,” Badreldin said at the  World Economic Forum  in  Jordan  May 24. “That’s not really the case.” The firm’s existing businesses in North Africa are increasing revenue by about 20 percent a year, he said.  Abraaj has stakes in more than 30 companies in the Middle East and North Africa, including medical laboratories in Egypt, an aircraft maintenance facility in Jordan, supermarket chain Spinneys and Cairo-based technology company OMS. It usually invests a maximum of $100 million in a company, he said.  Private Consumption  Private consumption in Egypt, whose population of about 82 million is about double the size of the six-nation GCC combined, made up almost 90 percent of gross domestic product in the fiscal year that ended June 2012, government data show.  Populations in North Africa in particular “are large, young and fast growing, creating a strong backdrop for consumer demand, even when overall growth is sub-trend,” said  Simon Williams , chief Middle East and North Africa economist at HSBC Holdings Plc in Dubai. “The Gulf is running large surpluses that it is keen to deploy in markets that it knows well.”  Gulf companies are also taking advantage of a retreat by European competitors in the region.  Qatar Telecom  QSC and Emirates Telecommunications Corp. are bidding for  Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s stake in Maroc Telecom SA, while Qatar National Bank bought Paris-based Societe Generale SA’s majority stake in its Egyptian unit. Qatar Telecom has secured about $12 billion in financing for the Maroc Telecom bid, Chief Executive Officer Nasser Marafih said in an interview on May 26.  Reserves Slide  Investments in North Africa are aiding countries struggling to create jobs and boost economic growth amid domestic unrest and weak demand for their products in  Europe .  Egypt is struggling to secure a $4.8 billion IMF loan to stem the worst slide in foreign reserves in at least 15 years. The Washington-based lender reached an initial agreement on a $1.8 billion loan to  Tunisia  and extended a $6.2 billion  credit line  to  Morocco  last year.  ‘Economic Potential’  Still, the turmoil prompted Abraaj to delay the initial public offering of its medical diagnostics business in Egypt. The benchmark  EGX 30 stock index  dropped 1 percent this year, compared with a 43 percent jump in Dubai’s  DFM General Index. (DFMGI)   Majid Al Futtaim, which has agreed to acquire Carrefour SA’s 25 percent stake in its Middle East joint venture, expects to complete talks to buy the Metro supermarkets from the Mansour Group in a “few weeks” Malas also said in Jordan.  The company is also expanding in Lebanon, a country struggling with the spillover from the civil war in neighboring Syria. In addition to opening a shopping mall in  Beirut  in April, Majid Al Futtaim is developing a residential project on the coastline, Malas said.  “You have to take some sort of medium to long term view when you’re making a decision on these investments,” he said. “You’ve got to consider the fundamentals of the country, the consumer, its economic potential.”  To contact the reporters on this story: Alaa Shahine in Dubai at  asalha@bloomberg.net ; Stefania Bianchi in Dubai at  sbianchi10@bloomberg.net   To contact the editors responsible for this story: Andrew J.
