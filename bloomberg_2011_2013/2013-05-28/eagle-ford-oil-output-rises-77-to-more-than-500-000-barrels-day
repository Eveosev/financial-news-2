Oil production in  Texas ’s Eagle Ford
shale formation rose more Than 77 percent in March from a year
earlier, topping 500,000 barrels a day and posting a record.  The nine geographic fields that make up the majority of
Eagle Ford yielded 529,874 barrels of crude a day, according to
preliminary data released by the  Texas Railroad Commission ,
which oversees oil and gas drilling in the state. The fields
produced 298,266 barrels daily in March 2012.  February output was revised to 511,434 barrels a day from
the preliminary report of 471,258, the commission said.
Production totals typically increase in subsequent months as the
state receives revised, corrected or late reports.  Growing production out of Eagle Ford is helping fuel a
renaissance in Texas crude. The  state  produced 2.3 million
barrels a day in February, the highest monthly level since April
1986, according to the Energy Information Administration, the
statistical arm of the Energy Department. The EIA hasn’t
released March production data for the state.  EOG Resources Inc. (EOG)  is the largest leaseholder in the Eagle
Ford play, with 639,000 net acres.  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  is
next with 485,000, followed by Apache Corp. and BP Plc,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Plains Marketing LP’s  posted price  for Eagle Ford light oil
today was $90.75 a barrel, compared with the most recent
settlement prices of $94.15 for West Texas Intermediate and
$102.62 for Brent.  Output of condensates, or natural gas liquids, was 89,345
barrels a day in March, down from 123,871 a year earlier, as
drillers moved away from less profitable gas. Production of
natural gas was 1.89 billion cubic feet a day, compared with
2.03 billion the year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
