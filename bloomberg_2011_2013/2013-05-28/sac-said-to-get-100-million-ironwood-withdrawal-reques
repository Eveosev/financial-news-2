Ironwood Capital Management Corp., a
firm that invests in  hedge funds , plans to pull the $100 million
it has in  Steven Cohen ’s SAC Capital Advisors LP, according to a
person with knowledge of the matter.  The decision was made after  Stamford , Connecticut-based SAC
said May 17 it would no longer unconditionally cooperate with
the U.S. government in its multiyear insider-trading
investigation, said the person, who asked not to be named
because the information is private.  Investors in Cohen’s $15 billion hedge-fund firm have until
June 3 to put in their redemption requests for the second
quarter. Clients asked to redeem $1.68 billion in the first
quarter, a person familiar with the firm said at the time.  Jonathan Gans, chief executive officer of San Francisco-based Ironwood, declined to comment on its redemption plans,
which were reported earlier today by the Wall Street Journal.
Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for SAC at Sard Verbinnen &
Co., declined to comment.  SAC in March reached a record $602 million settlement with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over claims the firm
and one of its units profited from illegal tips about a drug
trial received by a former portfolio manager. Both the SEC and
the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan continue to investigate
SAC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
