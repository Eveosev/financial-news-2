EFG-Hermes Holding SAE (EFGD) , Egypt’s
largest investment bank, said it’s been hired by Dubai-based
private equity firm Abraaj Group to advise on the sale of its
controlling stake in the Spinneys supermarket chain.  The bank, based in Cairo, confirmed its appointment in an
e-mailed response to questions by  Bloomberg News , without giving
further details. A spokeswoman for Abraaj, who asked not to be
identified because of company policy, declined to comment.  Spinneys was founded in Alexandria, Egypt, in 1924 and
acquired by Abraaj in 2004. Ahmed Badreldin, a partner at the
firm and head of the  Middle East  and North Africa, said in a May
24 interview that the firm is considering a sale of the Spinneys
stake. Abraaj has about $7.5 billion of assets.  Majid Al Futtaim Holding LLC, a Dubai-based mall and
supermarket operator, is in the “early stages” of looking at
the stake in Spinneys after acquiring  Carrefour SA (CA) ’s 25 percent
stake in its Middle East joint venture, Chief Executive Officer
Iyad Malas said in an interview on May 25. A deal with Spinneys
would be valued at less than $500 million, Malas said.  Spinneys has outlets in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Qatar
and operates in the United Arab Emirates under franchise.  To contact the reporters on this story:
