Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  sold $4 billion of bonds
in its first dollar-denominated offering in more than four
years.  The world’s largest drugmaker issued $1 billion of 1.5
percent, five-year securities to yield 50 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries and an equal portion of 3 percent,
10-year debt with a relative yield of 87.5 basis points,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Pfizer also sold $750 million of 0.9 percent notes due
January 2017 paying a spread of 45 and an equal amount of 4.3
percent, 30-year debt that pays 100, Bloomberg data show. A $500
million portion of five-year, floating-rate debt yields 30 basis
points more than the three-month London interbank offered rate.  The issue will be used to repay the company’s 1.85 billion
euros of 3.625 percent bonds due June 3, according to a
regulatory filing. Proceeds may also be used to repay a portion
of Pfizer’s $750 million of 4.5 percent debentures and $1.75
billion of 5.5 percent securities, both maturing in February
2014, the company said in the filing. Other funds may be used
for investments or to pay down part of its $1.75 billion of
commercial paper.  Pfizer last sold dollar-denominated debt in March 2009,
when the  New-York  based pharmaceutical manufacturer issued $13.5
billion of securities in five parts. That offering included
$3.25 billion of 6.2 percent, 10-year notes that were priced to
yield 325 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries.
Those bonds traded at 124.9 cents on the dollar on May 22 to
yield 1.67 percent, or 78.5 basis points more than benchmarks,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The new notes are rated A1 by Moody’s Investors Service,
the credit grader said in a statement today. Citigroup Inc.,
Credit Suisse Group AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc managed the offering, according to a
regulatory filing by Pfizer.  Libor, the rate at which banks say they can borrow in
dollars from each other, was set at 0.273 percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
