Coal India Ltd. (COAL) , the world’s biggest
miner of the fuel, was poised for the biggest gain in more than
16 months after increasing prices for the first time in more
than two years.  The  shares  jumped 3.6 percent to 325 rupees as of 10:19 a.m.
in Mumbai, headed for their steepest jump since Jan. 13, 2012.
The price increase, effective today, will add about 21.2 billion
rupees ($380 million) in revenue for the year started April 1
and 25.1 billion rupees annually from the next fiscal year, the
company said in a stock exchange filing yesterday, without
giving details.  Higher prices will help Coal  India  counter an increase in
wage and input costs and may allow the government to seek a
higher valuation for the shares when it sells a 10 percent stake
in the Kolkata-based company.  “The price increase will help the government draw
investors for the share sale,” said Deven Choksey, managing
director at Mumbai-based KR Choksey Shares & Securities Pvt.  The federal government, which owns 90 percent in the
company, aims to raise 200 billion rupees selling a 10 percent
stake in the company, according to a finance ministry draft
proposal dated obtained by  Bloomberg News  last month.  Coal India reported a better-than-expected 35 percent jump
in profit for the three months ended March 31, aided by higher
shipments and a reduction in wage provisions that led to a
decrease in employee costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
