China is considering improvements to
its system for tracking property owned by officials, the  China
Daily  reported, citing Tian Guoliang, a professor at the Party
School of the  Central Committee  of the Chinese Communist Party.  One “prominent” problem with the current regulations,
introduced in 1995, is that the information declared by
officials is difficult to verify, the newspaper cited Tian as
saying. China may build a database of property owned by
government officials and their relatives that would
automatically collect information from financial institutions
and alert anti-graft authorities to any changes, China Daily
cited Tian as saying.  An analysis of 103 corruption cases conducted by Tian found
most of the officials began taking bribes in the 1990s without
being exposed until after 2005, according to the report. This
shows many officials have been able to escape the supervision of
the current system, Tian was cited as saying.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
