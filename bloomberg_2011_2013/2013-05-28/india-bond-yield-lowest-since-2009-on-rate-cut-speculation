Indian bonds fell on speculation
yields at the lowest level in more than three years will deter
buyers.  The yield on the 8.15 percent bond due June 2022 earlier
touched 7.31 percent, the least since November 2009, on
speculation slowing inflation and weak growth will prompt the
central bank to add to three rate cuts this year. The rate rose
two basis points to 7.36 percent today. The gross domestic
product  increased  4.8 percent in the three months through March,
according to the median of 33 estimates in a Bloomberg survey
before data due May 31. That compares with 4.5 percent growth in
the previous quarter, the slowest pace since 2009.  “Bonds have dropped probably because investors found the
levels attractive for booking profits,” said Srinivasa Raghavan, the Mumbai-based executive vice president of treasury
at Dhanalaxmi Bank Ltd. “However, yields will continue to have
a downward bias given the favorable macro-economic setting.”  Wholesale  prices  rose 4.89 percent in April, the least in
41 months, official data show. The  Reserve Bank  of  India , which
has cut the repurchase  rate  75 basis points this year to 7.25
percent, will next review monetary policy on June 17.  “Inflation is becoming less of a problem and the central
bank is set to continue easing what has been a tight monetary
policy,” National Australia Bank economists including Tom
Taylor wrote in a research note today. “We still expect to see
more rate cuts by the end of the year with a repo rate of 6.5
percent or 6.75 percent by the year-end a likely outcome.”  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose four basis
points to 7.13 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
