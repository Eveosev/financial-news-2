A tornado that leveled an  Oklahoma 
City suburb last week probably cost insurers $2 billion to $3.5
billion in claims, according to catastrophe modeler Risk
Management Solutions Inc.  The estimate includes damage to personal, commercial and
industrial property as well as potential claims for business
interruption, Matthew Nielsen, director of model product
management at RMS, said today in a phone interview. Costs from
automobile policies were excluded.  The storm that swept through Moore, Oklahoma, on May 20
packed winds of more than 200 miles (322 kilometers) an hour and
killed at least 24 people. Insurers including Allstate Corp. and
State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. have dispatched staff
to the area to help customers file claims. The storm may have
caused more damage than the $2.8 billion in losses from the 2011
tornado in Joplin,  Missouri , Nielsen said.  “This certainly has a chance of topping that, given the
loss range that we’ve provided,” he said. “It’s definitely up
there and could even potentially be the largest single tornado
loss that we’ve seen.”  Tornadoes that struck in the U.S. from May 18 to May 20
will probably cost insurers $2 billion to $5 billion, led by the
Oklahoma storm, modeling firm Eqecat said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
