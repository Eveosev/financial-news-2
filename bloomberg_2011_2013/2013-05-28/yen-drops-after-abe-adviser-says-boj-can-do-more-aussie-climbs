The dollar gained versus the euro and
the yen as reports showed U.S.  consumer confidence  reached the
highest level since 2008 and home values climbed, bolstering
bets the  Federal Reserve  will slow its bond buying.  Japan ’s currency slid against most of its major peers after
an adviser to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the
nation’s central bank can add to its unprecedented stimulus if
necessary to support economic revival.  South Africa ’s rand
tumbled to a four-year low after the economy slowed more than
forecast in the first quarter. An inflation indicator favored by
the Fed declined in April, a report on May 31 may show.  “Confidence today was quite good, which could help the
economic outlook,” Brian Kim, a foreign-exchange strategist at
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc’s RBS Securities unit in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut , said in a telephone interview. “But
ultimately the Fed outlook still hinges on what we see in terms
of inflation.”  The dollar appreciated 0.6 percent to $1.2856 per euro at 5
p.m. New York time. The greenback strengthened 1.4 percent to
102.37 yen after reaching 103.74 on May 22, the strongest level
since October 2008. The Japanese currency slid 0.8 percent to
131.59 per euro.  Trading in over-the-counter foreign-exchange options
totaled $31 billion, compared with $27 billion on May 24,
according to data reported by U.S. banks to the Depository Trust
Clearing Corp. and tracked by Bloomberg. Volume in options on
the dollar-yen  exchange rate  amounted to $8.4 billion, the
largest share of trades at 27 percent. Euro-dollar options were
the second most-actively traded, at $3.7 billion, or 12 percent.  Above Average  Dollar-yen options trading was 9 percent above the average
for the past five Tuesdays at a similar time in the day,
according to Bloomberg analysis. Euro-dollar options trading was
5 percent below average.  The  Hungarian forint  gained versus most of 31 major
counterparts after the country’s central bank kept an interest-rate reduction to no more than a quarter-percentage point for a
10th consecutive month as the inflation rate plunged. The
currency appreciated 0.1 percent to 223.55 per dollar after
rising 1.3 percent earlier to 220.74.  South Africa’s rand weakened against 31 most-traded peers
as the nation’s statistics agency reported  gross domestic
product  growth slowed to an annualized 0.9 percent, from 2.1
percent in the fourth quarter. The rand dropped 1.8 percent to
9.7847 per dollar and reached 9.8086, the weakest level since
March 2009.  Dollar Index  The Dollar  Index (SPX) , which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, increased 0.7 percent to 84.263.  The Conference Board’s  confidence index  rose to 76.2, the
strongest since February 2008, from a revised 69 in April, data
from the New York-based research group showed today. The median
forecast called for an increase to 71.2.  The Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller index of property values
increased 10.9 percent in March from a year earlier, the biggest
gain since April 2006, a report showed in New York.  The Dollar Index climbed to 84.498 last week, the highest
since 2010, after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central
bank could cut the pace of asset purchases if officials see
indications of sustained growth. The Fed is buying $85 billion
of bonds a month under its quantitative-easing strategy to spur
growth, which tends to debase the U.S. currency.  Fed Bets  “At a time when the rest of the world’s economies are on
shaky ground, U.S. economic data continues to surprise to the
upside, making the dollar extremely attractive to global
investors,”  Kathy Lien , managing director of foreign exchange
at BK Asset Management, an investment advisory firm in New York,
wrote in a client note. “As U.S. economic data continues to
improve, expectations for tapering asset purchases by the Fed
will continue to build.”  Policy makers have said they’ll maintain stimulus until the
labor market shows significant improvement, as long as projected
inflation stays below 2.5 percent.  The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the personal-consumption expenditures deflator, fell 0.2 percent in April, a
Bloomberg survey forecast before the Commerce Department reports
the data this week.  Japan’s currency fell versus the dollar even as  yields  on
10-year Japanese  government bonds  rose eight basis points, or
0.08 percentage point, to 0.91 percent, approaching the 13-month
high of 1 percent they reached May 23. U.S. Treasury 10-year
note yields added 16 basis points to 2.17 percent, widening the
 gap  with the Japanese yields to 1.26 percentage points, the most
since April 4.  Japanese Stimulus  The  Bank of Japan  pledged April 4 to double bond buying in
an attempt to secure 2 percent inflation and drag the world’s
third-biggest economy out of 15 years of deflation.  BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda “should continue to trust in
his judgment and ease further” if needed, Koichi Hamada, a
retired Yale University professor advising Abe, said today. The
policy is working “as well or better than expected,” he said.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained as much as 1.5
percent before paring its advance to 0.6 percent. Japan’s Nikkei
225 stock average rose 1.2 percent.  The yen has lost 12 percent this year, the biggest decline
among the 10 developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar is the biggest gainer,
rising 5.9 percent, while the euro has climbed 2.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
