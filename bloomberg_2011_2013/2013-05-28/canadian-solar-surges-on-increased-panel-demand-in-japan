Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ) , the Ontario-based solar-panel company with manufacturing operations in
 China , rose to a 22-month high as surging demand in  Japan  helped
boost first-quarter shipments beyond the company’s forecast.  Canadian Solar gained 9 percent to $9.39 at the close in
New York, the highest since July 2011. The company has more than
doubled this year.  The company shipped 340 megawatts of modules in the first
quarter, Guelph, Ontario-based Canadian Solar said today in a
statement. That beat its March forecast of 290 megawatts to 310
megawatts.  Shipments to Japan swelled 76 percent from the fourth
quarter and accounted for 25 percent of Canadian Solar’s total
deliveries.  Solar demand in the world’s third-largest economy is
“strong” and is approaching an annual run-rate of 7 gigawatts
to 9 gigawatts,  Vishal Shah , a New York-based analyst for
Deutsche Bank AG, wrote in a note to investors yesterday.
 Germany  was the biggest solar market last year, with 7.6
gigawatts of panels installed, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Canadian Solar expects to ship 380 megawatts to 420
megawatts of panels in the current quarter, and as much as 40
percent may go to Japan. The country is promoting wider use of
solar power after the March 2011 disaster in Fukushima prompted
a reevaluation of nuclear energy.  Revenue fell 19 percent from a year earlier to $263.6
million. Sales in Japan may account for 30 percent of the
company’s total this year, Chief Executive Officer Shawn Qu said
today on a conference call with analysts.  “So far, we haven’t seen many brand-name competitors in
that market,” Qu said. Canadian Solar began selling panels
there in 2009, “earlier” than some rivals.  Sales in Japan were 9.3 percent of the company’s total last
year, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
