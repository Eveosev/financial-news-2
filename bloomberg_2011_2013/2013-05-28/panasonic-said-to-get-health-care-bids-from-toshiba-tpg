TPG Capital,  Toshiba Corp. (6502)  are among
bidders for  Panasonic Corp. (6752) â€™s health care unit, said people with
knowledge of the matter.  A deal may be valued at more than 100 billion yen ($978
million), one of the people said, asking not to be identified as
the information is private. The company drew offers from fewer
than 10 buyout funds in the first round of an auction, which
closed yesterday, the person said.  The maker of  Viera televisions  is considering a sale of its
health care and logistics units as it focuses on turning around
its consumer electronics business. Osaka-based Panasonic plans
to spend 250 billion yen on restructuring during the next two
years to end losses from sales of TVs, semiconductors, mobile
phones, circuit boards and optical devices.  Panasonic spokeswoman Megumi Kitagawa declined to comment
on the bidders. Spokesmen for Toshiba and TPG also declined to
comment. Reuters on May 24 reported that Toshiba and TPG were
among potential bidders for the unit, without  naming its
sources.  Proceeds from a sale of the unit, which sells
pharmaceuticals, runs blood banks and provides hospice care,
will help Panasonic meet its target to generate 200 billion yen
in cash-flow. The next round of bids for the business are likely
to be made in July, one person said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
