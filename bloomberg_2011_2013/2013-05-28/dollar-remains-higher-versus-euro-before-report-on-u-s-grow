The Dollar Index rose for a second
day before U.S. data tomorrow on first-quarter growth amid
speculation the Federal Reserve will curb monetary stimulus.  The Australian dollar fell to the weakest level since
October 2011 after the International Monetary Fund cut its
growth forecast for  China . A gauge of Asian currencies touched
an almost eight-month low on concern investors will repatriate
funds from  emerging markets  back to the U.S.  “The dollar is strong,” said  Marito Ueda , the senior
managing director at  FX Prime Corp. (8711) , a currency-margin company
in  Tokyo . “The U.S. economy is steadily recovering, and a
reduction in monetary easing appears to be coming into view.”  The Dollar Index, which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, added 0.3 percent to 84.349 at 6:50 a.m. in
 London . It reached 84.498 on May 23, the most since July 2010.  The dollar was little changed at $1.2845 per euro after
rising 0.6 percent yesterday. The yen traded at 131.57 per euro
from 131.59 and was little changed at 102.42 per dollar. The
Aussie fell 0.8 percent to 95.40 U.S. cents, after dropping to
95.36, the weakest since Oct. 5, 2011.  The U.S. Commerce Department is likely to say tomorrow the
world’s biggest economy grew at an annualized 2.5 percent pace
in the first quarter, according to the median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. It would be unchanged
from the preliminary reading released last month.  U.S. Growth  U.S. real gross domestic product will probably expand 2
percent this year, compared with a 0.5 percent contraction in
the euro region, a separate poll of economists shows.  Japan ’s
economy is estimated to grow 1.4 percent.  The Fed is currently buying $85 billion of government and
mortgage debt a month to hold borrowing costs down, a policy
known as quantitative easing. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said
on May 22 that the central bank may cut the pace of bond
purchases in the next few meetings if policy makers see
indications of sustained improvement in economic growth.  “Tapering of QE will start probably in September,
October,” Bob Parker, who helps oversee about $400 billion in
London as senior adviser at Credit Suisse Asset Management, said
in a Bloomberg Television interview. “As we go into the middle
of 2014, QE will be finished.”  The dollar has risen 6.1 percent this year, the most among
the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The yen has slumped 12 percent,
and the euro has advanced 3 percent.  Aussie Dollar  Yields (USGG10YR)  on 10-year Treasury notes reached 2.23 percent
today, a level unseen since April 2012. The  extra yield  that
investors can get by holding  Australia ’s 10-year notes instead
of similar-maturity U.S. debt narrowed to 1.16 percentage points
yesterday, the lowest since November 2008.  China’s economy will grow about 7.75 percent this year and
next, David Lipton, first deputy managing director of the IMF,
said today at a press briefing in Beijing after concluding an
annual review of the country. In April, the IMF forecast growth
of 8 percent this year and 8.2 percent expansion in 2014.  “The diminishing yield differential is one argument for
the Aussie’s move lower,” said Michael Turner, a debt
strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in Sydney. “There certainly
seems to be some downside risk to growth in Australia.”  The  Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index (ADXY) , which tracks the
10 most-active currencies in the region excluding the yen, was
little changed at 116.83. It earlier dropped to as low as
116.81, a level unseen since Sept. 27.  “What we’re experiencing now is a round of dollar buying
that’s prompted by the rise in U.S. yields, as there’s been
expectations for when the Fed could withdraw liquidity from the
marketplace,” said Thio Chin Loo, a senior currency analyst at
BNP Paribas SA in  Singapore .  To contact the reporter on this story:
