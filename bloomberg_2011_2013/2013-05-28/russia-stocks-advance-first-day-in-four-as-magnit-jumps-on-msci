Russian  equities  rose for the first
time in four days, led by consumer stocks as MSCI Inc. boosted
the weighting of OAO Magnit, the country’s biggest food
retailer, in its benchmark index for the country.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  increased 0.8 percent to 1,389.42 by 10:44
a.m. in Moscow. Consumer services shares led the advance among
nine industry groups, adding 2.1 percent. Magnit jumped as much
as 5.1 percent, trading up 2.8 percent to 7,330 rubles.  MSCI lifted the weighting of OAO Magnit’s global depositary
receipts to 9 percent from 4.7 percent in its  Russia  10/40
Index, replacing OAO Mobile TeleSystems’ American depositary
receipts and AFK Sistema’s GDRs in the gauge’s top four,
according to an e-mailed note from Sberbank CIB. VTB Capital
estimates the size of potential fund inflows into Magnit GDRs at
$331 million, according to today’s note.  “Magnit is rising on the MSCI reweighting news,” Oleg Popov, who manages about $1 billion in assets for Allianz
Investments, the asset management arm of  Europe ’s biggest
insurer, said by phone from Moscow. “Speculators are buying the
stock to sell it at a higher price after the rebalancing takes
effect to the funds that track MSCI and are forced to adjust
their portfolios.”  The volume of shares traded on the Micex was 6.8 percent
below the 30-day average, while 10-day price swings increased to
28.802 from 28.762 yesterday. Crude slipped 0.5 percent to
$93.71 a barrel in  New York .  MSCI reduced MTS’s ADRs and Sistema’s GDRs combined
weighting in the 10/40 index to 4.5 percent, according to
today’s note from Sberbank CIB. The rebalancing will take effect
June 3. MTS rose 0.4 percent to 262.75 rubles. Sistema was
little changed at 26.902 rubles.  Stimulus Concern  Magnit surged 2.3 percent to $56.85 in  London , while
Sistema added 0.2 percent to $19.94.  The Micex tumbled the most in a year on May 23, after
manufacturing in  China  unexpectedly contracted and as concern
the U.S. Federal Reserve will crimp stimulus measures curbed
appetite for riskier assets.  Russian  consumer spending  grew less than economists
estimated last month, adding to evidence that the economy is
losing steam, according to data released on May 24. The central
bank kept its  main interest rates  unchanged for an eighth month
in May amid accelerating inflation.  Outgoing Bank Rossii Chairman Sergey Ignatiev has limited
room for policy easing with inflation more than a percentage
point above target, putting Russia at odds with an international
push for monetary stimulus this month. Bank Rossii is scheduled
to meet on  interest rates  in the first half of June, just before
Ignatiev steps down to be replaced by  Elvira Nabiullina , a
former economy minister and aide to President  Vladimir Putin , on
June 24.  Cheapest Valuations  Russia’s equities have the cheapest valuations among 21
 emerging markets  tracked by Bloomberg. The Micex trades at 5.2
times its 12-month estimated earnings and has lost 5.8 percent
this year, compared with a 10.5 multiple for the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index, which has dropped 2.4 percent in the period.  The dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  increased 0.7 percent to
1,394.45. The Russian Volatility Index dropped 2.9 percent to
23.46. The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Russian companies in the U.S. retreated 0.7 percent to 92.01 on
May 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
