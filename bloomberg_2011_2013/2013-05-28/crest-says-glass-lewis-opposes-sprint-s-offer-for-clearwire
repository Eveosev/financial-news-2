(Corrects Crest’s holding in first paragraph).  Crest Financial Ltd., an investor in
 Clearwire Corp. (CLWR) , said Glass, Lewis & Co., a proxy-advisory firm,
is opposed to  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) ’s sweetened offer for the
wireless carrier.  Crest commended  Glass Lewis  for recommending a vote against
the proposed merger, it said in a statement today.  “Glass Lewis’s independent analysis and expert opinion
confirm our view that Sprint is continuing to divert value away
from Clearwire and toward Sprint,” David Schumacher, general
counsel of Crest, said in the statement. “As Glass Lewis has
pointed out, in pursuing this transaction with Sprint,
Clearwire’s board of directors has shown ‘sharply
disproportionate deference to the interests of Sprint,’”
Schumacher said.  Sprint last week increased its bid by 14 percent for full
control of Clearwire as it sought to persuade opponents of the
takeover to accept the deal and fend off a competing offer from
Dish Network Corp. After the increased offer, Crest, a Houston-based firm, and a group of investors led by Mount Kellett
Capital Management LP both filed letters calling for
shareholders to reject the new terms.  Crest said Glass Lewis questioned Clearwire’s review of
alternative offers and the “only proper response from Clearwire
shareholders is to vote down the still-inadequate offer by
Sprint and wait until the contest for control of Sprint is
resolved.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
