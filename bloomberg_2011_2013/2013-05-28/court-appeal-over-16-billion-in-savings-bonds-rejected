The U.S. Supreme Court refused to
question the federal government’s custody of more than $16
billion in unredeemed, decades-old U.S. savings bonds, turning
down an appeal by five states.  The justices today left intact a federal appeals court
decision that said the states couldn’t use their unclaimed-property laws to take custody of the savings bonds. The three-judge panel said states can’t interfere with the contract
between the federal government and the bondholders.  Montana , Kentucky, Oklahoma, Missouri and Pennsylvania
pressed the lawsuit against the U.S. Treasury, joined by  North
Carolina  and New Jersey at earlier stages in the case. The seven
states sought custody of $1.6 billion in bonds owned by people
whose last known address was in one of those states.  The states say the U.S. government holds 40 million savings
bonds that no longer earn interest. Some date back as far as
1941, when they were issued to raise money for World War II.  The case is Montana v. Department of the Treasury, 12-926.  To contact the reporter on this story:
