Greentech Energy Systems A/S (GES) , a
Danish renewable-power developer, is set to make its first U.S.
investment as weakening growth in Europe prompts expansion
overseas.  The company will invest in a solar park near  Palm Springs ,
California, Chief Executive Officer Sigieri Diaz Pallavicini
said today by telephone. The Copenhagen-based developer plans to
make the investment through a venture with Britain’s Foresight
Group LLP this half, he said.  Greentech is seeking assets outside Europe as debt-strapped
nations including Spain and Italy scale back support for solar
power to stem costs. It agreed in March to work with Foresight
to invest in an initial 100 megawatts of solar in the U.S.,
where new capacity may rise as much as 22 percent to 3,900
megawatts this year, Bloomberg New Energy Finance data show.  The solar park targeted by Greentech has a capacity of
about 8 to 10 megawatts, Diaz Pallavicini said from  Rome . The
company is studying more projects, mostly in California, which
offers incentives to develop solar technology. It also intends
to expand into Mexico, Japan, South Africa and the  Middle East .  Greentech will raise finance as it targets an expansion to
1,000 megawatts of renewable power by 2014 from 318.3 megawatts
at the end of March, Diaz Pallavicini said, without elaborating.
It also plans to grow through acquisitions following a failed
bid to buy Spain’s  Fersa Energias Renovables SA (FRS)  in July, and is
studying northern Europe and Italy, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
