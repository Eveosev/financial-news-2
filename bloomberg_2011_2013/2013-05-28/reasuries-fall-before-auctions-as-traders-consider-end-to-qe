Treasuries fell, extending their
biggest loss in more than two years, before a report forecast to
show U.S.  consumer confidence  jumped in May to a six-month high,
fueling bets the  Federal Reserve  will slow monetary stimulus.  Treasury 10-year yields traded at almost the highest level
since March before the U.S. auctions $35 billion of two-year
notes in the first of three sales this week totaling $99
billion. Government securities have lost 1.3 percent in May, set
for the steepest drop since December 2010, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
last week the central bank may cut the pace of asset purchases
if officials see indications of sustained economic growth.  “The focus is going to be on supply,” said  Sean Murphy , a
trader at Societe Generale SA in New York, one of the 21 primary
dealers that trade with the Fed. “That’s probably the majority
of why we’re softer. You’re probably seeing a little more
reaction to Bernanke’s comments.”  Benchmark 10-year  yields  climbed four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 2.05 percent at 8:43 a.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The 1.75 percent note
due May 2023 slid 11/32, or $3.44 per $1,000 face amount, to 97
10/32. The yield reached 2.07 percent on May 23, the highest
level since March 14.  Trade in U.S.  government securities  was closed yesterday
for a holiday.  Yield Indications  The two-year notes scheduled for sale today yielded 0.26
percent in pre-auction trading, up from a rate of 0.233 percent
at a previous sale on April 23.  The U.S. is due to auction $35 billion of five-year debt
tomorrow and $29 billion of seven-year securities on May 30.  Trading volume at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker
of  U.S. government debt , surged to $662.3 billion on May 22, the
day Bernanke said in testimony to Congress that policy makers
may cut the pace of bond purchases at the next few meetings if
they see signs the economy’s growth is sustainable. That was the
highest level in data going back to 2004. The previous high was
$621.8 billion in August 2007. ICAP’s average daily volume for
this year has been $292.8 billion.  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage debt
a month, a policy known as quantitative easing, to support the
economy by putting downward pressure on borrowing costs. The
central bank plans to buy as much as $1.75 billion of Treasuries
maturing from February 2036 to May 2043 today.  Fed Outlook  “If we see continued improvement and we have confidence
that that is going to be sustained, then we could in -- in the
next few meetings -- we could take a step down in our pace of
purchases,” Bernanke told lawmakers last week.  The Conference Board’s sentiment  index  climbed to 71.2 this
month from 68.1 in April, according to the median prediction of
75 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. That would be the
highest reading since November’s 71.5.  The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values increased
10.9 percent from March 2012, the biggest 12-month gain since
April 2006, after advancing 9.4 percent in February, a report
showed today in  New York . The median projection of 30 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 10.2 percent advance.  Unemployment at 7.5 percent and a 1.1 percent inflation
rate are helping keep yields and volatility in check.  “Coming into this week, sentiment in bond markets wasn’t
good as we tested important levels already” in both Treasuries
and German bunds, said Piet Lammens, head of research at KBC
Bank NV in Brussels. “The decline in bond markets was already
well under way when Bernanke spoke but certainly it helped.”  Inflation Expectations  Treasury declines may accelerate should the 10-year yield
jump above a possible cluster of buy orders at 2.09 percent,
with the risk that rates may climb toward 2.40 percent, Lammens
said.  Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities show investors
anticipate an average increase of 2.27 percent in consumer
prices for the next decade, up from 2.23 percent on May 23,
which was the least since Aug. 9.  The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the personal
consumption expenditures deflator, fell in April for a second
month by 0.2 percent, according to the median forecast of 32
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The  Bureau of Economic
Analysis  will report the data May 31.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE Index, which tracks
option projections for the pace of swings in Treasuries maturing
in two to 30 years, fell to a record 48.87 on May 9. The index
rose to as high as 68.2 last week, below the average of 96.6
since 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
