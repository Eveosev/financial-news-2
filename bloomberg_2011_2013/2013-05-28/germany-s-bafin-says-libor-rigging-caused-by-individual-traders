German markets regulator Bafin said
its probe into the involvement of local banks in manipulating
benchmark lending rates, including Libor, suggests that rigging
wasn’t the result of “systematic criminality.”  “We are very closely looking at the German participants
and have conducted special checks,” Elke Koenig, the president
of Bonn-based Bafin, said at a conference in the city today.
“We don’t have final results yet but I can say one thing: So
far it doesn’t look like we are faced with systematic
criminality in  Germany . It seems more to be about single
traders.”  The setting of benchmark rates has faced a wave of
criticism after U.S. and U.K. regulators uncovered widespread
attempts by banks to manipulate the London interbank offered
rate, or Libor. Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, UBS AG, and
Barclays Plc have been fined about $2.5 billion and at least a
dozen firms, including Frankfurt-based  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , remain
under investigation.  Deutsche Bank has suspended or fired at least seven people
over alleged inappropriate behavior related to interbank rate
submissions, people familiar with the matter said in February.
Neither Deutsche Bank’s internal rates probe nor that of Bafin
have found evidence that current or former management board
members engaged in wrongdoing, officials at the bank and the
regulator have said.  “In retrospect, I wonder how one could ever think that
something like this is not going to happen,” Koenig said.
Euribor, the benchmark rate tied to the euro, and Libor “remain
susceptible to manipulation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
