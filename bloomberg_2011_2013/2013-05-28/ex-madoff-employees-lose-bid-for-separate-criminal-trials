Five ex-employees of Bernard L.
Madoff Investment Securities LLC lost a bid to be tried
separately on criminal charges connected to their work for the
confidence man.  U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain in Manhattan today
denied requests that she hold separate trials of the defendants
or split off some of the charges from a trial scheduled to begin
Oct. 7. Swain today granted some requests by the defense for
pretrial production of evidence by U.S. prosecutors.  Daniel Bonventre, Annette Bongiorno, Joann Crupi, Jerome O’Hara and  George Perez , all former longtime Madoff employees,
are charged with crimes including conspiracy, fraud and
falsifying records. They have pleaded not guilty.  Prosecutors in the office of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in
Manhattan filed a new 33-count indictment in October alleging
the five were part of a conspiracy to defraud investors that got
its start in the early 1970s.  Madoff, 75, was arrested in 2008 and pleaded guilty to
running the biggest  Ponzi scheme  in history. He’s serving a 150-year sentence in federal prison in  North Carolina .  The case is U.S. v. O’Hara, 10-cr-00228, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
