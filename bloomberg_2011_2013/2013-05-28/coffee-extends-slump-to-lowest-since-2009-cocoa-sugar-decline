Coffee futures extended a slump that
sent prices to the lowest since 2009 on signs of ample supply.
Cocoa fell to a seven-week low, and sugar declined from a one-week high.  Global supplies of coffee will exceed demand for the second
straight year amid bumper crops in  Brazil , the world’s top
producer, according to Volcafe, a unit of commodities trader
ED&F Man Holdings Ltd. Brazilian farmers will harvest a record
57.8 million bags in the 2013-2014 season, Volcafe estimated. A
bag weighs 132 pounds (60 kilograms). Prices plunged 12 percent
in the previous two weeks and are headed for the biggest monthly
drop since October.  “For the time being, with everything being ideal weather-wise, and with the harvest getting started here soon, we should
see prices move sideways to lower here,”  Boyd Cruel , a market
analyst at Vision Financial Markets in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview. “Production is going to look positive.”  Arabica coffee for July delivery fell 0.6 percent to close
at $1.2645 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York ,
after touching $1.258, the lowest for the most-active contract
since Sept. 30, 2009.  Cocoa futures for July delivery declined 1.8 percent to
$2,205 a metric ton in New York, after touching $2,201, the
lowest for a most-active contract since April 9.  Raw-sugar futures for delivery in July fell 0.7 percent to
16.72 cents a pound on ICE, after touching 17 cents, the highest
since May 20.  Sugar output in Brazil’s Center South, the nation’s main
growing region, more than doubled in the first half of May from
a year earlier, Unica, a Sao Paulo-based industry group, said
today. Production totaled 2.06 million tons in the period, up
from 1.02 million a year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
