Biological warfare defense firms  Siga
Technologies Inc. (SIGA)  and  PharmAthene Inc. (PIP)  rose after a court upheld
Siga’s liability over a disputed smallpox-medicine licensing
agreement while throwing out a potential multibillion-dollar
damages ruling for PharmAthene.  The  Delaware Supreme Court ’s May 24 decision prompted Siga
to rise as much as 9.3 percent to $4 today in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading. PharmAthene surged as much as 38 percent to
$2.20 on the New York Stock Exchange.  The state’s highest court upheld a judge’s 2011 finding
that Siga violated promises to negotiate in good faith over a
license for ST-246, an antiviral drug for use in case of a
biological attack. The appeals court also ordered the judge to
reconsider the amount of damages PharmAthene can recover.  Siga executives’ bad-faith negotiations were prompted by
“seller’s remorse” over giving up control of “what was
looking more and more like a multibillion-dollar drug,” Chief
Justice Myron Steele wrote in a 42-page ruling.  Delaware Chancery Court Judge Donald Parsons will now have
to reassess how much in “contract-expectation damages”
PharmAthene may recover from Siga for violating promises to
properly negotiate the licensing agreement, Steele said.  Siga climbed 4.6 percent to $3.83 at 9:52 a.m. in  New York ,
valuing the company at $199.6 million. PharmAthene gained 26
percent to $2.01, boosting its market value to $99.4 million.  ‘Positive Decision’  “We are pleased by this positive decision from the
Delaware Supreme Court,” Eric Richman, PharmAthene’s president
and chief executive officer, said in a May 26 e-mailed
statement. “We look forward to final resolution of the case.”  Siga officials said in a May 26 statement that they will
argue before Parsons that PharmAthene’s contract-expectation
damage claims are flawed.  “PharmAthene’s evidence of expectancy damages is
speculative and too uncertain, contingent, and conjectural to
permit an award,”  William Haynes II , Siga’s general counsel,
said in an e-mailed statement.  PharmAthene, a developer of biological and chemical defense
products based in Annapolis,  Maryland , sued New York-based
competitor Siga in 2006, claiming it had a licensing agreement
for the medicine. PharmAthene’s attorneys argued it should share
in as much as $5 billion in  potential sales , mostly from
government contracts for ST-246.  Licensing Agreement  Parsons ruled in 2011 that PharmAthene was entitled to
50 percent of profit from sales of ST-246 once Siga earned a
profit of $40 million because of Siga executives’ bad-faith
negotiations over the licensing agreement.  Siga officials said last year that the company won a five-year U.S. government contract for 2 million doses of ST-246 in a
deal that could be worth as much as $2.8 billion.  In its lawsuit, PharmAthene argued it had a claim to
ST-246’s profits because it helped fund the drug’s development
and Siga reneged on promises to grant a licensing agreement.  Lawyers for Siga argued at trial the licensing talks were
never completed and documents outlining proposed terms were
marked as “non-binding.” A PharmAthene official said in court
that the heading was left on the documents by mistake.  PharmAthene’s attorneys argued during a two-week trial that
Siga was running out of money to develop ST-246 in late 2005
when it proposed a merger or license agreement.  Companies Negotiated  PharmAthene executives ultimately loaned Siga $3 million to
keep the drug’s development going while the two companies
negotiated, according to court testimony. PharmAthene claimed
that ex-Siga Chairman  Donald Drapkin  guaranteed the companies
would either merge or Siga would grant PharmAthene a license for
the medicine.  Drapkin, a former executive of billionaire  Ronald Perelman ’s MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings Inc. holding company,
countered during the trial that he never promised PharmAthene
officials a license.  The terms sheet relied upon by PharmAthene’s lawyers as
evidence of a contract between the two firms was intended as a
“jumping off point” for negotiations if merger talks faltered,
Drapkin said.  The Delaware appeals court upheld Parsons’ finding that the
term sheet and other evidence in the case showed Drapkin and
other Siga executives agreed to hold good-faith negotiations
over the licensing agreement.  Although the term sheet “is not signed and contains a
footer on each page stating” it contains nonbinding terms, the
combination with other agreements covering loans and a potential
merger made it an enforceable contract, the  Supreme Court  found.  The case is Siga Technologies v. PharmAthene, 12-00314,
Delaware Supreme Court. The Chancery Court case is PharmAthene
Inc. v. Siga Technologies Inc., CA2627, Delaware Chancery Court
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
