F.A. Cup-winning coach  Roberto
Martinez  is to leave Wigan soccer team and may join Everton, Sky
Sports reported.  Martinez told Wigan Chairman Dave Whelan of his desire to
quit at a meeting today, Sky said. Heâ€™s been at Wigan four years
after moving there from Swansea.  Wigan this month become the first club to win the F.A. Cup
and be relegated from the Premier League in the same season,
after an eight-year spell in the top flight.  Everton is seeking a new manager after the departure of
David Moyes, who is succeeding  Alex Ferguson  at Manchester
United.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
