Lithuanian Economy Minister Birute Vesaite will step down next week after making an ethical
“mistake” in letting a company partially finance a trip to
Kazakhstan last week, Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevicius said.  Vesaite “didn’t think” about the potential conflict of
interest and will leave on June 3, Butkevicius said today on LRT
public radio, citing a decision of the Baltic nation’s four
ruling coalition parties.  Butkevicius heads the Social Democrat Party, which
initiated Vesaite’s appointment in December after elections.
Vesaite, who denies wrongdoing, has said she’d quit if the
premier asked her to. She’d be the first member of the Cabinet
to resign.  To contact the reporter on this story:
