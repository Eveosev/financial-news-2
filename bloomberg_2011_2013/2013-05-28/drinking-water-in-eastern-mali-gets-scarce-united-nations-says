Drinking water in eastern Mali is
becoming scarce as pumps are in disrepair and power cuts are
disrupting supplies, according to the  United Nations .  Available potable water in Gao, 1,200 kilometers (745
miles) from the capital Bamako, has fallen 60 percent in recent
weeks while concerns grow that cholera outside the city will
spread, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Mali said in an e-mail. It’s “imperative” the supply is restored so 70,000
residents have safe drinking water, Aurelien Agbenonci said.  With many using river water, health workers registered 22
cases of cholera in May, Agbenonci said today. Two died of the
disease, transmitted through infected water or contaminated
food. In Niger, 250 cases of cholera have been treated among
Mali refugees, the Doctors Without Borders group said last week.  Gao has been the scene of fighting between Islamist
insurgents and  Mali  government troops after extremist rebels
last year seized the northern half of the impoverished West
African country in a bid to impose sharia law. The Malian army
said in February it regained control of the area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
