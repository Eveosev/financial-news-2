Vietnam ’s bonds rose, pushing
benchmark yields lower for a fifth day, on speculation banks
increased their holdings as lending slowed. The dong was steady.  The overnight  interbank deposit rate  has slumped to 0.94
percent from a 2013 high of 4.5 percent on Jan. 2, according to
daily fixings by banks compiled by Bloomberg, amid weak credit
growth. Bank loans increased 2.29 percent this year through May
22, the central bank said on its website yesterday. That
compares with the authority’s full-year target of 12 percent.  The yield on five-year notes dropped 15 basis points, or
0.15 percentage point, to 7.97 percent in Hanoi, according to
daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The rate on
three-year notes fell 11 basis points to 6.97 percent, the
lowest since June 2007.  “Demand for bonds is strong because yields are still at
pretty attractive levels compared with  interest rates  in the
interbank market,” said Nguyen Thi Ngoc Anh, head of fixed-income trading at Asia Commercial Bank in  Ho Chi Minh City .  The dong traded at 20,998 per dollar as of 4 p.m. in Hanoi,
little changed from yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The  State Bank  of Vietnam set its  reference rate  at
20,828, unchanged since December 2011, according to its website.
The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either
side of the fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
