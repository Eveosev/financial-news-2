     May 29 (Bloomberg) -- Treasury’s $35 billion sale of two-year debt attracted the fewest bids for the securities since
February 2011 after reports showed stronger-than-forecast
economic data, damping demand for refuge assets.  The bid-to-cover  ratio , which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 3.04,
compared with an average of 3.72 for the past 10 sales. The
benchmark 10-year note yield rose earlier after a report showed
 consumer confidence  in May reached the strongest in more than
five years while Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
last week the central bank could cut the pace of asset purchases
if officials see indications of sustained improvement in
economic growth.  “It was a disappointing auction,” said Aaron Kohli, an
interest-rate strategist BNP Paribas SA in  New York , one of 21
primary dealers that are obligated to bid at U.S. government
debt offerings. “Everyone’s scared of catching a falling
knife.”  The current two-year note yield climbed four basis points,
or 0.04 percentage point, to 0.29 percent in New York, according
to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The 0.125 percent note due April
2015 slid 2/32, or 63 cents per $1,000 face amount, to 99 22/32.  The 10-year yield reached 2.17 percent, the highest level
since April 6, 2012.  Note Auction  At the auction, the two-year notes drew a yield of 0.283
percent, compared with a forecast of 0.277 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of seven primary dealers.  Non-primary dealers bought the  fewest  of the $35 billion
two-year notes since April 2009, with indirect bidders, an
investor class that includes foreign central banks, purchasing
21.9 percent of the notes, and direct bidders buying 12.6
percent, the least since July.  Indirect bidders have averaged  winning  24.7 percent for the
past 10 sales while  direct  bidders have won an average 24.5
percent of the last 10 offerings. Primary dealers were awarded
65.5 percent of the offering.  “They got more than they expected, and that’s usually a
bad sign for price action following the auction,” Kohli said.  Two-year notes have gained 0.1 percent this year, compared
with a decline of 0.5 percent by Treasuries overall, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The two-year
securities returned 0.3 percent in 2012, while Treasuries
overall rose 2.2 percent.  The offering was the first of three note auctions this week
totaling $99 billion. The government will sell $35 billion in
five-year debt today and $29 billion in seven-year securities
tomorrow.  The sales, including the Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities offering last week, will raise $53.54 billion of new
cash, as maturing securities held by the public total $58.46
billion, according to the  U.S. Treasury .  To contact the reporter on this story:
