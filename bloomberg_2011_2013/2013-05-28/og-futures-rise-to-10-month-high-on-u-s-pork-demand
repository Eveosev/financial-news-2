Hog futures rose to a 10-month high
on speculation that demand for U.S. pork will increase with beef
costs close to a nine-year high. Cattle prices also gained.  Wholesale pork  at 94.42 cents a pound is 55 percent less
than  beef  at $2.0887 a pound, the latest U.S. Department of
Agriculture data showed on May 24. A day earlier, beef reached
$2.1137, the highest since at least January 2004.  “Pork has a lot of advantages just being the cheaper
meat,”  Christian Mayer , a market analyst at Northstar Commodity
Investments in  Minneapolis , said in a telephone interview.  Hog futures for July settlement climbed 0.6 percent to
93.85 cents a pound at 10:56 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Earlier, the price reached 94 cents, the highest for a
most-active contract since July 9.  Cattle futures for August delivery rose 0.2 percent to
$1.19425 a pound.  Through May 24, hogs advanced 8.8 percent this year, and
cattle dropped 9.9 percent.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement declined 0.2
percent to $1.442 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
