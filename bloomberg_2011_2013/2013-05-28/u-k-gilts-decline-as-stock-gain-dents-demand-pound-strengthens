U.K. government bonds declined,
sending 10-year gilt yields to a more-than two-month high, as
gains in stocks damped demand for the relative safety of fixed-income assets.  Two-year yields climbed to the highest since February as
U.K equities advanced the most in five weeks. Gilts extended
declines and the pound fell versus the dollar after data showed
U.S. home prices gained the most in seven years. The pound
strengthened against the euro after posting a fourth weekly
slide last week on speculation the Bank of England would boost
stimulus measures that debase the currency. Index-linked bonds
are headed for their biggest losses since September.  “The strength of stocks are providing an excuse for some
investors to sell low-yielding government bonds across markets
including gilts,” said Robin Marshall, director of fixed income
at Smith & Williamson Investment Management in London. “There’s
some evidence that the U.K. economy, while remaining weak, is
stabilizing and that probably on the margin eases demand for
safer assets.”  The yield on Britain’s 10-year gilts rose six basis points,
or 0.06 percentage point, to 1.97 percent at 4:38 p.m. London
time, the most since March 15. The 1.75 percent bond due
September 2022 dropped 0.47 or 4.70 pounds per 1,000-pound
($1,507) face amount, to 98.17.  Two-year yields were at 0.37 percent after climbing to 0.38
percent, the  highest  since Feb. 14. The FTSE 100  index  advanced
1.6 percent, set for its biggest daily increase since April 23.  Gilts Decline  Gilts handed investors a loss of 1.7 percent this month,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds dropped
1.2 percent and Treasuries fell 1.3 percent.  Inflation-linked gilts lost 2 percent from the end of April
through May 24, poised for their worst month since September,
indexes compiled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch show.  The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values increased
10.9 percent in the 12 months through March, the most since
April 2006. The Conference Board’s index of consumer sentiment
climbed more than forecast to 76.2, the strongest level in more
than five years.  The pound appreciated 0.2 percent to 85.45 pence per euro
after sliding 1 percent last week. Sterling dropped 0.2 percent
to $1.5070, reversing an earlier gain. It climbed 0.9 percent to
153.80 yen.  Gains Limited  Further gains in sterling may be limited amid speculation
that fiscal tightening will leave the door open for further
quantitative easing even as data improved, according to
Athanasios Vamvakidis, head of Group-of-10 foreign-exchange
strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in  London . He
predicted the pound will be “range-bound” between $1.50 and
$1.54.  Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney will take over from
Mervyn King as Bank of England chief in July. The central bank
has bought 375 billion pounds of assets and instituted a co-called Funding for Lending Scheme of credit for small- and
medium-sized businesses to stimulate growth.  “We don’t expect Carney to come out with further
quantitative easing particularly because of the data surprises
and because of the Funding for Lending program, so we believe
they will give it some time to see the effect on the economy,”
Vamvakidis said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “On
the Move” with  Francine Lacqua . “Given that fiscal policy will
remain tight, the discussion for further loosening from the Bank
of England will remain.”  The pound has slumped 2.9 percent this year, the second-worst performer after the yen among 10-developed-nation
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The dollar gained 5.6 percent and the euro rose 2.8 percent.  U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said today
he has reached an agreement with seven government departments to
cut spending by as much as 10 percent for the 2015-2016 fiscal
year. He is scheduled to announce his spending plans for that
period in Parliament in London on June 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
