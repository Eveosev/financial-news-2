Australia ’s Queensland state is
seeking bids for as much as 7,200 megaliters (1.9 billion
gallons) of unallocated water reserves from the Great Artesian
Basin.  “This release process builds on the Newman government’s
commitment to support and grow Queensland’s agricultural sector
as one of the key pillars of the state economy,” Andrew Cripps,
the state’s minister for natural resources and mines, said today
in an e-mailed statement.  Tender applications will close on July 26 and offers will
be made by the end of the year, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
