Tuomas Rautanen, head of regulatory
affairs and consulting at First Climate AG in Zurich, will leave
the company on May 31.  Rautanen, 34, resigned for personal reasons, he said today
by phone. Urs Brodmann, a member of the company’s executive
board, will take over his duties until a successor has been
appointed,  Rautanen said. He joined the company as a senior
analyst in 2008 and was promoted to his current role in 2011.  First Climate is a carbon asset manager and offset
supplier. It also invests in water projects and offers
consulting services related to climate policy and emissions
trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
