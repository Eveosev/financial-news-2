South African white corn futures
gained to a four-week high as a drop in the rand against the
dollar made imports more expensive.  White corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
rose 1 percent to 2,228 rand ($230) a metric ton, the highest
settlement since April 30. The yellow variety for delivery the
same month rose 1.4 percent to 2,211.20 rand a ton.  The rand weakened to a four-year low after a report that
economic growth in South Africa slowed in the first quarter. The
rand fell 1.1 to 9.7166 per dollar.  “The weak rand has affected today’s price,” Brink van Wyk, a trader at BVG (Pty) Ltd., said by phone from  Pretoria .  South Africa is the continent’s biggest producer of the
grain. Meal made from white corn is one of the nation’s staple
food and the yellow variety is mainly used as animal feed.  The nation exported 47,075 tons of white corn to  Mexico  in
the week to May 24, the Pretoria-based South African Grain
Information Service said.  Wheat for delivery in July rose 0.4 percent to 3,589 rand a
ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
