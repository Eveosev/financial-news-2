Real Madrid president Florentino
Perez said signing Brazilian forward Neymar would have been too
costly for his club, the world’s richest soccer team by sales.  The 21-year-old player for  Brazil ’s Santos said May 26 he
agreed to join Barcelona after 230 games with his current club.
Financial terms weren’t disclosed by either team.  “He’s a magnificent player, we would have like to have
signed him under conditions that didn’t change the eco-system of
the club,” Perez told the Cadena Ser radio station. It was
“impossible” because of the financial demands of Neymar’s
father, Santos and Grupo Dis, which owned 40 percent of his
transfer rights, Perez said.  Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper  reported yesterday Barcelona
will pay Neymar 75 million euros ($97 million) over five years,
as well as a 28 million euro transfer fee.  Neymar’s signing would have cost Real  Madrid  more than 150
million euros to finance, Perez said.  Real paid a record transfer fee of 80 million pounds
($120.7 million) to sign Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester
United in 2009.  Barcelona, which last year budgeted to make a 29 million
euro profit for the 12 months through June, is the world’s
second-richest club by sales, according to Deloitte LLP.  To contact the reporters on this story:
