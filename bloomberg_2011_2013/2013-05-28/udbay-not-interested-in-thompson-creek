HudBay Minerals Inc. (HBM) , the developer
of the Constancia copper mine in  Peru , isn’t interested in
Thompson Creek Metals Co. as it looks for possible acquisitions.  HudBay’s search is focused on projects that it can develop
itself, Chief Executive Officer David Garofalo said. Thompson
Creek, a molybdenum producer that’s building a copper mine in
British Columbia, doesn’t meet Toronto-based HudBay’s criteria,
Garofalo said today in a phone interview.  There has been “chatter” about HudBay “kicking the
tires” on Littleton, Colorado-based Thompson Creek, Garrett Nelson, an analyst at BB&T Capital Markets, said in a note
today. The combination of the companies would make strategic
sense, he said.  “Our criteria for growth are quite clear in terms of
greenfield projects,” Garofalo said. “I wish Thompson Creek
very well but there’s no truth to the rumors.”  A Thomson Creek spokeswoman declined to comment on
speculation about the company being a takeover target.  Thompson Creek rose 6.5 percent to $3.76 at 11:57 a.m. in
New York. HudBay gained 3.6 percent to C$8.64 in Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
