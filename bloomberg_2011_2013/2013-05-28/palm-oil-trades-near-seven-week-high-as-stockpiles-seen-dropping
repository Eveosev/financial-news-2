Palm oil  climbed to the highest level
in almost seven weeks on speculation that stockpiles in  Malaysia 
may drop for a fifth month as output declines in the world’s
second-biggest producer.  The contract for August delivery advanced as much as 0.4
percent to 2,391 ringgit ($787) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives, the highest level for the most active
contract since April 10, and ended the morning session at 2,384
ringgit. Futures are up 4.3 percent this month, heading for the
first monthly gain in four, on expectation demand may rebound
ahead of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, which starts in
July this year.  Malaysian  reserves  have dropped 27 percent to 1.93 million
tons last month from a record in December, according to data
from the nation’s palm oil board. Output rose 3.1 percent to
1.37 million tons in April, board data shows.  “The market talk is that the production is down 4 to 5
percent in the first 20 days of this month -- this is below what
the planters expected,” Chandran Sinnasamy, head of trading at
LT International Futures Sdn., said by phone from  Kuala Lumpur .
“That’s providing underlying support for the market.”  Inventories may drop about 8 percent this month if output
falls and exports remain little changed, Chandran said.  Shipments from Malaysia fell 2.1 percent to 1.06 million
tons in the first 25 days of May from the same period in April,
surveyor  Societe Generale  de Surveillance said yesterday. That
compares with an 18 percent decline in the first 10 days.  Refined palm oil for September delivery gained 0.3 percent
to 6,148  yuan  ($1,004) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange ,
while soybean oil fell 0.5 percent to 7,480 yuan.  On the Chicago Board of Trade, soybeans for July delivery
climbed 0.5 percent to $14.84 a bushel and  soybean oil  for the
same month rose 0.4 percent to 49.42 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
