Australia ’s dollar fell to the lowest
since October 2011 versus its U.S. peer after the 10-year yield
spread between the two countries’ debt narrowed to the least in
more than four years on signs the American economy is improving.  Local bonds fell, with the 10-year rate climbing to a 2-month high, after U.S. Treasury benchmark yields rose to the
most since April 2012. The Aussie weakened to a more-than four-year low against its New Zealand counterpart. Pacific Investment
Management Co., which runs the world’s biggest bond fund, said
it expects further interest rate cuts by the  Reserve Bank  of
Australia as mining investment cools.  “The diminishing yield differential is one argument for
the Aussie’s move lower,” said  Michael Turner , a debt
strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in Sydney. “There certainly
seems to be some downside risk to growth in Australia. The risk
is skewed for more easing by the RBA.”  The Australian dollar touched 95.36 U.S. cents, the weakest
since October 2011, before trading at 95.38 at 3:53 p.m. in
Sydney, 0.8 percent below yesterday’s close. It fell 0.6 percent
to NZ$1.1840 after earlier dropping to NZ$1.1837, the lowest
since January 2009. The Aussie weakened 0.8 percent to 97.78
yen. New Zealand’s dollar slid 0.2 percent to 80.57 U.S. cents
and lost 0.3 percent to 82.45 yen.  Australia’s  10-year bond  yield rose 15 basis points or 0.15
percentage point to 3.47 percent, after touching 3.5 percent,
the highest since March 27. The U.S. Treasury 10-year yield rose
to 2.23 percent today, a level unseen since April 2012. The
 spread  between the two narrowed to 116 basis points yesterday,
the least since November 2008.  U.S Economy  Data yesterday showed  consumer confidence  in the U.S.
climbed to the highest level in more than five years and  home
prices  advanced by the most in seven.  Interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg show traders
see a 32 percent chance the RBA will lower its benchmark to 2.5
percent at the next meeting on June 4.  “The expected decline in mining investment will likely
leave a significant economic hole in the short term that needs
to be filled,” portfolio managers Adam Bowe and  Robert Mead 
wrote in an article on Newport Beach, California-based Pimco’s
website. “We believe that lower  interest rates  will likely be
required to support domestic demand as Australia transitions
away from mining-assisted growth.”  Leading Indicator  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  and the Melbourne Institute said
today an Australian  index  of leading economic indicators for
March rose 0.2 percent to 290.3 from the previous month, when it
increased 0.6 percent.  The  value  of total construction work declined 2 percent in
the three months to March 31 after a revised 0.1 percent gain in
the previous quarter, the statistics bureau said today. That
compared with a 1 percent increase estimated by economists
surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  New Zealand ’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to
receive a flowing rate, was little changed at 3.01 percent.  “Investors are pricing in normalization from the RBNZ,”
RBC’s Turner said of New Zealand’s central bank. “ There are
some easily identifiable reasons to be positive in New Zealand,
whereas in Australia there’s a bit of uncertainty on how it will
shift away from the mining sector.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
