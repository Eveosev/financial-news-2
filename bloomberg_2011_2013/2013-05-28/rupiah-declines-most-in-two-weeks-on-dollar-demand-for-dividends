Indonesia ’s rupiah declined the most
in almost two weeks on speculation dollar demand will exceed
supply as local companies prepare to pay dividends in foreign
currencies.  Government bonds  fell.  PT Indika Energy (INDY)  will make a $19 million payment to
overseas shareholders and the country’s second-largest power-station coal producer PT Adaro Energy will provide $117 million,
according to company statements.  Global funds  pulled 70 billion
rupiah ($7.1 million) from Indonesian bonds last week, the first
reduction since the five days ended April 5, official data show.  “Banks are already collecting dollars in expectation of
demand from companies preparing to pay dividends,” said
Fahrudin Haris Prastowo, a foreign-exchange trader at PT Bank
Rakyat Indonesia. “The rupiah will be under pressure until it
strengthens again in July when the demand eases.”  The local currency fell 0.4 percent to 9,830 per dollar as
of 9:28 a.m. in Jakarta, the biggest drop since May 16,
according to prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. That
is the lowest level since May 17, when the rupiah reached 9,845,
the weakest since Jan. 10.  The spot rate traded at a 0.7 percent premium to its one-month non-deliverable forwards, which declined 0.2 percent to
9,901, data compiled by Bloomberg show. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate 
used to price options, fell 26 basis points, or 0.26 percentage
point, to 6.86 percent.  “ Bank Indonesia  continues to be present in the market to
monitor and maintain the rupiah’s stability,” Prastowo said.  The yield on government notes due May 2023 rose one basis
point to 5.87 percent, the highest level since Oct. 11, prices
from the Inter Dealer Market Association show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
