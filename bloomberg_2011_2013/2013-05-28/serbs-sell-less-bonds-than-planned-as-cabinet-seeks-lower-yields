Serbia  sold a quarter of bonds
offered today as the government sought to push yields further
down amid signs that investor interest for the country’s longer
debt maturities is waning.  The Debt Management Agency sold 1.26 billion dinars ($14.7
million) worth of five-year bonds maturing in 2018 with an
annual 10 percent coupon of 5 billion dinars being offered, the
Belgrade-based agency said in an e-mailed statement. Demand
stood at 2.1 billion dinars. Investors bid five times more, or
10.3 billion dinars, at a Jan. 22 auction, when the government
paid 12.94 percent for the same maturity. Bid yields today
ranged from 8.99 percent and 12.27 percent.  Investor demand for Serbia’s debt “has reflected
concerns” recently raised by the  International Monetary Fund 
about Serbia’s “fiscal slippage,” Hrvoje Stojic, chief analyst
at the Zagreb-based Hypo Alpe-Adria Bank d.d. said in an e-mail.
Reliance on external borrowing amid “stronger global and
regional risk appetite” has enabled a “better negotiating
position at local” auctions and “could still allow the  Finance
Ministry  to reject more expensive bids at auctions.”  The IMF said on May 22 that Serbia’s fiscal gap could soar
to 8 percent of gross domestic product under unchanged policies.
The government targeted a fiscal gap equivalent to 3.6 percent
of GDP.  The weaker-than-planned borrowing comes amid a
parliamentary debate, in which the Finance Ministry is trying to
win backing for a set of tax law amendments that would bring
savings worth 32 billion dinars, or 1 percent of economic
output.  Yields on the Serbian 10-year Eurobond maturing in 2021
rose to 5.3 percent by 3:31 p.m. in Belgrade today from 4.7
percent on May 22. The dinar traded at a one-month low of
111.3530 at 3:35 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
