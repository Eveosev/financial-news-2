The central bank of  Angola ,  Africa ’s
biggest oil producer after Nigeria, kept its benchmark interest
rate unchanged for a fourth month.  The key lending rate was left at 10 percent, the Luanda-based Banco Nacional de Angola said in an e-mailed statement.
The bank lowered the rate by a quarter of a percentage point in
January, only the second cut since it was introduced in October
2011.  Inflation slowed to 9 percent in April from 9.1 percent in
the previous month, the bank said.  The bank said it took into consideration the inflation
data, conditions in the economy and fiscal and monetary accounts
in order to “contribute to the maintenance of price
stability.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
