OAO Lukoil,  Russia ’s second-largest
oil producer, said first-quarter profit plunged 32 percent after
Urals prices declined and income tax rose.  Net income dropped to $2.58 billion in the first three
months of the year from $3.79 billion a year earlier, the
Moscow-based company said today in a statement. That missed the
$2.75 billion average adjusted estimate of nine analysts
surveyed by  Bloomberg News . Sales decreased 4.2 percent to $33.8
billion from $35.3 billion a year earlier.  Profit at Lukoil fell more than at Russia’s largest oil
company, OAO Rosneft, with a first-quarter slump of 13 percent,
and OAO Gazprom Neft, the country’s fourth-largest producer,
with a decline of 18 percent. The average price of Urals crude,
the nation’s benchmark export blend, declined more that 5
percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, Lukoil said.  Crude and gas output was little changed at 2.196 million
barrels of oil equivalent a day in the quarter, Lukoil said.  In April, Lukoil spent $2.05 billion to buy Russian oil
producer Samara Nafta and $400 million for 49.99 percent of
Kama-Oil to raise its stake to almost 100 percent, as it bids to
ensure growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
