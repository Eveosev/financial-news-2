Spanish 10-year  government bonds  rose
for a second day as global stocks advanced, underpinning
investor demand for higher-yielding assets.  Germany ’s 10-year bund rates climbed to 1.50 percent for
the first time in almost 11 weeks after European Central Bank
Governing Council member  Christian Noyer  said he’s not convinced
about negative deposit rates. Italy sold 2.5 billion euros
($3.23 billion) of zero-coupon notes maturing in 2014 at a
record-low yield. Dutch 10-year government bond yields climbed
to the  highest  level in two months as the Netherlands auctioned
2.32 billion euros of the securities at a debt sale.  “The rise in Spanish bonds fits into the hunt-for-yield
environment,” said Rainer Guntermann, a rates strategist at
Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt . “The yield-spread compression
between peripherals and bunds should continue. Funding progress
looks a little more favorable for Italy than  Spain .”  Spain’s 10-year bond yields dropped four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 4.29 percent at 4:56 p.m. London time.
The 5.4 percent bond maturing in January 2023 rose 0.32, or 3.20
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 108.585.  The yield difference, or spread, between Spanish 10-year
 yields (GDBR10)  and their German equivalents narrowed eight basis points
to 280 basis points.  Non-resident holdings of Spanish bonds rose to 38.4 percent
in April from 37.2 percent in March, according to a report on
the Treasury’s website today. Domestic banks’ holdings declined
to 30.6 percent from 32.9 percent.  Italian Auctions  The European Commission will decide tomorrow whether to
grant Spain until 2016 to bring its deficit back within the
European Union limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product. Its
verdict is due as data this week including mortgage lending,
gross domestic product and inflation may underline that the
construction slump that triggered the nation’s economic crisis
in 2008 is far from over.  Italy  sold zero-coupon notes maturing in December 2014 at a
 record-low  yield of 1.113 percent, down from 1.167 percent at
the previous auction on April 24. Investors bid for 1.57 times
the amount allotted, compared with 1.66 times last month.  The Rome-based Treasury also sold 987 million euros of
inflation-linked bonds due in 2018 at 1.83 percent.  Italy’s 10-year bond yield dropped one basis point to 4.04
percent.  Yields on benchmark German 10-year bunds rose four basis
points to 1.50 percent after touching 1.51 percent, the most
since March 12. The Stoxx Europe 600  Index (SPX)  of shares rose for a
second day, gaining 1.3 percent, while the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index gained 0.9 percent.  Further Cuts  The ECB cut its benchmark  interest rate  to a record-low 0.5
percent on May 2 and President  Mario Draghi  signaled the central
bank is ready to lower it further if needed. Noyer said a
negative deposit rate -- which would mean lenders would pay to
park excess cash overnight with the ECB -- might prompt
institutions to raise their lending rates to offset that cost.  “There have been experiences in the past” and “not all
are convincing,” Noyer said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television in Paris today. “In some cases it even tended to
trigger an increase in the rates of credit because the banks
were compensating for a loss they were getting on their deposits
with the central bank.”  Spain’s government bonds handed investors a loss of 1.1
percent this month through yesterday, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies. German securities dropped 1.2 percent and
Italian bonds declined 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
