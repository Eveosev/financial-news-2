     May 28 (Bloomberg) -- Treasuries fell, pushing 10-year note
yields to the highest since April 2012, as the U.S. sale of $35
billion in two-year debt attracted the fewest bids for the
securities since February 2011.  The bid-to-cover  ratio , which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 3.04,
compared with an average of 3.72 for the past 10 sales. The
benchmark 10-year note yield rose the most in 19 months as a
report showed  consumer confidence  in May reached the strongest
in more than five years while Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said last week the central bank could cut the pace of
asset purchases if officials see indications of sustained
improvement in economic growth.  “It was a disappointing auction,” said Aaron Kohli, an
interest-rate strategist at BNP Paribas SA in New York, one of
21 primary dealers that are obligated to bid at U.S. government
debt offerings. “Everyone’s scared of catching a falling
knife.”  Benchmark 10-year  yields  climbed 16 basis points, or 0.16
percentage point, to 2.17 percent at 5:03 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The 1.75 percent note
due May 2023 slid 1 3/8, or $13.75 per $1,000 face amount, to 96
9/32. The decline was the biggest since October 2011 and the
yield reached the highest level since April 6, 2012.  Thirty-year bonds fell more than two points, with the yield
rising 15 basis points to 3.32 percent, touching the most since
April 2012.  Note Auction  The two-year notes drew a yield of 0.283 percent, compared
with a forecast of 0.277 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of
seven of the Fed’s 21 primary dealers. The  yield  on the current
two-year note rose four basis points to 0.29 percent.  Non-primary dealers bought the  fewest  of the $35 billion
two-year notes since April 2009, with indirect bidders, an
investor class that includes foreign central banks, purchasing
21.9 percent of the notes, and direct bidders buying 12.6
percent, the least since July.  Indirect bidders have averaged  winning  24.7 percent for the
past 10 sales while  direct  bidders have won an average 24.5
percent of the last 10 offerings. Primary dealers were awarded
65.5 percent of the offering.  “They got more than they expected, and that’s usually a
bad sign for price action following the auction,” Kohli said.  Debt Returns  Two-year notes have gained 0.1 percent this year, compared
with a decline of 0.5 percent by Treasuries overall, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The two-year
securities returned 0.3 percent in 2012, while Treasuries
overall rose 2.2 percent.  Today’s offering is the first of three note auctions this
week totaling $99 billion. The government will sell $35 billion
in five-year debt tomorrow and $29 billion in seven-year
securities on May 30.  The sales, including the Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities offering last week, will raise $53.54 billion of new
cash, as maturing securities held by the public total $58.46
billion, according to the  U.S. Treasury .  “There’s a fear there’s going to be a convexity-related
event and some of this is selling beforehand,” said Ira Jersey,
an interest-rate strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in New
York, a primary dealer.  Any convexity selling will be muted because of changes in
the composition of the mortgage market since the depths of the
financial crisis in 2008, Jersey said. The Fed now holds $1.17
trillion of  mortgage-backed  debt, which it doesn’t hedge, and
the portfolios of  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac  have shrunk,
limiting their need to minimize a rise in the interest-rate risk
of mortgages by selling Treasuries, Jersey said.  Technical Analysis  Should the 10-year Treasury yield close above 2.086
percent, the high for 2013, it would signal further increases,
said  David Ader , head of U.S. government-bond strategy at CRT
Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  “We get back over that and we have to talk about the highs
of last year,” Ader said.  The 10-year yield peaked in 2012 at 2.40 percent on March
20. From there it fell to a record low of 1.379 percent on July
25 as the European sovereign-debt crisis continued to worsen.  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage debt
a month, a policy known as quantitative easing, to support the
economy by putting downward pressure on borrowing costs. The
central bank acquired $1.45 billion of Treasuries maturing from
February 2036 to May 2043 today.  Bernanke’s View  “If we see continued improvement and we have confidence
that that is going to be sustained, then we could in -- in the
next few meetings -- we could take a step down in our pace of
purchases,” Bernanke told lawmakers last week. “Again, if we
do that, it would not mean that we are automatically aiming
toward -- toward a complete winddown. Rather, we would be
looking to beyond that to see how the economy evolves, and we
could either raise or lower our pace of purchases going
forward.”  The Conference Board’s confidence index rose to 76.2, the
strongest since February 2008 and exceeding the highest estimate
in a Bloomberg survey of economists, from a revised 69 in April,
data from the New York-based private research group showed
today. The median forecast called for an increase to 71.2.  The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values increased
10.9 percent from March 2012, the biggest 12-month gain since
April 2006, after advancing 9.4 percent in February, a report
showed today in  New York . The median projection of 30 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 10.2 percent advance.  Key Levels  “The fact that we broke through 2.085 percent level, which
was the high for the year, that brought in a lot of stop-outs
and fast-money selling for technical reasons as we pushed
through that,” said Jason Rogan, director of U.S. government
trading at Guggenheim Partners LLC, a New York-based brokerage
for institutional investors, referring to the 10-year yield.  Unemployment at 7.5 percent and a 1.1 percent inflation
rate are helping keep yields and volatility in check.  Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities show investors
anticipate an average increase of 2.28 percent in consumer
prices for the next decade, up from 2.23 percent on May 23,
which was the least since Aug. 9.  The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the personal
consumption expenditures deflator, fell in April for a second
month by 0.2 percent, according to the median forecast of 32
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The  Bureau of Economic
Analysis  will report the data May 31.  To contact the reporters on this story:
