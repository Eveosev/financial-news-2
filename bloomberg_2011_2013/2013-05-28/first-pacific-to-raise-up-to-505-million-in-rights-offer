First Pacific Co. (142) , controlled by
billionaire Anthoni Salim, fell to the lowest level in three
weeks in  Hong Kong  trading after a plan to offer as much as
HK$3.9 billion ($502 million) of rights shares.  The company, whose  businesses  include telecommunications,
infrastructure and food products, dropped 3 percent to HK$11.16
as of 10:01 a.m., poised for the lowest closing price since May
7. First Pacific said it will offer existing investors the right
to buy one new share at HK$8.10 for every eight held. That’s 30
percent cheaper than the closing price yesterday.  Funds raised will be used to strengthen the company’s
balance sheet, to finance acquisitions and for general corporate
purposes, First Pacific said yesterday. The Hong Kong-based
company plans to invest in infrastructure in Vietnam, Thailand
and Myanmar, Chief Executive Officer  Manuel Pangilinan  said in a
Bloomberg Television interview in March.  First Pacific said its controlling stakeholder has
committed to subscribe for 213.4 million of the maximum 491
million rights shares it plans to offer.  The company had net  debt  of $2.1 billion as of December,
compared with $1.8 billion a year earlier, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It had $2.2 billion in cash and near-cash
items at the end of last year, rising from $1.9 billion in 2011,
the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
