Mike Budenholzer was selected as the
coach of the  Atlanta Hawks  after 17 seasons as an assistant with
the  San Antonio Spurs .  With Larry Drew not being brought back by the Hawks,
Budenholzer will join the team as its 12th coach at the
conclusion of the National Basketball Association finals, the
Hawks said today in a news release. San Antonio swept the
Western Conference finals and awaits a championship matchup with
either the Miami Heat or  Indiana Pacers .  The Spurs have won four NBA titles since Budenholzer became
an assistant for the 1996-97 season, posting a league-best
908-438 regular-season record in that time.  “He has an incredible basketball acumen and has a keen
awareness of the league and what it takes to be successful,”
Hawks General Manager Danny Ferry said in a statement. “His
experience and four championships over the last 17 years provide
a tremendous foundation for his leadership of our team.”  Budenholzer, 43, was a video coordinator for the Spurs for
two seasons before becoming an assistant. He’s a 1993 graduate
of Pomona College in Claremont, California, where he played
basketball and golf.  The Hawks went 44-38 during the regular season, falling in
six games to the Pacers in the first round of the playoffs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
