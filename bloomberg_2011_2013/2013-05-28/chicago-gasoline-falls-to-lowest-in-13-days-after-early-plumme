Gasoline on the  spot market  in
Chicago fell to the lowest premium to the U.S. benchmark in 13
days after paring a steeper decline in earlier trading.  Conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB, in Chicago, fell
7 cents to 26 cents a gallon above futures on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange at 4:11 p.m. New York time, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The fuel had dropped to a  premium  of
18 cents.  “Somebody showed themselves as a buyer,” said Jim Mosby,
supply manager at ADMO Energy LLC, a supply consultant in  Kansas
City , Missouri. “That’s how Chicago moves. There are so few
players, everyone gets wind of a refinery having trouble, and
they bend them over. Everyone else moves by half-cents, Chicago
moves by nickels and dimes.”  Chicago gasoline reached 37 cents a gallon above futures on
May 14, the highest level since Aug. 30, as refinery maintenance
limited production and inventories were depleted.  Calumet Specialty Products Partners LP (CLMT)  restarted its
45,000-barrel-a-day Superior refinery in Wisconsin after
shutting it in April, refinery manager David Podratz said today
by phone.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Group 3, which includes
regions north of Tulsa, Oklahoma, to Minnesota and  North Dakota ,
weakened by 4.5 cents to 13 cents a gallon above futures. Prices
there have receded from a record premium of 64 cents a gallon on
May 16.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel in Chicago weakened by 2.5 cents to
12.5 cents a gallon above diesel futures on the Nymex. The fuel
in Group 3 weakened by 0.25 cent to 6.88 cents a gallon above
futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
