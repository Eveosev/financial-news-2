Hire rates for the largest  oil
tankers  rose as a  surplus  of the vessels declined to the
smallest in six-months in the  Persian Gulf , the world’s biggest
crude-loading region.  There are 12 percent more very large crude carriers
available over the next 30 days than probable cargoes, according
to the median in a Bloomberg News survey of four shipbrokers and
two owners today. That’s down from 19 percent last week and the
smallest excess since Nov. 27. Each of the tankers can hold 2
million barrels of oil.  Charter costs for VLCCs hauling Middle East crude may rise
to 45 Worldscale points by the end of today, Odysseas Valatsas,
chartering manager Dynacom Tankers Management Ltd., an Athens-based operator of the vessels, said by e-mail today. Rates
gained 2.4 percent to 39.25 points last week, according to the
 Baltic Exchange , a London-based publisher of shipping prices for
commodities.  “Rates could move higher if activity is maintained,”
Oslo-based investment bank RS Platou Markets AS said in an e-mailed report yesterday.  VLCCs were earning $11,861 daily as of May 24 on the
industry’s benchmark Saudi Arabia-to-Japan voyage, according to
the exchange. Its earnings assessments don’t take account of
speed cuts aimed at boosting returns by lowering fuel usage.  The VLCC fleet’s carrying capacity will expand 5.1 percent
this year, near demand growth of 5 percent, according to
 Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the world’s largest shipbroker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
