Electrabel SA, the Belgian unit of
 GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA, is concerned about its 2013 results after posting a
105.7 million-euro ($137 million) loss last year, L’Echo
reported.  “Our year-end loss remains a major concern for us and our
shareholders,” Electrabel Chief Financial Officer Valery
Perrier told the Brussels-based newspaper in an interview
published today.  Perrier said the 2012 loss resulted from the temporary
shutdown of the Tihange-2 and Doel-3 nuclear reactors, Belgium’s
nuclear tax, “which more than doubled in 2012,” and loss of
customers, L’Echo reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
