Brazil ’s shorter-term swap rates
declined on speculation the central bank will avoid stepping up
increases in borrowing costs as the board begins a two-day
monetary policy meeting today.  Swap rates on the contract due in January dropped one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.14 percent at 10:05 a.m.
in Sao Paulo. The real appreciated 0.1 percent to 2.0552 per
U.S. dollar after declining yesterday to 2.0571, the weakest
closing level since Dec. 24.  Policy makers raised the target lending rate last month by
a quarter-percentage point to 7.50 percent. Inflation has
remained above the 4.5 percent midpoint of their preferred range
since central bank President Alexandre Tombini took office in
January 2011.  “Apparently, there is an increase in bets that the central
bank will maintain the pace of increases at 25 basis points,”
 Jankiel Santos , the chief economist at Banco Espirito Santo de
Investimento in Sao Paulo, said in a phone interview.  The nation’s $2.5 trillion economy will expand 2.93 percent
this year, down from last week’s median forecast of 2.98
percent, according to the central bank’s survey of about 100
analysts published yesterday. That compares with the monetary
authority’s forecast of 3.1 percent growth.  To contact the reporters on this story:
