Computer hacker Jeremy Hammond
pleaded guilty to an attack on the intelligence firm Strategic
Forecasting Inc. and admitted interfering with eight other
computer systems.  Hammond, 28, pleaded guilty to a single count of conspiracy
at a hearing in  Manhattan  federal court. Under an agreement with
prosecutors, Hammond may be sentenced to as long as 10 years in
prison.  Hammond told U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska that he was
part of a group that in December 2011 ransacked computer files
of Austin, Texas-based Strategic Forecasting, or Stratfor.
Closely held Stratfor provides geopolitical analysis and
intelligence to governments and businesses.  Hammond, who prosecutors said was a member of the hacking
group called AntiSec, also admitted hacking into eight other
computers, including those used by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation’s Virtual Academy and the  Arizona  Department of
Public Safety, from June 2011 to February 2012.  Under the plea agreement with prosecutors, Hammond
acknowledged his hacking caused losses between $1 million and
$2.5 million and involved more than 250 victims.  Both sides said federal sentencing guidelines would call
for Hammond to get as much as 15 years and eight months in
prison. When he’s sentenced Sept. 6, he’ll be sentenced to no
more than 10 years, the statutory maximum for his crime, Preska
said.  The case is U.S. v. Hammond, 12-cr-185, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
