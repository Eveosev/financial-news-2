Japanese  stocks  gained, led by
carmakers as the yen slid after  Bank of Japan  board member Ryuzo
Miyao said the bank’s policy of expanding the monetary base
helps weaken the currency.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , which gets 73 percent of its sales
abroad, rose 6.5 percent as the yen slid against all its major
peers. Mitsubishi Motors Corp. surged 14 percent to lead gains
on the Nikkei 225 Stock Average after losing about 25 percent in
the previous four days.  Tokyo  Electric Power Co. fell 6 percent
after  Kyodo News  said a parliamentary committee approved a bill
allowing people affected by the Fukushima nuclear disaster to
seek compensation beyond a three-year claims limit.  The  Topix (TPX)  added 1.2 percent to close at 1,168.27 in Tokyo
after falling as much as 1.2 percent. Even after a 9.6 percent
drop in the previous three days, Japan’s broadest equities gauge
is still up 36 percent this year. The  Nikkei 225  gained 1.2
percent to 14,311.98 today.  “The yen’s decline triggered a rebound from the sharp
slide that started at the end of last week,” said Ichiro Yamada,  helps manage about $3 billion in stocks at Fukoku
Mutual Life Insurance Co. in Tokyo. “When you think about how
much stocks slumped, the rebound has been a little anemic, but
the market has stabilized somewhat.”  The Topix plunged 6.9 percent on May 23, the most since the
aftermath of March 2011’s natural and nuclear disasters, and
yesterday closed within half a percentage point from a
correction, defined as a 10 percent drop from a recent high. The
measure on May 22 closed at the highest level since Aug. 11,
2008, amid unprecedented BOJ bond buying.  BOJ Miyao  Japan’s economy has started picking up, BOJ board member
Miyao said today in Tokyo. The central bank will monitor the
 bond market  carefully after yields on benchmark 10-year notes
touched 1 percent last week for the first time in a year.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index dropped 3.9
percent to 37.08, indicating traders expect a swing of about 11
percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  Carmakers rose the most among the 33 Topix industry groups
today as the yen slid against all of its 16 major counterparts.
A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas earnings at Japanese
exporters.  Mazda advanced 6.5 percent to 428 yen. Mitsubishi Motors
surged 14 percent to 168 yen. Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s
biggest carmaker, rose 4.9 percent to 6,210 yen.  Toyota Compensation  Toyota plans to pay 1.1 billion yen in compensation and 428
million yen in bonuses to directors as well as audit and
supervisory board members, for the year ended March 2013, the
company said in a notice sent to shareholders. The total is 28
percent higher than a year earlier.  U.S. markets reopen today after a holiday. The Conference
Board’s index of consumer sentiment probably climbed this month
to its highest level since November, while the S&P/Case-Shiller
index of property values in 20 U.S. cities jumped the most since
April 2006, data today is expected to show.  Tokyo Electric Power lost 6 percent to 612 yen after
falling 7.3 percent yesterday. Kyodo said  Japan ’s upper house
committee approved a bill to allow those affected by the
Fukushima disaster to seek compensation payments even after the
