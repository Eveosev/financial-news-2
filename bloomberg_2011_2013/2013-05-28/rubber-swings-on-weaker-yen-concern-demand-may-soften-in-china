Rubber futures swung between gains
and losses as investors weighed weakness in the yen, which
boosts the appeal of contracts in the Japanese currency, against
concern that demand may slow in  China .  The contract for delivery in October was little changed at
265.7 yen a kilogram ($2,609 a metric ton) at 11:24 a.m. in
Tokyo after trading between 264.5 yen and 269.5 yen on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange. Futures for November delivery, listed on the
bourse today, traded at 268 yen after opening at 267.7 yen.  The yen snapped a three-day advance, weakening as much as 1
percent against the dollar before U.S. data today forecast to
show  consumer confidence  improved and  home prices  rose. A report
showed last week that China’s manufacturing was contracting in
May for the first time in seven months, raising concern that
demand will weaken in the biggest consumer of rubber.  “Rubber has followed the yen’s movements over the past
days, while the prospect of slowing demand in China weighed down
the market,” said  Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at broker Fujitomi
Co. in Tokyo.  Rubber for delivery in September on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell 0.2 percent to 19,075  yuan  ($3,114) a ton.  Thai rubber free-on-board dropped 0.6 percent to 90.65 baht
($3.03) a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
