American International Group Inc. (AIG)  and
MetLife Inc. are among insurers asked by a New York regulator to
show how they protect against computer attacks.  Insurers received letters requesting information on whether
they have been targeted by hackers and how the companies
safeguard customer information, the New York State Department of
Financial Services said today in a statement. The regulator sent
a similar request to banks this year.  “The extraordinarily sensitive health, personal and
financial information that New Yorkers entrust to their
insurance companies is a virtual treasure trove for hackers,”
Governor Andrew Cuomo said in the statement.  DFS Superintendent  Benjamin Lawsky  said cybersecurity at
insurers “often gets overlooked.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
