Total SA (FP) , France’s largest oil
producer, is selling a stake in an exploration block off  Angola 
to state petroleum company Sonangol Pesquisa e Producao SA as
part of an asset-disposal program.  Total will sell a 15 percent holding in the 15-06 zone
operated by  Eni SpA (ENI) , according to a decree allowing the sale
issued on Feb. 28 and seen by Bloomberg this week. While the
block isn’t producing, the development of discoveries located in
its northwest began early last year.  “Talks are ongoing,” Total spokeswoman Anastasia Zhivulina said by phone in Paris. She declined to give a price.  Total plans to complete $15 billion to $20 billion of asset
disposals from 2012 to 2014. The company concluded the sale of a
10 percent interest in Angola’s Block 14 in the first quarter to
 Japan ’s  Inpex Corp. (1605)  China Petrochemical Corp. bought Total’s 20
percent stake in OML 38 off  Nigeria  in November for about $2.5
billion.  There was no immediate reply to an e-mail late yesterday
seeking comment from Sonangol spokeswoman Nadiejda Santos.  Sonangol, which already has a 15 percent stake in the area
120 kilometers (75 miles) offshore in 1,000 meters of water, has
the first option to buy a block partner’s share should it decide
to sell. Eni and Sonangol Sinopec International Angola Lda. each
hold 25 percent. Norway’s  Statoil ASA (STL)  and closely-held Falcon
Oil Holding SA Angola control 5 percent each.  Angola probably produced about 1.8 million barrels a day in
April, second in  Africa  to Nigeria, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Largest Producer  Total is the largest crude producer in Angola. Block 17
where it has a 40 percent share, pumped 468,000 barrels a day in
March, according to the  Finance Ministry . The assembly of a
floating production, storage and offloading vessel for the CLOV
project in that zone is expected to start by the end of the
year. It will be the first FPSO to be outfitted in Angola and
the project is expected to produce 160,000 barrels a day after
it starts next year, according to company documents.  A final  investment decision  is planned this year on the
Kaombo project in Block 32. The Lianzi project in a zone between
Angola and the Republic of Congo will be developed with a link
to the Benguela-Belize-Lobito-Tomboco platform in Block 14, the
 company said . Production is expected to start in 2015 and Total
has a 27 percent share.  Total is operator on exploration blocks 33, 17-06, 25 and
40, and has a stake in 39. It plans to drill for oil under a
layer of salt below the seafloor next year in 25, 39, and 40.
The Angola Liquid Natural Gas project, in which Total has a 14
percent share, is expected to start next month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
