EU Tax Commissioner Algirdas Semeta
said some European Union nations have made it too easy for
companies to avoid taxes by shifting income to countries outside
the 27-nation bloc.  “Some member states have fairly loose or relatively
liberal double-taxation agreements with third countries,”
Semeta said in a Brussels speech today to the Friends of Europe
group. “These very loose agreements actually allow aggressive
tax planners to shift their profits through EU member states to
third countries and to avoid taxation in general.”  Semeta said he’s not calling for an end to tax competition
among EU members. At the same time, he said countries should not
create “specific incentives to foreign companies or wealthy
individuals” who want to escape taxes.  Ireland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and  Austria  are EU
nations that have been criticized for their policies by
campaigners amid a new wave of concern over “aggressive” tax
planning. Apple Inc. has recently drawn the ire of U.S.
politicians concerned it is avoiding too many taxes by shifting
income to an Irish affiliate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
