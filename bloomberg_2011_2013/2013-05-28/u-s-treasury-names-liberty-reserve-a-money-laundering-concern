The U.S. Treasury Department today
named Liberty Reserve SA a financial institution of primary
money-laundering concern, in what the department called the
first use of certain authorities in the Patriot Act against a
virtual currency provider.  “Liberty Reserve’s virtual currency has become a preferred
method of payment on websites dedicated to the promotion and
facilitation of illicit web-based activity, including identity
fraud, credit-card theft, online scams and dissemination of
computer malware,” according to the department’s statement
released in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
