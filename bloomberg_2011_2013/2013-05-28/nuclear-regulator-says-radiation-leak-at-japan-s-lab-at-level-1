Japan ’s nuclear watchdog said it
tentatively ranked a radiation leak at the Japan Atomic Energy
Agency’s laboratory last week at the second lowest level of 1 on
the international scale for nuclear accident severity.  The leak caused a “slight increase” in radiation levels
outside the site, and there would be “no impact on the general
public,” the Nuclear Regulation Authority  said  in a statement
yesterday. Japan Atomic failed to properly manage the leak and
used ventilation fans to emit radiation into the air even though
it confirmed contamination inside the facility, the regulator
said.  The nuclear physics laboratory in Ibaraki prefecture was
shut after the leak on May 23, which caused at least 30 people
in the building to be exposed to radiation, the NRA said. The
highest dose among the people was 1.7 millisieverts, less than
the annual regulatory limit of 50 millisieverts for nuclear
workers in Japan, the regulator said.  Japan’s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, the now-defunct nuclear watchdog, rated the Fukushima disaster at the
highest level 7, the same as the 1986 Chernobyl accident, a
month after the quake and tsunami in March 2011 caused meltdowns
and radiation leaks at Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s atomic
station. Initially, the Fukushima accident was given a rating of
5 on the international rating, the same as the 1979 partial
meltdown at Three Mile Island in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
