Australand Property Group (ALZ) , the
Australian real estate trust  controlled by  Singapore’s
 CapitaLand Ltd. (CAPL) , fell after  GPT (GPT)  Group withdrew an offer for its
commercial property business.  Australand  shares  dropped 0.9 percent to A$3.50 at the
close of trading in Sydney, after earlier falling as much as 6.2
percent. GPT shares reversed an earlier 1.6 percent decline to
end the day up 0.1 percent at A$3.97.  GPT,  Australia ’s second-biggest diversified property trust
by market capitalization, yesterday said it was abandoning its
pursuit of Australand’s commercial property and development
businesses because a transaction at the price it was willing to
pay wasn’t possible. Australand in December rejected GPT’s
offer, which would have left the target with only the
residential development business, saying it didn’t offer a
“compelling” value proposition.  “We see this as a sensible decision from GPT’s
perspective,” analysts led by  Richard Jones  at JPMorgan Chase &
Co. wrote in a client note today. “GPT wouldn’t bid for
Australand’s residential business and the Australand board
wasn’t prepared to negotiate for just parts of the Australand
business at a price which could allow it to execute the deal and
maintain acceptable returns from the transaction.”  Australand yesterday confirmed it was unable to develop a
proposal with GPT that was “compelling” for its shareholders.  “Australand advises that, while it is not in receipt of
any other formal proposals, the process has not reached a
conclusion and it will update the market once the process has
been completed,” it said.  CapitaLand Stake  CapitaLand, which owns 59 percent of Australand, said in
January it would consider exiting its investment in the Sydney-based company. Yesterday’s announcement isn’t expected to have
any “material impact” on CapitaLand’s net tangible assets or
earnings per share, the company said in a separate statement.  “We expect CapitaLand to offer part or all of its 59
percent holding in Australand in a secondary offering, which
would attractively increase its liquidity,” John Kim, head of
real estate research at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, said in an e-mailed note today.  Australand’s office and industrial investment properties
were valued at A$2.3 billion ($2.2 billion) as of Dec. 31,
according to the company. The company’s planned commercial
development projects, included in GPT’s bid, had an end value of
A$2.1 billion, and its planned residential developments, which
weren’t included in GPT’s bid, will be worth a total A$8 billion
on completion.  GPT “doesn’t need to proceed with the transaction to
achieve its strategic goals,” GPT said yesterday.  Australand shares have risen 2.9 percent this year,
 compared with  a 7.9 percent increase in GPT’s stock and a 6.9
percent gain in the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
