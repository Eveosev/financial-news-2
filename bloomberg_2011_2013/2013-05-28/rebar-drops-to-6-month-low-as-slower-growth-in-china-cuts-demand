Steel reinforcement-bar futures fell
for a second day to the lowest level in six months after Chinese
Premier Li Keqiang said policy makers may maintain slower
economic growth, reducing demand.  Rebar for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange, fell as much as 0.5 percent to 3,479  yuan  ($568) a
metric ton, the lowest level for a most-active contract since
Nov. 30, and was at 3,486 yuan at 10:46 a.m. local time.  Li said from Berlin his country faces “huge challenges”
as it opens up the economy and that the new government’s reform
measures will be accompanied by tapered-off levels of growth.  “The prospect of a weakening macro economy will keep a lid
on any rebound in steel demand,” Dang Man, an analyst at Maike
Futures Co., said from Xi’an.  Ore with 62 percent iron content delivered to Tianjin port
fell 1.9 percent to $120.90 a dry ton yesterday, according to
The Steel Index Ltd. data. The average  spot price  for rebar fell
0.2 percent to 3,530 yuan, the lowest since September, according
to data from Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
