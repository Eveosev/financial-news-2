Social entrepreneurs suffer from lack of funding. Donations and grants don't allow them to innovate and grow. They have virtually no access to capital markets and little flexibility to experiment at various stages of growth. But the problem is not money, per se. There are $700 billion of foundation assets, and 10 million people working for nonprofits in the U.S. So why are we still facing intractable problems?  In this interactive HBR webinar,  Sir Ronald Cohen  discusses impact investment and where it stands today as well as the latest innovations in funding entrepreneurial solutions to societal problems.
