Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  intends to remain in his job until at least 2015, a
spokesman said, denying the minister may seek to retire before a
summer cabinet shuffle.  Flaherty doesn’t plan to step down before he balances the
federal books, Dan Miles, the minister’s director of
communications, said by phone from Ottawa today. Flaherty’s
March budget projected Canada will swing to a surplus of about
C$800 million ($770 million) in the fiscal year beginning April
2015, from an C$18.7 billion deficit in the current year.  “He has every intention of staying,” Miles said of
Flaherty, the longest-serving finance minister among the Group
of Seven countries.  Flaherty revealed earlier this year that he’s suffering
from a rare skin disease, which prompted newspaper articles that
speculated he may be removed as finance minister when Prime
Minister Stephen Harper makes changes to his cabinet during the
legislature’s summer recess, which begins next month.  “The prime minister has commented publicly on his plans
for a mid-mandate shuffle,” said Andrew MacDougall, a spokesman
for Harper, by e-mail. “I won’t speculate on the outcomes.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
