Dong Energy A/S, Denmark’s largest
utility, postponed switching a power station unit to burn
biomass instead of coal, citing rules on the tax it will have to
pay for producing heat from the renewable fuel.  The project faces a delay of one year while Dong waits for
the Danish government to set the fees, outlined as part of a
national energy plan agreed in March last year, Carsten
Birkeland Kjaer, a company spokesman, said today by e-mail.  Dong plans to invest about 500 million pounds ($753
million) to convert three of its coal- and gas-fired power
stations to generate heat and electricity from wood pellets, the
Fredericia-based company said in April 2012. The government’s
energy strategy includes plans to get more than 35 percent of
energy from renewables by 2020 and names biomass as an important
coal replacement.  “This legal framework is very relevant for our business
case and thus we cannot make a final  investment decision  without
knowing the wording,” Kjaer said.  Dong hopes the framework will be in place by the end of the
year, allowing the company to complete the conversion later in
2016, a one-year delay, he said. A 375-megawatt unit at the
Studstrup power station near Aarhus is to be converted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
