Ethanol strengthened against gasoline
on concern that bad weather in the Midwest will slow corn
planting and raise production costs to make the biofuel.  The spread, or price difference, narrowed 1.42 cents to
22.08 cents a gallon on speculation that wet weather in the
corn-rich Midwest kept farmers from putting equipment in soggy
fields to plant that grain and primary feedstock for ethanol in
the U.S. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of the fuel.  “It’s getting some outside support from corn,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa .
“There’s some concern out there. That’s helping to support
things.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery climbed 2.8 cents, or
1.1 percent, to $2.632 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have gained 26 percent in the past year.  Gasoline for June delivery rose 1.38 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to $2.8528 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The
contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with
ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Corn for July delivery jumped 9.25 cents, or 1.4 percent,
to $6.665 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of the fuel.  The corn crush spread, or the cost difference between a
gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, was about 8
cents, unchanged from May 24 and down from 12 cents on May 22,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The amount doesn’t include
revenue from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct
of ethanol production, which can be fed to livestock.  Production Rising  Ethanol  production  in the week ended May 17 increased 2.1
percent to 875,000 barrels a day, the most since June 22, data
from the Energy Information Administration show. That’s down 9.1
percent from the record 963,000 barrels a day in December 2011,
data from the Energy Department’s analytical arm show.  Declining output has led to record-low stockpiles for this
time of year. Inventories were at 16.2 million barrels in the
week ended May 17, the Energy Department’s analytical arm said
in a May 22 report, the lowest level since Nov. 5, 2010.  Corn-based ethanol RINs for 2013  fell 0.5 cent to 85 cents
at 4:13 p.m.  New York  time. Advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel
and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, fell 0.5 cent to 94.5
cents.  Blackford said ethanol prices may be boosted as
backwardation, a phenomena where prompt prices are higher than
later ones, dissuades Brazilian exporters from shipping the
biofuel to the U.S. The U.S. hasn’t  imported  any of the fuel
since April 19, according to EIA data.  Cash Market  Anhydrous ethanol in  Sao Paulo  fetched $2.53 a gallon as of
May 17, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  In the U.S., ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 94
percent of the total U.S. gasoline pool, the lowest since April
19, according to EIA data.  In cash market trading, ethanol rose 1 cent to $2.73 a
gallon in New York, 2 cents to $2.64 in  Chicago , 3 cents to
$2.77 on the  Gulf Coast  and 2 cents to $2.835 on the West Coast,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the U.S. Gulf narrowed 1
cent to 6.5 cents. Chicago’s discount to New York narrowed 1
cent to 9 cents, the tightest since April 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
