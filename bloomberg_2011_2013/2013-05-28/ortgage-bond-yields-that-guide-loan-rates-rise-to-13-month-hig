Yields on  Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac
mortgage bonds that guide U.S. home-loan rates rose to the
highest in 13 months as reports stoke optimism that the economic
outlook may be improving.  Fannie Mae’s current-coupon 30-year securities climbed 0.09
percentage point to 2.91 percent as of 12:27 p.m. in New York,
the highest level since April 2012, according to  data  compiled
by Bloomberg. The yields have risen from a record-low of 1.68
percent reached Sept. 26, after the  Federal Reserve  announced it
would start buying $40 billion of government-backed housing debt
a month, embarking on its third round of so-called quantitative
easing to spur growth.  Yields on mortgage-bonds are rising after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told lawmakers last week that the pace of purchases
could be reduced in the “next few meetings,” if the labor
market improves, sparking concern that values of the debt will
fall as the central bank pulls back from the market.  Speculation that the Fed will slow its bond buying is being
fueled by positive readings on U.S. housing and  consumer
confidence . The Conference Board’s  index  of consumer sentiment
climbed more than forecast to 76.2 in May, the highest level in
more than five years, data from the New York-based private
research group showed today. The S&P/Case-Shiller  index  of
property values in 20 cities increased 10.9 percent in the year
ended March, the biggest 12-month gain since April 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
