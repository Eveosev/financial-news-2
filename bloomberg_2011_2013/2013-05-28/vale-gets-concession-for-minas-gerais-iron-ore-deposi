Vale SA, the world’s largest iron-ore
producer, won approval to exploit a deposit of the steelmaking
ingredient in the Brazilian state of  Minas Gerais  as it seeks to
replace dwindling production.  Vale, based in  Rio de Janeiro, received the concession to
work at a mine in the municipality of Mariana, according to a
statement in  Brazil ’s official gazette  today . The permit will
allow an estimated 20 million metric tons of iron-ore production
a year on reserves of 64.9 million tons, it said.  Vale is seeking to expand output as aging mines and
permitting delays in Brazil led to a market share loss to
Australian producers in the last five years. The company’s iron-ore production in the southeastern region where Mariana is
located declined 7.4 percent in the first quarter from a year
earlier, Vale said April 17.  The permit will allow Vale to explore new mine sections at
its Mariana iron-ore complex, the company’s press office said in
an e-mailed statement today. The licensing will resolve the
lower productivity registered at the mine in the first quarter,
it said.  Vale  dropped  1.6 percent to 29.77 reais at the close in  Sao
Paulo , extending its decline during 2013 to 27 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
