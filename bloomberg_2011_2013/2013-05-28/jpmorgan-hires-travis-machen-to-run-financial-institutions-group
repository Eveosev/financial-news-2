JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  hired Travis Machen from Morgan Stanley to run corporate banking for hedge
funds, money managers and other mid-sized financial firms.  Machen, 37, was co-head of Morgan Stanley’s North American
banks group in the investment-bank division, New York-based
JPMorgan said today in a statement. He’ll be in charge of
JPMorgan’s financial institutions group within its commercial
bank, which serves clients with $50 million to $25 billion in
assets, the company said.  Machen’s experience will be “essential to effectively
address the rapidly changing regulatory environment that
continues to affect this industry,” Rob Holmes, head of
JPMorgan corporate client banking, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
