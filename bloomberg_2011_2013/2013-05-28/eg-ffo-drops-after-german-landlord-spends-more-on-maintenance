LEG Immobilien AG (LEG) , Germany’s second-largest residential landlord by market value, said first-quarter
funds from operations fell 4.8 percent after the company spent
more on maintaining apartments.  FFO excluding asset sales, a measure of a property
company’s ability to generate cash, slid to 33.8 million euros
($44 million) from 35.5 million euros a year earlier, the
company said in a  statement  today.  “This decline is solely due to the temporary effect of
higher maintenance expenses,” the Dusseldorf-based company said
in the statement. Maintenance costs rose to 12.2 million euros
from 7.1 million euros a year earlier.  LEG was taken public by former owner Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. in February in the German property industry’s biggest
initial public offering. The country’s residential landlords are
benefiting from rising rents as household growth in  Germany 
outpaces construction.  Net income from LEG’s main business of renting apartments
rose 2.1 percent to 59.5 million euros, the company said. Rent
paid by existing tenants climbed 2.1 percent, to 4.91 euros per
square meter.  LEG was up 1.1 percent at 44.55 euros at the 5:30 p.m.
 close in Frankfurt , giving the company a market value of 2.4
billion euros. The IPO price on Feb. 1 was 44 euros a share.  Better Outlook  Group net income fell to 11 million euros from 14.8 million
euros a year earlier as costs increased. Net rental income rose
2 percent to 59.5 million euros.  The company repeated its forecast that 2013 FFO will rise
to between 137 million euros and 140 million euros, excluding
acquisitions. FFO in 2012 was 136.5 million euros. Maintenance
spending will fall during 2013, helping boost full-year
earnings, it said.  LEG is expected to join Germany’s MDAX index for medium-sized companies following a fast-track review of listings on
Wednesday, Manfred Jaisfeld, an analyst at National-Bank AG in
Essen, wrote yesterday.  LEG owns 91,000 apartments in North Rhine-Westphalia,
Germany’s most populous state. About 18 percent of LEG’s
apartments are in the Dusseldorf area, where the number of
households is increasing and rents rose 6 percent last year,
according to data compiled by research firm BulwienGesa AG.  The company plans to buy 10,000 apartments by the end of
2014. On May 16, LEG said it bought 2,200 apartments from a
group of investors led by BGP Investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
