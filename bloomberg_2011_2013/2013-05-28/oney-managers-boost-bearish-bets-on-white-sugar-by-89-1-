Money managers  boosted bets  on lower
prices of white sugar traded in London by 89 percent in the week
ended May 21 after turning bearish on the commodity a week
earlier, according to NYSE Liffe, the derivatives arm of NYSE
Euronext.  Net-short positions, or wagers on a lower market, totaled
7,713 futures and options in the period, the Commitments of
Traders report published on the exchange’s  website  today showed.
That compares with 4,073 contracts a week earlier and a net-long
position of 1,351 contracts in the prior seven-day period. Sugar
retreated 0.4 percent in the week.  The  premium  white sugar commands over the raw variety will
slide 15 percent by the end of next month as  Thailand , the
world’s second biggest exporter, and Mexico ship record amounts
of refined product. The price gap between the two varieties will
narrow to $91 a ton by the end of June, according to the mean of
eight trader estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  In robusta coffee, money managers boosted their  net-long 
position by 13 percent, exchange data showed. Net-long positions
rose to 5,308 futures and options from 4,684 contracts a week
earlier. The beans used to make instant coffee and espresso fell
2 percent in the period.  Money managers’  net-long position  in cocoa climbed to
42,896 contracts from 42,134 lots a week earlier, the data
showed. The beans rose 0.1 percent in the period.  In feed wheat, money managers reduced their net-short
position to 378 contracts from 396 a week earlier. The grain
tumbled 7.3 percent in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
