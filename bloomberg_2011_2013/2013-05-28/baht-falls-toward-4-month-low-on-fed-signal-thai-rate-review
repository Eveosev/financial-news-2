Thailand’s baht dropped toward a
four-month low before U.S. data forecast to show an improvement
in  consumer confidence  amid speculation the  Federal Reserve  will
reduce stimulus that’s boosted demand for emerging-market assets.  The currency was poised for a second monthly decline as the
Bank of Thailand prepares to meet tomorrow, with 13 of 22
economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicting a 25 basis point cut
in the one-day bond repurchase rate to 2.5 percent. Eight see no
change and one a half percentage point reduction. Fed Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said last week the central bank may slow the
pace of quantitative easing.  “The main theme is still concern the Fed will reduce
quantitative easing, which is causing dollar strength,” said
Disawat Tiaowvanich, a foreign-exchange trader at Bangkok Bank
Pcl. “Investors and traders have been pricing in a rate cut in
Thailand, but with the strong dollar trend, they don’t have to
bring a big cut.”  The baht dropped 0.2 percent to 29.92 per dollar as of 9:16
a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency, which fell 2 percent this month, touched 30.10 on May
23, the weakest level since Jan. 15.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against six
major counterparts, rose 0.2 percent to 83.865. It reached the
highest in almost three years on May 23. The Conference Board’s
index of consumer sentiment probably climbed to 71 in May, a
level last reached in November, according to the median estimate
in a Bloomberg survey.  Yield Forecasts  Bank of  Thailand  Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul said May
21 that monetary policy could be eased if the economy slows. The
National Economic and Social Development Board scaled back its
forecast for 2013 growth to as much as 5.2 percent on May 20
from 5.5 percent. Gross domestic product increased 5.3 percent
in the first quarter, compared with 19.1 percent in the previous
three months, official data showed May 20.  Still, the baht remains  Asia ’s best-performing currency
this year with a gain of 2.2 percent. It reached 28.56 on April
22 and April 19, the strongest level since July 1997.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.64 percent today.  Thai bonds will benefit from a cut in  interest rates ,  Tim Condon , head of Asian research at ING Groep NV, wrote in a
research note to clients today. He lowered his forecast for the
10-year yield to 3.3 percent from 3.8 percent.  The yield on the 3.625 percent debt due June 2023 rose one
basis point to 3.39 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
