ReNeuron Group Plc (RENE)  rose the most in
three months in London after the U.K. company released interim
data from a study that showed its stem-cell therapy helped
reduce impairment in nine stroke patients.  ReNeuron gained as much as 31 percent, the biggest increase
since Feb. 28. The  shares  were up 18 percent at 2.90 pence at
8:50 a.m. in London, giving the company a market value of 22.5
million pounds ($34 million). More than 4.4 million shares had
traded at that time, more than double the three-month daily
average.  In the trial, dubbed Pisces, of the ReN001 stem-cell
therapy, researchers found sustained reductions in neurological
impairment and spasticity, compared with the patients’ states
before treatment, Guildford, England-based ReNeuron said today
in a statement. There were no cell-related or immune-system
reactions reported in any of the patients, the company said.  The findings will be presented at the European Stroke
Conference in  London  this week, ReNeuron said. The company will
seek final regulatory and ethical approvals in early July for
the second of three phases of human testing usually needed for
marketing clearance.  ReNeuron began the safety trial more than two years ago
after obtaining permission from U.K. regulators. There aren’t
any treatments to reverse the disability caused by strokes,
which occur when there is a sudden loss of blood to the brain.
Every year, about 5 million people worldwide are disabled by
strokes, according to the  World Health Organization  in Geneva.  To contact the reporter on this story:
