The following is the text of
Canada’s financial statistics report for the first quarter
released by  Statistics Canada .  Canadian corporations earned $74.0 billion in operating
profits in the first quarter, down 1.2% from the previous
quarter. This followed a 1.4% increase in the fourth quarter of
2012.  Operating profits decreased in 14 of 22 industries. Leading
the overall decline were insurance carriers and related
activities, down 16.0% to $3.9 billion. Securities, commodity
contracts and other financial investments fell 4.2% to $5.5
billion.  In the non-financial sector, first quarter operating
profits rose 0.3% to $53.6 billion, following a 0.9% increase in
the previous quarter. Retail trade profits increased 1.7% to
$4.1 billion. Profits for manufacturing industries declined 1.0%
to $12.1 billion. Wholesale trade profits fell 3.0% to $5.7
billion.  In the financial sector, operating profits declined 4.7% to
$20.4 billion, following a 2.7% rise in the fourth quarter. Most
of the first quarter decline came from insurance carriers and
related activities.  On a year-over-year basis, operating profits for Canadian
corporations decreased 3.3% compared with the first quarter of
2012. Profits fell 2.8% in the non-financial sector and 4.5% in
the financial sector.  Non-financial sector  Operating profit growth in oil and gas extraction recovered
with a 28.3% rise to $1.7 billion in the first quarter, after
posting six consecutive quarterly declines.  Profits in transportation and warehousing rose 5.4% to $3.7
billion.  Operating profits in manufacturing fell 1.0% to $12.1
billion.  Of 13 manufacturing industries, 8 reported decreases. Air,
rail and ship products and other transportation equipment
profits fell 46.6% to $373 million. Profits for primary metal
manufacturing fell 36.1% to $477 million, following a 43.9%
increase in the fourth quarter of 2012.  Increases in five manufacturing industries partially offset
the decrease, with two posting strong profit gains in the first
quarter. Profits for chemicals, plastics and rubber products
manufacturing rose 11.6% to $2.3 billion. Wood and paper
manufacturing profits grew 126.4% to $436 million, as the
industry benefited from strong demand for lumber and building
supplies in the  United States .  Retailers’ profits increased 1.7% to $4.1 billion, with
food and beverage stores leading the first quarter increase.  Wholesalers’ profits fell 3.0% to $5.7 billion; all
industries except building material and supply wholesalers
declined.  Financial sector  First quarter operating profits fell $1.0 billion (-4.7%)
to $20.4 billion in the financial sector. A $746 million drop in
insurance carriers and related activities accounted for much of
the decline. Securities, commodity contracts and other financial
investments fell 4.2% to $5.5 billion, while depository credit
intermediation profits rose 1.5% to $8.9 billion.  Note to readers  Quarterly financial statistics are compiled using financial
information provided by enterprises that derive these data from
their financial statements. Starting on January 1, 2011,
Canadian publicly accountable enterprises are required to
replace Canadian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(CGAAP) with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
when preparing their financial statements for fiscal years
starting on or after January 1, 2011. Canadian private
enterprises are required to replace CGAAP by Accounting
Standards for Private Enterprises or IFRS. The adoption of new
accounting standards by some enterprises since the beginning of
2011 may affect comparability with prior periods.  Quarterly profit numbers referred to in this release are
seasonally adjusted and are in current dollars. The seasonally
adjusted data have been revised back to and including the first
quarter of 1999. For more information on seasonal adjustment,
see Seasonal adjustment and identifying economic trends
( http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/bsolc/olc-cel/colc-cel?catno=11-010-X201000311141&amp;lang=fra ) .  Quarterly financial statistics for the first quarter of
2010 and onward are based on the 2012 North American Industry
Classification System (NAICS). For the period prior to the first
quarter of 2010, the financial statistics are based on the 2007
NAICS.  Following reconciliation to the 2010 and 2011 annual series,
the unadjusted quarterly financial data have been revised back
to the first quarter of 2010 inclusively.  Quarterly financial statistics for enterprises are based
upon a sample survey and represent the activities of all
corporations in  Canada , except those that are government
controlled or not-for-profit. An enterprise can be a single
corporation or a family of corporations under common ownership
and/or control, for which consolidated financial statements are
produced.  Profits referred to in this analysis are operating profits
earned from normal business activities. For non-financial
industries, operating profits exclude interest and dividend
revenue and capital gains/losses whereas, for financial
industries, these are included, along with interest paid on
deposits.  Operating profits differ from net profits, which represent
the after-tax profits earned by corporations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
