The U.S. East Coast and California
will heat up this week, with temperatures rising to 90 degrees
Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) or higher from Washington to Boston.  “We continue to watch stronger-than-originally-expected
heat for two main areas this week and into the upcoming
weekend,”  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group LLC
in Bethesda,  Maryland , wrote in a note to clients today. “Low-to-mid 90s are expected from Washington to New York for the
second half of the week and into next weekend.”  California may see readings in the mid-90s in Sacramento
and around  Los Angeles  in the same period, he said.  Higher-than-normal temperatures in large population areas
can spur natural gas demand as more people turn to air
conditioners to keep cool.  Power plants  will account for 32
percent of U.S. gas consumption this year, Energy Information
Administration data show.  Average temperatures are expected to be at least 8 degrees
above normal from Chicago into New England and the Canadian
Maritimes from today through June 1, according to Rogers.
Readings will be about 5 degrees above normal across California.  The normal average temperature on June 1 in New York City
is 68 degrees, according to  MDA Weather Services  in
Gaithersburg, Maryland. In Boston, it’s 63; in Chicago, 64; in
Houston, 81; in  St. Louis , 72; and in Burbank, California, 67.  To contact the reporter on this story:
