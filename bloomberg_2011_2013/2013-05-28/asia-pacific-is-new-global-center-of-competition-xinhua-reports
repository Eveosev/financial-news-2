The Asia Pacific region has become
the “new global center” for geopolitical, economic and
military competition as the world’s big powers intensify efforts
for regional dominance, Xinhua  News Agency  reported, citing a
Chinese military research institute.  The U.S. has accelerated the eastward shift of its
strategic focus, and the spillover effects of  China ’s
 development  have become more prominent, the official news agency
said, citing the Strategic Review 2012 by the Center for
National Defense Policy under the Academy of Military Sciences
of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army. China’s security
environment is complex and sensitive, Xinhua said.  Still, opportunities outweigh challenges, and China remains
in a “golden period for development,” Xinhua said, citing Chen
Zhou, director of the center.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
