Asian  stocks  rose, with the regional
equities benchmark snapping a five-day losing streak, as a
weakening yen boosted the earnings outlook for Japanese
exporters and  China Taiping Insurance (966)  Holdings Co. surged after
saying it will buy its parent’s assets.  China Taiping, the first overseas-listed Chinese insurer,
jumped 15 percent in  Hong Kong . Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s
biggest carmaker, climbed 4.9 percent in Tokyo. Tokyo Electric
Power Co. sank 6 percent after  Kyodo News  said a parliamentary
committee approved a bill allowing people affected by the
Fukushima nuclear disaster to seek compensation beyond a three-year claims limit.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.4 percent to 137.37 as
of 6:14 p.m. in Hong Kong, after dropping as much as 0.6
percent. About two stocks gained for each that fell. The gauge
retreated the past five days amid speculation the  Federal
Reserve  will reduce its bond purchases as the  U.S. economy 
improves and China manufacturing data missed estimates.  “There are still a lot of international investors that
haven’t positioned themselves in Japan,”  Adrian Mowat , Hong
Kong-based chief Asia and emerging-market strategist at JPMorgan
Chase & Co., said in a Bloomberg TV interview with  Susan Li . “I
would be advising moving into consumer-related stocks. We are
going to see on-going earnings revisions. Perhaps this is a
sufficient pullback” to buy Japanese shares.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.7
percent. Markets in the U.S. and the U.K. will reopen today
after a holiday.  Regional Gauges  Japan’s Topix index rose 1.2 percent. The 30-day  historic
volatility  on the Topix climbed to 31.11, the highest since
April 2011. Even after a 9.6 percent drop in the previous three
days, Japan’s broadest equities gauge is still up 36 percent
this year. The yen fell 1 percent to 101.98 at the 3 p.m. close
of equity markets in  Tokyo  today.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained 1.2 percent. The Nikkei
Stock Average Volatility Index dropped 3.9 percent to 37.08,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 11 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  Toyota Motor rose 4.9 percent to 6,210 yen. Mazda Motor
Corp. advanced 6.5 percent to 428 yen. Mitsubishi Motors surged
14 percent to 168 yen. A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas
earnings at Japanese exporters.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index added 1.1 percent and the
Shanghai Composite Index gained 1.2 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index advanced 0.2 percent and South Korea’s Kospi index
rose 0.3 percent. Singapore’s Straits Times Index climbed 0.4
percent and Taiwan’s Taiex Index slid 0.2 percent.  Consumer Confidence  A report today probably will show U.S.  consumer confidence 
improved, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists, adding
to evidence the world’s biggest economy is recovering.  Chinese Premier  Li Keqiang  said his country is confronted
by “huge challenges” as it opens up the economy and reform
will mean slower growth.  China Taiping Insurance surged 15 percent to HK$14.20. The
company said it will buy 10.6 billion  yuan  ($1.7 billion) of
assets from its parent, issuing up to 862.7 million shares at
HK$15.39 apiece to fund the purchase.  Tokyo Electric Power Co. fell 6 percent to 612 yen. Kyodo
said Japan’s upper house committee approved a bill to allow
those affected by the Fukushima disaster to seek compensation
payments even after the expiry of a three-year statutory period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
