The forint climbed to the highest
level in five months against the euro as analysts predicted
 Hungary ’s central bank will keep  interest rate  reductions to no
more than 25 basis points at today’s meeting.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank will extend nine months of rate
cuts, lowering the benchmark to 4.5 percent from a record-low
4.75 percent, according to all 24 economists in a Bloomberg
survey. The central bank can further ease monetary policy if the
inflation outlook remains consistent with the 3 percent target
and financial market trends remain “favorable,” the Monetary
Council said in a statement last month.  Consumer prices  rose at
the slowest since June 1974 last month.  “The resilience of the currency and the plunge in
inflation gives the central bank room to cut further,” analysts
at Societe Generale SA led by  Benoit Anne  in  London , wrote in a
research report today.  Hungary’s currency strengthened 0.2 percent to 288.75 per
euro by 11:11 a.m. in Budapest, the highest level since Jan. 3
based on prices at the end of the trading day in London. The
forint has gained 3.9 percent in the past month, outperforming
all 24 emerging market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Yields
on the government’s benchmark 10-year bonds dropped one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.15 percent.  The central bank will will announce its decision at 2 p.m.
in Budapest and follow with a statement an hour later.  Consumer prices rose 1.7 percent from a year earlier in
April, after a 2.2 percent increase the previous month, data
from the statistics office in Budapest showed on May 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
