BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
biggest shipper of steelmaking coal, will seek to sell coal
assets and close high-cost mines as profitability is constrained
by cost inflation and a decline in prices.  “We will selectively pursue asset divestment opportunities
with a firm focus on value,” the Melbourne-based company said
today in a presentation for an analyst visit to its mines in
 Australia ’s Queensland state. “Assets must earn their right to
remain in the portfolio.”  BHP in February said it’s looking to sell the Gregory
steelmaking coal mine in Queensland, after last year closing one
part of the operation due to low prices. The following month the
company confirmed it’s planning to sell about 10 of its assets
across its portfolio amid a rise in debt levels after a metal
price boom driven by  China  stuttered.  “We have taken decisive action to drive costs lower,” the
company said. “Our plan will deliver substantial growth in free
cash flow.”  The stock closed little changed at A$33.98 in Sydney
yesterday. The key S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.2 percent.  “The market appears comfortably supplied in the near-term,” BHP said. “In the absence of a major supply disruption,
near-term metallurgical coal prices will be range bound.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
