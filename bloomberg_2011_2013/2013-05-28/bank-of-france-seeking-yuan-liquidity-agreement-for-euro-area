Bank of France Governor  Christian Noyer  said he’s seeking agreement among euro-area central banks
for ways of providing liquidity support in  Chinese yuan  as
countries compete for future business.  “The essential thing is liquidity backstops, either public
or private ones,” Noyer said yesterday in a Bloomberg News
interview in Paris. “On the public facility, we’re looking at
it. We’re talking about how we can have a public backstop with a
swap accord in the euro system.”  Paris is competing with London and Zurich to become the
center for  yuan  trading in Europe as China makes its currency
more widely used around the world. A swap arrangement would
allow central banks to supply yuan to commercial banks whose
customers may need that currency. The  Bank of England  said in
February that it planned to sign a deal soon on a three-year
currency swap arrangement.  A system of private liquidity arrangement is already being
put together, Noyer said.  “We’ve been working with the Hong Kong authorities, the
Chinese banks,” Noyer said. “The system is now being put in
place. The Chinese banks are very interested and the big
international banks too.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
