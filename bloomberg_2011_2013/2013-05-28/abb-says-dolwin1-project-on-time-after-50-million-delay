ABB Ltd. (ABBN) , the world’s largest maker
of power grids, said its DolWin1 offshore wind-power connection
will be completed on time after delays to launching a converter
platform contributed to $50 million in costs.  “We would expect the link to be ready for commissioning by
the end of the year,” as long as permits are obtained as
scheduled and there are no weather disruptions,  Thomas Schmidt ,
a spokesman at Zurich-based ABB, said in an e-mail.  The manufacturer won a $700 million  order  in 2010 to supply
an 800-megawatt transmission link from the DolWin1 offshore wind
farms in the  North Sea  to the German grid. Chief Executive
Officer Joe Hogan said on Oct. 25 that the sailing date for the
converter platform was postponed as ABB awaited regulatory
clearance. Delays to DolWin1 led to charges of $50 million last
year, Antonio Ligi, an ABB spokesman, said today.  ABB  rose  as much as 1.8 percent to 21.75 Swiss francs, the
biggest intraday gain since May 3, and was trading up 1.6
percent at 2:43 p.m. in Zurich. The stock has increased 20
percent this year, valuing the equipment maker at 50.3 billion
francs ($51.9 billion).  DolWin2 , a larger offshore connection deal worth about $1
billion that will be commissioned in 2015, is progressing on
schedule, and the fabrication of the offshore platform is making
good progress, Schmidt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
