Tropical Storm Ophelia swept across
the Avalon Peninsula in southeastern  Newfoundland  on a track
toward the U.K., the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.  Ophelia, with top winds of 60 miles (97 kilometers) an
hour, was downgraded to a post-tropical system about 110 miles
north-northeast Cape Race, Newfoundland, the Miami-based center
said at 11 a.m. in its  last  advisory on the storm. While the
storm was causing dangerous surf as it sped east-northeast at 37
mph, tropical storm watches for the peninsula were dropped.  Ophelia formed in the Atlantic on Sept. 20, the 15th named
storm of the 2011  hurricane season , and quickly fell apart. It
re-emerged as a tropical storm Sept. 28 near the Leeward Islands
and grew into a major Category 4 hurricane before losing
strength again in the colder waters of the northern Atlantic.  In the mid-Atlantic, Tropical Storm Philippeâ€™s winds
increased to 65 mph from 50 earlier today as it moved west-
southwest at 12 mph, the hurricane center said. Philippe is
about 730 miles southeast of  Bermuda  and is expected to  curve
northeast  on a path east of the island later this week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
