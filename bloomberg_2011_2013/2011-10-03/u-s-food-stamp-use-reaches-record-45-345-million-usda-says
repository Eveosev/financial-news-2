The number of Americans receiving
 food stamps  reached a record 45.345 million in July, the
government said.  The number was 0.4 percent higher than the previous month
and 8.4 percent more than a year earlier, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said today in  statement  on its website. Numbers had
fallen in June because of a decrease in people needing emergency
assistance related to storms and flooding. Assistance rolls are
increasing again as joblessness remains at 9.1 percent of the
U.S. workforce.  Participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program had set records every month since December 2008, during
a global financial crisis that caused more than $2 trillion of
writedowns and credit losses. Texas had  the most  food-stamp
recipients in July, 4.051 million, followed by  California  with
3.776 million, according to the USDA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
