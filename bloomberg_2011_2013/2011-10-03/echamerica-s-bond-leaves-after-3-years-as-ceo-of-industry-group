Phil Bond, chief executive officer
and president of TechAmerica, who led the technology industry
group’s formation, resigned yesterday after three years as CEO.  Bond was replaced by Daniel Varroney, the organization’s
chief operating officer, who will act as interim CEO, according
to a TechAmerica statement. Varroney has in the past served as
president and COO of American Solutions, which was  Newt Gingrich ’s political action committee, and president and CEO of
the Association for Corporate Growth, which advocates mid-sized
companies’ interests.  TechAmerica represents technology industry interests on
behalf of almost 1,000 member companies, including  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ,
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  and  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) ,
according to the Washington-based group’s website.  The organization was formed under Bond’s leadership from
the merger of the American Electronics Association, the Cyber
Security Industry Alliance, the Information Technology
Association of America and the Government Electronics and
Information Technology Association.  “Some five and half years ago, it was Phil’s initiative
that launched the effort to combine strengths and skills and
rebrand them ’TechAmerica,’ the largest advocacy group
representing the U.S. technology sector,” Peter Boni, chairman
of the TechAmerica’s board of directors and chief executive
officer of Safeguard Scientifics, Inc., said in the statement.  Bond said in the statement he was “leaving to pursue
another opportunity” and did not provide further details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
