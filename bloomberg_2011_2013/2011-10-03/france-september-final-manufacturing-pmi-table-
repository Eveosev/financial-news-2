Markit Economics today released the September Final
CDAF purchasing managers’ index for  France .
The PMI’s are designed to provide a single figure snap-shot for France
and to provide the most up-to-date picture of business conditions.
It is based on a survey of over 400 companies based in the French
manufacturing sector.
Anything above 50 indicates expansion; below 50, a contraction.
The greater the divergence from 50, the greater the rate of change.
