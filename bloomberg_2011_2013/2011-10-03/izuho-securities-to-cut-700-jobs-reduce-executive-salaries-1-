Mizuho Securities Co., a unit of
 Japan ’s third-largest banking group, said it will eliminate
about 700 jobs, 10 percent of its workforce, and temporarily cut
salaries for the top two executives to improve profitability.  Mizuho will begin offering an early retirement program to
300 people this month and cut a further 400 through unspecified
measures to trim personnel expenses, the brokerage said on its
website today. It plans to reduce costs by 15 percent for the
fourth quarter from a year earlier, according to the statement.  “We see the severe business environment continuing and
decided to carry out this reconstructing program,” the Tokyo-
based firm said in the statement.  The unit of  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411)  will reduce pay for
Chairman Keisuke Yokoo and President Hiroshi Motoyama by 25
percent each month for the six months ending March 31, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
