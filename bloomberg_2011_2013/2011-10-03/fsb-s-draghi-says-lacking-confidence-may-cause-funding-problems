Financial Stability Board Chairman
 Mario Draghi , who will replace European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  next month, said a lack of confidence may be
among the reasons for lenders’ “funding problems.”  “It’s very hard to distinguish between whether the funding
problems are actually liquidity problems or whether they come
from the lack of confidence in the banking system,” Draghi said
at a briefing in Zurich today. He declined to comment on who
will replace him as head of the FSB once he takes over the
Frankfurt-based central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
