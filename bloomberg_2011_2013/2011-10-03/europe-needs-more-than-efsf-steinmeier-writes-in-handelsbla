Europe  needs a 10-year road map to
political union as the European Financial Stability Facility is
“just one step toward stabilizing” the euro region, German
opposition leader Frank-Walter Steinmeier wrote in Handelsblatt.  The union would include a “harmonized”  tax policy , a common
strategy for systemically important banks and unified rules for
financial markets, Steinmeier said in an opinion piece to appear
in tomorrow’s Handelsblatt, according to the daily’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
