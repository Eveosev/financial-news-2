February 2036 to August 2041. The purchases are the first in the
Fed’s new program to replace $400 billion of short-term debt in
its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries in an effort to reduce
borrowing costs further and counter rising risks of a recession.  The central bank plans to purchase from $2.25 billion to
$2.75 billion of securities today, according to the New York
