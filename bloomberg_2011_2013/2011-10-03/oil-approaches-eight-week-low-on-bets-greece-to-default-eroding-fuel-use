Oil fell to the lowest level in more
than a year in  New York  on concern that  Greece  will default on
debt payments, leading to slower global economic growth and
lower fuel consumption.  Futures tumbled 2 percent as European finance ministers
clashed about expanding the capacity of the European Financial
Stability Facility at a meeting today in Luxembourg to determine
whether Greece has done enough to mitigate the threat. Oil pared
earlier declines after an index of U.S. manufacturing
unexpectedly increased in September.  “The worries about Greece and  Europe  continue to put
pressure on  oil prices ,” said  Tom Bentz , a broker with BNP
Paribas Commodity Futures Inc. in New York. “The markets are
still worried about demand and how what’s going on in Europe is
going to affect demand. U.S. data has been a little bit more
optimistic.”  Crude for November delivery fell $1.59 to $77.61 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest settlement since
Sept. 28, 2010. Prices have dropped 15 percent this year.  Brent oil for November settlement slid $1.05, or 1 percent,
to $101.71 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange.  The Greek government said today it passed a new budget
backed by its international creditors, including larger deficits
than previously forecast, as the country moves closer to
securing an 8 billion-euro ($10.7 billion) aid payout needed to
avoid default.  Greek Measures  Prime Minister George Papandreou’s Cabinet also passed 6.6
billion euros of austerity measures yesterday to cut the 2012
deficit to 6.8 percent of gross domestic product, missing the
6.5 percent goal previously set with the European Union,
 International Monetary Fund  and  European Central Bank , known as
the troika. Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos previously said
Greece would miss the targets.  “Investors in general are very concerned about the
economic outlook in both the U.S. and in Europe, with the
sovereign debt crisis,” said Adam Sieminski, chief energy
economist at Deutsche Bank AG in  Washington  said on “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with Ken Prewitt and  Tom Keene . “The combination
of both of these things has been pretty deadly to GDP
forecasts.”  Technical Support  New York oil futures may test technical support at around
$74 a barrel and $64 a barrel, levels that correspond with the
50 and 62 percent retracement levels on a Fibonacci study from
oil’s lows in January 2009, said  Stephen Schork , president of
Schork Group Inc., an energy advisory company in Villanova,
Pennsylvania.  “We’re in a well-defined bearish trend in all commodities,
especially crude oil and natural gas, and we’re gunning for a
sub-$75 level,” he said.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities tumbled
1.1 percent to 584.44 at 3:05 p.m. in New York. Earlier, it
touched 580.22, the lowest intraday level since Dec. 1.  Oil also fell as the euro dropped to an eight-month low
against the dollar, curbing commodities’ appeal an alternative
investment to the U.S. currency. The euro dropped 1.2 percent to
$1.323 at 3:05 p.m. in New York. Earlier, it touched $1.3192,
its lowest level since Jan. 13.  “Crude oil is still driven to a large extent by the dollar
and equities,” said  Kyle Cooper , director of research for IAF
Advisors in Houston. “Crude and equities are going to go into
lockstep as they try to determine whether the  U.S. economy  is
going to back into recession.”  Equities Decline  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 1.8 percent to
1,111.38, and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  decreased 155.08
points, or 1.4 percent, to 10,758.08 at 3:06 p.m. in New York.  Markets rebounded after the Institute for Supply Management
reported its U.S. factory index rose to 51.6 in September from
50.6 the prior month. The Tempe, Arizona-based group’s index was
forecast to slip to 50.5 based on the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of economists. A reading of 50 is the dividing
line between an expansion and a contraction in manufacturing.  “It confirms that even if U.S. economic growth is slow,
it’s still growing,” said Jason Schenker, the president of
Prestige Economics, an energy advisory company in Austin,  Texas .
“This is a step in the right direction but it’s not enough to
counter other broad-based concerns.”  Hedge funds  cut bullish bets on oil by the most in seven
weeks on concern that economic growth will falter. The funds and
other large speculators reduced wagers on rising prices by 7.4
percent in the week ended Sept. 27, according to the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission’s Commitments of Traders report
released Sept. 30. It was the largest decline since Aug. 9.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 637,018
contracts as of 3:07 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 694,856
contracts Sept. 30, 5.7 percent above the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.41 million contracts, the
highest level since Sept. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
