The Indian government’s plan to boost
its borrowings for the next six months by 32 percent is “not
surprising” and is “within the scope of expectations,” said
 Takahira Ogawa , Singapore-based director of sovereign and
international public finance ratings at  Standard & Poor’s .  The nation’s budget deficit in the fiscal year ending March
31 will be wider than the government’s estimate of a four-year
low of 4.6 percent, he said in an e-mail today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
