The Spanish airline Iberia Lineas
Aereas de Espana SA today flew the country’s first commercial
flight, on an  Airbus A320  from Madrid to Barcelona using a blend
of fuel made from the inedible camelina plant.  The fuel was produced by UOP LLC, a unit of U.S.-based
 Honeywell International Inc. (HON) , according to an e-mailed statement
today from Madrid-based Iberia. It was certified by the oil
company  Repsol YPF SA (REP) , and was mixed with traditional jet fuel
so it made up 25 percent of the total.  Airlines on July 1 won approval from ASTM International,
the U.S. technical standards body, to fly passenger planes using
fuel made from inedible plants and organic waste mixed with
petroleum-derived fuel. Approval allows for blends of up to 50
percent biofuel. Since then, airlines including  Air France-KLM (AF) 
Group and  Finnair Oyj (FIA1S)  have flown using such blends.  “The fight against climate change is one of the greatest
challenges we face, and biofuel is essential for reducing our
reliance on petroleum, increasing our competitiveness, and
achieving the ambitious emissions-reduction targets set by the
airline industry,” Iberia Chairman Antonio Vazquez said in the
statement. The number of passengers on board weren’t disclosed.  The International Air Transport Association, an industry
group, set a target five years ago to eliminate carbon dioxide
from air travel by 2050.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
