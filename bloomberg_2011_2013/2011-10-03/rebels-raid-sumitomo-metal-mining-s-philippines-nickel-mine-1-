Sumitomo Metal Mining Co.,  Japan ’s
largest nickel producer, said rebels raided its Taganito nickel
mining project in the  Philippines  today.  No demands have been received from the rebels, according to
a statement from the company. While four of its staff were
confirmed safe, there are no reports on the safety of Japanese
construction workers at the site, the statement said.  The Tokyo-based company is investing $1.3 billion in the
project to boost nickel production. Sumitomo Metal Mining said
last September it planned to start operations at the mine in
August 2013.  Philippine authorities said earlier today rebels raided the
site in Surigao del Norte, a province in the south of the
country, and held one of its managers.  Another group of rebels constructed road blocks near the
area, police Chief Superintendent Agrimero Cruz said in a mobile
phone message today. Government troops have been sent to the
site, Army Spokesman Major Eugenio Osias said by phone.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
