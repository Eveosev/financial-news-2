U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  said  strike action  by public-sector workers on
Nov. 30 to oppose curbs to pensions is “totally
irresponsible.”  “To go on strike at a time like this when you’re being
offered pensions far more generous than other people could ever
afford will hit growth and cost jobs,” Osborne said in a speech
to the Conservative Party conference in Manchester, northern
 England , today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
