The Liberal government led by Robert Ghiz won a renewed majority in Prince  Edward Island , Canada’s
smallest province, in the first of three provincial elections to
be held this week.  Unofficial results posted yesterday by the province’s
 elections agency  showed the Liberals winning 22 of 27 districts
with 51 percent of the vote, while the Conservatives under Olive
Crane took the other five districts and 40 percent of the vote.  Before the election, the Liberals held 24 districts, the
Conservatives had two and there was one vacancy.  The election is the first of several among Canadian
provinces. Manitoba’s New Democratic Party government will try
for a fourth straight mandate tonight, with public opinion polls
suggesting a close contest with the main opposition Progressive
Conservative Party. On Oct. 6, voters in  Canada ’s most populous
province, Ontario, will decide whether Liberal Dalton McGuinty’s
government will be re-elected, with challenges from both the
Progressive Conservatives under Tim Hudak and the  New Democrats 
under Andrea Horwath.  Next week, there will be elections in Newfoundland and
Labrador, as well as Yukon Territory, while Saskatchewan voters
go to the polls in November.  Also last night, voters in the  Northwest Territories 
elected representatives in 19 districts. The elected members,
who do not belong to political parties, will meet over the next
week to chose a leader among themselves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
