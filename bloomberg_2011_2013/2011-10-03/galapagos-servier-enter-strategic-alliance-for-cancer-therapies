Galapagos NV (GLPG)  and Servier of  France 
have entered a strategic alliance to develop new cancer
therapies that could potentially result in as much as 260
million euros in milestone payments for Galapagos.  Galapagos will be responsible for the discovery and
development of new candidate drugs against the companiesâ€™
combined oncology targets. Servier will have an exclusive option
to license each small molecule program after the completion of
pre-clinical development by Galapagos.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
