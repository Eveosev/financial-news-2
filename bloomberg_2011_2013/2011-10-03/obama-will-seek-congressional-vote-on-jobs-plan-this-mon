President  Barack Obama  said he would
talk to the Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress and
ask for votes on his jobs plan before the end of the month.  “Pass it,” Obama said during a Cabinet meeting today at
the White House. “Get it to my desk.”  The president, speaking to reporters at the beginning of
the meeting, said he will be “insisting that we have a vote”
on his $447 billion proposal when he talks with the bipartisan
leadership of the  House of Representatives  and the Senate.  Obama said of Republicans: “If there are aspects of the
bill that they don’t like, they should tell us what it is that
they’re not willing to go for.”  Since announcing the plan on Sept. 8, Obama has hit the
road to promote his proposal, which calls for payroll tax cuts,
hiring incentives for small businesses and spending to keep
teachers employed and repair roads and bridges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
