The  St. Louis  Cardinals beat the
Philadelphia Phillies 5-4 to tie their Major League Baseball
first-round playoff series at one game apiece.  The Cardinals trailed 4-0 after two innings and rallied to
score five runs off Phillies starting pitcher  Cliff Lee  at
Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia. Lee allowed 12 hits,
including a run-scoring single by Albert Pujols in the seventh
inning that gave St. Louis its first lead.  The best-of-five National League Division Series now heads
to St. Louis for the next two games. Game 3 is scheduled for
Oct. 4, with Game 4 the following day.  The Detroit Tigers defeated the  New York  Yankees 5-3
earlier today to even their American League playoff series at
one game apiece.  Miguel Cabrera  drove in three runs for the
Tigers, while Max Scherzer took a shutout into the seventh
inning at Yankee Stadium in New York.  The Milwaukee Brewers hold a 2-0 lead in a postseason
series for the first time after beating the Arizona Diamondbacks
9-4. The Brewers scored five runs in the sixth inning to snap a
4-4 tie at Miller Park in Milwaukee.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
