Novacaixagalicia, the Spanish savings
bank that owns 8.75 percent of  Sacyr Vallehermoso SA (SYV) , urged
Sacyr Chairman Luis Del Rivero to resolve his dispute with
 Repsol YPF SA (REP) , the bank said.  The lender’s representatives on the Sacyr board told Del
Rivero ending the row was the best way to achieve its aims of
increasing its income from Repsol dividends, a spokesman said.
The board met Sept. 30 and carried on discussions today, Efe
newswire reported.  A Sacyr spokesman didn’t return two calls seeking comment.  Repsol Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Antonio Brufau
last week began the process of having Del Rivero kicked off the
oil company’s board after Sacyr made an alliance with  Petroleos
Mexicanos  to curb Brufau’s power. Sacyr, the biggest holder in
Repsol, and Pemex said they want a CEO appointed alongside
Brufau and to refocus the company on its main oil business.  The two companies own almost 30 percent of Repsol’s shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
