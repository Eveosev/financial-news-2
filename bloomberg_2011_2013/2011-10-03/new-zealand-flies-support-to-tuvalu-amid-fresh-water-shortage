New Zealand â€™s government flew
emergency supplies and personnel to the Pacific Island nation of
Tuvalu today to deal with a severe fresh-water shortage, Foreign
Affairs Minister Murray McCully said.  An air force C-130 Hercules arrived with supplies including
two desalination plants and water containers as well as ministry
officials, McCully said in a statement on the New Zealand
government website.  Tuvalu, about 3,200 kilometers (1,980 miles) north of New
Zealand, has declared a state of emergency due to water
shortages in the capital Funafuti and on a number of outer
islands, McCully said. New Zealand will be working with partners
to consider the best medium-to-long-term response, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
