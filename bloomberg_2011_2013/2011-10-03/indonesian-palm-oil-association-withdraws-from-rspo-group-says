The Indonesian  Palm Oil  Association
has officially withdrawn its membership from the Roundtable on
Sustainable Palm Oil, the industry group said on its website.  The association left the group on Sept. 29 as the
Indonesian government will be implementing its own sustainable
palm oil ruling, Fadhil Hasan, its  executive director  said by
phone from Jakarta today.  The roundtable comprises of oil-palm growers, processors,
traders, consumer-goods manufacturers, retailers, banks and
investors, and environmental and non-governmental organizations
involved in global standards for palm oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
