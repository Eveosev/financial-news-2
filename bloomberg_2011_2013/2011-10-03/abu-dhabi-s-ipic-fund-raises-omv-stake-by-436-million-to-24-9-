International Petroleum Investment
Co.,  Abu Dhabi ’s wealth fund, invested about 327 million euros
($436 million) to raise its stake in Austrian energy group  OMV
AG (OMV)  to 24.9 percent.  IPIC, which owns its OMV shares in a syndicate with the
Austrian government, increased the stake by 4.5 percentage
points, Vienna-based OMV said in a statement.  IPIC’s increased stake doesn’t change the syndicate deal,
state assets agency OeIAG said in a statement. The agency owns
31.5 percent of OMV, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  OMV last month presented new Chief Executive Officer
Gerhard Roiss’s plan to sell 1 billion euros of refining and
marketing assets by 2014 to increase its focus on exploration
and production.  The group, which is central  Europe ’s biggest oil company,
expects exploration and production to account for 55 percent of
its assets by 2021 under the new strategy, up from 35 percent in
2010, while refining and marketing will fall to 25 percent from
53 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
