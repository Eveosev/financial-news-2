The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  slid 1.6
percent to 1,344.66 by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, paring an
earlier decline of 3.7 percent. The dollar-denominated RTS Index
slipped 3.7 percent to 1,291.7.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
Russian market today. Stock symbols are in parenthesis.  OAO Razgulay (GRAZ RX), the Russian sugar producer, slid to
its lowest level since April 2009, losing 2.2 percent to 29.06
rubles. White sugar dropped 1.7 percent to $652.3 a ton on the
NYSE Liffe Exchange in  London .  OAO Sberbank (SBER03 RX),  Russia ’s biggest lender, slid for
a second day, losing 3.1 percent to 68.34 rubles as the
country’s currency continued its slide against the dollar. A
weaker ruble encourages Russians to withdraw and convert ruble
deposits, Sberbank’s main source of funding.  OAO Transneft (TRNFP RX), the Russian oil pipeline monopoly
operator, fell for the first day in three as crude slipped below
$79 a barrel. The shares dropped as much as 6.3 percent and last
