U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  said further quantitative easing is a matter for
the Bank of  England .  “On quantitative easing, that must be a matter for an
independent Bank of England,” Osborne told BBC television in
Manchester, northern England. He said the government respects
the procedures laid down on bank independence by the previous
government and “I intend to stick exactly to those procedures,
I respect the independence of the bank in that regard.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
