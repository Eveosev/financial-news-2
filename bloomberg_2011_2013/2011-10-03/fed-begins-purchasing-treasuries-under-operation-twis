The  Federal Reserve  began buying
Treasuries as part of its program to replace $400 billion of
short-term debt in its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries in
an effort to reduce borrowing costs.  The central bank listed 15 securities maturing from
February 2036 to August 2041 for possible purchase between 10:15
a.m. and 11 a.m. New York time, according to a Federal Reserve
Bank of New York statement  today .  The Fed will purchase $44 billion of longer-maturity
Treasuries and sell the same amount of shorter-term debt in
October under a monetary stimulus plan thatâ€™s become known as
Operation Twist. The central banks will acquire between $2.25
billion to $2.75 billion of Treasuries today.  The Fed will buy  Treasury securities  13 times a month and
sell its holdings of  U.S. government debt  six times, the New
York Fed said on Sept. 26. The Fed will sell $8 billion to $9
billion of nominal Treasuries five times a month per operation
and $1 billion to $1.5 billion of TIPS, in one operation. The
Fed will buy Treasuries 12 times a month and TIPS once a month.  The Fed also announced last month that it would switch the
reinvestment of its holdings of maturing housing debt to
mortgage-backed securities from Treasuries. The  New York Fed 
said this week it plans to buy $10 billion of agency mortgage-
backed securities between Oct. 3 and Oct. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
