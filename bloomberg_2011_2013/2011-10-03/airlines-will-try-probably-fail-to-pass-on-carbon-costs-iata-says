Airlines will try to pass on the
costs of European Union carbon allowances to customers and
probably fail because there is so much price competition in the
industry, said the  International Air Transport Association .  “Airlines will try to recover” the cost of allowances,
Antony Tyler, chief executive officer of the industry
association, said today in an interview in  London . “It’s naive
to think they will” succeed, he said, because airlines are
largely price takers when it comes to setting fares, rather than
price makers.  The EU last week  set benchmarks  to calculate the
distribution of free carbon-dioxide permits among domestic and
international airlines when they join the bloc’s emissions-
trading system next year.  The EU decided in 2008 that international aviation should
become a part of the world’s largest cap-and-trade program after
airline discharges in Europe doubled over two decades. U.S.
carriers including  AMR Corp. (AMR) ’s  American Airlines  and United
Continental Holdings Inc. are challenging the carbon plan in
court, arguing the EU exceeds its jurisdiction.  The plan is “misguided” because it’s not global and
creates market distortions, Tyler said.  The industry’s global sales will advance 6.4 percent next
year to $632 billion, according to IATA forecasts. Net profit
will fall 29 percent to $4.9 billion, providing a profit-to-
sales margin of 0.8 percent, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
