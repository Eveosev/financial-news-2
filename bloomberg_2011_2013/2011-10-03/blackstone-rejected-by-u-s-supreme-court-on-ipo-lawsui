The U.S. Supreme Court refused to
halt a proposed investor class-action suit that accuses
 Blackstone Group LP (BX) , the largest private-equity firm, of making
inadequate disclosures before its 2007 initial public offering.  The justices today turned away an appeal from Blackstone,
leaving intact a federal appeals court’s conclusion that the
complaint made plausible allegations that the company omitted
material information in its initial public offering prospectus
and registration statement. The rebuff lets the litigation move
ahead to the evidence gathering stage.  The investors claim Blackstone Chairman Stephen Schwarzman,
and other officials, knew about problems at two companies in
which the New York-based firm had a stake, including one that
issued securities tied to subprime mortgages.  The complaint also alleges that Blackstone misrepresented
the prospects for its real estate investments by stating in its
registration statement that the industry “is experiencing
historically high levels of growth and liquidity.”  The case is Blackstone Group v. Litwin, 11-15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
