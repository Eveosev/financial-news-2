U.S. stocks may decline over the next
two to three weeks before rallying as much as 20 or 30 percent,
according to a technical analyst at Market Securities who uses
DeMark indicators.  “The odds are pretty positive for this month and
quarter,” Jean-Charles Gand, head of  technical analysis  at
Market Securities in Geneva and former president of the French
Association of Technical Analysts, wrote in a report today.
“The S&P has a chance to rally over the next couple of weeks,”
he wrote, adding that there’s a risk of a selloff before the
gains.  A buy signal for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was
triggered last week after 13 trading days on which the gauge
closed at a lower level than the intra-day lows two days
previously, Gand said, citing indicators developed by Tom DeMark
of Market Studies LLC.  “The buy signal will be confirmed with the first close
greater than the close four price bars earlier,” Gand said in a
phone interview from Geneva. “Today, for example, the S&P would
have to close higher than the close on Sept. 27 at 1,175.38.”  The  S&P 500  may form a bottom at 1,030 in the next two to
three weeks before rallying as much as 20 or 30 percent, Gand
said by phone.  The S&P 500 fell 0.1 percent to 1,130.22 at 10:26 a.m. in
 New York . The benchmark gauge for American equities declined 0.4
percent last week, capping the worst quarterly loss since the
end of 2008, as the sovereign-debt crisis in Europe and concern
that the global economy is slowing overshadowed improving
reports in the U.S.  “This will be a countertrend rally, not a start of a  bull
market ,” Gand said. “While timing and seasonality are
encouraging, I’d stay cautious on equities in the long term. We
should see another downtrend in the first half of 2012.”  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study price
graphs to predict changes in a security, commodity, currency or
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
