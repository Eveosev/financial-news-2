Duke Energy Corp. (DUK)  offered to sell
some electricity at its cost plus 10 percent to ease regulatory
concern about competition in wholesale power markets from its
$15.3 billion purchase of Progress Energy Inc.  Duke, based in Charlotte, proposed a so-called virtual
divestiture of power capacity in a filing today with the  North
Carolina  Utilities commission.  Duke proposes to sell 800 megawatt-hours of cost-plus power
from June 1 to Aug. 31 for eight years. It would sell 225
megawatt-hours of cost-plus power from Dec. 1 to the end of
February.  “I think this is going to be enough to satisfy FERC,”
 Angie Storozynski , a utility analyst for Macquarie Capital USA
Inc. in New York, said in a telephone interview.  The  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  said in an  order 
issued Sept. 30 that the transaction may have “an adverse
effect on competition.” To prevent the combined company from
being able to manipulate electricity prices in North and South
Carolina, the commission suggested selling plants and some power
under long-term agreements, building new transmission lines or
letting a third party operate the company’s grid.  A more detailed proposal will be filed with the federal
commission, Duke spokesman Tom Williams said today in an
interview.  Duke rose 1 percent to $19.79 at the close in New York.
Progress, based in Raleigh, North Carolina, rose 0.7 percent to
$50.38.  To contact the reporter on this story:
