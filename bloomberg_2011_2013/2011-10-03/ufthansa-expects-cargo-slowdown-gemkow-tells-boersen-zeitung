Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  expects its
cargo business to be weaker in coming months as economic growth
slows,  Boersen-Zeitung  reported, citing Chief Financial Officer
Stephan Gemkow.  The airline cut its profit target last month after its BMI
and Germanwings units had a poor August, the newspaper said in
an article on its Web site, citing an interview that will appear
in tomorrowâ€™s edition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
