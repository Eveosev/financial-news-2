Mexico ’s economy will grow more than
4 percent this year, President Felipe Calderon said.  “We have a strong economy even though we face difficult
international conditions,” Calderon said at a conference in
Mexico City today.  Calderon’s growth estimate is faster than the 3.77 percent
expansion forecast by economists in a monthly central bank
survey published today.  Now is a suitable moment for  Latin America ’s second biggest
economy to approve structural reforms, Calderon said. Speaking
at the same conference, Mexico’s central bank Governor Agustin Carstens said changes in the labor and energy sectors are needed
to boost domestic growth amid the global slowdown.  More than 111,000 formal jobs were created in September and
more than 600,000 this year, Calderon said.  Mexico’s biggest development bank, Nacional Financiera SNC,
known as Nafinsa, will grant 75 billion pesos ($5.4 billion) in
credits this year, Calderon said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
