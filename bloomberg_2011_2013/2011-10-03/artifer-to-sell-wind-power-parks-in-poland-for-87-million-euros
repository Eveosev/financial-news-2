Martifer SGPS SA (MAR) , a Portuguese
manufacturer of metal structures, agreed to sell wind farm
projects in  Poland  to the Ikea Group for 87 million euros ($116
million) to cut debt.  The Leki Dukielskie and Bukowsko projects are already
operating, Oliveira de Frades, Portugal-based Martifer said
today in a regulatory filing. The sale of the Rymanow project
will be concluded after the park is built and connected to the
grid in 2013.  “Martifer’s strategic plan points to a reduction of assets
in the area of wind energy generation,” Chief Financial Officer
Mario Couto said in an e-mail. Martifer’s capacity in operating
wind energy parks is 33.6 megawatts and it has 68 megawatts
under construction in Romania, he said.  The company plans to cut debt to 230 million euros to 250
million euros in 2013 from 401 million euros at the end of the
first half. It’s seeking growth in areas other than  wind energy ,
including contracts for work on soccer stadiums in  Brazil .  “With the slowdown in growth in the wind sector, this
business has become only a segment of metal construction,”
Couto said. “In terms of renewable energy, Martifer is focused
on the solar photovoltaic sector.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
