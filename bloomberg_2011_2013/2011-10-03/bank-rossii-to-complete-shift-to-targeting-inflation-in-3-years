Russia ’s central bank plans to
complete its transition to targeting inflation by the end of
2014, Bank Rossii said.  The regulator will “maintain its presence on  currency
markets  exclusively to limit excess volatility of the  exchange
rate , without influencing its trajectory as determined by
fundamental factors,” Bank Rossii said in a draft three-year
plan for its monetary policy published on its website today.  Policy makers are targeting a more flexible ruble to shield
the economy from external shocks and make monetary policy more
effective. Bank Rossii widened a band in which it allows the
ruble to trade to five rubles from four earlier this year. There
are no plans to change the corridor in the coming weeks, central
bank Chairman Sergey Ignatiev said last week.  Net capital outflows may reach $36 billion this year, up
from an estimated $31.2 billion for the first half, according to
the plan. Alexei Ulyukayev, a central bank first deputy
chairman, said May 31 that outflows may reach $30 billion to $35
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
