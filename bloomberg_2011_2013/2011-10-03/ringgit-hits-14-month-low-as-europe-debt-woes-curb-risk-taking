Malaysia’s ringgit sank to a 14-month
low as concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen, deterring risk-
taking and sapping demand for emerging-market assets.  The currency weakened for a fourth day as investors favored
the relative safety of the greenback, driving the Dollar Index
to its highest level since January, before European finance
ministers meet today to weigh the threat of a Greek default.
Overseas investors trimmed their holdings of ringgit-denominated
debt in August to 186 billion ringgit ($58 billion), from a
record 186.5 billion ringgit at the end of July, central bank
 data  show. That’s the first reduction since November.  “ Risk aversion  is back in play,” said Akira Banno, a
treasury adviser at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in  Kuala
Lumpur . “Lingering concerns over Europe’s debt crisis will
continue to weigh on emerging-market assets.”  The ringgit fell 0.4 percent to 3.2055 per dollar as of
4:16 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, after a 7 percent slide in September
that was the biggest loss since 1998, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The currency touched 3.2200, the weakest level
since July 22, 2010.  Greece ’s government approved 6.6 billion euros ($8.8
billion) of austerity measures, including firing state workers,
to trim its  budget deficit  and qualify for bailout funds. The
nation is seeking to secure disbursement of an 8 billion-euro
loan payout this month and a second rescue of 109 billion euros
agreed to by European Union leaders on July 21.  Malaysia’s government bonds were unchanged. The yield on
the 3.434 percent notes due August 2014 held at 3.23 percent,
according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
