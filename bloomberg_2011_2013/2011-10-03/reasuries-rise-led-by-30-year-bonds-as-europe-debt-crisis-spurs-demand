Treasury 30-year bonds rose, pushing
yields to the lowest level since January 2009, as the  Federal
Reserve  bought $2.5 billion of longer-term debt and European
fiscal concern overshadowed U.S. economic reports.  The extra yield for holding long bonds instead of five-year
notes was the lowest in almost two years after the Fed started
the program known as Operation Twist. Yields on 10-year notes
briefly pared their decrease as the  Institute for Supply
Management  reported manufacturing unexpectedly accelerated.  “Although economic data in the U.S. is improving, the
major concern is on  Europe ,” said Jason Rogan, director of U.S.
government trading in New York at Guggenheim Partners LLC, a
brokerage for institutional investors. “We’ve seen Treasuries
rally since the initial sell-off when ISM was announced. We’ll
be watching Europe very closely.”  Yields on 30-year bonds fell 19 basis points, or 0.19
percentage point, to 2.73 percent at 4:59 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3.75 percent
securities maturing in August 2041 rose 4 1/4, or $42.50 per
$1,000 face amount, to 120 27/32. The yields reached the lowest
in almost three years.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 2.9 percent,
falling below 1,100 for the first time in more than a year.
Crude oil for November delivery fell 3 percent to $75.80 a
barrel in New York.  The long-bond yields dropped 146 basis points in the third
quarter, the biggest decrease since a plunge of 164 basis points
in the last three months of 2008.  Ten-Year Notes  A one-point gain in benchmark 10-year notes today pushed
yields down as much as 15 basis points to 1.76 percent, the
lowest level since Sept. 23, when the record low of 1.6714
percent was set. Five-year note yields dipped 10 basis points to
0.85 percent.  The spread between five- and 30-year securities decreased
to 189 basis points, the narrowest on a closing basis since
October 2009.  The Fed bought Treasuries maturing from February 2036
through August 2041 today. Fourteen of the 15 securities listed
for possible purchase were acquired, according to a New York Fed
statement.  “If you know a big buyer is coming in, you don’t want to
be caught short,” said  Michael Franzese , managing director and
head of Treasury trading at Wunderlich Securities Inc. in New
York. “People are trying to be proactive.”  Fed Debt Buying  Today’s purchases are the first under a program announced
Sept. 21 to buy $400 billion of bonds with maturities of six to
30 years through June while selling an equal amount of debt
maturing in three years or less to keep borrowing costs down.  Treasuries returned 6.4 percent in the third quarter, the
most since the final three months of 2008, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch data show.  Bill Gross , the manager of the world’s biggest bond fund,
said the global economy risks lapsing into recession with the
pace of growth falling below the “new normal” level the firm
has predicted since 2009.  “Sovereign balance sheets resemble an overweight diabetic
on the verge of a heart attack,” Gross wrote in a monthly
investment outlook posted on  Newport Beach , California-based
Pacific Investment Management Co.’s website today. “If global
policy makers could focus on structural as opposed to cyclical
financial solutions, new normal growth as opposed to recession
might be possible.”  Economists have cut their estimates for the 10-year yield
in March 2012 to 2.56 percent, down from a projection of 3.75
percent in July, the biggest cut since January 2009.  Germany’s Stance  German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  opposed moves to
boost the European Financial Stability Facility until the final
three countries approve the fund’s latest upgrade. Slovakia, the
Netherlands and Malta have yet to ratify an earlier decision to
expand the fund to 440 billion euros ($580 billion).  “Speculating makes no sense,” Schaeuble told reporters
before a meeting of European finance ministers in Luxembourg
tonight. “We will wait until the other countries that haven’t
ratified it also do so.”  Greece ’s government pledged yesterday to fire workers as
part of a 6.6 billion-euro austerity package. The steps outlined
by Prime Minister  George Papandreou ’s government would leave a
2012 budget deficit equivalent to 6.8 percent of gross domestic
product, missing the 6.5 percent goal set with the European
Union,  International Monetary Fund  and  European Central Bank .  Manufacturing Advances  Bonds briefly pared their gains after the Institute for
Supply Management’s U.S. factory index unexpectedly increased to
51.6 in September from 50.6 in the previous month. The median
forecast of 82 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a
reduction to 50.5. A level of 50 is the dividing line between
growth and contraction in U.S. manufacturing.  Dallas Fed President  Richard Fisher  said today in an
interview on Bloomberg Radio’s “The Hays Advantage” with
 Kathleen Hays  that he is seeing “minor momentum” in the  U.S.
economy , with business officials he talks with saying they
aren’t moving backward.  “Clearly, the economy is anemic,” he said. “Our job is
to refuel the tanks; we’ve done that.” Now “it’s up to the
fiscal authorities” to do their work, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
