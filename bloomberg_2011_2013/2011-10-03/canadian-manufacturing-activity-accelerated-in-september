 Canadian manufacturing activity
picked up in September, according to the RBC Manufacturing
Purchasing Managers Index.  The manufacturing PMI is designed to provide a single figure
snap-shot for Canadian manufacturing. Anything above 50 indicates
expansion; below 50, a contraction. The greater the divergence
from 50, the greater the rate of change.
