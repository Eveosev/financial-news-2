The U.S. Supreme Court turned away
two steel-industry appeals that challenged the method used by
federal officials to calculate the duties imposed when imports
are sold in the U.S. at less than their fair value.  The justices today rejected appeals by  Nucor Corp. (NUE)  and U.S.
Steel Corp., leaving intact a lower court ruling that upheld the
Commerce Department formula in a dispute over steel duties. The
department adopted its approach after the World Trade
Organization said an earlier U.S. methodology, known as
“zeroing,” violated global trade regulations.  Nucor and U.S. Steel said the new method didn’t go far
enough to address dumping, the practice of selling goods in
another country at a loss. Trade groups representing the U.S.
lumber and shrimp industries backed the appeal.  The Commerce Department determines duties by comparing the
price of a product in the U.S. with the price in the exporter’s
domestic market. Zeroing excluded some market data in that
calculation in a way that led to higher duties.  The cases are  United States  Steel v. United States, 10-
1433, and Nucor v. United States, 10-1439.  To contact the reporter on this story:
