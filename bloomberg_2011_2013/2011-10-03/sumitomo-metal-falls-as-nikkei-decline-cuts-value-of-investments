Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd. (5405) ,
 Japan ’s third-largest steelmaker, fell to the lowest in three
weeks in Tokyo trading after booking a 79.8 billion-yen ($1
billion) charge to write down the value of its stock investments.  The steelmaker declined 3.7 percent to 156 yen at the 3 p.m.
close on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the lowest since Sept. 12.  Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average dropped 11
percent in the six months ended Sept. 30, with Sumitomo Metal’s
biggest investment  Nippon Steel Corp. (5401)  down 16 percent. The
charge will reduce Sumitomo Metal’s net income by 48 billion yen
and net assets by 8 billion yen, the company said in a statement
on Sept. 30.  Sumitomo Metal  is currently examining its earnings
forecasts for the first half and full year of fiscal 2011,
ending on March 31, 2012, according to the statement. The
steelmaker estimated in July that full-year profit will reach 50
billion yen, compared with a loss of 7.1 billion yen a year
earlier.  Nippon Steel agreed to buy Sumitomo Metal for 726.5 billion
yen, combining to become the world’s second-largest steelmaker.  To contact the reporters on this story:
