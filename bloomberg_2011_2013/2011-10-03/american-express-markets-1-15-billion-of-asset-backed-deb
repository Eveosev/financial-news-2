American Express Co. (AXP)  is marketing
$1.15 billion of bonds backed by credit card payments in its
first sale of the debt this year.  The issue may sell as soon as this week, according to a
person familiar with the offering, who declined to be identified
because terms aren’t public. The New York-based company, the
biggest credit-card issuer by purchases, last issued similar
debt in April 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Offerings of asset-backed securities tied to the payments
have plunged as banks use deposits to fund new loans. About $7
billion of the debt has been sold this year, compared with $8
billion in 2010 and $47 billion in 2009, Bloomberg data show.  Top-ranked debt tied to credit-card payments is yielding 75
basis points more than Treasuries, according to a Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index. Spreads expanded to 82 basis
points, or 0.82 percentage point, on Aug. 9, from 62 basis
points on June 1, the data show.  “Large commercial bank credit card lenders may return to
the market at some point in the future, but until then the size
of the credit card sector is likely to keep shrinking,” Wells
Fargo & Co. analysts led by John McElravey said in a report last
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
