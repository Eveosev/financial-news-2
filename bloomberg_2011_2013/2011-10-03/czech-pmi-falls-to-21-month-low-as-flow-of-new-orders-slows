Czech manufacturing growth was the
weakest in 21 months in September as the pace of new orders
slowed, an industry gauge showed.  The HSBC Czech Republic Manufacturing PMI was 52.3,
compared with 53.4 in August, the lowest reading since December
2009, the bank said today in an e-mailed report. A result
greater than 50 signals overall growth. Manufacturers received a
greater volume of new orders in September, although the rate of
growth slowed to the weakest since August 2009.  “Driving the downward movement in the headline index in
September was a weaker rise in new orders,” the bank said in
the Purchasing Managers Index report, compiled by Markit, a
financial information services company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
