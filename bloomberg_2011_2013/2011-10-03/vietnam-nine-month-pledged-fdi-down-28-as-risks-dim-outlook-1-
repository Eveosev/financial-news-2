Pledged foreign direct investment
into  Vietnam  fell 28 percent in the nine months through
September from a year earlier, the government said, as domestic
risks dim the nation’s economic outlook.  Committed investment fell to $9.9 billion in January
through September from the same period in 2010, the Foreign
Investment Agency of the Ministry of Planning and Investment
said in a statement on its website. Disbursed foreign direct
investment rose 2 percent to $8.2 billion in the same period, it
said.  Vietnam has struggled to contain  Asia ’s fastest inflation
and stabilize the national currency while supporting economic
expansion as the global recovery falters. Growth in the $104
billion economy slowed in the first three quarters of 2011, and
the government said last month it will further restrain
increases in lending to try to curb price gains.  “This year’s inflation and foreign-exchange issues put a
lot of pressure on the cost structure of any company operating
here,” said Attila Vajda, the head of institutional clients at
ACB Securities Co. in  Ho Chi Minh City . “This is being worsened
by the numerous amount of strikes, so people are waiting to see
a more stable and predictable cost structure.”  Vietnam gave licenses to 675 new projects with a combined
registered capital of $8.23 billion in January through Sept. 20,
while 178 existing projects boosted registered capital by $1.66
billion, according to the statement, which was released last
week.  Consumer prices in the Southeast Asian nation climbed 22.42
percent in September from a year earlier, easing from a 23.02
percent pace in August. September’s level remains the fastest in
a basket of 17 Asian economies tracked by Bloomberg.  Gross domestic product rose 5.76 percent in the first three
quarters of 2011, less than the 6.54 percent gain in the same
period in 2010.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam raised  interest rates  earlier
this year, before reducing its repurchase rate in July. It
devalued the dong for the fourth time in 15 months in February.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
