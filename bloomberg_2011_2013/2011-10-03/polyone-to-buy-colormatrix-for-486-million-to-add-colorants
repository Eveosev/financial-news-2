PolyOne Corp. (POL) , a U.S. supplier of
plastics and resins, agreed to buy ColorMatrix Group Inc. for
$486 million to broaden its offering to specialty additives and
colorants used in packaging.  PolyOne is adding a business that had sales of $196.8
million and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization of $43.6 million in the 12 months through June 30,
the Avon Lake, Ohio-based company said in a statement today.
Completion of the deal is expected by year end.  PolyOne, which bought GLS Corp. for $148.5 million in 2008,
views the acquisition as a “game changer” that will drive
expansion into value-added products and markets such as  Russia ,
Chief Executive Officer Stephen Newlin said. With ColorMatrix,
more than 50 percent of PolyOne’s operating profit will stem
from specialty products, compared with 2 percent in 2005.  “Since 2002, ColorMatrix has organically increased EBITDA
at an annualized growth rate of 16 percent, and our purchase
price of $486 million recognizes the earnings and growth
potential of this specialty business,” said Newlin. “We can
accelerate this growth by leveraging our global scale and
through additional investment in commercial resources, just as
we’ve done with GLS.”  PolyOne was advised by Valence Group on the deal. Privately
held ColorMatrix is based in Berea,  Ohio .  To contact the reporter on this story:
