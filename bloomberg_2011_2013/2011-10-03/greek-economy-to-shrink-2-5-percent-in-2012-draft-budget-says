Greece ’s economy will contract for a
fourth year in 2012, according to the draft budget submitted to
Parliament, which sets out fiscal and macroeconomic forecasts.  Gross domestic product will shrink 2.5 percent next year
after contracting 5.5 percent in 2011, according to the draft
budget, e-mailed by the Finance Ministry in  Athens . Unemployment
will average 16.4 percent in 2012, up from 15.2 percent this
year, and European Union-harmonized inflation will average 0.6
percent next year, compared with 2.8 percent in 2011.  “The most critical and important task we have to do in
order to get back to positive growth rates, with all that this
means for the prospects of the country and its citizens,
especially the younger ones, is to meet our fiscal and
structural goals,” Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said in
an e-mailed statement.  The  Finance Ministry  says the 2012 budget figures have been
approved by inspectors from the European Union, the
 International Monetary Fund  and the  European Central Bank , who
are assessing whether Greece has met the terms of a 110 billion-
euro ($147 billion) rescue package last year. Greece is awaiting
its next aid payout, worth 8 billion euros, to avoid default.  The general government deficit for next year will be 14.7
billion euros, or 6.8 percent of GDP, compared with 18.7 billion
euros this year, or 8.5 percent of GDP, according to the draft
budget. General government debt will reach 172.7 percent of GDP
next year from 161.8 percent this year, the budget forecast.  The central government deficit, which excludes outlays by
state-owned institutions and companies, will be 19 billion euros
next year compared with 23.8 billion euros in 2011, according to
the forecasts. Ordinary government revenue is forecast at 54.2
billion euros in 2012, a 5.1 percent increase from this year,
while ordinary  government spending  will be 70.4 billion euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
