Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. led declines
among Japanese shipping lines, dropping to the lowest in more
than eight years in  Tokyo , after predicting a net loss for the
fiscal first half.  The operator of the world’s largest merchant fleet dropped
7 percent to 279 yen at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo trading, the
lowest since March 2003. Nippon Yusen K.K.,  Japan ’s largest
shipping line by sales, fell 4.3 percent to 202 yen, and
 Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. (9107) , the third-largest, declined 4.9
percent to 155 yen.  Mitsui O.S.K. projected a 17 billion yen ($221 million)
loss for the six months ended Sept. 30, compared with a previous
forecast of 1 billion yen net income, amid a decline in shipping
rates and a stronger yen. Kawasaki Kisen today estimated it had
a net loss of 16 billion yen in the fiscal first half, according
to a preliminary earnings statement, compared with an earlier
forecast for a 2 billion yen loss.  “Until we see some positive economic signs, the slump in
shipping lines is unlikely to stop,” said  Ryota Himeno , an
analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. “It’s
difficult to predict a turnaround this year.”  Consumer spending  in the U.S., the world’s largest economy,
slowed in August and incomes unexpectedly dropped for workers,
damping the earnings outlook for shipping lines, according to
government reports on Sept. 30.  The Baltic Dry Index, a benchmark for commodity-shipping
rates, fell 0.7 percent to 1,899 points on Sept. 30. The index
has slumped 22 percent in the past year.  Mitsui O.S.K. announced its loss estimate Sept. 30 in a
filing to the Tokyo Stock Exchange after the market closed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
