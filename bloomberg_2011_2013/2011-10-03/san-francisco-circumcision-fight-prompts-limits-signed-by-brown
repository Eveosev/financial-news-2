California cities and counties no
longer will be able to pass local laws banning the practice of
male circumcision under a law signed by Governor  Jerry Brown .  Brown, a 73-year-old Democrat, signed a  bill  yesterday
inspired by San Franciscoâ€™s failed attempt to ban male
circumcision. A group called MGMbill.org decried the practice as
cruel, equating it with female genital mutilation.  The group collected signatures to put a measure on the city
ballot. A judge in July removed the measure, ruling that cities
have no power to regulate a state-licensed medical procedure.  In June, an activist  ended  a similar effort in  Santa
Monica , saying the media had misrepresented her campaign as an
attack on religious freedom, according to the Jewish Journal.  The Anti-Defamation League and the Jewish Community
Relations Council of San Francisco argued that the  San Francisco 
measure would restrict parental choice and religious freedom.
Jews and Muslims circumcise boys as a religious rite.  Male circumcision of newborns fell to 56.9 percent in 2008
from 62.5 percent in 1999, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention said in a Sept. 2  report , citing a national hospital
discharge survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
