U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  said he’d like permanent tax cuts when it is
affordable in line with the coalition government’s deficit-
reduction plan.  “I would like permanently lower taxes,” Osborne told BBC
Radio 4’s “Today” show in Manchester, northern England. “I’m
not a believer in deficit-funded tax cuts in the sense that I
cut the corporate  tax rate  one year and have to put it up
because I don’t have sound public finances.”  Tax cuts have to be part of a plan to reduce the deficit,
Osborne said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
