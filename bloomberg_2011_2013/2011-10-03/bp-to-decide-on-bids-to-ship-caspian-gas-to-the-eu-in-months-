A BP Plc-led group received bids from
three pipeline projects to ship natural gas from its Shah Deniz
field in  Azerbaijan  to Europe and will make a decision in
several months.  They include the OMV AG-led Nabucco pipeline, the
Interconnector Turkey-Greece-Italy, or ITGI, led by Edison SpA
and Depa SA, and the Trans Adriatic Pipeline led by Statoil ASA
and Elektrizitaets-Gesellschaft Laufenburg AG, Tamam Bayatli, a
BP spokeswoman in the Azeri capital Baku, said today by phone.  A fourth route connecting Turkey to southeast Europe is
also being considered, Bayatli said. The idea was floated by
London-based BP on Sept. 26, days before the bid deadline
expired on Oct. 1. BP and its partners will take “several
months” to choose from among the proposals, Bayatli said.  The European Union is looking to Shah Deniz, estimated to
contain 1.2 trillion cubic meters of gas, along with other
explored and prospective fields in the  Caspian region  to
diversify supply away from Russia and offset dwindling
production in the North Sea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
