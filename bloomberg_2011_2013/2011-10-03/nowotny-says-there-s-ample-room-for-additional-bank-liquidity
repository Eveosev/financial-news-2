European Central Bank Governing
Council member  Ewald Nowotny  reiterated he may support re-
introducing 12-month loans for banks.  “There is ample room for additional liquidity for the
banks because the banks have enough that they could give the
central banks as a security,” Nowotny said at a conference in
Vienna today. “It’s a problem that longer-term liquidity is
very difficult to achieve in the markets.”  The ECB is providing banks with unlimited liquidity for up
to six months against eligible collateral as governments
struggle to restore investor confidence in the 17-member euro
region. The debt crisis has infected the banking system, making
financial institutions wary of lending to each other and pushing
overnight deposits with the Frankfurt-based central bank last
week to the highest in more than a year.  The ECB, which last offered a 12-month loan in December
2009, has been forced to purchase  government bonds  to prevent
the crisis from spreading to larger euro nations.  Nowotny, who is also head of  Austria ’s central bank, said
the bond measure is “not a program of quantitative easing” and
that it’s “limited time-wise” to “overcome specific market
imperfections.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
