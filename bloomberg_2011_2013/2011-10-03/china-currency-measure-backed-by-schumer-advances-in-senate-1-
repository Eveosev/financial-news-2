U.S. legislation aimed at letting
American businesses seek duties on Chinese imports to make up
for the weak yuan advanced in the Senate.  The 79-19 vote today lets the Senate begin considering the
bill introduced by Democrat  Sherrod Brown  of Ohio and Charles
Schumer of New York, with 19 co-sponsors, including Republicans
Lindsey Graham of  South Carolina  and Jeff Sessions of Alabama.  The legislation, opposed by business groups such as the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce that say it may led to a trade dispute,
may stall in the Republican-controlled House. Speaker John Boehner of Ohio and Majority Leader  Eric Cantor  of Virginia both
voted against a similar measure that passed the House last year.  “The strong, bipartisan vote should send a signal to
China, as well as to the White House and House Republicans, that
voters are demanding action to defend American jobs and a level
playing field for U.S. businesses,”  Scott Paul , the executive
director of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, said in a
statement.  Schumer, who has proposed similar measures over the past
six years, has failed so far to get an up-or-down Senate vote on
such a bill. Supporters say it has a better chance of passing
the Senate this time because  China , the world’s second-biggest
economy after the U.S., has become a target for lawmakers
frustrated by the widening trade deficit with that nation and
domestic unemployment stuck at 9.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
