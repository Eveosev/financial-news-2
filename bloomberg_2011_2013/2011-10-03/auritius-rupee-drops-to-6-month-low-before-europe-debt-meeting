Mauritius’s rupee depreciated to the
weakest level in more than six months against the dollar before
European officials met to gauge the risk of a Greek default.
Stocks declined.  The Indian Ocean island nation’s currency retreated as much
as 1.5 percent to 29.35 per dollar, its lowest intraday level
since March 18, and traded 1.1 percent down to 29.25 by 2:15
p.m. in  Port Louis , the capital. Against the euro, the rupee
depreciated 0.5 percent to 39.0932.  Finance ministers from the eurozone meet today in
Luxembourg to consider how to shield banks from the debt crisis
and boosting the region’s rescue fund. Greece pledged to fire
workers as part of a 6.6 billion-euro ($8.8 billion) package to
help secure a rescue-loan payout.  “The outcome of the finance chiefs’ meeting would be a
very important factor regarding the future state of the euro
zone and its impact on its trading partners such as Mauritius,”
Imrith Ramtohul, a senior investment manager at Port Louis-based
Mauritius Union Group, said by phone. “A weaker euro would
probably imply fewer European visitors to the country and trim
earnings for our euro-centered exports.”  Europe  is the Indian Ocean island nation’s main trading
partner, with tourist arrivals from the continent comprising 62
percent of the total for the eight months through August, led by
 France , data from the Tourism Promotion Authority show.  The 38-member SEMDEX stock index fell 0.4 percent to
1,893.87 at the 1:30 p.m. close.  New Mauritius Hotels Ltd. (NMH) , the
country’s largest leisure operator by market value, led
declines, dropping 2.4 percent to 80 rupees.  State Bank of
Mauritius Ltd. (SBM) , the country’s second-largest lender, lost 1.2
percent to 86 rupees.  Buying prices for the dollar ranged from 28.2491 rupees to
28.4159 and the selling price rose to 29.7468 compared with
29.5889 on Sept. 30, according to  exchange rates  published today
on the Bank of Mauritius website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
