OAO Transneft, the Russian oil
pipeline monopoly operator, declined for the first day in three
as crude slipped below $79 a barrel.  The shares dropped as much as 6.3 percent and traded 4.2
percent lower at 31,406 rubles by the 6:45 p.m. Moscow close.  Crude for November delivery fell 45 cents to $78.75 a
barrel in  New York  as the growing European debt crisis curbed
demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
