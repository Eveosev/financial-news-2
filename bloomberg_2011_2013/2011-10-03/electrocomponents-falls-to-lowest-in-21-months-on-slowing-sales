Electrocomponents Plc (ECM) , the world’s
largest distributor of electronics and maintenance products,
fell to the lowest since March last year in London trading,
after it said fiscal second-quarter revenue growth slowed.  Sales in the three months ended Sept. 30 rose 8 percent
from a year earlier, the Oxford, England-based company said in a
statement today. That compared with 14 percent growth in the
previous three months. Revenue increased 5 percent in September.  “Markets are getting a bit weaker,” Chief Executive
Officer Ian Mason said in an interview. “It is more general
nervousness than anything specific. We have seen that all around
the world.”  Electrocomponents, which gets 70 percent of its sales
outside the U.K., wants to record a similar proportion through
e-commerce. The company, which introduced 20,000 new products in
the quarter, does 54 percent of its business through the
Internet, up from 47 percent a year ago.  Sales in Electrocomponents’ maintenance unit are more
resilient than electronics, Mason said. Gross margins were
maintained from a year earlier.  The shares fell as much as 9.6 percent to 171.9 pence, and
closed down 1.1 percent at 188 pence at 4:30 p.m. in  London ,
extending the decline in the second half of the year to 31
percent.  Electrocomponents refinanced with a 210 million-pound ($326
million) debt facility in the period. No debt now falls due
until 2015, Chief Financial Officer Simon Boddie said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
