Crude oil inventories in Cushing,
Oklahoma, decreased 3.1 percent on Sept. 29 from Sept. 26,
according to data compiled by  DigitalGlobe Inc. (DGI)   Stockpiles held in floating-roof tanks at the hub fell
936,000 barrels to 29.2 million, satellite images taken by the
Longmont, Colorado-based company show. The Energy Department
said this week that Cushing supplies, including floating and
fixed tanks, totaled 30.9 million barrels as of Sept. 23.  Cushing is the physical delivery point for New York
Mercantile Exchange oil futures contracts and the largest crude-
trading and storage hub in the U.S. The hub has  working storage 
capacity of 48 million barrels, according to the Energy
Department.  The  DigitalGlobe  estimate is based on images of 234
operational floating-top tanks at Cushing, the satellite company
said. There are 83 operational fixed-roof tanks at the hub.  DigitalGlobe data is released twice each week at 10:30 a.m.
New York time on Mondays and Fridays. For the Friday release,
the information is collected from the previous Saturday through
Wednesday. For the Monday release, itâ€™s from the previous
Thursday or Friday.  When clouds obscure the satellite view, data is used from
the last day in which there was a full collection. The highest
percent of collection data will be used when cloud cover
obscures images during a collection period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
