The organizers of next year’s  London
Olympics  may use security guards and cleaning people working at
the event for tips to find potential drug cheats.  “There will be targeted testing at the Games based on the
intelligence received,” Jonathan Harris, medical services
manager anti-doping at the organizing committee of the  London 
Olympics said at a conference in the British capital today.  Personnel working at next year’s Games -- such as cleaning
people and security guards -- will be “educated,” so that “if
they come across behavior that is untoward, they will come to
us,” Harris said at the ‘Science and Ethics in Sport Symposium’
today.  A record 5,000 drug tests will be collected from 10,000
athletes competing at the London Olympics, Harris said.  Based on the information received, “some athletes could be
tested more than once during the Games,” Harris said.  GlaxoSmithKline Plc, the U.K.’s biggest drug maker, will be
providing equipment and facilities for an anti-doping laboratory
that will be run by  King’s College London  during the Games.  The  International Olympic Committee  in July said athletes
will be banned from possessing syringes and other medical
equipment during the 2012 Olympics unless they have a medical
reason to do so.  After the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics, blood-transfusion
equipment was found by workers cleaning a house where some
members of the Austrian Olympic team had stayed during the
Games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
