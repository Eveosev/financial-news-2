European Union Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  praised the Greek government’s
latest budget cuts while saying it’s too early to know whether
they are sufficient to secure the next aid tranche for Greece.  “Greece has taken important decisions in the past weeks,
also including yesterday,” Rehn told reporters today in
Luxembourg before a meeting of euro-area finance ministers. “We
are currently assessing whether Greece will meet its fiscal
targets with the current measures.”  The Greek government approved 6.6 billion euros ($8.8
billion) of austerity measures last night to narrow the 2012
deficit to 6.8 percent of gross domestic product, missing the
6.5 percent goal previously set with the EU,  International
Monetary Fund  and  European Central Bank . Finance Minister
Evangelos Venizelos had previously said Greece would miss the
targets and the EU, IMF and ECB accepted the new budget.  “Our teams are in  Athens ” and “the mission is ongoing
and working very actively in order to assess the impact of the
measures,” Rehn said.  Greece is seeking to qualify for a sixth disbursement of
aid under last year’s 110 billion-euro rescue from the euro area
and IMF. The next tranche totals 8 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
