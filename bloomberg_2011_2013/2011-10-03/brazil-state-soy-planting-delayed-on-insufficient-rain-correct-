(Corrects third paragraph to say Oct. 8.)  Soybean planting in  Brazil ’s Mato
Grosso state, the nation’s biggest producer of the oilseed, has
been delayed because of insufficient rain, weather forecaster
Somar Meteorologia said.  Some farmers who started planting, representing less than 1
percent of the crop, faced losses because of the dryness and
were forced to replant, Somar said today in an e-mailed report.  Although rain is expected in almost all producing regions
in coming days, it likely won’t be enough to allow planting to
start. Sufficient rain is expected after Oct. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
