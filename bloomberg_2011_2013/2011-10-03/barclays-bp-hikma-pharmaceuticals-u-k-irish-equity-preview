U.K. stocks fell, with the  FTSE 100
Index (UKX)  closing below 5,000 for the first time since July 2010, as
policy makers failed to reassure investors they can contain the
European debt crisis that threatens to curb economic growth.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  fell 7.6 percent, following losses in banking
shares across Europe, as Deutsche Bank AG abandoned its 2011
profit forecast. Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Europe’s largest oil
company, dropped 1.9 percent as crude retreated.  Rio Tinto  Group
declined 3.8 percent.  The benchmark FTSE 100 Index slid 131.06, or 2.6 percent,
to 4,944.44 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London, its fifth day of
declines. Earlier, it fell as much as 4.1 percent and
momentarily went 20 percent below its Feb. 8 peak. The FTSE All-
Share Index decreased 2.7 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ
Index retreated 3.6 percent.  “A failure to convince investors that funding pressures
can be alleviated through coordinated and concerted effort,
could result in further sharp falls,”  Peter Oppenheimer , an
equity strategist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in  London , wrote
in a report.  The FTSE 100 lost 14 percent in the third quarter, its
biggest drop since 2002, amid concern that Greece’s debt woes
will spread to other countries in the region and that the euro
area’s economy is stalling.  Greek Aid  Euro-area finance ministers meeting yesterday considered
“technical revisions” to the July deal for the second Greek
aid package, Luxembourg’s Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker 
said today, fueling concern bondholders may have to take bigger
losses on the nation’s debt.  Goldman Sachs cut its global growth forecast for this year
and next, predicting recessions in Germany and France as the
European economy stalls and the risk of a contraction in the
U.S. grows. The world economy will probably expand 3.8 percent
this year and 3.5 percent in 2012, compared with earlier
predictions of 3.9 percent for 2011 and 4.2 percent for next
year, Goldman Sachs economists Jan Hatzius and  Dominic Wilson 
wrote in an Oct. 3 report.  The sustained drop is dragging the FTSE 100 through
technical levels, said Lawrence Peterman, investment director at
Eden Financial Ltd. in London. “There is some support for the
FTSE 100 at 5,000. It’s interesting to see whether that level
holds today. I suspect it probably won’t.”  Banks Decline  Barclays, the U.K’s second-biggest bank by assets, lost 7.6
percent to 144.35 pence.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) 
retreated 4.2 percent to 21.52 pence. Financial shares fell as
Deutsche Bank cut its profit forecast for 2011 and the board of
 Dexia SA (DEXB)  asked the chief executive officer of Belgium’s largest
lender by assets to solve its “structural problems.”  Shell sank 1.9 percent to 1,928.5 pence.  BP Plc (BP/)  retreated
3.8 percent to 372 pence. Oil fell for a third day in  New York 
on signs of rising U.S. supplies and output from Libya.  Rio Tinto, the world’s second-largest mining company,
slumped 3.8 percent to 2,712.5 pence, the lowest price since
October 2009.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  slid 2.5 percent to 1,667 pence.  Copper fell for a fifth day in London on concern demand for
the metal may weaken as a worsening European sovereign-debt
crisis saps economies.  British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY)  dropped 2.7 percent to
639 pence after the European Union’s highest court said the
Premier League’s geographic restrictions on broadcasters
televising its soccer matches breach EU rules.  Tesco Plc (TSCO)  climbed 2.6 percent to 380.1 pence as UBS AG
upgraded the stock to “buy” from “neutral.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
