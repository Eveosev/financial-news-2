A U.K. gauge of new jobs weakened in
September as employment in banking fell to a record low,
recruitment company Reed said.  The Reed Job Index fell to 121 from 122 in August, the
London-based company said in a report today. A gauge for banks
fell to 75, the lowest since data began in December 2009, from
86 the previous month. A measure of salaries for new jobs held
at 97.  The hiring gauge for the public sector was at 57 in
September, the lowest of 24 categories in the Reed survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
