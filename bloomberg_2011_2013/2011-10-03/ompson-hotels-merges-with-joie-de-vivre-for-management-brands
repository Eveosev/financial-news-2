Thompson Hotels said it combined its
management and brands with Joie de Vivre Hospitality to form JT
Hospitality, an operator of 45 properties and revenue of about
$500 million a year.  Closely held Joie de Vivre and Thompson are equal partners
in the transaction, which took effect on Oct. 1, they said today
in a statement. The combined company will be based in  New York 
and Stephen Brandman, co-owner and chief executive officer of
Thompson, was named CEO of the newly formed firm. The deal
doesn’t include real estate.  Joie de Vivre is majority owned by John Pritzker’s San
Francisco-based Geolo Capital, a private-equity firm. He is the
son of the late billionaire Jay Pritzker, founder of  Hyatt
Hotels Corp. (H)  Geolo acquired its stake in Joie de Vivre last
year. Pritzker will be co-chairman with Jason Pomeranc, a
founder of Thompson.  JT Hospitality plans to expand its brands in the U.S. and
internationally through property-management contracts, joint
ventures and acquisitions, according to the statement.  The U.S. lodging industry has been improving after the
recession depressed demand in 2009 and 2010. Hotel occupancies
in the top 25 U.S. markets climbed to 65 percent in January
through May from 62 percent a year earlier, according to
Hendersonville, Tennessee-based Smith Travel Research Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
