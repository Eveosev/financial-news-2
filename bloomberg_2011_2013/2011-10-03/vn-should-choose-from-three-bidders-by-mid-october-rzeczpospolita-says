ITI Holdings SA, the majority owner
of  TVN SA (TVN) , should pick a buyer for Poland’s largest television
network by mid-October from three bidders, Rzeczpospolita
reported, quoting a person involved in the transation.  Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ,  Vivendi SA (VIV)  and  Germany ’s RTL Group SA are
all interested in acquiring ITI’s 56 percent stake in TVN, the
newspaper reported on its Rp.pl website.  ITI will probably make its choice after Poland’s Oct. 9
elections in order to better assess political risk from a change
of government and new leadership in the country’s competition
and financial-markets regulators, the person said, according to
Rzeczpospolita.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
