Thailand ’s baht fell to its weakest
level in more than a year after export growth moderated and the
nation’s current account swung to a deficit in August.  Overseas shipments, which account for about two-thirds of
 Southeast Asia ’s second-biggest economy, rose 28 percent from a
year earlier after having increased 36 percent in July, the
central bank said on Sept. 30. The current account, a broad
measure of trade, showed a shortfall of $697 million from a
surplus of $3.4 billion in July. The MSCI-Asia Pacific Index of
regional shares slid for a second day before European officials
meet today to discuss the threat of a Greek default.  “Sluggish economic conditions in developed nations are
hurting sentiment for Thailand that heavily depends on
exports,” said Tohru Nishihama, an economist at Dai-ichi Life
Research Institute Inc. in  Tokyo . “Investors have become risk
averse because there hasn’t been any fundamental solution to
 Europe ’s problems yet.”  The baht slumped 0.7 percent, the most in a week, to 31.31
per dollar as of 8:17 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 31.34 earlier, the weakest
level since Aug. 31, 2010. The currency lost 3.7 percent in
September, the biggest monthly decline since March 2001.  Global funds sold $542 million more Thai equities and $48
million more local government debt than they bought last month,
according to data from the stock exchange and the Thai Bond
Market Association.  Government bonds  were steady. The yield on the 5.25 percent
notes due May 2014 was 3.54 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
