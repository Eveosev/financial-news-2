Gulf Coast  gasoline and diesel rose
after  Pasadena  Refining System Inc., a unit of Petroleo
Brasileiro SA, shut its entire 106,500-barrel-a-day refinery in
Pasadena, Texas, after a fire.  The blaze started in the distillation section of the plant,
Ciro Ribeiro, a spokesman for the company, said in an e-mail on
Sept. 30. Ribeiro said he was checking on the status of the
plant today.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast strengthened 1.25 cents to 1.75 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange 11:16 a.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery slipped
0.13 cents to $2.5418 a gallon.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel versus heating oil
futures at the hub strengthened 0.87 cent to 3.25 cents a
gallon. Itâ€™s the highest premium since July 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
