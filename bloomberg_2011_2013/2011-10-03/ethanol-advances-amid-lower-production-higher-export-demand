Ethanol futures advanced in  Chicago 
amid lower production and higher demand for U.S. exports.  Futures rose after a Sept. 29 Energy Department report
showed  exports  of the biofuel averaged 98,000 barrels a day in
July, the highest amount since the U.S. began tracking the data
in 2010. That comes as production averaged 841,000 barrels a day
in the most recent report, the lowest level in a year.  “Word on the street is that supply is tight in a couple
key areas,” said Justin Dirico, senior ethanol trader at SCB &
Associates LLC in Chicago. “Production’s down a little bit.
It’s a short-term situation.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery climbed 1.5 cents,
or 0.6 percent, to $2.50 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 31 percent in the past year.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast plummeted
14 cents, or 5.1 percent, to $2.61 a gallon and in  New York  the
biofuel sank 13 cents, or 4.8 percent, to $2.585, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf declined 10 cents, or 3.8 percent,
to $2.505 a gallon and in Chicago the additive fell 7 cents, or
2.8 percent, to $2.48.  To contact the reporter on this story:
