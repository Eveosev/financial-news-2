U.S. Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta 
said securing peace between Israelis and Palestinians will
require “bold action” and there is “no alternative” to
negotiations.  Panetta, who met with Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak
today in  Tel Aviv , also said the Obama administration opposes
withholding funds from the Palestinian Authority to retaliate
for their decision to seek statehood recognition at the  United
Nations . U.S. officials have vowed to veto the proposal.  “Security is dependent on a strong military, but it is
also dependent on strong diplomacy,” Panetta said. “I want to
emphasize that there is a need and an opportunity for bold
action on both sides to move towards a negotiated two-state
solution.”  The U.S. and its international partners are trying to
arrange new Middle East talks aimed at reaching a peace
agreement that would precede recognition of a Palestinian state
and membership in the UN. Panetta was scheduled to meet with
both  Palestinian Authority  President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later today.  Barak said that Israel must try to ease strains that have
developed with both Egypt and Turkey, as well as with the
Palestinians.  “We have to look for any reasonable and proper way to
reduce tensions,” Barak said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
