Luxembourg Finance Minister Luc Frieden said “all options” are on the table regarding  Dexia SA (DEXB) 
and that France, Belgium and Luxembourg will do what is needed
for the bank.  “I can assure you that the governments of the three
countries will take whatever steps are necessary to make sure
that the clients and the employees of Dexia can have trust in
that bank, as we did in 2008,” Frieden said in an interview
with Bloomberg Television today in Luxembourg. “All options are
on the table in a constructive manner to make sure that the bank
in whole or in part will remain a very serious financial
institution.”  Frieden said re-introducing government guarantees on
Dexia’s senior debt “is not the preferred route for the
Luxembourg government.” He said officials will do “whatever it
takes, because it’s a systemic bank, for Dexia, like for any
other banks, to make sure that these banks in an environment
which is complicated will remain a trustworthy and stable
bank.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
