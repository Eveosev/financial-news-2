Northill Capital LLP is providing
financial backing to Goldbridge Capital Partners, a new European
credit fund and distressed debt investor.  Goldbridge will buy the debt of companies trading at
distressed levels and high-yield bonds. It has $100 million of
equity and seed capital, according to a  statement  from Northill,
a London-based investment firm founded by former BNY Mellon
Asset Management Vice Chairman Jon Little.  “The current credit market crisis combined with the need
for European banks to delever will lead to a significant number
of new high-yield and distressed investing possibilities as
businesses restructure,” Northill said in the statement.
“Goldbridge will seek to profit from the opportunity presented
by the refinancing glut.”  Gina Germano, formerly a portfolio manager at BlueBay Asset
Management Ltd. and Dipankar Shewaram, the head of non-U.S.
credit at Western Asset Management, founded Goldbridge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
