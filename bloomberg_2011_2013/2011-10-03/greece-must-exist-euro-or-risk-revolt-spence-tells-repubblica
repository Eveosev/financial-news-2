Greece  risks a violent revolution
unless it leaves the euro in an “orderly exit” organized by
the European Central Bank and the European Union, Nobel Prize-
winning economist  Michael Spence  told la Repubblica newspaper.  Greece’s plans to scrap as many as 30,000 public-sector
jobs, coupled with other austerity moves, are “unsustainable”
and mean the country “risks being torched” by people “in a
long agony,” New York University professor Spence, who won the
Nobel in  2001 , told the daily in an interview published today.  The only solution is an orderly exit from the euro that
allows Greece to lower costs and regain competitiveness, Spence
was  quoted  as saying. Such a scenario wouldn’t spark the kind of
chain reaction the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. did
in 2008 because it would be orchestrated by the ECB and the EU,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
