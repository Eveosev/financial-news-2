The Czech central state budget
deficit widened from a year ago to 78 percent of the full-year
plan in the January-September period as revenue declined.  The central state budget, the biggest part of public
finances that serve as the fiscal yardstick for assessing a
European Union member’s readiness to adopt the euro, had a
shortfall of 105.1 billion koruna ($5.6 billion) in the first
nine months of the year, more than the 99.6 billion-koruna gap
in the same period of 2010.  Revenue totaled 741.9 billion koruna, 4.1 billion koruna
less than a year ago. Expenditure was 847 billion koruna,
compared with 845.5 billion koruna. The government’s plan to
narrow the public-finance deficit to less than the EU’s limit of
3 percent of economic output by 2013 has helped Czech five-year
bonds outperform German debt with a similar maturity in the past
year.  The government plans to narrow the overall fiscal gap to
3.5 percent of gross domestic product in 2012, from a planned
4.2 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
