Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis’s Unity party called for a coalition government
consisting of all five parties that were elected to parliament,
the  Baltic News Service  reported.  The groups should consider a “rainbow coalition” as a way
forward since a government has yet to be formed, Dombrovskis
said, according to the Riga-based newswire.  Former President Valdis Zatlers’s Reform Party on Oct. 1
invited Unity to join it in a coalition with Harmony Center,
which appeals to the country’s Russian minority. Unity had
preferred a three-party government with the  National Alliance , a
nationalist party whose policies include bolstering use of the
Latvian language in schools.  To contact the reporter on this story:
