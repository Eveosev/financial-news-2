Georgia will continue negotiations
with  Russia  this week over joining the World Trade Organization,
a Georgian deputy foreign minister said.  Talks will be held in Geneva on Oct. 7, Davit Jalagania
told reporters today in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi. They will
be led by Sergi Kapanadze, another deputy foreign minister, and
Tamara Kovziridze, an adviser to Prime Minister Nika Gilauri, he
added.  Switzerland has mediated in WTO negotiations between
Georgia and Russia, which fought a five-day war in 2008. Russia,
the largest economy outside the world trade arbiter, has been
trying to join the organization since 1993, surpassing the 15
years  China  had to wait before becoming a member. While the U.S.
and the European Union back Russiaâ€™s entry, its southern
neighbor  Georgia , already a member, has blocked its accession.  Georgia failed to reach an agreement with Russia over the
WTO during talks in Geneva last month, Foreign Minister Grigol
Vashadze said Sept. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
