The  London  Metal Exchange board
approved a third-party review to prove warehouses and trading
companies are keeping their operations separate,  Martin Abbott ,
chief executive officer of the exchange, said.  “We are proceeding as we said with the introduction of the
third-party audit,” he said in an interview in London today.  The change will take effect April 1, Diarmuid O’Hegarty,
deputy CEO of the exchange, said. “We still have to give a
notice period to the warehouse companies.” New rents usually
take effect every April 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
