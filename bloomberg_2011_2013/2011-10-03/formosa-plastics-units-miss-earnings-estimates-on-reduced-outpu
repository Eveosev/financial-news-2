The four biggest units of  Formosa
Plastics Group ,  Taiwan ’s largest diversified company, reported
third-quarter pretax earnings that missed analyst estimates
after accidents reduced output.  Oil refiner  Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (6505)  posted a loss of
NT$1.42 billion ($46 million) in the three months ended Sept.
30, its parent said in a statement today. The average of four
estimates compiled by Bloomberg was for a NT$14.8 billion
profit. Polyvinyl chloride maker  Formosa Plastics Corp. (1301) ’s pretax
profit of NT$9.91 billion trailed the NT$16 billion average
forecast of five analysts.  Formosa Petrochemical halted its 540,000 barrel-a-day
Mailiao refinery after a fire on July 30, which resulted in a 30
percent drop in sales in August from a year earlier. Group
members including  Nan Ya Plastics Corp. (1303)  had also shut some
production lines after a blaze in May.  “Formosa Petrochemical hardly had any output in August,”
said Danny Ho, a Taipei-based analyst at Yuanta Securities Co.,
who has a “hold” rating on the refiner.  Nan Ya Plastics posted a NT$6.44 billion pretax profit,
missing the NT$12.4 billion average of five estimates. Chemical
producer  Formosa Chemicals & Fibre Corp. (1326)  reported a pretax
profit of NT$7.56 billion, less than half the NT$16.1 billion
average of eight estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Formosa Plastics fell 5.4 percent to close at NT$77.3
before the earnings announcement. Nan Ya Plastics dropped 0.9
percent to NT$65.7, Formosa Chemicals declined 1.8 percent to
NT$78.2, while Formosa Petrochemical ended the day 3.8 percent
lower at NT$80.70. The benchmark Taiex Index fell 2.9 percent.  ‘Outlook Worrying’  Formosa Chemicals President Hong Fu-yuan and Nan Ya
President Wu Chia-chau told reporters at a media briefing today
that the two companies have yet to resume output at some plants.  China’s monetary tightening also hurts earnings, Hong said.
“The outlook is worrying,” he said.  The central bank of  China , Taiwan’s biggest export market,
has raised  interest rates  three times this year and ordered
lenders to set aside a bigger portion of their deposits to curb
inflation running near a three-year high.  Formosa Plastics Group controls more than 100 companies and
organizations such as hospitals and schools. The group has sales
of NT$2.19 trillion last year and employed about 99,300 people,
according to its website.  To contact the reporter on the story:
