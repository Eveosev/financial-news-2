Cia. Energetica de  Minas Gerais , a
Brazilian state-controlled electricity utility, fell the most in
more than a week on concern it plans to buy a stake in the Belo
Monte dam being constructed in  Brazil ’s Para state.  Cemig, as the company is known, fell 1.5 percent to 27.31
reais at 12:48 p.m. New York time, after earlier dropping as
much as 2 percent, the steepest intraday decline since Sept. 23.  Cemig is in talks to buy a 10 percent stake in Belo Monte
from the companies building the facility, Folha de S.Paulo
reported Oct. 1, citing an unidentified person familiar with the
matter. Cemig would buy 5 percent directly and 5 percent
indirectly, through  Light SA (LIGT3) , in which it has a controlling
stake, the newspaper reported.  “We see this investment as negative,” said Fabio
Frischer, analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG in an e-mailed
report to clients today. “We think it’ll have a bigger negative
impact on Light than on Cemig, given the difference in size
between them.”  An official at Cemig who asked not to be identified in
accordance with company policy declined to comment on the Folha
report.  Light dropped 1.3 percent to 24.49 reais, the lowest in six
weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
