The French and Belgian governments
are ready to back their country’s banks in case of need,
including  Dexia SA (DEXB) , Belgian Finance Minister  Didier Reynders 
said.  “France and  Belgium  are ready to support their banks,”
Reynders told reporters in Luxembourg. Dexia wasn’t one of the
banks that regulators raised concerns about following European
Union stress tests earlier this year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
