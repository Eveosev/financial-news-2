The Philippines’ Court of Appeals
affirmed a lower court decision that prevented the government
from imposing value-added tax on Philippine Airlines Inc.’s fuel
imports.  The appellate court ruled that the Pasay City regional
trial court did not commit grave abuse of discretion when it
issued an order stopping the Department of Finance from
collecting value-added tax on the carrier’s imported fuels, it
said in a decision promulgated on Sept. 21 and released to the
media today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
