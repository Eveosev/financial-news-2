Borrowers issued the fewest bonds in
 Australia  in almost three years last quarter as  Europe ’s budget
crisis roiled markets, driving up yield premiums, while the
nation’s banks used record term deposits to cut debt offerings.  Sales in the three months to Sept. 30 were A$16.5 billion
($15.7 billion), down from A$26.4 billion in the prior period
and the slowest pace since the fourth quarter of 2008, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. U.S. investment-grade offerings
of $168.8 billion were the least since the second quarter of
2010 and Australia’s four biggest lenders sold the smallest
amount since 2007.  Banks cut debt offerings at home and abroad as households
save the most ever in fixed-term deposits, avoiding stocks as
the Australian All Ordinaries Index of equities heads for its
first back-to-back yearly loss since 1982 on concern European
and U.S. fiscal crises will disrupt global growth. The extra
yield investors demand over  government securities  to hold
Australian corporate debt surged 64 basis points last quarter to
241 basis points, as global premiums jumped 101 to 264, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes show.  “Investors are nervous about how to price risk in such a
volatile market,” said  John Sorrell , head of credit at Tyndall
Investment Management Australia Ltd. in Sydney, which manages
about A$14 billion of fixed-income assets. “Issuers seem
unwilling to pay the price or in the case of the banks have
managed their funding requirements so they can afford to wait
until markets calm down.”  Bank Sales Shrink  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA)  and  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) 
sold A$3.6 billion of notes in their home market, while
 Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  and  National
Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  issued none, as offerings by the nation’s
four biggest lenders shrank 54 percent from the second quarter.  Commonwealth Bank topped the arranger rankings with a 27
percent market share, followed by ANZ Bank and Westpac, the data
show. If self-led deals are excluded, ANZ Bank takes the top
spot, with UBS AG in second and Westpac in third.  Australian households, lured by the developed world’s
highest benchmark interest rate, held a record A$469.5 billion
in term deposits in July, central bank data show. The deposits
were the most relative to offshore bank debt in data going back
to 1984. Westpac was paying 5.6 percent interest on one-year
deposits of A$5,000 and over, while Commonwealth offers 5.3
percent for accounts with at least A$10,000, the banks’ websites
showed last week.  Ralph Norris, chief executive officer of Commonwealth Bank,
said in Sydney on Sept. 26 that the lender was so well funded it
wouldn’t have to raise financing in wholesale debt markets until
next year.  The nation’s four largest banks sold $5.5 billion of U.S.
dollar-denominated bonds in the three months to Sept. 30, down
70 percent from the prior quarter and 39 percent from the same
period a year earlier, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Premium Drops  That’s helped push the premium that banks pay to switch
U.S. bond sale proceeds into their home currency through basis
swaps to the lowest level since 2009, reducing the discount for
sellers of so-called kangaroo bonds seeking to perform the
opposite transaction.  Sales of bonds by foreign issuers in Australia totaled
A$5.7 billion for the quarter, the least since the second
quarter of 2010, Bloomberg data show.  The five-year Australian dollar basis swap, which measures
the cost of switching interest based on the London interbank
offered rate for payments linked to Australia’s bank bill swap
rate, was at 8.25 basis points today, after falling to 5.3 on
Sept. 14, the lowest close since January 2009.  Kangaroo Sales  “The major banks have scaled back their offshore funding
in recent months, which has the knock-on effect of lowering
basis swap levels, making the Australian market less attractive
for kangaroo issuers,” said James Holian, a director of
syndicate at ANZ Bank. “A key unknown for issuers and investors
is where spreads will settle when the markets are calmer, and
many investors are monitoring how the European crisis plays out
before putting their cash to work.”  Citigroup Inc. and UBS have cut forecasts for global growth
as the sovereign crisis that began in  Greece  spreads to larger
European economies and threatens the region’s common currency.  Greece’s government approved 6.6 billion euros ($8.7
billion) of austerity measures including firing state workers,
to show it can trim its  budget deficit  enough to secure a
pending aid payment and a second rescue package.  Bond Yields  Australia’s 10-year government bond yield has plunged for
nine straight months amid the turmoil. The security yielded 4.05
percent as of 12:47 p.m. in Sydney, or 228 basis points more
than Treasuries.  The so-called Aussie dollar, the world’s fifth-most traded
currency, dropped for the first quarter since the three months
ended June 30, 2010,  closing at 96.62 U.S. cents on Sept. 30
from $1.0722 at the start of the period. The currency reached
$1.1081 on July 27, the strongest since it was freely floated in
1983, and was at 95.32 U.S. cents in Sydney today.  The gap between yields on Australian  government bonds  and
inflation-indexed notes shows investors estimate consumer-price
gains to average 2.38 percent for the next five years, down from
2011’s peak of 3.14 percent on May 6.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index of credit-default swaps
surged 104 basis points since June 30 to 217 basis points on
Sept. 30, CMA prices show. Swaps on the Australian sovereign
jumped 45 basis points to 102, while U.S. contracts rose to 52
from 50.6, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc.
and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  Bond Risk  Debt sales in Australia plummeted to A$12.8 billion in the
fourth quarter of 2008 in the wake of the Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. collapse, as the corporate bond risk gauge surged
142 basis points to 342 on Dec. 31 of that year. Offerings
rebounded to A$25.1 billion the following quarter, helped by a
government guarantee on bank bonds.  “I would expect a natural return of issuance once markets
normalize, as issuers resume their funding activities,” said
Gus Medeiros, a director of credit research and strategy at
Deutsche Bank AG in Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
