Gasoline fell on concern that
 Greece ’s debt crisis will spread, curtailing fuel demand in
 Europe  and threatening the global economy.  Futures declined as European officials prepared to consider
how to shield banks from the debt crisis and boost the region’s
rescue fund after Greece missed a deficit target for 2012.
Europe’s manufacturing industry contracted for a second month in
September, adding to signs the euro-area economy is edging
toward a recession.  “If Greece defaults, what’s the effect on French and
German banks and other Europeans countries having trouble with
their own debt?” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “There’s also signs
that the  U.S. economy  is sputtering.”  Gasoline for November delivery fell 2.71 cents, or 1.1
percent, to settle at $2.511 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Prices touched $2.4925. Futures fell 13 percent in
September and in the third quarter.  Gasoline’s drop coincides with a broader decline in
equities and commodities and a surge in the dollar, which
reduces the investment appeal of commodities. Crude oil on the
Nymex fell $1.59 to $77.61, the lowest since Sept. 28, 2010.
Brent oil for November settlement lost $1.05 to $101.71 a barrel
on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  S&P GSCI  The S&P GSCI Index of 24 raw materials lost 0.9 percent and
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of stocks fell 2.9 percent to
below 1,100 for the first time in more than a year. The U.S.
currency advanced 1.6 percent against the euro.  “All these markets are so intertwined now and there’s
concerns about the future performance by the global economy,”
said Mark Anderle, a trader at Truman Arnold Cos. in  Dallas .
“The trend remains down.”  A manufacturing gauge based on a survey of purchasing
managers in the 17-nation euro region fell to 48.5 from 49 in
August, London-based Markit Economics said today.  Futures pared losses after a report that U.S. factory
output rose in September. The Institute for Supply Management’s
factory index increased to 51.6 from 50.6 the prior month, the
Tempe, Arizona-based group said today. A reading above 50
indicates expansion.  Projected Drop  Economists projected the gauge would drop to 50.5,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  November gasoline traded at a 4.78-cent premium to December
futures on speculation the refinery shutdowns will crimp
supplies in the short term.  ConocoPhillips stopped production of its 190,000-barrel-a-
day refinery in Trainer,  Pennsylvania , on Sept. 30, saying it
would shutter the plant permanently within six months if it
can’t sell it. A 106,500-barrel-a-day refinery in  Pasadena ,
 Texas , owned by a unit of Petroleo Brasileiro SA, was shut on
Sept. 30 after a fire at a crude unit.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc shut its 500,000-barrel-a-day
refinery in  Singapore  in Sept. 28 after a fire and today
declared force majeure, exempting it from future contracts.  “Trainer just shut down, Lyondell shut and Shell Singapore
took half a million barrels a day out of the market, and that
has the spread popping,” Anderle said.  Heating oil for November delivery fell 2.64 cents, or 1
percent, to settle at $2.7529 a gallon, after touching $2.7436.
Futures lost 9.2 percent last month, the biggest drop since May
2010, and declined 4.7 percent in the third quarter.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, slipped
0.7 cent to $3.417 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.
It’s the lowest level since March 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
