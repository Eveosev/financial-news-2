House Majority Leader  Eric Cantor 
said the chamber plans to vote next week on free-trade deals
with Colombia, Panama and South Korea that President Barack Obama formally submitted to Congress today for ratification.  “It is expected the House will pass those agreements next
week,” Cantor, a Virginia Republican said in a statement.  A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio
Republican, called passage of the deals a “top priority.”  The Senate also will act this month on the proposed trade
agreements, said Majority Leader  Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
