(Corrects combined annual output figure for Silangan and
Bulawan mines in second paragraph.)  Philex Mining Corp. (PX)  is scouting for
projects to boost its gold production to one million ounces
annually in the next three to five years, Vice President for
Business Development Denis Ricardo Lucindo told reporters in
 Manila  today.  Philex’s Padcal mine is producing about 130,000 ounces a
year, while the Silangan and Bulawan mines may have a combined
annual output of 300,000 ounces annually, Lucindo said.  “We’re looking at 570,000 ounces” more, Lucindo said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
