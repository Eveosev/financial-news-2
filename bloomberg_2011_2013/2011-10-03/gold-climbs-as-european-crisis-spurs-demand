Gold futures rose for the second
straight session on concern that  Greece  will default on its
debt, spurring demand for the metal as a haven. Silver climbed.  Today was the original target date for approving an 8
billion-euro ($10.7 billion) loan payment to Greece, the sixth
installment of the 110 billion-euro lifeline assembled in May
2010. That decision was pushed back until mid-October. In
September, gold tumbled 11 percent, the most since October 2008,
as financial turmoil in  Europe  prompted sales of the metal to
cover losses in other markets.  “The selling is exhausted, and gold is back to trading
more like a currency again,” James Dailey, who manages $215
million at TEAM Financial Management LLC in Harrisburg,
 Pennsylvania , said in an e-mail. “The potential for a
controlled default in Greece appears to be increasing.”  Gold futures for delivery in December jumped $35.40, or 2.2
percent, to settle at $1,657.70 an ounce at 1:51 p.m. on the
Comex in  New York . The metal gained 0.3 percent on Sept. 30. The
price has climbed 17 percent this year, reaching a record
$1,923.70 on Sept. 6.  On Sept. 30, holdings in gold-backed exchange-traded
products rose 0.2 percent, the first increase in a week, to
2,213.6 metric tons, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We expect physical demand to be quite decent in the
coming days,”  Edel Tully , an analyst at UBS AG in London, said
in a report. “After the recent washout, gold positioning is far
from extended, and this is quite a bullish signal for price
strength ahead.”  Silver futures for December delivery jumped 71.2 cents, or
2.4 percent, to $30.795 an ounce on the Comex. In the third
quarter, the metal tumbled 14 percent, the most in three years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
