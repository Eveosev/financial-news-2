British Airways plans to offer
members of its Executive Club frequent flier program the chance
to exchange their air miles for a course on air-travel safety.  For a price similar to that of a return flight within
 Europe , Executive Club members will be able to enroll in the
one-day course that educates passengers on aspects of in-flight
and “wider travel safety issues,” said Richard Gooding, a
British Airways spokesman.  “We’ve offered the course for five or six years as part of
our overall account management with our big corporate clients,”
Goodfellow said by telephone. “We’re now looking to offer this
to a wider audience.”  The course was started for BP Plc, Europe’s second-biggest
oil company, to train its executives, and has been used by
companies in team-building exercises.  British Airways is a unit of International Consolidated
Airlines Group SA.
