The U.S. Supreme Court let stand a
ruling that limits the royalties Internet companies including
Yahoo! Inc. and  RealNetworks Inc. (RNWK)  must pay to songwriters on
downloaded music.  The justices today turned away an appeal by the American
Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, or ASCAP, which
licenses about 45 percent of the musical works played online.  ASCAP sought to overturn a ruling that the group said in
court papers would cost its 295,000 members tens of millions of
dollars a year.  A federal appeals court in  New York  ruled that the
downloading of a musical work isn’t a “public performance”
covered under the U.S. copyright laws. That reasoning meant
ASCAP couldn’t seek compensation on behalf of its members for
the act of downloading, though copyright owners can still demand
royalties for the new copies of a song that are created.  The dispute landed in court after ASCAP couldn’t reach
licensing agreements with Yahoo and RealNetworks. ASCAP then
invoked a procedure set up decades ago under a settlement with
the  Justice Department , asking a federal judge in Manhattan to
determine what licensing fees would be reasonable.  The case is American Society of Composers, Authors and
Publishers v. United States, 10-1337.  To contact the reporter on this story:
