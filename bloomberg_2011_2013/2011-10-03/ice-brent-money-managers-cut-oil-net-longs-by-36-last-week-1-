Hedge funds  and other money managers
raised bullish bets on  Brent crude  by 41 percent in the week
ended Oct. 11, according to  data from ICE Futures Europe.   Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 41,004
contracts, the London-based exchange said today in its weekly
Commitment of Traders report. Net-long positions climbed by
11,911 contracts, from 29,093 a week earlier.  Bearish bets by producers, merchants, processors and users
on Brent crude outnumbered bullish positions by 49,400 lots.
Their net-short positions were 33,290 contracts more than the
previous week.  Swaps dealers were net-long 32,785 Brent contracts. That’s
17,718 lots, or 35 percent, lower than the week earlier.  Net long managed-money bets on gasoil futures and options
increased to 30,434 contracts last week. That’s an advance of
25,342 lots or 20 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
