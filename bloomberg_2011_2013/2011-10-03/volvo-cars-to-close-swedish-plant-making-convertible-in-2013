Volvo Car Corp., the Swedish
automaker owned by  China ’s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co.,
said it will close its plant in Uddevalla,  Sweden , in 2013
because of insufficient volumes.  Volvo is making the C70 convertible at the plant, which is
co-owned with Italian car design company  Pininfarina SpA. (PINF)  The
factory produced 10,000 cars last year and is now working at 65
percent of its capacity, Volvo said.  “The low volumes in the Uddevalla plant do not justify
continued production,” Chief Executive Officer  Stefan Jacoby 
said in a  statement  on the company’s website. “A car
manufacturer of Volvo’s size cannot, from a financial
standpoint, justify a plant that manufactures one single model
in the low volumes we have today.”  Volvo, based in Gothenburg, Sweden, aims to more than
double annual sales to 800,000 cars by 2020. It plans to invest
as much as $11 billion over the next five years to meet demand
in markets including China. Volvo was sold by  Ford Motor Co. (F) 
last year to Zhejiang Geely for about $1.5 billion.  The 600 workers at the plant will be offered jobs at other
Volvo plants, including the main factory in Gothenburg, the
company said.  Volvo and Pininfarina agreed in March to end their joint
venture.  Volvo will buy out Pininfarina in 2013 and then close
the factory, it said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
