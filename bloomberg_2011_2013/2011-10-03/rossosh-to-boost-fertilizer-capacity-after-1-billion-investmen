OAO Minudobreniya , the Russian
fertilizer producer acquired by Arkady Rotenberg for $1 billion,
plans to increase capacity as demand for crop nutrients grows.  The company, known as Rossosh, will add 500,000 metric tons
of urea production capacity and may boost ammonia output by 50
percent to 1.5 million tons, Rotenberg’s press office said today
in an e-mailed statement, without giving a timeframe.  Rotenberg, part-owner of Russian builder OAO Mostotrest and
a judo partner of Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin , bought Rossosh
in July as rising global food prices spurred crop-plantings and
drove up fertilizer demand. Rotenberg also controls OOO
Stroygazmontazh, a supplier of pipes to gas company OAO Gazprom.  Ammonia production at Rossosh may double in the “longer
term” and urea volumes expand to 3 million tons, the press
office said, citing comments from Rotenberg last week. Ammonia
compounds are used to produce nitrogen fertilizers.  Rossosh, based in the central Russian city of the same
name, sold 1.12 million tons of complex fertilizers last year.
It sold 590,000 tons of ammonia and 538,000 tons of ammonium
nitrate, and reported revenue of 18.9 billion rubles ($581
million), according to the company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
