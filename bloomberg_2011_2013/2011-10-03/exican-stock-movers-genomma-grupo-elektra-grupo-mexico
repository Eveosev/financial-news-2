The following companies had unusual
price changes in  Mexico  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. New York time.  The IPC index fell 1.1 percent to 33,133.88.  Cemex SAB (CEMEXCPO), the largest cement maker in the
Americas, plunged 16.2 percent to 3.72 pesos, its biggest drop
since Dec. 11, 2008, amid concern slower global economic growth
may keep the company from meeting its debt targets and lead it
to renegotiate covenants with banks. The drop prompted a
temporary halt in trading before Cemex filed a statement to the
Mexican stock exchange saying it had nothing to disclose.  Grupo Elektra SAB (ELEKTRA* MM), the retail and banking
company controlled by billionaire  Ricardo Salinas , fell 5.1
percent to 1,004.45 pesos amid mounting concern there will be a
world economic slowdown. European leaders met to discuss
increasing the regionâ€™s rescue fund and weigh the risk of a
Greek default.  Genomma Lab Internacional SAB de CV (LABB MM), the Mexican
producer of over-the-counter drugs, added 0.1 percent to 23.20
pesos. The company said in a statement that it acquired a
package of brands for Mexico from Colgate-Palmolive Co.,
including Wildroot, Alert and Nordiko.  To contact the reporter on this story:
