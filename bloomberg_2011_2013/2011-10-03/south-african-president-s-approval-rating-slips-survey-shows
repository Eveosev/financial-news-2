 South African President  Jacob Zuma ’s
approval rating slipped after clashes with the leadership of the
ruling party’s youth wing, which is calling for the seizure of
mines and banks, a survey released today showed.  Of 2,000 adults canvassed by Johannesburg-based research
company TNS between Aug. 25 and Sept. 12, just 45 percent said
Zuma was doing a good job, down from 48 percent in March. Forty-
one percent of respondents disapproved of Zuma’s performance, up
from 38 percent. The survey, conducted in the seven main cities,
had a margin of error of less than 2.5 percent, TNS said.  The African National Congress Youth League, led by  Julius Malema , has threatened to oust party leaders who fail to back
its nationalization call. Last month, the ANC instituted
disciplinary action against Malema and four other league
officials, accusing them of sowing divisions within party ranks.
Malema was getting out of control and needed to be reined in,
Zuma said an address in Johannesburg today.  “This is a very public disagreement between two very high-
profile leaders,” Neill Higgs, a TNS analyst, said by
telephone. “It’s not helping either of them.”  Zuma, who has been in power since May 2009, has said he is
available to serve a second term as ANC president when it holds
leadership elections in December 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
