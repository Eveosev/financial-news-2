European Central Bank Executive Board
member Lorenzo  Bini Smaghi  said a more flexible international
monetary system does not prevent the emergence of global
imbalances and crises.  “There is no credible mechanism for symmetric adjustment
of imbalances at work today, even though we now have more
flexible exchange rates, more financial innovation, more capital
mobility and more private international liquidity,” Bini Smaghi
said, according to the e-mailed text of a speech delivered at a
conference in Brussels today.  Bini Smaghi also said that “key issuers and holders of
reserve currencies pursue domestic objectives independently of
what would best serve the global system and even their longer-
run interest.” They tend to “produce unsustainable imbalances
and fuel vulnerability in the global financial system” as well
as a global liquidity glut, he said.  Policy makers around the globe are seeking ways to prevent
 Europe ’s debt crisis from pushing the global economy into
recession. Stocks fell today, extending losses from the worst
quarterly retreat in almost three years.  Even coordinated global policies are not enough to
strengthen resilience “and crises do play a part in producing
fundamental changes in the system of policy incentives,” Bini
Smaghi said. “For instance, it was not until the euro area
sovereign-debt crisis that” member countries’ economic
governance “started to be seriously enhanced –- and the list of
examples is of course very long.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
