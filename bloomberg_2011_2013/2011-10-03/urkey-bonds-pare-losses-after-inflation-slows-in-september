Turkish bonds pared losses after
inflation slowed less than expected in September.  Yields on the two-year benchmark bond were unchanged at
8.41 percent at 10:05 a.m. in Istanbul, after rising by as much
as 7 basis points to 8.48 percent before the inflation data,
according to the RBS Istanbul Benchmark Bond Index. The lira
weakened 0.4 percent to 1.8667.  The inflation rate fell to 6.15 percent from 6.7 percent in
August, the statistics office in Ankara said on its website
today. The median estimate of eight economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was 6 percent. In the month, prices rose 0.75 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
