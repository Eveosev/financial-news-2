Global inflationary pressure is
easing as the world economic recovery slows,  Taiwan ’s central
bank said in a report released today, which Governor Perng Fai-
nan will present to parliament on Oct. 5.  Demand for the U.S. dollar has contributed to a decline in
Asian currencies, the central bank said, while reiterating it
will step into the market to curb irregular swings in the Taiwan
dollar. Taiwan’s real-estate market has cooled since June, the
central bank also said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
