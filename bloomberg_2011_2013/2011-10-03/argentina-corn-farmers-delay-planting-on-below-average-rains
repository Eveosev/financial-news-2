Corn farmers in Argentina, the
world’s second-largest exporter, will probably delay planting
until at least November after a month of below-average rainfall,
according to the  Buenos Aires  Cereals Exchange.  Forecasters are expecting above-average precipitation this
month and farmers will wait for soil moisture to return before
they accelerate planting, Maximiliano Zavala, an agronomist at
the exchange, said in a phone interview from Buenos Aires today.  Most farmers likely won’t plant corn this month to avoid
flowering in December and January, which are expected to be dry
because of the La Nina weather pattern, Zavala said. Dry weather
curbs flowering and cuts production. Last month’s lack of rain
across the main growing areas hurt corn and wheat crops,
according to exchange and Agriculture Ministry reports.  “Most climatologists are forecasting that October and the
beginning of November will be more rainy,” Zavala said.
“Farmers are waiting for those October rains to build up soil
moisture” to sow the land in November and December, he said.  Argentina ’s corn crop is 7.7 percent planted, the exchange
said on Sept. 29. The corn crop is planted through December and
harvested between February and August.  Corn futures for December delivery rose 4.25 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $5.9675 a bushel at 12:13 p.m. New York time on the
Chicago Board of Trade.  The U.S. is the world’s biggest corn producer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
