RTS futures fell, signaling the
measure in Moscow may extend declines from a 15-month low, as a
gauge showed Russian manufacturing stagnated in September,
sending shares of OAO  Mechel (MTL)  lower amid concern the world’s
largest energy-exporting economy will continue to slow.  Futures on the dollar-denominated index expiring in
December lost 1.3 percent to 126,880 yesterday, as the RTS Index
in Moscow dropped 3.7 percent to 1,291.70, the lowest level
since July 1, 2010, and the 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  fell 1.6
percent to 1,344.66, a six-day low. All companies on the
Bloomberg Russia-US 14 Index fell as the benchmark slid 3.9
percent to 82.41, the lowest level since Aug. 26, 2010. The
Micex may drop 1.5 percent at the start of trading today,
according to  Alfa Bank .  Manufacturers face “lasting stagnation” as external
demand weakens, said  Alexander Morozov , HSBC’s chief economist
in Moscow. American depositary receipts of Mechel,  Russia ’s
largest producer of coal for steelmakers, extended a four-day
drop to 24 percent as Greece missed a deficit target for 2012.
The Moscow-based producer got about 19 percent of 2010 sales
from  Europe , Russia’s largest trading partner.  “There’s real concern about manufacturing trends globally,
and with Europe such a mess, the next headline is Europe is
going into a recession,” Alec Young, an international equity
strategist at Standard & Poor’s in New York, said in a phone
interview yesterday. “With Russia, it’s a high stakes decision
because prices can move three to four percent in a day. In this
environment, you’re not going to get burned worse in many places
than Russia.”  Biggest Export Earner  The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in
the index futures, jumped for a third day, gaining 13 percent to
66.99 points, the biggest one-day advance since a 36 percent
surge on Sept. 22.  Oil, Russia’s biggest export earner, fell to the lowest
price in more than a year on concern  Greece  will default on its
debt payments. Crude for November delivery dropped 2 percent to
settle at $77.61 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
the lowest settlement level since Sept. 28, 2010.  Urals crude, the nation’s chief export oil blend, fell 1.6
percent to $99.29, the lowest level since Feb. 15. Oil and
natural gas contribute about 17 percent of Russia’s gross
domestic product and as much as 40 percent of budget revenue.  Russia’s gross domestic product rose 3.4 percent in the
second quarter, the slowest economic growth since 2009,
according to government data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 2.8 percent to
1,099.23, a one-year low, even as a gauge showed U.S.
manufacturing unexpectedly accelerated in September. The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  lost 2.4 percent to 10,655.30.  Sberbank, Gazprom  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index climbed
to 51.6 last month from 50.6 in August, the Tempe, Arizona-based
group said today. A level of 50 is the dividing line between
growth and contraction. The median forecast of 82 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a drop to 50.5.  OAO  Mechel (MTLR)  fell for a fourth trading day, slumping 9.5
percent to $9.22, the lowest level since July 2009, after losing
5.3 percent in Moscow to close at 320.30 rubles, the equivalent
of $9.78.  American depositary receipts of OAO Sberbank, Russia’s
largest lender, fell 3.7 percent to $8.28, the lowest since the
shares began trading on June 28. Sberbank dropped 3.1 percent on
the Micex to 68.34 rubles, or the equivalent of $2.09.  OAO Gazprom, the world’s biggest natural gas exporter,
declined 4.2 percent to $9.15 in New York after shares in Moscow
lost 1.6 percent to 153.55 rubles, the equivalent of $4.69. OAO
Lukoil, Russia’s largest non-state oil producer, dropped 3.2
percent to $48.59 after shares in Moscow fell 2.2 percent to
1,600.80 rubles, or $48.93.  Rising Nickel  The  Standard & Poor’s  GSCI index of 24 raw materials fell
0.9 percent yesterday to 585.62 as copper futures touched a 14-
month low of $2.994 a pound, amid speculation demand for
industrial metals will wane as the global economy falters.  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, the world’s largest producer of the
metal, plunged 5.6 percent to $20.30 even as nickel gained 8.1
percent to $19,025 a ton on the London Metal Exchange. Norilsk
shares lost 4.2 percent on the Micex to 6,699 rubles, or
$204.58. Gold futures for delivery in December jumped 2.3
percent, to settle at $1,659.90 an ounce in New York.  The Market Vectors Russia ETF, a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, retreated 2 percent to $24.80, while the
Bank of  New York  Mellon Russia ADR Index declined 2.9 percent.  The Micex has lost 20 percent in 2011 and trades at 4.8
times analysts’ earnings estimates for member stocks. That
compares with a 27 percent slide for  Brazil ’s Bovespa index,
which trades at 8.7 times estimated earnings, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The Shanghai Composite Index trades at
10.9 times estimated earnings, and the BSE India Sensitive Index
has a ratio of 13.6.  The RTS index lost 30 percent in the third quarter and the
Micex fell 18 percent.  The euro was little changed at 1.3184 per dollar yesterday.
Russia’s ruble weakened 1.1 percent to 32.5950 per dollar in
Moscow, the weakest level since July 2009, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
