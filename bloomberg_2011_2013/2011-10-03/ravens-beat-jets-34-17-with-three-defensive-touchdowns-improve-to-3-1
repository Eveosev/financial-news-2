The  Baltimore Ravens  scored three
defensive touchdowns in a 34-17 win over the New York Jets.  Jameel McClain and Jarret Johnson each had first-half
fumble returns for touchdowns, while Lardarius Webb had a 75-
yard interception return for a score during the third quarter at
M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore. Jets quarterback  Mark Sanchez 
committed all three turnovers that led to scores.  The Ravens have won two straight to improve to 3-1 and the
Jets lost their second road game in a row to fall to 2-2. The
Jets were held to 38 rushing yards, their fewest since 2006, in
losing to Baltimore for the seventh consecutive time.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
