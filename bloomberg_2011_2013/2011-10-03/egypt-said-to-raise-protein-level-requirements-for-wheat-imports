Egypt ’s state-run General Authority
for Supply Commodities raised the protein level required for
wheat imports, said two traders who have seen the document
outlining the changes.  The minimum level of protein was raised to 12.5 percent for
Kazakhstan wheat from 12 percent previously, 12 percent for
Russian and Romanian wheat from 11.5 percent and 11.5 percent
for all other origins from 11 percent, the traders said.  The new specifications applied to the authority’s last
tender on Sept. 29, when the authority, also known as Gasc,
bought 120,000 metric tons of Russian wheat and a similar amount
of Kazakh wheat, according to the traders.  Gasc buys between 5 million to 6 million tons of the grain
a year by international tenders because local production is too
low to meet demand in the Arab world’s most populous nation and
wants to diversify its range of sources. Egypt, with a
population of about 80 million people, uses imported wheat to
make subsidized bread.  To contact the reporter on this story:
