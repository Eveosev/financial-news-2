Zimbabwe’s telecommunications
regulator wants to allow authorities access to encrypted data or
e-mails sent via  Research in Motion Ltd. (RIM) ’s Blackberry devices,
an official said.  “In terms of the law, there should be a facility to allow
for such interception as well as decryption of the encrypted
messages/e-mails,” Hilda Mutseyekwa, an official with the
Postal Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe, said today in a written
response to questions.  Two local mobile operators,  Econet Wireless Zimbabwe Ltd. (ECWH) 
and Telecell, have formally applied with the regulator to offer
Blackberry services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
