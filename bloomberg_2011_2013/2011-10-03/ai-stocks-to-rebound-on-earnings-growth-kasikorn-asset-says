Thai stocks may rebound from their
worst quarterly performance in three years as  government
spending  will boost the earnings of mobile-phone companies and
retailers, according to the nation’s biggest money manager.  The benchmark SET Index may reach 1,000 by the end of this
year, Patchara Samalapa, managing director of Kasikorn Asset
Management Co., said in an interview in Bangkok today. Kasikorn
Asset manages about $22 billion.  “Thai equities have been badly hurt by global investors’
fear of risky assets,” Patchara said. “With the SET Index
below 900, most share prices are really attractive relative to
their earnings growth outlook.”  Patchara recommends shares of phone companies whose
earnings will be less affected by the economic slowdown.
Consumer-related companies such as operators of  convenience
stores  and hypermarkets will also benefit from government
policies aimed at boosting consumption.  To contact the reporter on this story:
