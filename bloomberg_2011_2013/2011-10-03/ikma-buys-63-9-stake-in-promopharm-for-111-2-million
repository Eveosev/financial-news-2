Hikma Pharmaceuticals Plc (HIK)  bought a
controlling stake in Moroccan drugmaker Societe de Promotion
Pharmaceutique du Maghreb SA to gain entry to the country’s
burgeoning market for medicines.  Hikma purchased 63.9 percent of the company, also known as
Promopharm, for $111.2 million in cash and will start a tender
offer for the rest of the company, said the London-based
drugmaker in a statement today. The acquisition will be funded
through a seven-year syndicated loan, Hikma said.  Sales of pharmaceutical products in Morocco, which reached
$1.7 billion last year, are expected to grow 9 percent annually
between 2010 and 2014, said Hikma, which was founded in Amman,
Jordan. Promopharm is the ninth-largest drugmaker in the North
African nation with a 3.5 percent share of the market, earning
more than $45 million in yearly revenue, Hikma said.  “It’s a play on developing markets, and as frontier
markets go,  Morocco  is relatively stable,” said  Les Funtleyder ,
a portfolio manager and health-care strategist at Miller Tabak &
Co. in  New York . “North Africa is Hikma’s sweet spot.”  Hikma has identified 20 anti-infective, central nervous
system, cardiovascular and diabetes products for distribution in
Morocco, the company said today.  “Entering the Moroccan market has been a strategic
priority for Hikma for some time,” Said Darwazah, chief
executive officer of Hikma, said in the statement. “We will
continue to pursue further value-enhancing opportunities across
our operations.”  Hikma fell 1.1 percent to close at 563.5 pence in  London 
today. The stock has lost 31 percent so far this year.  Makiko Kitamura in London at +44-20-7673-0712 or
