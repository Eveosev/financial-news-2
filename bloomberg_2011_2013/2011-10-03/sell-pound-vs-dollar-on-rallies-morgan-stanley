Investors should sell the pound
versus the dollar, betting it will weaken to $1.48, according to
Morgan Stanley.  The pound may weaken as the “vulnerable” U.K. economy
slows and the  Bank of England  resumes its quantitative-easing
policy, London-based currency strategist Tim Davis wrote in an
e-mailed note today. Investors should sell sterling if it climbs
to $1.59, Davis wrote. The bank recommends exiting the trade if
the U.K. currency strengthens to $1.62.  Nine of 30 economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict the
Bank of England will increase its asset-purchase target by at
least 50 billion pounds ($78 billion) from 200 billion pounds on
Oct. 6. The central bank will keep its main  interest rate  at a
record low 0.5 percent, according to all 53 respondents to a
separate survey.  “With the dual supports of stable monetary and fiscal
policy under attack from slowing domestic and global growth and
with pound-dollar lightly positioned, we believe that there is
good value in selling the pair on rallies,” Davis wrote. “We
may see a good opportunity to enter short pound-dollar positions
on a potential relief rally on Wednesday if the Bank of England
does not announce QE.”  The pound declined 0.4 percent to $1.5522 at 12:23 p.m. in
 London . It weakened 2.9 percent against the greenback in the
third quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
