 Mohamed  bin Hammam , a one-time
challenger for the FIFA presidency who was banned over vote-
buying claims, failed to block the appointment of his
replacement as head of the Asian Football Confederation.  Bin Hammam’s appeal was rejected by the Court of
Arbitration for Sport on Sept. 30, the AFC said today on its
website. Chinese official Zhang Jilong was named acting
president when Bin Hammam was provisionally banned over
corruption claims by FIFA. He was given a life ban from soccer
in July, a decision upheld by an appeals committee on Sept. 15.  The Qatari was found guilty of buying votes in the FIFA
leadership contest against incumbent Sepp Blatter. Bin Hammam
said the ban was politically motivated and that he had the
resources to fight for years to clear his name. His legal team
has filed an appeal against his expulsion from soccer with CAS.  Bin Hammam had claimed Jilong’s appointment as AFC acting
president and nomination to FIFA’s decision-making body breached
the confederation’s rules. The AFC said today it had “strictly
followed” its statutes at all times.  FIFA’s decision to expel Bin Hammam came after an
investigation led by former U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation
director  Louis Freeh  into claims he offered Caribbean soccer
officials envelopes containing $40,000 while campaigning in the
region. FIFA vice president  Jack Warner , who arranged Bin
Hammam’s visit to the Caribbean, was also suspended and quit the
sport before the end of Freeh’s inquiry. He denied wrongdoing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
