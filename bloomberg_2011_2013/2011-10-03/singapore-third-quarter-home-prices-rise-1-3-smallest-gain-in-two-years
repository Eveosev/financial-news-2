Singapore’s private home prices rose
1.3 percent, the smallest gain in more than two years, the Urban
Redevelopment Authority said in a statement.  The government agency’s private residential property index
climbed to 205.7 points in the third quarter from 203 points in
the previous three months, according to the statement. The
report is based on transactions in the first 10 weeks of the
quarter and a detailed report will be released four weeks later.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
