State Bank of Mauritius Ltd. (SBM)  expects
non-interest income to grow by at least 10 percent in its
current fiscal year, Reuters said, citing Chandradev Appadoo,
divisional leader for corporate affairs and finance.  Non-interest income grew by more than 20 percent in the
year through June and Appadoo said this segment would be helped
by the lenderâ€™s e-commerce division and strong commissions,
Reuters said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
