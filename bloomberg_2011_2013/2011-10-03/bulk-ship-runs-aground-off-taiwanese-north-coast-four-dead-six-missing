Jui Hsing, a Panama-registered gravel
vessel, ran aground off the northern coast of  Taiwan , leaving
four dead and six missing today, Shih Yi-che, a spokesman at the
Coast Guard Administration said by phone.  Other 11 crew members on the 11,500-metric ton ship were
rescued by the rescue forces, he said. The administration and
other related government agencies are trying to prevent the
shipâ€™s 200 tons of diesel and 80 tons of heavy fuel from
