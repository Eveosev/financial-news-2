Automakers, while beating estimates
for industry sales, reduced spending on incentives for U.S.
customers in September by 3.5 percent to an average of $2,653
per vehicle, according to Autodata Corp.  Ford Motor Co. (F) , the second-largest U.S. automaker, cut
spending on discounts and promotions by 6.6 percent from a year
earlier to an estimated $2,845 per vehicle,  Woodcliff Lake , New
Jersey-based Autodata said yesterday in an e-mailed statement.
Chrysler Group LLC’s incentives fell 5.7 percent to $3,425.
Nissan Motor Co. reduced discounts by 5.7 percent to $2,748.  Industrywide light-vehicle sales ran at a seasonally
adjusted annualized rate of 13.1 million in September. That’s
the fastest pace since April’s 13.2 million and exceeds the 12.8
million rate that was the average of 14 analysts’ estimates.
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and Honda Motor Co., which returned to full
output last month for the first time since  Japan ’s tsunami in
March, boosted incentive spending during the month.  “There will be temptation for automakers to pump up
incentives to grab that market share that was lost over the
summer,” Dan Montague, an analyst at the Autofacts forecasting
unit of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, said yesterday. “Incentives
will rise, there’s no question about that. But there won’t be
any type of incentive war like what we’ve seen in the past.”  Honda, the second-largest Japanese automaker by U.S. sales,
increased spending by 6 percent to $2,337 per vehicle. Toyota
raised incentives 5.5 percent to an estimated $2,238, Autodata
said.  General Motors Co. (GM)  boosted incentives 1.9 percent to 
$3,289 per vehicle.  Through September, industrywide average spending on U.S.
incentives fell 9.6 percent to $2,498 per vehicle.  To contact the reporter on this story:
