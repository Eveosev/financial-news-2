Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff 
said budget cuts alone won’t be enough to tackle  Europe ’s
sovereign-debt crisis.  “Taking only drastic fiscal measures will cause more
difficulties and stagnation,” Rousseff told reporters today in
Brussels, according to Belga news agency. “Trying to solve the
crisis without investment or without stimulating domestic demand
is difficult.”  Rousseff meets today and tomorrow with European Union
officials including EU President  Herman Van Rompuy  and European
Commission President  Jose Barroso .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
