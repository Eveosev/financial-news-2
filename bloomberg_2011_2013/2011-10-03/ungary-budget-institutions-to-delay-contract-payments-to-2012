The Hungarian government has ordered
budgetary institutions to set aside 577 billion forint ($2.6
billion) in savings this year by delaying some contractual
payment obligations to 2012, an Economy Ministry official said.  Ministries and other institutions controlled by the
government must make 577 billion forint in savings by the end of
the year to ensure that the  budget deficit  is kept in check,
Tibor Haag, a department head at the ministry told a
parliamentary committee today.  “We encourage institutions to renegotiate some of their
contracts to delay the payment to 2012 and also to push back the
start of some projects to next year,” Haag said.  The cabinet has already set aside 250 billion forint in
budget reserves this year and ordered a freeze of public
procurement in September to keep the budget deficit below 3
percent of GDP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
