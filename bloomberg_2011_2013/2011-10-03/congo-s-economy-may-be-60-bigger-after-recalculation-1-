The  Democratic Republic  of Congo’s
gross domestic product may increase as much as 60 percent after
a recalculation of the size of the country’s economy, Planning
Minister Olivier Kamitatu said.  The Central African nation is working with the
 International Monetary Fund  to update its statistics and capture
the full extent of the country’s economic output, Kamitatu told
a mines and infrastructure conference in Kinshasa, the capital,
today.  “We’re much closer to $20 billion in real U.S. dollars
than the $14 billion” previously announced, he said.  The new GDP figures will attempt to encompass the country’s
informal sector and will be an improvement on the country’s
method of keeping statistics, which dates back to the 1960s,
Kamitatu said.  Only 2 percent of Congolese have formal employment in the
private sector, while another 6 percent work in the government’s
civil service, including members of the police and army,
Kamitatu said. About 90 percent of the country is underemployed
and works in the informal sector, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
