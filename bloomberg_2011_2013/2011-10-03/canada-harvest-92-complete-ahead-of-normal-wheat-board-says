The harvest in the Canadian prairies
is 92 percent complete, ahead of the normal pace of 88 percent
and last year’s rate of 56 percent, the Canadian Wheat Board
said.  The grain harvest in Manitoba and Saskatchewan is “largely
complete,” while areas of  Alberta  will need “a couple more
weeks to finish,” the board said today in an e-mailed
statement. Above-normal temperatures allowed the harvest to
accelerate last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
