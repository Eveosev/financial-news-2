Top officials from the  National
Basketball Association  and players’ union are meeting for the
fifth time in seven days with postponement of the regular season
perhaps to come this week if a new labor deal can’t be reached.  A small group of top negotiators, including NBA
Commissioner  David Stern  and  National Basketball Players
Association Executive  Director  Billy Hunter , are meeting today a
Manhattan hotel. Both sides’ full negotiating committees are
scheduled to join the talks tomorrow.  With the regular season scheduled to begin Nov. 1, the NBA
already has suspended training camps indefinitely and canceled
43 preseason games through Oct. 15.  After Stern and Hunter said two days ago that they were far
from reaching an agreement following a seven-hour bargaining
session, Stern said no schedule announcements would be made
prior to today’s session.  “Stay tuned,” he said. “We have nothing more to say
other than we won’t do it on Monday.”  The only other time the start of the NBA season was delayed
due to a work stoppage was in 1998, when the league canceled the
first two weeks of the season three weeks before it was
scheduled to begin. That dispute was eventually settled in
January 1999 and the teams began a 50-game season -- shortened
from 82 -- in February.  During this dispute, the two sides are trying to decide how
to split money from a league that had about $4.3 billion in
revenue last season, a period during which Stern says the league
collectively lost about $300 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
