na รป not available  Prices are determined by a USDA survey of grain purchasers
with elevators located in seven regions of  Montana . Prices are
displayed as a "low-high" range, or as a "single" price 
depending upon the degree of consensus among the purchasers.  Durum wheat is the hardest wheat. The test weight is at least 
60 pounds a bushel. Durum averages 15 percent protein and is 
mainly used in the making of pasta.
