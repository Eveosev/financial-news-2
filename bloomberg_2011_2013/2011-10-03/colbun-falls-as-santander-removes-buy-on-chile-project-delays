Colbun SA (COLBUN) , Chile’s second-largest
power producer, fell for the first time in three days after
Banco Santander SA cut its rating to “hold” from “buy,”
citing results that missed estimates and project delays.  Colbun retreated 2.5 percent to 126.53 pesos at 3:15 p.m.
New York time in Santiago trading, erasing gains in the previous
two sessions.  Santander analysts Cristian Jadue, Francisco Errandonea and
Marcio Prado set a 2012 price estimate of 145 pesos for the
company controlled by Chile’s Matte family, according to a note
to clients distributed by e-mail.  Colbun’s first-half profit was affected by higher operating
costs and “lower hydro conditions than we had expected,” the
Santander analysts said. They cut their 2011 forecast for
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization by
47 percent to $141 million from $266 million.  The estimated start of the company’s 309-megawatt Angostura
hydroelectric project was pushed back to 2014 from 2013,
Santander wrote.  Colbun had a net loss of $45 million in the first six
months of the year compared with a profit of $78.3 million a
year earlier, according to data on the Chilean securities
regulator’s website. Sales rose to $651 million from $490
million over the same period.  Colbun, based in Santiago, is  Chile ’s biggest electricity
generator by market value after Empresa Nacional de Electricidad
SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
