GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA’s Romanian unit will work
with local energy regulators on an investigation into natural-
gas supply costs.  “It’s a routine investigation as the regulator seeks to
verify the compliance with the rules of gas supplying and the
viability of our licenses,” the company said in an e-mailed
response to Bloomberg News questions.  Romanian’s energy regulator, known as ANRE, is
investigating the unit over its acquisition costs with domestic
and imported gas, as well as consulting costs from 2007 and
until the end of June 2011, Mediafax newswire reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
