Asian stocks fell, extending the
regional benchmark index’s biggest quarterly decline in almost
three years, after U.S. consumer spending slowed as incomes
unexpectedly dropped, souring the earnings outlook for
exporters.  Sony Corp. (6758)  plunged as much as 6.2 percent in Tokyo,
touching its lowest price in 24 years.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the
world’s largest carmaker, fell 2 percent.  James Hardie
Industries SE (JHX) , a building-materials supplier that gets almost 70
percent of its sales from the U.S., sank 3.5 percent in Sydney.
 BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s No. 1 mining company, dropped 2.5
percent after oil and metal prices slid.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,
Europe’s biggest lender, led banking stocks lower.  “The U.S. is not falling into recession, but it’s
definitely slowing down,” said Diane Lin, a fund manager with
Sydney-based fund Pengana Capital Ltd., which manages about $1.1
billion in global assets. “We might face more risks,
particularly in a market that hasn’t had enough of a
correction.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 2.7 percent to 110.10 as
of 5:38 p.m. in Mumbai, ahead of a meeting of European finance
ministers to weigh the threat of a Greek default. About seven
stocks fell for each that rose in the gauge and all 10 industry
groups declined. The gauge has dropped 20 percent this year amid
concern the global economy is poised for another recession as
 Europe ’s debt crisis worsens and U.S. economic growth slows.  Tankan Survey  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 1.8 percent after the
Bank of Japan’s quarterly Tankan index showed that sentiment
among Japan’s largest manufacturers remains worse than before
the March earthquake. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 slumped 2.8
percent as a gauge of Australian manufacturing fell for a third
month in September.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index plunged 4.4 percent, led by
Ping An Insurance Group Co.,  China ’s No. 2 insurance company by
market value, amid signs China’s economic growth is slowing.
Financial markets in China and South Korea are closed for
holidays today.  “Economic indicators are suggesting that the economy in
mainland China is slowing,” said Linus Yip, chief strategist at
First Shanghai Securities in Hong Kong. Financial and property
stocks are falling on concern that banking liquidity is
shrinking, he said.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.2 percent
today. In  New York , the index fell 2.5 percent on Sept. 30,
sending the measure to its biggest quarterly drop since 2008,
after reports from China and Germany fueled concerns the global
economy is slowing.  Consumer Spending  Consumer spending in the U.S. slowed in August as incomes
unexpectedly dropped for the first time in almost two years,
forcing households to dip into savings. Purchases rose 0.2
percent after a 0.7 percent increase in July, Commerce
Department figures showed on Sept. 30. Incomes decreased 0.1
percent, the first decline since October 2009. Economists had
forecast incomes would rise 0.1 percent, according to a
Bloomberg survey.  Sony plunged 4.5 percent to 1,439 yen at the close of
trading in Tokyo on speculation the yen’s appreciation and
falling demand for televisions will hurt earnings.  Toyota dropped 2 percent to 2,635 yen.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the
biggest global camera-maker, slid 1.7 percent to 3,490 yen.
James Hardie declined 3.5 percent to A$5.55 in Sydney. In Hong
Kong,  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier of toys and clothes to Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., sank 5.9 percent to HK$12.44.  Banks Decline  Banks in Asia also slumped. HSBC sank 4.2 percent to
HK$58.35 in Hong Kong.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) ,
Japan’s No. 1 listed lender by market value, declined 2.8
percent to 344 yen.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , the nation’s
biggest bank, slid 3.7 percent to A$43.88 in Sydney.  European officials gathering in Luxembourg today will
grapple with how to shield banks from the debt crisis and
consider a further boost to the region’s rescue fund. The Greek
government said yesterday it approved 6.6 billion euros ($8.8
billion) of austerity measures as part of efforts to secure a
pending aid payment and a second rescue package.  “To keep paying Greece money doesn’t actually solve a
long-term problem,” said Pengana’s Lin.  Asian commodity stocks also sank.  BHP Billiton  retreated
2.5 percent to A$34.15 in Sydney. Rival Rio Tinto Ltd. sank 4.1
percent to A$59.30. Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s No. 1 producer
of the metal by market value, dropped 12 percent to HK$12.18.  ‘Economy Is Decelerating’  Oil fell today, extending declines after the worst quarter
since 2008. Crude for November slid as much as 1.6 percent in
electronic trading in New York. A measure of primary metals
traded in  London  fell 3.4 percent on Sept. 30, when copper
futures declined for a third straight quarter, the longest slump
since 2001.  “While a deceleration of the global economy has largely
been priced into the markets, we’re not seeing anything to
change this,” said  Kenichi Hirano , general manager and
strategist at Tachibana Securities Co. in Tokyo. “For this
reason, we’ll likely see stocks move lower.”  Ping An Insurance plunged 13 percent to HK$38.30.  Tencent
Holdings Ltd. (700) , China’s biggest Internet company by revenue,
dropped 9.3 percent to HK$149.00.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 20 percent this year
through Sept. 30, compared with a 10 percent drop by the S&P 500
and an 18 percent loss by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in
the Asian benchmark are valued at 11.5 times estimated earnings
on average, compared with 11.4 times for the S&P 500 and 9.5
times for the Stoxx 600.  The Asia Pacific index tumbled 16 percent in the third
quarter, the biggest drop since 2008, as concern mounted that
Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis combined with a slowdown in the
U.S. economy may drag the world back into recession.  To contact the reporters on this story:
