Russia ’s grain harvest may increase
53 percent from last year to reach 93 million metric tons after
drying and cleaning if the weather is favorable, the country’s
 Grain Union  said.  The wheat crop is seen at 55 million tons, with about 60
percent of milling quality, and the feed barley harvest is
expected to be 16 million to 17 million tons this year, Arkady Zlochevsky, union’s president, said at a news conference in
Moscow today.  This year’s harvest is expected to be a record for crops
such as sunflower seeds with 9 million to 10 million tons, corn
with 6 million tons, rice with more than 1.2 million tons and
soybeans with more than 900,000 tons, Zlochevsky said.  Last year the grain crop fell by 37 percent due to drought.
It came to 60.9 million tons, including 41.46 million tons of
wheat, 8.32 million tons of barley, 5.34 million tons of
sunflower seeds, 3.0 million tons of corn, and 1.06 million tons
of rice, according to Rosstat, the Federal State Statistics
Service.  About 70 million tons of grain will be used domestically
and about 25 million tons will be exported, Zlochevsky said,
adding another 5 million tons is available, but that shipments
would be limited due to transportation costs and infrastructure
capacity.  Kazakhstan plans to export between 7 million and 8 million
tons of grain through Black Sea ports, which compete with
Russia, Zlochevsky said. Those shipments along with Ukraine’s
export potential of 24 million tons this marketing season may
increase competition and reduce Russia’s wheat price to $220 a
ton on a free-on-board basis in December, he said.  In the latest tender in  Egypt  last week, the country sold
wheat at about $250 a ton, Zlochevsky said.  Southeast Asia   Russia’s wheat is no longer traded at a discount to the
world price, which was about $40 a ton after the country opened
exports on July 1, Zlochevsky said. The cheap rate let the
country initiate active wheat and barley shipments to Southeast
Asia. Russia may export up to 1 million tons in the region in
the current marketing year, according to the union estimate.  Russia’s farmers have started winter sowing, and about 17
million hectares (42 million acres) of grains will be planted in
2011, Zlochevsky said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
