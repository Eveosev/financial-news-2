Ohio State University tailback Daniel
Herron and receiver DeVier Posey, who received five-game bans
for their part in the scandal that resulted in the resignation
of former coach  Jim Tressel , might be suspended an additional
game, according to the  Columbus Dispatch .  Herron, Posey, left tackle Mike Adams, defensive end
Solomon Thomas and former quarterback Terrelle Pryor were
suspended the first five games of the season for accepting
improper benefits from a tattoo parlor. Tressel resigned in May.  A second probe into Herron and Posey by the  National
Collegiate Athletic Association  might show the players received
previously undisclosed benefits stemming from their summer jobs
and could be suspended one additional game, the Dispatch
reported. Pryor left school and now is on the  National Football
League ’s Oakland Raiders.  Adams and Thomas are expected to be cleared for Saturday
night’s game against the Nebraska Cornhuskers, the Dispatch
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
