UBS AG (UBSN) ’s stock rating was cut by
Morgan Stanley, which said investors might be too optimistic on
the time it will take the Swiss bank to restructure.  Analysts Huw van Steenis and Hubert Lam cut the Zurich-
based bank to “equal-weight” from “overweight” in a note to
clients today. They also reduced the stock’s price target to 13
Swiss francs from 15 francs.  UBS, revamping operations after a $2.3 billion loss from
unauthorized trading, may have to cut risk-weighted assets by
about 100 billion francs ($110 billion), the analysts said. The
loss also may prevent the bank from granting shareholders
sizable dividends over the next three years, they said.  As other wholesale banks may also seek to shrink their
balance sheets by as much as 2 trillion euros ($2.7 trillion)
over the next 18 months in response to funding pressures, it may
take UBS three to five years to shed assets, the analysts said.
They said they expected no profit from UBS’s investment bank
this year.  UBS shares fell 3.4 percent to 10.18 Swiss francs by 5 p.m.
in Zurich trading, after dropping as much as 5.1 percent
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
