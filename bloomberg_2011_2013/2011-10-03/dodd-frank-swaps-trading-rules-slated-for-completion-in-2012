Dodd-Frank Act rules governing
trading in the $601 trillion global swaps market won’t be
completed until the first quarter of 2012, said  Gary Gensler ,
chairman of the U.S.  Commodity Futures Trading Commission .  The CFTC and Securities and Exchange Commission are
drafting rules for so-called swap execution facilities and
exchanges that will handle trades for credit-default swaps,
interest-rate swaps and other derivatives.  “When markets are open and transparent, price competition
is facilitated and costs are lowered,” Gensler said in a speech
prepared for Sefcon II, a New York conference held by the
Wholesale Markets Brokers’ Association, Americas.  Gensler said the agencies are paying attention to the
differences between futures and securities markets. Regulators
are mindful that rules for swap execution facilities and
existing rules for exchanges “do not undermine the transparent
futures market,” Gensler said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
