European Union Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said an option for including the
 European Central Bank  in leveraging of the euro area’s temporary
bailout fund will be on the table when finance ministers meet in
Luxembourg today.  “We are reviewing options and options including the ECB and
not including the ECB are certainly something we will discuss
today in the meeting,” Rehn told reporters in Luxembourg. “We
are reviewing options over optimizing the use of the EFSF in
order to have more out of it and have it more effective as a
financial firewall to contain contagion in financial markets,
and in this regard leveraging is one of the options.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
