U.S. Gulf crude premiums strengthened
after the discount for West Texas Intermediate versus Brent
widened.  The gap between WTI and Brent November contracts increased
25 cents to $23.81 a barrel in  New York . The spread settled
Sept. 6 at a record margin of $26.87.  When Brent increases versus WTI, it strengthens the value
of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil
priced against the European benchmark.  The discount of WTI for November delivery to the December
contract widened 9 cents to 22 cents after Enbridge Inc. shut
its Ozark pipeline that transports oil from Cushing,  Oklahoma ,
to Wood River,  Illinois .  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened 85 cents to
$26.75 a barrel at 2:02 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium added 75
cents to $25.75.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend added $1 to $23 a barrel while Poseidon strengthened 85
cents to $22.35 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium widened $1.35 to $21.85 a
barrel and West Texas Sour’s discount weakened 5 cents to 90
cents a barrel below WTI. Thunder Horse’s premium increased 75
cents to $26 above the benchmark.  The premium for Syncrude was unchanged at $7.75 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select was unchanged at
$10.50 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
