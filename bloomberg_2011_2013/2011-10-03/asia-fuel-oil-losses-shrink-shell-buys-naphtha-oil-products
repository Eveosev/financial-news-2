Refiners’ losses from making  fuel oil 
dropped to the lowest in almost 20 months. Royal Dutch Shell Plc
bought a naphtha cargo in Singapore.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude shrank 65 cents, or 24
percent, to $2.06 a barrel at 2:20 p.m. Singapore time,
according to PVM Oil Associates, a London-based broker. This
discount is the smallest since Feb. 8, 2010.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade rose $1.50, or 21 percent, to $8.50 a metric ton. This
viscosity spread is the widest since Sept. 21, indicating bunker
fuel prices have fallen more than higher-quality fuel oil.  PetroChina Co. sold 20,000 tons of 380-centistoke fuel oil
to Hin Leong Trading Pte at $625 a ton, according to traders who
monitored transactions on the Platts pricing “window” today.  Light Distillates  Shell, whose largest refinery was halted by a fire last
week, also plans to shut its naphtha cracker at Pulau Bukom in
 Singapore , according to a person with direct knowledge of the
matter.  The refiner bought 25,000 tons of naphtha for first-half
December delivery from Glencore International AG at $871 a ton,
the survey of traders showed.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures fell
to $102.29 a metric ton at 5:45 p.m. Singapore time from $120.33
at the end of Asian trading on Sept. 30, based on data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude oil fell 23 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $18.07 a barrel at 2:20 p.m. Singapore time, PVM
data showed. This crack spread, a measure of refining profit
from the fuel, rose to $18.30 a barrel on Sept. 30, the highest
since Sept. 1.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil jumped to $2.70 from $1.70 a
barrel, according to PVM. This regrade was the widest since
February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
