Citadele Banka AS, the Latvian lender
majority owned by the state, repaid 48.7 million euros ($65
million) used as a deposit to the lender, it said in a
statement.  Citadele has repaid 110.5 million euros in deposits and
interest to the state since August last year, according to the
e-mailed statement.  Latvia was forced to turn to a group led by the European
Commission and the  International Monetary Fund  for a 7.5
billion-euro loan after the second-biggest bank, Parex, needed a
state rescue. Parex was broken up into a commercial bank renamed
Citadele and an  asset management company  that would sell off
assets as their value recovered over time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
