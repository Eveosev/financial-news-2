Stocks and commodities sank, sending
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and oil to more than one-year
lows, and the euro slid as concern about  Europe ’s debt crisis
overshadowed higher-than-estimated U.S. economic data. Treasury
bonds rallied as the Federal Reserve bought longer-term debt.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 2.9 percent to
1,099.23 at 4 p.m. New York time as Bank of America Corp.
plunged 9.6 percent to a 30-month low. The Stoxx Europe 600
Index slid 1.1 percent. The S&P GSCI Index of commodities fell
0.9 percent and reached a 10-month low. The euro dropped versus
13 of 16 major peers, sinking to the lowest level in more than a
decade against the yen. The 30-year Treasury yield plunged 18
basis points to 2.74 percent, the least since January 2009.  The S&P 500 closed at the lowest level since Sept. 8, 2010,
and came within 1 percent of extending its decline from this
year’s high to 20 percent, the common definition of a bear
market. German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  opposed moves
to increase the scale of the euro rescue fund, damping
speculation of a breakthrough in Luxembourg talks to quell the
debt crisis. Greece passed plans to cut its  budget deficit  that
missed previous goals set as part of its bailout conditions.  “Europe is still going to be the focus,”  Peter Jankovskis , who helps manage about $2.2 billion at Oakbrook
Investments in Lisle,  Illinois , said in a telephone interview.
“The ’risk-on, risk-off’ trade is going to continue.”  Accelerated Losses  U.S. stocks extended declines after briefly erasing losses
in early trading following data on manufacturing industries and
construction spending that topped economists’ estimates. The
Institute for Supply Management’s factory index climbed to 51.6
last month from 50.6 in August, above the level of 50 that is
the dividing line between growth and contraction and higher than
the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News for
a drop to 50.5. The Commerce Department said construction
spending increased 1.4 percent in August, defying the median
forecast for a 0.2 percent drop.  Losses increased in the  S&P 500  after the gauge fell below
a series of levels considered significant by analysts and
traders whose investment decisions are influenced by charts. The
index slipped below 1,119.46, its lowest close of the year, just
before 12:50 p.m. and breached 1,114.22, the worst intraday
level of September, about 15 minutes later.  “There’s reason to think that the bears will take
control,”  Ryan Detrick , senior technical strategist at
Schaeffer’s Investment Research in Cincinnati, said in a
telephone interview. “We violated that low for the year. It
could definitely lead to some accelerated selling here.”  ‘Overweight Diabetic’  The S&P 500 tumbled 14 percent in the third quarter, while
the Stoxx 600 sank 17 percent and the S&P GSCI slid 12 percent,
with each posting its biggest drop since the fourth quarter of
2008 amid the aftermath of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s
bankruptcy.  Bill Gross , the manager of the world’s biggest bond fund,
said the global economy risks lapsing into a recession because
“sovereign balance sheets resemble an overweight diabetic on
the verge of a heart attack,” according to a monthly investment
outlook posted on his Pacific Investment Management Co.’s
website today.  Bank of America sank 9.6 percent to $5.53, its lowest price
since March 11, 2009. The largest  U.S. bank  by assets said that
access to its online accounts was slower or halted for a second
consecutive weekday because of heavy customer traffic. Company
spokeswoman Tara Burke denied rumors that the slowness was the
result of hacking.  Financial, Energy Shares  Financial and energy companies led losses in all 10
industry groups in the S&P 500, with the groups dropping at
least 3.3 percent. All but one of 81 companies in the S&P 500
Financials Index retreated, dragging the gauge to the lowest
level since July 2009. Citigroup Inc. lost 9.8 percent and
JPMorgan Chase & Co. fell 4.9 percent. Alcoa Inc., which will
unofficially mark the start of the third-quarter earnings season
next week, slid 7 percent after JPMorgan cut its earnings and
share-price estimates.  AMR Corp. tumbled 33 percent, the most in eight years, on
growing concern the airline may be forced to seek bankruptcy
protection. A Chapter 11 filing “is certainly not our goal or
our preference,” said Andy Backover, an American spokesman.
“We know we need to improve our results, and we have a sense of
urgency as we work to achieve that.”  All but two of 19 industry groups declined in the Stoxx 600
as Commerzbank AG,  Germany ’s second-largest lender, and Societe
Generale SA of  France  dropped more than 5 percent. Dexia SA
slumped 10 percent in Brussels on concern the bank is struggling
to fund itself and will need a second bailout.  The  Federal Reserve  Bank of New York may ask foreign
lenders for more detailed daily reports on liquidity as the U.S.
steps up monitoring of risks from Europe’s sovereign debt
crisis, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  Liquidity Reviews  Regulators held informal talks with some of the largest
European banks about producing a “fourth-generation daily
liquidity” or 4G report, according to the people, who asked for
anonymity because communications with central bankers are
confidential. The reports may cover potential liabilities such
as foreign-exchange swaps and credit-default swaps, said one
person. The U.S. has already increased the number of examiners
embedded in these banks, the person said.  The Financial Stability Board backed plans for the world’s
largest banks to set aside additional capital and develop
measures to wind down their operations in a crisis, the group’s
chairman  Mario Draghi  said today.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of credit-default swaps on
125 companies with investment-grade ratings climbed as much as
eight basis points to 210.5, the highest since December 2008 and
approaching the record 215 basis points set that month,
according to JPMorgan.  ‘Avoiding Contagion’  “The big issue in the  euro zone  remains avoiding contagion
from the all-but-inevitable Greek sovereign default,” Larry Hatheway, the head of macro strategy at UBS AG in  London , wrote
in a report today. We are “unlikely to get much relief from
euro zone uncertainties in the coming months.”  The yield on the Greek 10-year bond lost six basis points
to 22.62 percent. The yield on Italy’s two-year security fell
five basis points and  Spain ’s increased one point as the
 European Central Bank  bought the nations’ bonds, according to
four people with knowledge of the transactions. The Markit
iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-default swaps on 15
governments rose 1.9 basis points to 342.35, compared with the
record high of 358.5 set Sept. 23, according to CMA.  Greek Austerity  The Greek government passed 6.6 billion euros ($8.8
billion) of austerity measures to cut the 2012 deficit to 6.8
percent of gross domestic product, missing the 6.5 percent goal
previously set with the European Union,  International Monetary
Fund  and European Central Bank, known as the troika. Finance
Minister Evangelos Venizelos had earlier said  Greece  would miss
the targets and the troika accepted the new budget. Euro region
finance ministers meet again Oct. 13 to decide on a sixth
bailout payment.  The euro depreciated 1.5 percent to $1.3193, the lowest
since January. The European currency dropped 2 percent to 101.08
yen, the lowest against its Japanese counterpart since June
2001. The Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against
those of six trading partners, climbed 1.3 percent and the yen
strengthened against all 16 major peers.  Treasury Spreads  Ten-year Treasury yields slid 17 basis points to 1.75
percent and the spread between five-year and 30-year securities
decreased to 187 basis points, the narrowest on a closing basis
since October 2009. The Fed bought Treasuries today maturing
from February 2036 through August 2041, the first under a
program announced Sept. 21 to buy $400 billion of bonds with
maturities of six to 30 years through June while selling an
equal amount of debt maturing in three years or less to keep
borrowing costs down.  Among 24 commodities tracked by the S&P GSCI Index, 16
retreated. Crude oil for November delivery decreased 2 percent
to $77.61 a barrel, the lowest settlement since Sept. 28, 2010.
Nickel surged 8.1 percent, while gold futures jumped 2.2 percent
to $1,657.70 an ounce  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index sank 3.2 percent, following
its 23 percent plunge in the three months ended Sept. 30.  To contact the reporters on this story:
