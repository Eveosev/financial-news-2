Serbian support for joining the
European Union fell to 46 percent in September from 53 percent
in June after incidents on the border with  Kosovo ,  Vecernje
Novosti  reported, citing Deputy Premier Bozidar Djelic.  After “discouraging” EU moves regarding the Kosovo
tensions, popular support may fall further and the number of
those explicitly against EU membership may rise from 37 percent
now to the level equaling those who want to join the bloc, the
report quoted Djelic as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
