Creditors of Independencia SA, the
Brazilian meatpacker under  bankruptcy protection , rejected a
706.9 million-real ($376 million) offer for the company’s
assets, almost triple the value of a previous proposal.  Investors Alfredo Kaefer & Cia. Ltda. and Unibrax
Investimentos & Participações SA made a joint proposal in which
creditors of about 2 billion reais of debt would be repaid in as
many as 30 years from future cash flows, according to documents
distributed today at a creditors meeting in Sao Paulo. Under the
proposal, holders of 2016 bonds would receive 7.3 percent of the
debt in 30 years, while cattle ranchers would receive payments
totaling 12 percent of liabilities.  Independencia, whose creditors include Citigroup Inc. and
JPMorgan Chase & Co., has been under bankruptcy protection since
February 2009 and halted production in October 2010. The company
missed an interest payment on its 2015 senior notes in September
2010.  Creditors had previously rejected a 250 million-real rescue
plan presented by Kaefer in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
