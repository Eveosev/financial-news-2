The  Transportation Security
Administration  said it will purchase 30 document-scanning
systems to test at U.S. airport checkpoints early next year.  TSA employees will use the machines to verify boarding
passes and passenger identification such as drivers’ licenses,
the agency said in an e-mailed statement today. The machines,
which will cost a total of $3.2 million, are made by BAE Systems
Information Solutions Inc., Trans-Digital Technologies LLC and
NCR Government Systems LLC, the agency said.  “This technology will help facilitate risk-based security,
while making the process more effective and efficient,” TSA
Administrator John Pistole said in the statement.  In June, a Nigerian man passed through a checkpoint at  John
F. Kennedy International Airport  in  New York  and boarded a
Virgin America flight to Los Angeles using another passenger’s
boarding pass.  “The ability to automatically identify altered or
fraudulent passenger identification documents and boarding
passes will further enhance security,” Kristin Lee, a
spokeswoman for TSA, said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
