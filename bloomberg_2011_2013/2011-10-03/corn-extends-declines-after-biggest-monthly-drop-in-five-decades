Corn dropped to a nine-month low,
adding to its biggest monthly slide in at least five decades, as
commodities slumped amid concern the debt crisis in  Europe  will
curb growth. Wheat and soybeans also declined.  Corn for December delivery fell as much as 3.4 percent to
$5.7225 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the lowest price
since Dec. 13, and was at $5.79 by 2:29 p.m. Paris time. Corn
slumped 23 percent in September, the biggest monthly slide in
records going back to 1959.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of commodities fell 1
percent, with copper, sugar, and coffee sliding as European
Union finance ministers meet today to weigh the threat of a
default by  Greece , amid concern the Greek debt crisis will
spread to other countries in the region.  “You’re a brave man to be buying any of this at the
moment, there’s just contagion across the class,”  Greg Smith ,
executive director of Global Commodities Ltd., said in an
interview with Bloomberg Television today. “Cash is king,
whether it’s in commodities, whether it’s in equities.”  Corn extended a 6.3 percent drop on Sept. 30 after a report
showed larger-than-expected supplies in the U.S., the biggest
shipper, signaling slower demand for grain used in  animal feed 
and fuel.  U.S. supplies of corn were an estimated 1.128 billion
bushels on Sept. 1, the Department of Agriculture said Sept. 30,
about 20 percent more than the average prediction of 24 analysts
in a Bloomberg survey. Consumption in the U.S. fell 2.3 percent
from a year earlier to 2.54 billion bushels in the three months
ended Aug. 31 after prices rallied to a three-year high in June
on adverse weather concerns, weighing on demand.  Global Economic Uncertainty  “Is demand weakening, that’s the underlying question
raised by the numbers in the USDA report,” Paris-based farm
adviser Agritel wrote in an online comment. “The start of the
week remains marked by the uncertainty weighing on the state of
the global economy.”  The USDA number for corn inventories raises the stocks-to-
use ratio to 7 percent from 5.3 percent, all other things being
equal,  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  analysts Paul Deane and Victor Thianpiriya wrote in a report today.  “The USDA September stocks report was bearish for corn,”
Deane and Thianpiriya wrote.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators decreased
their net-long positions in Chicago corn futures in the week
ended Sept. 27, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data.  Speculative long positions, or bets prices will rise,
outnumbered short positions by 308,792 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade, the Washington-based commission said in its
Commitments of Traders report. Net-long positions fell by 42,486
contracts, or 12 percent, from a week earlier.  Oilseed Slump  Wheat for December delivery fell as much as 2.1 percent to
$5.9675 a bushel and was at $6.0475 in recent trading, following
a 6.9 percent plunge on Sept. 30. The grain lost 23 percent in
September, the biggest monthly drop since March 1974.  Milling wheat for November delivery fell 2 percent to
179.75 euros ($239.52) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in Paris after
earlier touching 178.50 euros, the lowest price for a most-
active contract since July 2010.  November-delivery soybeans declined 0.9 percent to $11.68 a
bushel, after dropping to $11.6225, the lowest level since Oct.
12, 2010. The oilseed slumped 19 percent in September, the
biggest monthly drop since September 2008, and 8.9 percent in
the three months ended Sept. 30.  To contact the reporters on this story:
