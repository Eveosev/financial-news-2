York on concern that  Greece  will default, leading to slower
global growth and a decline in fuel consumption.  Cnooc Ltd. (883)  , China’s largest offshore energy
producer, sank 4.5 percent to $153.06, the lowest price in a
week. The company’s shares were cut to “sell” from “buy” at

fell 1.1 percent to a one-week low of $119.16.  Focus Media Holding Ltd. (FMCN)  , which delivers

million shares since February 2010.  Solar industry fundamentals remain “weak on lower-than-
expected demand, severe pricing competition from second- and
third-tier companies,” Sanjay Shrestha, an analyst at Lazard
Capital Markets Ltd., wrote in a research report.  Suntech Power Holdings (STP US), the world’s largest maker
of solar panels, plunged 26 percent, the biggest loss since
November 2008, to a record low of $1.70. The slump triggered a
restriction by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that
forces traders who want to bet on declines through short-selling
to wait once the stock drops 10 percent from the prior day’s
close.  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL)  , China’s largest solar panel
maker by market capitalization, dropped 8.2 percent to $5.58,
