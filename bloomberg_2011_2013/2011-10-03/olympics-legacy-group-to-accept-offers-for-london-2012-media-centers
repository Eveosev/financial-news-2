The company selling facilities built
for 2012 Olympics will start accepting bids for two media
centers, the Games’ legacy company said today.  The  Olympic Park Legacy Company  will take offers for the
91,689 square meters (987,000 square feet) of space at buildings
over the next nine weeks, according to an e-mailed statement.
The asking price for the  London  properties, which will cost 350
million pounds ($543 million) to construct, wasn’t disclosed.  “The Press and Broadcast Centres have already generated a
huge amount of commercial interest and we are excited to see
what bids come,” Chief Executive Officer Andrew Altman said in
the e-mail.  London 2012 Olympic officials are seeking buyers for
buildings and sports facilities being erected for the Games as
they try to avoid problems faced by past host cities such as
 Athens  that were left with underused or dormant structures.  The centers, located in the northwest corner of the Olympic
Park, will have space for 8,000 journalists during the six-week
event. The Broadcast Centre has 8,872 square meters of  office
space  over five floors and 53,362 square meters of commercial
area. The five-story Press Centre has around 29,455 square
meters of office space.  The bidding process will end on Dec. 2 and the legacy
company will draw up a shortlist of potential winning buyers in
February. The buildings, which attracted 45 expressions of
interest last year, will be available starting in spring 2013,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
