The Nobel Assembly will examine its
rules to see if Ralph M. Steinman, honored today with
a  Nobel Prize  for medicine, can receive the award posthumously,
Goeran Hansson, secretary to the Nobel Committee and the Nobel
Assembly said by telephone.  Steinman was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer four years
ago, and his life was extended using an immunotherapy of his own
design, the New York-based Rockefeller University said in a
statement on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
