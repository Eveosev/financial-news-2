Edison SpA and Greek natural-gas
supply company Depa SA submitted a bid to export fuel from the
BP Plc-led Shah Deniz-2 deposit in  Azerbaijan , potentially
putting them in competition with the rival Nabucco project.  The joint bid will supply the planned Interconnection
Turkey Greece Italy, or ITGI, pipeline project designed to bring
Azeri gas from the Caspian region to Europe, Athens-based Depa
said today in an e-mailed statement.  Azerbaijan will be able to supply 10 billion cubic meters
of gas a year to Europe when the offshore deposit comes on
stream in 2017, Elshad Nasirov, vice president of State Oil Co.
of Azerbaijan, the national  oil company , said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
