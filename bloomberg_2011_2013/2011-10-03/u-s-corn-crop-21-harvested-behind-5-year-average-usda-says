The U.S. corn harvest was 21 percent
complete as of yesterday, compared with 15 percent a week earlier
and the previous five-year average of 23 percent, the Department of
Agriculture said.  An estimated 19 percent of the soybean crop was harvested, up
from 5 percent a week earlier and less than the five-year average
of 25 percent for the date, the USDA said today in report.  About 42 percent of the winter-wheat crop was planted, below
the five-year average of 53 percent, according to the report. A
week earlier, 26 percent of the crop had been sown.  To contact the reporters on this story:
