The rate banks pay to convert euro
payments into dollars rose to a three-week high, according to a
money markets indicator, as European finance ministers meet on
resolving the region’s debt crisis.  The three-month cross-currency basis swap was 109 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate as of 2:52 p.m. in
 London , compared with 105 basis points on Sept. 30. The cost was
112.5 basis points under Euribor on Sept. 12, when the swap was
the most expensive since December 2008.  Policy makers meeting in Luxembourg today are considering
expanding a euro area rescue fund after  Greece  missed a deficit
target for 2012. Greece said yesterday it approved new austerity
measures to cut the country’s budget gap and secure an
international bailout.  “The markets are beginning to worry” that Greece’s latest
disbursement may “not be forthcoming,”  Padhraic Garvey , head
of developed debt-market strategy at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam,
wrote in a note.  The one-year cross-currency basis swap was little changed
at 73 basis points less than Euribor from 72 on Friday. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  A measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another in
 Europe  was little changed. The Euribor-OIS spread, the
difference between three-month Euribor and overnight index
swaps, was 81 basis points, Bloomberg data show. The gap reached
a 2 1/2-year high of 89 on Sept. 23.  Deposits Increase  The ECB said financial institutions increased overnight
deposits to the highest since July 12, 2010. Banks left 199.6
billion euros ($267 billion) with the Frankfurt-based lender on
Friday, the ECB said, compared with 161 billion euros on Sept.
29 and a year-to-date average of 53 billion euros.  Three-month Euribor -- the rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in euros -- increased to 1.557 percent from
1.554 percent on Sept. 30. One-week Euribor fell to 1.197
percent from 1.208 percent.  The three-month dollar London interbank offered rate, or
Libor, rose for a 17th day to 0.378 percent from 0.374 percent,
according to the British Bankers’ Association. That’s the
highest since Aug. 11, 2010.  The TED spread, or the difference between what lenders and
the U.S. government pay to borrow for three months, rose to 37
basis points from 35 at the end of last week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
