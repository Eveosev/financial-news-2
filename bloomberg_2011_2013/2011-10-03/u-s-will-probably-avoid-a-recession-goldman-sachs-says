The  U.S. economy  will probably avoid
falling into recession, though the risks that it could are
“high and rising,” according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  Recent data on gross domestic product are mildly
encouraging and the U.S. housing market has “probably reached a
floor,”  Zach Pandl , senior economist at Goldman Sachs in  New
York , wrote in the report dated Sept. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
