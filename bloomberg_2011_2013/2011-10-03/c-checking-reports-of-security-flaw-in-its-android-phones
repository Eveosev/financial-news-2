HTC Corp. (2498)  said it’s investigating a
report that its smartphones that use  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android
operating system have a security vulnerability that may expose a
user’s personal information.  The company is “working to investigate this claim as
quickly as possible” and will determine “what steps, if any,
need to be taken,” according to a statement today from HTC.  Security site Android Police  said the flaw  is in Taoyuan,
Taiwan-based HTC’s own application software that runs on top of
Android. A user’s e-mail account, GPS location and phone numbers
may be vulnerable to hackers, according to the site. The phones
that may be affected include HTC’s Evos and Thunderbolts.  HTC has gained from the growth of smartphones that use the
Google system, rising to become the second-largest maker of
Android devices, behind Samsung Electronics Co. HTC’s Android
phones are likely to face added competition from the new
iPhone 5 that  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  may introduce tomorrow.  “Repeated software scares have not slowed down Android
growth at all, but it’s possible this might leave Microsoft
Windows Mobile a small opening on the enterprise side,” said
Tero Kuittinen, an independent wireless analyst.  “Companies are increasingly giving employees freedom to
choose their own smartphones,” he said. “But the new wave of
Windows models could benefit a bit from their perceived security
edge.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
