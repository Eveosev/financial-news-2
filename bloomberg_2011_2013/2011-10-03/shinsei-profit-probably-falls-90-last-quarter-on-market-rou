Shinsei Bank Ltd. (8303) , the Japanese
lender partly owned by J. Christopher Flowers, probably posted a
90 percent drop in profit for the second quarter on securities
valuation losses stemming from the global financial-market rout.  Net income fell to about 300 million yen ($3.9 million) in
the three months ended Sept. 30 from 3 billion yen a year
earlier, according to a preliminary earnings statement released
by Tokyo-based Shinsei today.  Shinsei will recognize 6.6 billion yen of losses on the
value of securities last quarter, it said in the statement.
Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average tumbled 11 percent in the
period, its worst performance since the three months ended June
2010, amid concern the  U.S. economy  is slowing and Europe’s debt
crisis will spill over into the banking system.  Shinsei probably posted profit of 18.5 billion yen for the
fiscal first half, a 9.6 percent increase from a year earlier,
it said today. Of the total, 18.2 billion yen was earned in the
quarter ended June 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
