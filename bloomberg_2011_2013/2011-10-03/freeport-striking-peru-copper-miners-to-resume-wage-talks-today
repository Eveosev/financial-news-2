Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) ’s
Peruvian copper miners were scheduled to resume wage talks today
as a strike entered its fifth day, while protesting workers in
 Indonesia  rejected a government-proposed salary rise.  Workers at Freeport’s  Sociedad Minera Cerro Verde SAA (CVERDEC1)  unit,
who walked off the job at Peru’s third-largest copper producer
on Sept. 29, planned to take part in government-brokered
negotiations at 11 a.m. New York time today in the city of
Arequipa, 750 kilometers (466 miles) southeast of  Lima , union
official William Camacho said.  “Talks made no progress on Friday,” Camacho said
yesterday from Arequipa. “We plan to ask the Labor Ministry to
set a one-year wage increase as there’s no point in discussing a
long-term accord under these conditions.”  Workers in  Peru ,  Chile , Bolivia and Indonesia have gone on
strike at copper, gold and zinc mines this year, seeking
improved working conditions and a bigger slice of record
profits. Cerro Verde was shut for five days by stoppages last
month, while a strike started at Freeport’s Grasberg mine in
Indonesia on Sept. 15, raising concerns that a global metal
deficit may widen and boost prices.  Cerro Verde “isn’t facing production losses,” Chief
Executive Officer Richard Adkerson said in an interview today in
London. The mine, which produced 312,336 metric tons of copper
last year, is operating at 20 percent of capacity, according to
the union.  Grasberg miners Oct. 1 turned down a government-proposed 25
percent salary increase, Freeport’s condition for resuming
negotiations. Workers are seeking to raise wages to $35 to $200
an hour from the current $1.50 to $3.50.  “The financial consequences are adverse and significant to
all the parties involved,” Adkerson said. “We think our being
willing to pay very attractive wages will ultimately lead to a
resolution of the strike.”  Freeport dropped 2.8 percent to $30.45 on Sept. 30 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.  Copper for December delivery fell 9.4 cents, or 2.9
percent, to $3.152 a pound on Sept. 30 on the Comex. On the
 London  Metal Exchange, copper dropped $234, or 3.3 percent, to
$6,784.50 a ton at 9:08 a.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
