Luxembourg Finance Minister Luc
Frieden said “all options” are on the table regarding  Dexia SA (DEXB) 
and that France, Belgium and Luxembourg will do all that is 
needed for the bank.  “I can assure you that the governments of the three
countries will take whatever steps are necessary to make sure
that the clients and the employees of Dexia can have trust in
that bank, as we did in 2008,” Frieden said in an interview
with Bloomberg Television today in Luxembourg. “All options are
on the table in a constructive manner to make sure that the bank
in whole or in part will remain a very serious financial
institution.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
