The rout that erased $2.9 trillion
from U.S. equities has pushed valuations in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index 25 percent below the average level from the
last nine recessions, even as profit estimates fall.  Companies in the benchmark gauge for American equities
trade at 10.2 times 2012 forecast earnings, compared with the
average in economic contractions since 1957 of 13.7, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. At the same time, analysts have
cut projections for profits next year by 2.6 percent to $110.78
a share, the biggest eight-week drop since 2009, the data show.  Bears say analysts have just started paring earnings
estimates and that shares will prove expensive when gross
domestic product shrinks. Bulls say stock prices have fallen so
much that even should earnings fail to increase in 2012,
equities are inexpensive.  “What you’re seeing is a growth scare,” Wayne Lin, a
 money manager  at Baltimore-based Legg Mason Inc., said in a
telephone interview on Sept. 29. His firm oversaw $643 billion
as of Aug. 31. “The question is, how much of that is priced in.
I’d say that if we don’t have a double-dip recession, if
earnings just stay flat, these valuations are reasonable. The
market already expects those downgrades.”  Chinese Manufacturing  The S&P 500 fell 2.9 percent to 1,099.23 today. The U.S.
benchmark gauge slipped 0.4 percent last week, extending its
decline since July 22 to 16 percent, after reports showing
Chinese manufacturing shrank and retail sales in  Germany  slumped
fueled concern global growth is slowing. The index had climbed
67 percent since March 2009, with 455 of its members higher than
their level at the bottom of the  bear market .  Concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will trigger a global
recession spurred investors to seek safety in the dollar and
Treasuries during the third quarter. The U.S. currency’s 5.7
percent increase was topped only by U.S. bonds, which rallied
6.4 percent, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s U.S.
Treasury Master Index data. The S&P 500 tumbled 14 percent, the
most since 2008, and the S&P GSCI Total Return Index of
commodities lost 12 percent.  Analysts have slashed forecasts for 2012 earnings to the
lowest level since April, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Projections have been falling for companies from  JPMorgan Chase
& Co. (JPM)  to  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  since S&P stripped the U.S. of its AAA
credit rating on Aug. 5.  Credit Crisis  The downgrades will get worse, according to Thomas O’Halloran, a  Jersey City , New Jersey-based money manager at
Lord Abbett & Co., which oversaw about $114 billion as of June
30. O’Halloran said profits will decrease by at least 15 percent
in 2012 from this year. The average forecast of Wall Street
analysts shows earnings will climb 17 percent to a record $99.17
a share this year and increase in 2012, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Analysts underestimated the credit crisis that began in
2007 and cut forecasts throughout 2008 when the economy
contracted. The reduction in profit estimates didn’t end until
May 2009, two months after the benchmark sank to a 12-year low,
Bloomberg data show.  “The sovereign-debt crisis is more scary than the private-
bank crisis, because the sovereign can backstop the private
sector but there is nobody to backstop the sovereign,”
O’Halloran wrote in an e-mail on Sept. 28. “We’re in an
environment where the macro is terrible. That would be the
underlining reason why the market could have further downside.”  Recession Looms  International investors expect the world economy will
relapse into a recession, with more than one in three
forecasting a global economic contraction within the next year,
according to a Bloomberg Global Poll conducted Sept. 26. More
than two in five said they’re increasing holdings of cash, the
largest proportion since the poll began asking that question in
June 2010. A majority, 56 percent, say U.S. stocks entered a
bear market.  S&P 500  profits fell an average of 12 percent on a yearly
basis in the nine recessions since the 1950s, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Should earnings drop by the same amount
from the estimated $99.17 a share this year, profits will total
$87.59 in 2012. Based on the S&P 500’s Sept. 30 close of
1,131.42, that would imply a multiple of 12.9.  ‘Second Dip’  “We’re diving into the second dip of a double-dip
recession, so how promising is it that the earnings will hold?”
 Rob Arnott , chairman and founder of Research Affiliates LLC in
 Newport Beach ,  California , said in a telephone interview on
Sept. 28. About $83 billion is managed using investment
strategies developed by his firm.  “The measures by which stocks are cheap today rely on
continued recovery and a continued surge in already peak
earnings,” Arnott said. “It relies on a very shaky
foundation.”  Economists project growth will accelerate to 2.2 percent in
2012 from 1.6 percent this year, according to a Bloomberg survey
of 66 respondents. U.S. gross domestic product expanded at a 1.3
percent pace in the second quarter, according to a Commerce
Department revision released Sept. 29.  Should S&P 500 earnings hold at $99 a share next year,
stocks would be trading at a 30 percent discount to the average
multiple since 1954, according to Bloomberg data. The index is
priced at 12 times earnings in the last 12 months, down from a
high of 23.9 in December 2009.  Train Wreck  Companies exceeded income forecasts in the last nine
quarters after cutting costs and lowering debt. Reduced
estimates mean corporations will have an easier time extending
the streak, said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist for
the mutual-fund division at Wells Fargo Asset Management. Unlike
2008, when the bankruptcy by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. came
as a shock, the market is anticipating a recession and the
pessimism is overdone, he said.  “The current crisis seems almost like a train wreck that
everybody is witnessing,” Jacobsen, who is based in  San
Francisco , said in a telephone interview on Sept. 29. His firm
oversees more than $400 billion. “That’s one of the reasons why
I think we’ll avoid a train wreck. Policy makers know what the
issues are. They just have to come to an agreement.”  Twenty-two of the 31 analysts who follow JPMorgan slashed
their 2012 earnings projections in the past four weeks, and none
raised them, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The New York-based
bank is trading at 5.42 times next year’s earnings of $5.29 a
share. That’s 47 percent lower than the average multiple since
2004, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Caterpillar  The average profit estimate for Caterpillar, the largest
maker of construction and mining equipment, fell by 36 cents to
$8.86 a share in the past four weeks, according to a Bloomberg
survey of 21 analysts. Shares of the Peoria, Illinois-based
company are trading at 7.97 times 2012 earnings, 40 percent
below the average valuation since 2005, Bloomberg data show.  Matt Peron, head of active equity at Northern Trust Corp.
in  Chicago , said the economy will avoid a recession.  “Estimates will come down a fair amount, but I don’t think
they’ll fall to something like an $85 level,” he said in a
Sept. 29 interview. His firm manages $684 billion. “If they
don’t, there’ll be a relief rally or the market will at least
grind higher when it realizes it’s been pricing in too low of a
number.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
