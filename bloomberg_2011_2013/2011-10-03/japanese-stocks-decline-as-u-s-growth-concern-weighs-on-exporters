Japanese stocks fell, with the  Nikkei
225 (NKY)  Stock Average dropping the most in a week, after U.S.
consumer spending slowed and incomes unexpectedly declined in
the world’s biggest economy, damping the earnings outlook for
Asia’s exporters.  Sony Corp. (6758) ,  Japan ’s biggest exporter of consumer
electronics, plunged 4.5 percent.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , which
counts  North America  as its largest market, slipped 2 percent.
 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s No. 1 lender by
market value, fell 2.8 percent. Mitsubishi Corp., the country’s
top trading company, lost .4.8 percent after oil and metal
prices slumped.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 1.8 percent to 8,545.48
at the 3 p.m. close of trading in  Tokyo . The measure tumbled 11
percent last quarter, its worst performance since the three
months ended June 2010, amid concern the  U.S. economy  is slowing
and  Europe ’s debt crisis will spill over into the banking system.
The Topix lost 1.9 percent to 747.11 today.  “Sentiment has gotten so bad that investors easily respond
to any sort of negative news,” said  Ayako Sera , a market
strategist in Tokyo at Sumitomo Trust & Banking Co., which
manages the equivalent of $323 billion. “There’s concern that
overseas demand will shrink. So stocks sensitive to the global
economy are declining.”  S&P Futures  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.9 percent
today. The index fell 2.5 percent on Sept. 30 in  New York ,
sending the measure to its biggest quarterly drop since 2008,
after reports from China and Germany fueled concern the global
economy is slowing.  Consumer spending  in the U.S. slowed in August as incomes
unexpectedly dropped for the first time in almost two years.
Purchases rose 0.2 percent after a 0.7 percent increase in July,
Commerce Department figures showed on Sept. 30. Economists had
forecast incomes would rise 0.1 percent, according to a
Bloomberg survey.  Sony, which fell to its lowest intraday level since 1987
today, finished down 4.5 percent at 1,439 yen. Toyota, the
world’s biggest carmaker, fell 2 percent to 2,635 yen.
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial lost 2.8 percent to 344 yen.  Japanese stocks fell even after the Bank of Japan’s
quarterly Tankan index of sentiment at large manufacturers rose
to 2 in September from minus 9 in June, matching the median
estimate of 23 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. A positive
number means optimists outnumber pessimists.  Eyes on America  “The Tankan results were in-line with expectations, so
it’s not really affecting stocks,” said Sumitomo Trust’s Sera.
“Stocks are reacting more to what happened in America.”  Japanese trading companies extended last week’s declines
after the prices of oil and metals dropped further. The Topix
Wholesale Trade Index lost 4.5 percent after tumbling 3.4
percent last week.  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , which gets about 43 percent of its
revenue from commodities, lost 4.8 percent to 1,516 yen. Smaller
Mitsui & Co. slumped 5.3 percent to 1,074 yen.  Inpex Corp. (1605) ,
Japan’s No. 1 energy explorer, dropped 2.4 percent to 472,500
yen.  Oil fell today from a one year-low in New York, extending
declines after the worst quarter since 2008. Crude for November
slid as much as 1.6 percent in electronic trading in New York.
Prices on the London Metal Exchange fell 3.4 percent on Sept. 30.  Shipping Companies Fall  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. led shipping companies lower after
reporting that profit fell. Japan’s second-biggest shipper fell
7 percent to 279 yen, its lowest close since March 2003. The
company lost 17 billion yen in the six months ended Sept. 30,
missing a profit forecast of 1 billion yen, according to a
preliminary earnings statement that cited a decline in freight
rates and a stronger yen.  Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd. (5802) , one of the world’s
biggest makers of wire harnesses, plunged after smaller
Furukawa Electric Co. last week agreed to plead guilty and pay a
$200 million U.S. fine for a price-fixing and bid-rigging
conspiracy involving the sale of parts to automakers.  Sumitomo Electric plunged 11 percent to 809 yen, the
biggest drop on the Topix index. Furukawa, which was cut to
“neutral” from “overweight” by JPMorgan Chase & Co., lost 7
percent to 198 yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
