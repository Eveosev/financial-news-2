Dexia SA (DEXB) , the lender bailed out by
France and  Belgium  in 2008, had the ratings of its three main
operating units put on review for downgrade at Moody’s Investors
Service on concern the bank is struggling to fund itself.  Moody’s put the long term deposit and debt ratings and the
short-term ratings of Dexia Bank Belgium, Dexia Credit Local and
Dexia Banque Internationale a Luxembourg on review for
downgrade, the ratings company said in a statement today. The
stock fell as much as 14 percent, the steepest decline in the
46-member Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services Index.  Dexia posted a 4.03 billion-euro ($5.3 billion) second-
quarter loss, the largest in its history as it wrote down its
holdings of Greek debt. The Brussels-based lender said on Aug. 4
that U.S. investors’ concern about the European sovereign debt
crisis had limited its ability to borrow dollars in the money
market. Dexia’s reliance on emergency central bank funding
doubled to about 34 billion euros in the second quarter.  “Dexia has experienced further tightening in its access to
market funding,” Moody’s said. “Dexia’s collateral postings
have increased due to substantial market volatility.”  The stock was down 12 cents, or 8 percent, at 1.33 euros by
10:51 a.m. in Brussels trading, giving the bank a market value
of about 2.6 billion euros. The shares have fallen 46 percent
this year. Dexia spokesman Benoit Gausseron declined to comment
on Moody’s review.  To contact the reporter on this story:
