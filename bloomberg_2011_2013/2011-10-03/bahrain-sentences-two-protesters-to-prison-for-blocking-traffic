A Bahraini court sentenced two people
to three months in prison and fined each 100 dinars ($265) for
blocking traffic as part of an anti-government protest called by
the mainly Shiite opposition.  Cases against several other people involved in the Sept. 21
and Sept. 26 incidents are under way in the Traffic Misdemeanor
Court, the state-run Bahrain News Agency reported, citing
traffic prosecutor Hussain Al-Buali. The opposition has been
calling on Bahrainis to block traffic in the capital Manama and
its suburbs during rush hour tomorrow.  Bahraini authorities detained hundreds of people, most of
them Shiites, following a crackdown on protesters who held
rallies in February and March to demand a more representative
government. At least 35 people were killed during the clashes.
Shiites represent about 70 percent of Bahrainâ€™s population,
according to the U.S. State Department, while its hereditary
rulers are Sunni.  To contact the reporter on this story:
