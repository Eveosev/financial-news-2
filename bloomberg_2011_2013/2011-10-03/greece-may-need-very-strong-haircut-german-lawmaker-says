Michael Fuchs , the Christian
Democratic Union’s deputy leader in Germany’s parliament, said
that he doesn’t think that it is possible that  Greece  will be
able to repay all its debts.  “I think it will not be possible that Greece is capable to
pay back,” all its debts, said Fuchs in an interview with
Dublin-based broadcaster RTE today. “So there must be a very
very strong haircut which is necessary.”  Fuchs said he isn’t “convinced” that Greece’s bailout
partners will pay the next tranche in loans to the country.  “We are close to a haircut and there must be some
solution. The solution cannot be that we just struggle around
all the time, so it is better to say so up front,” Fuchs said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
