Forex Capital Markets LLC agreed to
pay $14.2 million to settle U.S. regulators’ claims it failed to
properly oversee handling of more than 57,000 accounts that used
the New York-based firm’s foreign-exchange trading platform.  FXCM, between 2008 and 2010, deprived customers of $8.26
million in “positive price slippage,” advantageous price
changes that occurred after the clients placed orders and before
the transaction was executed, the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission said in an administrative order filed today. The firm
agreed to reimburse the damages and to pay a $6 million penalty,
the CFTC said.  FXCM had agreed in August to pay restitution to the
customers in a settlement with the  National Futures Association ,
which also imposed a $2 million penalty. As part of today’s
settlement with the CFTC, the firm agreed to retain a monitor
for its trade-execution practices.  While customers didn’t receive the benefit of positive
price slippage, they did absorb losses from negative movements,
the CFTC said. The CFTC faulted the firm for failing to
supervise employees’ handling of market orders and margin
liquidation orders, according to the administrative order.  “FXCM has previously enhanced its execution system to pass
along all price improvements on every order type,” Drew Niv,
the firm’s chief executive officer, said in a statement today.
“We are happy to have settled all our regulatory matters in the
U.S., to have this behind us and to see this come to an end.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
