Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk
sees “only” five ministers from the current government in the
one that will be formed after the Oct. 9 parliamentary vote,
according to the Polish edition of  Newsweek .  “Although I have a high opinion of all my ministers, I
don’t think more than five of them will be able to continue in
their present posts,” Tusk said in an interview published
today. “This is also partly due to the fact that the government
will need to alter its priorities.”  Tusk, who didn’t specify new priorities, praised Regional
Development Minister Elzbieta Bienkowska, who “turned out a
very good minister” in helping the country use 20 billion euros
($26.7 billion) in European Union funds.  He also said that while “remaining outside of the euro
area has its pros and cons, it is in  Poland ’s longer-term
security interests to join the euro region.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
