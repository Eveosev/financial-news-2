Oil markets may be “tight” next
year as consuming countries draw on crude and product
inventories, according to the head of trader Vitol Group’s
Middle East operations.  Markets are “balanced to tight,” Vitol’s Chris Bake said
in Dubai today. While there is currently enough excess
production capacity to meet demand, prices may rise next year if
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries members don’t
boost output, he said.  Prices will also depend on how quickly  Libya  can restore
crude production after violent uprisings there and whether
economic growth strengthens, he said at the Conference
Connection’s Middle East Petroleum and Gas Conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
