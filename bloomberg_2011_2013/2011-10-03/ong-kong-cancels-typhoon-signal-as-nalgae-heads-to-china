Hong Kong  canceled all typhoon
signals and replaced them with a strong monsoon warning as
Severe Tropical Storm Nalgae, which killed at least one person
and flooded nine towns and cities in the Philippines, headed
toward  China .  The storm was estimated to be about 520 kilometers (323
miles) south of Hong Kong as of 7 p.m. local time, the Hong Kong
Observatory said in a  statement  on its  website . The typhoon
signals were canceled at 7:10 p.m.  Nalgae, was forecast to move toward the northern part of
the  South China Sea  at about 14 kilometers per hour five days
after Typhoon Nesat, the strongest to hit China this year,
prompted the city to raise its highest storm signal in two years
and shut financial markets, schools, courts and government
offices.  Disaster authorities in the  Philippines  issued their
strongest storm warning for 10 provinces as Nalgae struck the
main island of Luzon Oct. 1, four days after Nesat caused at
least 50 deaths and $137 million in damage to crops and
infrastructure in the island nation.  Nesat, which swept past Hong Kong Sept. 29, felled trees,
ripped bamboo scaffolding from buildings and forced the city’s
stock exchange to shut. It destroyed 2,200 homes, damaged 6,100
others and rendered 3,620 hectares of cropland “useless” in
China, the official Xinhua News Agency said in a Oct. 1 report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
