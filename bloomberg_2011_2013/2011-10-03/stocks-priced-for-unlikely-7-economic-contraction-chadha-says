The  U.S. economy  would have to
contract as much as 7 percent to justify current stock prices,
according to Deutsche Bank AG’s Binky Chadha.  “If you think about the forward multiple, it’s pricing in
a quarter of minus 6 to 7 percent nominal GDP growth, which is
pretty severe,” New York-based Chadha, chief U.S. equity
strategist, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “In
the Loop” with Betty Liu today.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell today within 1 percent
of the 20 percent decline that defines a  bear market  as concern
over the Greek debt crisis offset an unexpected rebound in
manufacturing and construction spending. The gauge trades for
about 12 times reported income and 9.9 times 2012 estimated
earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The U.S. economy will expand 1.8 percent in the third
quarter, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists conducted
Sept. 2 to Sept. 7. That’s down from a 2.1 percent estimate in
the August survey. Economists also cut growth projections to 2.2
percent for the final three months of this year, from a previous
estimate of 2.5 percent.  “That is not a reason for earnings to fall on the face of
it,” Chadha said. “Not only is the market pricing in something
like Lehman, but it is very much positioned for it.”  The world’s largest economy contracted by 8.9 percent in
the last three months of 2008 as the bankruptcy of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. pushed the world into the worst financial
crisis since the 1930s.  Wall Street firms say  S&P 500  profits will increase 17
percent for all of 2011 and 12 percent in 2012. S&P 500 earnings
are poised to reach a record $99.16 a share this year, according
to the average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Analysts
are more optimistic about earnings since the S&P 500 peaked at a
three-year high on April 29, driving their forecast up from
$98.73 a share that day.  Chadha estimates the S&P 500 will end 2011 at 1,425, with
companies in the index earning $99 a share. The average estimate
of 13 strategists calls for the benchmark measure to end 2011 at
1,305. The benchmark equity index slid to 1,099.23 today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
