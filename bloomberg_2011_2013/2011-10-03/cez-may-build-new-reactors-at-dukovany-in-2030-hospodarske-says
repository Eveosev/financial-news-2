CEZ AS (CEZ) , the  Czech Republic ’s biggest
power producer, may build new reactors at the Dukovany nuclear
plant in about 2030,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported, citing an
interview with Chief Executive Officer Daniel Benes.  The Czech Republic will probably build a new nuclear power
plant at some point after 2030, though such a project isn’t
included in CEZ’s strategic plans, the newspaper cited Benes as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
