The  European Central Bank  said
financial institutions increased overnight deposits to the
highest in more than a year.  Banks parked 199.6 billion euros ($266 billion) with the
ECB on Sept. 30, up from 161.4 billion euros a day earlier,
according to data published by the Frankfurt-based central bank
today. That’s the highest since July 2010. Overnight borrowing
at the marginal rate of 2.25 percent almost doubled to 1.4
billion euros from 765 million euros, it said.  Banks are borrowing more from the ECB in regular
refinancing operations as the region’s debt crisis intensifies,
leaving lenders with excess cash that they return to the central
bank in overnight deposits rather than pass it on to other
institutions. Banks tend to front-load their ECB borrowings to
ensure they have enough cash to meet reserve maintenance
requirements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
