European Union subsidies totaling 2.9
billion euros ($3.8 billion) to  Greece , Portugal, Ireland,
Latvia, Romania and Hungary may be cut by at least 50 percent
after some EU countries voiced concern about the effect on their
own public finances, the Financial Times reported, citing
unidentified diplomats.  The six countries are due to receive the money as part of a
European Commission plan to quicken subsidy payments to
countries that have received bailouts during the crisis, the
newspaper said.  A group of countries led by net contributors to the EU
budget, including  France , the U.K., the Netherlands and the
Nordic nations, are questioning the arrangement, the FT said.  The commission wants to lower to a little as 5 percent the
proportion of costs borne by national governments in projects
otherwise funded by the EU, and to make the arrangement
retrospective to the time when countries began receiving
international aid, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
