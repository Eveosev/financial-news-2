Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter said euro-region experts are working on measures to
strengthen the European Financial Stability Facility,  Die Welt 
reported, citing an interview.  Fekter said “experts” are considering “how to strengthen
the EFSF through leverage or other measures,” according to the
report.  She declined to elaborate on what the leverage could look
like and said that higher EFSF guarantees are not being
discussed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
