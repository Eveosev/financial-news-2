The  Milwaukee Brewers  beat the
Arizona Diamondbacks 9-4 to take a two-games-to-none lead in
their Major League Baseball first-round playoff series.  The Brewers scored five runs in the sixth inning to snap a
4-4 tie at Miller Park in  Milwaukee .  The best-of-five National League Division Series now shifts
to Phoenix for Game 3 on Oct. 4. The Brewers hold a 2-0 lead in
a postseason series for the first time and can advance to the NL
Championship Series with one more win.  The  Detroit Tigers  defeated the New York Yankees 5-3
earlier today to tie their American League playoff series at one
game apiece.  Miguel Cabrera  drove in three runs for the Tigers,
while Max Scherzer took a shutout into the seventh inning at
Yankee Stadium in  New York .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
