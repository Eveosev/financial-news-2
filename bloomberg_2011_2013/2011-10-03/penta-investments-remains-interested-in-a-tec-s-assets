Penta Investments Ltd., a Czech and
Slovak private equity group, remains “interested” in assets of
 A-Tec Industries AG (ATEC) , a bankrupt Austrian engineering group, in
case they are sold by the administrator.  “We definitely want to stay in the game if there’s a
sale,” Penta’s spokesman Martin Danko said by phone in Prague
today. “The sale conditions would determine what assets
specifically we would be interested in.”  A-Tec Industries yesterday said its administrator Matthias
Schmidt had exercised his right to start liquidating the group
after it failed to raise funds required under a restructuring
agreed with creditors last year.  The administrator will seek to sell all of A-Tec’s assets
and pay out the proceeds exclusively to creditors, Vienna-based
A-Tec said in a statement.  Penta had negotiated with A-Tec in September to buy assets
directly from the company but the talks failed, Penta said on
Sept. 30.  The Wiener Boerse also today suspended trading of A-Tec
shares indefinitely.  To contact the reporter on this story:
