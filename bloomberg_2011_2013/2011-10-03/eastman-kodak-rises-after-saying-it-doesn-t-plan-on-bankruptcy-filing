Eastman Kodak Co. (EK) , the unprofitable
131-year-old camera company, climbed the most since at least
1974 after saying it doesn’t plan to seek  bankruptcy protection .  The shares advanced 56 cents, or 72 percent, to $1.34 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading,
recovering from a drop of 54 percent Sept. 30.  Kodak will make a coupon payment today, spokesman Gerard
Meuchner said today in an e-mail. The Rochester, New York-based
company said Sept. 30 it had “no intention” of filing for
bankruptcy protection.  Kodak, which has lost money for three straight years as it
tries to transform into a digital printing and imaging company,
is weighing options including a bankruptcy filing because of
concerns raised by possible buyers of its patent portfolio, said
three people with direct knowledge of the process.  Some potential bidders for the patents are wary of
proceeding because a purchase may amount to a so-called
fraudulent transfer if Kodak is insolvent, said the people, who
asked not to be named because the talks are private. Kodak
confirmed Sept. 30 it hired  Jones Day  to advise it on options.  To contact the reporter on this story:
