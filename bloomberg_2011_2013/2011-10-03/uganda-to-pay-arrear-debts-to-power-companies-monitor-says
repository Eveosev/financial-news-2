The Ugandan government will start
paying arrear debts of more than 207.5 billion shillings ($72.6
million) to independent power companies, the  Daily Monitor  said,
citing energy minister Irene Muloni.  Companies such as  Aggreko Plc (AGK) , Jacobsen Elektro AS’s
Ugandan unit and Electro-Maxx reduced output after they weren’t
paid by the Ugandan government, the Kampala-based Monitor said.
The arrears are part of 663.4 billion shillings in subsidies due
to electricity suppliers during fiscal 2012, it said.  The east African nation, which needs about 445 megawatts of
power and generates about 334 megawatts, had to ration power
after producers cut output, the Monitor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
