India , the world’s second-largest
wheat producer, may increase the minimum price at which the
state buys grain from farmers by 15 percent, said two government
officials with direct knowledge of the proposal.  The farm ministry recommended a price of 1,350 rupees
($27.40) for 100 kilograms (220 pounds) of wheat to be paid to
the growers for the marketing year that begins April 1, from
1,170 rupees this year, said the officials, who declined to be
identified because the plan has yet to be approved.  The cabinet may consider the proposal later this month,
said the officials. Manoj Pandey, a spokesman for the farm
ministry, didn’t answer two calls made to his office and mobile
phones today.  India’s government is the biggest buyer of food crops,
purchasing them at guaranteed prices from farmers and selling
them to people on low incomes at subsidized rates through state-
run shops. The guaranteed prices are intended to protect farmers
from forced sales at low rates on the open market.  To contact the reporters on this story:
