Peru ’s benchmark borrowing costs in
dollars rose to the highest level in two years as Germany damped
speculation of a breakthrough in talks to contain Europe’s debt
crisis, curbing demand for emerging-market assets.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian government
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries rose 17 basis points, or 0.17
percentage point, to 296 at 4:36 p.m. New York time, according
to JPMorgan Chase & Co. That’s the widest differential since
July 2009.  German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said he opposed
moves to further boost the rescue fund designed to shore up
liquidity in the euro area. Greece passed measures to cut its
budget deficit that missed previous goals set as part of bailout
conditions. Emerging-market stocks fell after completing their
worst quarterly drop since 2008.  “Higher  risk aversion  is being priced in” to Peru’s
financial assets, said Roberto Melzi, a Latin America strategist
at Barclays Capital Inc. in New York.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose two basis points to 5.93
percent, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  The sol weakened 0.1 percent to 2.7745 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 2.7725 on Sept. 30.  The central bank sold $38 million in the  currency market 
today to slow declines in the sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
