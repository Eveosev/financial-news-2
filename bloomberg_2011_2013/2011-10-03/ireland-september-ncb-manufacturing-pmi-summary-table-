Markit Economics today released the September
NCB Stockbrokers manufacturing purchasing managersâ€™ index for
Ireland. The Manufacturing PMI is designed to provide a single figure
snap-shot for Irish manufacturing. It is based on a survey of
companies in the  Republic of Ireland  manufacturing sector and is
designed to provide the most up-to-date picture of business conditions in the
private manufacturing sector. Anything above 50 indicates expansion; below
50, a contraction. The greater the divergence from 50, the
greater the rate of change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
