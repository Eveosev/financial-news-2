50 rankings for the first time since October 1996 as the
American continues to struggle to return from injury.  Woods is ranked 51st this week, according to the Official
World Golf Rankings released today. He spent 780 weeks in the
top 50, the Virginia Water, England-based  rankings organization

Tournament.  England’s Luke Donald and Lee Westwood were first and
second in the rankings, with Rory McIlroy in third.  Steve Stricker  ranked fourth, making him the top American.  To contact the reporter on this story:
