OAO Sberbank,  Russia ’s biggest
lender, declined to its lowest in over a year as the country’s
currency continued its slide against the dollar.  The stock slipped 3.1 percent to 68.34 rubles by the close
in Moscow, the weakest since May 2010. The ruble fell 1.1
percent to 32.595 per dollar.  A weaker ruble encourages Russians to withdraw and convert
ruble deposits, Sberbank’s main source of funding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
