Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) , Asia’s third-
biggest maker of  wind turbines , said its Seforge unit won new
orders valued at 2 billion rupees ($40.4 million) to supply
parts used to erect the machines.  Seforge will supply 1.2 billion rupees of tower flanges and
800 million rupees of castings, Suzlon said today in a
statement. It didn’t identify the customers.  The forged rings that Seforge makes are also used in the
oil and gas industry, and the company expects increasing orders
from those businesses, it said. As much as 20 percent of its
forging division’s revenue may come from the oil and gas
industry in the financial year beginning April, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
