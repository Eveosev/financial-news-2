Canadian natural gas fell as mild
weather eased demand for the power plant fuel to run air
conditioners and as storage increased in preparation for winter
heating requirements.  Prices, which usually follow their U.S. counterparts on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , dropped 1.3 percent as MDA
EarthSat Weather of Gaithersburg, Maryland, said temperatures
along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts would be 3 degrees to 14
degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees to 8 degrees Celsius) below normal
this week and would be normal to below-average across the West
by Oct. 17.  “It’s pretty mild weather out west,”  Peter Linder ,
president of the DeltaOne Energy Fund in Calgary, said in a
telephone interview. “It’s a shoulder month transitioning
between the seasons, and with the weaker  U.S. economy , storage
levels will not be as positive as they have been through the
summer.”  Alberta gas for November delivery fell 4.5 cents to C$3.33
per gigajoule ($3.01 per million Btu) as of 3:15 p.m. New York
time, while December gas was down 3.25 cents to C$3.59,
according to  NGX,  a Canadian Internet market. Gas traded on the
exchange is shipped to users in  Canada  and the U.S. and is
priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.  Gas for November delivery on the Nymex dropped 4.9 cents to
settle at $3.617 per million Btu.  Flow Rates  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near  Chicago 
declined 2.74 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $3.6605 per million Btu
on the  Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line
that can carry about 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the Midwest
from western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas dropped 10.74 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $3.3989,
according to ICE.  At Malin, Oregon, where Canadian gas is traded for
California markets, gas fell 12.54 cents to $3.4858 per million
Btu.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta  system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.3 billion cubic
feet, 500 million above the target, as of 2 p.m. New York time.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.57 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.8 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 641 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.45 billion cubic feet today, about 69 percent of its
capacity of 2.09 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.87
billion cubic feet at 2:05 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
