Iceland’s  National Energy Authority 
announced the start of its second round for oil and natural gas
exploration licenses in the Dreki Area off the island’s
northeastern coast.  The deadline for applications is April 2, the Reykjavik-
based agency said today in a  statement .  “Seismic surveys and other geophysical measurements
indicate that oil and gas could be found in the Dreki Area as
they have been in adjacent and geologically similar areas,” the
authority said. “Further research, including exploratory
drilling, is necessary to verify whether oil or gas exists in
the Dreki Area.”  The first licensing round for exploration was derailed in
2009, when four companies pulled out. The country has offered
blocks in a 42,700 square kilometer (16,500 square mile) area,
partially in Icelandic territorial waters and partially in
Norwegian waters. Each country is entitled to a 25 percent stake
in discoveries made in the other’s section.  Oil and gas producers have been seeking untapped reserves
in the world’s northernmost regions as deposits in more
hospitable climates mature and governments restrict access. The
Arctic may hold 90 billion barrels of oil, more than the
combined known reserves of Nigeria, Kazakhstan and  Mexico , the
 U.S. Geological Survey  said in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
