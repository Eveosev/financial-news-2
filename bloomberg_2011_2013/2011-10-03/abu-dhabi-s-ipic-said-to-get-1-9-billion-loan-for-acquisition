International Petroleum Investment
Co., an Abu Dhabi government-controlled investor, borrowed $1.9
billion from  Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC (ADCB) , two bankers
familiar with the transaction said.  IPIC, as the company is known, will use the money to fund
the acquisition by subsidiary Aabar Investments PJSC of a 24.9
percent stake in Malaysian lender  RHB Capital Bhd (RHBC) , the bankers
said, declining to be identified because the information is
private. Aabar announced the purchase of the RHB stake from ADCB
for 5.9 billion ringgit ($1.9 billion) in June.  State-controlled ADCB “declines to make any statement on
loans extended to our customers,” the bank said in an e-mailed
response to questions from Bloomberg News. “Appropriate
disclosure regarding all loans and advances can be found in our
balance sheet.” Reuters reported the story earlier today.  IPIC and Aabar didn’t respond to e-mails seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
