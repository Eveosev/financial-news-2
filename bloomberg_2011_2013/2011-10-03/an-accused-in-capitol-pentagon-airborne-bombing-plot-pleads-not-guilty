A  Massachusetts  man pleaded not
guilty to charges that he plotted to bomb the U.S. Capitol and
the Pentagon using remote-controlled aircraft.  Rezwan Ferdaus, 26, will be held without bail until a
hearing on Oct. 20 to consider whether he should be released
while awaiting trial and requirements for bail, U.S. Magistrate
Judge Timothy Hillman said at a plea hearing today in federal
court in Worcester, Massachusetts.  “The charges are very serious and we need time to
prepare,” Ferdaus’s lawyer, Catherine Byrne, said in court.  The charges include attempting to damage and destroy a
federal building and national defense premises, attempting to
provide material support to terrorists and a designated foreign
terrorists organization and receipt of explosive materials and
nonregistered firearms.  The case is U.S. v. Ferdaus, 11-10331, U.S. District Court,
District of Massachusetts (Boston).  To contact the reporter on this story:
