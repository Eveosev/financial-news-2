U.S. stocks and commodities recovered
from early losses amid better-than-estimated American economic
data and progress toward resolving an obstacle to  Greece ’s
bailout. The euro slumped to a 10-year low versus the yen.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed at
1,130.92 at 11:57 a.m. in  New York  after slumping as much as 0.9
percent earlier. The S&P GSCI Index of raw materials rose 0.3
percent, recovering from a 1.8 percent early drop.  European governments are close to resolving Finland’s
demand for collateral to underpin bailout loans, removing an
obstacle to Greece’s second rescue package, three people
familiar with the discussion said. In the U.S., data on
manufacturing and construction spending topped estimates.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
