Royal Bank of Scotland Plc said it
now expects the  European Central Bank  to lower its benchmark
interest rate by 25 basis points, when council members meet on
Oct. 6, instead of a previously forecast 50 basis points.  “We believe the 3 percent inflation print came at the
wrong time and will likely strengthen the case for those on the
council preferring at this stage to focus only on additional
non-standard measures,” RBS economists including  Jacques
Cailloux  in London said in an e-mailed statement today. Still,
“we remain confident that the environment warrants a larger
rate cut.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
