Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  fell to
its lowest close since 2009, on concern  China’s economy  is
slowing and after U.S.  consumer spending  weakened amid a drop in
incomes in the world’s largest economy.  Techtronic Industries Co. (669) , maker of Ryobi power tools that
counts  North America  as its largest market, sank 8.3 percent.
Ping An Insurance Group Co.,  China ’s No. 2 insurance company by
market value, tumbled 13 percent. Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s No.
1 producer of the metal by market value, dropped 12 percent
after commodity prices declined. Macau casino operator  Galaxy
Entertainment Group Ltd. (27)  tumbled 19 percent on concern growth
will slow.  The Hang Seng Index fell 4.4 percent to 16,822.15, its
lowest close since May 2009. All but four stocks retreated in
the 46-member gauge, which last week capped its worst quarterly
loss in a decade. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of
Chinese companies listed in  Hong Kong  declined 5.7 percent to
8,408.26. The gauge tumbled 12 percent last week, after a
manufacturing gauge contracted for a third month.  “When the macro environment is bad, it negatively affects
the micro environment in Hong Kong,” said Francis Lun, managing
director at Lyncean Holdings Ltd., an investment holding company
in Hong Kong. “Investors are trying to get out of the stock
market and wait for it to bottom out.”  Worst Since 2001  The Hang Seng Index last week posted its steepest quarterly
drop since the three months ended September 2001, when terrorist
attacks in the U.S. sent global markets tumbling. The benchmark
was the second-worst performer among developed markets as
Chinese banks and developers tumbled, and amid concern that
global economies may enter a recession. Shares on the index
traded at 9 times forecast earnings at the last close, compared
with 11.4 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Techtronic sank 8.3 percent to HK$4.85. Li & Fung Ltd., a
supplier of clothes and toys to retailers including Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., retreated 5.9 percent to HK$12.44.  HSBC Holdings
Plc (5) , the U.K.-based lender that made a fifth of its revenue in
North America last year, slid 4.2 percent to HK$58.35.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.4
percent today. In  New York , the index fell 2.5 percent on Sept.
30, sending the measure to its biggest quarterly drop since 2008,
after reports from China and Germany fueled concerns the global
economy is slowing.  U.S. Spending  Consumer spending in the U.S. slowed in August as incomes
unexpectedly dropped for the first time in almost two years,
forcing households to dip into savings. Purchases rose 0.2
percent after a 0.7 percent increase in July, Commerce
Department figures showed on Sept. 30. Incomes decreased 0.1
percent, the first decline since October 2009. Economists had
forecast incomes would rise 0.1 percent, according to a
Bloomberg survey.  In China last week, the purchasing managers’ index,
released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics, showed a
reading of 49.9 for September, unchanged from August.  “Economic indicators are suggesting that the economy in
mainland China is slowing,” said Linus Yip, chief strategist at
First Shanghai Securities in Hong Kong. Concerns of slowing
liquidity in banks are dragging down financial and property
stocks, he said.  Ping An tumbled 13 percent to HK$38.30, while China
Minsheng Banking Corp. retreated 10 percent to HK$4.29.  Agile
Property Holdings Ltd. (3383) , which develops properties in the
Guangdong province, sank 18 percent to HK$4.21.  China Overseas
Land & Investment Ltd. (688) , a developer controlled by the nation’s
construction ministry, dropped 11 percent to HK$10.06.  Slowdown in China  The Purchasing Managers’ Index published Oct. 1 by the
China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing rose for a second
month, to 51.2. Readings above 50 signal expansion.  “The number that came out over the weekend isn’t all that
good,” Louis Kuijs, Hong Kong-based chief Asia economist at MF
Global Holdings Ltd., said today on Bloomberg television. “If
you adjust for seasonal effects there has been some decline in
the overall number. That is indicating in my mind that China’s
economy is still growing, but we are seeing a slowdown.”  Developers also slid after Yifan Hu, Haitong International
Research Ltd.’s head of research and chief economist, said about
half of China’s commercial real-estate companies may be forced
to stop operating in the next three to five years as the
government tightens housing-market policies.  Galaxy Entertainment  tumbled 19 percent to HK$9.42. Sands
China Ltd., a Macau casino operator, sank 14 percent to HK$15.98,
while  Wynn Macau Ltd. (1128) , a unit of the casino operator founded by
billionaire  Steve Wynn , slid 11 percent to HK$16.74.  Investors ‘Afraid’  Macau casinos are being hurt by speculation that steps by
the Chinese government to tighten credit are leaving VIP
gamblers with less cash to play with, Philip Tulk, head of Asian
conglomerates and gaming research at Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc., said in an interview in Hong Kong.  “People are afraid and selling their winners,” Tulk said.
“In this kind of market, anything that’s up gets sold. It’s
like a whack-o-mole.”  Cnooc Ltd. (883)  China’s largest offshore oil producer, fell 6.5
percent to HK$12.16. PetroChina Co., the nation’s No. 1 oil
company by market value, slid 2.5 percent to HK$9.43. Jiangxi
Copper plunged 12 percent to HK$12.18. Minmetals Resources Ltd.,
a copper and alumina producer, slumped 10 percent to HK$2.67.  Oil prices  fell today, extending declines after the worst
quarter since 2008. Crude for November slid as much as 2.3
percent in electronic trading in the New York. A measure of
primary metals traded in  London  fell 3.4 percent on Sept. 30,
when copper futures declined for a third straight quarter.  Railway Shares Drop  Railway-related shares declined after 21st Century Business
Herald reported China postponed construction of 80 percent of
its railway projects, pending clarification of government
policies, citing an unidentified person close to the railway
ministry. CSR Corp., a mainland maker of railway equipment,
tumbled 13 percent to HK$2.45.  China Railway Group Ltd. (390) , a
builder of the nation’s railroads, fell 1.9 percent to HK$1.55.  Among other stocks that fell, Yanzhou Coal Mining Co.,
China’s fourth-biggest coal producer, sank 14 percent to
HK$14.68 after it obtained government approvals to acquire
Canadian potash exploration permits for $260 million.  “Investors certainly do not like it when Yanzhou said it’s
entering a field that the company is not familiar with or has
experience in,” said Lawrence Lau, a Hong Kong-based analyst at
Bank of China Ltd. “Potash is not even remotely part of Yanzhou
Coal’s core business.”  Futures on the Hang Seng Index slid 3 percent to 16,897.
The HSI Volatility Index gained 2.9 percent to 44, indicating
options traders expect a swing of 12.6 percent in the Hang Seng
Index in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
