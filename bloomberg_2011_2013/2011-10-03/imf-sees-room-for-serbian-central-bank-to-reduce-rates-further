Serbia  has room to cut  interest rates 
more as inflationary pressures ease, the National Bank of Serbia
said today, citing the  International Monetary Fund .  Any loosening of monetary policy should be “gradual” and
“cautious,” the Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije said,
citing an IMF press release of its latest report on the Balkan
country.  “Reduced inflationary pressures may create room for
further policy easing, but the National Bank of Serbia needs to
remain vigilant to achieve its objective of bringing inflation
back into its target band,” the IMF said.  The Washington-based lender’s board of directors confirmed
on Sept. 30 a new 18-month precautionary loan program for
Serbia, worth 1 billion euros ($1.33 billion).  The central bank cut its benchmark two-week repurchase rate
half a point to 11.25 percent on Sept. 8 as inflationary
pressures eased and concern shifted to weakening growth outlook.  The bank targets an inflation rate of 4.5 percent plus or
minus 1.5 percentage points at the end of 2011 and 4 percent
plus or minus 1.5 percentage points at the end of 2012.  This month’s Serbian survey compiled by Bloomberg shows
inflationary expectations have subsided, with analysts seeing
inflation in October next year at 7 percent, a full percentage
point below their forecast for September 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
