Hong Kong ’s housing prices may be in
a bubble, and could repeat the collapse that occurred during the
Asian financial crisis,  Fitch Ratings  said.  Fitch affirmed its ratings on Hong Kong’s debt, citing a
prudent fiscal policy held by the city government and
“resilience” in the economy supported by competitiveness of
the services sector, according to a statement today.  Hong Kong home prices dropped by as much as two-thirds in
1997 during the Asian financial crisis. Prices began to rebound
in 2005 and have nearly doubled since.  To contact the reporter on this story:
