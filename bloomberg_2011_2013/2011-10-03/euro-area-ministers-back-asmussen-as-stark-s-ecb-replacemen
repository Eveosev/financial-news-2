Ministers from the 17 euro-area
nations backed German Deputy Finance Minister  Joerg Asmussen  as
the replacement for Juergen Stark on the European Central Bank’s
Executive Board, said a person familiar with their discussions.  The decision was made at a meeting of the ministers in
Luxembourg today, said the person, who declined to be identified
because the talks are private.  Stark, 63, has been a member of the ECB’s Executive Board
since 2006 and occupied the informal position of chief
economist. As a former vice-president of the Bundesbank, Stark
was an advocate of conservative monetary policy at the
Frankfurt-based European central bank, and was known to have
become increasingly uncomfortable with the ECB’s crisis-fighting
measures including the purchase of sovereign debt. “It’s
generally known that I’m not a glowing advocate of these
purchases,” Stark said in a Bloomberg News interview Aug. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
