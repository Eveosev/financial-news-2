Canadian stocks fell, led by energy
companies and banks, as Europe’s finance leaders prepared to
weigh the risk of a Greek debt default.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) ,  Canada ’s biggest oil and gas producer,
lost 5.5 percent after crude oil fell to the lowest level in
more than a year.  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) , Canada’s biggest base-
metals and coal producer, sank 7.2 percent as copper fell below
$3 per pound to a 14-month low. Canadian National Railway Co.,
the country’s largest railroad, decreased 2.4 percent as
transport companies slipped.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index lost 372 points,
or 3.2 percent, to 11,251.84, the lowest since July 6, 2010, as
all 10 industries in the index fell.  “The macro view is still driving everything right now with
fear of a global slowdown and a debt crisis in  Europe ,”
Jennifer Radman, a  money manager  at Caldwell Investment
Management Ltd. in Toronto, said in a telephone interview. The
firm oversees about C$1 billion ($953 million). “Commodity
prices are a big exposure to a slowdown in global growth.”  The S&P/TSX slid 13 percent in the third quarter, the most
since the last three months of 2008, as commodities had the
steepest quarterly drop since the financial crisis. The S&P GSCI
index of 24 raw materials fell 11 percent last quarter on
concerns that the world will slide into another recession. The
stock benchmark gauge gained 1.4 percent last week in its first
advance in a month.  The Greek government approved 6.6 billion euros ($8.8
billion) of austerity measures yesterday to narrow the 2012
deficit to 6.8 percent of gross domestic product, missing the
6.5 percent goal previously set with the EU,  International
Monetary Fund  and  European Central Bank . European Union Economic
and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  praised the budget
cuts while saying it’s too early to know whether they are
sufficient to secure the next aid tranche for  Greece .  Energy Index  The S&P/TSX Energy Index fell 4.8 percent after falling 19
percent last quarter. Suncor Energy lost 5.5 percent to C$25.28.

energy company by market value, fell 5.6 percent to C$29.05.
 Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE) , the country’s fifth-largest energy company,
decreased 4.2 percent to C$30.93.  The S&P/TSX Financial Index dropped 3 percent as banks and
insurance companies declined. Banks lost after a report
yesterday from Cheryl Pate and Timothy Skiendzielewski at Morgan
Stanley said investment banking profits for Canadian lenders
will fall 46 percent in the fourth quarter from the third as
capital market revenue remains weak into 2012.  Lenders Decline  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , the country’s second-largest lender
by assets, fell 3 percent to C$71.67. Royal Bank of Canada, the
country’s largest lender, lost 2.7 percent to C$46.78.  Bank of
Nova Scotia (BNS) , Canada’s third-biggest lender, slipped 3 percent to
C$51.12.  Insurance companies fell after a report from Andre-Philippe Hardy, an analyst with the  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , said life
insurance companies are likely to record weaker-than-normal
results for the third quarter because “equity markets and
 interest rates  declined sharply.”  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) , North America’s fourth-biggest
insurer, slipped 4.8 percent to C$11.37.  Sun Life Financial
Inc. (SLF) , the country’s third-biggest insurer, lost 4.2 percent to
C$23.97.  Canadian base-metal companies dropped after copper extended
the biggest quarterly retreat since 2008 on concern that slowing
growth will curb demand.  Copper, Zinc Miners  Teck Resources Ltd. slipped 7.2 percent to C$28.69.  Quadra

carload growth is likely slowing.  Canadian National Railway Co. (CNR)  fell 2.4 percent to C$68.38.

railroad, decreased 4 percent to C$48.51.  European Goldfields Ltd. (EGU) , which operates in southern
