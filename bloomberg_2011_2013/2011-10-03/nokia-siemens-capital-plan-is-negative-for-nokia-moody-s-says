A plan to provide 1 billion euros
($1.33 billion) to Nokia Siemens Networks is negative for  Nokia
Oyj (NOK1V) ’s credit rating, Moody’s Investors Service said in a report.  Nokia and  Siemens AG (SIE)  will each provide 500 million euros to
their 50-50 joint venture, the Espoo, Finland-based company said
in a statement Sept. 29.  “The capital injection, which we expected, is credit
negative for Nokia as it reduces cash balances at the parent
level, which are key to its rating,” Moody’s said in its Weekly
Credit Outlook. “The credit implications are much more
pronounced for Nokia, whose liquidity is a key rating factor.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
