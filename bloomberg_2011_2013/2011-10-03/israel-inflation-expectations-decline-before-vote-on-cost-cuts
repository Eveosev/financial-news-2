Israeli inflation expectations
retreated to the lowest level in two weeks as the government
debates recommendations to bring down living costs and after
food manufacturers cut some prices.  The two-year breakeven rate, which reflects market
expectations for inflation over the period, tumbled 14 basis
points, or 0.14 percentage point, to 179 at the 4:30 p.m. close
in Tel Aviv, implying an average annual inflation rate of 1.79
percent. Inflation-linked bonds due June 2013 fell for a second
day, pushing the yield up 10 basis points to 1.16 percent.
Demand for inflation-linked bonds at a  Finance Ministry  debt
auction today declined.  The Cabinet may decide as early as today on recommendations
of a panel appointed by Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  in
response to consumer protests that brought hundreds of thousands
to the streets in the past few months.  Strauss Group Ltd. (STRS) , which
derives about a fifth of its revenue from dairy products, said
yesterday it would lower some of its milk products’ prices 12
percent. Tnuva Food Industries Agricultural Co-Op In Israel Ltd.
yesterday said it would cut the prices it recommends
supermarkets charge for some dairy products.  Slowing Inflation  “Because of the issue of lower prices, mainly of food
prices, the market thinks coming inflation indexes will be
weak,” Assaf Rosenberg, head of fixed-income sales at
Excellence Nessuah Investment House Ltd. in  Ramat Gan , Israel,
said by telephone.  Annual inflation slowed to 3.4 percent in August from a
high this year of 4.3 percent in March. Consumer prices are
expected to rise 2.3 percent in the next 12 months, according to
the average of forecasters surveyed by the Bank of  Israel , the
bank said Sept. 20. Inflation has been above the government’s 1
percent to 3 percent target range since the start of the year.  The Finance Ministry raised 1.4 billion shekels ($373
million) at debt auctions today, including 200 million shekels
of 1.5 percent CPI-linked bonds due in June 2014. The sale of
inflation-linked securities was four times oversubscribed
compared with six times at a sale of the bonds last week. The
auctions also included 250 million shekels of 5.5 percent bonds
due January 2022, which were sold at an average price of 109.67.
That sale was 5.7 times oversubscribed compared with 4.9 times
for last week’s sale, which priced at 108.94.  Better Price  The 5.5 percent Mimshal Shiklit notes increased to 109.98,
pushing the yield down four basis points to 4.6 percent. The
price rose because the “auction price closed at a better than
market price,” Rosenberg said.  Expectations of a global slowdown and a sharp decline in
commodity prices are also lowering inflation expectations, Ori Greenfeld, head of the macro research department at Psagot
Investment House Ltd. in  Tel Aviv  said by telephone.  Fitch Ratings today lowered its 2011 world economic growth
forecast to 2.6 percent from 3.1 percent and its 2012 estimate
to 2.7 percent from 3.4 percent. Israel’s central bank on Sept.
22 reduced its 2012 growth forecast to 3.2 percent from 3.9
percent, citing increased uncertainty about the global economy
and a decline in the rate of growth in world trade.  Commodities fell to a 10-month low on speculation a Greek
default would slow global growth and curb demand for raw
materials. Oil for November delivery declined as much as 3
percent to $76.85 a barrel. Crude lost 17 percent last quarter.  The shekel slipped 0.1 percent to 3.7540 per dollar at 5:25
p.m. in Tel Aviv. Two-year interest-rate swaps, an indicator of
investor expectations for rates over the period, rose one basis
point to 2.76 percent. The Tel Bond 40 index of corporate bonds
dropped 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
