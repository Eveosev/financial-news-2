Diageo Plc (DGE) , the world’s largest
distiller, agreed to buy Ethiopia’s state-owned Meta Abo Brewery
for $225 million after outbidding  SABMiller Plc (SAB)  and  Heineken NV. (HEIA)   Diageo, which makes Guinness stout, will expand Meta Abo
and introduce new products, Wondafrash Assefa, a spokesman for
Ethiopia’s Private and Public Enterprises Supervising Agency,
said today by phone from Addis Ababa. SABMiller, the world’s
second-biggest brewer by volume, bid $190 million for the asset,
and Heineken offered $188 million, he said.  Nigel Fairbrass, a spokesman for SABMiller, confirmed that
the brewer had bid for the asset. A spokesman for Heineken
declined to comment.  Diageo, the London-based maker of spirits including Johnnie
Walker whisky and Smirnoff vodka, is among consumer-goods
companies seeking sales growth in emerging markets to offset
weaker demand in western  Europe  and the U.S. Africa is
attractive as consumers have increasing disposable income, Nick Blazquez, head of Diageo’s Africa unit, said in April.  Meta Abo is the last of Ethiopia’s state-owned brewing
assets to be sold. Heineken, the world’s third-largest brewer,
bought two beermakers in the country for about $160 million in
May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
