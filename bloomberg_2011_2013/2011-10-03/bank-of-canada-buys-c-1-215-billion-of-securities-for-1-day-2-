The  Bank of Canada  bought C$1.215
billion ($1.16 billion) of securities for one day.  The central bank announced the purchase, aimed to keep
overnight lending rates close to its current target of 1
percent, on its website today from Ottawa.  Earlier, the bank said it had bought C$550 million worth of
securities.  The bank also increased the amount of settlement balances
in the Large Value Transfer System to C$705 million from the
regular daily target of C$25 million. The funds are used to help
settle payments between banks and brokers, and a higher amount
can also encourage lower  interest rates  on interbank loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
