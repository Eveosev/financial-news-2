The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Sao Paulo trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 12:28 p.m. New York time.
Preferred shares are usually the most-traded class of stock.  The Bovespa Index fell 1.1 percent to 51,724.14.  B2W Cia. Global do Varejo (BTOW3 BS), a Brazilian online
retailer, declined 5.7 percent to 13.87 reais, its lowest price
since Aug. 26 as companies that depend on domestic demand fell
on concern that  Greece  will default on debt payments, leading to
slower global economic growth.  Hypermarcas SA (HYPE3)  (HYPE3 BS), the Brazilian consumer-products
company that made 12 acquisitions since the start of 2010,
dropped 5 percent to 8.40 reais, as concern about global growth
put downward pressure on companies that rely on domestic
consumption.  OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA (OGXP3 BS), the  oil
company  controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista , retreated 2.8
percent to 11.18 reais, its lowest price in more than two weeks
as Banco Santander SA cut its target price, and crude fell.
Santander, which has a “hold” rating on OGX shares, assigned a
2012 year-end price target of 21 reais, replacing a 2011 year-
end mark of 25 reais.  Qualicorp SA (QUAL3 BS), a Brazilian health-insurance
broker, gained 3.6 percent to 14.50 reais, as the shares were
rated a new “buy” at Banco BTG Pactual by equity analyst Joao Carlos Santos. BTG’s 12-month target price is 19 reais.
