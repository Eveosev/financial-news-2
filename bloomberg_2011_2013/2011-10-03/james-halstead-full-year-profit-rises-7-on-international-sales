James Halstead Plc (JHD) , a U.K. maker of
branded commercial flooring products, said full-year profit rose
7 percent as international sales gained.  Net income rose to 27.5 million pounds ($43 million), or
26.3 pence per share, from 25.7 million pounds, or 24.8 pence
per share, the Radcliffe, England-based company said in a
Regulatory News Service statement today. Revenue increased 15
percent to a record 213.9 million pounds.  International sales, accounting for 66 percent of revenue,
rose 22 percent. U.K. sales grew 2.7 percent. The sales’ margin
fell to 40.2 percent from 42.6 percent on tight pricing on
export projects, higher raw material costs and start-up expenses
at the Riverside plant in Teesside, the company said.  “Notwithstanding these figures, it was a difficult year,”
Geoffrey Halstead, chairman, said in the release. “The U.K.
economy and the construction sector in particular faced an
austere backdrop. Additional challenges were the price, and at
times availability, of basic raw materials.”  He added that the coming year will be “testing” as
competitors look to take market share.  The shares fell 1.7 percent, or 7.38  pence, to 420 pence,
in trading in  London  at 9:02 a.m., giving the company a market
value of 438 million pounds. The company proposed a final
dividend of 9.8 pence per share, up from 9.375 pence a year
earlier.  To contact the reporter for this story:
