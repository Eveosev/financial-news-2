Tanzania ’s benchmark coffee grade
fell 8.4 percent at an auction on Sept. 29, reflecting lower
global prices, the Tanzania Coffee Board said.  The average price for Arabica AA declined to $281.87 per 50
kilograms (110 pounds) from $307.77 a week earlier, the board
said today by e-mail from Moshi in northern Tanzania.  The grade sold for as much as $320 compared with $315.80 at
the previous sale, while supplies were little changed at 2,635
60-kilogram bags from 2,629 bags, it said.  Prices for other grades also declined after supplies of the
beans increased at the auction, the board said.  Average prices for mild arabica coffee were down $21.75 per
50 kilograms and up $2.75 per 50 kilograms for robusta beans,
the board said. Still, the prices were above fair market rates
by $10.80 per 50 kilogram bag for mild arabica and $24.91 for
robusta, the board said.  Total supplies at the fifth auction of the 2011-12 season
climbed 35 percent to 18,201 60-kilogram bags from 13,468 bags
at the previous sale, the board said, without giving reasons.
Sales at the auction climbed 76 percent to 15,348 bags from
8,721 bags as buyers replenished stocks, the board said.  The country’s output in the 12 months through June 2012 may
fall 20 percent to 45,000 metric tons from 56,247 tons last
season after a drought reduced the crop, Adolph Kumburu, the
board’s chief executive officer, said on July 14.  Tanzania reaps its crop from April through August. Arabica
accounts for 75 percent of the country’s output, while robusta
accounts for the rest.  The following are details of Sept. 29 auction in U.S.
