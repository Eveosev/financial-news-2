Asian stocks fell, driving a regional
benchmark gauge toward its lowest close in more than two years,
as disagreement among policy makers over how to resolve Europe’s
debt crisis dimmed the outlook for exporters and banks.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a clothier that counts Europe as its
biggest market, dropped 4.8 percent in Hong Kong. Samsung
Electronics Co., which gets a fifth of its sales in Europe, lost
1.4 percent in Seoul.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) ,
Japan’s No. 1 listed lender by market value, sank 3.8 percent in
 Tokyo . Mitsubishi Corp., Japan’s biggest commodities trader,
slumped 5.7 percent as oil and metal prices tumbled.  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index fell 2.2 percent to 107.7 as of
5:31 p.m. in Mumbai, extending its biggest quarterly decline in
almost three years. The measure closed at the lowest level since
July 2009 as benchmark indexes worldwide have dropped more than
20 percent from their peaks, entering a so-called bear market.
Asian stocks also fell after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its
forecast for earnings expansion in Asia excluding  Japan .  “Fear is still in the driver’s seat,” said  Shane Oliver ,
Sydney-based head of investment strategy at AMP Capital
Investors Ltd., which has almost $100 billion under management.
“With Europe sliding into recession, credit markets continue to
worsen, and that will affect growth in Asia by reducing export
demand. There’s this worry that Europe is going to implode and
drag down the U.S. with it.”  About two stocks fell for each that rose in the MSCI Index
and all 10 industry groups declined, led by energy shares.  Nikkei, Hang Seng  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average fell 1.1 percent. South
Korea’s Kospi Index slumped 3.6 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
dropped 0.6 percent after the Reserve Bank of Australia kept its
benchmark  interest rate  unchanged.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index
fell 3.4 percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 1.3
percent today, having earlier risen as much as 0.7 percent. In
 New York  yesterday, the index fell 2.9 percent as concern over
the Greek debt crisis and a slump in the stock price of Bank of
America Corp. offset a rebound in manufacturing and construction
spending. The measure closed under 1,100 for the first time in
more than a year, putting the gauge within 1 percent of a bear
market.  Bank of America slumped 9.6 percent to below $6 in New York
trading for the first time in 2 1/2 years as concern about
Europe’s debt crisis spurred financial-stock declines on both
sides of the Atlantic. Financial shares are under pressure as
European regulators struggle to quell concern that their lenders
may be hurt by the sovereign-debt crisis.  Exporters, Banks  Asian exporters and banks fell today. Esprit slumped 4.8
percent to HK$9.39 in Hong Kong. Samsung slid 1.4 percent to
828,000 won in Seoul, and Honda Motor Co., a Japanese carmaker
that gets more than 80 percent of its revenue abroad, slid 2.8
percent to 2,202 yen in Tokyo.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group lost 3.8 percent to 331 yen,
leading Asian banks lower. In Sydney,  National Australia Bank
Ltd. (NAB) , the country’s fourth-largest bank by market value, slid
0.8 percent to A$21.46.  German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  opposed moves to
further scale up the European Financial Stability Facility until
the final three countries approve the fund’s latest upgrade.
Slovakia, the Netherlands and Malta have yet to ratify an
earlier decision to expand the fund to 440 billion euros ($581
billion).  Multiple Fronts  Europe’s financial leaders are fighting on multiple fronts,
trying to extinguish the Greek crisis while insulating Italy and
Spain and coming up with a formula for banks that the
 International Monetary Fund  says face as much as 300 billion
euros in credit risk.  “If we don’t get a resolution in  Greece , we may see a
disorderly default,” said Koichi Kurose, chief economist in
Tokyo at Resona Bank Ltd., which oversees the equivalent of $68
billion in assets. “The politicians are all over the place.
Stocks are pricing in a scenario where the financial crisis
spreads in  Europe , the U.S. economy worsens, and it leads to a
deterioration in the global economy.”  Separately, Goldman Sachs cut its forecast for earnings
growth in Asia ex-Japan after lowering its outlook for global
economic expansion. Per-share earnings may grow 10 percent this
year and 7 percent next year, lower than an earlier prediction
of 11 percent growth for both years, analysts led by Timothy Moe
wrote in a report today.  Bear Market  More than $10 trillion was wiped from global equity markets
in the third quarter. Benchmark measures for 36 of 45 nations in
the MSCI All-Country World Index posted declines of 20 percent
or more from their peaks, meeting the common definition of a
bear market, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Besides
the U.S., only two other developed markets -- the U.K. and  New
Zealand  -- haven’t dropped 20 percent or more from their most-
recent highs.  Mitsubishi Corp. slumped 5.7 percent to 1,429 yen in Tokyo
after oil prices slid.  Inpex Corp. (1605) , Japan’s No. 1 energy
explorer, declined 3.6 percent to 455,500 yen.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) ,
 China ’s largest offshore energy explorer, lost 6.8 percent to
HK$11.34 in Hong Kong.  Oil for November delivery tumbled 2 percent to $77.61 a
barrel, the lowest level in more than a year, in New York
yesterday on concern that Greece will default on debt payments,
leading to slower global economic growth and lower fuel
consumption. Copper futures for December delivery fell below $3
a pound to a 14-month low on signs that demand for industrial
metals will wane as economies falter.  New York-traded copper slumped as much as 3.6 percent today
and crude slipped as much as 2.2 percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 20 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 13 percent drop by the S&P
500 and a 19 percent loss by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks
in the Asian benchmark are valued at 11.2 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 11.1 times for the S&P 500
and 9.3 times for the Stoxx 600.  The Asia-Pacific index tumbled 16 percent in the third
quarter, the biggest drop since 2008. The measure is down about
23 percent from this year’s high on May 2.  To contact the reporters on this story:
