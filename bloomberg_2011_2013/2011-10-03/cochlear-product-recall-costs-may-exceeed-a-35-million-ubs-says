Cochlear Ltd. (COH) ’s cost of voluntarily
recalling its Nucleus 5 range of hearing devices because of a
manufacturing glitch may exceed A$35 million, UBS said.  It’s too early to predict the product’s return to market
and six months remains the “minimum estimate,” UBS Sydney-
based health-care analysts  Andrew Goodsall  and Dan Hurren said
in a report today in which they reiterated a “sell” rating on
the shares.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
