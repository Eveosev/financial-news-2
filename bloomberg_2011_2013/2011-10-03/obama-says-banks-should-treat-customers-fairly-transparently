President  Barack Obama  said U.S.
banks should treat customers “fairly” and seek to profit “the
old-fashioned way” through loans to businesses.  Asked about  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ’s plan to charge a $5
monthly charge for some debit-card users, Obama said: “My hope
is that you’re going to see a bunch of the banks say this is not
good business practice.”  Obama spoke during an interview on the websites of ABC News
and Yahoo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
