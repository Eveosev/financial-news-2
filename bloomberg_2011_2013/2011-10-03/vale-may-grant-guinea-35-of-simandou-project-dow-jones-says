Vale SA (VALE5)  may concede 35 percent of its
Simandou iron-ore project in Guinea to the government after the
African country passed new mining rules, Dow Jones Newswires
 reported , citing a Vale manager that it didn’t identify.  The deal may be similar to the agreement reached in April
between the Guinean government and rival miner Rio Tinto Group,
which is also developing another part of Simandou, Dow Jones
said.  A Vale official in  Rio de Janeiro , who declined to be named
citing corporate policy, said the company won’t comment on
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
