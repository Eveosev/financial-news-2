The U.S. Supreme Court turned away a
bid by  AT&T Inc. (T)  for a $500 million tax refund in a fight
stemming from government subsidies to the company for serving
remote areas.  The justices today left intact a federal appeals court
ruling that rejected the Dallas-based company’s bid for a refund
on its 1998 and 1999 federal taxes.  AT&T received $1.5 billion during those years under the
state and federal “universal service” programs. The company
sought to treat the money as “contributions to capital,” a
classification that would have spread the tax burden over
several years.  The  Internal Revenue Service  disagreed, saying the company
had to treat the funds as income for the 1998 and 1999 tax
years.  “We are disappointed with the  Supreme Court ’s decision,”
the company said in a statement. “However, AT&T does not expect
any impact to our financial statements.”  The company fell 36 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $28.16 today
in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  The case is AT&T v. United States, 10-1204.  To contact the reporter on this story:
