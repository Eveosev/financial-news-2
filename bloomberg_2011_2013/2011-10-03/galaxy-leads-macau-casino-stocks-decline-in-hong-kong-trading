SJM Holdings Ltd. (880)  plunged by a record
in Hong Kong trading as Macau casino operators lost a combined
$9 billion in market value amid concern slowing China growth and
slumping stock markets may damp demand for gambling.  Macau magnate  Stanley Ho ’s SJM,  Asia ’s biggest casino
company by sales, declined 26 percent, the most since its
listing in July 2008, to HK$10.50 at the 4 p.m. close of
trading.  Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27) , founded by billionaire
Lui Che-Woo, fell 19 percent, the most since January 2009, to
HK$9.42.  A 21 percent slump in Chinese stocks in the last six months
has reduced the fortunes of many of the nation’s investors, who
have helped casino gambling  revenue  in the former Portuguese
colony surge to four times that of the  Las Vegas Strip . The
European debt crisis and faltering U.S. growth may hurt many
companies in  China , where policy makers have also curbed access
to credit.  “If the credit situation really goes worse, we’d see the
people who normally finance the junkets cut their funding,”
said Gabriel Chan, a Hong Kong-based equity analyst at Credit
Suisse Group AG. “People are just pricing in the what-if.”  The People’s Bank of China has raised  interest rates  five
times in the past 12 months to defuse the fastest gains in
consumer prices since 2008, steps that have raised concern the
pace of economic expansion will slow.  Slowing Growth  Economic growth in China may decline to less than 5 percent
annually by 2016, according to 59 percent of respondents in the
quarterly Bloomberg Global Poll of investors, analysts and
traders who are Bloomberg subscribers. Growth was 9.5 percent in
the second quarter.  Casino gambling revenue  in Macau jumped 58 percent to 188
billion patacas ($23.5 billion) last year, driven by demand from
high-stakes gamblers on junkets from mainland China. The only
place in China where casinos are legal saw its gambling venues’
sales grow 47 percent to 173 billion patacas in the eight months
through August.  While junket operators are “a bit more conservative”
about extending credit, they haven’t had any liquidity problems,
Credit Suisse’s Chan said in a Sept. 27 note to clients. Casino
operators are still seeing “robust advanced hotel booking” for
Golden Week holiday this week, he said.  Macau may release September casino gambling revenue this
week.  SJM gained 67 percent from the start of the year to a
record HK$20.65 on Aug. 1 in  Hong Kong  trading. Galaxy climbed
148 percent in the period to a record HK$21.85 on the same day.  ‘Selling Winners’  “People are afraid and selling their winners,” Philip Tulk, head of Asian conglomerates and gaming research at Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc., said in an interview in Hong Kong.
“In this kind of market, anything that’s up gets sold.”  Tulk lowered his target prices on Sept. 30 for all the
casino operators except for  Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (MPEL) , and
downgraded SJM and Wynn Macau Ltd.’s stock from “buy” to
“hold.” He raised Galaxy’s stock from “hold” to “buy” and
remains “overweight” on the whole sector.  Sands China Ltd. (1928)  slumped 14 percent, the steepest drop
since it listed in November 2009, to HK$15.98.  Wynn Macau Ltd. (1128) 
retreated 11 percent to HK$16.74 and  Melco International
Development Ltd. (200) , one of the partners behind Melco Crown, fell
16 percent to HK$4.39.  MGM China Holdings Ltd. plummeted 20 percent to HK$8.21,
the lowest price since June 3, when it listed on the city’s
exchange. The benchmark index slid 4.4 percent.  Crown Ltd., controlled by billionaire  James Packer  and the
other partner behind Melco Crown, fell 3.3 percent to A$7.71,
the lowest since July last year, in Sydney trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
