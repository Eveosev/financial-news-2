Rhapsody International Inc., the
Internet music service, said it will acquire the subscribers and
other assets of rival Napster, a unit of Best Buy Co.  Best Buy, the world’s biggest consumer electronics
retailer, will get a minority stake in Rhapsody in the deal,
which is expected to close around Nov. 30, the companies said
today in a statement. Rhapsody, a joint venture of  RealNetworks
Inc. (RNWK)  and Viacom Inc.’s MTV Networks, was spun off as an
independent company last year.  Rhapsody, based in Seattle, charges subscribers a fee to
listen to more than 13 million songs. Napster, which started in
1999 as a free music-swapping website, offers a paid music
service and was acquired by Best Buy in 2008. With the U.S.
debut of popular European music service Spotify Ltd., Rhapsody
may be looking to add subscribers, said  Mark Mulligan , an
industry analyst at Forrester Research Inc. in  London .  “It’s a great way to suddenly make Rhapsody the No. 1
music subscription service in the U.S. in the face of Spotify
getting close,” he said. “My hope for Rhapsody would be that
they use this as a platform for reinventing themselves rather
than simply just trying to carry on with the same old product
strategies.”  Mulligan estimates Napster has around 400,000 to 500,000
subscribers. Rhapsody reported more than 800,000 subscribers in
July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
