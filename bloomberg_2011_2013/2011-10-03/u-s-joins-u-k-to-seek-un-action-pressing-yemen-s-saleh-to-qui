The U.S., U.K. and  France  are
discussing a possible draft resolution in the  United Nations 
Security Council to increase pressure on President Ali Abdullah Saleh of  Yemen  to step down.  The text, being prepared by the three permanent members of
the 15-member Security Council, would urge Saleh to follow
through with a transition process outlined by the Gulf
Cooperation Council nations, according to two Western diplomats
who weren’t authorized to publicly discuss the talks.  Action by the UN on Yemen would wait until a resolution
passes seeking to halt the Syrian government’s crackdown on
protests, the diplomats said.  The Gulf Arab nations put forward in April a proposal for
Saleh to hand over power. He has been on the brink of signing
the accord three times.  Saleh returned to the country on Sept. 24 following more
than three months of recuperation in  Saudi Arabia  after he was
injured in an attack on his compound. Violence in Yemen has
escalated in the past two weeks with daily protests in the
capital and other cities demanding Saleh’s immediate ouster.  -- Editors: Terry Atlas, Steven Komarow  To contact the reporters on this story:
