Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s BMW
brand last month increased its lead in the U.S. luxury
automotive sales race with deliveries rising 19 percent on
continued high demand for the X3 sport-utility vehicle.  Sales of the redesigned X3, which hit U.S. showrooms in
January, rose to 1,853 in September from 146 a year ago,
contributing to the SUV’s almost four-fold increase to 19,167 so
far this year, the Munich-based automaker said yesterday.  “It’s very well received,” said  Jesse Toprak , an industry
analyst with TrueCar.com, a website that tracks auto sales. “It
was one of the better executed redesigns we’ve seen in the
luxury segment in a long while.”  BMW brand deliveries rose to 21,750 in September while U.S.
sales of  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz gained 9 percent to 21,649,
the Stuttgart, Germany-based automaker said.  Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203) ’s Lexus, which has been the annual U.S. luxury sales
leader for the past 11 years, saw September sales fall 12
percent to 14,995.  With September’s results, BMW expanded its lead for the
year. Sales have risen 13 percent to 177,679. Deliveries of
Mercedes vehicles through September rose 6.5 percent to 170,058
in the U.S., the company said in an e-mail, while Lexus’s year-
to-date totals fell 16 percent to 135,647. Toyota is based in
Toyota City,  Japan .  BMW improved the interior and handling of the X3 and has
done well by offering monthly lease deals as low as $459 last
month, Toprak said.  The results exclude Daimler’s Sprinter vans and Smart cars
and BMW’s Mini brand, which aren’t  luxury vehicles .  Sixth Month  BMW has been the monthly luxury sales leader for six
straight months. In the fourth quarter,  Lexus  supply returns to
normal and Mercedes will be at full production of its redesigned
compact C-Class models.  Mercedes last month began offering a two-door version of
its C-Class in the U.S., which Ernst Lieb, head of U.S.
operations, has said may increase the model’s sales by 20
percent. C-Class sales rose 32 percent last month to 6,865
contributing to Mercedes best September on record, the company
said.  Mercedes hasn’t had a two-door version to compete against
BMW’s 3-Series coupe. Mercedes is also out with a redesigned M-
Class SUV.  “There is a lot of new product that’s coming into the
market that’s probably going to create some natural momentum
beyond what we typically see,” Toprak said. “Luxury sales will
be outperforming the market at large in the fourth quarter.”  Cadillac, Audi  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Cadillac luxury brand sales rose 1
percent last month to 12,741, according to the Detroit-based
automaker.  U.S. deliveries of  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi brand rose 19
percent to 9,725 vehicles last month, the Wolfsburg, Germany-
based company said in a statement.  Porsche AG, the Stuttgart-based automaker, sold 2,170
vehicles in the U.S., a 10 percent increase, the company said in
an e-mailed statement.  Nissan Motor Co.’s Infiniti sold 8,479 vehicles, a 2.1
percent increase from a year earlier, the Yokohama, Japan-based
company, said in a statement.  Honda Motor Co., based in  Tokyo , said in a statement that
sales for its Acura brand fell 6.6 percent to 10,010 last month.  Ford Motor Co. (F)  sold 7,018 Lincolns in September, a 6.6
percent decrease from a year earlier, according to a statement
from the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker.  Land Rover deliveries rose 10 percent to 2,740, while
Jaguar sales increased 15 percent to 1,111, Mumbai-based  Tata
Motors Ltd. (TTMT)  said yesterday in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
