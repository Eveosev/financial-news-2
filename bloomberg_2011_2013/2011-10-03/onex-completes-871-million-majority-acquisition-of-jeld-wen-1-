Onex Corp. (OCX) ,  Canada ’s largest private-
equity firm, completed an $871 million acquisition of a majority
stake in Jeld-Wen Holding Inc., a maker of residential doors and
windows.  Onex paid $700 million for 58 percent of Klamath Falls,
Oregon-based Jeld-Wen’s preferred stock and a $171 million
convertible note that can be redeemed within 18 months with
proceeds from asset sales, the Toronto-based firm said today in
a statement.  Onex, which manages about $14 billion and focuses on North
American buyouts, is betting on an “eventual recovery in global
housing markets,” Anthony Munk, an Onex managing director, said
in today’s statement. The firm has partnered with Philip Orsino,
former chief executive officer of Masonite International Corp.,
to expand in building products. Orsino was named president and a
director of Jeld-Wen in August.  Onex said in August it would pay $675 million for the
equity stake, plus a $189 million convertible note. That deal
was increased from a May agreement, when the private-equity firm
said it would pay $475 million for 39 percent of the door
manufacturer. The stake is part of Onex Partners III fund, which
is now 40 percent invested, the company said today.  Jeld-Wen last week completed a $460 million bond offering
to refinance debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
