The U.S.  Supreme Court  refused to
revive two price-fixing lawsuits pressed by gasoline retailers
against OPEC-affiliated companies including Venezuela’s state-
owned Citgo Petroleum Corp.  The justices today left intact a federal appeals court
ruling that said the antitrust lawsuits couldn’t go forward
because they would improperly embroil the judiciary in questions
of defense and foreign policy.  Most of the defendants were at least partly owned by a
foreign government that belongs to the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries. The suits also named the Saudi-owned Saudi
Arabian Oil Co., known as Saudi Aramco; Motiva Enterprises LLC,
a refining company owned jointly by  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and
Saudi Aramco; and units of OAO Lukoil, Russia’s second-largest
oil producer.  The cases are Spectrum Stores v. Citgo, 10-1371, and Fast
Break Foods v. Saudi Arabian Oil, 10-1393.  To contact the reporter on this story:
