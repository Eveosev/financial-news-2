Oil fell in  New York , after closing
last week at a one-year low, on concern that  Greece  will default
on debt payments, leading to slower economic growth and fuel
consumption.  Futures slipped as much as 2.3 percent after dropping 17
percent since the end of June in the worst quarter since 2008.
Reports this week may show manufacturing in the U.S., the
world’s biggest oil consumer, barely grew last month, while job
growth failed to cut unemployment. European finance ministers
meet today in Luxembourg to weigh the threat of a Greek default.
Saudi Arabian Oil Co. canceled a crude shipment to Royal Dutch
Shell Plc after a fire at Shell’s largest oil refinery.  “A Greek default is becoming more and more likely amid
reports the country will miss debt-reduction targets,” said
James Zhang, a strategist at Standard Bank Plc in London, who
forecasts Brent will average $98 a barrel in the fourth quarter.
“The weaker euro and falling equity market are pulling  oil
prices  lower.”  Crude for November delivery fell as much as $1.84 to $77.36
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $77.90 at 1:45 p.m. London time. The
contract fell 3.6 percent to $79.20 on Sept. 30, the lowest
close since Sept. 29, 2010. Last quarter’s decline was the
biggest since the three months ended Dec. 31, 2008.  Bear Market  Brent oil for November settlement slid $1.22, or 1.2
percent, to $101.54 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
 Europe  exchange after falling as low as $101.12. A close below
$101.32 would represent a decline of more than 20 percent from
the April 8 settlement price of $126.65 a barrel, meeting the
common definition of a  bear market . The European benchmark
contract was at a premium of $23.64 to New York crude, compared
with a record of $26.87 on Sept. 6.  “It’s a confidence issue,”  Jonathan Barratt , a managing
director of Commodity Broking Services Pty in Sydney, said by
telephone today. “Economic data in the U.S. hasn’t been all
that terrible, but we will focus on the employment figures at
the end of the week to see whether they are improving.”  The U.S. Institute for Supply Management’s factory index
fell to 50.3 in August, according to a Bloomberg survey of
economists before a report today. A reading of 50 is the
dividing line between contraction and expansion. The jobless
rate held at 9.1 percent for a third month, according to a
separate Bloomberg survey before Labor Department data Oct. 7.  Force Majeure  Saudi Arabian Oil canceled one cargo of 2 million barrels
of crude to Shell and is discussing canceling a second,
according to people with knowledge of the matter. Shell declared
force majeure, exempting it from fulfilling contracts, as it
halted units after the worst fire in 23 years at its 500,000-
barrel-day Pulau Bukom refinery in  Singapore . The company
declined to specify how many customers are affected or how long
the measure will be in place.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ oil
output in September rose to the highest level since November
2008, with a Saudi cut offset by Iraqi and Libyan gains, a
Bloomberg News survey showed. Production increased 75,000
barrels to average 30.055 million barrels a day, according to
the survey of  oil companies , producers and analysts.  Fighting in  Libya  reduced the availability of light, sweet
crude, or oil with low density and sulfur content. The country’s
output fell to 45,000 barrels a day in August, according to
Bloomberg estimates, compared with the 1.6 million barrels a day
in January. The nation pumped 100,000 barrels a day last month.  Hedge funds  cut bullish bets on oil by the most in seven
weeks on concern that economic growth will falter. The funds and
other large speculators reduced wagers on rising prices by 7.4
percent in the week ended Sept. 27, according to the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission’s Commitments of Traders report
released Sept. 30. It was the largest decline since Aug. 9.  In  London , money managers cut bullish bets on  Brent crude 
by 36 percent in the week ended Sept. 27, according to  data
today from ICE Futures Europe.   Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 47,027
contracts, the London-based exchange said today in its weekly
Commitment of Traders report. Net-long positions fell by 26,243
contracts, from 73,270 a week earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
