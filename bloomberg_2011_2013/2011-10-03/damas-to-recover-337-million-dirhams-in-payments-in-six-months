Damas International Ltd. (DAMAS) , a Dubai-
based jewelry maker and retailer, plans to recover more than 337
million dirhams in outstanding payments within six months, its
chief executive said today.  “We have already signed several agreements and started to
recover some funds owed to us,” Anan Fakhreddin said in an
interview in Dubai. “Within six months we expect to get all the
funds back and for this process to be completed.”  The company said Sept. 28 it formed a  task force  to focus
financial recoveries. The company posted a full-year profit of
53.3 million dirhams in the company’s financial year ended March
31 after a loss of 2 billion dirhams a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
