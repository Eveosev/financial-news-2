SolarReserve LLC, which received a
$737 million U.S. Energy Department loan guarantee for a solar-
thermal project in central Nevada, will use hardware from  United
Technologies  Corp.  The 110-megawatt Crescent Dunes plant near Tonopah will
generate enough electricity to power about 75,000 homes, United
Technologiesâ€™ Canoga Park, California-based Pratt & Whitney
Rocketdyne unit said today in a statement. The system uses
mirrors to focus sunlight and heat molten salt, which generates
steam to drive a turbine. SolarReserve has an exclusive license
for the United Technologies solar-thermal system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
