Pakistan ’s inflation slowed for a
second straight month in September, giving policy makers more
scope to cut  interest rates  to bolster economic growth.  Consumer prices rose 10.46 percent from a year earlier,
after climbing 11.56 percent in August, the  Federal Bureau of
Statistics  said in Islamabad today. The median of six estimates
in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 10.65 percent gain. The
bureau in August changed the base year for inflation to 2008
from 2001.  Pakistan’s central bank unexpectedly cut rates in its most
recent policy decision on July 30, breaking away from Asian
neighbors such as India and  Malaysia  that have increased
borrowing costs or kept them steady in recent months to tame
inflation. Growing public debt and living costs have fanned
Pakistan’s 10-year government bond yields to the highest level
after Greece and  Venezuela , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “The biggest contributor to the slowing inflation rate is
the relative stability in food prices,” Khalid Iqbal Siddiqui,
head of research at Invest & Finance Securities Ltd. in Karachi,
said before the report. “I am expecting a 100 basis-point cut
in rates in the next meeting.”  The  State Bank of Pakistan  reduced the discount rate in
July to 13.5 percent from 14 percent. The central bank’s next
monetary policy announcement is scheduled for Oct. 8, and three
of five economists surveyed by Bloomberg News predict the rate
will be lowered to 12.5 percent. The other two expect a 50
basis-point cut to 13 percent.  Government  borrowing  for budgetary support rose 23 percent
to 224 billion rupees ($2.56 billion) in the fiscal year
starting July 1 from a year earlier, according to data on the
 State Bank  of Pakistan’s website. The government announced this
year that it plans to maintain zero net borrowing from the
central bank to contain inflation, one of the highest in  Asia .  The  International Monetary Fund  forecasts Pakistan’s
economy will expand 2.56 percent in 2011, the slowest pace since
the 1.72 percent growth in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
