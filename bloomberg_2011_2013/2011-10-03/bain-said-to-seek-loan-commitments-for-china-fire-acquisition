Bain Capital LLC will seek
commitments of $10 million to $20 million from banks as the $80
million loan backing its acquisition of China Fire & Security
Group Inc. is marketed to other lenders, said a person familiar
with the matter.  Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Holdings Plc
are arranging and underwriting the facility, which pays an all-
in fee of about 555 basis points more than the London interbank
offered rate, said the person.  Those banks may syndicate the loan to around six other
lenders with Taiwanese banks a target, the person said. The
financing is expected to be completed by the end of the year,
the person said.  Amber Parent Ltd., an affiliate of funds managed by Bain,
and Amber Mergerco Inc. is buying Nasdaq-listed China Fire &
Security for $9 a share. The companyâ€™s shareholders voted on
Sept. 23 to approve the merger.  To contact the reporter on this story:
