MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. (WFR) 
withdrew its application for a U.S. Energy Department loan
guarantee to build a 20-megawatt solar photovoltaic power plant
in Nevada.  The company’s SunEdison project development unit decided to
drop out of the guarantee process because it wasn’t able to
complete the paperwork ahead of the program’s Sept. 30 deadline,
Mark Mendenhall, SunEdison’s president for  North America , said
today in an interview.  MEMC, based in St. Peters, Missouri, acquired the solar
project in its August purchase of Fotowatio Renewable Ventures
Inc., the U.S. development unit of Madrid-based Fotowatio
Renewable Ventures.  SunEdison plans to complete the project by the end of next
year using funds from private investors and some investors have
already expressed interest in the project, Mendenhall said.  The Fotowatio project received a conditional commitment for
a $45.6 million guarantee in June. Electricity from the plant
will be sold to  Nevada  Power Company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
