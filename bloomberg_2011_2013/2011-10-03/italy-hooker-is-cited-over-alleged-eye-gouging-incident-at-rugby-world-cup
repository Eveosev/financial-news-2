Italy hooker Leonardo Ghiraldini will
face a  Rugby World Cup  disciplinary hearing today over an
alleged eye-gouging incident in his team’s defeat to Ireland two
days ago.  Ghiraldini was cited by citing commissioner Peter Larter
for “making contact with the eyes or the eye area and acts
contrary to good sportsmanship,” tournament organizers said in
a statement.  Television replays appeared to show Ghiraldini attempting
to push his fingers into the eyes of Ireland prop Cian Healy at
a maul during the Pool C decider in Dunedin,  New Zealand .  Healy and Ireland team management were asked for a brief
statement on the incident after the match, Ireland team manager
Paul McNaughton said at a news conference yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
