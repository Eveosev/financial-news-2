Colombia ’s peso bonds fell, sending
yields to a 10-week high, as concern Greece will default and
deepen  Europe ’s debt crisis reduced demand for higher yielding-
emerging market assets.  The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 10 percent bonds due in
July 2024 rose 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, to
7.74 percent at 11 a.m. New York time. The yield is the highest
since July 25. The bond’s price fell 1.317 centavo to 117.944
centavos per peso.  Greece said it passed a budget backed by its international
creditors, including larger deficits than previously forecast,
as the country moves closer to securing an 8 billion-euro ($10.6
billion) aid payout needed to avoid default. European finance
ministers gathered today to consider enhancements to the
region’s rescue fund and plan to meet again on Oct. 13 to decide
whether  Greece ’s austerity push is enough to win the sixth
bailout payment.  “In the last few weeks, we’ve seen aggressive profit-
taking in emerging markets as investors acknowledge these
countries will see their economies hurt by the international
environment,” said Felipe Campos, head analyst at Alianza
Valores SA brokerage in Bogota. “This view will probably
continue to lead to declines in emerging markets.”  The peso fell 0.7 percent to 1,946.20 per  U.S. dollar , the
lowest since Dec. 29, from 1,931.98 on Sept. 30.  Dollar Auctions  In a bid to ease the peso’s “extreme volatility,”
Colombia’s central bank said Sept. 30 that it will  auction  $200
million in the when the  exchange rate  moves more than 2 percent
above or below its 10-day moving average. The 10-day moving
average will begin to apply Oct. 14, the bank said in a
statement today.  Banco de la Republica also said Sept. 30 it ended a program
of purchasing a minimum of $20 million daily in the  currency
market  after a rout in global markets wiped out the peso’s gains
this year. The currency has dropped 2 percent in 2011.  The central bank’s announcement is helping ease the peso’s
slide today, according to Campos.  “As the auctions help ease volatility, investors bet the
peso won’t fall as much,” Campos said. “Its more psychological
than anything else. What we saw in 2008 is that when the market
enters panic mode, we’ll still see episodes of a lot of
volatility.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
