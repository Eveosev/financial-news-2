U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  said British bank practices before 2008 resembled
“Ponzi schemes,” contributing to the market crash.  The crisis was caused “by the mistakes of human beings,”
Osborne told delegates at the  Conservative Party’s annual
conference  today in Manchester, northwest  England . He blamed
excessive borrowing by the previous Labour government, the
creation of the euro and bankers’ risk-taking for the economic
problems the U.K. faces.  “The banks and those regulating them believed that the
bubble would never stop growing, that markets were always self-
correcting, that greed was always good, that their Ponzi schemes
would never collapse, and that none of the debts would ever turn
bad,” Osborne said. “They let down their customers, they let
down their shareholders, and they let down their country.”  A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent financial arrangement under
which investors are paid high returns from the deposits of
subsequent investors.  Bernard Madoff  was jailed for 150 years in
June 2009 for masterminding the largest ever U.S. Ponzi scheme.  No U.K. banks have been prosecuted for running a similar
operation.  Brian Mairs , a spokesman for the  British Bankers
Association , a London-based industry lobby group representing
200 banks, said the organization does not comment on political
speeches made at party conferences. The body may take up the
allegation with the chancellor in private, he said in a
telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
