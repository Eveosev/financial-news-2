Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  said
he’s focused on protecting Italy from the fallout of the
region’s debt crisis and he’s not interested in a debate on
overhauling the country’s election law.  “What’s in my heart at this moment is to continue to work
to protect Italy from the attacks on our public debt and from
the global financial crisis,” he said in an e-mailed statement.  His government plans to present by the middle of this month
a new decree law to “boost the confidence of families and
Italian companies,” he said.  Opponents of Berlusconi have managed to secure enough
signatures to hold a referendum aimed at repealing the country’s
current election law, a move that could prompt early elections.  He said the news media every day “produce only confusion
and are demoralizing Italians.”  “I’m not working on any reform of the electoral system,”
he said. “The reforms that interest me right now are those of
the tax system, the institutional structure of the country and
the justice system.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
