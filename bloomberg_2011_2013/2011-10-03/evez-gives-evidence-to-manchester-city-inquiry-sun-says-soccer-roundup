The following is a roundup of soccer
stories from U.K. newspapers, with clickable links to the Web.  Tevez Inquiry  Carlos Tevez  will give evidence today as part of Manchester
City’s internal investigation into why he didn’t come on as a
substitute at  Bayern Munich  last week,  the Sun  reported.  While Tevez will claim it was a misunderstanding, former
City chairman Francis Lee said the striker should be fired for
his “unforgivable” behavior, according to the Sun.  Ferdinand Out  Rio Ferdinand  was left out of England’s Euro 2012 qualifier
against Montenegro, with  Phil Jagielka  picked as the fourth
center-back,  the Independent  reported.  Ferdinand, the former national-team captain, is short on
form and fitness, according to the Independent.  Sagna Sidelined  Arsenal’s Bacary Sagna will be out of action for three
months after breaking his leg in a 2-1 loss against Tottenham
yesterday, the  Daily Mail  reported.  Carl Jenkinson, an offseason signing from Charlton who came
on as a substitute against Spurs, could get an extended run in
the first team in Sagna’s absence, according to the Mail.  Taarabt Leaves  Queens Park Rangers midfielder Adel Taarabt faces a “heavy
fine” after walking out during a 6-0 loss at Fulham at the
weekend, the  Daily Mail  reported.  The Moroccan was substituted at half-time and seen by QPR
fans outside before the game ended, the Mail said, adding he
sprinted off when the atmosphere became hostile.  To contact the reporters on this story:
