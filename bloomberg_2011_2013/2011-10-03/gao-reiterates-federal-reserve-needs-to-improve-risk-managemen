The  Federal Reserve  needs to improve
its risk management practices for lending during financial
crises, an official from the U.S. Government Accountability
Office said in prepared testimony.  “Existing policies and procedures for managing employee
conflicts may not be sufficient to avoid the appearance of a
conflict in all situations,” Orice Williams Brown, managing
director of financial markets and community investment for the
GAO, said in a copy of testimony obtained by Bloomberg News.  Brown is scheduled to speak tomorrow before a U.S. House
subcommittee during a hearing focused on auditing the Fed.
Brown’s testimony is based on a GAO study released in July on
the central bank board’s emergency actions from December 2007 to
July 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
