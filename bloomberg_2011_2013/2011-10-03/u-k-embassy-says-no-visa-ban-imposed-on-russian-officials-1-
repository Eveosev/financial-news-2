The British embassy in Moscow denied
that the U.K. imposed a ban on Russian officials over the death
of anti-corruption lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky.  The U.K. has made no changes in its government policies and
didn’t bar 60 officials linked to Magnitsky’s death in a Moscow
prison in 2009, an embassy spokesman said by phone from Moscow
today, declining to be identified in line with Foreign Office
rules.  The British weekly, The Observer, reported yesterday that
the U.K. had secretly imposed the visa ban, citing former Europe
Minister, Christopher Bryant, as saying he was informed of the
measure by Immigration Minister Damian Green.  The  Home Office  declined to comment on individual cases,
adding in an e-mailed statement: “We can refuse a visa when the
individual’s character, conduct or associations makes entry to
the U.K. undesirable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
