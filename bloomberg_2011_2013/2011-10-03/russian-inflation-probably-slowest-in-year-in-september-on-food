Russian inflation was probably the
slowest in a year in September as food-price growth weakened and
higher borrowing costs took hold.  Consumer prices rose 7.2 percent from a year earlier
following an 8.2 percent increase the previous month, according
to the median estimate of 14 economists in a Bloomberg survey.
Prices declined 0.1 percent from August, the survey showed. The
Federal Statistics Service in Moscow may publish the data today.  Russia’s inflation rate has dropped from 9.6 percent in
May, equaling its highest in 18 months. A further easing in
prices would help policy makers meet this year’s 7 percent
inflation target, the slowest since the collapse of the  Soviet
Union  in 1991. Bank Rossii said yesterday it aims to slow price
gains to 4 percent to 5 percent in 2014.  “We expect inflation to be contained to 6.7 percent this
year thanks to the good harvest and deflationary effects seen
this summer,” Maria Pomelnikova, an analyst at Raiffeisenbank
in Moscow, said yesterday by phone. “The slowdown in inflation
was helped by tighter monetary policy, including a tightening of
the interest-rate corridor.”  ‘Liquidity Shortfalls’  The central bank last month raised the deposit rate, which
it uses to absorb rubles from the banking system, while lowering
the repurchase rate that lenders use to borrow extra cash. The
move “helps limit volatility of money market interest rates as
risks arise of ruble-liquidity shortfalls in the banking
system,” the regulator said Sept. 14.  Policy makers raised the overnight auction-based deposit
rate five times since December to 3.75 percent from 2.5 percent.
The repurchase rate was raised twice, from 5 percent to 5.5
percent, before being reduced by a quarter-point last month.
That narrowed the so-called interest-rate corridor in which
market rates tend to fluctuate to 1.5 percentage points from 2.5
percentage points. The benchmark refinancing rate remained at
8.25 percent.  Slower inflation has boosted  consumer spending  this year as
real wages rise. Food retailers such as X5 Retail Group and OAO
Magnit and manufacturers including OAO AvtoVAZ, the country’s
largest car maker, have benefited from a surge in domestic
demand.  This year’s grain harvest may reach 93 million metric tons,
53 percent more than a year ago, when drought cut the crop to
60.9 million tons, Arkady Zlochevsky, president of the Russian
Grain Union, told reporters yesterday in Moscow. About 25
million tons of grain may be exported, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
