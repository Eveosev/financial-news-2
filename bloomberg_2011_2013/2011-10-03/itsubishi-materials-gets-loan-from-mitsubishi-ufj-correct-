Mitsubishi Materials Corp. (5711)  completed
a 20 billion yen ($260 million) syndicated loan with a group of
banks led by Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., according to a
person with direct knowledge of the matter.  The five-year loan was priced at 17.5 basis points more
than the six-month London interbank offered rate for yen,
according to the person, who declined to be identified because
the information is private.  The company refinanced its syndicated loan to reduce
interest costs, Hideyasu Itagaki, Mitsubishi Materialsâ€™ head of
accounting, said in a phone interview from Tokyo, declining to
elaborate.  Mitsubishi Materials is rated BBB+ by Rating and Investment
Information Inc. and Japan Credit Rating Agency Ltd., according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
