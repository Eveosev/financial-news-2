Sheikh Ahmed  bin Saeed  Al Maktoum ,
the head of the Dubai Supreme Fiscal Committee, said the
government is satisfied with the composition of the emirate’s
economy and urged companies to press ahead with restructuring
plans.  “I am very happy with the core business of Dubai,” which
includes trade and tourism, said Sheikh Ahmed, who is also
chairman of  Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES)  and the uncle of Dubai’s ruler.  “There are some companies that must continue to work on
their restructuring,” Sheikh Ahmed said.  Dubai, the second-biggest of the seven sheikhdoms that make
up the U.A.E., had to seek help from neighboring Abu Dhabi after
the global credit crisis pushed property prices down by more
than half from their peak in 2008, and frozen credit markets
forced some state-owned companies to delay loan payments. Dubai
World signed a final agreement with its bank creditors in March
to restructure $25 billion of debt.  “Sometimes we are not very much directly affected by
what’s happening in the U.S. and  Europe , but I’m sure that some
of the banks that are here might have certain issues,” he said.
He didn’t specify which lenders he was referring to.  He said that Dubai’s new oil field, named Al Jalila, will
begin production this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
