Sotheby’s (BID)  failed to sell all of the
wine in a Hong Kong auction for the first time in 17 sales as
 China ’s wealthy collectors passed on oversized bottles of
Chateau  Lafite  Rothschild yesterday in Hong Kong.  The weekend sales came after the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index had its worst quarter since the end of 2008. Top lot in
the two days of wine purchases, worth a total of HK$99.1 million
($12.7 million), was the sale of a 12-bottle case of 1988
Domaine de la Romanee-Conti Burgundy for HK$907,500.  “There weren’t so many buyers,” said Liu Dan, a Beijing-
based collector who picked up six cases of Chateau Mouton
Rothschild 1996 vintage for $HK48,400 each. “Prices were
cheap.”  Sotheby’s raised HK$231.5 million during the first two days
of its  Hong Kong  Autumn sales that included the wine and an
evening offering of contemporary Chinese art. The auctions were
part of six days of sales including 3,400 lots of porcelain, art
and jewels that New York-based Sotheby’s forecasts will raise
more than HK$2.7 billion.  Sunday’s sale suggests that the steady climb in first
growth Bordeaux is finally leveling out. “Before prices were
getting pretty insane,” said Serena Sutcliff, head of
International Wine for Sotheby’s. “Today there was some good
value.”  Bidding for Chinese paintings remained robust as new buyers
entered the market, said European collector Rainer Moegling.  “There are still so many people in China who are starting
to see art as an alternative investment,” said Shanghai-based
Moegling, who bought three paintings at Sunday’s evening sale.
“Most things are selling and prices aren’t going down.”  Zeng’s Art  On Sunday evening, the top lot of the contemporary Chinese
art sale was a painting by  Zeng Fanzhi , which sold for $HK20.3
million, compared with a high estimate of HK$20 million that
doesn’t include the buyer’s premium.  The sale of 90 works amassed by Guy Ullens, founder of
Beijing’s largest private art museum, raised HK$132.4 million
with 93 percent of the lots sold.  Sotheby’s autumn sale series has 200 fewer lots than its
April auction in the city, which took a record HK$3.49 billion,
compared with an estimate of HK$2.7 billion, the auction house
said. The star lot in the spring sale, an 18th-century Chinese
vase worth more than $23 million, failed to find a buyer.  In today’s auction, an oil by  Zhang Xiaogang  from his
Bloodline series has a high estimate of $8.3 million, according
to the catalog. At Sotheby’s April sale in the city, Zhang’s
triptych “Forever Lasting Love” fetched HK$79 million with
fees, more than double the HK$30 million top estimate.  Zao Abstract  In today’s sale of 20th-century Chinese Art, an abstract
landscape oil painted by Zao Wou-ki in 1968 sold for an artist
record HK$68.98 million, compared with a high estimate of HK$35
million, Sotheby’s said. Sotheby’s is also offering 36 works by
 Zhang Daqian .  Buyer’s premium, the commission added to the hammer price
of works sold, is 25 percent for the first HK$400,000, 20
percent for lots fetching as much as HK$8 million, and 12
percent above that. The wine premium is a flat 21 percent.
Estimates reflect the hammer price, before premium.  Potential buyers who aren’t represented at the  Hong Kong
Convention and Exhibition Centre  sale can bid via Sotheby’s
 online bidding system .  To contact the reporter on this story:
