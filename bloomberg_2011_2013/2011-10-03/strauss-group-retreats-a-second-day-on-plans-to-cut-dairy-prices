Strauss Group Ltd. (STRS)  declined for a
second day after the company that derives about a fifth of its
revenue from dairy products said yesterday it will lower the
price of some of its  milk products  by 12 percent.  The shares retreated 2 percent to 44.10 shekels at 11:31
a.m. in  Tel Aviv , bringing the two-day drop to 9.2 percent, the
biggest such decline in three weeks.  The stock lost 6.5 percent in the third quarter amid
consumer demonstrations over the high cost of living that
started with protests about the price of cottage cheese.
 Israel â€™s cabinet today is due to discuss recommendations of a
government-appointed panel to address living costs, including
opening markets to more imports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
