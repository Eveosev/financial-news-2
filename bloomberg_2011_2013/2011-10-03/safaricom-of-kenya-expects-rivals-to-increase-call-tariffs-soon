Safaricom Ltd. (SAFCOM) , the Kenyan mobile-
phone operator that increased its call rates for the first time
in 11 years on Oct. 1, expects rival operators to raise their
tarrifs “soon,” Chief Financial Officer Chris Tiffin said.  The company plans to maintain its current rate of
investment spending for the next four to five years, Tiffin said
at an investor conference in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
