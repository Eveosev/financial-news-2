Motech Industries Inc. (6244) , a Taiwanese
solar-energy company, surged the most in a month in Taipei, on
speculation the company could get more orders from a forum this
week, said Chen Chih-Chung, an analyst at Jih Sun Securities Co.  The stock jumped 6.5 percent to NT$52.60 as of 11:04 a.m.,
the biggest advance since Sept. 1. Motech Chief Executive
Officer PH Chang is attending the annual Taiwan International
Photovoltaic Forum and Exhibition, which is being held from Oct.
5 to Oct 7, according to the forum’s website. The conference
hosted 251 companies in 2010, the website said. Jack Hsieh, a
Motech spokesman, didn’t immediately answer calls to his office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
