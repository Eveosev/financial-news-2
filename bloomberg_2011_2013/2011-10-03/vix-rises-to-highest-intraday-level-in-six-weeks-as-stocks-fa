The benchmark index for U.S. stock
options advanced to its highest intraday level since Aug. 19, as
U.S. equities dropped on concern officials are failing to
contain the Greek debt crisis.  The  Chicago  Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or
VIX, jumped 3.5 percent to 44.48, the highest since August 19,
at 2:28 p.m. in  New York . The index measures the cost of using
options as insurance against drops in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index, which slid 2.2 percent to 1,107.15. Volatility gauges
rose worldwide as European finance ministers meet to consider
how to shield banks from the debt crisis and boost the region’s
rescue fund after  Greece  missed a deficit target for 2012.  “People are nervous about the market, still,” Luke Rahbari, a VIX options trader at Stutland Equities LLC in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “There’s a lot of fear
out there and uncertainty, and that’s why the VIX continues to
go up higher and higher.”  The VIX on Aug. 8 closed at a 29-month high of 48, and
remains above its 21-year historical average of 20.46. In
 Europe , the  VStoxx Index (V2X) , which measures the cost of protection
against Euro Stoxx 50 Index losses, climbed 4.2 percent to 48.65
today. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Volatility Index advanced 2.9
percent to 44, while India’s Nifty 50 Index volatility gauge
surged 9.8 percent to 35.07, close to Sept. 26’s 35.43, its
highest level since August 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
