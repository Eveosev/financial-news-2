Springland International Holdings
Ltd. (1700) , an operator of retail stores and supermarkets in China,
signed a $150 million three-year term loan with 14 banks, said a
person familiar with the matter.  DBS Bank Ltd.. the loanâ€™s mandated lead arranger and
bookrunner, was joined by Allied Banking Corp.,  Bank of East
Asia Ltd. (23) , Cathay United Bank Co.,  Chang Hwa Commercial Bank (2801) ,
China Development Industrial Bank Inc., First Commercial Bank
Co., Hua Nan Commercial Bank Ltd., Hwatai Bank Ltd.,  Industrial
Bank of Taiwan (2897) , Jih Sun International Commercial Bank Co., Land
