Ali Tarhouni will retain control of
 Libya ’s oil and finance portfolios in a shakeup of the National
Transitional Council’s executive board, NTC Chairman Mustafa Abdel Jalil said.  Abdullah Shammiyah will be in charge of the economy,
Mahmoud Jibril will continue to head the NTC executive board,
which serves as a cabinet, and will also take responsibility for
foreign affairs, Abdel Jalil said in a televised news conference
in the eastern city of Benghazi today. Mahmoud Shammam will be
in charge of media and information.  Creating jobs and income will be the priorities for the
board, which will investigate allegations of human-rights
violations during the seven-month uprising against Muammar Qaddafi’s rule, Abdel Jalil said.  Jibril was asked to restructure the executive organization
on Aug. 8 after the July 28 killing of the council’s military
chief, Abdel Fattah Younis, which remains unexplained.  The NTC’s drive to consolidate its authority in Libya is
being hampered by political infighting and the doggedness of
Qaddafi’s supporters in their last two strongholds, Bani Walid
and Sirte.  To contact the reporter on this story:
