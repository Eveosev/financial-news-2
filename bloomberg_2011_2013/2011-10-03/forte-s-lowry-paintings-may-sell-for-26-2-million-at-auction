A collection of paintings by  L.S.
Lowry  formed by the U.K. caterer and hotelier, the late Charles Forte, is estimated to raise as much as 16.9 million pounds
($26.2 million) at an auction in London next month.  Lowry (1887-1976) was a Lancashire-born artist best known
for his industrial scenes inhabited by crowds of stick-like
figures. Forte’s descendants will be offering 14 of these
paintings at Christie’s International on Nov. 16, the London-
based auction house said today in an e-mailed statement.  “ Piccadilly Circus , London,” is the most highly valued
work in the group, estimated at 4 million pounds to 6 million
pounds. It dates from 1960 and has never been offered at auction
before. The 1953 oil “Fun Fair at Daisy Nook” is priced at 1.5
million pounds to 2 million pounds.  Forte bought the paintings during the 1960s, ’70s and ’80s.
Lowry continues to be a favorite name with wealthy collectors of
20th-century British art. In May, Christie’s achieved a record
auction price of 5.6 million pounds for a 1949 painting, “The
Football Match.”  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
