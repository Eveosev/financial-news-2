Hong Kong sustained its retail sales
boom even amid financial market turmoil, supported by shoppers
from  China  and a low  unemployment rate .  Sales surged 29 percent in August from a year earlier to
HK$34.3 billion ($4.4 billion), the government said on its
website today. That compared with a 29.1 percent gain in July
that was the biggest on record excluding January and February
figures distorted by a Lunar New Year holiday.  Hong Kong’s benchmark  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  fell 4.4 percent
today, after last week completing its steepest quarterly drop
since 2001, as Europe’s debt crisis and signs of a slowdown in
China drag down investor confidence. Market turbulence seems yet
to have dented spending by China’s tourists, with nearly 3
million visitor arrivals from the country in August.  “Sustained job creation and wage growth, plus solid
mainland Chinese consumer demand, are supporting retail sales,”
Donna Kwok, a Hong Kong-based economist at HSBC Holdings Plc.,
said before today’s report. Sales may cool “if global financial
market turbulence continues to run on unabated,” she said.  The city’s unemployment rate for the three months ended
August fell to 3.2 percent, the lowest level since 1998.  By volume, retail sales gained 20.7 percent in August from
a year earlier, according to the government’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
