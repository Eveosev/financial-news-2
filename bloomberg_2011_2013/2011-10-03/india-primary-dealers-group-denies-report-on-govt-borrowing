The Primary Dealers Association of
 India  denied a newspaper report that a central bank official
told its annual general meeting last week the government may
have to borrow as much as 1 trillion rupees ($20 billion) more
than budgeted.  “No such statement was made by any  Reserve Bank  of India
official,” Pradeep Madhav, chairman of the PDAI, said in a
telephone interview today. The Times of India newspaper today
reported that “top RBI officials” indicated the government of
India may have to increase borrowings for the year ending March
2012 by up to 1 percent of gross domestic product.  To contact the reporter on this story:
