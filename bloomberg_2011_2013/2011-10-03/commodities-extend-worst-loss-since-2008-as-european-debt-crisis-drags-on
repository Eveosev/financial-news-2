Commodities fell to a 10-month low on
increasing concern that stagnant global growth will crimp demand
for metals, energy and agriculture.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index dropped 5.38, or 0.9
percent, to close at 585.62, after touching 580.22, the lowest
since Dec. 1. The gauge tumbled 12 percent in the third quarter,
the most since the final quarter of 2008.  Global equities slumped on concern that  Europe ’s debt
crisis will worsen and derail expansion. The GSCI Index has lost
more than 20 percent since reaching an almost three-year high in
April as slowing growth reduced the chances of shortages for raw
materials. Money managers cut bets on a commodity rally 26
percent in the week to Sept. 27, the most in almost three years,
government data show.  “People are worried about a global slowdown and a double
dip,”  Donald Selkin , the chief market strategist at National
Securities Corp. in  New York , said today in a telephone
interview. “Funds are selling.”  Investors withdrew $1.08 billion from commodity funds in
the week ending Sept. 28, the most in more than a month,
according to data from EPFR Global, a Cambridge, Massachusetts-
based research company.  Declines in crude oil, coffee and gasoil lead losses in
commodities today.  Crude-oil futures for November delivery fell $1.59 to
$77.61 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
settlement since Sept. 28, 2010. Prices have dropped 15 percent
this year.  Arabica coffee for December delivery dropped as much as 4
percent to $2.198 a pound on ICE Futures U.S., the lowest since
Dec. 17.  To contact the reporters on this story:
