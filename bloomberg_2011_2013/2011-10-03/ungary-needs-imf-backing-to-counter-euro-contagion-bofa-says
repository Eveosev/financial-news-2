Hungary needs a precautionary standby
loan agreement with the  International Monetary Fund  to defend
against contagion from a potential worsening of the euro crisis,
 Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  economist  Raffaella Tenconi  said.  Prime Minister Viktor Orban may “reassess” his opposition
to an IMF agreement if global conditions deteriorate, the
London-based Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist said in an
e-mail today.  While the central bank is currently opposed to immediate
interest rate increases, the risk remains that an “emergency”
rate rise may be needed to counter the impact from potential
contagion, Tenconi said. There are risks the government will
overshoot its budget deficit target next year, she said.  A downgrade of Hungary’s credit to junk would have
“severe” consequences because of the country’s reliance on
foreign bond investors, Tenconi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
