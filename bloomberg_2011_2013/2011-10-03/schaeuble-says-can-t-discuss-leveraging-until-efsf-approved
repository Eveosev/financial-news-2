German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said euro-area countries should wait until changes to
the European Financial Stability Facility are ratified before
discussing an increase to its capacity.  “We will wait until the other countries that haven’t
ratified it also do so,” Schaeuble told reporters in Luxembourg
today. He said speculation about whether the bailout fund will
need to be enlarged or leveraged “makes no sense” at this
time.  Finance ministers from the single currency’s 17 members are
gathered in Luxembourg to weigh how to step up their responses
to Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis. Of those countries, 14 states
including  Germany  have approved changes made in July allowing
the bailout fund to purchase bonds on secondary markets and
channel funds to banks.  Schaeuble called on Slovakia, which has yet to approve the
deal, to “meet its responsibility” when its parliament votes
on the package.  “I hope that they know that they are deciding not just for
themselves, but also for all in  Europe ,” he said. “Solidarity
in Europe is always about reciprocity.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
