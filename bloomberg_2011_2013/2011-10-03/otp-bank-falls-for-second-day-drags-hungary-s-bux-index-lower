OTP Bank Nyrt.,  Hungary ’s biggest
lender, fell for a second day, dragging the benchmark BUX index
lower, as concern that Hungarian local and regional governments
will default on debt worsened a slump in European equities.  OTP weakened 4.9 percent to 3,090 forint as of 9:53 a.m. in
Budapest. The BUX gauge, in which OTP has a 25 percent
weighting, fell 2.2 percent to 15,424.17. Hungary’s currency
depreciated 0.2 percent to 294 per euro.  The government will begins talks aimed at restructuring
local and regional authorities’ debt, Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  said today, adding that banks are “stretched to their
limits.” European stocks and commodities dropped, the euro fell
to an eight-month low versus the dollar and bond risk rose as
data signaled global economic growth is slowing and European
officials prepared to weigh the risk of a Greek default.  Hungary’s government bonds maturing in 2017 weakened for a
fourth day, lifting the yield 3 basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 7.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
