Life insurers in  California  must
receive approval from beneficiaries before keeping death-benefit
payments in retained-asset accounts, under a state law signed
yesterday by Governor  Jerry Brown .  The law requires insurers to get a written declaration from
beneficiaries on how they want to receive payments, according to
Dave Jones, the state insurance commissioner. If a beneficiary
doesn’t make a choice, the insurer may issue a retained-asset
account only if it has clearly disclosed its intention to do so.  Insurers have drawn fire from government officials since
Bloomberg Markets magazine reported last year that carriers
profit by holding and investing $28 billion owed to
beneficiaries in so-called retained-asset accounts.  Retained-asset accounts were created as “a compassionate
response” to beneficiaries’ needs, Jack Dolan, a spokesman for
the  American Council of Life Insurers , said last year. The
products give grieving families time to decide what to do with
their payouts, the ACLI said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
