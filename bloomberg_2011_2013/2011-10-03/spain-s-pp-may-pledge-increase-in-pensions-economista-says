Opposition leader  Mariano Rajoy  plans
to pledge an increase to Spanish pensions for next year if he
wins the election on Nov. 20, El Economista reported, without
saying where it got the information.  Pensions will rise at least in line with the 3 percent
inflation rate if the PP wins, the newspaper said. Rajoy plans
to make the announcement at a party conference in Malaga this
week, El Economista said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
