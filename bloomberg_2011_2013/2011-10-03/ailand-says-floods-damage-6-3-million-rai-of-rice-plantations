Flooding in  Thailand  has damaged
about 6.3 million rai of the nation’s rice plantations, the farm
ministry said.  Of that total, 868,057 rai of rice plantations have been
devastated, the ministry said today on its website.  Thailand, the world’s biggest rice exporter, cultivates the
grain over about 62 million rai, according to data from the
Office of Agricultural Economics. Heavy rain since July 25 has
caused flooding in 58 of the country’s 77 provinces, killing at
least 212 people, according to the government.  Of the damaged rice plantations, 46 percent are in
Thailand’s northeastern provinces, 41 percent in northern
provinces and 8.2 percent in central provinces. The north and
northeast account for about 70 percent of total production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
