Aston Resources Ltd. (AZT) , an Australian
coking coal developer, agreed to sell a 10 percent stake in its
Maules Creek coal project for A$370 million ($357 million) to
 Japan ’s Electric Power Development Co. Ltd.  Once the transaction is completed, Aston “would have the
majority of the funds required to develop the project,” Chief
Executive Officer Todd Hannigan of Brisbane-based Aston said in
a statement to the Australian stock exchange.  Aston sold a 15 percent stake in the mine, which will
produce a majority of steelmaking coal, to Japan’s Itochu Corp.
for A$345 million in December, valuing the project at the time
at A$2.3 billion. The agreement with Electric Power Development,
also known as J-Power, values Maules Creek at A$3.7 billion,
reflecting higher coal prices following flooding this year in
 Australia  and a refocus on coal as a source of energy in Japan
following the March 11 tsunami and nuclear disaster.  Output from the mine, that may cost A$651 million, will
start in mid-2013, the company said today in a separate
presentation.  The stake sale includes a long-term thermal coal offtake
agreement with J-Power, subject to agreement by Itochu, Aston
said in the statement. Itochu also has a right to match the
terms of the asset sale agreement, Aston said.  Aston fell 1 percent to A$9.96 at the 4:10 p.m. close of
Sydney trading, compared with a 2.8 percent drop in the
benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
