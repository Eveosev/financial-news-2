Raymond James Financial Inc. (RJF)  and BR
Partners, a Brazilian financial advisory company founded by
former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executives, signed an operating
agreement, said a person with knowledge of the accord.  The two firms will work together in capital markets deals
and will also exchange research, said the person, who asked not
to be identified because the agreement hasn’t been publicly
announced.  The agreement doesn’t involve any kind of equity ownership,
said the person.   Officials from  Raymond James , based in Saint Petersburg,
Florida, and BR Partners, based in Sao Paulo, declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
