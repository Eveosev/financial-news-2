India ’s manufacturing grew in
September at the slowest pace in 2 1/2 years after the central
bank’s record interest-rate increases.  The Purchasing Managers’ Index was at 50.4 from 52.6 in
August, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said in an e-
mailed statement today. That’s the weakest reading since March
2009. A number above 50 indicates expansion.  The  Reserve Bank of India  last week signaled it may
maintain its tight monetary policy after Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said inflation remains above the acceptable level. In
 China , a manufacturing index advanced for a second month,
suggesting the world’s second-largest economy is weathering
Premier Wen Jiabao’s steps to check price gains.  “Inflation control would continue to be the dominant theme
and goal in India,”  Ramya Suryanarayanan , an economist at DBS
Group Holdings Ltd. in  Singapore , said before the report. “The
sheer size of the rupee’s move makes imports costly and adds to
price pressure.”  She expects the central bank to increase its repurchase
rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 8.5 percent by the
end of December. Subbarao has raised the benchmark rate 12 times
since mid-March 2010 by a total of 350 basis points, the fastest
round of increases since the Reserve Bank was established in
1935, Bloomberg data show.  Rupee Falls  The Indian rupee has weakened 9.5 percent against the
dollar this year, the biggest drop in a basket of 10 Asian
currencies excluding  Japan ’s yen, according to Bloomberg data,
as investors sold emerging-market assets on concern  Europe ’s
debt crisis may undermine the global economy.  The currency fell 0.9 percent to 49.38 as of 12.21 p.m. in
Mumbai today. The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index slumped
2.2 percent. The yield on the 7.8 percent securities due April
2021 gained 7 basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 8.51
percent.  India’s benchmark wholesale-price inflation accelerated to
a 13-month high of 9.78 percent in August.  Inflation may accelerate after Indian Oil Corp., the
country’s biggest refiner, raised gasoline prices in September
for the second time in four months. Losses from selling fuels
below cost are increasing following the rupee’s decline against
the dollar, according to the company’s Finance Director P.K.
Goyal.  India needs to control rising prices to protect purchasing
power and sustain growth, the  Reserve Bank  has said.  ‘Comfort Range’  A rate of 4 percent to 6 percent is the “short-term
comfort range” for inflation, Subbarao said Sept. 26. He said
inflation will slow by March 2012, “but more slowly than
initially expected.” Subbarao in July predicted inflation to
ease to 7 percent by March 31.  The China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said Oct.
1 that the Purchasing Managers’ Index for September rose to 51.2
from 50.9, showing the economy is withstanding the government’s
campaign against inflation that has included higher  interest
rates , lending curbs and home-purchase limits.  In  Australia , a gauge of manufacturing fell for a third
month in September as a surging currency hurt exports and the
highest borrowing costs in the developed world curbed domestic
demand.  The  International Monetary Fund  last month cut its forecast
for India’s economic growth. The South Asian economy will expand
7.8 percent in 2011, the Washington-based lender said, slower
than the 8.2 percent projected in June. For 2012, it lowered its
estimate to 7.5 percent from 7.8 percent.  Merchandise exports growth slowed in August, gaining 44.3
percent to $24.3 billion from a year earlier, according to an e-
mailed statement from the commerce ministry today. Exports
jumped 81.8 percent in July, the biggest increase since at least
April 1995, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
