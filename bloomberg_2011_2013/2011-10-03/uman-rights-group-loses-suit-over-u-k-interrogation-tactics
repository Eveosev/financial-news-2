An Iraqi man won a U.K. court ruling
over the practice of placing bags over terror suspects’ heads
during overseas interrogations.  Judge Anthony May said there shouldn’t be any circumstances
in which ‘hooding,’ which has already been banned by British
armed forces, was permitted. May said that guidelines should be
strengthened to “rule out” the possibility of security
officials permitting the practice, even when carried out by
foreign governments.  The case was filed by an Iraqi man who said he was subject
to the practice by British forces. The court rejected a related
case filed by a U.K. human rights agency over the interrogation
of suspects overseas.  May dismissed the Equality and Human Rights Commission’s
request for a judicial review of the guidance, issued by Prime
Minister  David Cameron  in 2010 to ensure soldiers and security
staff didn’t condone or encourage torture by foreign officials.
The commission said the guidelines don’t prevent intelligence
officers from seeking information from suspects where there is a
serious risk of torture.  In July 2010 the British government set up an independent
inquiry into allegations security officials had been implicated
in the mistreatment of detainees held abroad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
