Vivendi SA (VIV)  Chief Executive Officer
Jean-Bernard Levy said the French media company is
“interested” in  TVN SA (TVN) , Poland’s largest television network.  TVN said July 7 that majority owner ITI Holdings SA may
sell its 56 percent stake in the company.  Time Warner Inc. (TWX) , the
owner of CNN news channel, and RTL Group SA, Europe’s largest
broadcaster, are interested in bidding, according to reports
from  Gazeta Wyborcza  and Handelsblatt in August. Poland is one
of Europe’s fastest-growing markets and was the only country in
the European Union to avoid recession in 2009.  The Rzeczpospolita newspaper said today that Vivendi was
looking for a partner with expertise in the Polish market to
bolster its offer, citing an interview with Vivendi supervisory
board Chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou.  Levy, who spoke to a Bloomberg reporter during a conference
in Brussels today, confirmed Paris-based Vivendi’s interest in
Warsaw-based TVN and declined to comment further.  Vivendi declined 1.1 percent to 15.17 euros in Paris
trading as of 11:37 a.m. local time. TVN fell 2.2 percent to
14.03 zloty in Warsaw, extending its decline this year to 18
percent.  In addition to television operations including flagship
channel TVN, the Polish company owns the country’s biggest
Internet portal Onet.pl and satellite-television operator N.  To contact the reporters on this story:
