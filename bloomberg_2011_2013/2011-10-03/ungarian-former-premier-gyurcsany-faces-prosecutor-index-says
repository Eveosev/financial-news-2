Ferenc Gyurcsany will become the
first Hungarian former prime minister to be questioned by
authorities as a suspect since the countryâ€™s transition from
communism to democracy more than two decades ago, Index said.  Gyurcsany is accused of abuse of power in a real estate
deal which would have been part of an investment to build a
casino in central  Hungary , the news portal  reported , without
citing anyone. He will be questioned by prosecutors at 1 p.m.
today in Budapest, Index said.  Gyurcsany has denied the charges and has said the
investigation is politically motivated, Index said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
