Ghana ’s cedi declined to the weakest
on record as manufacturers and traders bought dollars to import
raw materials and goods to the West African nation.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
depreciated for a fourth day, losing as much as 0.5 percent to
1.6033 per dollar, the weakest level since at least 1994, when
Bloomberg started compiling the data. It traded down 0.2 percent
to 1.5995 per dollar as of 1:08 p.m. in Accra, the capital,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There is still demand for dollars on the market from the
manufacturing and the commerce industry,” Othniel Kwainoe, a
currency trader at the Ghanaian unit of Standard Chartered Bank
Plc, said in a telephone interview. “What the central bank will
do will be most critical at this point.” Inflows of dollars
from exporters were “woefully inadequate,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
