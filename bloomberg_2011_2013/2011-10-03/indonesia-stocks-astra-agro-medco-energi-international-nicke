Shares of the following companies had
unusual moves in Indonesian trading. Stock symbols are in

percent to 5,300 rupiah. Financial shares were the biggest drag
on the composite index today.  Citigroup Inc. cut the share-price estimates of Bank
Mandiri, Bank Rakyat and three other banks to “reflect higher
risks following currency and bond-price volatility,” Salman Ali
and Robert P. Kong, analysts at Citigroup, wrote in a Sept. 30
note.  Energy companies: PT Medco Energi Internasional (MEDC IJ),
 Indonesia ’s biggest listed oil company, fell 9.3 percent to

trillion rupiah ($123 million) of dollar bonds this year because
of market conditions. President Director Tri Ramadi couldn’t be
reached when called at his office to confirm the report.  PT Astra Agro Lestari (AALI IJ), Indonesia’s biggest listed
