Markit Economics today released the September
HSBC manufacturing purchasing managersâ€™ index for the
 Czech Republic . The Manufacturing PMI is designed to provide a
single figure snap-shot for Czech manufacturing. It is based on a
survey of purchasing executives in industrial companies.
and is designed to provide the most up-to-date picture of
business conditions. Anything above 50 indicates expansion;
below 50, a contraction. The greater the divergence
from 50, the greater the rate of change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
