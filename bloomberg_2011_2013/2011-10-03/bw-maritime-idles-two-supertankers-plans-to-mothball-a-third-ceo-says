BW Maritime, a Singapore-based owner
of 15 supertankers, said it temporarily idled two of the vessels
and is mothballing a third for a longer duration as earnings
plunge to the lowest since at least 1997.  “In the short term we are holding them back because we
feel rates are too low,” Chief Executive Officer Andreas Sohmen-Pao said by phone today from  London . A third 1994-built
supertanker is being removed for a longer duration, a process
known as cold lay up, he said.  Earnings from the vessels averaged the lowest since at
least 1997 in the third quarter, according to Clarkson Research
Services Ltd., a unit of the world’s largest shipbroker. They
made $11,372 a day in the three months to September, down from
$25,928 a year earlier, its data show.  The supertankers being temporarily idled are the BW Lotus
and the BW Peony, Sohmen-Pao said. Both are in a bay in
 Malaysia , according to ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.
The BW Stadt is the one that will be removed from trading for a
longer duration. Earnings from the ships are “dangerously
low,” he said in August, adding the company was declining
charters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
