Spain ’s People’s Party would press to
reduce the value-added  tax rate  applied to tourism activities if
it wins elections on Nov. 20, Cinco Dias reported.  At present, hotels, bars and restaurants pay a reduced VAT
rate of 8 percent and the PP’s aim is to cut it to a “super-
reduced” rate of 4 percent, the newspaper said, without saying
where it got the information.  The main problem would be that cutting VAT for tourism
would hit government revenue, leading the PP to lobby for a
single reduced rate across the EU, the newspaper said.
