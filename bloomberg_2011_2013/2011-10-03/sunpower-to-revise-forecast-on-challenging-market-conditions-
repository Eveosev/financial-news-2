SunPower Corp. (SPWRA) , a solar panel company
majority-owned by  Total SA (FP) , will revise its forecast for the
year due to “challenging market conditions.”  The company didn’t say how it will adjust its 2011 revenue
and income forecast, which it will disclose during its third-
quarter earnings call Nov. 3,  San Jose , California-based
SunPower said today in a statement.  “Challenging market conditions continue to impact our
global residential and commercial business,” Chief Financial
Officer Dennis Arriola said in the statement. “As a result, we
will revise our 2011 revenue and earnings outlook.”  SunPower said in August its 2011 net loss would be 50 cents
to $1 a share on sales of $2.8 billion to $2.95 billion.
Analysts expect a net loss of 74 cents and sales of $2.83
billion, the average of 27 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  SunPower also said it closed a $275 million two-year
revolving loan and a $200 million letter of credit. The shares
have declined 37 percent this year, giving the company a market
value of $807 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
