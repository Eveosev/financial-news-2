Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP,
ranked seventh by American Lawyer magazine in profits per
partner, began practicing  Hong Kong  law to enhance its existing
practice based there and in Beijing.  Hong Kong law services will be offered from both the Hong
Kong and Beijing offices, the New York-based firm said in a
statement. The Hong Kong office, in operation since 1993, only
advised on U.S. and English law until Sept. 30.  “The formal launch of our Hong Kong law capability
demonstrates the firm’s commitment to the greater China
region,” Pete Ruegger, chairman of the firm’s executive
committee, said in a  statement . “The ability to advise clients
on Hong Kong law as well as U.S. law further strengthens Simpson
Thacher’s market leading position.”  The number of lawyers who will offer counsel on Hong Kong
law in that office is still being determined, said Emily
Deissler, Simpson Thacher spokeswoman, in an e-mail.  The practice will be led by partner  Christopher Wong  and
Celia Lam, who is becoming a partner. Both have decades of Hong
Kong law experience advising clients on capital markets and
mergers and acquisitions transactions, the firm said in its
statement.  The  law firm , with about 800 attorneys in its network, has
10 offices, including  Tokyo ,  London , Sao Paulo and five in the
U.S., according to its  website .  To contact the reporters on this story:
