The Australian dollar dropped to its
lowest level in a year against the U.S. currency as a statement
by the  Reserve Bank  of Australia suggested an easing of
inflation pressures may pave the way for an interest-rate cut.  The Aussie slid for a third day against the yen as traders
priced in an 82 percent chance the central bank will cut
 interest rates  by one-half percentage point to 4.25 percent by
November. New Zealand’s currency also fell against the U.S.
dollar as global stocks dropped, damping demand for assets
linked to growth.  “The RBA is opening the door to a rate cut and that should
put some downward pressure on the Australian dollar,” said
 Richard Grace , the Sydney-based chief foreign-exchange
strategist and head of international economics at Commonwealth
Bank of Australia. “With equity markets continuing to remain
very soft, I’d suggest that the Aussie is at risk of falling
below 90 cents.”  Australia ’s dollar sank as low as 93.88 U.S. cents, the
least since September 2010, before trading at 94.41 cents as of
11:19 p.m. in  New York  from 95.27 yesterday. It fell to 72.56
yen from 73.01 yen after reaching 72.06, the lowest since May
2010. New Zealand’s dollar fell 0.2 percent to 75.13 U.S. cents
after earlier dropping to as low as 74.70 cents, the weakest
since March 24. It gained to 57.74 yen from 57.69 yen.  The MSCI Asia Pacific index of shares slid 1.5 percent and
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.5 percent.  “Taking into account all the recent information, the path
for inflation may now be more consistent with the 2-3 percent
target in 2012 and 2013,” RBA Governor  Glenn Stevens  said in a
statement accompanying the board’s decision to leave rates
unchanged at 4.75 percent. “An improved inflation outlook would
increase the scope for monetary policy to provide some support
to demand, should that prove necessary.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
