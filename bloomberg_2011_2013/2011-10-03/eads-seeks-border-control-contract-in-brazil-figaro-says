European Aeronautic, Defence & Space
Co.’s defense unit is seeking to win a border-surveillance
contract in  Brazil  valued at 7.5 billion euros ($10 billion)
over five years, Le Figaro reported on its website, citing the
president of the division.  Brazil wants to boost security in the country before
hosting the soccer World Cup tournament in 2014 and the Olympic
Games in 2016, the French newspaper said.  EADS’s defense unit, Cassidian, has already won a contract
in that country to provide the police with secure
communications, the paper said.  Cassidian in 2010 created a joint venture with Odebrecht
SA, a diversified conglomerate, which intends to compete for the
border contract and the company ’’doesn’t exclude’’ a tie-up
with France’s  Thales SA (HO) , the paper cited EADS Chief Executive
Louis Gallois as saying.  To contact the reporters on this story:
