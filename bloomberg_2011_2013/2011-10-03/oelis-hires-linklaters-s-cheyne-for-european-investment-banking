Moelis & Co., the investment bank
founded by Kenneth Moelis, hired David Cheyne from Linklaters
LLP as vice chairman of  investment banking  for Europe, the
Middle East and Africa.  Cheyne, who was a senior partner at the law firm and based
in London, will provide counsel on deal execution, Moelis said
today in a statement.  During his career at Linklaters, Cheyne advised BP Plc in
acquiring Amoco Corp., Vodafone Group Plc in its purchase of
AirTouch Communications Inc. and Mannesmann AG, and Billiton Plc
in its merger with BHP Ltd., according to Moelis’s statement.  The move to hire Cheyne underscores the firm’s expansion
since it was founded in 2007 by Moelis, a former banker at UBS
AG. New York-based Moelis has attracted bankers from firms such
as  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG
and UBS, and now employs more than 570 people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
