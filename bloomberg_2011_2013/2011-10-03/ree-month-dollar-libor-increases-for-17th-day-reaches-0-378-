The rate at which London-based banks
say they can borrow for three months in dollars rose for a 17th
day, reaching the highest level since August 2010.  The  London  interbank offered rate, or Libor, for dollar
loans climbed to 0.37761 percent from 0.37433 percent at the end
of last week, according to data from the British Bankers’
Association. That’s the highest rate since Aug. 11, 2010.  The dollar Libor-OIS spread, a gauge of banks’ reluctance
to lend, widened to 28.96 basis points at 12:36 p.m. in London,
from 28.58 on Sept. 30. That’s the widest on a closing-price
basis since July 27, 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The TED spread, or the difference between what lenders and
the U.S. government pay to borrow for three months, widened to
36.24 basis points from 35.40 basis points. It reached 36.53 on
Sept. 23, the highest level since July 20, 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
