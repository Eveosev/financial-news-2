Siemens AG,  Europe ’s largest
engineering company, extended the remit of its industrial
equipment chief, Daryl Dulaney, giving him responsibility for
its newly formed infrastructure and cities sector in  North
America .  Dulaney will oversee the region’s business offering
controls for areas including buildings, smart grids and
transportation networks, the Munich-based company said in a
statement today.  The promotion follows Dulaney’s appointment to the head of
the industrial-gear segment in 2009, after 30 years with the
German maker of health scanners, trains and power turbines.
Siemens announced plans to create an infrastructure and cities
sector earlier this year to pull together products like trains,
mail-sorting systems and traffic controls.  To contact the reporter on this story:
