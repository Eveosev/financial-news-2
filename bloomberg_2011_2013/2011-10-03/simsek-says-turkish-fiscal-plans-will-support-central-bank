Turkey’s budget plans will provide
support to the central bank and help keep the inflation rate
below 10 percent, Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek said.  While the fall in the value of the lira may have a short-
term impact on inflation, falling domestic demand means the
pass-through will be limited and there’s no medium-term danger
to inflation, Simsek said in televised remarks from Ankara
today.  Officials worked through the weekend on the country’s new
medium-term economic plans, which will be announced at a news
conference when they’re ready, Simsek said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
