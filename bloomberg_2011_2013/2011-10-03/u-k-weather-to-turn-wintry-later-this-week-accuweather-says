U.K. weather will turn wintry later
this week, with sleet and snow in Scotland and northern  England ,
as a cold front brings an end to above-normal warmth, forecaster
AccuWeather Inc. said.  Maximum temperatures across Scotland,  Northern Ireland , the
north of England and much of Wales from Oct. 6 will range from 9
to 14 degrees Celsius (48-57 Fahrenheit), with heavy showers
bringing snow, sleet or small hail in hilly areas, AccuWeather
wrote in a  report  on its website today.  “Record-setting warmth will yield to a true fall chill,”
 Jim Andrews , a senior meteorologist at AccuWeather, wrote in the
report. “Temperatures will step back significantly on Tuesday
after Monday’s parting shot of summery warmth. The big shift,
however, will happen with the passing of a strong cold front,
between Wednesday and Thursday.”  Temperatures will go from about 3 to 6 degrees Celsius
above normal to 1 to 3 degrees below, AccuWeather said.  The U.K.’s grain and oilseed harvest was largely completed,
with any remaining cereals, linseed and field beans in  Scotland 
expected to be brought in by the end of September, farm adviser
ADAS Holdings Ltd. reported last week. Planting of wheat and
barley was under way last week, ADAS said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
