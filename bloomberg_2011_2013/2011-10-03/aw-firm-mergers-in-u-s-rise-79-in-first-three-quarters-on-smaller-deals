Mergers among U.S. law firms rose
79 percent through the first three quarters of this year,
industry consultant Altman Weil Inc. said.  There were 14 law firm mergers and acquisitions announced
in the third quarter, according to Altman Weil’s MergerLine. The
majority of the deals involved acquisitions of firms with 35 or
fewer lawyers, continuing the trend toward smaller deals. There
were 43 deals announced from January to September, Altman Weil
said today in a statement.  “It looks like the law firm merger market is back,” Ward Bower, a consultant at  Newtown Square , Pennsylvania-based Altman
Weil, said in the statement. “This is the fourth strong quarter
in a row we’ve seen and we’re aware of a lot of activity in the
pipeline.”  Among the largest third-quarter deals is Boston-based
Edwards Angell Palmer & Dodge LLP’s acquisition of Wildman
Harrold Allen & Dixon, a 160-lawyer Chicago firm, according to
the statement. Also in the quarter, Indianapolis-based Ice
Miller LLP announced plans to merge with Schottenstein Zox &
Dunn Co. to create a firm with about 300 lawyers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
