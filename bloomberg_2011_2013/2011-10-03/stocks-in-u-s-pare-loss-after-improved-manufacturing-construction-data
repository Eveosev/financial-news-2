U.S. stocks rose, erasing early
losses, after reports on manufacturing industries and
construction spending topped estimates, tempering concern the
economic recovery was in jeopardy.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.3 percent to
1,132.27 at 10:11 a.m. in  New York  after slumping as much as 0.9
percent before the manufacturing data. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  climbed 32.51 points, or 0.3 percent, to 10,945.89.  The Institute for Supply Management’s factory index rose to
51.6 in September from 50.6 the prior month, the Tempe, Arizona-
based group said today. A reading of 50 is the dividing line
between expansion and contraction in manufacturing. Construction
spending in the U.S. unexpectedly rebounded in August, climbing
1.4 percent, Commerce Department figures showed.  The S&P 500 slipped 0.4 percent last week as the sovereign
debt crisis in  Europe  and fears of a global slowdown
overshadowed improving economic reports in the U.S. The S&P 500
tumbled 14 percent in the third quarter, the worst drop since
the three months ending December 2008. The index declined in
nine out 13 weeks during the quarter. For the year, the  S&P 500 
was down 10 percent through Sept. 30.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
