may convert its preferred shares in Brazilian shopping mall
company  Multiplan Empreendimentos Imobiliarios SA (MULT3)  into voting
shares, Valor Economico reported, citing Multiplan’s Investor
Relations Director Rodrigo Krause.  The conversion would give Multiplan the opportunity to list
its shares on the Novo Mercado section of the BM&FBovespa stock
