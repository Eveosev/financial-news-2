Indian stocks dropped, extending
their biggest quarterly loss in three years, on concern a
weakening local currency may make imports of oil and other
commodities expensive, raising raw-material costs for companies.  DLF Ltd. (DLFU) , the nation’s biggest property developer, plunged
8.8 percent, the steepest decline since November 2009. India’s
manufacturing expanded in September at the slowest pace in 2 1/2
years as higher borrowing costs cooled consumer demand, a report
by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics showed today.  ICICI
Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the largest non-state-owned lender, tumbled 4.2
percent, leading peers lower on concern further increases in
borrowing costs will hurt credit growth.  The BSE India Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost 284.03, or
1.7 percent to 16,169.73, according to preliminary closing
prices as of 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai, its lowest close in a week.
The gauge fell 13 percent in the three months ended Sept. 30,
the most since the quarter ended December 2008. The S&P CNX
Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange of  India  Ltd. lost
1.7 percent to 4,859.45.  To contact the reporter on this story:
