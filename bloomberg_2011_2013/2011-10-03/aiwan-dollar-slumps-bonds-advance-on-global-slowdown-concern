Taiwan ’s dollar fell to the lowest
level in 10 months and  government bonds  advanced on further
signs the world economic recovery is faltering.  The currency added to last week’s losses after overseas
investors sold $2.6 billion more Taiwanese equities than they
bought in September, a fifth month of net sales. Asian stocks
declined after reports on Sept. 30 showed growth in U.S.
consumer spending slowed in August, while incomes unexpectedly
dropped for the first time in almost two years.  “People shifted money to government bonds today because of
the bad performances in stocks,” said Ivy Leung, a Taipei-based
fixed-income trader at Polaris Securities Co. “The outlook for
bonds highly depends on the global economy.”  Taiwan’s dollar retreated 0.3 percent to NT$30.587 against
its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local close, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. It dropped to NT$30.672 earlier, the weakest
level since December.  The yield on the 1.25 percent notes due September 2021, the
most-traded  government securities , fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.264 percent, prices from Gretai
Securities Market show. That’s the lowest level for benchmark
10-year rates in five days.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.397 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
