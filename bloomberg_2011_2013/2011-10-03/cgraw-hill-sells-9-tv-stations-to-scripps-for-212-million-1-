McGraw-Hill Cos., the finance and
media company that is splitting in two, agreed to sell its nine
television stations to E.W. Scripps Co. for $212 million.  The stations, part of McGraw-Hill Broadcasting, include ABC
affiliates in Denver, Indianapolis,  San Diego  and Bakersfield,
 California , Cincinnati-based Scripps said today in a statement.
The other five are low-power stations associated with the
Spanish language network Azteca America.  McGraw-Hill, based in New York, said on June 14 it retained
 Morgan Stanley (MS)  to explore the sale of the broadcast group.
McGraw-Hill, which owns  Standard & Poor’s , has been reviewing
its operations since last year. On Sept. 12, the company said it
would split into two companies, one focused on financial
information and the other on education publishing.  “This divestiture will produce good value for a non-
strategic asset as we work to create two focused operating
companies,” Harold “Terry” McGraw, chief executive officer of
McGraw-Hill, said in an e-mailed statement.  McGraw-Hill fell $1.06 to $39.94 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The announcement was made
after markets closed and the stock was little changed in
extended trading.  Scripps fell 26 cents to $6.74 and also was little changed
afterward. The stations will add to the company’s portfolio of
six ABC stations, three NBC affiliates and one independent,
according to the statement. The company also operates newspapers
in 13 markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
