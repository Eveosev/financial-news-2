Chancellor of the Exchequer  George
Osborne  said he will stick to his deficit-reduction program and
not risk the backing of investors in order to spend money to
help the economy. He was speaking to the Conservative Party
conference in Manchester,  England , today.  “We’d be abandoning the stability other nations crave,”
Osborne said. “It’s an illusion that such sums would transform
the economy. You can’t borrow your way out of debt.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
