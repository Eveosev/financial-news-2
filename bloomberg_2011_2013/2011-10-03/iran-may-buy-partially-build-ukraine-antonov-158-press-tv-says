Iran  may purchase Antonov-158
passenger planes from Ukraine after one aircraft completed a
test flight in the Iranian capital yesterday, state-run  Press TV 
reported, without citing anyone.  If Iran purchases the aircraft some 30 percent of each
plane will be made in Iran, according to a report published late
yesterday on the news channelâ€™s website.  The twin-engined regional airliner can carry as many as 99
passengers, Press-TV said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
