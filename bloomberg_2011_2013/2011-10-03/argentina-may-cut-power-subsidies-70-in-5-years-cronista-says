Argentina ’s Planning Ministry is
working on a proposal to cut electricity subsidies as much as 70
percent over the next five years, El Cronista Comercial
reported, citing people it didn’t identify.  The government subsidizes energy in most Argentine
provinces to keep prices stable and would increase tariffs
gradually under the proposal, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper
said. A plan to implement the reduction will be presented to
President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner by year-end, Cronista
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
