Rubber production this year may gain
more than previously estimated, boosted by increased output from
 China ,  Indonesia  and Malaysia, according to the  Association of
Natural Rubber Producing Countries .  Production from its members, representing 92 percent of
global supply, is projected to grow 5.6 percent to 10 million
metric tons, the group said in a monthly bulletin today. It had
earlier forecast a rise of 5 percent to 9.96 million tons.  “Although the supply shows a marginal improvement compared
with what was previously assessed, concerns over availability of
natural rubber still persist,” said Jom Jacob, a senior
economist at the Kuala Lumpur-based association.  Rubber futures have lost 27 percent this year amid concerns
that a slowing U.S. economy and deepening European debt crisis
may curb demand for the commodity used for tires and gloves.
“While the natural rubber market may continue to stay fragile
in the short-term due to exogenous factors, the demand-supply
situation can hold the price,” Jacob said.  Output growth in the third quarter was revised up to 6.1
percent from 3.3 percent earlier, according to the group.  Consumption in China,  India  and  Malaysia , which account for
45 percent of the global demand, is likely to expand 2.7 percent
in the third quarter, an improvement from a contraction of 1
percent and 4.2 percent in the previous two quarters, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
