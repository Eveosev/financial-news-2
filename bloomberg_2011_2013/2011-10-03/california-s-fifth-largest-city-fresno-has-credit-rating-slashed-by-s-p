Fresno,  California , had its bond
rating cut three levels by  Standard & Poor’s , which said the
state’s fifth most-populous city has almost depleted its
reserves amid the economic decline.  The city’s issuer credit rating was lowered to A from AA
and to A- from AA- on its lease-revenue bonds, S&P said in
statement. The city has $365 million of lease-revenue bonds and
$174 million of pension bonds outstanding. The outlook is
negative, meaning a further downgrade is possible.  The city’s depleted  general-fund  reserves leave it
vulnerable if  tax revenue  comes in less than projected,
according to the rating company. Fixing the city’s fiscal
troubles will require political and collective-bargaining
cooperation that may not be achievable in the short term, S&P
said.  “Although the city reported that the fiscal 2012 general-
fund budget is balanced, persistent structural imbalance has
resulted in the city’s significantly weakened financial
position, as well as the near-depletion of the city’s emergency
reserve, which it used to balance the general-fund budget in
prior years and to support deficit spending outside of the
general fund,” S&P credit analyst Misty Newland said in the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
