The  Federal Reserve  bought $2.5
billion of Treasuries maturing between 2036 and 2041 as part of
its program to replace $400 billion of short-term debt in its
portfolio with longer-term Treasuries in an effort to reduce
borrowing costs.  Fourteen of the 15 securities listed for possible purchase
were acquired, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of New York
