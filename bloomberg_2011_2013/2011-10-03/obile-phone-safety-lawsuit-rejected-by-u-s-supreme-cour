The U.S.  Supreme Court  refused to
revive a suit against wireless-phone manufacturers and retailers
filed by customers who said the devices may cause illnesses,
including brain cancer.  The justices today left intact a federal appeals court
decision that said regulations issued by the Federal
Communications Commission preclude suits under state laws by
phone consumers. Most lower courts to consider the issue have
reached similar conclusions.  The suit before the justices, filed in Pennsylvania state
court, named more than a dozen companies and trade associations
as defendants. Those sued included Nokia Inc.; units of  AT&T
Inc. (T)  and Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc.; and Verizon Wireless,
a joint venture between  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  and  Vodafone
Group Plc. (VOD)   Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice  Stephen Breyer  didn’t take part in today’s decision not to hear the
appeal. Both owned shares of Nokia as of Dec. 31, according
their most recent financial-disclosure report.  The appeal centered on the legal impact of the FCC
standards that govern radio frequency emissions and require pre-
authorization of phones sold or leased in the country. The
Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said those
rules, first adopted in 1996, preempt any additional
requirements under state law, including those imposed through
lawsuits.  The Obama administration joined the mobile-phone industry
in urging the Supreme Court to reject the appeal without a
hearing.  The case is Farina v. Nokia, 10-1064.  To contact the reporter on this story:
