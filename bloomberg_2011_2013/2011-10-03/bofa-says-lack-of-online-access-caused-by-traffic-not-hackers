Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  said online
access to accounts was slowed or halted temporarily for a second
consecutive weekday because of heavy customer traffic at the
biggest U.S. lender.  “We do take proactive steps to manage customer traffic
during peak hours,” Tara Burke, a spokeswoman for  Charlotte ,
North Carolina-based Bank of America, said today in a telephone
interview. “Because of that, you are seeing some customers
having slowness or  access  issues. It’s not malware, it’s not
hacking, there is no compromise to customer information. I know
there’s people out there saying that. It’s not true.”  Bank of America has 29 million web accounts and 6.5 million
mobile-banking users, ranking it first among U.S. lenders, the
company said at a March 8 conference. Online and mobile phone
services are increasingly important to the company as more
people rely on the Internet and smartphones to access checking
accounts.  Heavy customer traffic was the same reason that some
customers couldn’t access their online accounts on Sept. 30,
Burke said. The lender’s website also had service disruptions in
March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
