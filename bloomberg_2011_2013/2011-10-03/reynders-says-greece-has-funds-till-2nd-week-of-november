Belgian Finance Minister  Didier
Reynders  said  Greece  has funds to last until the second week of
November, so euro-area leaders can wait to make a decision on
further aid until the so-called troika mission completes its
assessment.  “There’s no need for a Greek decision right now,”
Reynders
told journalists in Luxembourg. Greece “asked for a payment by
the second week of November. They have enough funds to continue
until then.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
