Tanzania’s shilling pared its decline
after the nation’s central bank sold dollars.  The currency of  East Africa ’s second-biggest economy
weakened as much as 0.2 percent to 1,663.25 per dollar and
traded 0.1 percent down at 1,661.5 by 1 p.m. in Dar es Salaam,
the commercial capital. The currency depreciated 2.7 percent in
the third quarter, extending its drop this year to 11 percent.  “The central bank came through and sold some dollars this
morning,” Zainul Chandoo, head treasurer at Stanbic Bank
Tanzania Ltd., Standard Bank Group Ltd.’s local unit, said by
phone from Dar es Salaam.  Joseph Massawe, director of economic research and policy at
Bank of Tanzania, said he could not comment immediately, when
contacted by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
