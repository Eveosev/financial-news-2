Royal KPN NV Chief Executive Officer
Eelco Blok said the largest Dutch phone company may consider an
acquisition in  Germany  because it’s interested in taking part in
consolidation in that market.  “If something is available and the price is right we will
look at it,” Blok said at a conference in Brussels today,
adding that there’s nothing for sale at the moment. He said KPN
won’t sell its German E-Plus division.  The E-Plus wireless unit added 558,000 customers in Germany
in the second quarter for a total of 21.5 million, KPN said July
26. The unit’s market share by service revenue climbed to 15.8
percent in the quarter from 15.7 percent a year earlier.  “Germany is a very important market for KPN and we see
opportunities to grow further,” Blok said on a conference call
in July.  While the legal process continues for AT&T to purchase
Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA unit, there is an opportunity
for consolidation in the German wireless market,  Robin Bienenstock , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said in a note
to investors last week. There is “material risk” KPN will be
left out of potential consolidation, and will become a distant
third in the German market, Bienenstock said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
