Wockhardt Ltd. (WPL)  fell to its lowest
level in more than 10 weeks after a newspaper reported the U.S.
 Food and Drug Administration  has sought clarifications regarding
its injectables factory in western India.  The  shares  declined 2.3 percent to 1,712.70 rupees at the
close in Mumbai, the lowest level since Jan. 30. The S&P BSE
Sensex rose 0.6 percent.  The U.S. FDA contacted Wockhardt about its factory in
Aurangabad, in the western state of Maharashtra, after
dispatching a team to inspect it last month, the DNA reported on
April 13 without saying where it got the information. Wockhardt
spokesman Daryl Suchitha didn’t immediately respond to a call
made to his office and an e-mail seeking comment.  “There may be concern among investors that this issue
could spread to some of the company’s other factories,” said
Hitesh Mahida, an analyst at Fortune Equity Brokers ( India ) Ltd.
“And the other question is how long it will take to resolve --
the FDA has become very strict with respect to manufacturing
injectables.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
