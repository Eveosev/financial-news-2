South African corn futures declined
the most in more than a week as prices for the grain decreased
in the U.S., the world’s largest producer, on concern demand
from  China  will weaken.  White corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
slumped 2.2 percent to 2,132 rand ($236) a metric ton, the most
since April 5, by the close on the South African Futures
Exchange in Johannesburg. The yellow variety fell 2.1 percent to
2,102 rand a ton.  Corn dropped 1.6 percent to $6.3125 a bushel on the Chicago
Board of Trade on concern that Chinese demand will weaken amid
slower-than-estimated economic growth and an outbreak of avian
influenza in the country.  “The American price went down during the trading session,
Thys Grobbelaar, an analyst at Klerksdorp, South Africa-based
Senwes Ltd., said by phone today.  South Africa is the continent’s largest producer of corn.
White corn is a staple food, while the yellow variety is mainly
used as animal feed.  Wheat for May delivery gained 0.8 percent to 3,403 rand a
ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
