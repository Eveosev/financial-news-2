Ford Motor Co. (F)  said it can capture
6 percent of the Chinese automotive market by 2015, David Schoch, president of the company’s Asia Pacific region, told
reporters in Shanghai.  “I think we can get to that,” Schoch said. “This can be
a turbocharged year for us to really kick us into high gear.”  Ford, the second-largest U.S. automaker, is spending $4.9
billion to expand its lineup and double production capacity in
China, the world’s largest automotive market. The company, based
in Dearborn, Michigan, is trying to catch up in China, after
getting a later start there than Volkswagen AG and  General
Motors Co. (GM)   Schoch said Ford expects auto sales to expand to 30 million
to 32 million annually by 2020. Ford projects there will be more
than 1 billion people in  China  by that year who will be able to
afford a car.  To contact the reporter on this story:
