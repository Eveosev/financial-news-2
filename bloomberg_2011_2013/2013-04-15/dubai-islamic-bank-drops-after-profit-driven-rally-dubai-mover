Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB)  dropped the
most in a month on bets a rally in the lender’s shares in April,
spurred by profit expectations, was overdone.  Shares of the United Arab Emirates’ biggest Shariah-
compliant bank declined 3.9 percent, set for the largest
decrease since March 13, to 2.47 dirhams at 12:38 p.m. in Dubai.
The stock had rallied 27 percent this month through yesterday,
before Dubai Islamic reported after markets closed that  first-
quarter profit  jumped 17 percent, beating analysts’ estimates.
The benchmark  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  fell 0.6 percent.  “DIB has had an excellent run and was overcooked,”  Julian Bruce , Dubai-based head of institutional trading at EFG-Hermes
Holding SAE, said by e-mail today. “Broader market weakness is
encouraging investors to take profits irrespective of results.”  European (SXXP)  and  Asian (MXAP)  stocks retreated after Chinese economic
growth and industrial production expanded less than economists’
estimates. All Gulf Cooperation Council bourses declined today
apart from Oman’s, with the  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  of the
region’s most-traded stocks losing 0.3 percent.  Dubai Islamic’s profit climbed to 301.7 million dirhams
($82 million), compared with a 292 million-dirham median
 estimate  of three analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Three analysts
have a  buy rating  on the shares, two say hold and one recommends
selling, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
