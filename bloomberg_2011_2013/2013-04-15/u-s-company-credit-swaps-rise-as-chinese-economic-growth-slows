A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk increased after  China’s economy  lost momentum in the first
quarter.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, added 0.6
basis point to a mid-price of 82.6 basis points at 8:12 a.m. in
New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  China ’s gross domestic product rose 7.7 percent from a year
earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said in Beijing
today. That compared with the 8 percent median  forecast  in a
Bloomberg survey of economists and 7.9 percent growth in the
fourth quarter. Concern that the global recovery is waning may
stoke investor worries that companies will have difficulty
repaying obligations.  The credit-swaps index typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
