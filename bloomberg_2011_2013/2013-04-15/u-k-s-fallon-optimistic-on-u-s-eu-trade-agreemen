U.K. Business and Energy Minister
Michael Fallon said he’s optimistic the U.S. will agree a free-
trade deal with the European Union, adding that  Barack Obama 
appears more positive about the idea than predecessors.  “These things have been talked about for years,” Fallon
said in a telephone interview as he prepared to set off on a
visit to the U.S. “I’m more optimistic now. There’s a lot of
momentum behind this one. The will towards a deal exists in the
Obama administration in a way it didn’t in previous
administrations.”  Obama promised in February to pursue a trade agreement with
the 27-nation EU. Talks are due to start in the middle of this
year. The two sides have been at odds over issues such as
regulatory standards, farm subsidies and health protections.  Fallon said that while it’s difficult for governments to
lower non-tariff barriers during a downturn, the economic
slowdown also makes the case for a deal to boost growth and
jobs.  The minister will visit  Detroit , where he’ll urge
automakers to invest in the U.K., and  Boston , where he’ll look
at new energy initiatives and study whether there are lessons
for the U.K. in encouraging startup companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
