(Corrects analystsâ€™ estimate in story published April 15.)  HCA Holdings Inc. (HCA) , the largest for-
profit U.S. hospital chain, declined in extended trading after
releasing preliminary first-quarter earnings data that showed
slower admissions growth than a year earlier.  Revenue for the first quarter is expected to be $8.44
billion, almost unchanged from the period a year earlier, the
Nashville, Tennessee-based company said today in a statement.
Analysts had anticipated sales of $8.65 billion, according to
the average of 16  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Results were
affected by a slowdown in the rate of growth in admissions and a
weakness in outpatient volumes, the hospital operator said.  Volume weakness also was reported April 10 by  Health
Management Associates Inc. (HMA) , which reduced the high end of its
2013 earnings forecast. HCA, which oversees 162 hospitals and
112 freestanding outpatient surgery centers, today reaffirmed
its annual earnings forecast of $3 a share to $3.30 a share
excluding certain items.  The hospital company said same facility admissions
increased 0.1 percent for the quarter, compared with 3.2 percent
a year ago, while same facility equivalent admissions declined
0.7 percent compared with a 4.8 percent increase a year earlier.  HCA shares declined 4.7 percent to $35 at 5:24 p.m.  New
York  time after closing down 4.2 percent to $36.72.  To contact the reporter on this story:
