Volkswagen AG (VOW) ,  Europe ’s largest
carmaker, named Juergen Stackmann to replace James Muir as head
of the loss-making Spanish Seat unit.  The 51-year-old executive, who joined VW in 2010 from  Ford
Motor Co. (F) , will take over at the Martorell-based brand on May 1,
VW said in a statement today. Stackmann joined VW as the sales
chief for the Czech Skoda brand, before later taking over
marketing responsibilities at the VW Group and VW brand.  Muir will “assume a senior management function within the
Volkswagen Group and will report directly to the board of
management,” the Wolfsburg, Germany-based company said. VW
spokesman Markus Schlesag declined to comment on Muir’s next
job.  Seat is the only loss-making unit at VW, whose operating
profit rose 1.8 percent to 11.5 billion euros (15 billion) in
2012. Seat’s loss narrowed 31 percent last year to 156 million
euros. Industrywide deliveries in  Spain  are down 9.7 percent
through February as high unemployment depresses demand.  Auto executives are forecasting a sixth straight year of
declining demand in Europe in 2013.  Muir moved to Seat in 2009 from the European division of
Japanese carmaker  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261)  and “has been instrumental
in successfully restructuring the company,” VW said today.  Stackmann holds a degree in business administration and
started his career with Ford in 1989, where he held various
positions in Germany and the U.K.  To contact the reporter on this story:
