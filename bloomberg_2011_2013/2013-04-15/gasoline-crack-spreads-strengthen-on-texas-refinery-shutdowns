Gasoline strengthened versus crude
oil as power failures over the weekend in  Port Arthur ,  Texas ,
caused refinery units to shut.  Crack spreads widened as the power loss by Valero Energy
Corp., Motiva Enterprises LLC and Total Petrochemicals USA Inc.
affected 1.08 million barrels a day of refining capacity. The
May  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate crude widened
$1.17 to $27.56 a barrel. The  spread  against Brent oil on ICE
Futures Europe Exchange rose $1.10 to $15.67.  “Products saw some support as a result of refinery outages
affecting refinery operations in the Port Arthur area this past
weekend,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates
LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for May delivery fell 2.99 cents, or 1.1 percent,
to $2.77719 a gallon at 10:03 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  on volume that was 53 percent above the 100-day
average.  Prices touched $2.7456, the lowest intraday level since
Jan. 17, as part of a broad commodity selloff after a report
that  China ’s economic growth lost momentum in the first quarter.
Crude on the Nymex slid below $90 a barrel and Brent on the
London ICE Futures Exchange touched a nine-month low.  “Slowing growth in China has affected a number of
commodities,” Lipow said.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, fell 0.6 cent to
$3.526 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. Prices have
fallen 26 cents from the year-to-date high of $3.786 on Feb. 26
and are 38.1 cents below a year ago.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for May delivery declined 3.67
cents, or 1.3 percent, to $2.8351 a gallon on volume that was 23
percent above the 100-day average. Prices touched $2.832, the
lowest intraday level since Aug. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
