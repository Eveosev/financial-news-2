Wholesale electricity from  New
Jersey  to North Carolina gained on lingering heating demand and
the biggest drop in Northeast nuclear generation since October.  Spot power rose for the first time in three days as  Public
Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG)  shut a nuclear plant in New
Jersey.  Electricity usage in the mid-Atlantic states has been
about 3 percent to 5 percent above yesterday’s forecast since 7
a.m., according PJM Interconnection LLC, which manages the
largest  electricity market  in the country.  PJM’s benchmark Western Hub, which includes prices from
Pennsylvania to  Washington , rose 24.15 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$42.72 a megawatt-hour at 1:15 p.m. from the April 12 on-peak
average, according to the grid operator. On-peak hours run from
7 a.m. to 11 p.m.  “Today there is stronger-than-expected heating demand in
the market,” said  Stephen Schork , president of Schork Group
Inc., a consulting group in Villanova, Pennsylvania. “You have
that in combination with higher input costs and lower baseload
nuclear.”  Power consumption in the mid-Atlantic region climbed to
30,669 megawatts at 9:15 a.m., about 5 percent higher than the
forecast for that time, PJM data show. The grid operator raised
its peak-demand forecast by 3.2 percent to 31,981 megawatts for
8:30 p.m. today from yesterday’s outlook of 30,335 megawatts.  Northeast nuclear generation dropped by 2,359 megawatts, or
11 percent, to 18,930 megawatts from yesterday after three
reactors in New Jersey,  Massachusetts  and Upstate New York were
shut, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission data compiled by
Bloomberg showed. Output was at 76 percent of capacity, the
least since Nov. 19 and 7.9 percent lower from a year ago.  Public Service Enterprise Group shut the 1,174-megawatt
Salem 1 reactor, the third-largest in the Northeast, after it
was operating at full power yesterday. The plant about 18 miles
(29 kilometers) south of Wilmington, Delaware, is undergoing
refueling and maintenance that will include replacing valves,
relays, actuators and seals, according to Joe Delmar, a company
spokesman based in Newark, New Jersey.  Plants fueled by natural gas are making up for the loss of
generation from these nuclear plants, which is supporting both
spot gas and power prices, Schork said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
