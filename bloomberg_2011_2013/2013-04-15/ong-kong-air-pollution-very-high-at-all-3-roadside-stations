Hong Kong ’s Air Pollution Index was
“very high” at all three of the city’s roadside-monitoring
stations, according to data from the Environmental Protection
Department’s website.  The index was 191 in the Central business district and 115
in  Causeway Bay  as of 6 a.m. local time. The reading in Mong Kok
was 167. A reading of more than 100 triggers a government
warning for people with heart or respiratory illnesses to avoid
prolonged stays in heavy-traffic areas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
