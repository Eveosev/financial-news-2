German bonds were little changed
before  France  and the Netherlands auction bills.  Benchmark  bund yields  were about six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, from the lowest level in more than eight
months. France is scheduled to sell as much as 7.7 billion euros
($10 billion) of bills maturing between 91 and 350 days today,
while the Netherlands is due to auction 197-day securities.  German 10-year bunds yielded 1.26 percent at 7:10 a.m.
London time. The rate dropped to 1.20 percent on April 5, the
least since July 24. The price of the 1.5 percent security
maturing February 2023 was at 102.20.  German bonds returned 0.5 percent this year through April
12, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
