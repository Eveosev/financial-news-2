Planned maintenance of a domestic-
coal railroad in  China  will likely boost demand and freight
rates for ships delivering imported cargoes, according to Pareto
Securities AS, an Oslo-based investment bank.  The Daqin Railway, which has shipping capacity of 290,000
metric tons a day, will undergo 25 days of maintenance until May
7, according to the China Coal Transport and Distribution
Association. The commodity is mostly shipped on Capesize vessels
carrying more than 150,000 metric tons of cargo each and
Panamaxes about half the size.  “Capesizes and Panamaxes are likely to find some support
in the near term,” Pareto analysts Jonas Advocaat Kraft and
Eirik Haavaldsen said in an e-mailed note today. Still, the
freight market is “soft” and the effect of the additional
demand will be “relatively modest,” they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
