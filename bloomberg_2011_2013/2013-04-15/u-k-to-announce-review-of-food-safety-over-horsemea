U.K. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson will order a review of  food safety  following the
horsemeat scandal, one of his deputies said.  In  written statement to Parliament  in London today,
Agriculture and Food Minister David Heath said Paterson would
“announce a strategic review of the incident and its
implications for the food chain.”  The investigation will be “wide-ranging, to restore and
maintain  consumer confidence  in the food chain and the
responsibilities of food business and practice through the wider
food chain, including: audit, testing, food authenticity, food
safety and health issues,” Heath said.  European authorities are continuing to investigate concerns
that foods advertised as containing beef contained undeclared
horsemeat. Last week, the Dutch government announced a recall of
50,000 metric tons of beef. Tesco Plc, the U.K.’s largest
supermarket operator, said in February it’s examining “all
aspects” of its supply chain after horse was discovered in some
products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
