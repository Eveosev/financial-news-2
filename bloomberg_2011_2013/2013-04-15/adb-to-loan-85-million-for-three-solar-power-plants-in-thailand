The  Asian Development Bank  will
lend $85 million to Solarco, a unit of Thailandâ€™s second-biggest
private power producer, for three solar plants.  The 57 megawatts of projects will be developed at three
main sites in Nakhonpathom and Suphanburi provinces in central
Thailand, ADB said in an April 12  statement  on its website.  A $52 million loan has been approved for Solarco, a unit of
 Electricity Generating (EGCO)  Public Co. An additional $33 million will
be given to Solarco through the ADB Clean Technology Fund.  Electricity Generating plans to raise its installed
capacity of renewable energy to more than 300 megawatts by 2015
from 9.9 megawatts of biomass and 64 megawatts of solar capacity
currently, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
