Returns for Capesize vessels that
haul iron ore slumped amid speculation that slower economic
growth in  China , the world’s biggest buyer of the mineral, will
curb freight rates.  Daily rates for the ships that transport at least 150,000
metric tons of ore cargoes slid 1.9 percent to $4,610, the
biggest drop since April 3, according to data from the London-
based Baltic Exchange today.  Demand to hire vessels hauling dry bulk cargoes including
grains and iron ore was “quiet,” according to an e-mailed
report from U.S. investment bank Dahlman Rose & Co. today.
China’s gross domestic product for the three months to March
rose 7.7 percent from a year earlier, the National Bureau of
Statistics said in Beijing today. That compares with 7.9 percent
in the fourth quarter, the data showed.  “The negative GDP headline out of China today should put
additional headwinds on any improvement in rates,” Sam
Margolin, an analyst at Cowen Securities LLC, a New York-based
investment bank, said in a report today. Chinese industrial
production growth of 9.5 percent for the first quarter compared
with the previous period’s 10 percent, according to data from
the bureau.  Prices for ore delivered to the Chinese port of Tianjin
slipped 0.1 percent to $140.90 a metric ton today, according to
the Steel Index Ltd.  The Dry Bulk Index gained 0.1 percent to 876 points,
staying at the highest since April 3, exchange data showed.  Daily returns for Panamaxes, the biggest ships that can
navigate the Panama Canal, added 1.1 percent to $8,991 a day,
according to the exchange today. Supramax rates increased 0.1
percent to $9,432. Handysizes, the smallest ships in the gauge,
gained 0.4 percent to $7,856, the highest price since April 3,
exchange data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
