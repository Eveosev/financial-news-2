Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , the second-
largest wireless carrier, said it will cut 500 jobs in Germany.  The company will transfer parts of its main regional
operation to Romania and information-technology operations to
India, Jens Schulte-Bockum, CEO of Vodafone’s German unit, said
in an internal letter.  Schulte-Bockum didn’t say in the letter how many jobs will
be added in Romania and India. Vodafone in February reached an
agreement to cut 620 jobs in Spain.  “Commercial pressure is increasing,” and regulation of
the industry “has been hostile to investment for years,”
Schulte-Bockum said in the letter.  Vodafone will also reduce entry-level salaries and
establish a service unit for customer care, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
