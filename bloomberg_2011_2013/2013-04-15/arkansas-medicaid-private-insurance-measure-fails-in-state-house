An Arkansas proposal to use
Medicaid money to buy private insurance for low-income residents
failed in the state House.  Sixty-nine lawmakers voted for the legislation today, while
28 were opposed, short of the 75 votes needed for approval, said
Cecillea Pond-Mayo, a spokeswoman for the Arkansas House of
Representatives. House Speaker Davy Carter, a Republican, plans
to call another vote on the measure tomorrow, she said.  Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe, a Democrat, received informal
approval on Feb. 18 from the federal government to use money for
Medicaid expansion under President  Barack Obama ’s health-care
overhaul to instead buy private coverage.  “It’s a very tough vote because a lot of Republicans have
been running for years against Obamacare,” said Dan Greenberg,
president of the Advance Arkansas Institute, a Little Rock-based
research group that favors limited government and opposed the
Arkansas legislation. “If the House turns it down, it is
dead.”  Republican lawmakers in states including Florida and
 Tennessee  have expressed interest in the plan, pending the
Arkansas vote, Matt Salo, executive director of the National
Association of Medicaid Directors in  Washington , said March 30.  The Arkansas Hospital Association favors the measure
because it would provide more insurance coverage for the poor,
said Paul Cunningham, executive vice president of the Little
Rock-based hospital trade group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
