Japanese and Australian  stock
futures  fell as the yen maintained gains amid concern the pace
of economic growth in China is slowing and as bomb blasts in
Boston spurred appetite for haven assets.  American Depositary Receipts  of  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , the world’s
second-biggest construction equipment maker, lost 3.2 percent.
ADRs of  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that gets 80 percent of sales
outside Japan, declined 2.4 percent as the yen strengthened from
the close of Japan’s equity markets yesterday. ADRs of  BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest mining company, slid 3
percent.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
June traded at 13,045 in Chicago yesterday, down from 13,200 at
the close in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
13,080 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index retreated 1.3 percent and New Zealand’s NZX 50
Index fell 1.1 percent.  “Brace yourselves today,” said Evan Lucas, a market
strategist at IG Markets Ltd., a provider of trading services in
Melbourne. “The sell-off will be sharp and indiscriminate, loss
will be across the board, not even the defensives will escape
the flight to safety today.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the benchmark regional
equities gauge, yesterday traded at 13.9 times average estimated
earnings compared with 14 for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) 
and 12.5 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Chinese GDP  The Asian gauge retreated yesterday from the highest level
in 20 months after reports showed Chinese economic growth and
industrial production expanded less than economists’ estimated.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.2
percent. The gauge dropped 2.3 percent yesterday, the biggest
decline since November, after the China gross domestic product
report. U.S. stocks extended losses as explosions rocked the
finish line area of the Boston Marathon. Almost all of the drop
came before the incident. Explosions killed two people and
injured 23 near the finish of the Boston Marathon, police said.  Market declines “were compounded further by the dreadful
events in Boston,” said IG’s Evans.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. dropped 3.3 percent in New York
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
