Brent crude  fell below $100 a
barrel for the first time since July amid signs global economic
growth may slow, curbing fuel demand. West Texas Intermediate
declined to a four-month low on speculation U.S. supplies rose.  Brent slid as much as 2.6 percent to $98 a barrel, while
WTI dropped to the lowest intraday price since Dec. 14. German
investor confidence declined more than economists forecast in
April. U.S. crude stockpiles probably climbed  1.5 million
barrels  last week to 390.4 million, the highest since July 1990,
according to a Bloomberg survey before data tomorrow.  Iran  was
hit by a 7.8-magnitude earthquake centered in the eastern region
near the border with  Pakistan  and felt as far away as  Abu Dhabi .  “As with many times in the past, oil has been used as the
tool to express concerns about the macro economy and we are in
the same situation now,” said Amrita Sen, chief oil market
analyst at Energy Aspects Ltd., a research company in London,
who predicted on April 8 that Brent may soon drop to $100.
“Brent has been under pressure due to an improvement in
supplies and a lack of demand.”  Brent for June settlement fell as much as $2.63 on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, and recovered to
$99.80 as of 1:25 p.m. local time. The volume of all futures
traded was 70 percent higher than the 100-day average for the
time of day. Prices are down 10 percent this year after four
annual gains. The front-month European benchmark grade was at a
premium of $11.01 to WTI.  Iran Earthquake  WTI for May delivery slipped as much as $2.65 to $86.06 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange. Prices are down a fourth day, the longest run of
declines this year. The volume of all futures traded was more
than twice the 100-day average. The contract fell $2.58 to
$88.71 yesterday, the lowest close since Dec. 24.  The measurement of the earthquake in Iran was reported by
the  U.S. Geological Survey , which said it struck at about 3:14
p.m. local time. Iran’s state television said its epicenter was
in the eastern province of Sistan and Baluchistan. There were no
immediate reports about casualties.  The basket of 12 crude grades used as a reference by the
 Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  also fell below
$100 for the first time since July. The basket was at $98.56
yesterday, according to an e-mail today from the group’s Vienna-
based secretariat. It’s the first time the average has slipped
below $100 since July 16.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
said its  index of investor and analyst expectations , which aims
to predict economic developments six months in advance, fell to
36.3 from a three-year high of 48.5 in March. Economists
forecast a drop to 41, according to the median of 40 estimates
in a Bloomberg News survey.  Gasoline Stockpiles  U.S. gasoline stockpiles probably fell by  800,000 barrels ,
according to the median estimate of seven analysts in the
Bloomberg survey before tomorrow’s report from the Energy
Information Administration. Distillate supplies, a category that
includes heating oil and diesel, probably declined 500,000
barrels, the survey shows.  The industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute  will
release separate inventory figures today. The API collects
stockpile information on a voluntary basis from operators of
refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The government
requires that reports be filed with the EIA, the Energy
Department’s statistics unit, for its weekly survey.  Brent’s decline may stall as technical indicators show
prices may be falling too quickly for further losses to be
sustainable. On the weekly chart, the relative strength index is
approaching 30, a reading that would signal futures are
oversold. Brent rebounded from below $90 a barrel in June 2012
after the RSI dropped to 25.4. It is also reaching long-term
support along the 200-week average, around $97.70. Buy orders
tend to be clustered near chart-support levels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
