 At least 30 investors have
indicated interest in 10 Nigerian  power plants  put up for sale
by the government, an official in charge of the process said.  Africa ’s most populous country is offering as much as 80
percent of its shares in thermal power plants located across the
country, James Olotu, chief executive officer of Niger Delta
Power Holding Co. of  Nigeria , which owns the facilities, said
today in a phone interview from Abuja, the capital. “We have
organizations showing interest from all parts of the world,” he
said without giving further details.  Jointly owned by the federal, state and local governments,
the power companies were set up from 2004 as a special
intervention to boost gas-fueled electricity output. With
combined installed capacity at more than 5,000 megawatts, they
include the 850-megawatt Alaoji Generation Co. near the
southeastern city of Aba, the 754-megawatt Olorunsogo Generation
Co. in the southwest and the 634-megawatt Calabar Generation Co.
on the southeastern coast.  Nigeria sold as much as 60 percent stakes in 10 electricity
distributors and five power generators that were part of the
former state monopoly on Feb. 22 under a plan to increase output
with private investment. Blackouts are a daily occurrence in
Africa’s top oil producer where electricity demand is almost
double the supply of about 5,000 megawatts. Buyers included
 Siemens AG (SIE) ,  Korea Electric Power Corp. (015760)  and Transnational Corp.
of Nigeria Plc, the West African nation’s privatization agency
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
