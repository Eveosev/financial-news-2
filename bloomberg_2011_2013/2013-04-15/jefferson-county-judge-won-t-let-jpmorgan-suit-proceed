Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp.,
the bond insurer, was blocked by a judge from proceeding with a
lawsuit against  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  on grounds that it would
interfere with the reorganization of Jefferson County, Alabama,
the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Thomas B. Bennett in Birmingham,
Alamaba, found that the case Assured has against JPMorgan in  New
York  state court involves the same facts, circumstances and
lawyers as a similar case in which Syncora Guarantee Inc. sued
Jefferson County. Because Assured hadn’t named the county in its
case, the insurer argued that its lawsuit should proceed.  “The degree of sameness between the Assured action and the
Syncora action requires equality of treatment,” Bennett ruled.  In 2011, Jefferson County filed for  bankruptcy protection 
from its creditors, blaming the loss of a business-related tax
and more than $3 billion in warrants that the sewage system
couldn’t repay.  Once a municipality enters bankruptcy, any lawsuits against
it are temporarily halted.  Syncora and Assured insured some of the sewer warrants.
They argued in their lawsuits that the insurance policies were
only written because the county and JPMorgan, the underwriter
for the warrants, committed fraud.  The case is In re Jefferson County, Alabama, 11-05736,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Northern District of Alabama (Birmingham). The
Assured case is Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp. v. JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A., 650642/2010 New York State Supreme Court
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
