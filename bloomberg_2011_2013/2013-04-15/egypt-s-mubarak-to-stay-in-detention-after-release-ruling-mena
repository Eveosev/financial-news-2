Former Egyptian President  Hosni
Mubarak  will remain behind bars even though he won a ruling
backing his appeal to be released pending trial, the state-run
Middle East News Agency said.  A Cairo court today granted Mubarak’s request to be freed
in a case involving the killing of protesters during the 2011
uprising. Mubarak will remain in detention on three other
charges related to corruption and abuse of state funds, MENA
said, citing Mahmoud El-Hefnawy, spokesman for the country’s
General Prosecution.  The former leader was initially held in a prison hospital,
and transfered to a military hospital amid reports his health
was failing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
