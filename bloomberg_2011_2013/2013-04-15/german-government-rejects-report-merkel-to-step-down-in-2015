The German government said that
 Chancellor Angela Merkel  intended to serve out a full four-year
term if she won federal elections on Sept. 22, rejecting a
newspaper report that she planned to step down early.  Merkel, who took office in November 2005, has told
confidants that 10 years is the maximum a chancellor can
tolerate,  Germany ’s biggest-selling Bild newspaper reported
today, citing extracts from a Merkel biography by its chief
political columnist, Nikolaus Blome. It didn’t give a source for
the story.  As a minister, Merkel urged former Chancellor Helmut Kohl
to prepare a successor and regarded his failed bid to win a
record sixth term in 1998 as a mistake, Bild said. She is also
tempted by the prospect of becoming the first chancellor of the
post-World War II period to leave without being voted out of
office or being deserted by her own party, it reported.  “Naturally, the chancellor will run for a full term of
office in the parliamentary election in September,” Steffen Seibert, Merkel’s chief spokesman, told reporters at a regular
government press conference in Berlin today.  Support for Merkel’s coalition parties rose to a combined
47 percent in a weekly Forsa poll published April 10, the
highest level since January 2010, giving her a clear majority
for the first time in more than three years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
