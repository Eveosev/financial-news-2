Nigeria’s naira depreciated for a
third day, heading for the lowest in two weeks as oil, the
nation’s key export, retreated and prompted a slide in the
external reserves of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer.  The currency of sub-Saharan Africa’s second-biggest economy
slid 0.1 percent to 158.10 per dollar by 11:31 a.m. in Lagos,
Nigeria’s commercial capital, poised for its weakest since April
2, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bonny Light Crude, the nation’s main export grade, slid for
a fourth day, dropping 1.7 percent to $104.01 in New York, a 14
percent decline from this year’s high of $120.54 in February.
Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate also eased as first
quarter economic growth unexpectedly eased in  China , the world’s
second-largest crude consumer.  Nigeria’s  foreign-currency reserves  declined for three days
last week before reaching $48.705 billion on April 11, according
to data on the Central Bank of Nigeria website.  “We expect to see build-up of pressure on the naira on the
back of recent decrease in external reserves,” analysts at
Lagos-based Cowry Asset Management Ltd., led by Edgar Ebinum,
wrote in an e-mailed note to clients today.  Borrowing costs on the nation’s local-currency debt due
January 2022 fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to
11.02 percent, according to April 12 prices on the Lagos-based
 Financial Markets Dealers Association  website.  Yields on Nigeria’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January
2021 declined 2 basis points to 3.972 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi weakened less than 0.1 percent to 1.9445 per
dollar in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
