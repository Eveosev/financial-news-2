Israeli stocks in New York fell the
most since February, led by  MagicJack VocalTec Ltd. (CALL)  and
Caesarstone Sdot Yam Ltd., as slowing growth in China curbed the
outlook for exports and technology spending.  The  Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index (ISRA25BN)  of the largest Israeli
stocks in the U.S. slid 1.1 percent with trading in  Tel Aviv 
closed until April 17 for holidays. MagicJack, which sells
voice-over-Internet technology, sank 4.8 percent, while
chipmaker  EZchip Semiconductor Ltd. (EZCH)  dropped 1.9 percent.
Caesarstone slumped 4.2 percent after one of its biggest
investors said that it had sold 91 percent of its holding.  China’s economy , the world’s second largest, grew 7.7
percent last quarter, slowing from 7.9 percent in the last three
months of 2012. Israel’s government said in 2011 that it would
spend 100 million shekels ($27.5 million) boosting exports to
Asia as the  European debt crisis  damps demand from the euro
region. Israel has 54 companies traded on the Nasdaq Stock
Market, the most of any country beside the U.S. after China.  “When the Chinese economy slows, it’s a sign of a
problematic growth environment,” Jacob de Tusch-Lec, a London-
based money manager at Artemis Investment Management LLP, which
oversees $20 billion in assets including Israeli shares, said by
phone yesterday. “That’s not an environment to buy Israeli tech
stocks that need capital to grow.”  Israel’s trade deficit, excluding diamonds, is 5.8 billion
shekels with 20 percent of exports to Asian countries in
February, according to a March 18  report  by the Central Bureau
of Statistics. Exports to the European Union and U.S. were 38
percent and 22 percent respectively.  Trailing Nasdaq  The  Bloomberg Israel-US gauge  has gained 3.5 percent this
year, trailing a 6.5 percent jump in the  Nasdaq Composite Index (CCMP) 
and the TA-25 Index’s 3.8 percent increase.  Ten of the 11 technology companies on the Israel-US measure
derived at least 2.1 percent of their revenue from the Asia-
Pacific region in 2011, according to data from company filings
compiled by Bloomberg. The group had the biggest contribution to
 losses  in the index yesterday.  Orbotech Ltd., which makes gear used to test televisions
and smartphones, got 82 percent of revenue from the  Asia-Pacific (ORBK) 
in 2011, the most among the companies on the Israel-US index.  The Yavne, Israel-based company will report  sales  of $90.4
million in the first quarter, according to the mean of four
analysts estimates collated by Bloomberg, the least since the
three months ended Sept. 30, 2007. Orbotech dropped 3 percent to
$9.76 in New York yesterday, the biggest drop since April 1.  Radware Falls  Radware Ltd. (RDWR)  slipped 1.7 percent to $14.40, extending its
monthly loss to 24 percent. The Tel Aviv-based maker of
technology that helps networks run efficiently posted first-
quarter profit that trailed forecasts as sales in China and the
European, Middle East and Africa region slowed, according to an
April 5 statement.  MagicJack, based in Netanya, Israel, fell 4.8 percent to
$16.42 in U.S. trading, the biggest drop since March 18.
 SodaStream International Ltd. (SODA) , the Airport City, Israel-based
maker of home soda machines, sank 3.9 percent to $50.95.  Caesarstone retreated 4.2 percent to $21.80, the lowest
price since Feb. 12. Tene Investment Funds Ltd. sold 91 percent
of its holdings in the maker of quartz-based countertops,
totaling $800 million, according to an e-mailed statement. Tene
was  Caesarstone (CSTE) ’s second-biggest shareholder with 23.1 percent,
as of a Feb. 28 filing, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (CHKP) , the Tel Aviv-based
security networks maker, slipped 1.7 percent to $45.74, the
steepest drop since March 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
