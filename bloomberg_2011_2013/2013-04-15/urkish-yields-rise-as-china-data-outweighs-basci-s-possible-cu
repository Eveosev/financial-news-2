Turkish  bond yields  climbed as
slowing economic growth in  China  weakened risk appetite for
emerging market assets, outweighing a possible  interest-rate  cut
by the Turkish central bank tomorrow.  The yield on two-year benchmark bonds rose two basis points
to 5.75 percent at the 5 p.m. close in Istanbul, paring this
month’s decline to 60 basis points. The lira weakened less than
0.1 percent to 1.7886 per dollar, trimming this month’s
appreciation to 1.2 percent.  The majority of 13 analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg expect
the central bank to reduce the benchmark interest rate and the
overnight lending rate by 25 basis points. While a possible cut
has already been priced in the  bond market , China’s weaker-than-
anticipated economic growth is weighing on investor sentiment,
said Selim Gulkan, a fixed-income trader at  Turk Ekonomi Bankasi
AS (TEBNK)  in Istanbul. China’s gross domestic product grew 7.7 percent
from a year earlier, compared with an 8 percent median forecast
in a Bloomberg News survey.  “Risk-taking appetite has lessened and volumes are not
strong,” Istanbul-based Gulkan said by phone. “It is possible
that people are taking profits.”  Central Bank Governor Erdem Basci said on April 3 that a
“measured rate cut” may be in store depending on  Turkey ’s real
effective exchange rate index. The gauge, which measures the
lira against an inflation-weighted basket of currencies used by
Turkey’s trading partners, rose to 119.95 in March from 119.75
in February, the central bank said April 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
