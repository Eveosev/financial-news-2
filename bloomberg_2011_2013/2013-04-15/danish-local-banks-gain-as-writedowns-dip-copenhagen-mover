Denmark ’s small and medium-sized
banks rose to their highest in Copenhagen trading in more than
two months amid speculation that writedowns will ease.  A Bloomberg index of Denmark’s 23 listed commercial banks
with market capitalization of 1 billion kroner ($175 million) or
less rose 1.4 percent to its highest since Feb. 4. Skjern Bank
A/S, which today repaid the last of its government-backed debt,
rose as much as 12 percent.  Smaller lenders’ writedowns of business loans fell in the
first quarter and were unchanged for personal loans, according
to the most recent central bank data. Last year, impairments
climbed as lenders implemented new, tougher regulations by the
Financial Supervisory Authority.  “It could point to a slightly improved situation for the
smaller banks,” Mads Thinggaard, a bank analyst at Nykredit
A/S, said. “Perhaps the market figures the implementation of
the new writedown rules is over, and since the banks are still
up and running, it may see some kind of upside.”  Skjern Bank (SKJE) , based in the Danish town of the same name,
gained as much as 2.9 kroner to 28 kroner, its highest level
since Dec. 21, after saying it had repaid the last 98 million
kroner of 152 million kroner it held in state-backed debt. The
share rose 1.56% to 25.50 kroner at 1:21 p.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
