Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  rose after BTIG
Research initiated coverage of the video-streaming service with
a buy rating and a $250 price target, saying subscriber growth
and profitability will exceed expectations in the coming years.  Netflix, based in Los Gatos, California,  climbed  1.9
percent to $176.50 at the close in New York. The shares advanced
91 percent this year, compared with an 8.8 percent increase for
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  The company will benefit from improving bandwidth for
streaming movies and television shows, slow-moving competition
and increasing content leverage,  Richard Greenfield , an analyst
with BTIG Research, wrote today in a note.  “Netflix is set to benefit from the perfect storm of
catalysts,” Greenfield wrote.  Netflix Chief Executive Officer  Reed Hastings  said
subscribers had watched over 4 billion hours of content since
January, according to an April 11 posting on his Facebook page.
The company is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings on
April 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
