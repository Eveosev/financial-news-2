Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  asked two
managing directors on the equity trading desk including Jean El Khoury to leave the Japanese firm today, said a person with
knowledge of the matter.  El Khoury was the head of equities trading for  Asia 
excluding  Japan , while Emmanuel Slezack was head of index flow
derivatives trading for the region, said the person, who asked
not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Both
men were based in Hong Kong.  Nomura is overhauling the team on the trading desk after
hiring Yasuhiro Fujiwara, a former Bank of America Corp.
veteran, as head of equities for Asia ex-Japan, the person said.
Fujiwara has also taken on the role of head of equity
derivatives trading for the Asia-Pacific region, according to a
memo obtained by  Bloomberg News  last month.  Nomura is overhauling the trading desk after hiring

calls to his office in Hong Kong today, and a person who
answered El Khoury’s phone said he no longer works there.
