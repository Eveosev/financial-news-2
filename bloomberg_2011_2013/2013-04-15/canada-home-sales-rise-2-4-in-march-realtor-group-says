 Canadian existing home sales rose
2.4 percent in March from the previous month on gains in
Vancouver and Toronto, a realtor group said.  Sales increased to 36,127 units from 35,297 in February,
the  Canadian Real Estate Association  said in a statement from
Ottawa today. Vancouver sales rose 10.9 percent to 2,059 units,
while sales in Toronto advanced 1.8 percent to 6,988 units.  Canada’s housing market has been supported by some of the
lowest  mortgage rates  on record. Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  last month softened language about the need to raise the
central bank’s 1 percent policy interest rate, partly on
evidence the housing boom is slowing.  Sales dropped 15.3 percent in March from a year earlier,
CREA said. The average price rose 2.5 percent to C$378,532
($371,164) on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, according to the
report.  “Home sales have taken a big step back since last spring
but prices are holding up,” BMO Capital Markets chief economist
 Doug Porter  said in a research note today from Toronto. “The
market remains relatively balanced, albeit with a distinct
fade.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
