The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development may lend as much as 5.3 million
euros ($7 million) to a unit of  ICCO Energ SRL , a Romanian
private company, to help build a photovoltaic power plant.  The EBRD loan will be directed to ICCO Solar Energy SRL,
which plans to build the plant to supply electricity to Raja SA,
a water utility in southeastern Constanta county, the London-
based bank said today on its website.  The EBRD loan is pending final review.  To contact the reporter on this story:
