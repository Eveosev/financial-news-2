European stocks retreated,
following their biggest weekly gain in a month, as  China’s
economy  grew at a slower pace than estimated and a gauge of
manufacturing in the  New York  area missed forecasts.  Randgold Resources Ltd. slumped 8.3 percent as gold headed
for its biggest one-day plunge in 30 years. Publicis Groupe SA
dropped the most in almost 18 months.  Roche Holding AG  added 2.7
percent after saying it will collaborate with Ascletis Inc. to
sell one of its drugs in China.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index declined 0.7 percent to 290.43
at the close in London. The benchmark measure gained 1.8 percent
last week, its biggest rally since March 8. The gauge has still
fallen 1.1 percent so far this month as reports on U.S. jobs and
services missed economists’ estimates.  “The Chinese growth data is bad news, especially after the
weak U.S. jobs data we saw,” said Jacques Porta, who helps
manage about $776 million at Ofi Gestion Privee in Paris.
“There is a worried atmosphere among investors because markets
have already increased a lot. To see them go up again, we’ll
need to see very good economic data and I don’t see that getting
better in the next month.”  In  China ,  gross domestic product  rose 7.7 percent in the
first quarter, the National Bureau of Statistics said in
Beijing. That compared with the 8 percent  median forecast  by
analysts in a Bloomberg News survey and the 7.9 percent pace in
the fourth quarter. The country’s industrial production
increased in March at a slower rate than economists had
estimated, while retail-sales growth matched forecasts.  American Manufacturing  In the U.S., the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s  general
economic index  slowed to 3.1 this month from 9.2 in March.
Economists in a Bloomberg News survey had forecast it would drop
to 7. Readings greater than zero mean that activity increased.  National benchmark indexes fell in all of the 18 western-
 European (SXXP)  markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index lost 0.6 percent,
 France ’s CAC 40 Index slid 0.5 percent, and  Germany ’s DAX Index
lost 0.4 percent.  A  gauge of raw-material companies  in the Stoxx 600 sank to
its lowest level since October 2011 as commodity prices tumbled.
Citigroup Inc. lowered its price forecasts for aluminum, copper
and nickel in a note today, saying it expects weakness from the
first quarter to continue through the year.  Randgold plunged 8.3 percent to 4,545 pence and Fresnillo
Plc, the world’s biggest primary silver producer, sank 15
percent to 1,080 pence. Silver slumped 10 percent in London
trading. BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s largest mining company,
slid 3.6 percent to 1,824.5 pence and Rio Tinto Group, the
second biggest, slipped 3.5 percent to 2,973 pence.  Banks Decline  An  index of banks  on the Stoxx 600 retreated 0.7 percent as
euro-area members disagreed over how to handle failed lenders.
HSBC Holdings Plc, Europe’s largest bank, lost 1 percent to
681.4 pence. Societe Generale SA slipped 1.1 percent to 26.10
euros and Danske Bank A/S lost 1.9 percent to 104.40 kroner.  German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  told the other
16 euro-area states at a meeting in Dublin on April 12-13 that
there isn’t enough of a basis in the existing treaties for
building a common banking authority and a fund for failures.
Other nations, including France, Luxembourg and  Denmark , have
urged swift progress to put in place a resolution system.  Publicis dropped 5.2 percent to 51.56 euros after the
world’s third-biggest advertising company called 2013 a
difficult year and said first-quarter sales rose 1.3 percent to
1.56 billion euros ($2 billion). The revenue growth missed
consensus estimates, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and CA Cheuvreux
said in notes to investors.  Accor, Siemens  Accor SA (AC)  declined 4.2 percent to 25.62 euros after Credit
Suisse Group AG downgraded Europe’s largest hotel operator to
underperform, the equivalent of sell, from outperform, citing
the increasing risk of disappointing first-quarter earnings.  Siemens AG retreated 1.8 percent to 79.38 euros after
 Rheinische Post  reported on April 13 that underperforming rail
technology and offshore wind projects will hurt the company’s
quarterly earnings. The newspaper cited an interview with Chief
Financial Officer Joe Kaeser. Guenter Gaugler, a spokesman at
Siemens, confirmed the comments by phone.  Ladbrokes Plc (LAD)  sank 8 percent to 190.3 pence after the U.K.
gambling company forecast 2013 operating profit at the lower end
of analysts’ estimates because of weaker-than-projected trading
in the first quarter. Analysts in a Bloomberg survey had
predicted  operating profit  of 188 million pounds ($288 million)
to 215 million pounds.  Roche gained 2.7 percent to 231.10 Swiss francs after
announcing that the agreement with Ascletis will enable it to
submit danoprevir to Chinese regulators by 2019. That’s sooner
that would be possible without a partner, according to Roche’s
head of Asia-Pacific.  United Utilities Plc climbed 2.5 percent to 739 pence after
the Sunday Times reported that the U.K.’s biggest publicly-
traded water company has hired Goldman Sachs as an adviser amid
speculation of a 7 billion-pound takeover offer. The newspaper
didn’t say where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
