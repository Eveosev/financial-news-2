Gold and silver producers tumbled
in London trading as the price of bullion slumped to a two-year
low after entering a  bear market  last week.  Petropavlovsk Plc (POG) , a miner of gold in  Russia , dropped as
much as 22 percent to the lowest in 10 years.  Fresnillo Plc (FRES) , the
biggest primary silver producer, fell as much as 16 percent,
while  Randgold Resources Ltd. (RRS)  declined as much as 10 percent.  The price of bullion, a haven asset, has sunk on optimism
that a U.S. economic recovery will curb the need for stimulus
spending. A price collapse last week, exacerbated by concerns
that Cyprus may sell gold, took losses to more than 20 percent
since the record close in September 2011, meeting the common
definition of a bear market.  The turn in the gold cycle is quickening and investors
should sell, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said April 10. Bullion for
immediate delivery fell 6.2 percent last week, and was down as
much as 6.5 percent at $1,385.96 an ounce today. Silver declined
as much as 11 percent to $23.02 an ounce.  “This latest rout is surprisingly severe,” Investec
Securities Ltd. said in a note to investors. “Many miners will
be feeling considerable pain. This pricing environment, if
sustained, would likely have a material adverse impact on mine
supply that would be supportive longer term.”  Petropavlovsk, which was cut to sell by Citigroup Inc.
today, traded down 18 percent at 152.7 pence as of 11:53 a.m.
London time. Randgold was down 9.7 percent at 4,477 pence, while
Fresnillo lost 15 percent to 1,077 pence. Gold producers  African
Barrick Gold Plc (ABG)  and  Centamin Plc (CEY)  also declined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
