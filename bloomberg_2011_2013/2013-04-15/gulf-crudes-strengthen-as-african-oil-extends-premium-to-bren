Light Louisiana Sweet on the  spot
market  strengthened as West African crudes reached their highest
premiums to the European benchmark in almost 18 months.  Nigerian Bonny Light on the spot market rose 20 cents to a
 premium  of $3.85 a barrel to Dated Brent at 1:28 p.m.  New York 
time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Thatâ€™s the
highest premium since Oct. 18, 2011.  LLS, the light, sweet benchmark on the  Gulf Coast , competes
with West African oils like Bonny Light for space in refineries.
The U.S. Gulf Coast imported 237,000 barrels a day from  Nigeria 
last year, compared to just 49,000 from  Norway  and the U.K.,
where Brent originates, according to the U.S. Energy Information
Administration.  LLS strengthened by 45 cents to $14.50 a barrel more than
West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,  Oklahoma , at 2:17 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet
strengthened 75 cents to a premium of $14.70.  Mars Blend, a medium-sour crude from the Gulf, strengthened
5 cents to a premium of $8.80. Poseidon crude gained 20 cents to
$8.60 over WTI.  The premium for Southern Green Canyon widened 10 cents to
$7.50. Crude from the Thunder Horse play increased its premium
by $1.10 to $12 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
