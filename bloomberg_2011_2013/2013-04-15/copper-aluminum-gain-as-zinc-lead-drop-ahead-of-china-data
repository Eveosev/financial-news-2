Zinc and lead extended declines
after industrial metals tumbled by the most in a year, while
copper and aluminum climbed ahead of  China  economic reports.  Zinc dropped as much as 0.6 percent to $1,863.75 a metric
ton on the London Metal Exchange before trading at $1,868.50 at
9:23 a.m.  Shanghai  time. Lead fell 0.3 percent to $2,043 a ton.
The  LME Index (LMEX)  of six primary base metals tumbled 2.6 percent on
April 12, the most since April 10, 2012.  China’s gross domestic product probably expanded 8 percent
in the first quarter, accelerating from 7.9 percent in the
fourth quarter, a Bloomberg News survey showed. The National
Bureau of Statistics is scheduled to release March and first-
quarter economic data at 10 a.m. local time.  “Unless data from China are much better or worse than
expected, metals will remain in a downward trajectory,” Xiong
Dabiao, an analyst at Minmetals Futures Co., said by phone from
Shanghai.  Copper for delivery in August on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell 2 percent to 54,050  yuan  ($8,729) a ton, tracking
a drop of 2.7 percent in its London counterpart on April 12.
Copper on the LME rose 0.3 percent this morning while aluminum
in London advanced 0.4 percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
