A United Nations official condemned
early marriages among Syrian girls following a  visit  to a Syrian
refugee camp in  Jordan .  “We have reports of early marriages in the camp and
outside the camp,”  Babatunde Osotimehin , executive director of
the UN Population Fund, said in a telephone interview from
Amman. “It is an unfair thing to do to a child.”  Osotimehin said his agency doesn’t have figures showing how
many girls have been married off at a young age. He urged the
camp residents to abide by Jordanian law that sets the minimum
age of marriage at 18.  Osotimehin said he has heard reports that one reason why
early marriages take place is for the girls’ safety.  Among Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon, rape was a
primary motive for their flight, the International Federation
for  Human Rights   said  in a Jan. 14 report. It said rape has been
a “significant and disturbing feature of the Syrian civil
war.”  The Syrian uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began
in March 2011 with peaceful protests that turned violent after
troops attacked the demonstrators. At least 70,000 people have
been killed, according to the UN.  To contact the reporter on this story:
