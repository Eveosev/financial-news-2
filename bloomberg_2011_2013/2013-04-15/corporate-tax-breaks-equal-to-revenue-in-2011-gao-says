U.S. corporations received $181
billion in income tax breaks in 2011 -- as much as they paid in
taxes, according to a  report  released today by the Government
Accountability Office in Washington.  The majority of the forgone revenue stems from two breaks
alone -- accelerated depreciation for  capital investment  and the
ability to defer U.S. taxes on profits earned overseas.  Measured in constant dollars, the $181 billion was the
largest total for corporate tax breaks in any year since at
least 1986, when Congress last rewrote the U.S. tax code. A
provision letting companies write off 100 percent of capital
expenses took effect in 2011, contributing to an increase in the
amount of tax breaks from the 2010 total of $116 billion.  Corporate income tax collections peaked in nominal terms in
2007 at $370 billion. They dropped during the recession as
companies’ profits shrank and Congress created tax incentives to
encourage investment. They reached a bottom of $138 billion in
2009, according to the  Office of Management and Budget .  The U.S. will exceed the 2007 corporate income tax revenue
level in 2015, according to Congressional Budget Office
projections.  Corporate Rate  U.S. lawmakers are considering lowering the 35 percent top
corporate tax rate and curtailing tax breaks. President  Barack Obama  and Republicans in Congress agree on that goal.  Reducing the rate and addressing all of the issues in the
corporate tax system will involve more than just examining the
list of tax breaks, said Daniel Shaviro, a tax law professor at
 New York  University.  The “games” played by multinational companies and the tax
code’s bias for debt financing over equity don’t show up in a
list of legislated tax breaks, he said.  The GAO report, requested by Democratic Representatives
 John Lewis  of  Georgia  and Lloyd Doggett of  Texas , was released
on the day that individual taxpayers must file their 2012
returns or seek extensions.  “Many Americans are paying their federal income taxes to
contribute their fair share to the cost of our national security
and of vital public services, but much of corporate America is
still not doing the same,” Doggett said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
