Chile’s peso fell the most this
year as an unexpected economic slowdown in  China  lowered the
price of copper, dimming the country’s export prospects.  The peso depreciated 0.3 percent to 471.90 per  U.S. dollar 
at 10:06 a.m. in Santiago after dropping 0.5 percent, the
biggest intraday decline since Dec. 24. The peso has weakened 1
percent in five days, the most among major Latin American
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “The data from China are pressuring all commodity prices
down, and investors are seeking refuge in the dollar,” Alexis Osses, an analyst at XDirect Chile Ltda. in Santiago, said in a
telephone interview.  Copper fell to a 17-month low of $3.1935 per pound after
China reported that gross domestic product expanded 7.7 percent
in the first first quarter from a year earlier compared with 7.9
percent in the last three months of 2012. The median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for 8 percent growth. China
is the world’s largest consumer of copper,  Chile ’s main export.  Chile’s currency rallied to 467.05 per dollar on April 8,
its strongest level since September 2011, spurring speculation
the central bank might intervene in the foreign-exchange market
to stem its gains. Policy makers refrained from mentioning
intervention in their statement published April 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
