The Boston Bruins’ home game
tonight against the  Ottawa Senators  has been postponed because
of the bombings near the finish line of today’s Boston Marathon,
the  National Hockey League  said in an e-mail.  The NHL said the game at the TD Garden will be rescheduled,
with the date and time to be announced later.  “After consultation with city, state and NHL officials, we
collectively made the decision to postpone tonight’s game,”
Bruins President Cam Neely said in a statement. “Public safety
personnel from the city and state are still gathering
information regarding today’s events and it is vital they have
all resources available for their investigation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
