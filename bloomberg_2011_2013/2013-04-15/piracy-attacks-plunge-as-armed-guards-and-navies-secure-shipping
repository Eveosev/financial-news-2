Piracy attacks plunged in the first
three months as armed guards and naval forces protected merchant
shipping, a group monitoring incidents worldwide said.  There were 66 incidents in the first three months of 2013
compared with 102 in the corresponding period last year, the
London-based International Maritime Bureau said in an e-mailed
report today. Four ships were hijacked, 51 were boarded, 75 crew
members were taken hostage, and one was killed.  The decline was because of interventions by naval forces
and also because more ships are being protected by armed guards,
the IMB said. Vessels are also deploying on-board security
measures to deter pirates.  “There can be no room for complacency,” IMB director
Pottengal Mukundan said in the report. “The attacks will rise
to past levels if the naval presence is reduced or vessels relax
their vigilance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
