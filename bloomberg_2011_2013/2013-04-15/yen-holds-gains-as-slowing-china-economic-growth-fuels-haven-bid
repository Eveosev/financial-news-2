The yen and dollar slid against
currencies of commodity-exporting nations including  New Zealand 
and  South Africa  as investors sought higher-yielding assets and
gold and U.S. stocks gained.  Japan ’s currency dropped versus all of its 16 most-traded
peers as investors bet a rally yesterday amid demand for a haven
was excessive. The euro climbed to a seven-week high versus the
greenback as two regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents said
the U.S. still needs monetary stimulus.  Mexico ’s peso gained
versus all of its major counterparts.  “There’s some better risk sentiment in the market,”
Charles St-Arnaud, a foreign-exchange strategist at Nomura
Holdings Inc. in  New York , said in a telephone interview. “Part
of it is correcting the weakness we saw yesterday. Equity
markets are performing relatively well today.”  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, strengthened 1
percent to 84.92 U.S. cents at 5 p.m. New York time and rallied
1.8 percent to 82.84 yen. The  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand’s
official cash rate is 2.5 percent, compared with as low as zero
in the U.S. and Japan.  The yen sank 1.9 percent to 128.52 per euro after jumping
3.5 percent during the previous two days. Japan’s currency
dropped 0.8 percent to 97.54 per dollar. The greenback fell 1.1
percent to $1.3177 per euro and touched $1.3202, the weakest
since Feb. 25. The U.S. currency gained 0.6 percent yesterday
against the euro.  Mexico’s peso gained 1.1 percent to 12.1462 per dollar. The
nation’s benchmark interest rate is 4 percent.  Rand Gains  South Africa’s rand strengthened for the first time in
three days, rebounding from the biggest one-day slump in six
months, as metal prices rallied and investors gauged the
currency’s decline was overdone. It appreciated 0.9 percent to
9.1253 per dollar and climbed as much as 1.1 percent, its
biggest intraday increase since April 8. The rand slid 2.8
percent yesterday, the most since Oct. 5.  Gold for immediate delivery climbed as much as 4.1 percent
to $1,403.48 an ounce before trading at $1,367.36, up 1.4
percent. The price tumbled 9.1 percent yesterday, the biggest
decline since 1983. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 1.4
percent, the most since Jan. 2. The equity benchmark index
plunged 2.3 percent yesterday, its largest drop since Nov. 7.  “It’s a typical retracement after a very sharp move lower
in dollar-yen and gold,”  Richard Franulovich , a senior currency
strategist at  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  in New York, said in a
telephone interview. “We’re definitely moving back to the risk-
on, risk-off theme for the time being.”  The yen and the dollar surged yesterday after  China ’s
economic growth slowed more in the first quarter than economists
forecast, fueling demand for refuge assets.  Pound Declines  Sterling fell today to the weakest level in a month against
the euro after a report showed consumer-price inflation stayed
above the  Bank of England ’s 2 percent target at the same time as
growth stagnates. The pound weakened 0.6 percent to 85.78 pence
per euro after touching 86.02, the least since March 15. The
currency appreciated 0.5 percent to $1.5362.  The dollar fell against the euro as  Chicago  Fed Bank
President  Charles Evans  said the  U.S. economy  still needs
monetary stimulus, and New York Fed President William C. Dudley
said a March slowdown in employment growth highlighted the need
to maintain the current pace of bond purchases. Evans gave a
speech in Chicago, and Dudley spoke in  Staten Island , New York.  The Fed is buying $85 billion of bonds each month until it
sees significant improvement in the labor market. Jobs growth
unexpectedly slowed last month, Labor Department data showed
April 5, as payrolls added 88,000 workers, less than half the
190,000 forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  Lower Inflation  A government report today indicated that inflation in the
U.S. is being contained, giving the Fed more room for stimulus.  The U.S. consumer-price index fell 0.2 percent last month,
Labor Department figures showed. For the 12 months that ended in
March, consumer prices increased 1.5 percent, the smallest gain
since July. The central bank’s inflation target is 2 percent.  The decline in CPI came as gold has slid from a price of
more than $1,600 an ounce as recently as April 2. Some investors
buy the precious metal as a hedge to protect against inflation.  The greenback dropped 0.7 percent in the past month against
nine developed-nation peers monitored by Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes. The yen fell 3.3 percent, making it the worst
performer, while the euro gained 0.2 percent.  Yen Volatility  Options traders raised bets on yen volatility amid
speculation Japan will face pressure from Group of 20 peers over
policies that have weakened its currency.  One-week implied volatility for the dollar-yen rate, based
on currency option prices, increased 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, to 13.4 percent. The measure has averaged 12.8
percent this year.  The Japanese currency may weaken to 100 at some point in
May,  Neil Jones , head of European hedge-fund sales at Mizuho
Corporate Bank Ltd. in  London , said in an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s “Countdown” with  Mark Barton  and Anna Edwards.  The yen slid last week to 99.95 to the dollar, the weakest
level since April 2009, following the  Bank of Japan (8301) ’s
announcement on April 4 of unprecedented stimulus measures.  The BOJ said it would increase bond purchases and double
the nation’s monetary base by the end of 2014 as it fights
deflation. The central bank’s current-account balance increased
to a record 61.4 trillion yen ($628 billion) yesterday, the BOJ
said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
