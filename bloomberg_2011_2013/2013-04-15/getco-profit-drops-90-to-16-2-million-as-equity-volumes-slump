Getco LLC earnings plunged 90
percent last year as stock-market volume fell and volatility
evaporated.  Net income dropped to $16.2 million last year from $162.7
million in 2011, according to a regulatory filing today. Revenue
declined 40 percent to $551.5 million, the company said. Getco
agreed to buy  Knight Capital Group Inc. (KCG)  in a $1.4 billion deal
after the market maker lost more than $450 million when
computers generated a flood of erroneous orders in August.  Merging the two companies will generate savings of as much
as $110 million a year through cost reductions, the companies
said. The elimination of redundancies in infrastructure and
personnel will help cut expenses by $20 million to $30 million
during the first year of the merger. Annual savings will
increase to $90 million to $110 million by the third year.  The shares will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange
under a revised plan where existing  stockholders  can exchange
three shares for one share of the combined company. The original
agreement was one for one. The change, which doesn’t affect the
total paid to  Knight Capital ’s shareholders, is aimed to meet
NYSE’s requirement for a minimum share price of $4 at the time
of listing, the companies said. Knight Capital closed at $3.74
on April 12.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange  Volatility Index (VIX) , known
as the VIX, dropped 23 percent last year and reached a six-year
low in March. Average daily  volume  for stocks listed on U.S.
exchanges has declined every year since 2009, falling 18 percent
in 2012 to a low of 6.42 billion shares, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with 9.77 billion in 2009
and 6.30 billion so far in 2013.  Knight Capital said in January that fourth-quarter  profit 
declined 84 percent after trading slowed and stock-price swings
narrowed. The company said in February that it will reduce its
workforce by 5 percent as it combines sales teams and
discontinues its clearing business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
