Pearson Plc (PSON) , which owns the
Financial Times newspaper, has agreed to sell its 50 percent
stake in publisher BDFM Publishers Ltd. to South Africa’s  Times
Media Group Ltd. (TMG) , the Johannesburg-based company said today.  Times Media, which owns 50 percent of BDFM, will acquire
Pearson’s share in the South African joint venture, according to
an e-mailed statement today. BDFM publishes daily newspaper
Business Day and weekly magazine Financial Mail and owns African
Broadcasting Channel.  The deal “will allow for economies of scale, an integrated
operations platform and operational synergies, and will permit
BDFM, under unified ownership, to accelerate its digital
transformation,” Times Media said in the statement.  Times Media Group didn’t include financial details on the
deal in the statement. A spokesman for the company wasn’t
immediately available for comment. A Pearson spokesman confirmed
the transaction.  Pearson fell 2 percent to 1,120 pence at 8:30 a.m. in
