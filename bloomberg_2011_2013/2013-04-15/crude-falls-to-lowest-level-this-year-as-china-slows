West Texas Intermediate crude fell
to the lowest level this year as  China ’s economic growth
unexpectedly eased, raising concern that demand from the world’s
second-biggest oil-consuming country will slow.  Prices dropped below $90 as China’s first-quarter  gross
domestic product  gained 7.7 percent from a year earlier, the
National Bureau of Statistics reported in Beijing. That’s less
than the 8 percent forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists
and the 7.9 percent expansion in the fourth quarter. China’s oil
use was the least in five months in March, the data showed.
Commodities tumbled, with gold plunging the most in 33 years.  “We are seeing a selling frenzy right now, and the global
macroeconomic picture is rather dim,” said  Stephen Schork ,
president of the Schork Group Inc. in Villanova,  Pennsylvania .
“You’ve got a lot of weight being placed on the bearish side of
the oil market. It’s really hard to see where the growth is.”  WTI for May delivery decreased $2.58, or 2.8 percent, to
settle at $88.71 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
the lowest settlement since Dec. 24. Prices extended losses
after floor trading closed, dropping as much as 4.5 percent to
$87.20 in electronic trading. The volume of all futures traded
was 69 percent above the 100-day average at 5:14 p.m.  Brent for May settlement, which expired today, fell $2.72,
or 2.6 percent, to $100.39 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange, the least since July 11. Volume was 28
percent above the 100-day average. The more actively traded June
contract slid $2.41 to end the session at $100.63. The contract
decreased as much as 3.8 percent to $99.12 after the settlement.  Commodities Drop  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities plunged
2.3 percent to 608.83, the lowest level since July. Silver, gold
and WTI oil led the decline. Gold futures slumped 9.3 percent in
 New York  in the biggest drop for a most-active contract since
March 17, 1980.  “China’s GDP is part of the reason that the market is
selling off in general,” said Julius Walker, global energy
markets strategist at UBS Securities LLC. Oil’s drop “is more
related to the broad market fall.”  China’s first-quarter growth was lower than all except two
of the 41 analyst estimates in the Bloomberg survey. They ranged
from 7.5 percent to 8.3 percent. Chinese GDP expanded 7.8
percent in 2012, the least since 1999.  JPMorgan (JPM)  today cut its 2013 growth forecast to 7.8 percent
from 8.2 percent, while  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  lowered
its estimate to 7.8 percent from 8.4 percent.  Oil is “part of a wider wave of selling across a broad
range of commodities after China reported weaker GDP growth for
the first quarter than expected,” said  Tim Evans , an energy
analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York, in an e-mail.  Chinese Demand  China used 9.76 million barrels of oil in 2011, according
to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical Review of World Energy, behind only the
U.S. in terms of oil consumption.  China’s apparent oil demand in March grew 2.7 percent from
a year earlier to 9.77 million barrels a day, according to
statistics bureau data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s down from
February’s 10.2 million and is the lowest level since October.  Slower economic growth “translates into weaker oil demand
growth, but we think development there is still pretty energy
intensive,” Walker said.  Oil also fell as  manufacturing  in the New York region
expanded less than projected in April. The Federal Reserve Bank
of New York’s general economic  index  dropped to 3.1 this month
from 9.2 in March. Readings exceeding zero signal expansion in
New York, northern  New Jersey  and southern  Connecticut .  Gold Tumbles  Gold slumped below $1,400 an ounce, ending the session at
$1,361.10 on the Comex in New York. After the settlement, the
price touched $1,335.10, the least since Feb. 3, 2011. Estimated
trading levels topped a previous record.  “Let’s not forget what’s happening in gold,” Schork said.
“You could be seeing margin calls in gold and commodity funds
offsetting these calls by liquidating some of their lengths in
WTI.”  In  Venezuela , the third-biggest oil producer in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Nicolas Maduro
was elected president. Maduro campaigned on a pledge to deepen
14 years of the late Hugo Chavez’s socialist revolution.  A Maduro presidency could see “a further degradation of
the state oil company and the country’s oil prospects,” the
 International Energy Agency  said in its monthly oil market
report March 13.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
June was 26.6 percent, up from 20.6 percent April 12.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 791,616
contracts as of 5:14 p.m. It totaled 861,748 contracts on April
12, 48 percent above the three-month average and the most since
Jan. 23. Open interest was a record 1.78 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
