Portugal ’s government is selling a
plot of land in Berlin’s diplomatic quarter as part of a plan to
raise 30 million euros ($39 million) from real estate around the
world.  The site in Berlin’s Tiergarten district amounts to 2,800
square meters (30,000 square feet), according to Cushman &
Wakefield Inc., which is advising the government on the sale.  Portugal announced a plan last year to sell real estate in
countries include  Germany  and the U.S. to lower its property-
maintenance costs. The government sold an apartment in New
York’s Dakota building earlier this year. It’s also looking for
buyers for its consulate building in the French city of
Clermont-Ferrand and part of its consulate in  Rio de Janeiro ,
according to Miguel Guedes, a spokesman for Portugal’s Foreign
Affairs Ministry.  The southern European nation was the third euro member to
seek a rescue when it got 78 billion euros in 2011 following
Greece and Ireland. The country is facing new barriers to
meeting aid requirements and is promising further budget cuts
after its  Constitutional Court  earlier this month blocked a
proposal to suspend a payment to state workers and pensioners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
