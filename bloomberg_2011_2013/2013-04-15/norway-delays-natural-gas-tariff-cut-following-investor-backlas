Norway , western  Europe ’s largest
gas exporter, will delay proposed cuts to tariffs on natural gas
transported through the Gassled pipeline network after being
overwhelmed by reactions to the plan.  The planned 90 percent cut in gas transport tariffs, which
was due to come into effect from May 1, will be delayed as the
Oil and Energy Ministry considers replies submitted in response
to the plan, it said today.  “We can confirm that we are aiming for changes in the
tariff regulation to come into force July 1,” ministry
spokesman Jon Evang said in an e-mailed response to questions.
“The ministry has received extensive submissions and will need
more time.”  Norway, which is planning to cut tariffs in the network to
make more gas discoveries profitable while boosting exploration
and recovery rates, has received criticism from investors in the
pipeline and their lenders. Investors argue the cut would reduce
returns to 4 percent, well below their projected minimum of 7
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
