Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , the U.K. explorer
searching for  Ethiopia ’s first crude, fell to a 19-month low in
London trading after delaying the Sabisa well.  The  shares  slumped 5.4 percent to 1,097 pence, the lowest
price since September 2011.  “Hole instability issues have required the drilling of a
sidetrack,” or secondary wellbore, the London-based company
said today in a statement. “The sidetrack recently commenced
and a result is now expected in late May,” rather than in March
as previously planned.  Tullow’s partner in the project,  Africa Oil Corp. (AOI) , has lost
almost 10 percent in Toronto since April 12 when shareholder
Lukas Lundin said drilling had been set back by technical
difficulties. The exploration group, which also includes
 Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO) , has drilled Sabisa in western Ethiopia to
1,810 meters (5,940 feet) and found evidence of hydrocarbons in
sands, Tullow said today.  “Encountering a sand formation with hydrocarbons gives a
promising initial indication that this basin has potential,”
 Oswald Clint , a London-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &
Co., wrote in an e-mailed report.  Separately, the company said its Ngamia-1 well in  Kenya 
flowed 281 barrels of oil a day during tests. Tullow and Africa
Oil announced Kenya’s first oil discovery at Ngamia-1 in the
Turkana region in March last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
