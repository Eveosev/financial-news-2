Barclays Plc (BARC)  lawyers told a London
court it was a “fantasy” that employees communicated in secret
to make a competing bid for carbon-trading firm Tricorona AB in
2010.  CF Partners (U.K.) LLP, which is suing Barclays over the
$173 million deal, argues the bank used confidential information
acquired while it was advising CF Partners plan to take over
Tricorona. The company has previously introduced transcripts of
phone conversations of Barclays employees talking about the
takeover.  CF Partners says the calls indicate Barclays discussed
buying Tricorona as early as 2009, while urging caution because
of an exclusivity agreement with CF Partners, a London-based
trading firm. The company, which focuses on renewable energy, is
seeking at least 82.4 million euros ($107.8 million), according
to court papers.  “The case that has evolved about a secret line of
communication is a fantasy,” Ewan McQuater, the bank’s lawyer,
said at today’s hearing.  The length of the trial, scheduled for mid-May, was
extended by two weeks to two months at today’s hearing.  “This case is entirely without merit and Barclays will be
contesting it vigorously,” Aurelie Leonard, a spokeswoman for
London-based Barclays, said in an e-mailed statement. “Being a
leader in  emissions trading , Barclays already had a relationship
with Tricorona before it had any involvement with CF Partners.”  The bank said it didn’t have an advisory relationship with
CF Partners.  Kevin Smith , a spokesman for CF Partners, declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
