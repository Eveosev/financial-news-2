Mark Owen-Lloyd started at  Clean
Energy Trading Ltd.  in  London  as a trading director for European
power, natural gas, carbon and crude.  Owen-Lloyd, 52, joined from Leap Trading Ltd., which he co-
founded in September with Simon Gadd, who remains head of
origination and sales at Leap Trading, he said by telephone.  Clean Energy Trading now has three traders in Vlissingen in
the Netherlands and two in London, Owen-Lloyd said. The team
will be market-making on IntercontinentalExchange Inc.,  CME
Group Inc. (CME) , and European Energy Exchange AG.  “We are looking to hire another trader in the next six
months,” Owen-Lloyd said. He was previously a cross-commodity
director at CF Partners and head of U.K. power and carbon
trading at EON AG.  Leap Energy hired Phil Westwood as a gas market maker in
London in December, Gadd said by e-mail on April 12. Westwood
previously worked at NatWest Capital Markets Ltd. and Goldenberg
Hehmeyer & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
