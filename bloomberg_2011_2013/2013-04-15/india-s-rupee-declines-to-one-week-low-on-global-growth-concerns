India ’s rupee declined to the
lowest level in a week on concern slowing global growth will
damp demand for the nation’s equities.  Official data today showed  China ’s first-quarter gross
domestic product rose 7.7 percent, less than the 8 percent
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 41 economists.
India’s S&P BSE  Sensex (SENSEX)  stock index dropped for a second day as
global funds sold $103 million more shares than they bought in
the first three days of last week, paring this year’s inflow to
$10 billion, exchange data show.  “I am concerned about the impact of the Chinese data on
Indian stocks and the hot-money inflows we have seen this
year,” said  Paresh Nayar , head of money markets and  currency
trading  at FirstRand Ltd. in Mumbai. “We have a domestic growth
story that isn’t that great and now a slowdown in global growth
will further pressure the rupee.”  The currency declined 0.5 percent to 54.77 per dollar as of
9:54 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 54.7825 earlier, the weakest since April 8. One-month
implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the  exchange
rate  used to price options, rose 14 basis points, or 0.14
percentage point, to 7.67 percent.  Current Account  Investors will be watching Indian trade data due this week
to gauge the impact of falling global oil and gold prices on the
country’s record current-account deficit, Nayar said. While
easing crude costs will give “some respite” to a nation that
imports more than 80 percent of its oil needs, demand for the
precious metal may revive with a fall in prices, he said.  Gold, which plunged into a  bear market  last week, dropped
2.5 percent today while oil has fallen 3.4 percent in the past
week, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Wholesale price-based
 inflation  in India slowed to a 40-month low of 6.27 percent last
month, according to the median of 29 estimates in a Bloomberg
survey before data due around noon in  New Delhi  today.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.79 per
dollar, compared with 55.59 on April 12, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.70 versus 55.48. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
