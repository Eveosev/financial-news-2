The  Bank of Japan (8301)  raised its
assessment of all its regions for the first time since July
2012, citing a pickup in the global economy and resilient
domestic demand, after unveiling unprecedented easing measures
earlier this month.  The central bank became more upbeat about all nine regions,
it said today in the quarterly Sakura Report, the equivalent of
the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Beige Book. The report groups the
nation’s 47 prefectures into nine geographic regions.  The upgrades highlight Governor Haruhiko Kuroda’s
confidence in the world’s third-largest economy as  household  and
 company  sentiment improve on a weakening yen and rising stocks
and profits. The BOJ may raise its inflation outlook later this
month, people familiar with the matter told  Bloomberg News  last
week.  “ Japan ’s economy has stopped weakening and has shown signs
of improvement,” Kuroda  said  today at his first branch
managers’ meeting in Tokyo, according to the central bank. The
BOJ’s easing “will lead Japan’s economy to overcome
deflation.”  Kuroda aims to achieve 2 percent inflation in two years.
The bank will review its forecasts for prices and economic
growth at a meeting on April 26.  The yen has fallen about 12 percent against the dollar this
year. It rose today after a report showed Chinese growth
unexpectedly slowed in the first quarter, fueling demand for
haven assets. The Japanese currency added 0.5 percent to 97.91
as of 3:03 p.m. in  Tokyo  after earlier touching 97.55, the
strongest since April 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
