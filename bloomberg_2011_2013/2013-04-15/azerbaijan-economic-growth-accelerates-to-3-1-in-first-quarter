Azerbaijan’s economy expanded 3.1
percent in the first quarter from 2012 as surging non-energy
output outweighed a decline in oil and natural gas production.  The non-oil economy grew 11 percent in the first three
months, the State Statistics Committee based in Baku, the Azeri
capital, said today on its  website . The Caspian Sea nation’s
gross domestic product expanded 2.2 percent in 2012, compared
with 0.1 percent a year earlier, the committee said in January.  Crude oil output fell 4.4 percent to 10.8 million metric
tons and production of marketable natural-gas dropped 4.3
percent to 4.4 billion cubic meters, it said. Inflation slowed
to 1.2 percent on an annual basis in the first three months from
3.1 percent a year earlier, the committee said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
