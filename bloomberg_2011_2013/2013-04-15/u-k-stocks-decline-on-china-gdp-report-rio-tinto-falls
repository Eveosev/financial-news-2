U.K. stocks  declined, following the
second-biggest weekly increase this year for the benchmark
index, as slower-than-forecast economic growth in China led to a
selloff in the shares of mining companies.  Randgold Resources Ltd. (RRS) , Polymetal International Plc and
 Fresnillo Plc (FRES)  each slumped at least 8 percent as gold plunged
the most in three decades and silver fell to a 2 1/2-year low.
 United Utilities Group Plc (UU/)  gained 2.5 percent after a report
that the water company hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. amid
speculation of a takeover bid.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  fell 40.79 points, or 0.6 percent, to
6,343.6 at the close in  London . The gauge climbed 2.2 percent
last week, its biggest advance since early January, as Chinese
imports beat forecasts. The broader FTSE All-Share Index slid
0.7 percent and Ireland’s ISEQ Index dropped 0.5 percent today.  “Mining stocks have taken their cue from the weaker-than-
expected first-quarter GDP figures from  China ,” Jeremy Batstone-Carr, head of research at Charles Stanley Group Plc in
London, said in a telephone interview. “Miners are being driven
down by the metal slamdown, with the U.K. underperforming
relative to other benchmark indexes.”  In China,  gross domestic product  rose 7.7 percent in the
first quarter, the National Bureau of Statistics said in
Beijing. That compares with the 8 percent median forecast by
analysts in a Bloomberg News survey and 7.9 percent in the
fourth quarter. March industrial production increased less than
estimated, while retail-sales growth matched forecasts.  U.S. Manufacturing  Data showed  manufacturing  this month in the New York region
expanded less than projected. The Federal Reserve Bank of New
York’s general economic  index  dropped to 3.1 in April from 9.2
in March. Readings exceeding zero signal expansion in New York,
northern New Jersey and southern  Connecticut . The median
projection of 47 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 7.  Britain’s economy will grow less than previously forecast
this year and further bond purchases by the Bank of England may
do little to stimulate the recovery, according to the Ernst &
Young Item Club.  Gross domestic product will rise 0.6 percent, compared with
a January forecast of 0.9 percent, the London-based group said
in a report. Growth will accelerate to 1.9 percent next year and
2.5 percent in 2015, in line with previous estimates.  Precious Metals  Randgold, a gold miner in  Africa , declined 8.3 percent to
4,545 pence. Polymetal plunged 13 percent to 746 pence, the
biggest loss since it sold shares to the public in October 2011.
Fresnillo, the biggest primary silver producer, tumbled 15
percent to 1,080 pence, the largest drop since October 2008.  Gold plummeted 7.3 percent at 4:35 p.m. in London, the most
since 1983, after sliding into a bear market last week. Silver
fell 9.9 percent to the lowest price since October 2010.  Rio Tinto Group, the world’s second-largest mining company,
lost 3.5 percent to 2,973 pence.  BHP Billiton Plc (BLT) , the biggest,
retreated 3.6 percent to 1,824.5 pence.  Ladbrokes Plc (LAD)  slumped 8 percent to 190.3 pence, the lowest
price since November. The U.K. gambling operator said it expects
full-year operating profit to come in at the bottom of the
projected range.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,  Europe ’s largest bank, lost 1 percent to
681.4 pence. HSBC’s Swiss private bank was an “open door” for
money laundering and terrorist finance because managers failed
to exercise controls, said Herve Falciani, a former software
technician accused of stealing data, said.  HSBC, Europe’s largest bank by market value, has said it
became aware in 2008 that Falciani had stolen details on 24,000
accounts from its private bank in Geneva. Falciani cooperated
with French investigators who used the data to search for tax
dodgers and shared the information with Italian, Spanish and
British prosecutors.  Takeover Bid  United Utilities gained 2.5 percent to 739 pence. Britain’s
largest publicly traded water company hired Goldman Sachs amid
speculation of a possible 7 billion-pound ($10.7 billion)
takeover bid, the Sunday Times reported, without saying where it
got the information.  Betfair Group Plc (BET)  surged 12 percent to 782 pence, the
biggest jump since October 2010. CVC Capital Partners Ltd. said
it had preliminary talks with Richard Koch, Antony Ball and
partners about a possible offer for the company.  The volume of shares changing hands in FTSE 100-listed
companies was 19 percent lower than the average of the past 30
days, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
