Sweden  cut its  economic growth 
forecast for 2014 after a strong krona added to the effect of
 Europe ’s debt crisis to undermine demand for exports.  The largest Nordic economy will expand 2.2 percent next
year, compared with a December estimate of 3 percent, Finance
Minister  Anders Borg  said in Stockholm today. Gross domestic
product will grow 1.2 percent this year, he said. The economy
grew 0.8 percent in 2012, according to the latest official
figures.  “We still have a serious situation with the crisis in
Europe,” Borg told reporters at the Finance Ministry today.
“For Sweden, this means a slow and protracted recovery, both
during 2013 and 2014.”  AAA rated Sweden emerged as a haven from Europe’s debt
crisis last year, only to watch its currency appreciate more
than its developed-world peers over the past 12 months, hurting
exporters and killing jobs. The  unemployment rate  will rise to
an average of 8.4 percent in 2014, Borg estimates -- that’s the
highest rate in Scandinavia.  The krona has gained 7.9 percent on a correlation-weighted
basis against a basket of nine other developed-world currencies
tracked by Bloomberg over the past 12 months. It’s up about 6
percent against the euro over the same period.  Krona Slides  The krona lost as much as 0.4 percent before trading at
8.3512 per euro as of 10:36 a.m. local time. Versus the dollar,
it sank 0.6 percent to 6.3938.  The yield on Sweden’s benchmark two-year note was little
changed at 0.971 percent. Its 10-year yield eased half a basis
point to 1.68 percent.  Sluggish economic growth means the government of Prime
Minister  Fredrik Reinfeldt  will post a  budget deficit  in both
2013 and 2014, Borg said. The shortfall will reach 1.6 percent
of GDP this year and narrow to 1 percent in 2014. Sweden’s
budget will be in balance in 2015, he said.  “There is continued big uncertainty and the risks are more
on the downside than on the upside,” Borg said. “There are
significant uncertainties in Europe and there is a risk that the
situation will worsen.”  Sweden, which generates half its economic output from
exports, of which 70 percent are destined for Europe, will lose
more jobs next year as a result of weak demand in the euro area,
Borg said. He said the crisis in the euro area represents a
bigger risk to Sweden than the strong krona.  Debt Outlook  The government isn’t planning additional measures to reduce
debt as it focuses on creating jobs, Borg also said. While debt
should come down “at some point,” the government can’t cut its
borrowing when unemployment is still high, he said.  Sweden’s total debt burden, including borrowing by
municipalities, will reach 42 percent of GDP this year, the
 Finance Ministry  said today. Debt will ease to 41.8 percent of
GDP next year and 39.5 percent in 2015, it said. Debt by that
measure was 38.2 percent in 2012.  Hans Lindblad, the head of Sweden’s debt office, said in an
interview last week that even a debt load of 30 percent to GDP
is no guarantee against risks. Especially nations with large
financial industries should target lower debt levels, he said.  Crisis Buffers  Borg said today governments need to ensure the they have
large enough buffers to stay within the EU’s 60 percent debt
limit even after suffering a potential banking crisis.  The ruling four-party coalition said last week said it will
add about 3 billion kronor to education and infrastructure
spending this year and next to cut the jobless rate. It also
proposed changes to the country’s taxation system to make it
more profitable for smaller companies to hire and expand.  The government has cut income taxes by 70 billion kronor
($11 billion), or about 2 percent of the economy, lowered
unemployment and sickness benefits, and abolished a levy on
wealth to encourage entrepreneurship and to get more people to
join the workforce. In January, the government cut the corporate
 tax rate  to 22 percent, following a cut to 26.3 percent from 28
percent in 2009.  Sweden’s central bank has lowered its  main lending rate 
four times since December 2011 to boost growth. The rate is 1
percent, a quarter of a percentage point higher than the
benchmark set by the  European Central Bank  for the euro area.  The government said today it predicts Sweden’s repo rate
will be 1 percent through the end of 2014, before rising to 1.75
percent by the end of 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
