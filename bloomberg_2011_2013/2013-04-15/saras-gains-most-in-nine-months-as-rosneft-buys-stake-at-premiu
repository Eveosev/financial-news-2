Saras SpA (SRS) , the Italian oil refiner
that turned unprofitable last year, rose the most in nine months
in Milan trading after  OAO Rosneft (ROSN)  bought a stake at a premium.  The  shares  jumped as much as 11 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since June 29. Trading volumes were more than
seven times the three-month daily average.  Rosneft,  Russia ’s biggest oil producer, bid 1.37 euros a
share for 7.3 percent of the company through its Rosneft JV
Projects subsidiary, it said in a statement. That’s a premium of
47 percent to the average share price over the past 20 days.  Rosneft also said it will buy a further 13.7 percent of
Saras from controlling shareholder Angelo Moratti Sapa, Chairman
Gian Marco Moratti and Chief Executive Officer Massimo Moratti
for 178.5 million euros ($233.7 million). Angelo Moratti Sapa
will retain a 50.02 percent stake in the refiner after the sale.  Refiners in  Europe  are increasingly teaming up with crude
producers as falling fuel demand, economic stagnation and rising
Brent oil prices squeeze profits. Milan-based Saras, which had a
90.1 million-euro net loss last year, agreed in December to form
a 50-50 venture with Rosneft to process crude and sell products.  Saras traded up 7.3 percent at 1.047 euros as of 4:13 p.m.
Milan time, valuing the company at 995.7 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
