Spanish  government bonds  dropped
for a third day after a report showed China’s economic growth
unexpectedly slowed in the first quarter, damping demand for
Europe’s higher-yielding assets.  Spain ’s 10-year bonds led declines as the nation prepared
to auction debt due between 2016 and 2023 on April 18. Italian
securities also fell even as the Treasury said demand for an
inflation-linked bond aimed at retail investors has exceeded the
amount sold in the first day of the previous sale. European
 stocks  retreated, following their biggest weekly gain in a
month. German 10-year bunds rose, pushing the yield toward an
eight-month low.  “After the weaker-than-expected Chinese growth data, risk-
off was the prevalent theme,” said  Richard McGuire , a senior
fixed-income strategist at Rabobank International in  London .
“That has seemingly continued in European equity markets. There
also maybe some concession building ahead of this week’s supply
from Spain.”  The yield on Spain’s 10-year bond increased four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 4.73 percent at 4:27 p.m.
London time. The rate dropped to 4.61 percent on April 11, the
least since November 2010. The 5.4 percent security due January
2023 fell 0.315, or 3.15 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,309) face
amount, to 105.14. The two-year rate added two basis points to
2.13 percent.  Chinese Growth  Chinese  gross domestic product  rose 7.7 percent from a year
earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said in Beijing
today. That compares with the 8 percent median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of 41 analysts, and 7.9 percent in the
fourth quarter. March industrial production increased less than
estimated while retail-sales growth matched forecasts.  A separate report showed euro-area exports rose a
seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent from January, when they
increased 1.9 percent, the European Union’s statistics office in
Luxembourg said today. Imports decreased 2.1 percent after a 2.9
percent gain in January.  German 10-year bund yields fell two basis points to 1.25
percent, after sliding to 1.20 percent on April 5, a day after
the  Bank of Japan (8301)  said it would double its asset purchases to
boost the economy. That’s the lowest yield since July 24.  “The 10-year German bund overreacted to the news of bond-
buying programs from the Bank of  Japan ,” said Alessandro Giansanti, a senior rates strategist at ING Groep NV in
Amsterdam. “We are trading close to historically low levels.”  Italian Sale  The Italian Treasury received orders for 2.9 billion euros
of the four-year bonds by 11:06 a.m. in  Rome  compared with 2.48
billion euros at the end of the first day of the last sale of
the securities in October. The order period ends April 18,
though the Treasury has said it may close the sale earlier if
demand is particularly strong.  The rate on Italian 10-year bonds rose two basis points to
4.34 percent.  Volatility on Dutch bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of Finland and Ireland,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  The Netherlands allotted 1.46 billion euros of bills due in
July at an average yield of minus 0.027 percent, as well as 1.37
billion euros of securities maturing in October at minus 0.011
percent.  France  sold 7.7 billion euros of bills maturing between
91 and 350 days.  Greek 10-year bonds were little changed after international
policy makers reached agreement to ensure a rescue package
remains on track.  Staff teams from the European Commission, the  European
Central Bank  and the  International Monetary Fund  have concluded
their review mission to  Greece , the EU, ECB and IMF said in
statement today.  Greece’s 10-year yield was at 11.39 percent, after rising
10 basis points in the previous two days.  German bonds returned 0.7 percent this year through April
12, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian bonds gained
2 percent and Spanish bonds added 5.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
