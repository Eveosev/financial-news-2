Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  fell by the most in two weeks as  China ’s economic
growth unexpectedly eased in the first quarter, sparking a slump
in commodities.  The contract for October delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell as much as 2.4 percent, the most since April 1, to
3,745  yuan  ($605) a metric ton and was at 3,749 yuan at 10:49
a.m. local time.  China’s gross domestic product rose 7.7 percent from a year
earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said in Beijing today.
That compares with the 8 percent median forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey of 41 analysts and 7.9 percent in the fourth quarter.
March industrial production gained less than estimated while
retail-sales growth matched forecasts.  “Rebar is the collateral damage of this across-the-board
selloff in industrial commodities,” Yu Yang, analyst at Shenyin
& Wanguo Futures Co., said by phone from Shanghai today.  The spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port was little changed at
$141.00 a dry ton on April 12, The Steel Index Ltd. data show.
The average  spot price  of rebar was little changed at 3,645 yuan
a ton on the same day, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
