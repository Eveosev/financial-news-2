Indonesia’s 10-year bonds advanced
for a fifth day, the longest winning streak since January, after
the government rejected offers at a debt auction last week in a
sign it can tame inflation.  The benchmark notes began the rally after the  finance
ministry  raised 4.5 trillion rupiah ($463 million) in an April 9
 auction , shy of its 7 trillion rupiah target. Investors asked
for yields as high as 5.50 percent for five-year bonds and the
average yield granted was 5.23 percent, while the government
rejected all bids for debt maturing in 2023. Consumer prices
gained 5.90 percent last month, the most since May 2011.  “The government limited the supply and refused to grant
the higher rates demanded, showing confidence inflation will
ease,” said Herdi Wibowo, head of debt capital markets at PT
BCA Sekuritas, a unit of the nation’s largest bank by market
value. “Inflation will not accelerate from March as food prices
should already moderate.”  The yield on the 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023 dropped
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage ppoint, to 5.44 percent
as of 8:36 a.m. in Jakarta, the lowest since March 13, prices
from the Inter Dealer Market Association show.  The cost to insure  Indonesia ’s debt using five-year credit-
default swaps fell 16 basis points last week to 143, the biggest
decline since November, according to CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  The rupiah traded at 9,709 per dollar, little changed from
the April 12 close of 9,713, prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg show. The currency’s one-month non-deliverable
forwards were steady at 9,709 per dollar, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivatives was set at
9,710 on April 12 by the Association of Banks in  Singapore , from
9,688 the previous day. Today’s rate will be released at 11:30
a.m. in the city-state. One-month implied volatility, a measure
of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
climbed six basis points to 5.93 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
