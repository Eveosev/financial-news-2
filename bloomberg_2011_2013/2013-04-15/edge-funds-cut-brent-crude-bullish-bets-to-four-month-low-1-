Hedge funds and other money
managers cut  bullish bets  on Brent crude to the lowest level in
four months, according to data from ICE Futures  Europe .  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered long positions by 116,880 lots in
the week ended April 9, the London-based exchange said today in
its weekly Commitment of Traders report. The cut of 25,212
contracts, or 18 percent, is the first in four weeks and reduces
net-longs to the lowest since Dec. 18.  Bearish positions by  producers , merchants, processors and
users of Brent outnumbered bullish positions by 250,129
contracts, down by 16,605, or 6.2 percent, for the first
decrease in six weeks.  Brent crude tumbled 4 percent to $106.23 a barrel in the
week to April 9 on the ICE exchange, and traded for $101.25 a
barrel at 12:22 p.m. London time today.  Swaps dealers  were net-long 168,874 lots, up 14,447 or 9.4
percent from a week earlier, in an eighth straight increase to
their highest level since the data began.  Money managers’ net-long bets on  gasoil  futures decreased
by 12,572 contracts, or 27.6 percent, to 32,944, the lowest
level since July, the data show.  ICE publishes, usually each Monday, aggregate numbers for
long and short positions for speculators such as hedge funds and
institutional investors, as well as commercial companies that
buy or sell futures to protect against price moves. Analysts and
investors follow changes in speculators’ positions because such
transactions can reflect an expectation of a change in prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
