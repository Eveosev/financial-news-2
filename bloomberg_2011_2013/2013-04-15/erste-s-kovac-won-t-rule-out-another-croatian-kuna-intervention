The  Croatian central bank  may
intervene again to support the sliding kuna as the government’s
recent dollar-bond sale boosted expectations for increased
liquidity in the currency, an Erste Bank economist said.  The central bank on April 12 sold 214.9 million euros ($280
million) at 7.607781 kuna per euro, after the Croatian currency
slipped to 7.62, its weakest since 2004. The  government  on March
26 sold $1.5 billion of 10-year bonds in international markets
and will gradually convert the funds.  “If pressure on the kuna piles up again, I wouldn’t rule
out another intervention,” Alen Kovac, the chief economist at
Erste Banka d.d., a unit of  Austria ’s  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) , said
in a phone interview in Zagreb today. “There are no firm
limits, but we expect the kuna to fluctuate between 7.60 to 7.65
per euro.”  Croatia, which will join the European Union on July 1, is
tapping markets for financing to keep the budget deficit under
control and help steer its economy out of recession. Croatia’s
gross domestic product contracted for a fifth quarter as
consumption, investment and industrial production continued to
decline amid  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis.  GDP shrank 2 percent last year, after stagnating in 2011
and contracting in the two years before that. Industrial output
declined 3.4 percent in January from a year ago, while retail
trade in the same month fell 5.3 percent, according to a
preliminary report.  Currency Peg  Kuna, which the central bank keeps pegged to the euro, was
trading at 7.6130 per euro at 13:42 in Zagreb, according to
Bloomberg data. Pressures should ease with the arrival of
tourist season, Kovac said.  Croatia  reduced its 2013 GDP forecast on Feb. 20 to 0.7
percent growth, from an earlier estimate of 1.8 percent, citing
lack of investment and a continuing crisis in the euro zone.  The  International Monetary Fund  said on Jan. 21 that
Croatia’s economy will stagnate this year. It urged the
government to remove barriers to investment and employment in
order to return to growth.  The  European Commission  said Feb. 22 that the economy will
contract 0.4 percent this year, before returning to “modest
growth” in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
