The Australian dollar held gains
from last week before data forecast to show  China’s economy  grew
at the fastest pace in a year, boosting trade prospects.  The so-called Aussie was near a three-month high against
the U.S. currency before a report that may show home loans
increased in  Australia . Local bonds rose as global stocks fell,
increasing demand for safer assets. The cost to protect against
gains in the currency was near the lowest in 3 1/2 years before
the  Reserve Bank  of Australia releases tomorrow the minutes of
this month’s meeting, when policy makers refrained from cutting
 interest rates .  “If the numbers from  China  are reasonably solid, it will
be supportive of the Australian dollar,” said Hans Kunnen,
chief economist in Sydney at St. George Bank Ltd. “We remain
relatively bullish on the Australian dollar for fundamental
reasons, one of which is ongoing reasonably firm commodity
prices.”  Australia’s dollar traded at $1.0506 at 10:09 a.m. in
Sydney from $1.0508 on April 12, when it completed a 1.2 percent
weekly gain. It touched $1.0582 on April 11, the highest since
Jan. 11.  The currency’s three-month risk reversal was at minus
1.3425 after touching minus 1.3075 on April 12, the highest
since October 2009. The Aussie fetched 103.50 yen from 103.36.  The  New Zealand dollar , known as the kiwi, fell 0.2 percent
to 86.68 U.S. cents from the end of last week, when it posted a
1.9 percent five-day gain. It lost 0.1 percent to 84.41 yen.  Australia’s government bonds rose, pushing the 10-year
yield down five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 3.26
percent. The  MSCI World Index (MXWO)  declined 0.4 percent on April 12.  China GDP  China’s  gross domestic product  probably expanded 8 percent
in the three months ended March 31 from a year earlier, the
fastest growth since the first quarter last year, according to
the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
The figures are due for release today. China is Australia and
New Zealand’s biggest trading partner.  The RBA will tomorrow release minutes of the April 2
meeting when it left the cash rate at 3 percent.  Interest-rate
swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg show traders see a 32 percent
chance the central bank will lower its benchmark to 2.75 percent
at the next meeting on May 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
