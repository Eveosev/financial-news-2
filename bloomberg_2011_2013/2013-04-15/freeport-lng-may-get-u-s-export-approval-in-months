Freeport LNG Development LP may get
expanded approval from the U.S. Energy Department to export
liquefied natural gas in the next quarter or two, the head of
Baker Botts LLP’s LNG practice said.  The multibillion-dollar Texas project is next on the
department’s  list  of companies seeking permission to export gas
to nations that aren’t party to U.S. free-trade agreements.
Steven Miles, who has worked on more than 100 LNG transactions
and doesn’t represent closely held Freeport LNG, said he expects
the government to follow the list.  “The Department of Energy is being as diligent as they can
on this,” Miles, a partner in the firm’s Washington office,
said in an interview in Houston today. “There’s an awful lot of
work to be done in terms of processing these applications.”  A surge in North American production from shale formations
has led to proposals for about 30 billion cubic feet of daily
U.S. gas export capacity.  Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG)  owns the only
project in the lower-48 states that has all approvals for LNG
exports.  Freeport is “optimistic” that the project will receive
approval within the next two quarters, John Tobola, general
counsel for the Houston-based company, said in an interview.  Freeport, which has agreements with BP Plc, Osaka Gas Co.
and Chubu Electric Power Co. for use of the export facility, has
 said  it plans to begin construction on two production units this
year, with operations starting in 2017.  To contact the reporter on this story:
