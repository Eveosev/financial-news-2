Japanese  stocks  fell, with the
 Topix (TPX)  Index snapping its longest winning streak in two years,
after the U.S. said it would urge  Japan  to refrain from policies
to devalue the yen and Chinese economic data missed estimates.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , the Japanese automaker with the highest
proportion of exports, slid 3.2 percent.  Hitachi Construction
Machinery Co (6305) , a machinery maker that gets 17 percent of its
revenue in  China , fell 2.3 percent. Japan Steel Works Ltd., a
supplier of parts for nuclear  power plants , lost 5.4 percent
after the Nikkei newspaper reported workers will be forced to
take time off amid a drop in orders.  The Topix dropped 1.3 percent to close at 1,133.99 in
 Tokyo , ending an eight-day advance that was the longest such
streak since February 2011. More than two stocks slid for each
that gained today. The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  lost 1.6 percent
to 13,275.66, with volume 30 percent above the 30-day average.  “Profit-taking is dominating the market as it seems like
the yen won’t weaken beyond 100 per dollar soon,” said Koji Toda, chief  fund manager  at Resona Bank Ltd. in Tokyo, which
oversees about 15 trillion yen ($153 billion). “China’s data
are confirming the underlying concern about its economic
outlook.”  Beating Deflation  The Topix surged 57 percent from mid-November as the yen
fell amid pledges from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and  Bank of
Japan  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda to beat deflation. The gauge
traded at 17.1  times average estimated earnings , compared with
14.4 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.6 for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  14-day relative strength index  of the Topix has stayed
for four days above the 70 threshold that some traders say
signals shares have risen too much, too fast.  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  slid 0.3 percent. The measure
fell 0.3 percent on April 12, when government data showed retail
sales unexpectedly fell in March.  As G-20 finance ministers and central bankers prepare to
convene this week in  Washington , the  U.S. Treasury  said it will
press Japan to refrain from competitive devaluation of the yen
and European governments are urging it not to become too reliant
on fiscal and monetary stimulus.  The yen has rebounded after weakening to 99.95 per dollar
on April 11, the lowest since April 2009. It traded at 98.08 per
dollar today and gained against 15 of its 16 major counterparts.  Exporters dropped with Mazda slipping 3.2 percent to 304
yen.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a construction machinery maker that gets 80
percent of its revenue abroad, fell 2.9 percent to 2,433 yen.
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s biggest carmaker, declined 2.1
percent to 5,540 yen.  China’s Growth  China’s gross domestic product  grew  7.7 percent in the
three months ended March from a year earlier, the National
Bureau of Statistics said in Beijing today. That compares with
the 8 percent median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 41
analysts and 7.9 percent in the fourth quarter. Industrial
production gained less than estimated in March, while retail-
sales growth matched forecasts.  Companies that do business in China fell. Hitachi
Construction slid 2.3 percent to 2,194 yen.  TDK Corp. (6762) , a maker
of electronics components that depends on China for 27 percent
of its revenue, dropped 3.2 percent to 3,210 yen.  Japan Steel Works dropped 5.4 percent to 490 yen, the
biggest loss since Feb. 5, after the Nikkei reported the company
was cutting shifts. About 500 employees, or 70 percent of the
total at the firm’s plant on Japan’s northern island of
Hokkaido, have agreed to take about two work days off a month
for the half-year starting mid-April, spokesman Akito Aiuchi
said today.  Pioneer Jumps  Among stocks that gained,  Pioneer Corp. (6773)  rose 4.3 percent to
219 yen after the Nikkei said  Sharp Corp. (6753)  plans to sell its
entire stake in the audio equipment maker. Sharp, the
unprofitable TV maker, gained 10 percent to 370 yen.  Kansai Electric Power Co., the Japanese utility most
dependent on nuclear plants for power generation, jumped 16
percent to 1,369 yen on rising expectations for the restart of
the nation’s reactors after the Nuclear Regulatory Authority
announced new rules last week. The gain was the biggest since
Dec. 17.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  fell 2.5 percent
to 27.90, indicating traders expect a swing of about 8 percent
on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
