A case of Chateau Haut-Brion 2008,
a first-growth Bordeaux from Pessac-Leognan, sold for 3,100
pounds ($4,800) on the  London  Liv-ex wine exchange April 12, its
highest level in 10 months, according to Liv-ex data.  The vintage was fetching as little as 2,400 pounds a case
in January, its lowest price since February 2010, before
recovering on Liv-ex over the past two months. The advance,
while recouping 25 percent of the past two years’ decline, still
left the wine trading 40 percent below its Liv-ex peak of 5,190
pounds reached in June 2011.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index has risen 10 percent since
November, when it touched a 31-month low. A 0.3 percent gain in
March, following a 2.9 percent increase in February, was its
fourth straight advance. A rebound in Bordeaux first-growth
wines such as Haut-Brion after the selloff has lifted the index.  “I still believe Bordeaux will outperform Burgundy in the
short term,”  Miles Davis , partner in London-based Wine Asset
Managers LLP, with $20 million under management, said in a phone
interview. “It’s been good since November, very steady.”  Haut-Brion is one of the five left-bank first growths in
Bordeaux’s 1855 classification, and the 2008 wine is the
cheapest of its past four vintages. The estate, which has been
making wine for more than 400 years, was bought in 1935 by U.S.
financier Clarence Dillon and is still owned by his descendants.  1989 Vintage  Haut-Brion’s most expensive wine of the past quarter-
century remains its 1989 vintage, which was awarded a perfect
100-point score by U.S. wine critic  Robert Parker . One case sold
for 10,925 pounds at a Christie’s International Plc auction in
London on Feb. 21 while another fetched 10,810 pounds at a
Sotheby’s U.K. sale the same month.  Haut-Brion 2008 has still fallen more than any of the
estate’s previous nine vintages over the past 12 months,
according to merchant prices collated by Liv-ex, and the wine is
the third-biggest decliner by that measure in the Liv-ex Fine
Wine 50 over the past year, trailing only Chateau Mouton-
Rothschild 2008 and Chateau Lafite-Rothschild 2000.
