 Saudi Arabian Oil Co. started
producing crude from Manifa, the world’s fifth-largest oil
field, on April 10, three months ahead schedule.  Saudi Aramco , as the state-owned producer is known, said
today the field will produce 500,000 barrels a day of Arabian
heavy crude by July and it will reach 900,000 barrels a day by
end of next year.  Crude supply from the $17-billion Manifa project will help
the company to maintain its maximum production capacity of 12
million barrels day, without raising output beyond that level,
Aramco said in an e-mailed statement.  Manifa is the last of the so-called giant oil field
discoveries in  Saudi Arabia  to begin operations. Its output will
feed the Satorp refinery and two other facilities currently
under construction, Jazan and Yasref. The  International Energy
Agency  forecast in July that capacity in the kingdom, the
world’s biggest crude exporter, will fall this year before
rebounding in 2014 once Manifa starts production.  Aramco will invest more than $35 billion in exploration and
development in the next five years to keep its oil production
portfolio robust, Chief Executive Officer Khalid Al-Falih said
in a speech posted on the company’s website in September.  The Satorp refinery in Jubail, a joint venture with
 France ’s  Total SA (TOT) , will take its first crude next month, Chief
Executive Officer Christophe de Margerie said April 11 in Paris.
Yasref in Yanbu, which Aramco is building with   China Petroleum
& Chemical Corp. (386) , or Sinopec, and Jazan will each be able to
process 400,000 barrels a day of crude.  To contact the reporter on this story:
