Argentina  may get a U.S. Supreme
Court hearing in its legal battle with a hedge fund seeking to
collect $2.5 billion owed by the South American country on
defaulted bonds.  The justices today signaled interest in the case by asking
the Obama administration for advice on an appeal by Argentina.
The country’s multifaceted, decade-long clash with NML Capital
Ltd., an affiliate of billionaire  Paul Singer ’s Elliott
Management Corp., stems from Argentina’s 2001 default on $95
billion in bonds.  NML is seeking to enforce judgments it won in U.S. court
cases. Billionaire Kenneth Dart’s EM Ltd. is pressing similar
claims. Dart isn’t involved in the Supreme Court case.  The appeal seeks to block a court order requiring  Bank of
America Corp.  and state-owned Banco de la Nacion Argentina to
turn over information about Argentina’s assets.  Argentina contends that it is protected by the U.S. Foreign
Sovereign Immunities Act. The country says that law limits such
orders to assets that are in the U.S. and are used for a
commercial activity. The New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals rejected that argument.  The case is Argentina v. NML Capital, 12-842.  To contact the reporter on this story:
