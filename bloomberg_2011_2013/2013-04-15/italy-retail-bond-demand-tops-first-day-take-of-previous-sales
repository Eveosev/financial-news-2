Initial demand for an Italian
inflation-linked  bond  aimed at retail investors has already
topped the amount sold in the first day of the previous sale.  The Italian Treasury had received  orders  for 2.9 billion
euros ($3.79 billion) of the bonds by 11:06 a.m. in Rome
compared with 2.48 billion euros at the end of the first day of
the last sale of the securities in October. The order period
ends April 18, though the Treasury has said it may close the
sale earlier if demand is particularly strong.  The four-year bond carries a minimum coupon of 2.25
percent.  The Treasury last year began reaching out to Italians, who
are among the biggest savers in  Europe , as contagion from the
debt crisis triggered an exodus of foreign investors. Italy
plans to hold two of the retail bonds sales this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
