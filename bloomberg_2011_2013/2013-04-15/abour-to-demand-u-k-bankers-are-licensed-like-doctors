Britain’s opposition  Labour Party 
is seeking legislation to license bankers so that they are
subjected to similar checks as lawyers or doctors.  Labour will propose amendments to the Financial Service
(Banking Reform) Bill that will be debated in the House of
Commons in  London  later today. It will also press for greater
immunity for whistle-blowers who reveal bad behavior in the
industry, the creation of a Financial Crime Unit in the  Serious
Fraud Office , and greater protection for consumers who buy gift
vouchers when companies become insolvent.  “A proper licensing system would ensure that a higher
standard of qualification, training, competence -- and behavior
-- could be applied.”  Chris Leslie , who speaks for the party on
Treasury affairs, said in an e-mailed statement. “It would also
ensure that there could be proper sanctions imposed if licenses
are breached.”  Lawmakers have sought to strengthen the bill during its
passage through Parliament as they seek credit from voters for
creating a safer banking system. Last month, a parliamentary
commission scrutinizing the bill demanded for a second time that
Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  toughen the
legislation, which is intended to create firewalls between
bank’s retail and investment arms.  Labour is seeking to extend protection under the 1996
Employment Rights Act to workers who report a financial crime at
their workplace. The party said the money raised from the 25
percent increase in fines imposed on bankers since 2010 should
be used to fund the financial crime unit at the SFO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
