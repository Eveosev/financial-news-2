Supreme Court Justice  Samuel Alito  walked among tables named for Parisian streets at the Library of Congress Friday night.  The occasion was “A Moveable Feast: The Hemingway in Paris Ball,” a fundraiser for the  Washington  Ballet. The company presents the premiere of a work called “Hemingway: The Sun Also Rises” next month at the Kennedy Center.  Alito said he was a fan of dance “derivatively” through his wife, Martha-Ann, who accompanied him to the flapper party.  Chris Dodd , the former Connecticut senator and now chairman and chief executive of the  Motion Picture Association  of America, and his wife, Jackie Clegg, served as the event’s chairmen. Their daughter Christina recently performed in the company’s “Cinderella.”  Seated at Rue du Cherche Midi was Bruce Lipnick, the chairman of Asset Alliance Corp., whose daughter Olivia also dances with the company. Lipnick brought a group of  New York  finance executives, including Asset Alliance Managing Director Peter Kash, Glenn Myles, chairman and CEO of  First Wall Street Capital  Corp., and Bill Marcus, president of Evolution Trading Partners LLC.  After dinner, between trips to the crepes-and-ice-cream bar, guests danced under the library’s frescoed ceiling.  Performing Arts  Reginald Van Lee, an executive vice president and partner at Booz Allen Hamilton Inc., attended the Hemingway ball as well as Saturday night’s Washington  Performing Arts  Society Annual Gala & Auction at the Ritz Carlton.  It was a five-day sprint of parties for the ever-active Van Lee. How was he holding up? “Don’t ask,” he said with a grin.  The gala was headlined by “Glee” star Matthew Morrison and chaired by Ruth and  Arne Sorenson , the president and CEO of Marriott International. He suggested his Hong Kong property to those traveling to  Asia  because of the “bar on the 118th floor” with stunning views of the city.  Honorary chairman Irish Ambassador  Michael Collins , who will leave his post in Washington this summer for a new one in Berlin, caught up with German Ambassador Peter Ammon and Daniel O’Brien, chief of staff to Senator  Robert Menendez , the New Jersey Democrat.  Other guests included Trent Lott, former Senate majority leader and now the partner of  Breaux Lott Leadership Group .  Animal Abuse  “People who abuse animals will eventually abuse people,” said Congressman John Campbell, the California Republican, who along with Congressman Jim Moran, Virginia Democrat, received the 2013 Humane Hero Award from the  Washington Humane Society  Saturday night at its annual Fashion for Paws benefit.  The two animal lovers are both chairmen of the Congressional Animal Protection Caucus. They sat in the front row in the National Building Museum to watch volunteer models with dogs work the runway. The event, which has become a major draw among Washington’s young professionals, has pulled in almost $3 million dollars since its inception in 2007.
