Spot gasoline in the Gulf Coast
strengthened to the highest level against futures in six weeks
after a power failure shut units at refineries in the Port
Arthur,  Texas , area.  Motiva Enterprises LLC’s plant experienced flaring and
upsets at several units following yesterday’s interruption,
while  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  was restarting a crude unit and a
hydrocracker today, according to the companies. Total
Petrochemicals USA Inc.’s Port Arthur plant reported a fire as
well as unit upsets.  The discount for  conventional , 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB,
in the Gulf narrowed 5.5 cents to 15.5 cents a gallon versus
futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 3:58 p.m., the
strongest differential since Feb. 27, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Reformulated gasoline increased 3.75 cents to a premium of
3.75 cents a gallon, the biggest gain since September, while
conventional,  87-octane gasoline  strengthened 4.75 cents to a
discount of 11.5 cents a gallon.  Electricity provided by  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  was restored
yesterday to the Port Arthur refineries, which account for 1.08
million barrels a day of refining capacity on the Gulf Coast.
The cause of the failure will be under investigation in coming
days, said David Caplan, a company spokesman based near Houston.  The interruption may mean a drop in  Gulf Coast gasoline
supplies , which the Energy Information Administration said fell
77,000 barrels to 74.2 million in the week ended April 5.
Distillate inventories declined 632,000 barrels to 35.5  million 
barrels, said the Energy Department’s statistical arm.  Chicago Spread  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  fuel on the Gulf increased 0.5 cent
to 1.25 cents a gallon below Nymex futures.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf, a rough measure of
refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,
 Oklahoma , gained $2.15 to $24.72 a barrel, the highest level
since April 1. The same spread for Light Louisiana Sweet oil
increased $1.70 to $10.22 a barrel, the third consecutive daily
advance, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Refining margins  in  Chicago , based on WTI, rose $1.38 to
$26.47 a barrel. Gasoline in the region traded 5.44 cents above
the fuel on the Gulf Coast.  Conventional gasoline, or CBOB, in Chicago strengthened
2.25 cents to  10 cents a gallon  below Nymex futures after  Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM)  shut its 238,000-barrel-a-day Joliet, Illinois
refinery for planned maintenance.  The closing, which includes all of its operating units,
will last “several weeks,’ said Tricia Simpson, a company
spokeswoman based at the plant.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel in Chicago increased 0.25 cent to
trade at a premium of 8.5 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
