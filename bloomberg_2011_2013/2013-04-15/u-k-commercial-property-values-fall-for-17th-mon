U.K. commercial real estate values
fell for the 17th straight month in March, led by a drop in
retail properties, Investment Property Databank Ltd. said.  The average value of stores, offices and warehouses,
declined 0.2 percent from February, London-based IPD said in a
statement today. Total return, which combines changes in real
estate values and rental income, was 0.4 percent in March.  “We are still seeing subdued returns adversely affected by
negative capital movements outside of  London ” as prices
continue to fall there, Phil Tily, a managing director at IPD,
said in the statement. “Though the U.K. economy has managed to
avoid a triple-dip recession, it is nevertheless going to be a
long road to recovery for the commercial property sector.”  Britain’s economy will grow less than previously forecast
this year and further bond purchases by the  Bank of England  may
do little to stimulate the recovery, the London-based Ernst &
Young Item Club said today. That’s prompting businesses to delay
decisions on moving to new offices and warehouses and causing
consumers to spend less, hurting stores.  Retail values overall declined by 0.3 percent in March,
compared with 0.1 percent for offices and warehouses.  The IPD index was compiled from appraisals of 3,416
properties valued at 31.4 billion pounds ($48.3 billion) at the
end of March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
