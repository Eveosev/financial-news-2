The U.S. won dismissal of a lawsuit
brought by the Catholic group Priests for Life challenging a
federal mandate that health insurance provide coverage for birth
control.   A federal judge in New York ruled that the government is
still working on regulations and itâ€™s unclear what effect they
would have on the group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
