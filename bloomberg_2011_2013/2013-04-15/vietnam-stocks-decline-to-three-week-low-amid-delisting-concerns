Vietnam ’s  stocks  dropped, dragging
the benchmark index to its lowest level since March 19, amid
concern loss-making companies will delist their shares and after
foreign investors sold the nation’s shares last week.  The  VN Index (VNINDEX)  slumped 2.1 percent to 484.16 at the 11:30
a.m. local-time break in Ho Chi Minh City. Alphanam Investment
Joint-Stock Co. tumbled 6 percent as the company sought
shareholder approval to delist after posting a full-year net
loss. Overseas investors  sold  a net $8.08 million of shares in
the four days through April 12, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the longest selling streak since Oct. 4.  “The fact that foreign investors switched from net buying
to net selling makes domestic investors feel worried,” said
Nguyen Hoai Nam, deputy head of research at Maybank Kim Eng
Securities Joint-Stock Co., from Hanoi. “People are also
concerned that some companies with weak earning results may have
to delist.”  Masan Group Corp. (MSN)  fell 3.3 percent to 117,000 dong, headed
for a one-month low. The company will seek investor approval to
pay no 2012 dividend, according to a statement on its website.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
