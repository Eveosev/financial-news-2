Indebted euro-area countries should
implement wealth taxes as a way to generate funds to offset
future bailouts, an economic adviser to German  Chancellor Angela
Merkel  told  Der Spiegel  magazine.  Peter Bofinger , a member of the  German Council of Economic
Experts  that reports to the chancellery, said a wealth tax would
be an alternative to a deposit levy, according to an interview
with Spiegel published yesterday.  “The rich would for example have to give up a part of
their wealth over a 10-year period,” Bofinger told Spiegel. A
wealth tax would be more suitable than levying a charge on
deposits over 100,000 euros ($131,000), since such depositors
can move their accounts to banks in northern  Europe , he said.  The proposal comes amid a debate about wealth differences
among the 17 member states of the single currency following an
April 9 European Central Bank report that showed higher median
net wealth levels for indebted countries. Households in Cyprus,
the fifth and latest recipient of a euro bailout, are the second
richest in the monetary union, the figures showed.  The report justifies  Germany ’s “hard” stance with respect
to indebted nations, economist Lars Feld, another member of the
advisory board, told the magazine. Foremost is the ability for
such countries to raise the tax, he said.  “If there were tax laws that don’t exist only on paper,
even  Greece  would be able to remove doubt on the sustainability
of its debt,” Feld told Spiegel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
