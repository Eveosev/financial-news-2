David Cameron’s spokesman refused
to specify when the prime minister will be publish his tax
return, as the French government prepared some of the strictest
requirements in  Europe  for politicians.  French President Francois Hollande, stung by one of his
ministers admitting he’d hid an overseas bank account, will
require government ministers to divulge their assets and sources
of income today. Last April a spokeswoman for Cameron said he
was relaxed about the idea of the tax returns of senior Cabinet
Ministers being published, but wanted the opportunity to explore
how this might work.  When asked today by reporters whether Cameron would publish
details of his taxes, spokesman Jean-Christophe Gray declined to
name a date for such a disclosure.  “His position is that he will be relaxed about doing so,”
Gray said, when asked if Cameron would publish the document by
the time of the next election in 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
