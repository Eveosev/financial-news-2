Lehman Brothers Holding Inc.’s
Australian unit sought federal court approval for a creditors’
vote on a proposed claims settlement that will see them getting
less than half of what they are owed, a litigation funder said.  Creditors will be paid between 39.9 Australian cents and
49.2 cents for each dollar of debt in the local currency, IMF
(Australia) Ltd. said in a statement today. U.S. insurers agreed
to pay $45 million to fund the settlement, and IMF will drop a
class action lawsuit against the firm as part of the agreement,
outlined in an April 12 filing, according to the statement.  Lehman Brothers Australia appointed a voluntary
administrator under the country’s bankruptcy laws on Sept. 26,
2008, after Lehman Brothers Holdings, then the fourth-largest
investment bank in the world, filed for bankruptcy. The
securities firm had $613 billion in debt, making it the biggest
bankruptcy in U.S. history.  The Australian unit has assets of between A$297 million
($312 million) and A$303 million and creditors are owed between
A$596 million and A$654 million, according to the IMF statement.
IMF’s clients are owed A$143.5 million, it said.  PPB Advisory, liquidators of the Lehman unit, plan to ask
for approval of the meeting of creditors to vote on the proposed
settlement at a May 7 hearing, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
