Scott Reiman, the founder of
investment firm Hexagon Inc., agreed to pay almost $900,000 to
settle U.S. regulatory claims he made illegal trades based on
confidential information about a potential investment in Delta
Petroleum.  Reiman made about $398,000 in illegal profits after
obtaining inside information in 2007 that private investment
firm Tracinda planned a $684 million investment in Delta
Petroleum, the SEC said today in an administrative proceeding.  The SEC said Roger Parker, Delta Petroleum’s former chief
executive officer, tipped Reiman as well as another friend,
Michael Van Gilder.  “These enforcement actions against Reiman, Parker and Van
Gilder show that the SEC will unravel the story behind
suspicious trades and root out corporate insiders who give away
confidential information as well as those who can’t resist the
temptation to trade on it,” Sanjay Wadhwa, senior associate
director of the SEC’s regional office in  New York , said in a
statement.  Reiman agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or
director of a public company for at least five years.  Cliff Stricklin, Reiman’s attorney, said his client
“decided to use his energy in a positive way instead of getting
bogged down in a lengthy legal battle.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
