Henkel AG, the German maker of
Loctite glues and Persil detergent, said the economic situation
in the  euro zone  may worsen this year.  “We do not expect the euro zone to undergo any tangible
improvement in the current year,” Chief Executive Officer
Kasper Rorsted told shareholders at the annual general meeting
in Dusseldorf today. “Things are likely to get worse before
they get better.”  Emerging markets  will return to “robust”
growth during the year and there will be an “upturn” in  North
America , he predicted.  Emerging markets such as eastern Europe, Africa,  Latin
America  and Asia accounted for 43 percent of sales last year, up
from 42 percent in 2011. That helped reduce Henkel’s reliance on
western Europe, where government austerity measures to counter
the debt crisis deepened a recession.  Henkel reiterated its forecast for sales growth of 3
percent to 5 percent this year. The Dusseldorf-based company
sees adjusted return on sales rising to about 14.5 percent and
adjusted earnings per preferred share increasing by about 10
percent.  Henkel shares fell 0.8 percent to 72.50 euros at 10:33 a.m.
