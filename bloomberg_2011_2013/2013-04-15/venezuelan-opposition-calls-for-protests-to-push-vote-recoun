Venezuela ’s opposition is urging
supporters to bang pots and pans tonight in the first wave of
protests against alleged voting irregularities that it says
robbed Henrique Capriles Radonski of the presidency yesterday.  The opposition has asked the national electoral council to
block government plans to hold a presidential proclamation
ceremony this afternoon for Nicolas Maduro, Capriles told
reporters today in Caracas. The council yesterday declared
Maduro the winner of the April 14 election with 50.8 percent of
the vote.  Donning his trademark baseball cap that bears the colors of
the Venezuelan flag, Capriles urged supporters to stage peaceful
demonstrations nationwide to pressure election officials to
recount votes. While one member of the five-person electoral
council has said a recount will take place, the organization has
yet to make an official announcement. Capriles said he would
lead a procession to the council’s offices on April 17 if
demands aren’t met.  “I’ll grab a saucepan so I can hit it hard at eight
o’clock tonight so the voice of the people that expressed itself
yesterday can be heard,” said Capriles, 40. “Let it be heard
throughout the world.”  This afternoon’s proclamation will make Maduro an
illegitimate president, said Capriles, who according to the
election council took 49 percent of the vote yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
