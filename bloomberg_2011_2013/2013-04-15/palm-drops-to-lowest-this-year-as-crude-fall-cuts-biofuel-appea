Palm oil declined to the lowest
level this year after crude oil fell, reducing the appeal of
biofuels, as economic growth unexpectedly slowed in  China , the
world’s second-largest consumer.  The contract for June delivery lost 2.2 percent to 2,294
ringgit ($754) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives,
the lowest most-active price at close since Dec. 17. The
commodity, used in everything from biofuels to noodles, has
dropped 5.9 percent this year.  West Texas Intermediate fell below $90 a barrel for the
first time in more than a month after China’s National Bureau of
Statistics said gross domestic product in the first quarter rose
7.7 percent from a year earlier. That compares with the 8
percent median forecast in a Bloomberg survey and 7.9 percent in
the prior quarter. Commodities measured by the Standard & Poor’s
GSCI Index fell as much as 2.1 percent, the lowest since July,
as gold slumped to a two-year low.  “When crude oil declines, the demand for biofuels
suffers,” said Prathamesh Mallya, an analyst at AnandRathi
Commodities Ltd. in Mumbai.  Malaysia  left the export tax on crude palm oil unchanged at
4.5 percent for May, according to a Customs Department statement
today. Exports from Malaysia fell 4 percent to 648,275 tons in
the first 15 days of April from the same period in March,
Intertek said today.  Soybean oil for July delivery dropped 0.9 percent to 49
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for July
lost 0.5 percent to $13.7275 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for September delivery declined 2.5
percent to close at 6,168 yuan ($997) a ton on the Dalian
Commodity Exchange. Soybean oil for delivery in the same month
retreated 2.1 percent to end at 7,678  yuan  a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
