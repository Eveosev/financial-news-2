Koza Altin Isletmeleri AS (KOZAL)  headed
for its steepest slump on record on speculation the Turkish gold
miner’s earnings will be hit as a two-day slide in the precious
metal pushed it into  bear market  territory.  The  shares  tumbled 9.5 percent to 35.10 liras by 3:40 p.m.
in Istanbul, set for the biggest drop since it first sold shares
to the public in February 2010. About 2.6 million shares changed
hands, more than 4 1/2 times the stock’s three-month average
daily volume, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Gold for
immediate delivery fell 4.2 percent to $1,420.03 an ounce,
bringing its back-to-back loss to 9.4 percent. The precious
metal has lost 20 percent since it reached 1792.42 per ounce on
Oct. 4.  “Koza generates 99 percent of its revenues through sales
of extracted gold,” Bertan Ilbak, an analyst at Global
Securities in Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments today. “Gold
entered bear market territory just as Borsa Istanbul closed the
week on Friday. Thus, investor reaction was delayed to today.”  A security is said to be in a bear market if it corrects by
20 percent or more in a given period.  Koza operates four  gold mines  in  Turkey , with a fifth at
the development stage, according to the company’s website. It
reported 642.1 million liras ($369 million) of net income in
2012, up 39 percent from 460.5 million liras in the previous
year.  Gold’s slump may hurt second-quarter revenues, Ilbak, who
cut his recommendation for Koza to sell from hold on April 10,
said. He is the only analyst among 21 tracked by Bloomberg that
 recommends  investors sell Koza’s shares. Thirteen say buy and
seven prefer to hold.  Koza Altin trades at eight times its estimated 12-month
earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares
with a 6.3 multiple for South Africa’s  Harmony Gold Mining Co.
Ltd. (HAR) , 7.6 for Russia’s  Polymetal International Plc (POLY)  and 7.4 for
China’s  Zijin Mining Group Co. Ltd. (2899)   To contact the reporter on this story:
