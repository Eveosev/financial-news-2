John Malone’s  Liberty Global Inc. (LBTYA) 
won European Union approval to buy U.K. cable-television
provider  Virgin Media Inc. (VMED)  to challenge Rupert Murdoch in
Europe’s biggest pay-TV market.  The European Commission said in a statement that the deal
wouldn’t raise competition concerns “in particular because the
parties operate cable networks in different member states and
because of the merged entity’s limited market position in the
wholesale of TV channels in the U.K. and Ireland.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
