Sevan Marine ASA (SEVAN) , a developer of
floating oil and gas vessels that’s struggled with higher costs,
rose the most in three weeks in Oslo after the successful test
of its Voyageur Spirit unit moved it closer to being debt free.  Shares in the Arendal, Norway-based company climbed as much
as  2.8 percent , the most since March 27, and traded 2.3 percent
higher at 18.1 kroner as of 11 a.m. That extends the stock’s
gain to 25 percent during the last 12 months and gives Sevan a
market value of 947 million kroner ($165 million).  Sevan’s Voyageur Spirit floating production, storage and
offloading vessel has completed 72 hours of continuous
production testing at the North Sea’s Huntington field, the
company said in a statement on April 13. The so-called FPSO is
now expected to be transferred to Voyageur LLC, a unit of
 Teekay Corp. (TK) , within a week, Sevan said.  “Following this, Sevan will be debt-free with in excess of
$50 million in net cash,” Erik Toenne, an analyst at Sparebank
1 Markets AS, said in an e-mailed note to clients. The transfer
has “been perceived as a risk-item” by investors and as a
result Sevan “should react positively,” wrote Toenne, who has
a  buy recommendation  on the stock.  Sevan Marine agreed to sell the Voyageur, Piranema and
Hummingbird vessels, long with a 40 percent stake in the
company, to Teekay in October 2011 as part of its restructuring
to avoid bankruptcy after struggling with larger-than-expected
maintenance costs on its Voyageur unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
