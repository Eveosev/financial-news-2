Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard ’s government slipped further behind the opposition in an
opinion poll less than five months from an election, as voters
opposed a plan to curb tax concessions on retirement savings.  Support for the Labor government slid 2 percentage points
to 29 percent, the weakest since June 2012, compared with 49
percent for the Tony Abbott-led opposition, a Nielsen survey
published in Fairfax newspapers today showed. On a two-party
preferred basis, Abbott’s Liberal-National coalition led the
government 57 percent to 43 percent. Labor won 50.1 percent of
the vote at the 2010 election to form a minority government.  Gillard traveled to  China  last week for talks with the new
leadership of  Australia ’s biggest trading partner. Earlier in
the month, the government announced A$900 million ($950 million)
in savings over four years by cutting tax breaks for the wealthy
as it bids to plug a budget shortfall. Even as the government
said changes to taxation of pension savings impact just 16,000
individuals, the poll showed 52 percent of voters opposed them.  Abbott leads Gillard 50 percent to 42 percent as preferred
prime minister, the Nielsen poll showed. The prime minister in
January set an election for Sept. 14 and has struggled since
then, culminating in a ballot for the Labor leadership on March
21 that her predecessor,  Kevin Rudd , chose not to contest.  Rudd, who declared afterward that he would never challenge
for the leadership again, was preferred Labor leader with 57
percent of survey respondents, down from 62 percent in March,
today’s poll showed. Gillard’s support versus Rudd rose to 35
percent from 31 percent, it showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
