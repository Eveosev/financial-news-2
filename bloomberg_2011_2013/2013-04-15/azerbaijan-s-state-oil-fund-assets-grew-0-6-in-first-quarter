Azerbaijan’s State Oil Fund, known
as  Sofaz , expanded its assets 0.6 percent to $34.3 billion as of
April 1 from the end of last year.  Sofaz’s gold holdings have increased to 18.4 metric tons by
the end of the first quarter, according to an e-mailed statement
today from the fund, which was established in 1999 in Baku, the
Azeri capital, to manage the Caspian Sea nation’s income from
the sale of oil and natural gas.  The fund started investing in gold, as well as in the
Australian dollar, Russian ruble, Turkish lira and real estate
last year to diversify holdings. It plans to increase its gold
reserves to 30 tons by the end of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
