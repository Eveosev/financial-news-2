Copper reached a nine-month low in
 London  as commodities fell after economic growth was weaker than
estimated in  China , the world’s biggest consumer of raw
materials from industrial metals to soybeans.  The economy expanded at a 7.7 percent annual pace in the
first quarter, China’s statistics bureau said today, below the 8
percent rate predicted in a Bloomberg survey of analysts. The
Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of commodities declined for a
fourth session, led by gold, which entered a bear market last
week, and silver.  “Metal prices have become caught up in the downward pull
of precious metals,”  Daniel Briesemann , an analyst at
Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt , said by e-mail. “The downswing is
being further exacerbated by new economic data from China.”  Copper for delivery in three months declined 1.5 percent to
$7,293 a metric ton by 10:07 a.m. on the London Metal Exchange.
Prices reached $7,273, the lowest since June 22. Copper for
delivery in May slid 1.9 percent to $3.288 a pound on the Comex
in New York. Aluminum, nickel, tin, zinc and lead touched this
year’s lowest levels in London.  The International Monetary Fund last week cut its forecast
for U.S. growth this year and billionaire investor  George Soros 
said Germany will probably be in a recession by the end of
September. The countries are the second- and third-ranking
copper consumers. Sweden lowered its 2014 growth estimate today
and inflation reached a 40-month low in  India .  Still, money managers reduced their net-short position, or
bets on lower copper prices, by 16 percent to 32,850 Comex
futures and options contracts in the week ended April 9 from the
prior period, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission figures
showed.  Copper stockpiles monitored by the LME gained 3 percent to
611,175 tons, remaining at the highest since September 2003.
Inventories in Johor,  Malaysia , expanded by 19,600 tons and are
up sevenfold this year.  Tin for delivery in three months fell 1.8 percent to
$21,600 a ton on the LME. The metal dropped below its 200-day
moving average at about $21,655.  To contact the reporter on this story:
