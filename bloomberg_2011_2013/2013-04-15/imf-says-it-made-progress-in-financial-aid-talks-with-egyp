The International Monetary Fund said today that it “made progress in the discussions with the Egyptian authorities on their economic program and possible financial support from the IMF” and that talks will continue.  “The authorities have already taken valuable first steps to improve the targeting of energy subsidies and are seeking to broaden their revenue base,” the IMF said in a statement in  Washington . “They intend to build on these steps with further actions to address, in a socially balanced way, the country’s fiscal and balance of payments deficits, and create conditions for a sustained recovery of the economy.”  The IMF, which issued its statement at today’s conclusion of a staff mission to  Egypt , did not say when talks would resume.  “Discussions with the authorities will continue with the objective of reaching agreement on a possible Stand-By Arrangement in support of Egypt,” the IMF said.
