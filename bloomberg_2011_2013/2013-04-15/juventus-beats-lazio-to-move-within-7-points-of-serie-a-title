Juventus beat Lazio 2-0 to pull 11
points clear atop Serie A with six games remaining as it seeks a
record-extending 29th Italian league soccer championship.  Arturo Vidal  scored both goals in the victory in  Rome 
last night. The Chilean midfielder converted an eighth-minute
penalty kick before doubling the lead 20 minutes later with a
close-range finish.  Juventus moved to 74 points through 32 of 38 games and
needs seven points from its remaining matches to guarantee the
title because of its superior head-to-head record against
second-place Napoli, which can finish with a maximum 81 points.  “We’ve taken another step forward and we’re drawing even
closer to our target,” Juventus coach  Antonio Conte  said in
comments on his team’s website. “We still need seven points to
be mathematically certain, so we won’t talk about it until it’s
in the bag, Instead we’ll continue to push on.”  Juventus next hosts third-place AC Milan in the late game
on April 21, after Napoli plays Cagliari.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
