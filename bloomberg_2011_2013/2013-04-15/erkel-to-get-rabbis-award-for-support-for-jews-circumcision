German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
will be awarded the Lord Jakobovits Prize for European Jewry for
support of the German Jewish community and her stance against
anti-Semitism in Europe.  Merkel was also recognized for backing religious
circumcision, the Conference of European Rabbis said today in a
 statement . Merkel will receive the prize at the Great Synagogue
of Europe in Brussels on May 22, the group said.  “ Chancellor Merkel  is a worthy recipient, in recognition
of her continuing efforts of inter-communal harmony across
Europe, her friendship towards the Jewish community and
outstanding contributions to the promotion of tolerance and
understanding,” Pinchas Goldschmidt, the president of the
conference, said in the statement.  Germany’s parliament last year approved a law allowing male
circumcision under medical supervision, responding to an outcry
by Jewish and Muslim groups after a court ruled the procedure
amounted to bodily harm. Merkel had warned that  Germany  risked
being branded a “nation of buffoons” if it became the only
country to prohibit the practice, Bild newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
