Corn declined after posting the
biggest weekly gain in six as rain in parts of the U.S., the
world’s largest grower, may replenish soil moisture needed for
planting after drought cut last year’s harvest.  Corn for July delivery lost as much as 1 percent to $6.35 a
bushel, ending last week’s 2 percent rally for the most-active
contract, the biggest since the five days ended March 1. Futures
were at $6.3625 by 10:33 a.m. in  Singapore  on volume that was 83
percent higher than the 100-day average for that time.  Snow and rain last week helped provide moisture in the
driest areas of  Iowa ,  Nebraska , southern  Minnesota  and South
Dakota, Joel Burgio, an agricultural meteorologist at DTN, wrote
in a report April 12. Farmers in the U.S. will probably plant
97.3 million acres of corn, the most since 1936, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said March 28. The harvest totaled
273.8 million metric tons in the year that began Sept. 1, the
smallest since 2006-2007, the USDA said April 10.  “It’s just profit-taking” that’s pushing prices lower,
Tetsu Emori, a commodity fund manager at Astmax Asset Management
Inc. in  Tokyo , said by phone today. “People should be focusing
on weather conditions.”  Wheat for July delivery slipped 0.7 percent to $7.1475 a
bushel, while soybeans fell 0.3 percent to $13.755 a bushel.  Soybean crushing by 12 companies in the Washington-based
National Oilseed Processors Association, or NOPA, probably fell
2.1 percent to 137.645 million bushels in March from a year
earlier, based on the average estimate of eight analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. NOPA, which represents processors with 62
plants in 19 states, is due to release its estimates today.  In  China , imports will probably fall to 58 million tons in
the year beginning Oct. 1, from an estimated 59.2 million tons
this year, according to a separate Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
