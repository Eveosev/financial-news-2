China ’s  stocks  fell, dragging the
 Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP)  Index down by 10 percent from its February
high, as data on the nation’s economic growth and industrial
production missed estimates.  Construction machinery maker  Zoomlion Heavy Industry
Science and Technology Co.  slumped to a 15-month low after
forecasting lower profit.  Cosco Shipping Co. (600428) , a unit of China’s
biggest shipping company, lost 3.9 percent after reporting a
loss. Zijin Mining Group Co. sank 5.6 percent, leading gold
producers lower, after the metal’s futures dropped by the 5
percent daily exchange limit in  Shanghai .  The Shanghai Composite fell 1.1 percent to 2,181.94 at the
close, its lowest level since Dec. 24. The economy grew 7.7 in
the first quarter from a year earlier, the National Bureau of
Statistics said today, less than the 8 percent median forecast
in a survey of 41 economists. Industrial production rose 8.9
percent in March, the report showed. That compared with the 10.1
percent median economist forecast.  “These figures are pretty bad,” said Dai Ming, a  fund
manager  at Hengsheng Hongding Asset Management Co. in Shanghai,
which manages $190 million. “The current stock prices haven’t
fully reflected lower-than-expected economic data and the market
has room for further declines.”  The CSI 300 Index retreated 1 percent to 2,436.82. The  Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies traded in  Hong
Kong  slid 1.8 percent. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the
measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, fell
0.5 percent in  New York  yesterday.  Economic Data  The Shanghai index has fallen 10 percent from a Feb. 6 high
amid concern steps to cool  property  prices will drag on economic
growth. Valuations on the gauge dropped to 8.9 times projected
12-month earnings on April 12, the lowest level since Dec. 13
and less than the seven-year average of 15.8,  data  compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Fixed-asset investment excluding rural households grew 20.9
percent in the January-to-March period from a year earlier, the
statistics bureau reported. That compared with the 21.3 percent
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey and a 21.2 percent gain in
the first two months of 2013.  Retail sales  in March rose 12.6
percent from a year earlier, meeting estimates.  Premier  Li Keqiang  said the nation should pay attention to
the quality and efficiency of development as it seeks to
guarantee “reasonable” economic growth, China National Radio
reported yesterday.  Zoomlion, China’s second-biggest maker of construction
equipment, slumped 5.5 percent to 7.63  yuan  after estimating
first-quarter profit will fall between 60 percent and 80
percent. The stock closed at the lowest level since Jan. 6,
2012.  Gold Tumbles  Cosco Shipping fell 3.9 percent to 3.49 yuan, the lowest
close since Dec. 6. The company reported a first-quarter loss of
45.1 million yuan, ($7.29 million), compared with a profit of
3.8 million yuan a year earlier.  Zijin Mining, China’s largest gold producer, dropped 5.6
percent to 3.20 yuan.  Zhongjin Gold Co. (600489) , the third biggest,
slumped 6.7 percent to 12.93 yuan. Bullion for June delivery on
the Shanghai Futures Exchange slumped by the 5 percent daily
exchange limit. Spot gold fell 6.2 percent to $1,483 an ounce
last week, the biggest drop since December 2011.  Trading volumes in the Shanghai composite were 30 percent
lower than the 30-day today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Ten-day  volatility  on the gauge was at 7.9, near the
lowest level since January 2008, the data showed.  The iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund, the largest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., fell 0.7 percent to $36 on
April 12, rising 1 percent for the week.  Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP) , whose main unit was forced into
bankruptcy after defaulting on a $541 million bond repayment
last month, jumped 80 percent to 75 cents, the steepest weekly
advance on record. While the solar-cell maker had the biggest
gain on the Bloomberg China-US gauge for the week, it is still
down 60 percent from this year’s high reached Jan. 16.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
