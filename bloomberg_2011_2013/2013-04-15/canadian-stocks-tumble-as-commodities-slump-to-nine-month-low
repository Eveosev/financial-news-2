Canadian  stocks  fell a third day as
commodities slumped to the lowest in nine months after economic
growth unexpectedly slowed in  China .  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the largest producer of gold, and
Goldcorp Inc. tumbled more than 5.5 percent as the metal sank
below $1,400 an ounce.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ)  lost 3.5
percent as crude slipped to its lowest this year. Suncor Energy
Inc. fell 2.8 percent after agreeing to sell most of its natural
gas assets for C$1 billion.  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) , Canada’s
largest diversified miner, sank 7.9 percent.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 188.86
points, or 1.5 percent, to 12,148.73 at 9:47 a.m. in Toronto,
headed for the lowest level in four months. The benchmark
Canadian equity gauge is down 2.3 percent this year.  China’s economy unexpectedly lost momentum in the first
quarter, expanding 7.7 percent from a year earlier, the National
Bureau of Statistics said. That compares with the 8 percent
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey and 7.9 percent in
the prior quarter.  The  S&P GSCI index  of 24 raw materials plunged as much as
2.1 percent to its lowest level since July 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
