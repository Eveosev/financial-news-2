China’s  yuan  rose to a 19-year high
after the central bank set a record fixing against the dollar,
before paring gains as the government reported an unexpected
slowdown in economic growth.  The People’s Bank of China raised its daily  reference rate
 by 0.08 percent to 6.2454 per dollar. The yuan is allowed to
trade as much as 1 percent either side of the fixing. GDP
increased 7.7 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier,
official data showed today, less than 7.9 percent in the
preceding three months and lower than the 8 percent median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  The yuan gained 0.08 percent to 6.1871 per dollar in
 Shanghai , prices from the  China  Foreign Exchange Trade System
show. It touched 6.1860 earlier, the strongest level since the
government unified official and market exchange rates at the end
of 1993. The currency has rallied in each of the last seven
weeks, adding 0.7 percent in the longest winning streak since
November.  “With growth looking OK but not great, there’s little
incentive for China to accelerate the pace of yuan
appreciation,” said Sim Moh Siong, a currency strategist at
Bank of Singapore Ltd. “This signals bearish tones for other
markets, including high-beta currencies like the Aussie and
commodities.”  Industrial production rose 8.9 percent in March, less than
the 10.1 percent forecast in a Bloomberg survey, according to
another report today. Retail sales advanced 12.6 percent, the
same as projected in a separate survey.  Manufacturing, Services  Chinese  manufacturing  grew in March at the fastest pace in
11 months and services output also expanded, according to
purchasing managers’ indexes published this month. China will
keep the yuan “basically” stable, the central bank said on its
 website  on April 3.  In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the Chinese currency was
steady at 6.1860 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.02 percent to
6.2565, a 1.1 percent discount to the spot rate in Shanghai.  One-month implied volatility in the onshore yuan, a measure
of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
declined four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 1.37
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
