Peruvian bonds rose, pushing yields
down the most in a month, after the economy expanded less than
economists forecast in February, spurring speculation the
central bank may lower  interest rates .  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol bond
due in August 2020 declined three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 3.70 percent at 1:57 p.m. in  Lima ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The drop was the
biggest on a closing basis since March 15. The price climbed
0.20 centimo to 126.16 centimos per sol.  Economic activity rose 5 percent in February from a year
earlier after a 6.2 percent increase in January, the national
statistics agency reported today. The median forecast of 12
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 5.9 percent.  Growth was “well below the market’s expectations” and may
strengthen the argument for a rate cut if inflation continues to
ease, said Diego Llona, a bond trader at the local unit of Banco
Santander SA.  The Andean nation’s central bank kept its overnight rate
unchanged for a 23rd consecutive month on April 11, citing
stable growth and slowing inflation.  Commodities dropped today after economic growth in  China 
missed analysts’ estimates. The Asian nation was Peru’s second-
largest export market last year after the U.S.  The sol slid 0.1 percent to 2.59 per dollar at the close,
according to prices from Datatec. The central bank purchased $10
million of U.S. currency today, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
