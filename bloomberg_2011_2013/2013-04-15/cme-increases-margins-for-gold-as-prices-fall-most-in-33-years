CME Group Inc. (CME)  increased the margin
requirements on gold trading after prices plunged.  The minimum cash deposit for gold futures will rise 19
percent to $7,040 per 100-ounce contract at the close of trading
tomorrow, Chicago-based CME said in a  statement . For silver, the
minimum cash deposit was raised to $12,375 from $10,450.  The CME’s Comex unit is making it more expensive for
speculators to trade after gold fell the most in 33 years today,
dropping to the lowest since February 2011, after prices entered
a  bear market  last week. Silver, also in a bear market, slumped
11 percent today and extended the year’s loss to 23 percent.  “A huge collapse of this kind usually sees CME raising
margins to minimize volatility and lower speculation,”  Michael Smith , the president of T&K Futures & Options Inc. in  Port St.
Lucie , Florida, said in a telephone interview.  Gold futures for June delivery slumped 9.3 percent to
settle at $1,361.10 in New York, the biggest drop for a most-
active contract since March 17, 1980. Prices reached $1,335.10
in after-hours electronic trading, the lowest since Feb. 3,
2011.  Estimated trading on all gold contracts was 702,957
contracts today, topping the previous record of 486,315
contracts reached on Nov. 28.  The metal’s three-month implied volatility, a gauge for
future price swings, touched 51.09, the highest since September
2011.  CME also raised margins for platinum and palladium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
