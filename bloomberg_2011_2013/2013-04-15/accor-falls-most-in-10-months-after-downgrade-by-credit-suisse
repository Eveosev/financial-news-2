Accor SA (AC) ,  Europe ’s largest hotel
operator, dropped the most in 10 months in Paris trading after
Credit Suisse Group AG downgraded the stock and said first-
quarter results may fall short of the bank’s expectations.  Accor fell as much as 5.5 percent to 25.26 euros, the
biggest decline  since  June 11. The company may report
disappointing first-quarter sales on April 17 on falling revenue
per available room and weaker like-for-like profit, Credit
Suisse said in an e-mailed note today. It cut Accor to
underperform from outperform.  Accor in February announced a plan to widen margins and cut
costs by scaling back the number of properties it owns. While
the disposals may result in a cash return, falling revpar, a
measure of occupancy and rates, in  France , the U.K. and the rest
of Europe is likely to result in a repeat of weaker sales during
the second half.  “We see an increasing risk of disappointment for Accor,”
Credit Suisse said. “The asset-driven restructuring story
should still drive a re-rating by 2016, with scope for a 1
billion-euro cash return, but this is insufficient to offset the
increased trading risks and we downgrade to underperform.”  The stock was down 4.9 percent at 25.44 euros as of 11:23
a.m. Accor has gained 3.3 percent in the last 12 months, giving
the company a market value of 5.78 billion euros ($7.6 billion.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
