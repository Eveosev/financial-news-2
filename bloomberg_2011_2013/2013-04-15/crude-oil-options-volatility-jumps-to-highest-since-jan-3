Crude options volatility jumped to
the highest level since Jan. 3 as the underlying futures slid to
the lowest settlement this year.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 26.03 percent at 2:45 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , up from 20.63 percent on April 12.  West Texas Intermediate crude for June delivery sank
$2.58, or 2.8 percent, to settle at $89.03 a barrel on the
Nymex. Prices have declined 6.3 percent in three days of losses.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
May $85 puts, which advanced 16 cents to 20 cents a barrel on
volume of 12,063 contracts at 2:49 p.m. June $80 puts were the
second-most active, rising 34 cents to 50 cents on volume of
7,541 contracts.  Puts accounted for 72 percent of electronic trading volume
today. Bearish bets made up 63 percent of April 12â€™s volume of
228,312 contracts.  May $88 puts were the most active options traded in the
previous session, with 13,834 contracts changing hands. They
rose 13 cents to 17 cents a barrel. May $90 puts increased 34
cents to 46 cents a barrel on 13,512 lots.  Open interest was highest for May $85 puts with 38,916
contracts. Next were June $80 puts with 38,029 and December $105
calls at 36,121.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
