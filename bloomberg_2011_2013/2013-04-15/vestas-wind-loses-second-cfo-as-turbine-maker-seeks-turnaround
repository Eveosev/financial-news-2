Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the Danish
turbine maker seeking a turnaround, said Dag Gunnar Andresen
resigned, the second chief financial officer to quit in less
than 18 months.  Andresen will leave for personal reasons by the end of the
month, the Aarhus-based company said today in a statement. He
will be replaced by Marika Fredriksson from May 1.  Andresen’s departure less than a year into the job comes
after his predecessor Henrik Norremark quit in February last
year following a full-year loss amid price pressures in the wind
turbine market.  “There is no change in the strategy focus and turnaround
of the company,” Morten Albaek, a company spokesman, said by
phone following Andresen’s departure. “He wanted to stop for
personal reasons. We regret that he has to leave.”  Vestas, which is halfway through a two-year push to cut its
workforce by about 30 percent to 16,000, aims to sell factories
to reduce costs and align production capacity with market
demand.  Fredriksson has “extensive” experience with 15 years at
companies including Gambro AB and Volvo Construction Equipment
Corp, Vestas said. She played a part in “turnaround
processes,” management changes and mergers and acquisitions,
according to the company.  Vestas was down 2.3 percent at 46.77 kroner as of 1:10 p.m.
in Copenhagen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
