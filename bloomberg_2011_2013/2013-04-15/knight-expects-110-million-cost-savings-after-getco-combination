Merging  Knight Capital Group Inc. (KCG) 
and Getco LLC will generate savings of much as $110 million a
year through cost reductions.  The elimination of redundancies in infrastructure and
personnel will help cut expenses by $20 million to $30 million
during the first year of the merger, according to a statement
from Knight. Annual savings will increase to $90 million to $110
million by the third year, the company said.  The shares will be listed on the New York Stock Exchanger
under a revised plan where existing  stockholders  can exchange
three shares for one share of the combined company. The original
agreement was one for one. The change, which doesn’t affect the
total paid to  Knight Capital ’s shareholders, is aimed to meet
NYSE’s requirement for a minimum share price of $4 at the time
of listing, the companies said. Knight Capital closed at $3.74
on April 12.  Knight Capital agreed in December to be purchased by Getco
in a $1.4 billion deal, ending its 17 years of independence.
Getco, a closely held high-frequency trading company, was among
six financial firms that bailed out Knight Capital in August,
after trading glitches caused more than $450 million in losses
and brought the company to the brink of bankruptcy.  Knight Capital said in February that it will reduce its
workforce by 5 percent as it combines sales teams and
discontinues its clearing business.  -Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
