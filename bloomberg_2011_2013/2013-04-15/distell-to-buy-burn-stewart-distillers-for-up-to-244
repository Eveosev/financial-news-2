Distell Group Ltd. (DST) , South Africa’s
biggest wine and spirit producer, plans to acquire Scotch whisky
producer Burn Stewart Distillers Ltd. for as much as 2.2 billion
rand ($244 million).  The company entered into a binding agreement with CL World
Brands Ltd. and  Angostura Ltd. (AHL)  for Burns Stewart, which owns
three malt whisky distilleries, Stellenbosch-based Distell said
in a statement today. Distell will make an initial payment of
$229 million, net of assumed liabilities, and a contingent
payment of as much as $15 million.  Scotch whisky exports increased 87 percent to 4.3 billion
pounds ($6.6 billion) in the past decade, Distell said, citing
the Scotch Whisky Association. Single malt exports gained 190
percent to 778 million pounds in the same period.  “The acquisition of Burns Stewart provides Distell access
to this highly attractive growing category,” the company said.
“Burn Stewart’s strong presence in the U.K., Taiwan and other
countries provides Distell with enhanced sales platforms and
route-to-market opportunities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
