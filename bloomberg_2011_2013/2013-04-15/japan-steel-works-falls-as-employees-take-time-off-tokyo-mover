Japan Steel Works Ltd ., a nuclear
parts supplier for customers including Areva SA, fell the most
in two months in Tokyo trading after the Nikkei reported that
workers at a plant will take time off as orders decline.  Shares slumped 5.6 percent to 489 yen as at 1:13 p.m. local
time, set for the biggest drop since Feb. 5. Japan Steel Works
was the biggest  decliner  among stocks listed on the Nikkei 225
Stock Average.  About 500 workers, or 70 percent of the total workforce at
the Muroran plant on Japan’s northern island of Hokkaido, have
accepted a proposal by the company to take about two days off a
month for the six months starting mid April, spokesman Akito
Aiuchi said today by telephone, confirming the Nikkei
newspaper’s  report  on April 13.  “The company’s nuclear business in Japan will be tough for
a while,” Masayuki Otani, a Tokyo-based strategist at
Securities Japan Inc., said by phone.  Japan Steel operates the only plant in the world capable of
producing the central part of a nuclear reactor’s containment
vessel in a single piece, reducing the risk of a radiation leak.
The Tokyo-based company has removed aged facilities and
relocated some of its workers at the Muroran plant since the
Fukushima disaster, President Ikuo Sato said March 13 in an
interview.  A decision on whether to extend the time off plan beyond
October will be made later by monitoring demand, Aiuchi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
