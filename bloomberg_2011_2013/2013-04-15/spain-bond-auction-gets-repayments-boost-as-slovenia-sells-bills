Spain ’s auction of three-, five-
and 10-year bonds this week will probably be absorbed by the
nation’s banks, boosted by repayments of existing government
debt, according to Sunrise Brokers LLP.  Slovenia will attempt to sell bills on Wednesday after its
government failed to raise 100 million euros ($131 million) at a
debt sale last week.  France  and  Germany  are also scheduled to
hold bond auctions this week.  Italy  is selling securities to
retail investors.  Spain, where 10-year  yields  are within 10 basis points of a
more than two-year low, has bond maturities and coupon payments
of 19 billion euros to pay by the end of the month, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It sold about 41 billion euros of
medium- and long-term debt last quarter, completing a third of
its annual funding needs, as the market weathered political
turmoil in Italy and a banking  crisis in Cyprus .  “Spanish supply has always been very well supported by
domestics and this should be the case again,” said Gianluca Ziglio, executive director of fixed-income research at Sunrise
in  London . “We have very large coupon and redemption payments
this month, which should be quite supportive for Spanish bonds.
If issuance becomes heavier than scheduled and there are fewer
redemptions later in the year, that’s when the situation can get
worse.”  Outstanding Debt  Spain will have to pay almost 63 billion euros for maturing
securities and interest through the end of this year, according
to the data compiled by Bloomberg. Spanish banks’ share of the
nation’s sovereign bonds fell to 31.6 percent in February, from
34.3 percent the month before, according to data released on the
Treasury’s website on March 26.  Ten-year yields were at 4.71 percent at 7:57 a.m. London
time, after dropping to 4.61 percent on April 11, the least
since November 2010. The last time Spain sold the 5.4 percent
2023 bonds, on March 21, it agreed to a yield of 4.898 percent,
the lowest yield for an auction of 10-year securities since
November 2010.  With bond yields approaching levels that prompted bailouts
of other euro nations, the Slovenian government is planning to
sell 18-month Treasury bills on April 17. The  International
Monetary Fund  estimates Slovenia will need to borrow about 3
billion euros this year to repay maturing debt, aid banks and
finance the budget.  Germany will sell an additional 4 billion euros of bunds
maturing in February 2023 on April 17. It last sold 10-year debt
at auction at an average yield of 1.36 percent on March 20, the
second-lowest on record, according to the Bundesbank.  France will sell as much as 8 billion euros of bonds
maturing in November 2015 and May 2018 on April 18. It will also
auction inflation-linked securities the same day.  Euro-area governments and the European Financial Stability
Facility sold about 32 billion euros of bonds and notes last
week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
