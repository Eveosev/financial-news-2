Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM)  and Zijin
Mining Group Co. led declines among gold producers amid concern
a decline in the precious metal to its lowest level since April
2011 is weakening the earnings outlook for producers.  Newcrest,  Australia ’s largest gold producer, declined 8.1
percent to A$17.955 at 12:40 p.m. in Sydney, bringing this
year’s drop to  19 percent  and heading for its lowest close since
October 2008. Zijin Mining Group Co.,  China ’s biggest gold miner
by market value, sank 7.2 percent to HK$2.33 in  Hong Kong ,
extending its 2013 retreat to 24 percent. Newcrest was the
sixth-biggest drag on the  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP) , the regional
equities benchmark gauge that fell 0.8 percent.  Gold for immediate delivery dropped as much as 3.9 percent
$1,425.75 an ounce and was at $1,433.15 at 10:09 a.m. in
 Singapore . The price of the precious metal slumped 5 percent on
April 12, taking losses to more than 20 percent since a record
close in 2011, and meeting the common definition of a  bear
market .  “The investment community has barely begun to liquidate
their holdings,” of gold-related assets, said Stewart Richardson, who helps oversee $100 million as partner and chief
investment officer at RMG Wealth Management LLP in  London . “We
will be standing on the sidelines to see how this shakeout
progresses.”  The turn in the gold cycle is quickening and investors
should sell the metal, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts said in
an April 10 recommendation.  Bullion has plunged 11 percent in 2013, after rising for 12
straight years, as data showed the global economy is improving,
prompting investors to sell holdings in exchange-traded products
at a record pace.  Other gold producers retreated. Jiangxi Copper Co. fell 4.4
percent to HK$15.74.  Kingsgate Consolidated Ltd. (KCN)  lost 16 percent
to A$2.94,  Northern Star Resources Ltd. (NST)  plunged 15 percent to
75.5 Australian cents and Alacer Gold Corp. tumbled 14 percent
to A$2.99.  To contact the reporter on this story:
