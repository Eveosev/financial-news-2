India’s one-year interest-rate
swaps slid to the lowest in more than two years on speculation
softening inflation will spur the central bank to cut borrowing
costs for a third time this year.  Gains in benchmark  wholesale  prices slowed to 6.27 percent
in March, the smallest increase in 40 months, according to a
Bloomberg News survey before data due today. The Reserve Bank of
India has lowered its benchmark repurchase  rate  by 50 basis
points to 7.5 percent in two reductions this year. The next
policy review is due May 3.  The one-year swap, a derivative contract used to guard
against fluctuations in funding costs, fell two basis points to
7.36 percent as of 9:25 a.m., data compiled by Bloomberg show.
That’s the lowest level since March 15, 2011.  “The drop in short-end swaps reflects increased rate cut
expectations,” said Nagaraj Kulkarni, a Singapore-based
strategist at Standard Chartered Plc. “The recent drop in
global crude-oil prices also supports such expectations.”  Brent crude has retreated 17 percent from this year’s high
of $118.90 a barrel touched in February. India imports about 80
percent of its oil. Consumer  prices  rose 10.39 percent in March,
compared with 10.91 percent in February, official data showed on
April 12.  The yield on the 8.15 percent government bonds due June
2022 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.85
percent, according to the central bank’s trading system.  To contact the reporters on this story:
