South Korea , the world’s fifth-
largest oil importer, reduced crude shipments from  Iran  by about
17 percent in March from a year earlier, customs data show.  Purchases last month were 556,658 metric tons, compared
with 668,706 tons a year earlier, according to data on the  Korea
Customs Service ’s website today. The volume was 550,827 tons in
February, the figures showed. The March deliveries were
equivalent to about 132,000 barrels a day.  South  Korea  halted imports of Iranian crude in August and
September after the start of a European Union ban on insurance
coverage for tankers carrying oil from the Persian Gulf nation.
The injunction was a part of sanctions by Western countries
intended to pressure the Islamic republic to stop its nuclear
program, which the U.S. and  Israel  say is aimed at developing
atomic weapons and Iran says is for civilian purposes.  South Korea resumed crude shipments from Iran in October
after the Persian Gulf nation offered its own vessels for
transporting the commodity.  Imports from the Islamic republic fell 22 percent to 1.92
million tons in the first three months of this year from 2.46
million a year earlier, according to the customs data. The
January-March imports were the equivalent of about 6 percent of
Korea’s total crude purchases of 31.42 million tons during the
three months, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
