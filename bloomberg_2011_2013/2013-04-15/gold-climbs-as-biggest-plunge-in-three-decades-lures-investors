Gold climbed for the first time in
three days on speculation the biggest slump in three decades may
lure investors to the precious metal. Silver rallied from the
lowest since October 2010.  Gold for immediate delivery gained as much as 1.5 percent
to $1,367.55 an ounce and was at $1,351.15 by 7:37 a.m. in
 Singapore . Prices plunged 9.1 percent yesterday, the biggest
decline since Feb. 28, 1983. Gold touched $1,335.75 yesterday,
the lowest since February 2011, after slipping into a  bear
market  on April 12.  Bullion has dropped 19 percent in 2013, after rising for 12
years, as data showed the U.S. recovery was gaining momentum and
the  Federal Reserve  signaled that U.S. monetary stimulus may be
scaled back this year. CME Group Inc. raised the amount that
speculators must keep on deposit for an initial account in gold
futures to $7,040 per contract from $5,940. Silver, platinum and
palladium margins were also increased.  “Gold prices remain under immense pressure,” Barclays Plc
analysts  Suki Cooper  and Christopher Louney, wrote in a report
dated yesterday. “Although there has been a physical demand
response to lower prices, it has not been sufficient to combat
the decline.”  Bullion for June delivery dropped as much as 1 percent to
$1,347.30 an ounce on the Comex in  New York  and traded at $1,351.
Spot silver rose as much as 1.2 percent to $23.03 an ounce after
slumping 0.7 percent to $22.5925, the lowest since October 2010.  Palladium gained 0.5 percent to $656.75 an ounce after
declining 0.4 percent to $650.70, the lowest since November.
Platinum rose 0.5 percent to $1,410 an ounce.  To contact the reporter for this story:
