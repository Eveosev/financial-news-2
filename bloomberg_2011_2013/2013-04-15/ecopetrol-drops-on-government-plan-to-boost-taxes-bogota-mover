(Corrects type of tax in first paragraph.)  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) , Colombia’s state-
controlled oil company, dropped to a three-month low as the
government announced that oil companies will pay a higher
withholding tax than that paid by agricultural and industrial
businesses and as global crude prices fell.  Ecopetrol, the most heavily weighted stock on Colombia’s
Colcap index, slid 3.5 percent to 4,295 pesos as of 12:22 p.m.
in Bogota, set for the lowest price on a closing basis since
Jan. 3. The shares have fallen 21 percent this year.  Commodity producers led global declines in emerging markets
today after economic growth in China, the world’s biggest
consumer of metals and energy, missed analysts’ estimates.
Ecopetrol dropped further after the Colombian government
announced the tax increases.  “The chatter from the ministers combined with a poor
global environment for the oil sector is creating a perfect
storm of pessimism,”  Rupert Stebbings , the head of equity sales
at brokerage  Bancolombia SA (BCOLO) , said in an e-mail.  Brent crude  fell to its lowest level in nine months and
West Texas Intermediate dropped below $90 a barrel after China
reported the economy expanded 7.7 percent in the first quarter.
That compares with the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of
41 analysts for an 8 percent gain in gross domestic product.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE) , the operator of Colombia’s
largest oil field, fell 2.3 percent to 36,760 pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
