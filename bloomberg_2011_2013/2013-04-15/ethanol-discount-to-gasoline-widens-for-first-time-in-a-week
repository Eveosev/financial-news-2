Ethanol weakened against gasoline
for the first time in a week as corn fell on speculation that
improved forecasts for planting weather will boost supplies.  The  spread , or price difference, widened 1.11 cents to
39.09 cents a gallon, snapping ethanol’s four days of gains
against the motor fuel. Corn for May delivery fell 1 percent to
$6.5175 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade at 8:41 a.m.
local time. Declining temperatures later this week probably
won’t make it cold enough to damage most crops, Commodity
Weather Group said today in a report.  “It’s a little bit of the corn market being under
pressure,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at INTL FCStone in
 Des Moines ,  Iowa . “A better weather forecast for planting
season is pressuring corn, and that’s spilling over into
ethanol.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery fell 3.5 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $2.387 a gallon in Chicago. Prices have gained 9
percent this year.  Gasoline for May delivery slid 2.39 cents, or 0.9 percent,
to $2.7779 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The
contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with
ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
