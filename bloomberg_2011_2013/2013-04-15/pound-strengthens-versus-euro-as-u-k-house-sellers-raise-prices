U.K.  government bonds  advanced for
a third day as a report showing  China ’s economic growth
unexpectedly slowed in the first quarter boosted demand for
haven assets.  Ten-year gilt yields approached the  lowest level  since
September even as the Debt Management Office prepared to sell
2.25 billion pounds ($3.45 billion) of 30-year bonds on
Thursday. The U.K. government will release inflation figures for
March tomorrow and the  Bank of England  is scheduled to publish
the minutes of its April 3-4 meeting the following day. The
pound weakened for a second day against the dollar.  “The Chinese numbers surprised on the downside and that’s
led to a bit of a correction on risk markets, giving support to
core government bonds including gilts,” said  Nick Stamenkovic ,
a strategist at broker RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh.
“The main driver for gilts this week is going to be the
inflation figures” and the central-bank minutes, he said.  The benchmark 10-year gilt  yield  declined two basis points,
or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.71 percent at 4:38 p.m.  London 
time after falling to 1.63 percent on April 8, the lowest since
Sept. 5. The 1.75 percent bond due September 2022 rose 0.13, or
1.30 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 100.33.  Chinese  gross domestic product  rose 7.7 percent from a year
earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said in Beijing
today. That compares with the 8 percent median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey, and 7.9 percent in the fourth quarter.  Inflation Rate  The U.K. annual  inflation  rate held at 2.8 percent in
March, according to a Bloomberg News survey before the  Office
for National Statistics  releases the data tomorrow. The rate
dropped to 2.2 percent in September, the lowest level since
November 2009.  Inflation expectations  dropped for a third day, with the
10-year break-even rate, derived from the yield difference
between gilts and index-linked securities, falling two basis
points to 3.26 percentage points. The rate climbed to 3.39
percentage points on April 11, the most since September 2008.  U.K. home sellers raised asking prices in April for a
fourth month amid a shortage of properties for sale, property-
website operator Rightmove Plc said in a report today.  Pound Drops  The pound dropped 0.2 percent to $1.5312 and was little
changed at 85.46 pence per euro.  “We’ve had some housing data that wasn’t particularly
terrible,” said  Paul Bednarczyk , a currency strategist in
London at 4Cast Ltd., a research company that counts central
banks among its subscribers. “The numbers are looking better
now and it looks like they will resist the triple-dip recession.
I’m cautiously optimistic on sterling at the moment.”  Sterling dropped 4.5 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. The euro advanced 1.2 percent and
dollar gained 2.1 percent.  Gilts returned 1.2 percent this year through April 12
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds gained
0.7 percent and Treasuries rose 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
