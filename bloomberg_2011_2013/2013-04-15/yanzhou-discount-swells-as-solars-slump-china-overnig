Chinese equities  slid the most in
10 months in  New York  after the Asian nation posted first-
quarter growth below economists’ forecasts, driving the Shanghai
Composite Index down 10 percent from a February high.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S. tumbled 3.3 percent to 87.02
yesterday, the biggest decline since June 21.  Yanzhou Coal
Mining Co. (YZC) ,  China ’s fourth-largest producer of the fuel, plunged
7.4 percent to trade at the biggest discount to its  Hong Kong 
stock since October after power-station coal prices fell to the
lowest level since 2009.  Home Inns & Hotels Management Inc. (HMIN)  fell
the most in 18 months and  Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP)  plunged 23
percent.  China’s  gross domestic product  rose 7.7 percent in the
first three months of this year, according to government data
released yesterday, below the 8 percent median of 41 economists’
forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. The economy emerged from a
seven-quarter slowdown in the fourth quarter, expanding 7.9
percent. The Shanghai Composite gauge of domestic Chinese shares
dropped to the lowest level since Dec. 24.  “It’s disappointing,” Mark Luschini, the chief investment
strategist at Janey Montgomery Scott LLC, which manages $55
billion in assets including Chinese equities, said by e-mail
from Philadelphia. “While most countries would be elated with
7.7%, it is a setback from 7.9% in the fourth quarter.” The
data is “not good for Chinese or emerging market stocks, or
commodities,” he said.  ETF Plunges  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., dropped 3 percent to $34.92 in
New York, losing the most since June. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index slid 2.3 percent to 1,552.36, the biggest slump in five
months.  Stocks extended losses after two explosions at the finish
line area of the Boston Marathon.  Yanzhou’s American depositary receipts plunged to $11.13 in
New York, the lowest since May 2009. Its ADRs traded 3.8 percent
below Hong Kong-traded stock, the biggest discount since Oct.
26. Each ADR stands for 10 underlying shares in the Shandong-
based company.  China’s benchmark price for thermal coal fell from a week
earlier to 605 yuan ($97.8) to 620  yuan  a metric ton, data from
the China Coal Transport and Distribution Association showed
yesterday. That was the lowest price since October 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Stockpiles of coal,
which fuels about two-thirds of the China’s power, rose to 7.19
million metric tons at the Qinhuangdao port.  Power output in China increased 2.1 percent to 419.4
billion kilowatt-hours last month, data from the National Bureau
of Statistics showed yesterday. That’s the smallest gain since
September, excluding February, when output fell 13.7 percent as
factories shut the Lunar New Year holiday.  Price Pressure  Home Inns, the biggest budget hotel chain operator in
China, sank 8.9 percent to $24.77, the biggest slide since
September 2011. The Shanghai-based company is scheduled to
report first-quarter results on May 13 after U.S. market closes.  “Most budget hotel vendors released some low-price
promotions in the first quarter, which could elevate occupancy
rate in the weak season but give pressure to the ADRs,” Tian X. Hou, the founder of T.H. Capital LLC, which does researches on
U.S.-traded Chinese equities, said in a note yesterday.  China’s industrial output in March rose 8.9 percent, the
National Statistics Bureau said yesterday. That compared with
the median estimate of 10.1 percent in a Bloomberg survey.
Chinese lenders issued 1.06 trillion yuan ($171 billion) of new
loans in March, exceeding the 900 billion-yuan median of
economists’ projections compiled by Bloomberg before the central
bank’s report April 11.  ‘Very Bad’  “It’s very bad that China’s credit expansion failed to
fuel an acceleration of economic activity,”  Michael Shaoul , the
chairman of Marketfield Asset Management LLC in New York, which
oversees more than $6 billion, said by e-mail.  Phoenix New Media Ltd. (FENG) , a Beijing-based Internet, TV and
mobile-news provider, lost 6.5 percent to $3.75, the biggest
decline since August. Trading volume on its ADRs was more than
twice the daily overage over the past three months, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  China Petroleum and Chemical Corp.,  Asia ’s biggest oil
refiner known as Sinopec, slid 4.5 percent to $108.35, the
lowest level since Dec. 4. Jefferies Hong Kong Ltd. analyst cut
the  rating  on Sinopec to an equivalent of sell yesterday from
hold. The 12-month price target was also slashed to $7.25 from
$8. A 2.3 percent  discount  in the ADRs to its Hong Kong shares
was the widest in two months.  Suntech Tumbles  Suntech Power, whose main unit was forced into bankruptcy
after defaulting on a $541 million bond repayment last month,
plunged to 58 cents in New York, sinking the most since March
21.  Thirty-day volatility  on the stock surged to 213 yesterday,
the highest level since January 2009, and compared with a three-
month average of 128, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  LDK Solar Co. fell 8.2 percent to $1.12, while Yingli Green
Energy Holding Co. dropped 7.1 percent to $1.97.  Trina Solar
Ltd. (TSL)  retreated 7.6 percent to $3.87 in New York.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  in Hong Kong sank 2
percent to 10,440.76, falling the most in a week, while the

a third day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
