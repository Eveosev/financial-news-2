Commodities tumbled to the lowest
level since July, led by precious metals and crude oil, after
economic growth in  China , the world’s biggest consumer of metals
and energy, missed analysts’ estimates.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24  raw materials 
declined as much as 1.8 percent to 611.86, the lowest level
since July 12, and was at 612.43 at 1:25 p.m. in Singapore. Oil
fell below $90 a barrel for the first time in more than a month
and gold extended its drop to the lowest since April 2011.
Silver slumped to the cheapest in more than two years and copper
reached an eight-month low.  China’s economy  unexpectedly lost momentum in the first
quarter, expanding 7.7 percent from a year earlier, the National
Bureau of Statistics said. That compares with the 8 percent
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey and 7.9 percent in
the prior quarter. Industrial output rose 8.9 percent in March
from a year ago, slower than an estimate of 10.1 percent.  Crude’s “decline is due to the bad GDP number out of
China,” said  Ken Hasegawa  an energy-trading manager at Newedge
Group in  Tokyo . “It was worse than expected.”  To contact the reporter for this story:
