Jim Rogers, the investor who
foresaw the start of a commodity rally in 1999, said he is
“extremely optimistic” about investing in water amid a
scarcity of supply in countries from  India  to the U.S.  “If you can find ways to invest in water, you will be
extremely rich because we do have a serious water problem in
many parts of the world like India,  China , the southwestern part
of the U.S., and west of the Red Sea,” Rogers, chairman of
Rogers Holdings, told reporters at his home in  Singapore  today.  The world’s growing food demand will create a progressive
shortage in supplies, according to the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization. Water used in farming will rise 70 to
90 percent through 2050 as food demand doubles over the same
period in emerging countries, Pasquale Steduto, principal
officer of the FAO’s water development and management unit, said
in March.  “There are some companies out there that clean and
transport water,” Rogers said, adding that he has owned shares
in Singapore’s water-treatment company,  Hyflux Ltd. (HYF) , for a few
years. “Find one with good management and invest in it and
you’ll be rich.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
