The New York Knicks clinched the
No. 2 playoff seed in the National Basketball Association’s
Eastern Conference with a 90-80 victory over the Indiana Pacers.  Carmelo Anthony scored 25 points over three quarters to
lead the Knicks yesterday at Madison Square Garden in New York,
where he sat out the fourth quarter as a precaution after
injuring his left shoulder. Chris Copeland added 20 points for
the Knicks, who have won 15 of their past 16 games to improve to
53-27 with two regular-season games left.  “That’s big for us,” Anthony told reporters. “We wanted
to lock that second seed up. We wanted to do it here on our home
court. We know Indiana is a tough team.”  Anthony, the NBA’s leading scorer, said afterward that his
injury, described as a shoulder bruise, isn’t serious.  “I just got nicked,” Anthony said. “I’m good.”  With the No. 2 seed, the Knicks will play Boston in the
opening round of the playoffs after winning three of four games
between the teams during the regular season.  The Pacers (49-31) secured the No. 3 seed in the East as
the Brooklyn Nets (47-33) were beaten yesterday by the Toronto
Raptors 93-87.  The Miami Heat are the No. 1 seed in the East and improved
to 64-16 with yesterday’s 105-93 win over the Chicago Bulls.  To contact the reporter on this story:
