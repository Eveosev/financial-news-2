Bank Indonesia  hasn’t decided on
the proposed acquisition of PT Bank Danamon Indonesia by  DBS
Group Holdings Ltd. (DBS) , the central bank said today, denying a
report the deal had been approved.  The Wall Street Journal reported on April 13 that Southeast
Asia’s largest lender got approval to buy as much as 40 percent
of Danamon and will be allowed to build a majority stake later
if it meets corporate governance and financial health standards.
No decision has been made, Bank Indonesia spokesman Difi Johansyah said in a text message today.  DBS is seeking to acquire 99 percent of Danamon for 66.4
trillion rupiah ($6.8 billion), including the equivalent of 45.2
trillion rupiah to be paid to Temasek Holdings Pte,  Singapore ’s
state-owned investment company, for its 67.4 percent stake.  The sale, announced a year ago, has stalled as Indonesia’s
central bank considers approval while seeking greater access for
its own lenders in Singapore. The acquisition would help DBS
gain access to more profitable lending opportunities and a
faster-growing economy.  Karen Ngui , a Singapore-based spokeswoman for DBS, declined
to comment when contacted on April 13. She didn’t answer a call
to her mobile phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
