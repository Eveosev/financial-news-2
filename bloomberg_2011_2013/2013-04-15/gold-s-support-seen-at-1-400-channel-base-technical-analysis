Gold, which entered a bear market
last week, may find support at the base of a descending channel
at about $1,400 an ounce, according to Barclays Plc.  “The market has broken down from a multi-year range base
and this indicates that pressure is likely to remain to the
downside,” said Dhiren Sarin, chief technical strategist for
Asia Pacific. More-immediate support is between $1,420 and
$1,435, where moving averages including the 200-week version
coincide, and there’s also support at $1,400, Sarin said.  A descending channel is a pattern in which the price of an
asset or level of an index shows lower highs and lower lows over
time, while support denotes clusters of buy orders. In technical
analysis, investors and analysts study charts to try to predict
changes in a security, commodity, currency or index.  Gold dropped into a bear market last week as investors cut
holdings on expectations an economic recovery is under way. The
turn in the cycle is quickening and investors should sell the
metal, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in an April 10 note.  Gold for June delivery slumped to $1,422.20 an ounce on the
Comex in New York, the cheapest since April 2011, and was at
$1,451.40 at 3:09 p.m. in  Singapore . Implied volatility for so-
called at-the-money options expiring in one month reached 21.62
percent today, from 17.3 percent on April 12 and 13 percent on
April 11, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Volatility has picked up,” Sarin said. “We expect moves
to be erratic but would look to sell rallies in the coming
sessions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
