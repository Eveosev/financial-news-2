Gluskin Sheff + Associates Inc. (GS) 
said it has concluded a review on ways to maximize  shareholder
value  for the Toronto-based  money manager , following a report
that the company may be for sale.  “The founders, the board and management have concluded
that the current platform remains an excellent way to serve
clients and enhance shareholder value at this time,” the firm
said today in a statement.  Gluskin Sheff hired bankers for a possible sale and buyers
have submitted bids, the Globe and Mail reported earlier today.
Suitors may include Canada’s largest banks, another money
manager or private-equity firms, the newspaper said. The company
said it did undertake “a process to explore shareholder value
maximization alternatives” at the request of its founding
shareholders.  “The company will only comment further on this matter if
and when appropriate,” the firm said in its statement. David
Morris, chief financial officer for Gluskin Sheff, didn’t
immediately return calls seeking comment.  Gluskin Sheff was founded in 1984 by Ira Gluskin and Gerald Sheff to serve wealthy clients and institutional investors,
according to the company website. The firm now offers equity,
fixed income and alternative investment strategies.  The stock has surged 27 percent this year, outperforming
the 2.5 percent decline for  Canada ’s benchmark Standard &
Poor’s/TSX Composite Index. Trading in the stock was halted
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
