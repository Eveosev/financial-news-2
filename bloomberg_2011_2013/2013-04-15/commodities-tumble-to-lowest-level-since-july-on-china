Commodities tumbled to the lowest
level since July, led by precious metals, crude oil and wheat,
after economic growth in  China , the world’s biggest consumer of
metals and energy, missed analysts’ estimates.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24  raw materials 
dropped 2.3 percent to 608.83, the lowest settlement since July
10. West Texas Intermediate oil fell below $88 a barrel for the
first time this year and gold fell the most since 1980. Silver
reached the lowest level in more than two years. Grains also
declined.  China’s economy  unexpectedly lost momentum in the first
quarter, expanding 7.7 percent from a year earlier, the National
Bureau of Statistics said. That compares with the 8 percent
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey and 7.9 percent in the
prior quarter. Reports bolstered speculation that growth in the
U.S, the world’s biggest economy, is slowing.  “The China situation is clearly the main reason behind the
drop in commodity prices,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at
Again Capital LLC, a New York energy hedge fund. “Some of the
recent economic data here hasn’t been good either. The Empire
State Manufacturing Index today and the retail sales numbers on
Friday both point to lower demand.”  Manufacturing in the New York region expanded less than
projected in April as orders cooled and sales stagnated, another
report today showed. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s
Empire State Manufacturing Index declined to 3.1 this month from
9.2 in March. Commerce Department data on April 12 showed that
retail  sales  fell 0.4 percent last month, the most since June.  Crude Prices  WTI crude oil for May delivery declined $2.58, or 2.8
percent, to $88.71 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
the lowest settlement since Dec. 24. The contract dropped as
much as 3.8 percent to $87.86 during trading.  Brent oil for May settlement fell $2.72, or 2.7 percent, to
end the session at $100.39 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. It was the lowest settlement since July
11. The European benchmark touched $100.02 during trading.  The weak economic data from China “affect potential demand
at a time of ample supply,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity
strategy at Saxo Bank A/S in Copenhagen. “It raises the
question whether we are going to see a buildup in spare
capacity.”  China’s  industrial output  in March rose 8.9 percent,
today’s report showed. That compares with the median estimate of
10.1 percent in a Bloomberg survey and a 9.9 percent pace in the
first two months combined.  Precious Metals  Gold futures for June delivery dropped 9.3 percent to
settle at $1,361.10 an ounce on the Comex in  New York , the
biggest drop since March 17, 1980. Silver futures for May
delivery plunged 11 percent to $23.361 an ounce in New York, the
lowest closing price since Oct. 22, 2010.  Copper for delivery in May slid 2.3 percent to $3.273 a
pound on the Comex, the lowest settlement since Dec. 15, 2011.  Soybean futures for July delivery declined 1.7 percent to
settle at $13.56 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Corn
futures for July delivery dropped 2.1 percent to end the session
at $6.28 a bushel. Wheat futures for July delivery slid 2.8
percent to $6.9925 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
