Kenya ’s shilling rose to the
highest in almost eight months against the dollar on subdued
demand for the U.S. currency and increasing foreign investment
in the East African nation.  The currency of the region’s biggest economy advanced as
much as 0.3 percent to 83.79 per dollar, the strongest since
Aug. 30 according to data compiled by Bloomberg, before trading
little changed at 84 by 3:10 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi.  “There is very low demand for dollars and we are seeing
quite a bit of foreign investment flows due to an increased risk
appetite for Kenya,” Chris Muiga, a senior dealer at Kenya
Commercial Bank Ltd. in Nairobi, said by phone.  Kenya’s stock market, the second-best performer in the
world this year, has rallied 32 percent in dollar terms. The
gauge climbed 13 percent since a March 4 presidential election
that was won by Uhuru Kenyatta.  Uganda’s currency strengthened 0.4 percent to 2,525 per
dollar, while Tanzania’s shilling fell 0.5 percent to 1,624.  To contact the reporter on this story:
