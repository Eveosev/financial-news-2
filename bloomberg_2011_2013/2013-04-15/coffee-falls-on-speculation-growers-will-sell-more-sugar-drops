Arabica coffee fell for a second
day in New York on speculation growers will boost sales to use
up inventories before new crops arrive. Sugar declined.  Brazil , the world’s largest producer, will start harvesting
its new crop by July and supply is still coming out from last
year’s record harvest. Exports were 2.23 million bags in March
and 2.2 million bags in February, industry data show. Prices
have dropped 5.4 percent this year as inventories in warehouses
monitored by ICE Futures U.S. expanded 7.2 percent to 2.76
million bags as of April 12.  “Local producer selling, given substantial inventories
unsold, could further weigh on New York trading levels,”  Edward Morse , global head of commodities research at Citigroup Inc. in
New York, said in a report dated April 12. “Aggregate coffee
supply-demand balances do still indicate healthy 2012-13
availabilities.”  Arabica for July delivery dropped 0.7 percent to $1.362 a
pound by 7 a.m. on ICE in New York. Robusta futures declined 0.9
percent to $2,051 a metric ton (93 cents a pound).  Raw sugar dropped 0.7 percent to 17.71 cents a pound and
cocoa declined 0.3 percent to $2,262 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
