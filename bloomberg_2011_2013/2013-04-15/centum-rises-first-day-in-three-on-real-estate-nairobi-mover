Centum Investment Co.,  Kenya ’s
largest publicly traded investment group, rose for the first
time in three days on speculation the company will benefit from
real-estate investments.  The stock climbed 1.2 percent to close at 21.50 shillings
in the capital, Nairobi, with about 1.7 times the three-month
daily average of securities changing hands.  The company is putting $22 million into the first phase of
Pearl Marina, a luxury real-estate project in  Uganda , Graeme
Reid, managing director of its Athena Properties Ltd. unit, said
in an interview on April 12. In Kenya, Centum will invest about
2 billion shillings ($24 million) in its Two Rivers project in
Nairobi, Chief Executive Officer James Mworia said in November.  “The company has gone into real estate and that is
something that appeals to investors and they have taken note,”
Ian Gachichio, a research analyst at Nairobi-based Kestrel
Capital ( East Africa ) Ltd., said by phone.  Net income in the six months through September was 805.6
million shillings compared with 793.2 million shillings a year
earlier, Centum said Nov. 13. The company is yet to provide a
date when it will announce full-year earnings.  “The general sentiment is that earnings for the financial
year ended March were good,” said Gachichio.  Shares in the company that invests in banks, breweries and
 food processing  have surged 74 percent since the start of the
year, the fifth-best performing Kenyan stock, outpacing the 28
percent gain on the Nairobi Securities Exchange All-Share Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
