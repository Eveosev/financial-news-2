Tunisia reached a deal with the
 International Monetary Fund  for a $1.78 billion loan, a
government official said, as the North African nation struggles
with its post-uprising transition.  A formal announcement of the agreement will be made on
April 16 and a deal will be signed by the end of May, the
official said in an interview. He spoke on the condition of
anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to brief the media.  An IMF team arrived in the country on April 8 for talks on
the loan, which Tunisian officials have said is key to help deal
with the economic aftershocks of the uprising that pushed
President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali from power in 2011.  The assassination of an opposition leader in February,
coupled with the  European debt crisis , and a lack of foreign
investments have undercut stability efforts.  The government expects the economy to expand 4 percent this
year compared with 3.6 percent in 2012, Tunisian Finance
Minister Elyes Fakhfakh said in an April 1 interview. The  budget
deficit  may widen to 5.9 percent of gross domestic product from
5.1 percent as spending is boosted to help create jobs in the
country’s interior.  To contact the reporter on this story:
