Hungary’s 10-year government bonds
rallied for a third day on speculation that slowing inflation
will help the central bank deepen rate cuts beyond a record low.  The ruling Fidesz party will discuss further energy price
cuts this year after a 10 percent reduction imposed on suppliers
from the start of the year, parliamentary leader Antal Rogan
said in an M1 television interview late yesterday. The  consumer
price index  rose 2.2 percent in March, the least since 1974,
because of the energy price changes, the statistics office said
on April 11.  “The market is pricing in further rate cuts because of the
better-than-expected inflation data,” Imre Kerekgyarto, a
Budapest-based trader at Commerzbank AG, wrote in an e-mail
today. “Combined with an already high capital inflow into
 emerging markets , the resulting rally in bonds is helping the
forint.”  Yields on 10-year bonds slipped two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to an eight-year low of 5.686 percent at 11:40
a.m. in Budapest. The forint rose 0.2 percent to 294.92 per
euro, a fourth day of advances and extending this month’s gain
to 3.1 percent, the best performance among more than 100
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank, which cut rates in eight
consecutive 25 basis point steps to 5 percent last month, will
continue a “cautious” and “conservative” policy, Ferenc
Gerhardt, a Monetary Council member nominated to become a
central bank vice president, told a parliamentary hearing today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
