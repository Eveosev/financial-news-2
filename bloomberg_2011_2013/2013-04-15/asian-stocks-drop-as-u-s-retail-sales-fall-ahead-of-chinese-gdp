Asian  stocks  dropped, with the
regional benchmark index retreating from the highest level in 20
months, after Chinese economic growth and industrial production
expanded less than economists’ estimated.  Jiangxi Copper Co.,  China ’s largest copper producer, slid
4.9 percent in  Hong Kong .  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , a Japanese carmaker
that gets 32 percent of sales from  North America , slid 3.9
percent, pacing declines among exporters after U.S. retail sales
unexpectedly fell. Mando Corp. tumbled 15 percent in Seoul as
Midas International Asset Management Ltd. said it will sell its
holdings after the auto-parts maker said it will bail out an
unprofitable construction affiliate.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.7 percent to 137.22 as
of 8:25 p.m. in  Tokyo , with about three shares sliding for each
that rose. Chinese gross domestic product expanded 7.7 percent
in the first quarter, missing economists estimates, data
released today showed.  “While the medium-term outlook is OK, people are having to
digest the fact that some of this short-term news flow isn’t
quite as good,”  Angus Gluskie , managing director at Sydney-
based White Funds Management, which oversees more than $350
million, said before the release of the Chinese data. “There’s
no doubt China’s growth over the next five or six years is going
to be at a more mature pace than it was over the last decade. We
should be expecting lesser rates of growth.”  The Asia-Pacific gauge jumped 3.5 percent last week, the
biggest weekly gain since September, as the yen traded near 100
per dollar and slower-than-estimated inflation in China eased
concern about monetary-policy tightening. Shares on the gauge
traded at 13.9 times estimated earnings compared with 14.4 for
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.6 times for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China Slowdown  China’s  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  dropped 1.1 percent. The
nation’s first-quarter economic growth was slower than the 8
percent median growth estimate of 41 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg and the 7.9 percent expansion in the previous three
months, a report by the National Bureau Statistics showed.  Industrial production rose 8.9 percent in March from a year
earlier, the report showed. That compared with the 10.1 percent
median forecast of 37 economists and a 9.9 percent gain in the
first two months of the year.  Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  slipped 1.4 percent, dragged
lower by banks and raw-material producers. South Korea’s Kospi
index slid 0.2 percent and Taiwan’s Taiex Index fell 0.7
percent.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index dropped 0.9 percent and
New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index added 0.4 percent, the only benchmark
measure in the Asia Pacific to rise outside  India .  Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 1.6 percent after
China’s data and as the U.S. Treasury department said it would
urge Japan to refrain from pursuing policies to devalue its
currency. The nation’s economy has shown signs of picking up,
 Bank of Japan  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said today in Tokyo.  Commodities Slide  S&P 500  futures  fell 0.5 percent. The gauge lost 0.3
percent on April 12 after the U.S. retail sales report and as
commodities plunged and a gauge of consumer sentiment slipped.  Raw material producers and energy companies posted the
biggest decline among the 10  industries  in the  MSCI Asia Pacific
Index. (MXAP)  Copper and crude oil futures retreated amid concern that
demand will slide after the unexpected slowdown in China’s GDP
growth.  Jiangxi Copper sank 4.9 percent to HK$15.66 in Hong Kong.
 BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s biggest mining company that gets,
dropped 3.1 percent to A$32.31 in Sydney. Cnooc Ltd., China’s
largest offshore oil producer, declined 3.1 percent to HK$13.74.  Gold producers tumbled as bullion extended losses after
plunging into a  bear market  last week. Newcrest Mining Ltd.,
Australia’s largest gold producer, slumped 8.2 percent to
A$17.92. Zijin Mining Group Co. sank 7.2 percent to HK$2.33 in
Hong Kong.  Nissan, Toyota  Exporters dropped after U.S. retail sales and a gauge of
consumer sentiment missed forecasts. Nissan slid 3.9 percent to
1,011 yen in Tokyo. Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s largest
carmaker, fell 2.1 percent to 5,540 yen.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a
supplier of toys and clothes to retailers including Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. dropped 2.3 percent to HK$10.28 in Hong Kong.  Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science and Technology Co. , China’s
second-biggest maker of construction equipment, slumped 8.3
percent to HK$7.61. The cranemaker is heading for the lowest
close since September 2011, after forecasting first-quarter
profit will fall between 60 percent and 80 percent.  Singapore Press Holdings Ltd. (SPH) , the city’s biggest newspaper
publisher, slipped 5.7 percent to S$4.34, heading for its
biggest decline since December 2011, after second-quarter profit
dropped 15 percent from a year earlier to S$71.5 million ($58
million).  Mando tumbled 15 percent to 84,600 won in Seoul, the most
on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index, after saying it will bail out
 Halla (014790)  Engineering & Construction Corp. Both companies are headed
by Chairman Chung Mong Won and Halla Engineering is the biggest
shareholder of Mando. Halla dropped 3.2 percent.  “We will sell off all of the company’s shares,” said Heo Pil Seok, Chief Executive Officer of Midas International Asset,
which according to Bloomberg data holds more than 20,000 Mando
shares. “This issue clearly invades shareholders’ profits.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
