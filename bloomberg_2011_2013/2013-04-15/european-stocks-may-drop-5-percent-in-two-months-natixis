European stocks may drop more than
5 percent in the next two months after breaching a key support
last week, according to a technical analyst at Natixis SA.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  may decline to its next support
level of 274 in the next two months, Ouri Mimran said in a
telephone interview from Paris today.  “The index breached the major support level at around 287
points on April 5, which was the main event and confirmed we’re
probably heading toward a consolidation,” Mimran said. “The
index rebounded last week, but nevertheless failed to breach a
short-term resistance level at 296 points, suggesting that it
will return to last week’s low point before initiating a
correction over the weeks ahead.”  The gauge posted its biggest weekly advance in more than a
month last week amid speculation that central banks will
continue to provide monetary stimulus and as a report showed
Chinese imports beat forecasts. The Stoxx 600 has  rallied 24
percent  since June 4, when it reached its lowest level in 2012.  A breach above the level of 296 would invalidate the
scenario of a correction, Mimran said. The Stoxx 600 dropped 1.1
percent to 289.33 at 12:14 p.m. in  London  today.  In technical analysis, investors study charts of trading
patterns and prices to predict changes in a stock, commodity,
currency or index. Analysts identify resistance levels, or
ceilings limiting further gains, and supports, which act as
floors in a declining market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
