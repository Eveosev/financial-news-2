Saudi Arabia  approved $96 million
of water and sanitation projects including reservoirs across the
kingdom, state-owned  Saudi Press Agency  reported, citing
Minister of Water and Electricity Abdullah Al-Hussayen.  The 25 projects given the state go-ahead also include water
treatment plants, pumping stations and expanding sewage networks
from Dammam, Abha, Afif, Jazan to Tabouk in the Arab worldâ€™s
largest economy, SPA said. Saudi Arabia, the biggest oil
producer, is also the largest producer of desalinated water.  Saudi Arabia spent $1.1 billion last year on 128 water and
sanitation contracts just in the capital Riyadh. Al-Hussayen
says $6.4 billion has been allocated for water and sanitation
projects for this year. The ministry has 194 water projects
pending at present for 2013 on its  official website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
