The Philippine peso rose for the
first time in three days on speculation Filipinos working
overseas will send more money home in the coming weeks.
 Government bonds  advanced.  Remittances account for about 10 percent of the $225
billion economy, and inflows usually increase before the
nation’s school year starts in June. The transfers climbed in
May 2012 by $72.5 million from the previous month to $1.77
billion, having risen $72 million in May 2011, central bank data
show. Only three months recorded bigger increases in the last
two years. Figures for February are due to be reported today.  “Overseas Filipino workers remit more dollars than normal
in April and May to pay for their kids’ tuition,” said Lito
Mercado, head of trading at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. in
 Manila . “Banks would be cautious being long on dollars.”  The peso appreciated 0.1 percent to 41.210 per dollar as of
10:33 a.m. in Manila, according to prices from Tullett Prebon
Plc. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, increased 13 basis
points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 4.72 percent.  The currency lost 0.9 percent this month on speculation the
central bank will cut the  interest rate  on its special-deposit
accounts for a third time this year. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas
Governor Amando Tetangco said April 3 the option of reducing the
rate will be retained. The next policy review is scheduled for
April 25.  The yield on the 8 percent government bonds due July 2031
dropped 11 basis points to 3.75 percent, according to prices
from Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
