The koruna rebounded from its weakest level in 16 months after the Czech Republic unexpectedly posted its highest current-account surplus on record.  The koruna appreciated 0.3 percent to 25.836 per euro as of 5:39 p.m. in  Prague , reversing an earlier 0.3 percent retreat to 25.988, the lowest intraday level since November 2011. The  yield  on 10-year government bonds dropped seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to an all-time low of 1.67 percent, according to generic indexes compiled by Bloomberg.  The Czech current account, a broader measure of goods and money flowing into and out of the country, had a surplus of 27.7 billion koruna ($1.4 billion) in February, the statistics office in Prague said today. That is the best reading since Bloomberg began tracking the data in 2003 and compares with the median estimate of 11 economists for a 5.2 billion-koruna surplus.  “The February balance-of-payments data published today confirmed that the Czech koruna is safe in terms of external balance,”  Jan Vejmelek , an economist at  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  in Prague, wrote in an e-mailed report. The figures “significantly exceeded the most optimistic market expectations,” he said.
