China , the largest foreign lender
to the U.S. government, boosted its holdings of Treasuries in
February to the most in 15 months, while No. 2  Japan  sold the
debt for a fourth-consecutive month.  China’s  position  increased $8.7 billion, or 0.7 percent, to
$1.223 trillion, U.S. Treasury Department data released
yesterday show. Japan’s holdings dipped $6.8 billion, or 0.6
percent, to $1.097 trillion, the lowest since April 2012. Since
reaching a peak of $1.132 trillion in October, Japan has shed
$34.8 billion of the securities.  Demand for the debt from overseas investors cooled in
February as U.S. economic data showed improvement and as
speculation increased that Japan would expand its purchases of
its own government debt. The U.S. created 268,000 jobs in
February, Labor Department data released April 5 showed. The
unresolved Italian elections held Feb. 24 fueled some month-end
demand.  “February was a month more driven by the fundamentals,”
said  George Goncalves , head of interest-rate strategy at Nomura
Holdings Inc., one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the
 Federal Reserve . “There was volatility toward the end when the
Italian election didn’t go as planned.”  Traders anticipated that Japan,  Asia ’s second-biggest
economy, will maintain easing measures that tend to spur
declines in the currency. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and
his aides have said the yen is only correcting past gains and
that their call for more aggressive monetary policy is centered
on helping the economy.  Yields Decline  “China continues to buy and goes a little bit against the
grain,” Goncalves said. “Japan at large was waiting for
something from the policy side, setting themselves up locally,
which required them to sell some Treasuries. It was more about a
trade heading into the QE announcement.”  The benchmark 10-year  Treasury yield  fell 11 basis points
or 0.11 percentage point, to 1.88 percent in February. It
reached a high for the year of 2.08 percent March 8. The yield
dropped four basis points to 1.68 percent yesterday in  New York .  Abe, elected in December, campaigned to spur growth, with
investors speculating he would seek a more aggressive central
bank, driving down the yen. China had added U.S. government
securities as part of a strategy to support rapid economic
growth, buying the debt to limit gains in its currency to
maintain the pace of its exports.  Marketable Debt  Holdings of Treasuries outside the U.S. rose in February by
$13.9 billion, or 0.2 percent, to $5.657 trillion, the 14th
consecutive monthly increase, the data show. Foreign investors
have boosted their holdings 1.5 percent in the first two months
of 2013 after climbing 11.3 percent in 2012 and 12.8 percent in
2011.  The U.S.  marketable borrowing  reached $11.3 trillion in
February, and was up 11.2 percent for all of 2012, Treasury data
show.  Foreign investors owned 50 percent of the marketable debt,
the least since March 2012, the data, known as Treasury
International Capital, show. China held 10.8 percent of the  U.S.
debt  in February while Japan’s stake comprised 9.7 percent of
U.S. government obligations, the least since August 2011.  Of the $5.657 trillion Treasuries held outside of the U.S.,
71.5 percent, or $4.047 trillion, are owned by  official
institutions  including central banks, finance ministries and
other fiscal agents, Treasury data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
