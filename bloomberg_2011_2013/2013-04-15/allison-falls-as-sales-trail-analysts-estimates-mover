Allison Transmission Holdings Inc. (ALSN) ,
the maker of transmissions for heavy trucks, buses and the
military, fell the most since becoming a public company after
reporting lower preliminary sales than analysts had estimated.  The shares tumbled 6.8 percent to $22.17 at the close in
New York, the biggest one-day drop since it sold shares to the
public 13 months ago. The Indianapolis-based company has gained
8.6 percent this year.  Sales in the three months ended March 31 were $455 million
to $460 million, the company said in a preliminary statement of
earnings. The average of seven estimates in a Bloomberg survey
was for sales of $471.7 million.  Allison said the results “reflect considerably lower
demand” in the hydraulic fracturing market in  North America  and
lower defense sales. Allison received $305 million of its $2.14
billion in revenue last year from military  customers .  The company also plans to double its quarterly dividend to
12 cents a share on May 31 to shareholders of record as of May
17. Separately, Allison said it is selling 22 million shares on
behalf of shareholders including  Carlyle Group  and Onex Corp.,
the two investment firms that bought the company from the
predecessor of  General Motors Co. (GM)  in 2007 and took it public in
March 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
