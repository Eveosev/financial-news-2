Trianel GmbH, a group of German
municipal utilities, said it installed the “power socket” for
its  wind farm  in the  North Sea .  Trianel today finished installing a 2,400-metric ton
converter platform that will transfer power produced at sea for
use in the land-based electricity grid, according to an e-mailed
statement. The group plans to erect Areva SA-made 5-megawatt
wind turbines starting next month, it said.  “We have not only installed the power socket for the wind
farm with the converter platform but also laid the foundation
for the next construction phase,” said Klaus Horstick, head of
the group’s project company.  The wind farm’s opening has been delayed to the fourth
quarter from the start of the year due to delays at grid company
TenneT TSO GmbH in connecting the project to the grid. Trianel
will power the turbines with two diesel generators until the
grid link goes live to protect them from damages, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
