Colombia ’s peso fell to an 11-month
low on speculation that a government stimulus package scheduled
to be announced today will weaken the currency.  The peso weakened 0.5 percent to 1834.30 per  U.S. dollar  at
8:59 a.m. in Bogota, the weakest level on a closing basis since
May 24 last year.  The government will present a stimulus plan for industry
and agriculture this morning including measures to help
exporters by weakening the peso. Finance Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  told a meeting of the country’s pension fund
association April 12 that the peso is about 10 percent
overvalued.  “The government’s action plan has been influencing the
 currency market  a lot since last week,” said Diana Guiza, an
analyst at Bogota-based brokerage Corredores Asociados. “People
have speculated that they could force pension funds to invest
much more in dollars.”  Colombian pension funds should invest more outside the
country, to diversify and reduce risk, Cardenas said last week.  Yields on Colombia’s peso bonds maturing in 2024 rose three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.03 percent,
according to the central bank. The price fell 0.3440 centavo to
141.9370 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
