Chrysler Group LLC, the U.S.
automaker majority owned by  Fiat SpA (F) , moved Reid Bigland from
chief executive officer of the Dodge brand to the Ram truck
business, replacing Fred Diaz, who left to join  Nissan Motor (7201)  Co.  Bigland, who started with Chrysler in 2006, retains his
roles as head of U.S. sales and CEO of Chrysler Canada. Tim Kuniskis, a 21-year Chrysler employee and former leader of the
Fiat brand in North America, will succeed Bigland as Dodge brand
chief, the  Auburn Hills , Michigan-based company said in a
statement.  The moves come as Chrysler tries to maintain its streak of
36 consecutive monthly U.S. sales gains, the longest stretch in
company records that date back to 1985, Chrysler surprised
analysts last year when it was the only major U.S. automaker to
gain share in its home market.  Jason Stoicevich, a 10-year Chrysler veteran, will take
over as head of Fiat for  North America  and continue to run the
company’s California office. Bruno Cattori was named head of
Chrysler’s operations in Mexico, another post held by Diaz, who
spent 24 years at Chrysler.  Diaz begins May 1 as vice president of sales and marketing
for the Nissan brand in the U.S., the Yokohama, Japan-based
company said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
