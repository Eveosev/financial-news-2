Argentina  has sold $5 billion of
grain since Jan. 2, heading for record exports as the country
expects production to increase by 20 percent this year.  “We don’t have a forecast for this year but at this pace
the number may hit a record,” said Andres Alcaraz, spokesman
for Ciara-Cec in a telephone interview from  Buenos Aires .  Last week’s grain sales accelerated to $716 million as
soybean and corn crops are being harvested, grain exporting
association Ciara-Cec said today in an e-mailed statement.
Harvesting of Argentina’s corn and soybean crop is 28 percent
and 24 percent completed, respectively, the Buenos Aires Grains
Exchange said April 11.  After a drought cut last year’s production, Argentina’s
corn and soybean crops are expected to expand this year by 20
percent, the exchange has said. In 2012, grain exports brought
$23 billion to the country, the second-highest revenue after
2011’s record $25 billion, according to Ciara-Cec.  Argentina is the world’s biggest shipper of  soybean oil  and
the third-biggest exporter of unprocessed beans.  Soybean farmers, who pay a 35 percent levy on exports, are
expected to produce 48.5 million tons of the oilseed this year,
up from 40 million tons in 2012, according to the exchange. The
soybean crop will be 50.58 million tons, according to the
average estimate of 26 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Grain exports represent one-third of Argentina’s total
exports, according to the grain association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
