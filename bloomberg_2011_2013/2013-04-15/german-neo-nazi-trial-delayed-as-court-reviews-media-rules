The German trial of a neo-Nazi cell accused of a series of murders that targeted mostly victims of Turkish origin was delayed today as a court relented to criticism that its media rules excluded international press.  The trial will begin on May 6 instead of April 17 as the Munich Higher Regional Court starts a new accreditation process for the press, the court said today in an e-mailed statement. The court had drawn controversy from journalists’ organizations as well as the Turkish government for its media policy.  Germany ’s  Federal Constitutional Court  three days ago ruled that the lower court must overhaul its procedure to admit international news outlets. The Munich court initially granted entrance on a first-come, first-served basis, drawing a volley of criticism after the policy left Turkish media and most international news organizations without a guaranteed place in the courtroom.  Eight of at least 10 suspected victims killed across Germany between 2000 and 2006 were of Turkish origin. The others, targeted by what authorities identified as an underground neo-Nazi cell known as the National Socialist Underground, were a Greek man and a German policewoman.  Beate Zschaepe, a 38-year-old member of the cell, was to appear in court this week alongside four other NSU supporters for the first time. The court’s security protocol and media attention were reminiscent of the 1970s trials against the Red Army Faction terrorist group in Germany.  The crime spree came to light in November 2011 after Zschaepe’s companions, Uwe Boehnhardt and Uwe Mundlos, committed suicide in a camper van in eastern Germany. The probe led to the discovery of the NSU, prompting investigators and politicians to ask how a right-wing terror cell could have operated underground for over a decade.  Chancellor Angela Merkel  called the events, which led to a parliamentary investigation and scrutiny over Germany’s patchwork of state-led counterintelligence bodies, a “disgrace for Germany” in November 2011.
