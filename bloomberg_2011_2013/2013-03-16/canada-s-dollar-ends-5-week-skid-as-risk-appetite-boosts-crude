Canada ’s dollar strengthened for
the first time in six weeks against its U.S. peer on signs of
economic growth as crude oil, the nation’s biggest export, rose
to a three-week high amid increased risk appetite.  The currency gained against a majority of its most-traded
peers after a report showed that inflation in the U.S., Canada’s
largest trading partner, is contained, giving the Federal
Reserve scope to maintain its monetary stimulus program before a
policy meeting next week. Canadian retail sales grew in January
after falling the month before, according to a Bloomberg News
survey before the report’s March 21 release.  “Canadian negative fundamentals have driven Canadian
dollar softness over the past couple of months, so it seemed
like it was due for a pullback,” Greg T. Moore, a currency
strategist at  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , said yesterday by phone.
“It has the potential to extend further into the mid-to-low
C$1.01 area -- it has support down there.” Support refers to an
area on a chart where buy orders may be clustered.  The loonie, as Canada’s dollar is nicknamed for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, appreciated 0.9 percent to
C$1.0194 per  U.S. dollar  this week in Toronto. It touched
C$1.0181 on Friday, the strongest level since Feb. 22. One
Canadian dollar buys 98.10 U.S. cents.  Bonds Rise  Canada’s benchmark 10-year government bond increased, with
yields falling four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to
1.90 percent. The 2.75 percent security that matures in June
2022 gained 31 cents to C$107.20.  The  Bank of Canada  auctioned C$1.5 billion ($1.46 billion)
of 30-year bonds on March 13, drawing an average yield of 2.624
percent, up from 2.289 percent at the last auction on Nov. 28.
The 3.5 percent securities mature in December 2045.  Futures traders increased their bets that the Canadian
dollar will decline against the U.S. dollar to the highest level
since March 2007, figures from the Washington-based Commodity
Futures Trading Commission show.  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on a decline in the Canadian dollar
compared with those on a gain -- so-called net shorts -- was
53,397 on March 12, compared with net shorts of 46,663 a week
earlier.  At the same time, traders were the least bearish on the
loonie in six weeks as so-called risk-reversals show options
traders are paying the least for protection against loonie
weakness since Feb 2. The three-month 25-delta risk reversal
rate touched 0.98 percentage point yesterday from as much as
1.49 percentage points on Feb. 26, its highest since Sept. 7.  ‘Most Important’  Futures on crude oil advanced for a second week, increasing
1.5 percent to $93.45 a barrel in  New York , after touching
$93.84 per barrel, the strongest since Feb. 25.  Western Canada Select, the benchmark for oil-sands bitumen,
traded at a  discount  of $20 on Friday to U.S. West Texas
Intermediate price after hitting $18.50 on March 11, the lowest
since Oct. 17. The discount has fallen from $42.50 since Dec.
15.  “The Western Canada Select-West Texas Intermediate spread
should be on every Canadian dollar traders screen, because it’s
the most important factor in trade right now,” Adam Button,
currency analyst for Forexlive.com in  Montreal , said by phone on
March 14.  Lumber futures for May delivery rose $10 on March 14, the
most allowed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The Standard &
Poor’s GSCI Index of 24  raw materials  rose for the second week
after hitting the highest level since Feb. 27. Raw materials,
including oil, account for almost half of all of Canada’s
exports.  U.S. Numbers  “The strength in the U.S. numbers is helpful for the
Canadian currency,”  Nick Bennenbroek , the head currency
strategist at  Wells Fargo & Co ., said in a phone interview on
March 14. “It comes in the context of fairly solid employment
reports from the U.S. and Canada last week.”  The loonie has strengthened 1 percent since March 8, when
data showed employment gains in Canada and the U.S. exceeded
forecasts, with both nations’ unemployment rates at four-year
lows.  This week, first-time  jobless claims  in the U.S. fell to
the fewest since mid-January as retail sales in the world’s
largest economy rose in February by the most in five months.  Canada’s dollar has lost 0.5 percent this year against nine
developed-nation peers tracked by the Bloomberg Correlation
Weighted Indexes. The greenback has gained 2.5 percent and the
Japanese yen has lost 7.6 percent, the biggest decline in the
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
