LeBron James and Chris Bosh each
scored 28 points to lead the Miami Heat to a 107-94 win against
the  Milwaukee  Bucks and sole possession of the third-longest
National Basketball Association winning streak at 21 games.  The Heat surpassed the Bucks’ 20-game winning streak in
1970-71 and are one victory from matching the 2007-08 Houston
Rockets’ run of 22 straight wins. The NBA record is held by the
1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers, who tallied 33 straight wins en
route to an NBA title.  Dwyane Wade had 20 points, nine assists and seven rebounds
last night for the Heat, who had a 51-42 halftime lead at BMO
Harris Bradley Center in Milwaukee.  Miami has the best record in the league at 50-14, one game
ahead of the San Antonio Spurs (50-16). The Bucks (32-32) hold
the Eastern Conference’s eighth playoff spot, putting them in
position to play the Heat in the first round of the postseason.  Ersan Ilyasova had 26 points and 17 rebounds and Brandon Jennings scored 21 points for the Bucks.  In Indianapolis, the Lakers’ Kobe Bryant went scoreless in
12 minutes before leaving Los Angeles’ 99-93 win against the
Indiana Pacers with pain in his sprained left ankle. It was the
15th time in his 17-year NBA career that he was held scoreless.  To contact the reporter on this story:
