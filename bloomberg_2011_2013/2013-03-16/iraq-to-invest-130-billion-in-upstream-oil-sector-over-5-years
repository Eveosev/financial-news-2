Iraq  plans to spend $130 billion on
the country’s upstream sector over the next five years to help
raise production capacity to 9 million barrels a day, Oil
Minister Abdul Kareem al-Luaibi said.  The country will allocate $18 billion to raise natural gas
output and $25 billion to expand refinery capacity, al-Luaibi
said at a conference in Basrah today. Iraq forecasts $600
billion in revenue from the oil expansion, he said.  Iraq, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries’ second-largest producer, is boosting output and
upgrading energy facilities hobbled by decades of war and
economic sanctions. Production swelled by 24 percent last year,
and Iraq overtook  Iran  in June to become the biggest producer
after Saudi Arabia in OPEC.  Iraqi output rose 6 percent to 3.14 million barrels a day
in February, up from 2.97 million barrels the previous month,
according to the the Paris-based International Energy Agency.
This was the first time in two months that it exceeded 3 million
barrels a day, mostly as a result of increased tanker exports
from Basrah in southern Iraq, the agency said.  The nation’s oil exports in February reached 2.54 million
barrels a day, al-Luaibi said. Production from Iraq’s Majnoon
oilfield will reach 100,000 barrels a day in May and 200,000
daily by the end of the year, he said.  Iraq holds the world’s fifth-biggest crude reserves,
according to  BP Plc (BP/)  statistics that include  Canada ’s oil sands.  To contact the reporter on this story:
