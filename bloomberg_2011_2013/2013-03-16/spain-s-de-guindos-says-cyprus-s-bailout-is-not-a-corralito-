Spanish Economy Minister Luis De
Guindos said the levy imposed on Cypriot bank depositors as a
condition of the bailout agreed early today does not constitute
a “corralito.”  The Spanish word corralito, meaning pen, refers to the
restrictions Argentinian officials placed on bank withdrawals in
2001 as their currency tumbled and is particularly resonant for
Spaniards because so many Argentinians moved to  Madrid  as a
result of that crisis.  European and International Monetary Fund officials set a
one-off tax of up to 9.9 percent on all bank deposits as a
condition of the 10 billion-euro ($13 billion) rescue package
for Cyprus.  “This is not a corralito because only the taxes will be
withheld,” De Guindos’s Economy Ministry said in an e-mailed
statement today. “Deposits will not be frozen, people will be
able to move their money freely.”  “This situation cannot be extrapolated to any other
country in the euro zone,” the ministry added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
