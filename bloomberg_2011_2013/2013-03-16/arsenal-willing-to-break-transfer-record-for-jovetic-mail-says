Arsenal is prepared to break the
club’s transfer record to sign Fiorentina striker Stevan
Jovetic, the Daily Mail reported.  Jovetic, 23, has emerged as Arsenal’s top target for the
offseason with manager Arsene Wenger willing to meet
Fiorentina’s valuation of 20 million pounds ($30 million), the
Mail said. That would eclipse the 15 million pounds the Gunners
paid Zenit St. Petersburg for Andrey Arshavin in 2009.  Wenger has a 70 million-pound transfer budget, but that may
be cut if Arsenal fails to qualify for the Champions League, the
Mail said. Jovetic is unlikely to consider a move without the
prospect of playing in  Europe ’s top club competition.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
