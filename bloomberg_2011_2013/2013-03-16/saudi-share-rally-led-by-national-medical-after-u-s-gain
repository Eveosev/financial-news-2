Saudi Arabian (SASEIDX)  shares advanced for
the second day, led by National Medical Care Co. and  Saudi Basic
Industries (SABIC)  Corp., after the U.S.’s benchmark index climbed to a
near-record high this week.  National Medical Care has increased almost five-fold from
its book value price of 27 riyals a share since it started
trading on March 13. Saudi Basic Industries, the world’s largest
petrochemical maker, advanced to the highest level since Feb.
16.  The Tadawul All Share Index gained 0.5 percent to 7057.10,
the highest since March 9, at 11:36 a.m. in Riyadh. The Arab
world’s biggest stock exchange added 3.7 percent this year,
compared with the  Dubai Financial Market ’s gain of 18 percent.  “The attention is now on the newcomer to the market
National Medical Care, which was listed last Wednesday,” said
Mohammed Al-Omran, a financial analyst and president of the Gulf
Center for Financial Consultancy in  Riyadh . “The book building
valued the stock at 27 riyals, and it closed at 122 riyals a
share on the first day. The market is speculative driven by
National Medical Care.”  U.S. stocks climbed for the week, sending the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index within five points of a record high, as better-
than-estimated retail sales and jobless claims data boosted
optimism in the world’s largest economy. The  S&P 500 (SPX)  advanced
0.6 percent to 1,560.70, for its third straight weekly gain. The
Dow climbed for a fourth week, adding 117.04 points, or 0.8
percent, to 14,514.11.  National Medical Care climbed 4.9 percent to 126 riyals,
while Saudi Basic Industries advanced 0.5 percent to 94 riyals.  Saudi Arabia ’s stock exchange is the only Persian Gulf
bourse operating on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
