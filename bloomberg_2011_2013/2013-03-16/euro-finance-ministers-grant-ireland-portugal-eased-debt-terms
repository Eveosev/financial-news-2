Euro-area finance ministers agreed
to extend maturities on rescue loans to Ireland and  Portugal ,
easing the terms on two recipients of European bailout aid in a
show of support for their commitment to austerity.  The ministers gave no details on the extension. Those will
be worked out by the so-called troika that oversees euro-area
bailouts and the European Financial Stability Facility, the
currency bloc’s temporary rescue fund, the finance chiefs said 
today. The details will be presented to euro ministers at the 
same time as the memorandum of understanding underlying a 
rescue program for Cyprus.  “The Eurogroup ministers are determined to support
Ireland’s and Portugal’s efforts to regain full  market access 
and successfully exit their well-performing programs, in the
context of continued strong program implementation and
compliance,” the group said in a statement in Brussels.  Ireland and Portugal have sought to return to the  bond
market  after soaring yields prevented their governments from
borrowing in 2010 and 2011. Ireland sold 10-year bonds this week
for the first time since receiving its bailout assistance,
marking a milestone in overcoming the debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
