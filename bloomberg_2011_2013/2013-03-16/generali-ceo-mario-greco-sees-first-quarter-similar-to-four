Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G)  Chief
Executive Officer  Mario Greco  said he’s “counting on a quarter
very similar” to the fourth and “numbers that continue to be
positive.”  France is “giving results” and “Germany continues to
perform well,” Greco said in an interview with Class CNBC
published by MF-today. A Generali spokesman confirmed the
comments to  Bloomberg News  today.  Greco said he continues to see economic difficulties in
Spain and Italy affecting Generali, Italy’s biggest insurer,
while the year has started in line with  expectations . The
executive, who started in August, is seeking to revive profit
and boost capital by cutting costs, disposing of assets and
targeting faster-growing emerging markets. The Trieste-based
company is selling its U.S. life-reinsurance business and Swiss
asset-management unit BSI Group as part of a plan approved in
January.  Generali on March 14 said its fourth-quarter operating
profit climbed 12 percent from a year earlier to 928 million
euros ($1.2 billion), boosted by the non-life insurance
business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
