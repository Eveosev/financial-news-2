Former Egyptian Tourism Minister
Zoheir Garranah and ex-Housing Minister Ahmed El Maghraby, both
of whom served under ousted President  Hosni Mubarak , were
acquitted today in land-sale cases, a court said.  Garranah was accused of selling 5 million square meters of
land in Al-Ain Al-Sokhna to businessman Hisham El-Hatheq for $1
a meter, the Giza Criminal Court said in a faxed statement. El-
Hatheq was also cleared.  The two ex-ministers and Khaled Makhlouf, chairman of the
Tourism Development Authority, were also found not guilty to
charges of profiteering, squandering public funds and illegally
seizing state land in the coastal city of Hurgada, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
