European Union Economic and
Monetary Commissioner Olli Rehn said there won’t be a repeat of
the tax on bank deposits that was imposed as part of Cyprus’s
aid program.  Asked whether a future EU-mandated bank levy can be
categorically ruled out, Rehn said that “it can and there is no
concrete case where it should be considered.”  Speaking in an interview in Brussels early today after euro
finance chiefs worked out the 10 billion-euro ($13 billion)
Cypriot package, Rehn said he doesn’t expect an adverse market
reaction to the precedent-setting tax on deposits both above and
below the insured limit of 100,000 euros.  “Market forces understand that the sheer size of the
problem of the Cypriot banking sector and its troubles were so
huge that we needed to take very substantial measures,” Rehn
said. “This kind of stability fee is clearly a much better
choice from the point of view of financial stability and Cypriot
citizens than a full-scale bail-in, which would have led to very
chaotic consequences in the Cypriot economy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
