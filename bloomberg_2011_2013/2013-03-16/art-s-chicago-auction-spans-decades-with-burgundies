Romanee-Conti wines from the 1990s
and earlier will be among leading lots at a Hart Davis Hart Wine
Co. auction in  Chicago  this month devoted to Burgundy, as demand
for the region’s top producers drives the broader market.  The sale on March 23 will include 175 lots of Domaine de la
Romanee-Conti spanning 33 vintages from 1966 onwards, including
three bottles of 1999 Romanee-Conti DRC estimated to fetch as
much as $35,000 and another three-bottle lot of the 1991 vintage
with a top estimate of $32,000. A 10-bottle lot of La Tache DRC
spanning the first decade of this century may fetch as much as
$28,000, according to the auction house.  Wine prices have revived over the past four months after
the London-based Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index slumped in November
to its lowest level since March 2010. It has rallied 10 percent
since then, including 2.9 percent in February, and in January
advanced 3.5 percent, its biggest monthly gain for two years.  “Burgundy is certainly making waves across the world and
in no small part due to fragmented ownership and very small
production volumes,” Peter Lunzer, founder of Lunzer Wine
Investments in  London , said in his February market report.  “Recent demand for top Burgundy producers far exceeds
supply,” Lunzer said. He helps manage wine investment and
trading accounts worth $34 million.  Henri Jayer  The  Hart  sale also contains 52 lots of wines from Henri Jayer, including a bottle of 1985 Richebourg carrying a top
estimate of $14,000 and two bottles of 1985 Vosne-Romanee Cros
Parantoux estimated at as much as $12,000.  Jayer died in 2006 and has become one of Burgundy’s most
sought-after wine-makers. At a Hart auction in February, 12
bottles of Jayer’s 1990 Cros Parantoux sold for $113,525.  Acker Merrall & Condit sales are scheduled in  Hong Kong  and
 New York  later this month, while Christie’s has a London
auction.  Here is a list of global wine auctions scheduled so far
this year. Dates may be subject to revision, and links are to
