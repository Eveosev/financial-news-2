U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
said getting the economy growing again will be “tough” and
that his Conservative Party has a “real fight” on its hands to
win the next election.  “Anyone who thinks it’s going to get easier, they’re
wrong,” Cameron said in a speech to the Conservative spring
conference in  London  today. “And we have never been more up for
the task of turning our country around.”  With Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  set to
present his next budget on March 20, Cameron is facing calls
from both the Conservatives and their Liberal Democrat coalition
partners to do more to prevent an unprecedented triple-dip
recession. Cameron saw the U.K.’s top credit rating downgraded
last month and his party, behind in the polls for a year, was
pushed into third place in a special election, stoking criticism
of his leadership.  “This is a battle for Britain’s future we are engaged
in,” Cameron told activists. “So let the message go out from
this hall and this party: We are here to fight. We are here to
win.”  Conservative Party  Chairman Grant Shapps said this week the
Tories may not win the next election in 2015, making him the
most senior lawmaker to openly talk about the possibility of
losing power.  “We may or may not win the next election, but my God we
need to finish this, the job of stopping this country going
bust, fixing the mess that Labour left, or at least as far as we
can,” Shapps said in an interview with the House magazine,
which is distributed to lawmakers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
