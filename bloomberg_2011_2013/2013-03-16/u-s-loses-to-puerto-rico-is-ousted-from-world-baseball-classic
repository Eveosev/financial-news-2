The U.S. was eliminated from the
World Baseball Classic with a 4-3 second-round loss to Puerto
Rico, which advanced to the semifinals.  Andy Gonzalez had a two-run double in Puerto Ricoâ€™s three-
run sixth inning and former Major League Baseball pitcher Nelson
Figueroa, 38, held the U.S. to two hits in six innings for the
win tonight in Miami.  Puerto Rico joins the Dominican Republic,  Japan  and the
Netherlands in the semifinals starting March 17 in San
Francisco. Puerto Rico plays the Dominican Republic tomorrow in
Miami to determine pairings for the semifinals.  The U.S. lost two of its three second-round games,
including a 3-1 defeat by the Dominicans last night in Miami.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
