Top Burgundies including Romanee-
Conti, Cros Parantoux and La Tache led bidding at a Zachys wine
auction in  New York  this month amid demand for rare vintages
from collectors and investors in the U.S. and Hong Kong.  A six-liter Methuselah of Romanee-Conti 1990 Domaine de la
Romanee-Conti fetched $171,500 at the two-day sale ended March
8, while a case of Vosne-Romanee Cros Parantoux Henri Jayer 1997
sold for $39,200 and a three-liter jeroboam of La Tache Domaine
de la Romanee-Conti went under the hammer for $29,400.  The sale came after Burgundy wines also led auctions held
by Acker Merrall & Condit in New York and Christie’s
International Plc online last month. While the broader wine
market has rebounded since December, demand has focused more on
rarer Burgundies as Asian collectors sought to diversify away
from heavily-traded Bordeaux labels. The London-based Liv-ex
Fine Wine 50 Index rose 2.9 percent in February, its third
straight monthly gain.  “We saw an increased presence of people from  Hong Kong ,
definitely more than last year,” Julia Gilbert, auction
director at Zachys, said in a telephone interview. “I think
that’s going to continue.”  Three bottles of Romanee-Conti DRC 2008 and a separate
three-bottle lot of the same producer’s 2006 vintage both sold
for $26,950 each, according to an e-mail from Zachys.  Six magnums of Bonnes Mares Georges Roumier 1999 fetched
$18,375, beating the  auction house ’s presale estimate, while a
six-bottle lot of white Corton Charlemagne Coche-Dury 2005 also
went under the hammer for the same price.  Burgundy Outlook  Other lots included a magnum of Musigny Vieilles Vignes
Comte Georges de Vogue 1947, which sold for $10,413, and six
bottles of La Tache DRC 2002 which went under the hammer for
$11,025.  Among top Burgundies sold at recent auctions around the
world, six bottles of white Montrachet 1993 Domaine de la
Romanee-Conti fetched the top price at a Sotheby’s wine sale in
London on Feb. 27, selling for 21,150 pounds ($32,060) and
matching the auction house’s high estimate.  While demand for Burgundy remains strong at auctions around
the world, some wine investors are cautious about the outlook.  “We’ve seen Burgundy prices rise,”  Chris Smith ,
investment manager at The Wine Investment Fund in London, said.
“I would be worried about the risk profile.” The fund, which
has about $50 million under management, is currently invested
purely in Bordeaux, partly because the larger wine production
from that region’s estates makes them easier to trade.  Auction Demand  Acker Merrall & Condit sold a three-bottle lot of Romanee
Conti 2006 Domaine de la Romanee-Conti for $27,060 at a New York
sale on Feb. 23, along with 12 bottles of Leroy Romanee-Saint-
Vivant 1962 for $24,600 and Rousseau Chambertin Clos de Beze
1990 for $18,450.  Christie’s sold a case of Montrachet 1988 DRC for $33,880
at a February online auction, with two bottles of the 1985
vintage fetching $7,260, while two 12-bottle Domaine de la
Romanee-Conti Assortment cases from 1999 sold for 28,200 pounds
each at  Sotheby’s (BID)  in London on Jan. 30.  Following is a table of major auctions held so far this
