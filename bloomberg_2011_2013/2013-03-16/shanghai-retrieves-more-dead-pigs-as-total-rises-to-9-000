Authorities in  Shanghai ,  China ’s
financial hub, pulled a further 1,420 dead pigs today and
yesterday from the Huangpu river, bringing the total number of
carcasses to close to 9,000.  The municipal government said two-thirds are piglets,
according to statements on its official microblog. Water quality
in the city is tested as normal, the government said.  Zhao Shumei, vice mayor of Jiaxing, where the pigs are
reportedly from, said the city retrieved 3,601 dead pigs from
fields and rivers last week and it is inconclusive that all the
pigs were from Jiaxing, according to a  report  on the People’s
Daily’s website people.com.cn.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
