U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and Afghan President Hamid Karzai have agreed to use the
next week to conduct “intensive work” to resolve issues related
to  Afghanistan ’s sovereignty and security.  Hagel and Karzai spoke today by telephone about “issues of
shared concern, including detentions,” according to Pentagon
Press Secretary  George Little .  Today’s telephone call and agreement to work together
follow Hagel’s first visit to Afghanistan as defense secretary
last weekend. During the visit, a planned transfer of prisoners
being held by the U.S. at Bagram air base outside Kabul to
Afghan control was delayed because the two sides couldn’t agree
on the terms of the handover. Karzai had said he would release
some of the prisoners after the transfer.  There were also suicide attacks in Kabul and Khost province
during Hagel’s visit, and Karzai said in a speech on March 10
that the U.S. is colluding with the radical Islamic Taliban and
the bombs were in the “service of America.”  The trip gave Hagel, who took office March 1, a close-up
view of the military and political obstacles the Obama
administration faces as it tries to extricate the U.S. from a
war it’s been waging for more than 11 years at a cost of 2,170
American lives so far.  At the same time, the U.S. must help train Afghan forces to
take over the fight, root out official corruption, curb opium
trafficking, and develop the country’s economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
