Treasuries rose, with yields
slipping from almost 11-month highs, as a government report
showed U.S. inflation was contained, giving the Federal Reserve
scope to maintain its monetary-stimulus program.  Benchmark  10-year note  yields dropped below 2 percent
yesterday for the first time in six days on a closing basis,
ending the longest streak above that level in almost a year,
even after data signaled the economy is improving. Consumer
prices rose 2 percent in February from a year earlier, below the
level the central bank has listed as one condition for backing
off on its efforts to spur growth. Policy makers meet next week.  “Things have been coming in better, but I don’t think it’s
enough better to get people off the idea that the Fed is going
to remain accommodative,” said  Jay Mueller , who manages about
$3 billion of bonds at Wells Fargo Capital Management in
 Milwaukee . “It’s still all about the Fed.”  Ten-year note  yields fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 1.99 percent this week in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. They had held above 2
percent for the previous five days on a closing basis, the
longest since April. The yields reached 2.08 percent on March 8,
the highest level since April 5. The price of the 2 percent
security due in February 2023 gained 15/32, or $4.69 per $1,000
face value, to 100 3/32.  Thirty-year bond  yields decreased three basis points to
3.21 percent after touching 3.28 percent March 8, also the
highest since April 5. Two-year notes yielded 0.25 percent.  Yield Gap  The yield difference between two- and 30-year Treasuries
narrowed to 2.96 percentage points yesterday from 3 percentage
points on March 11, the widest in 11 months.  The consumer price index’s increase came after a 1.6
percent year-over-year gain in January. Core CPI, which excludes
food and fuel, also rose 2 percent from February 2012, following
a 1.9 percent increase in the prior 12-month period.  Fed policy makers reiterated after their January policy
meeting that their key  interest rate  will stay at almost zero as
long as inflation is projected at no more than 2.5 percent and
 unemployment  is above 6.5 percent. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said this month the Fed will keep buying bonds under
quantitative easing until there’s “substantial improvement” in
the labor market. The jobless rate was 7.7 percent in February.  The central bank buys $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage
debt a month. A two-day Fed policy meeting begins March 19.  Treasuries gained yesterday as a gauge of U.S.  consumer
confidence  unexpectedly slid. The Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan preliminary sentiment index for March fell to 71.8, the
lowest since December 2011, versus a forecast for a gain to 78.  ‘Not Good’  “The confidence data is not good,” said Tom Simons, an
economist in New York at Jefferies LLC, one of the 21 primary
dealers that trade with the Fed. “If you looked at all the data
this week you would think that the economy was picking up a bit
of momentum. There’s been one direction of data and this is the
first move in the other direction.”  U.S. retail sales rose 1.1 percent in February, the
Commerce Department said March 13, more than twice the forecast
in a Bloomberg survey. Initial Jobless-benefit claims
unexpectedly fell last week, the Labor Department said.  Ten- and 30-year yields climbed to 11-month highs on March
8 after the Labor Department reported U.S. employers added
236,000 jobs last month, beating a forecast of 165,000.  Fed Help  “The data has been overwhelmingly strong,”  Thomas Roth ,
senior Treasury trader in New York at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities
USA Inc., said March 11. “The Fed is obviously lowering rates
and helping the economy, and that’s what’s going on.”  The Treasury auctioned $66 billion of notes and bonds this
week. It sold $32 billion of three-year debt at a yield of 0.411
percent, $21 billion of 10-year securities at a yield of 2.029
percent and $13 billion of 30-year bonds at 3.248 percent.  Futures traders bet 10-year notes will fall. Hedge-fund
managers and other large speculators  reversed  from a net-long
position to a net-short position in 10-year note futures in the
week ending March 12, according to U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission data.  Speculative short positions, or bets prices will fall,
outnumbered long positions by 57,346 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Last week, traders were net-long 76,818
contracts.  Treasuries due in a decade or more are at the cheapest
levels since 2011 relative to global peers with comparable
maturities, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.
Yields on Treasuries reached 54 basis points higher this week
than those in an index of other sovereign debt, the data showed.
It was the most since August 2011.  China Holdings  China , the largest foreign lender to the U.S., increased
its holdings in Treasuries in January by $44.1 billion, or 3.6
percent, the biggest boost since June 2011, the Treasury
Department reported. The country owns $1.2645 trillion of the
debt, the most since September 2011. As of January, China held
11.4 percent of outstanding marketable  U.S. government debt .  Japan , the second-biggest foreign lender, raised its
holdings of U.S. government debt by $4 billion to $1.1152
trillion, the first increase since October. Japan holds 10
percent of outstanding Treasury debt.  The Fed remains the largest holder of Treasuries, with a
total of $1.767 trillion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
