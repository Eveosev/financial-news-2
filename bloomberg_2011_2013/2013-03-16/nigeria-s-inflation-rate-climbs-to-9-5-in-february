Nigeria ’s  inflation  rate climbed to
9.5 percent in February, the statistics agency said.  Inflation in Africa’s largest oil producer accelerated from
9 percent in January, the Abuja-based  National Bureau of
Statistics  said today in an e-mailed report. The median estimate
of six economists  surveyed  by  Bloomberg News  was 9.6 percent.
Prices rose 0.8 percent in the month.  The Monetary Policy Committee has kept its benchmark
 interest rate  at a record 12 percent for eight consecutive
meetings to curb prices and support the naira. Inflation eased
below 10 percent, meeting the central bank’s target, in January
after a jump in fuel prices in the same month last year fell out
of the calculation. Governor Lamido Sanusi said on Jan. 25 it
will be “very difficult” to keep it at that rate for the rest
of the year.  The MPC will probably hold off on cutting  interest rates 
until it’s sure lower borrowing costs won’t compromise
“achievements” by the bank, Sanusi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
