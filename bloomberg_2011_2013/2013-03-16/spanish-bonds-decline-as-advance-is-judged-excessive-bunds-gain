Spain’s 10-year bonds fell for the
first week in five as some investors judged gains that pushed
yields to the least in more than two years were excessive amid
concern the economy will struggle to grow.  Spain’s 10-year  yields  climbed after reports showed retail
sales slid in January by the most on record and public-sector
debt surged 20 percent last year. German bunds gained after
European Union leaders on March 14 endorsed “structural”
budgetary assessments, using code for granting countries such as
France, Spain and Portugal extra time to bring down deficits.
 Italy ’s bonds were little changed.  “Challenges in Spain remain in terms of the deficit,
prospects for economic growth are not so positive and the high
unemployment rate,” said Alessandro Giansanti, a senior rates
strategist at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam. “We cannot say that
Spain will easily decouple from Italy. The rally has been very
strong, especially the outperformance versus Italy.”  Spain’s 10-year yield climbed 16 basis points, or 0.16
percentage point, in the week to 4.92 percent as of 4:39 p.m.
London time yesterday after falling to 4.70 percent on March 12,
the least since Nov. 22, 2010. The 5.4 percent bond due January
2023 fell 1.27, or 12.70 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to
103.66.  The extra yield that investors demand to hold Spanish 10-
year bonds instead of similar-maturity German bunds widened 23
basis points to 347 basis points. The so-called spread narrowed
to 320 basis points on March 12, the least since March 21, 2012.
 Germany ’s 10-year  yield  fell seven basis points to 1.45 percent.  ECB Program  Spain’s 10-year yield has dropped from a record high 7.75
percent in July, accelerated by the European Central Bank’s
introduction in September of an unlimited debt-purchase program
to cap borrowing costs of highly indebted euro-area nations. The
Iberian nation’s borrowing costs fell at an extraordinary
auction on March 14.  The sale signaled Spain had avoided contamination from the
political fallout of inconclusive elections in Italy, which had
forced the nation’s borrowing costs higher amid concern the
stalemate would deepen the euro-area debt crisis.  The Treasury in  Madrid  is scheduled to sell three- and
nine-month bills on March 19 and bonds maturing between 2015 and
2023 on March 21.  “Spain still has a very large yield spread, which will
keep people reaching for it,” said  Marc Ostwald , a senior rates
strategist at Monument Securities Ltd. in London. “People
managing bond portfolios are not spoiled for choice in where to
pick up some yield. There is not a perception that Spain’s
problems are behind it.”  German Sentiment  German bunds may extend their advance next week as
economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast an index of economic
sentiment in  Europe ’s largest economy will slow in March. The
ZEW Center for Economic Research index of investor and analyst
expectations will ease to 48.1 from a two-year high of 48.2 in
February, the median of 40 economist estimates showed before the
report is released on March 19.  Spanish bonds have returned 3.9 percent this year through
March 14, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian
securities gained 0.1 percent, while Germany’s fell 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
