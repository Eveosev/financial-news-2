Seton Hill University women’s
lacrosse coach Kristina Quigley and her unborn child died in a
bus crash on the way to an NCAA-II match, the school said.  The driver of the bus also was killed yesterday when the
vehicle veered off the Pennsylvania Turnpike and hit a tree,
according to a statement on the website.  The team and coaches were among 23 passengers on the bus
when it crashed on the way to Millersville University, the
 Associated Press  said, citing unnamed people familiar with the
accident. Quigley was about six months pregnant, AP reported.  “The Seton Hill community is mourning the loss of Kristina
Quigley and her unborn son,” Kary Coleman, a spokeswoman for
the Greensburg, Pennsylvania school, said in a statement. “The
university extends deepest sympathy to Quigley’s husband and
family.”  Quigley, 30, was in her second season with the Seton Hill
women’s lacrosse program. She led the team to an 11-6 record in
her first season.  Born in Baltimore, she is survived by her husband Glenn and
son Gavin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
