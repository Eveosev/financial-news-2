New York  Jets cornerback  Darrelle
Revis  earned a $1 million bonus today for being on the National
Football League team’s roster, ESPN said on its website.  The money will count toward the team’s salary cap and the
only way New York could have avoided it was to cut or trade
the three-time All-Pro, ESPN said.  Revis played only two games last season before tearing a
knee ligament and is seeking a contract worth as much as $16
million annually. He’s due to be a free agent after the 2013
season, when he’ll earn $6 million.  The Jets began talking with other teams about trading Revis
during last month’s NFL combine, the New York Daily News
reported at the time. Revis’s contract also contains $1 million
bonuses due in June and July, ESPN said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
