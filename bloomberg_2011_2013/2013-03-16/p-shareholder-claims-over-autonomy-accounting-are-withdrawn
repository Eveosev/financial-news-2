A retirement fund withdrew its
claims against  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) ’s directors and auditors,
along with Autonomy Corp. founder Mike Lynch over alleged
misstatements related to the 2011 purchase of the British
software maker.  The City of Birmingham Retirement and Relief System
voluntarily dismissed its claims in one of at least two so-
called derivative cases filed in federal court in San Jose,
California, on behalf of Hewlett-Packard, according to a filing
today.  Shane P. Sanders, a lawyer who filed the dismissal without
any explanation in the filing, didn’t immediately return a call
after regular business hours seeking comment on it.  Michael Thacker, a spokesman for Palo Alto, California-
based Hewlett-Packard, didn’t immediately return an e-mail after
regular business hours seeking comment.  The case is Ricciardi v. Lynch, 12-cv-06003, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose).  To contact the reporters on this story:
