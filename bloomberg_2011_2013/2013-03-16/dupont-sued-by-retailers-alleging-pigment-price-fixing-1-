DuPont Co. (DD) , the world’s biggest
producer of titanium-dioxide pigment, and three other
manufacturers were accused by retailers in a lawsuit of
conspiring to manipulate prices for the substance.  Los Gatos Ace Hardware in Los Gatos, California, and six
other retailers sued on behalf of a nationwide group of indirect
purchasers of titanium dioxide, an ingredient in white paint.
They claim they paid inflated prices for products containing the
pigment since 2002, according to a complaint filed yesterday in
federal court in  San Jose , California.  DuPont and the other defendants control more than 70
percent of the world’s titanium dioxide capacity and all of the
U.S. capacity, according to the complaint. They increased prices
while demand for the pigment declined, the retailers alleged.
The plaintiffs seek a court order allowing them to sue as a
group and recover triple damages.  “We are reviewing the allegations, and believe they are
similar to claims made in the ongoing antitrust litigation in
this matter,” said  Dan Turner , a DuPont spokesman, in an e-mail
today. “DuPont will continue to defend against these meritless
claims.”  The case is Los Gatos Mercantile Inc. v E.I. DuPont de
Nemours and Co., 13-1180, U.S. District Court, Northern District
of California (San Jose).  To contact the reporter on this story:
