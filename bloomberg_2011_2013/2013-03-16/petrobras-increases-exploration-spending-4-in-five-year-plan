Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , the biggest
oil producer in deep waters, increased investments in
exploration and production and curbed spending on refining in
its 2013-2017 business plan as it develops the largest
discoveries in the Americas in almost four decades.  Petrobras, as the state-controlled company is known,
increased exploration and production spending 4 percent to
$147.5 billion for the five years through 2017 as it adds
equipment to fields in the so-called pre-salt region in deep
waters of the Atlantic Ocean, the company and said in a filing.
It reduced refining investments $700 million to $65.5 billion
because it plans to complete the Abreu e Lima refinery and other
projects in 2016, it said.  Total investments rose 0.5 percent to $236.7 billion
compared with the 2012-2016 plan, it said. Petrobras maintained
its program to more than double oil and natural gas output in
Brazil to 5.2 million barrels a day in 2020.  The Rio de Janeiro-based producer is increasing production
at fields trapped under a layer of salt miles below the Atlantic
seabed in an effort to more than double output by 2020.
Petrobras was expected to announce a modest increase in its
five-year plan to include 2017 investments, Frank McGann, a  Bank
of America (BAC)  Corp. analyst, said in a March 13 research report.  The most indebted publicly-traded oil company is struggling
with the dual priorities of expanding production and keeping
debt low enough to maintain its investment grade rating. The
five-year plan calls for $61.3 billion in borrowing to finance
investments and service its debt.  The company expects cash flow to total $164.7 billion over
the period and it plans to raise an additional $9.9 billion from
asset sales and financial restructuring, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
