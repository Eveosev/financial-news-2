Gabon reversed its decision to
declare force majeure as oil stocks are still available to
continue exports, Petroleum and Energy Minister Etienne Ngoubou
said.  The Central African nation declared force majeure, a legal
clause that allows authorities to miss contracted deliveries due
to circumstances beyond their control, after the National
Organization of Oil Employees, representing about 5,000 industry
workers, started a strike on March 10. It’s protesting the
dismissal of 17  Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB)  staff and the employment of
expatriates in positions that locals are qualified for.  “The oil ministry is taking precautionary measures to
allow the customer to take delivery of the oil despite the
strike,” Ngoubou said in a statement handed to reporters
yesterday in the capital, Libreville.  The strike hasn’t affected oil exports and 80 percent of
the Gabonese market is “covered,” Christophe Akagha Mba,
director general of the government-owned company for storage of
petroleum products, said in a telephone interview from
Libreville today.  “The domestic gas supplies have resumed normal production
at between 50 and 70 tonnes of gas per day,” he said.  Gabon, which produces about 243,000 barrels per day of oil,
said in November 2011 it will regulate employment of foreign
workers in  energy industry .  To contact the reporters on this story:
