Everton, playing with 10 men, beat
Manchester City 2-0, damaging the defending champion’s title
chances in English soccer’s Premier League.  Leon Osman and Nikica Jelavic scored as Everton rebounded
from last weekend’s upset loss to Wigan in the F.A. Cup
quarterfinals.  Steven Pienaar  was sent off for the Toffees after
getting his second yellow card in the 61st minute.  Manchester City remains 12 points behind first-place
Manchester United, which hosts Reading later today, with nine
games remaining in the season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
