Novorossiysk Commercial Sea Port
CEO Rado Antolovic plans to defend himself after Russian
investigators opened a criminal case and searched the company’s
offices.  Antolovic believes the charges are groundless, a
Novorossiysk press official, who asked not to be identified
citing company policy, said by phone today. Antolovic is on a
business trip abroad, meeting with Novorossiysk clients, the
official said.  Investigators seized documents from the port’s offices in
connection with a case against an acting CEO who held the
position in 2011, the Investigative Committee in  Russia ’s
southern Krasnodar region said yesterday on its website. The
suspect wasn’t named.  Antolovic was named acting CEO of the port group in April
2012 and appointed CEO in July, according to the Novorossiysk
official. He has worked at Novorossiysk since April 2011,
according to the company’ website.  A shareholder conflict erupted this year between OAO
Transneft and businessman Ziyavudin Magomedov’s Summa Group over
management of the company, which runs oil terminals on the Black
and Baltic Seas.  In January, Transneft, Russia’s oil pipeline operator,
called for Antolovic to be replaced because of financial and
operational results. The partners settled the dispute, agreeing
to appoint Transneft’s First Vice President Maxim Grishanin as
chairman of the board.  Transneft and Summa own a joint venture that holds a
controlling 50.1 percent of the Novorossiysk port group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
