Dubai Electricity and Water
Authority completed the first phase of a $67 million water
reservoir project in Dubai,  Arabian Business  reported yesterday,
citing Chief Executive Officer Saeed Al Tayer.  The reservoir’s capacity of 120 million gallons (456
million liters) of desalinated water will expand Dubai’s storage
capacity to 790 million gallons, once completed, the newspaper
said.  The state-owned utility said the project will give Dubai a
reserve of water equaling more than 2 1/2 days of consumption in
the second-largest sheikdom in the  United Arab Emirates .  To contact the reporter on this story:
