Max Scherzer fell shy of tying  Roger Clemens ’s record 14-0 start to a Major League Baseball season,
taking his first loss in 21 starts as the Detroit Tigers fell
7-1 to the Texas Rangers.  Scherzer (13-1) allowed four runs and eight hits in six
innings, walking two and striking out six last night for his
first regular-season loss since Sept. 23. Clemens began the 1986
MLB season by winning 14 games without a loss.  The 28-year-old pitcher has struck out at least six batters
in each of his 19 starts this season.  Mitch Moreland hit a two-run homer in the fourth inning for
a 3-0 lead for the Rangers and  Adrian Beltre  added a two-run
homer in the three-run ninth.  Hernan Perez hit a run-scoring single in the fourth for the
Tigers (51-42) at Comerica Park in Detroit.  Derek Holland  (8-4) allowed a run and five hits in seven
innings for the Tigers (54-40).  To contact the reporter on this story:
