Kenny Perry secured his second major
tournament title in a three-week span on golf’s Champions Tour
with a five-stroke win at the U.S. Senior Open.  Perry, 52, shot a 7-under-par 63 during yesterday’s final
round at Omaha Country Club in  Nebraska  to finish with a four-round total of 13-under 267. Fred Funk was second at 8-under
par, one shot better than Rocco Mediate and Corey Pavin.  Perry, who received $500,000 for the victory, also won the
Senior Players Championship two weeks ago for his first major
title on the 50-and-over tour. On the PGA Tour, Perry lost both
the Masters Tournament and the PGA Championship in playoffs.  “To lose a Masters in a playoff and lose a PGA
Championship in a playoff, all I felt was heartbreak,” Perry, a
14-time winner on the PGA Tour, said during a news conference.
“To finally get it all together and to finally have two majors
attached to my name is very sweet.”  Perry is the first golfer to win consecutive majors on the
senior tour since Bernhard Langer in 2010.  Perry will seek a third straight major title later this
month at the Senior British Open Championship at Royal Birkdale
Golf Club in  England .  To contact the reporter on this story:
