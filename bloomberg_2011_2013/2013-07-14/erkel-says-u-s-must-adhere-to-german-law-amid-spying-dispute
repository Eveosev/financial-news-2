Chancellor Angela Merkel  said U.S.
authorities must adhere to Germany’s data-protection law when
operating on German soil as her interior minister came under
fire for defending U.S. surveillance activities.  While Merkel has asserted the need for balance between
security considerations and privacy, Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich returned from a trip to the U.S. yesterday
saying that programs such as the U.S. National Security Agency’s
newly disclosed Prism program have prevented terrorist attacks.  Merkel’s challenger in national elections, which are 10
weeks away, Social Democrat  Peer Steinbrueck , told  Bild
 Friedrich’s visit was a “complete insult.” He also took aim at
the chancellor, suggesting she violated her oath of office to
protect Germans by not preventing the mass surveillance.  “What’s especially important to me is that the American
services conform to German law on German soil,” Merkel told
broadcaster ARD in an interview today. “That will be explored -
- whether that was the case in the past or not.”  Merkel also said Germany would push for a unified European
Union data-protection regulation requiring technology companies
like  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and  Facebook Inc. (FB)  to disclose to whom they
transfer data. She also joined members of her cabinet who have
urged an international treaty to guarantee privacy protection.  To contact the reporter on this story:
