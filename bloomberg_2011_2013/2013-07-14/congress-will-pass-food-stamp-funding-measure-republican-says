The  U.S. Congress  will
“absolutely” fund the federal food stamp program even after
passing a farm-policy bill this month without including money
for food aid for the poor, a Republican lawmaker said today.  “I have never talked to one person that says ‘‘We don’t
want to take care of the most vulnerable,’” Representative Mike Kelly, a Pennsylvania Republican, said on CBS’s “Face the
Nation” program. “But I have talked to people that said the
system’s broken. And when they look at what’s going on, we’re
wasting billions of dollars on a program that doesn’t seem to be
lifting people out of poverty.”  The farm policy legislation that passed the House last week
didn’t include language to renew food-aid programs for the poor.
No Democrats supported the measure, which benefits crop buyers
such as  Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM)  and insurers including  Wells
Fargo & Co. (WFC)   More than 530 groups with a stake in farm policy had urged
House Speaker  John Boehner , an Ohio Republican, in a July letter
not to split food stamps from crop subsidies. Democratic
President Barack Obama’s administration has threatened to veto
the plan were Congress to pass the scaled-back version.  To contact the reporter on this story:
