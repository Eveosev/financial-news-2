Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said  Iran  is moving ahead toward nuclear weapons
capability and warned that his country would act by itself if
necessary to prevent that from happening.  “We’re closer than the United States,” Netanyahu said
today in an interview on CBS-TV’s current affairs program “Face
the Nation,” according to a transcript of his remarks.  “We’re
more vulnerable. And therefore, we’ll have to address this
question of how to stop Iran, perhaps before the United States
does.”  Iranian officials have said the country’s nuclear
facilities are intended only for civilian purposes such as
energy and medical purposes. Netanyahu has said Iran is seeking
to develop nuclear weapons that would pose an “existential
threat” to  Israel  and “all options are on the table” to stop
it, including a military strike.  Iran’s president-elect, Hassan Rohani, has said he would
seek to ease international economic sanctions aimed at
curtailing the development of his country’s nuclear program.
Netanyahu dismissed speculation that Rohani’s victory last month
signals a possible change in Iranian nuclear policy, and urged
the international community to toughen the sanctions.  Rohani’s strategy “is be a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Smile
and build a bomb,” the Israeli leader said on “Face the
Nation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
