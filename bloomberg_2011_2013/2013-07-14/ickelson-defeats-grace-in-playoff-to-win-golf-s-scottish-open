Phil Mickelson  of the U.S. beat
 South Africa ’s Branden Grace in a playoff to win golf’s Scottish
Open today, four days before the British Open at Muirfield.  Both players scored final-round 69s, three under par, to
finish level on 17-under at Castle Stuart, Inverness. Mickelson
three-putted the last regulation hole for a bogey 6 as he missed
a victory chance.  “This is really cool, this golf course is just wonderful,
and to come out on top really means a lot,” Mickelson told  Sky
Sports . “I was so mad at myself for losing my focus,” he said
of the three-putt. “I came out pretty focused” for the
playoff, he added.  The American clinched his first individual win in Britain
at the opening extra hole with a birdie after pitching to within
inches.  Four-time major winner Mickelson, 43, recovered from a
double-bogey six at the first hole today and went on to make
seven birdies in the round.  Denmark’s JB Hansen had a quadruple-bogey nine at the
second hole but rallied to finish joint third with Sweden’s
Henrik Stenson on 15-under.  Mickelson picked up a check for 579,080 euros ($758,000).  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
