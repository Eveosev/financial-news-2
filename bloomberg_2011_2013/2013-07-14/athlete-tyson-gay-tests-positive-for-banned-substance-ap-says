U.S. 100-meter record-holder Tyson Gay tested positive for a banned substance and says he’ll pull
out of next month’s world championships in Moscow, the
 Associated Press  reported.  Gay, who didn’t reveal the substance, said he was notified
by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency two days ago that a sample from a
May 16 out-of-competition test was found to be positive, the AP
added. His “B” sample is yet to be tested, he said.  Gay, 30, was cited as saying in a phone conversation from
Amsterdam, “I don’t have a sabotage story...I basically put my
trust in someone and was let down.”  Gay has run the fastest 100-meter time in the world this
year, 9.75 seconds. Last month he won the 100 meters and 200
meters at the U.S. National Outdoor Championships.  The AP cited USADA as saying it “appreciates his approach
to handling this situation and his choice to voluntarily remove
himself from competition while the full facts surrounding his
test are evaluated.”  It said the “B” sample will be processed shortly, “and
as in all cases all athletes are innocent unless or until proven
otherwise through the established legal process, and any attempt
to sensationalize or speculate is a disservice to due process,
fair play, and to those who love clean sport.”  Max Siegel, chief executive officer of USA Track and Field,
said “we do not know the facts of this case and look to USADA
to adjudicate it and handle it appropriately,” the AP reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
