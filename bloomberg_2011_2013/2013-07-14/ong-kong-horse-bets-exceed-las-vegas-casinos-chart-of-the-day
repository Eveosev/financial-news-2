(Corrects story published July 15 to remove inaccurate
comparison with  Nevada ’s gaming revenue in first three
paragraphs.)  Hong Kong  Jockey Club is seeking to
raise revenue by keeping more Hong Kong residents from taking
the one-hour ferry ride to Macau and through revenue-sharing
agreements, said Chief Executive Officer Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges.  The goal is to lure back about a third of the HK$26 billion
Hong Kong residents bet in Macau the past year, he said in an
interview on July 12.  Hitting that target may not be easy, according to Tim
Craighead, senior gaming analyst at Bloomberg Industries. “I
don’t really consider Macau as having drained the people away
from horse racing,” he said. “It doesn’t seem like there has
really been a growing base of Hong Kongers that have been opting
for Macau compared to the  Jockey Club .”  Engelbrecht-Bresges said another goal is to attract as much
as HK$10 billion of bets on Hong Kong races annually through so-called commingling arrangements with overseas partners. The club
in August 2007 approved a plan to accept bets on its races from
the U.S. through the Nevada Gaming Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
