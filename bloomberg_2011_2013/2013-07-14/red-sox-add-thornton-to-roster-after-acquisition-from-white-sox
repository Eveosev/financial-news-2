The Boston Red Sox added  Matt Thornton  to their active roster last night after acquiring the
left-hander from the Chicago White Sox, General Manager  Ben Cherington  said.  To make room for Thornton on the 25-man roster, right-hander Steven Wright was sent to Triple-A Pawtucket. Left-hander
 Andrew Miller , who suffered a left-foot sprain, was placed on
the 60-day disabled list to open a spot on the 40-man roster.  Thornton, 36, was acquired by the Red Sox along with cash
considerations from White Sox two days ago in exchange for minor
league outfielder  Brandon Jacobs .  In 40 appearances for Chicago this year, he went 0-3 with a
3.86 earned-run average, 10 walks, and 21 strikeouts.  The  Red Sox  were shut out 3-0 last night by the Oakland
Athletics. Boston (58-38) leads the American League East, 3 Â½
games ahead of the Tampa Bay Rays (54-41).  Wright, 28, earned the first win of his major league career
two days ago in a 10-inning game against the Seattle Mariners,
throwing 5 2/3 scoreless innings of relief.  In his two appearances for Boston in 2013, he is 1-0 with a
4.82 ERA, six walks, and seven strikeouts. He rejoins Pawtucket
where he was 4-5 with a 3.81 ERA, 49 walks, and 70 strikeouts in
16 starts. At the time of his promotion to the majors on July 10,
he had thrown 17 2/3 consecutive scoreless innings over his
previous three outings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
