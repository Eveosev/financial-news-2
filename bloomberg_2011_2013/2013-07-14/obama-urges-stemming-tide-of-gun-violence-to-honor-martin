President  Barack Obama  called the
killing of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin “a tragedy” for
America that should lead citizens to ask if they are “doing all
they can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many
lives across this country on a daily basis.”  “We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society,
how we can prevent future tragedies like this,” Obama said in a
statement. “That’s the way to honor Trayvon Martin.”  The president asked that citizens respect the call for calm
made by Martin’s parents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
