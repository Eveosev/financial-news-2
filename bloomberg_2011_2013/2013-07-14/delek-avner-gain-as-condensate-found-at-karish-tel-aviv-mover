Avner Oil Exploration LLP (AVNRL)  and  Delek
Drilling-LP (DEDRL) , partners in the Karish prospect offshore Israel,
gained after the companies said the site is estimated to hold
“significant amounts” of condensate along with natural gas.  Avner gained 1.8 percent, the most since June 25, to 2.607
shekels at the 12:51 p.m in Tel Aviv. Delek Drilling  advanced 
1.8 percent, the most since June 19, to 14.96 shekels.  Delek
Group Ltd. (DLEKG) , which has stakes in Delek Drilling and Avner added
3.1 percent today, bringing its 12-month gain to 77 percent and
giving it the best return of all shares traded on the benchmark
 TA-25 (TA-25)  index for the period.  Delek Drilling and Avner, also partners in the Leviathan
and Tamar natural gas fields, said today that a report from
consultants Netherland Sewell and Associates Inc. shows the
Karish prospect, part of the Alon C license to the northeast of
Tamar, holds about 13 million barrels of condensate.  “Previous estimates for Karish did not account for
quantities of condensate,” Noam Pincu, an analyst at Psagot
Investment House Ltd. in  Tel Aviv  said today by phone. “This is
a nice upside for the partners in the field, especially since
the price of condensate is similar to that of  Brent crude  oil.”  The price of Brent crude rose 1 percent to $108.81 a barrel
on July 12. Delek Drilling and Avner shares have advanced 40
percent and 36 percent, respectively, in the past 12 months as
Israel on March 30 started production of natural gas from Tamar,
estimated to hold 10 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.  The find brings the total amount of condensate at the three
sites to about 60 million barrels, according to an e-mailed
statement from the companies. The report reaffirms  Noble Energy
Inc. (NBL)  estimates of 1.8 trillion cubic feet of gross mean natural
gas at the Karish site, Delek Drilling and Avner also said.  The two companies each hold a 26.5 percent stake in Karish
and Noble a 47 percent interest, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
