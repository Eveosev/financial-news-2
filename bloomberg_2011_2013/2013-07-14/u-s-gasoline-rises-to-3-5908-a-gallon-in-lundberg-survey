(Corrects direction of price change in headline and first
paragraph.)  The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. pumps fell 0.61 cent in the past three weeks to
$3.5908 a gallon, according to Lundberg Survey Inc.  The survey released yesterday covers the period ended July
12 and is based on information obtained at about 2,500 filling
stations by the Camarillo, California-based company.  The average, which reached a year-to-date peak of $3.795 in
the period ended Feb. 22, was about 18.05 cents above the year-earlier price of $3.4103 a gallon.  “World geopolitics has added risk to oil, raising
prices,”  Trilby Lundberg , president of Lundberg Survey, said
yesterday in a telephone interview. “U.S. refiners have passed
oil price hikes through to their jobbers and retailers, mostly
in the past three days, so that moderate price hikes at the pump
are imminent.”  The highest price for gasoline in the lower 48 U.S. states
among the markets surveyed was in Chicago, where the average
fell 19.82 cents in the past three weeks to $4.04 a gallon,
Lundberg said.  The lowest price was in Charleston,  South Carolina , where
customers paid an average of $3.22 a gallon. Regular gasoline
averaged $3.77 a gallon on  Long Island ,  New York , and $4.02 in
 Los Angeles .  Stockpiles Fall  Gasoline futures  on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  rose
35.58 cents, or 13 percent, to $3.1175 a gallon in the three
weeks to July 12.  U.S. gasoline stockpiles  fell 2.63 million barrels in the
week ended July 5 to 221 million, the least since May 31 and
biggest drop since April 19, according to data from the Energy
Information Administration, the statistical arm of the Energy
Department.  West Texas Intermediate oil on the Nymex rose $12.26, or 13
percent, to $105.95 a barrel in the three weeks ended July 12.  Crude  inventories  fell 20.2 million barrels to 373.9
million in the two weeks ended July 5. Inventories at Cushing,
 Oklahoma , the delivery point for WTI, dropped 2.69 million
barrels, or 5.4 percent, to 47 million. That’s the largest one-week decline since Sept. 25, 2009.  WTI may climb this week after U.S. supplies tumbled and
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  called for maintaining
stimulus, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Twenty-one of 42 analysts, or 50 percent, forecast crude
will increase through July 19. Eighteen respondents, or 43
percent, predicted a decline. Three expected no change.  To contact the reporters on this story:
