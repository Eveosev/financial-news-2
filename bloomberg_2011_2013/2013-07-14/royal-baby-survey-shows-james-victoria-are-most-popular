James and Victoria are the two most
popular names among the U.K. public for the Duke and Duchess of
Cambridgeâ€™s baby, who will be third in line to the throne, the
Sunday Times reported, citing a survey.  Twelve percent of the 1,800 respondents would prefer
Victoria if the baby is a girl and 19 percent opted for James if
the duchess has a boy. The second most popular names were Diana
and George, the newspaper said.  Ladbrokes Plc (LAD) , a U.K. operator of more than 2,000 betting
shops, has offered odds of 500 to 1 that the baby will be called
Elvis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
