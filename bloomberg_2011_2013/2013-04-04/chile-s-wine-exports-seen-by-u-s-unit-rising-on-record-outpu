Chile’s wine exports will keep
expanding this year with production at a record, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture’s  Foreign Agricultural Service  said.  Output last year jumped 20 percent to 1.255 million liters,
an all-time high, and prices paid to producers climbed 20
percent, the FAS said in a report on the USDA website. Supply
may be peaking because 95 percent of the planted area is in full
production, it said. Chile was the seventh largest wine producer
last year, with 8,000 farmers and a planted area that has
expanded 70 percent in the past eight years, the FAS said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
