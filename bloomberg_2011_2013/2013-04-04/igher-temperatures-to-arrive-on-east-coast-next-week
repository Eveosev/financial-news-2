Temperatures may rise into the 60s
and 70s Fahrenheit (15 to 21 Celsius) along the East Coast to
start next week, according to  Matt Rogers , president of
Commodity Weather Group LLC.  There’s a chance the warming will be short lived, as storms
and a cold front may follow by week’s end, he said.  “The latest modeling continues to debate the details of
next week’s weather on the East Coast with an unfortunately wide
range of outcome potential,” Rogers, who’s based in Bethesda,
Maryland, said in a note to clients.  April, the first full month of the Northern Hemisphere
spring, is the start of a transition to warmer weather, when
more energy is used to cool, rather than heat, homes. Until heat
builds in the summer, the impact of the weather on energy prices
is less noticeable. About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas
for warmth.  Rogers predicts temperatures April 9 to 13 will average out
to near-seasonal in the Northeast and will be about 5 degrees
warmer than normal from  North Carolina  to Florida.  MDA Weather Services  forecasts that the East Coast as a
whole will be 3 to 4 degrees warmer than normal in the same
period, with the possibility that coastal North Carolina and
 South Carolina  will be 8 to 14 degrees above normal.  The normal average temperature on April 11 in  New York  City
is 51 degrees Fahrenheit (11 Celsius), according to MDA in
Gaithersburg, Maryland. In Boston, it’s 47; in Chicago, 47; in
Houston, 69; in  St. Louis , 56; and in Burbank, California, 62.  To contact the reporter on this story:
