President  Dennis Lockhart  said while he “wouldn’t totally”
rule out ending or curbing bond buying as soon as this summer,
he wants evidence economic growth is intact before doing so.  “We need a few more months of really solid data and solid
evidence that the recovery is moving ahead,” Lockhart said
today in a CNBC interview. “If you remember the last two years,
we’ve had strong first quarter, which I think we will certainly
get when the numbers come out, followed by kind of a swoon in
the middle of the year. I really want to get beyond that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
