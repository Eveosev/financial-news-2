Brazil ’s swap rates dropped from a
two-week high on speculation stalled economic growth will
prevent the central bank from raising borrowing costs.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 fell four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 8.51 percent at 10:11
a.m. in Sao Paulo after climbing yesterday to 8.55 percent, the
highest level since March 21. The real appreciated 0.2 percent
to 2.0213 per dollar.  “The market is giving back some of the increase from
yesterday,”  Jankiel Santos , the chief economist at Banco
Espirito Santo de Investimento in Sao Paulo, said in a phone
interview. “The market doesn’t know with certainty what the
central bank is going to do, so the swap rates are volatile.”  Swap rates rose yesterday on central bank President
Alexandre Tombini’s comments this week that board members will
wait for March inflation figures due to be released next week
and other data before deciding on the next policy steps.  Minutes of the central bank’s March 5-6 meeting indicated
that an increase in the target lending rate from a record low
7.25 percent wasn’t imminent as policy makers said “a cautious
management of monetary policy” was needed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
