Union Fenosa Gas SA has begun
negotiations with Egyptian authorities to get the country to
resume natural-gas shipments to its liquefaction plant on the
Mediterranean coast after a four-month suspension.  Fenosa, a joint venture between Spain’s  Gas Natural SDG SA (GAS) 
and Rome-based  Eni SpA (ENI) , filed a formal complaint to the
government in February after  Egypt  stopped supplying the
facility. The action  “helped local authorities take matters
seriously” and has spurred talks, Julio Cesar Gutierrez, a
spokesman for Fenosa, said today by telephone.  The plant exports gas to Spain and other countries and can
process 7.56 billion cubic meters of the fuel a year. It’s 80
percent-owned by Union Fenosa Gas. The remaining 20 percent is
held by Egyptian state companies, according to the venture’s
 website .  Egypt’s oil minister, Osama Kamal, said today that Fenosa
may resort to international arbitration if the government
continues to be unable to supply the Damietta plant, according
to the state-run news website Ahram Gate, citing comments from
Anadolu Turkish state news agency.  The Arab world’s most populous nation halted supply to
Fenosa’s Damietta plant to retain more of the fuel for local
use. The North African country, which has exported about a
quarter of its gas output in recent years, is now curtailing
shipments as production ebbs and demand from power plants soars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
