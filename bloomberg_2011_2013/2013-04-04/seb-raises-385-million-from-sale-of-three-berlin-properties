SEB Asset Management AG (S3EA)  raised about
300 million euros ($385 million) selling a hotel in the
Potsdamer Platz complex and two other buildings in Berlin for
its ImmoInvest fund, which is due to be dissolved in 2017.  Al Faisal Holding Co., a privately held company based in
Doha, Qatar, bought the Grand Hyatt hotel on Potsdamer Platz and
the Maritim hotel in the Tiergarten district, Frankfurt-based
SEB said in a statement after the market closed yesterday. A
real estate fund provider in Berlin, which SEB didnâ€™t name,
acquired an office building in the Mitte district, according to
the statement.  ImmoInvest will be wound up after investors asked for
redemptions that exceeded its liquidity. ImmoInvest is the
largest of seven German mutual funds that have been forced to
liquidate after failing to meet invest redemption requests.  The fund has paid out more than 20 percent of its assets to
investors and plans to distribute more money later this year,
SEB said yesterday. The company announced the sale of the Grand
Hyatt in February, without disclosing the price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
