The main coffee region in Vietnam,
the biggest producer of the robusta variety used by  Nestle SA (NESN)  in
instant drinks, may get rain in the first 10 days of April,
potentially easing a drought.  Growing areas in Dak Lak province, which represents about
30 percent of the harvest, will receive 15 millimeters to 25
millimeters through April 10, according to the Meteorology and
Hydrology Department. Water levels in rivers and streams will be
lower than average in previous years, it said in a report. The
government said Feb. 26 that drought would hurt the crop.  Improving weather may push down robusta prices, which
dropped 6 percent to $2,082 a metric ton from a five-month high
in March. Futures will trade from $1,900 to $2,100 a ton this
month,  Edward Meir , an analyst at INTL FCStone said April 2. The
harvest from October will fall at least 10 percent and may drop
as much as 30 percent because of dry weather, according to a
Bloomberg survey published March 15. Output was 1.44 million
tons a year earlier, a separate survey showed.  “Rain helped ease the drought in some areas,” said Nguyen
Dai Nguong, head of the meteorology department. “Some districts
are still dry and the situation remains difficult.”  Robusta for July delivery gained 1.2 percent on NYSE Liffe
in  London  yesterday. Futures advanced to $2,216 a ton on March
13, the highest since Oct. 3, on concern a smaller crop in
 Vietnam  would cut supplies from  Asia  where exports from
 Indonesia , the third-largest shipper, were already falling
because of higher domestic consumption.  Rain Needed  Rainfall recorded at 10 stations monitored by the Dak Lak
weather office, including one in neighboring Dak Nong province,
averaged 15.96 millimeters in the last 11 days of March, the
report showed. While that’s more than the 5.75 millimeters in
the 10 days through March 20, it’s less than the 37.18
millimeters in the last 11 days of March in 2012, according to
the department’s data.  “Rain watered trees and got absorbed into the ground, but
was not enough to increase water levels in reservoirs yet,”
said Dang Huu Hung, a farmer in Krong Nang district. “Whether
it will continue to rain or not, I’ll have to irrigate the trees
and put in fertilizer this month to help fruits develop.”  Trees usually flower from January and most would have
formed fruit by now, according to growers. Beans in  Dak Lak 
traded at 42,500 dong ($2.03) a kilogram on April 2, up 11
percent this year. Robusta’s  discount  to the more expensive
arabica, brewed b y Starbucks Corp ., is about 45.01 cents a pound
after it shrank 20 percent this year and 61 percent in 2012.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
