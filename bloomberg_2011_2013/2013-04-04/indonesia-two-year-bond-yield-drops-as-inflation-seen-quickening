Indonesia’s two-year bonds advanced,
with the yield dropping by the most this year, amid speculation
investors are favoring short-term notes on concern a plan to
adjust fuel subsidies will spur inflation. The rupiah fell.  The government may need to raise the cost of subsidized
fuel, with a 10 percent increase in April being the most
feasible option, Bambang Brodjonegoro, head of fiscal policy at
the finance ministry, said in an interview yesterday. Inflation,
which reached a 22-month high of  5.9 percent  in March, could
accelerate to 8 percent if there is a price rise,  Destry Damayanti , chief economist at PT Bank Mandiri, said yesterday.  “Investors seek safety in the shorter tenors as they are
less sensitive to price gains,” said Herdi Wibowo, head of debt
capital markets in Jakarta at PT BCA Sekuritas, a unit of the
nation’s largest bank by market value. “The market has begun to
price in expected inflation from the planned fuel adjustments.”  The yield on the government’s 11 percent bonds due October
2014 fell eight basis points to 4.33 percent as of 3:19 p.m. in
Jakarta, the biggest drop since Dec. 21, according to prices
from the Inter Dealer Market Association. The yield on the
benchmark bonds due May 2023 was little changed at 5.52 percent.  Indonesia  may sell a new type of subsidized fuel at 7,000
rupiah a liter, compared with the current variety sold at 4,500
rupiah per liter by state-owned PT Pertamina, Firmanzah, a
senior staff member for economic affairs in the president’s
office, said in Jakarta today. Like many Indonesians, he goes by
only one name.  Rupiah, Volatility  The rupiah declined 0.2 percent to 9,762 per dollar, prices
from local banks compiled by Bloomberg show. The 9,700 level may
best reflect fundamentals, where the rate should promote exports
and discourage unnecessary imports, the finance ministry’s
Brodjonegoro said yesterday.  The spot rate traded at a 0.6 percent premium to the one-
month non-deliverable forwards, which weakened 0.4 percent to
9,825, data compiled by Bloomberg show. A daily  fixing  used to
settle the derivatives was set at 9,752 by the Association of
Banks in  Singapore , from 9,742 yesterday.  One-month implied volatility for the rupiah, a measure of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
dropped 16 basis points, or 0.16 percentage point, to 5.97
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
