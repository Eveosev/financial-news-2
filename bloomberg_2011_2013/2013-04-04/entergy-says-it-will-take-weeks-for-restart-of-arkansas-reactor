Entergy Corp. (ETR)  said it will take
several weeks to restart a Arkansas reactor unit that was
tripped offline after an accident at the facility that killed
one person and injured eight.  The utility’s Arkansas Nuclear One’s Unit 2 has been shut
since March 31 after a 550-ton generator component fell as it
was being moved out of a turbine building at Unit 1, the New
Orleans-based company said in a statement.  A new generator component that is scheduled for
installation at Unit 1 is being staged at an offsite location,
the company said. The accident was associated with a Unit 1
refueling outage, which began on March 24. Further evaluation
will be needed to asses the damage to Unit 1, the company said.  The plant is located about 65 miles northwest of  Little
Rock .  To contact the reporter on this story:
