A U.S. decision on whether to allow
oil exports would be “very helpful,” amid constraints on spare
production capacity, according to the International Energy
Agency.  Global oil markets face a “zone of tension” because of
limited amounts of unused crude that can be tapped in case of
supply disruptions, IEA Executive Director Maria van der Hoeven
said at a conference in Paris today. The pressure could be eased
if the U.S., which largely prohibits shipment of its oil, makes
a decision on whether to change its policy, van der Hoeven said.  “There is a zone of tension that has to do with spare
capacity, that needs to be bigger,” van der Hoeven told
reporters at the International Oil Summit in Paris. “I hope
that the United States is going to make a decision on exports,”
which “would be very helpful.”  The main obstacles to shipments from the U.S. are
transportation capacity and granting export licenses, van der
Hoeven said.  Any decision on the U.S. exporting its crude is ultimately
one for that nation to determine, van der Hoeven said. The U.S.
is one of the IEA’s 28 member nations.  To contact the reporters on this story:
