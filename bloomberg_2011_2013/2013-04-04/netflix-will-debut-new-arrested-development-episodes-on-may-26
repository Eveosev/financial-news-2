Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , the largest video-
streaming service, will begin airing 15 new episodes of the
comedy “Arrested Development” on May 26, reviving a cult
favorite that was canceled by Fox seven years ago.  All of the episodes will be available to watch immediately
when the show debuts, Netflix said today in a statement,
repeating a strategy it used with “House of Cards,” a drama
the company began airing in February.  “Arrested Development,” which starred  Jason Bateman  as
the scion of the bumbling Bluth family, aired for three seasons
on Fox. The show, created by Mitch Hurwitz, didn’t drew large
ratings, though it was critically acclaimed and attracted an
online following that has continued to grow. In March, readers
of the Vulture entertainment website  voted it  the best sitcom of
the past 30 years, beating out “The Simpsons.”  “‘Arrested Development’ is now widely viewed as one of the
top TV comedies of all time and Mitch Hurwitz is bringing it to
Netflix in a brand new way, crafted for the on-demand generation
that has come to discover the show in the years since it last
appeared on TV,”  Ted Sarandos , chief content officer for Los
Gatos, California-based Netflix, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
