West Texas Intermediate crude traded
near a two-week low, headed for its biggest weekly drop since
September, before U.S. March payroll data later today.  WTI futures in  New York  are poised for a 4.5 percent loss
from the March 28 close, the most since the week ended Sept. 21.
World powers and  Iran  started two-day talks in  Kazakhstan  on
 Iran’s nuclear program . U.S. monthly jobs data will be released
at 8:30 a.m. New York time today. Declines in London’s Brent
crude may be “overdone,” according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  “Selling is coming in ahead of the U.S. data, as we are
having  risk aversion ,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity
strategy at Saxo Bank A/S in Copenhagen.  WTI for May delivery was at $92.89 a barrel in electronic
trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , down 37 cents, at
12:27 p.m. London time. It fell 1.3 percent to $93.26 yesterday,
the lowest settlement since March 21.  Brent for May settlement on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange was at $105.80 a barrel, down 54 cents. It
slipped 0.7 percent to $106.34 yesterday, the lowest close since
Nov. 2. The futures have fallen 11 percent from this year’s
intraday peak of $119.17 on Feb. 8.  “The market has been a bit negative about payroll figures
coming later today, and the surprise could be more on the
upside,” said Thina Saltvedt, an analyst at Nordea Bank AG in
Oslo.  Atlantic Spread  The European benchmark grade was at a $12.91 premium to
WTI, versus $13.08 yesterday. The spread shrank to $12.66 on
April 3, the narrowest since July.  Brent may recover from the recent sell-off as global
inventories will remain low and economic growth picks up in the
second half of the year, Goldman Sachs said in an April 4
report. The bank maintained its second-quarter price projection
at $110 a barrel.  U.S. jobless claims rose by 28,000 in the week to March 30
to 385,000, the Labor Department said yesterday. The  median 
economist estimate was 353,000, according to a Bloomberg News
survey. The country may have added 190,000 new jobs in March,
according to a separate survey before payroll data to be
released today. That would be down from 236,000 in February.  The volume of WTI contracts traded was 14 percent below the
100-day average while Brent was 27 percent above.  Iran Talks  International negotiators from the U.S., Britain,  France ,
 Germany ,  Russia  and  China  are holding nuclear-program talks with
Iran today in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Early last year, tensions with
Iran contributed to higher  oil prices  and a European Union
embargo that started in July has curbed the country’s ability to
export crude.  EU foreign policy chief  Catherine Ashton  said in a
statement the group was looking for “a considered, balanced and
well thought-out response” from Iran on its nuclear program.  Crude will probably fall next week on signs economic growth
is slowing, a Bloomberg survey showed. Fourteen of 26 analysts
and traders, or 54 percent, forecast WTI will drop through April
12. Eight respondents, or 31 percent, predicted a gain and four
said there will be little change. Last week, 50 percent of
survey respondents projected a decrease.  Several North Sea oil-loading programs are being released
to traders today, detailing the likely supply for next month.
The Brent and Oseberg programs show an increase while exports of
the Ekofisk grade will fall, they show. A potential strike may
close some Norwegian platforms on April 8.  Stockpiles High  U.S. crude stockpiles climbed by 2.71 million barrels last
week to 388.6 million, the highest since 1990, the Energy
Information Administration, the Energy Department’s statistics
unit, reported on April 3. That’s more than a 2.1 million median
increase predicted by analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Oil demand will be “less than it was before” in the next
few months, Maria van der Hoeven, the executive director of the
 International Energy Agency , said yesterday in a Bloomberg
Television interview. “That will help, we hope, to loosen the
tightness of the market.”  The  IEA ’s next monthly market report will be published on
April 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
