A Davos conference panelist, a Picasso dwarf, and dancing monks are among Muse’s arts and leisure recommendations for  London  this weekend.  STAGE  Playwright Bruce Norris is in two places this weekend.  At the Gate Theatre is his “Purple Heart,” about a Vietnam War widow who lives with her teenage son and nosy mother-in-law, and receives a visit from a veteran with a prosthetic hand. Ends April 6:  http://www.gatetheater.co.uk  or call +44-20-7229-0706.  At the  Royal Court  is the new Norris play “The Low Road,” a critique of capitalism staged by the theater’s departing artistic director Dominic Cooke. It fast-forwards from colonial America to Davos, where a banker praises greed in a panel. Ends May 11:  http://www.royalcourttheatre.com  or +44-20-7565-5000.  DINING  If you’re at the  Barbican cinemas  this weekend, there’s a new place to eat next door:  Cote , inspired by Paris bistros. The food is good, and the prices reasonable. A main of linguine with seafood, for instance, costs 11.95 pounds ($18). Information:  http://www.cote-restaurants.co.uk .  Trinity would be a good restaurant anywhere, and is particularly welcome in Clapham. It’s been a neighborhood favorite since opening in 2006. Chef Adam Byatt is known for the quality of his cooking and ingredients. Sunday lunch is 42 pounds for three courses:  http://www.trinityrestaurant.co.uk .  VISUAL ARTS  As a 20-year-old, Picasso was confident and prolific.  “Yo Picasso” (1901) is the title he gave a self-portrait that’s now in private hands and hangs in the  Courtauld Gallery  through May 27. “Becoming Picasso: Paris 1901” -- focusing on his output that year -- features the flaming-orange picture of a performing dwarf (“Nana”), and brooding Blue Period canvases inspired by his friend’s suicide in a Montmartre café after he was spurned by a certain Germaine. Information:  http://www.courtauld.ac.uk  or +44-20-7848-2526.  For earlier Iberian art, visit the dim Sevillan church interior recreated by the Dulwich Picture Gallery for its Bartolome Esteban Murillo exhibition. Ends May 19:  http://www.dulwichpicturegallery.org.uk  or +44-20-8639-5254.  MUSIC  Laura Mvula, the classically trained singer who has turned to soul, plays a date at the Wiltons  Music Hall  April 5 before heading to the U.S. for the release of her album.  The following night at the same venue, Londoners get a rare chance to hear Dexys, the band which returned after 27 years with the acclaimed “One Day I’m Going to Soar.” Kevin Rowland’s troupe is playing the new album all the way through and following it with older songs such as “Come on Eileen.”  April 5 and 6 at Wilton’s Music Hall, 1-4 Graces Alley, off Ensign St, E1 8JB.
