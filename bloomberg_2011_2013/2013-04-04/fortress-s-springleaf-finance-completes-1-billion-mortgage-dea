Springleaf Finance Corp., the
subprime lender that’s been raising cash to repay maturing debt
by packaging older mortgages into bonds, sold home-loan notes in
a $1 billion securitization.  A $500.7 million slice of the transaction granted AAA
ratings by  Standard & Poor’s  priced to yield 1.23 percent, or
0.85 percentage point more than benchmark rates, a person
familiar with the offering said. The notes have a projected
average life of 1.85 years and 51 percent of credit enhancement,
or buffer against losses on the underlying loans, according to
the person, who asked not to be identified because they weren’t
authorized to speak about the transaction.  The company, which is mostly owned by Fortress Investment
Group LLC, completed $3 billion of securitizations tied to older
mortgages in four transactions in 2011 and 2012, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The Evansville, Indiana-based
lender’s corporate bonds have been the best performing this year
among the top 50 U.S. high-yield issuers.  Springleaf sold $604 million of bonds backed by subprime
personal loans in February, the first deal of its type in at
least 10 years. The firm exited real-estate lending at the start
of last year to focus on other consumer financing and its
insurance operations. Bank of America Corp. and Credit Suisse
Group AG managed its latest offering, the person said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
