Vale SA (VALE5) , the world’s biggest iron-
ore producer, slumped the most in eight months after Brazil’s
Supreme Court postponed a ruling that may free the company from
a $15.1 billion tax payment.  Vale  slumped  4 percent to 32.36 reais at the close in Sao
Paulo today, the most since July 24. The Rio de Janeiro-based
company, which traded at 1.1 times its three-month average
volume, was the second-worst performer among  15 mining companies 
tracked by Bloomberg.  The Supreme Court yesterday  postponed  until April 10 a vote
on the constitutionality of taxing Brazilian companies on
foreign units’ profits, after two justices issued their votes.
While the final outlook will probably be positive for Vale,
investors may take profits given the case’s lack of resolution,
Bank of America Corp. analysts led by Felipe Hirai in Sao Paulo
said in a note to clients yesterday.  “The final ruling form the Supreme Court should only come
next week, when the trial resumes,” the analysts wrote.  Brazil  is demanding Vale to pay 30.5 billion reais ($15.1
billion) in foreign units tax for 1996 to 2008, the company said
April 2 in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. Vale expects the country to file additional claims
for the subsequent years, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
