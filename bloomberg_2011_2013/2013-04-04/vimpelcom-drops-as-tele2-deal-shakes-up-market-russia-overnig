Russia’s biggest telecommunications
companies plunged on concern they risk losing market share
should government-run OAO Rostelecom gain  Tele2 AB (TEL2B) ’s business in
the country.  OAO MegaFon (MFON) , Russia’s second-largest mobile-phone operator,
slid the most on record in London, while  OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) ,
the No. 1 provider known as MTS, sank to the lowest level since
Jan. 30 in New York and declined as much as 4.7 percent in
Moscow.  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) , the third-biggest, rebounded 1.2 percent
in U.S. trading, trimming its first decline in three weeks.  MTS and VimpelCom joined forces last week to try and trump
state-run Russian lender VTB Group’s deal to buy Tele2’s
business in the country. Stockholm-based Tele2 said yesterday
that it completed the sale to VTB and analysts including
Alexander Kazbegi at Renaissance Capital said that the
government may combine Tele2 Russia with Rostelecom, the
nation’s biggest fixed-line phone operator.  “This puts downside risk to all Big-3 players and MegaFon
in particular,” Luis Saenz, head of equity sales at BCS
Financial Group in London, wrote in an e-mailed note. “The end
game that has been circulating in the market is a new mobile
operator.”  A merger would give Rostelecom 36.3 million mobile
subscribers, based on fourth-quarter data from Advanced
Communications & Media, compared with 56 million for VimpelCom.
VimpelCom, which has been expanding abroad, lost its position as
Russia’s No. 2 mobile provider in 2010 and is lagging behind the
others in rolling out fourth-generation wireless services.  ‘Lower Prices’  “If Tele2 is merged with Rostelecom, which I expect will
happen within the next six to nine months, major players in the
mobile phone market will be forced to lower prices and revenue
will suffer,” Kazbegi, a telecommunications analyst at
Renaissance, said by phone from Moscow yesterday. “VimpelCom
will probably suffer the most because it has already been losing
its market share and didn’t invest enough.”  Kazbegi rates VimpelCom hold and is ranked first among 22
analysts who cover the company after his recommendations on the
stock delivered the best total returns -- at 18.4 percent --over
the past year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  VimpelCom and MTS offered Tele2 a premium of about 30
percent to VTB’s deal March 28. The lender agreed to buy Tele2
Russia for $3.55 billion in cash and debt.  Rostelecom Talks  VTB is in talks with Arkady Rotenberg, an investor in
Rostelecom, to set up a joint venture with Tele2 Russia, the
Vedomosti newspaper reported today, citing people it didn’t
identify. A joint venture would create Russia’s fourth-largest
mobile operator and Rostelecom has both 3G and 4G licenses,
Vedomosti said.  Rotenberg’s spokesman, who Vedomosti didn’t identify,
declined to comment. VTB’s spokesman said that the lender is not
in talks about Tele2 Russia partnerships, though it is open to
“collaboration with any market players, both Russian and
foreign,” according to the report.  Bobby Leach, a spokesman for VimpelCom based in Amsterdam,
had no comment on whether the company will oppose the VTB
takeover. MTS plans to fight the purchase, Michael Hecker, vice
president for strategy at the company, said by phone this week.  “It is too early to speculate on any potential future
owner or what this might do to the market,” Leach said by e-
mail yesterday.  4G Licenses  VimpelCom lost subscribers in Russia in two out of four
quarters of last year, according to Advanced Communications &
Media data. The Russian subscriber tally for Moscow-based MTS
rose 0.7 percent from the third quarter to 71 million, while
VimpelCom’s slipped 0.1 percent in the last three months of
2012, the data show.  MTS, VimpelCom, MegaFon and Rostelecom won 4G wireless
licenses in July. While MegaFon offers 4G services in cities
including Moscow and St. Petersburg, VimpelCom will roll out 4G
by June, according to its website. Tele2 failed to win a 4G
license.  Rostelecom dropped 1 percent to 118.18 rubles, or $3.74 in
Moscow today, while MegaFon was down 9.1 percent to $26.96 in
London, the steepest one-day slump since the company’s November
listing.  Shares of MTS fell 3.4 percent to 261.10 rubles, or $8.26,
on Moscow’s Micex Index, and the provider’s American depositary
receipts lost 1.1 percent to $19.64 in New York. Each ADR is
equal to two shares. VimpelCom erased an earlier decline of as
much as 1.2 percent to end the U.S. day 1.2 percent higher at
$11.69. The ADRs fell 1.7 percent this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
