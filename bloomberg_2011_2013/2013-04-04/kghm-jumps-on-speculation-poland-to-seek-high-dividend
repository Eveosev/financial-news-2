KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH) , Poland’s sole
copper and silver producer, climbed for the first time this week
on speculation the government will seek a “high” dividend to
help narrow its budget deficit.  The  shares  advanced as much as 2.8 percent and traded 1.5
percent higher at 157.5 zloty at 2:17 p.m. in Warsaw, heading
for the highest close since March 21 and valuing the state-
controlled company at 31.8 billion zloty ($9.7 billion).  The government “takes into account a dividend higher than
30 percent” of profit, Deputy Treasury Minister Pawel Tamborski
told reporters today. KGHM should pay out at least 30 percent of
its 4.87 billion-zloty ($1.5 billion) profit, Parkiet reported
on Feb. 18, citing Treasury Minister Mikolaj Budzanowski. Only
once in the  last eight years  has the government approved
management’s proposal on dividend size. The dividend proposal
hasn’t been presented yet.  “The government is under bigger pressure than in past
years to get high dividends because of budget needs,”
Bartlomiej Kubicki, a Vienna-based analyst at Raiffeisen
Centrobank AG, said by e-mail today. “I expect 60 percent of
last year’s profit to be paid out.”  The budget gap probably reached about 25 billion zloty in
the first quarter of the year, Deputy Finance Minister Hanna
Majszczyk said today. That would account for 70 percent of the
goverment’s full-year target as the slowing economy cuts tax
revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
