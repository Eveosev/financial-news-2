The possibility of a general strike
by U.K. workers grew as  Unison , representing 1.3 million public-
sector employees, said it might support plans by another union
to protest Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s austerity measures.  The proposed 24-hour walkout would be the first time since
1926 that private and public-sector workers have taken
coordinated action on such a large scale. The Unite union, which
represents 1.5 million workers, some in the private sector,
proposed the strike, which will be debated at a meeting of the
 Trades Union Congress , the umbrella labor movement, on April 24.  A spokeswoman for Unison said today the union would
consider a general strike as a tactic that should be used at the
end of a long campaign of other protests, such as marches. There
would be considerable legal hurdles to overcome before a general
strike could be called, the spokeswoman, who declined to be
named, said by telephone.  Last October, tens of thousands of people marched in
 London , Glasgow and  Belfast  to protest the coalition
government’s austerity measures. With Chancellor of the
Exchequer  George Osborne  asking government departments to find
11.5 billion pounds ($17.3 billion) of further savings in the
fiscal year 2015-16, spending cuts will only deepen. Two days
ago, Unite dubbed Osborne an “ economic Dracula ” who only
“emerges to suck more life out of the economy.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
