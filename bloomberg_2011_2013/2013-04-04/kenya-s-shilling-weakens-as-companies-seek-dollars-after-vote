Kenya ’s shilling weakened as
businesses sought dollars to restart operations after the
country’s  Supreme Court  upheld Uhuru Kenyatta’s election win.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy depreciated
0.2 percent to 84.90 per dollar by 5:44 p.m. in Nairobi, the
capital, the first decline since March 26.  “Businesses will start placing their orders for dollars as
they seek to ramp up production and the shilling may weaken
further,” John Muli, a dealer at Nairobi-based African Banking
Corp., said by phone.  The shilling gained earlier this week after the court
unanimously confirmed that Kenyatta won the March 4 vote. It
rejected a petition from runner-up  Raila Odinga , who argued that
the electoral process had been marred by irregularities and
fraud.  “The shilling is reaping from the peaceful conclusion of
the elections, which has removed the political risks that were
there earlier,” Finance Minister Robinson Githae told reporters
today in Nairobi.  The  Central Bank  of Kenya took all 9.85 billion shillings
($116 million) in bids for seven-day and 14-day term-auction
deposits, according to an official at the institution who asked
not to be identified in line with policy. The bank, which had
offered 15 billion shillings, uses the securities to reduce
 money supply  and support the shilling.  Uganda’s currency weakened 0.3 percent to 2,597 per dollar,
while the Tanzanian shilling gained 0.3 percent to 1,620 against
the U.S. unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
