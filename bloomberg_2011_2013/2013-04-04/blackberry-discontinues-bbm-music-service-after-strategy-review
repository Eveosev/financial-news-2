BlackBerry, the Canadian smartphone
maker, is scrapping paid music-sharing service BBM Music in June
following a review of its strategy.  BBM Music, which cost $4.99 a month, will be discontinued
on June 2, and subscribers will be given 30 days free access to
the RDIO music service, the Waterloo, Ontario-based company said
today in an e-mail. BlackBerry didn’t elaborate on why the
service, which began in August 2011, was shutting down or
whether it was profitable.  The company formerly known as  Research In Motion Ltd. (BB)  has
cut 5,000 jobs and shut down six of 10 manufacturing sites in
the past year to restore profitability as sales continue to
fall. BlackBerry last week reported a surprise profit and said
it expects to be about break-even this quarter, helped by the
cost reductions and demand for the new BlackBerry Z10 phone.  BBM Music, which allows users to share music through the
BlackBerry Messenger instant-messaging platform, competed with
free services like Spotify Ltd. and  Pandora Media Inc. (P)  that
allow users to listen to a selection of songs interspersed with
advertising. It planned to rely on its BBM users, which then
numbered 45 million, and deals with record labels to build a
catalog of 10 million songs in the service. BBM now has 60
million instant-messaging users.  The new BlackBerry 10 operating system enables developers
to bring “very rich music and multimedia apps and services to
customers,” the company said.  BlackBerry was little changed at $14.99 at the close in  New
York . The stock has climbed 26 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
