BG Group Plc (BG/) ’s former Chief
Executive Officer Frank Chapman and  executive directors  skipped
bonuses in relation to last year’s performance after production
targets were missed.  BG fell by a record 14 percent on Oct. 31, when it said
output wouldn’t grow in 2013 because of project delays in the
North Sea, U.S., Brazil and  Egypt . Chapman was replaced by Chris Finlayson this year.  After the “share price fall in the final quarter of the
year, it would be inappropriate” for directors “to be
considered for a bonus in respect of 2012,” BG said today in
its annual report.  BG shares are about 15 percent lower since the end of
October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
