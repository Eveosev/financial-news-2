Sampo Oyj (SAMAS) , the owner of the Nordic
region’s largest property and casualty insurer, fell the most in
a year in Helsinki trading after Bank of America Merrill Lynch
downgraded its recommendation on the stock.  Sampo shares  fell as much as 4.1 percent, the most since
April 13, 2012, and slid 3.6 percent to 30.01 euros at 4:35 p.m.
local time. Trading exceeded the average daily volume during the
past three months.  BofAML analysts including Blair Stewart cut their
 recommendation  on Sampo to neutral from buy, citing “a very
strong share price performance” this year. The insurer’s stock
will rise to 31.60 euros in 12 months, the analysts estimate.
Sampo has added 23 percent so far this year, giving the company
a value of 16.8 billion euros ($21.5 billion).  “We have long viewed the company as high quality both from
an operational and management perspective. We continue to
believe this is the case,” the analysts said. Even so, “the
share price now more adequately reflects these characteristics.
We no longer see sufficient total return potential to advocate a
buy stance on the shares.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
