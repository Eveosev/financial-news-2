Confidence among U.S. consumers
stabilized last week, stemming a pullback in sentiment that had
threatened to check recent gains in spending.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index increased to minus
34.1 in the week ended March 31 from a six-week low of minus
34.4 in the prior period. The gain was within the margin of
error of 3 percentage points. Measures of the state of the
economy and buying climate improved.  The comfort readings from January through March were the
strongest on average of any first quarter since 2008 as a pickup
in hiring and record stock prices helped consumers overcome an
increase in the  payroll tax . The Labor Department’s employment
report tomorrow will probably set the near-term tone for
household spending as Americans wait to see if  federal budget 
cuts are damaging the economy.  “Consumer sentiment is likely to experience a period of
moderate retrenchment because of more pronounced job losses due
to sequestration and the lagged impact of tax hikes,” said
 Joseph Brusuelas , a senior economist at Bloomberg LP in New
York.  More Americans than projected filed applications for
 unemployment benefits  last week, reflecting the difficulty the
government has adjusting the figures around the Easter holiday
and spring break at schools, another report showed today.  Jobless  claims  rose by 28,000 to 385,000 in the week ended
March 30, the highest since Nov. 24, according to Labor
Department figures. The median forecast of 47 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for a drop to 353,000.  Stock Prices  Stocks were little changed, with the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index increasing 0.1 percent to 1,555.63 at 9:39 a.m. in New
York. Treasuries rose, with 10-year note yields briefly touching
a three-month low of 1.76 percent.  The comfort index’s measure assessing Americans’ views on
the current  state of the economy  climbed to minus 60.6 from
minus 61.1 following four straight declines.  The  buying-climate  index improved to minus 40.7 from minus
41.7 the prior week. Thirty percent said it was a good time to
buy things that they want or need, up from 29 percent last week.  By contrast, the gauge of  personal finances  fell to minus
0.9 last week, its lowest level since early February, from minus
0.5 the prior period.  An unexpected rebound at the end of March put the
Thomson/Reuters University of  Michigan ’s  consumer sentiment 
index more in line with the Bloomberg comfort gauge. Michigan’s
measure jumped to 78.6 last month from a preliminary reading of
71.8, the group reported last week. It was now little changed
from February’s 77.6, erasing the previously reported decline.  Cross Currents  Confidence is making little headway as it’s buffeted by
cross currents. Gains in hiring,  rising stocks  and an improving
housing market are undergirding attitudes just as the levy that
funds  Social Security  reverted at the start of the year to its
2010 level of 6.2 percent from 4.2 percent. Workers earning
$50,000 take home about $83 less a month.  Unemployment fell to 7.7 percent in February, the lowest in
four years, from 7.9 percent in January, and the economy added
236,000 jobs, Labor Department reported last month. March
numbers are due tomorrow, and economists surveyed by Bloomberg
estimate the jobless rate held at 7.7 percent and payrolls
climbed by 190,000.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has  gained  8.9 percent this
year through yesterday, and closed at a record high of 1,570.25
on April 2.  A  housing recovery  is also helping restore household net
worth.  Home prices  rose 10.2 percent in the 12 months through
February, the biggest increase in seven years, according to data
from  Irvine , California-based CoreLogic Inc.  Auto Sales  Strengthening  consumer confidence  would signal spending on
autos and other big-ticket items will continue to improve,
making companies including  Ford Motor Co. (F)  more optimistic.  “The outlook has improved in terms of the employment
growth and income gains,” Jenny Lin, Ford’s senior economist
for the Americas, said on an April 2 sales and revenue call.
“The buying appetite for houses and consumer durables remain
actually very favorable.”  Among households earning $50,000 to $75,000 a year, comfort
rose to minus 10.6, its highest level since December 2007, from
minus 23.2, according to today’s report.  Conversely, sentiment among those earning less than $15,000
dropped 7.8 points to its lowest level in almost two months.
Confidence for this group had climbed 35 points from January
through mid March.  Confidence improved in three of four regions of the country
last week, falling only in the West.  Men, Women  Men were at their most optimistic in almost a year, and
women were at their most pessimistic since mid-January.
Confidence among adults between 55 and 64 years old retreated to
its lowest since early October.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index, compiled by Langer
Research Associates in  New York , conducts telephone surveys with
a random sample of 1,000 consumers 18 and older. Each week, 250
respondents are asked for their views on the economy, personal
finances and buying climate. The percentage of negative
responses is subtracted from the share of positive views and
divided by three. The most recent reading is based on the
average of responses over the previous four weeks.  The comfort index can range from 100, indicating every
participant in the survey had a positive response to all three
components, to minus 100, signaling all views were negative.  If you’d like to receive a copy of the comfort results on a
