Egypt’s navy seized a Togolese-
flagged ship carrying heavy weapons late yesterday and was
questioning crew members at the port of Safaga, Reuters
 reported .  The ship, seized as it entered Egyptian territorial waters
in the  Red Sea , contained weapons and ammunition, Reuters
reported, citing Ahmed Mohamed Ali, an Egyptian military
spokesman.  The vessel belongs to a private company that provides
security to ships passing through dangerous areas and the
weapons discovered “are linked to the nature of their work and
the tasks assigned to them to secure commercial vessels,” Ali
said, according to the report.  The ship was found north of Ras Muhammad in the  Sinai
Peninsula , Reuters cited Ali as saying. It was en route to Togo
from the Israeli port of Eilat,  Agence France-Presse  reported,
citing unidentified security officials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
