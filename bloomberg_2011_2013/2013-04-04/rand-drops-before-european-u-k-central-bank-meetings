The rand declined against the dollar
before interest rate-setting decisions by the Bank of England
and the European Central Bank.  The South African currency traded 0.5 percent lower at
9.2734 a dollar by 10:36 a.m. in Johannesburg and was little
changed at 11.8536 a euro. Yields on the benchmark 10.5 percent
government debt due December 2026 fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 7.34 percent.  The Bank of England will probably keep the U.K.’s main
interest rate at a record-low 0.5 percent, according to all 50
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The European Central Bank
will leave its benchmark interest rate at a record-low 0.75
percent today, according to 54 of 56 economists in another
Bloomberg survey. The  Bank of Japan (8301)  said it will boost monthly
bond purchases to 7 trillion yen ($73.4 billion).  “Event risk comes from today’s BoJ, BoE and ECB meetings
as well as tomorrow’s U.S. payroll figures,” John Cairns, a
currency strategist at Johannesburg-based Rand Merchant Bank
wrote in an e-mailed note to clients.  The rand has lost 8.6 percent since the start of the year,
making it the worst performer among 25 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
