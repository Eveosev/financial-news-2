Arizona  Cardinals linebacker Daryl Washington, who led the team with 134 tackles last year, will
miss the first four games of the 2013 season without pay for
violating the National Football League’s substance-abuse policy.  Washington, 26, whose suspension was announced yesterday,
will be allowed to return to the Cardinals’ active roster on the
day after the team’s fourth regular-season game, the league said.  “I was always taught that when you make a mistake, you
admit it, learn from it and face whatever consequences there
are,” Washington said in a statement on the team’s website. “I
take full responsibility and I understand that I let down my
teammates, the organization and fans.”  Washington, a 2010 second-round pick in the  NFL draft  out
of  Texas Christian University , signed a six-year contract in
September.  “Adversity and dealing with it is part of the business,
but when it’s avoidable like this was, it’s particularly
tough,” Cardinals coach Bruce Arians said in a statement. “One
of the biggest things we preach is accountability.”  Washington, a  Pro Bowl  alternate who led all NFL inside
linebackers with nine sacks last season, is eligible to
participate in offseason and preseason practices and games for
the Cardinals, who went 5-11 in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
