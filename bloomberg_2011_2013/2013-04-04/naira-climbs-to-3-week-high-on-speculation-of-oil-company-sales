The Nigerian currency rose for a
third day to the highest in three weeks as  oil companies  in
 Africa ’s biggest producer were said to sell dollars to meet
local expenses.  The naira climbed 0.1 percent to 157.87 per dollar by 11:38
a.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital, the highest on an
intraday basis since March 14, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency’s declined 1.1 percent this year.  “Some companies sold some undisclosed amount of dollars,”
Sewa Wusa, head of research at Sterling Capital Ltd., said by
phone from Lagos. If sales continue “we’ll definitely see some
more strength,” he said.  Oil companies are the second-biggest source of the currency
after the  Central Bank of Nigeria , which offers foreign currency
at auctions on Mondays and Wednesdays to maintain exchange-rate
stability.  The central bank  sold $237 million  at an auction yesterday,
compared with $300 million at the previous sale on March 27. It
didn’t hold an offer on April 1 because of a public holiday.  Nigeria ’s  foreign-currency reserves  have risen 10 percent
this year to $48.7 billion to April 2, according to data
compiled by the central bank.  Bonny Light crude , the nation’s
main export grade, is priced above this year’s $79 budgeted
benchmark set by the government at $110.26 a barrel.  Bond Yields  “Provided that the oil price obliges, in our view the CBN
will be able to hold the line on the naira exchange rate this
year,” Gregory Kronsten and Olubunmi Asaolu, strategists at FBN
Capital Ltd. in  London , wrote in an e-mailed note today.
“Reserves at end-March provided cover for more than nine
months’ imports of goods, and close to seven months when we
include services.”  Yields on the government’s local-currency bonds due June
2019 rose eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 10.73
percent, according to yesterday’s prices compiled on the
 Financial Markets Dealers Association  website.  Borrowing costs on Nigeria’s $500 million of Eurobonds due
January 2021 declined six basis points to 4.31 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi rose less than 0.1 percent to 1.942 per dollar
in Accra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
