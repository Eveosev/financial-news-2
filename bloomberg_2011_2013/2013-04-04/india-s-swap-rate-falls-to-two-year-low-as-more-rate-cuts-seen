India’s one-year  interest-rate swaps 
fell to a two-year low on speculation slowing economic growth
will spur the central bank to lower borrowing costs.  The contracts fell for a seventh day after a report
released April 1 showed manufacturing growth slowed to a 16-
month low in March. Asia’s third-largest economy probably
expanded 5 percent in the year ended March 31, which would be
the least since 2003, the  Central Statistical Office  predicted
in February. The  Reserve Bank  of India has cut the repurchase
 rate  by 50 basis points to 7.5 percent in 2013.  “More rate cuts are expected this year as growth continues
to be a concern,” said R.S. Chauhan, chief dealer of fixed-
income and currencies at  State Bank  of Bikaner & Jaipur in
Mumbai. “Swaps are signaling this expectation.”  The one-year swap, a derivative contract used to guard
against fluctuations in funding costs, fell two basis points to
7.41 percent as of 10:12 a.m. in Mumbai, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That’s the lowest level since April 4, 2011.  The Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to 52 from 54.2 in
February, according to a report published by HSBC Holdings Plc
and Markit Economics on April 1. Fifty is the dividing line
between expansion and contraction.  The yield on the 8.15 percent government bonds due June
2022 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.94
percent, according to the central bank’s trading system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
