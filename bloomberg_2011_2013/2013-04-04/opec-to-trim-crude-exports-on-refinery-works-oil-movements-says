The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will cut crude shipments next month as
global refinery maintenance peaks, according to tanker tracker
Oil Movements.  The group that supplies about 40 percent of the world’s oil
will reduce crude exports by about 120,000 barrels a day, or 0.5
percent, to 23.7 million a day in the four weeks to April 20,
the researcher said today in an e-mailed report. The figures
exclude  Angola  and  Ecuador .  “Refiner crude demand is lower right now,”  Roy Mason , the
company’s founder, said by phone from Halifax, England. “It
reaches a seasonal low in April.”  Middle East shipments will decrease by 0.5 percent to 17.38
million barrels a day in the period, compared with 17.46 in the
four weeks to March 23, according to Oil Movements. That figure
includes non-OPEC members Oman and Yemen.  OPEC’s collective production target of 30 million barrels a
day is “working beautifully,” and there is no need to
publicize individual national limits at its next meeting on May
31, Abdalla El-Badri, the group’s secretary general, said today
in Paris.  Crude on board tankers will average 468.87 million barrels,
down 1.9 percent on the previous period, the data show. Oil
Movements calculates the volumes by tallying tanker bookings.
Its figures exclude crude held on vessels for storage.  OPEC comprises  Algeria , Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
