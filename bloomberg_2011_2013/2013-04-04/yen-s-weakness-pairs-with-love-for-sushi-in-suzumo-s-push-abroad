Sushi’s global popularity coupled
with the yen’s 18 percent decline in the past six months is
proving to be a sweet spot for  Suzumo Machinery Co. (6405) ,  Japan ’s
biggest maker of automatic sushi chefs.  The company plans to triple overseas sales of the machines
to as many as 3,000 units from last fiscal year and is adding
production capacity to meet demand, President Ikuya Oneda, 69,
said yesterday. Suzumo may start taking payments in dollars, if
customers request, as the yen weakens, he said. “A weaker yen
will make it easier for us to do business,” Oneda said.  The company’s new line to make the automatic chefs, which
shape rice into blocks to serve with fish or other ingredients,
will open by about November at its plant in Saitama, north of
 Tokyo , Oneda said. Orders for the machines are coming from  South
America ,  Europe  and  Asia  as global consumption of seafood is
expected to increase by as much as 17 percent per person during
the next two decades.  “Sushi is becoming popular, not just because of being a
healthy choice but also being inexpensive,” Oneda said in an
interview at the company’s headquarters in Tokyo. “Our machines
are helping reduce labor costs” for clients, he said.  Suzumo, whose clients include the U.K.’s Yo! Sushi chain,
targets to raise sales to 10 billion yen ($104 million) in the
“mid-term,” Oneda said, without elaboration. Revenue is
 forecast  at 6.85 billion yen for the 12 months ended March.  Shares of Suzumo rose 4.7 percent, the biggest gain since
March 28, to 1,138 yen at close on the Jasdaq market. The stock
has climbed 79 percent this year, compared with a 23 percent
gain in the Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  ‘Sushi Boom’  Suzumo, which has more than 60 percent of the sushi machine
market in Japan, plans to double its sales staff for overseas
markets to about 16 this fiscal year, Oneda said. The company
plans to export its equipment to 100 countries in the 12-month
period, up from 64, he said.  The world’s fish consumption may rise to 20 kilograms (44
pounds) per person by 2030 from 17.1 kilograms in 2008,
according to the  United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization .  “There seems to be a sushi boom everywhere in the globe,”
said  Makoto Sengoku , a market analyst at Tokai Tokyo Securities
Co. in Tokyo. “Suzumo is benefiting from it, as long as the
boom continues.”  London Restaurants  In the U.K., there are about 500 Japanese restaurants, up
from about 450 in 2011, according to an estimate from Yukiko
Takahashi, the general manager of  Eat-Japan , a London-based
promoter of Japanese food.  “Big sushi take-away chains are doing really well in the
U.K.,” said Takahashi. “Every side street has a sushi
restaurant in  London .”  Lots of sushi take-away restaurants use the rice-making
machines produced by Suzumo and others, according to Takahashi.  The company’s  machine  can produce 3,600 blocks of rice per
hour, according to its website. Another type of a machine by the
manufacturer can make as many as 400 sushi rolls per hour.  Suzumo developed its first sushi-making equipment in 1981,
according to its website. The company, which employs about 260
people, opened an office in Torrance,  California , where  Toyota
Motor Corp. (7203) ’s U.S. sales unit is also based, in 2006.  The number of Japanese restaurants in the U.S. surged more
than 50 percent to  14,129  including 3,963 in California in the
five years through 2010, according to the Tokyo-based Japan
External Trade Organization.  The company  forecast  net income of 510 million yen for the
12 months ended March 31, up 41 percent from 361 million yen a
year earlier, Suzumo said Feb. 6.  To contact the reporters on this story:
