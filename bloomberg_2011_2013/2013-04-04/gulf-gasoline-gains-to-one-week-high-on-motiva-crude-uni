Gulf Coast gasoline strengthened the
most in a week against futures after Motiva Enterprises LLC was
said to be keeping a crude unit shut for another week at its
Port Arthur,  Texas , refinery.  The 600,000-barrel-a-day refinery, the largest in the U.S.,
will also keep a delayed coker idled until the end of this
weekend, two people familiar with operations said yesterday. The
units have been down since mid-February for what was originally
expected to be 38 days of repairs, said the people, who asked
not to be identified because the information isn’t public.  Citgo Petroleum Corp.’s Corpus Christi plant and  Phillips
66 (PSX) ’s Borger site, both in Texas, are also carrying out
maintenance. That may erode the region’s motor fuel supplies of
 74.2 million  barrels in the week ended March 29, according to
Energy Information Administration data.  The discount for  conventional , 87-octane gasoline on the
Gulf narrowed 1.75 cents to 22.75 cents a gallon below futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 4:10 p.m., the
smallest differential since March 28, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Reformulated gasoline , or RBOB, in the region increased
1.37 cents to a discount of 6.38 cents a gallon. Ultra-low-
sulfur diesel fell  0.5 cent  to a premium of 0.75 cent a gallon
over Nymex futures.  The 3-2-1 crack spread on the Gulf, a rough measure of
 refining  margins for gasoline and diesel based on West Texas
Intermediate in Cushing,  Oklahoma , advanced 64 cents to $23.13 a
barrel, the first increase in six days. The same spread based on
Light Louisiana Sweet oil rose $1.39 to $7.13 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
