President Dennis Lockhart said he isn’t convinced the U.S.
economy this year will significantly outperform the modest
growth of recent years.  “I have not seen enough evidence yet to convince me that
2013 is going to break out of that pattern that we’ve seen,
really over the last four years,” Lockhart said in a panel
discussion at the University of Dayton in  Ohio  with Chicago Fed
President Charles Evans.  The economy will see “a continuation of the story that
we’ve been living,” Lockhart said. “A modest pace of growth,
inflation that is pretty well contained and a very gradual
reduction in unemployment.”  Evans this year holds a vote on the policy-setting Federal
Open Market Committee while Lockhart does not.  To contact the reporters on this story:
