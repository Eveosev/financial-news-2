Gold will rise toward $1,850 an
ounce by the end of this year as U.S. stimulus and debt concerns
spur demand for a protection of wealth, before prices begin to
drop as economic growth improves,  Thomson Reuters  GFMS said.  World investment fell about 1.8 percent to a four-year low
in 2012 as bar and coin purchases slowed, GFMS, a unit of
Thomson Reuters Corp., said in a report today. Central-bank
buying at a 48-year high provided a “firm floor” for prices
last year and will probably remain at a similar pace this year,
it said. Global jewelry demand may weaken this year as recycling
increases amid higher prices, the researcher said.  Bullion rallied the past 12 years and as much as doubled
since 2008 after central banks increased stimulus to bolster
economic growth. Prices slid this year on confidence that a
recovery is strengthening and as some Federal Reserve policy
makers debated the pace of debt buying. The International
Monetary Fund predicts global expansion will climb to 4.1
percent in 2014, from 3.5 percent this year.  “Even though we’ve had some hawkish noise from some within
the Fed, it’s difficult to see a material unwinding of the
quantitative easing program until well into 2014,” Neil Meader,
head of precious metals research at GFMS, said in a separate
statement. “We can perceive a return to something more like
normality for the macro-economic backdrop, and that could easily
entail the start of a secular bear market, perhaps in late 2013
or more probably in 2014.”  Gold Price  Bullion for immediate delivery fell 7.3 percent to
$1,552.78 in London this year. It averaged a record $1,669 last
year and set an all-time high of $1,921.15 in September 2011. A
close at $1,520.18 would be a 20 percent drop from Sept. 5,
2011, and the common definition of a bear market.  Prices slid 4 percent since March 21, when they reached a
three-week high as delays to Cyprus’s bailout added to concern
that  Europe ’s debt crisis may worsen. The Fed is purchasing $85
billion of Treasury and mortgage debt a month. Automatic federal
government spending cuts, or sequestration, took effect at the
start of last month and will trim $85 billion through September
across federal agencies.  World gold investment slipped to 1,605 metric tons last
year, the researcher said. The value still rose for a fifth
straight year to a record of about $86 billion. Bar demand
dropped 17 percent to 998 tons and official coin sales declined
18 percent to a four-year low of 200 tons in 2012, GFMS said.  Investors sold about 195.1 tons from exchange-traded
products since holdings reached a record in December, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. They now own 2,437.4 tons, equal to
more than 10 months of mine production.  Gold Fabrication  Total fabrication usage slipped for a second year in 2012,
falling 5.3 percent to 2,613 tons, GFMS said. Jewelry demand
decreased 4.2 percent to a three-year low of 1,893 tons last
year as buying slowed in Europe and fell to a three-year low in
India.  China ’s jewelry fabrication increased for a 10th straight
year, rising 0.6 percent to a record 498 tons, the researcher
said.  Central-bank purchases increased 16 percent to a 48-year
high of 532 tons last year, GFMS estimates. It said the gross
figure doesn’t include the increase in reserves reported by
 Turkey , which has been accepting gold in its reserve
requirements from commercial banks. Buying may total as much as
150 tons each quarter this year, it said.  “Central banks in the developing world are expected to
continue their moves into gold,” GFMS wrote in the report. Gold
will “remain a useful means of reserve diversification and a
hedge against currency debasement.”  Scrap Supply  Scrap sales dropped about 3.1 percent last year to a four-
year low of 1,616 tons, even as recycling in  India ’s sub-
continent region climbed to near a record, GFMS estimates.
Above-ground global stockpiles, or the amount ever mined,
reached about 174,100 tons by the end of last year, it said.  Mine output increased 0.8 percent to a record 2,861 tons in
2012, and will probably grow this year due to new mines and
operation restarts, the researcher said. Peru overtook South
Africa as the fifth-biggest miner last year, with China,
 Australia , the U.S. and Russia the top four producers. Gold
producers’ all-in costs rose 12 percent to $1,211 an ounce, it
said.  Bloomberg competes with Thomson Reuters in selling
