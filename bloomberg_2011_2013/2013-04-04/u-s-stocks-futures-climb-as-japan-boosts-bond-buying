U.S.  stocks  rose, rebounding from the biggest selloff in more than a month for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, as central banks’ pledges on stimulus efforts overshadowed a rise in American jobless claims.  McDonald’s Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. added more than 1.4 percent to pace advances in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average . Best Buy Co. rose 16 percent, the most in the  S&P 500 , after Samsung Electronics Co. said it would staff mini-stores at the retailer’s U.S. locations. Facebook Inc. climbed 3.1 percent as it announced smartphone software with a modified version of Google Inc.’s operating system.  The S&P 500 rose 0.4 percent to 1,559.98 at 4 p.m. in New York.

ECB officials meeting in  Frankfurt  left  interest rates  on hold.  Fed Stimulus  The  bull market  in equities entered its fifth year last month, with the  S&P 500 (SPX)  more than doubling from its bottom in 2009, as corporate earnings topped estimates and the  Federal Reserve  carried out an unprecedented three rounds of bond purchases to spur the economy. The S&P 500 and Dow closed at all-time highs on April 2.  Jobless claims rose by 28,000 to 385,000 in the week ended March 30, the highest since Nov. 24, Labor Department figures showed today in  Washington . The median forecast of 47 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a drop to 353,000. The results reflected the difficulty the government has adjusting the figures around the Easter holiday and spring break at schools.  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  slid 1.1 percent yesterday, the most in more than a month, as a report from ADP Research Institute showed companies boosted employment by 158,000 workers in March, below economists’ forecasts calling for a 200,000 gain.  Jobs Data  The jobs data come before tomorrow’s non-farm payrolls report from the Labor Department, which may show employers hired a net 190,000 workers for the month, according to the median forecast of 87 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Investors will begin to focus on first-quarter earnings reports beginning next week, with Alcoa Inc. scheduled on April 8 to be the first company in the Dow to report results.

The companies plan to add smaller Samsung spaces by June at about 1,000 other Best Buy and Best Buy Mobile locations, Samsung said.  Facebook Software  Facebook rose 3.1 percent to $27.07. The company unveiled smartphone software that puts social-networking features front and center on a handset, stepping up efforts to boost sales of advertising on small screens.
