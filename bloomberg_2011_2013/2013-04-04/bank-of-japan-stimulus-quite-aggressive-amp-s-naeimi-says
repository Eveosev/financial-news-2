(Corrects currency conversion in the fifth paragraph.)  Nader Naeimi, the Sydney-based head
of dynamic asset allocation at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which
manages $126 billion, comments in a telephone interview today
after the  Bank of Japan (8301)  announcement.  Bank of  Japan  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda began his campaign
to end 15 years of deflation with a strengthened stimulus
program that will see the central bank buy 7 trillion yen ($73
billion) of bonds a month:  “It’s quite an aggressive move and it shows the Bank of
Japan is more serious than they’ve ever been. They are already
quite close to doing open-ended quantitative easing, anyway, and
they are likely to announce that later in the month.  ‘‘They have announced a lot more than I thought they would.
There’s more to come. They’ve announced a whole bunch of
positive moves.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
