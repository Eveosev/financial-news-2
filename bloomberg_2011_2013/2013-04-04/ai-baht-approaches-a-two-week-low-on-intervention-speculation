Thailand ’s baht traded within 0.4
percent of a two-week low amid concern the central bank will
seek to curb appreciation that threatens exports. Bonds gained.  The baht, Asia’s best-performing currency this year, rose
4.1 percent since Dec. 31 and touched a 16-year high last month.
February’s 5.8 percent decline in exports was partly caused by
 exchange-rate  strength, Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong
said yesterday in Brunei. The  International Monetary Fund  will
contribute about 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) as part of a
financial rescue program for Cyprus, IMF Managing Director
 Christine Lagarde  said yesterday.  “Concern about intervention seems to be growing as the
baht has come quite far while export is an important part of the
Thai economy,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a researcher at the Japan
Center for Economic Research in Tokyo. “Europe’s debt concern
is not completely wiped out, and that’s providing some excuse
for a correction in the baht.”  The baht was little changed at 29.38 per dollar as of 3:10
p.m. in Bangkok from 29.37 yesterday, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The currency reached 29.48 yesterday, the weakest
level since March 19. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
dropped seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 5.15
percent.  Kittiratt and the Bank of Thailand said yesterday policy
makers are monitoring capital flows and the exchange rate.  Government bonds  rose as official data showed global funds
 purchased  $175 million more local sovereign debt than they sold
in the first three days of this week, adding to net purchases of
$9.6 billion in the first quarter.  The yield on Thailand’s 3.625 percent notes due June 2023
fell two basis points to 3.52 percent, the lowest level since
March 28, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It has
averaged 3.63 percent this year.  “Inflows into the  bond market  are quite large and provide
support for the baht,” Hayashi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
