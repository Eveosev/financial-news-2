Airbus SAS is closing in on its 2013
order target four months into the year after already winning
more than 600 orders from airlines snapping up the fuel-
efficient A320 single-aisle bestseller.  The planemaker has targeted 700 gross orders for the year,
a goal that’s come within reach after the company listed 431
gross contracts through March. Combined with commitments for 102
planes from  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  and 82 from  Turkish Airlines (THYAO) ,
new business won so far this year comes to 615 units.  After opening 2013 with a prediction for as many as 650
orders, Airbus Chief Operating Officer  John Leahy  has raised the
goal by a further 50 planes. The planemaker is most likely to
exceed even that target, given the  Paris Air show , a one-week
event in June that typically coincides with large-scale orders.  “The figures show just how solid the cycle for new
aircraft demand is,” said  Yan Derocles , an analyst at Oddo
Securities in Paris. “Even if some airlines are having
difficulties, it’s clear that Airbus will easily manage to find
buyers for planes.”  Among customers Airbus is pursuing is EasyJet Plc, which is
negotiating to add single-aisle planes for fleet expansion plans
beyond 2017. EasyJet’s last major purchase was a decade ago, for
120 Airbus single-aisle planes valued at $6 billion.  In the first three months, the planemaker, a unit of
Toulouse, France-based European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co.,
delivered 144 planes, including 114 single-aisle aircraft, 26
A330 wide-bodies, and four A380 superjumbos, it said today.  Airbus’s order backlog is at record 4,948 airliners, or
more than seven years of production, as the aircraft maker has
pushed output to new levels with the build rate for A330
widebodies now at an all-time high of 10 a month.  Boeing Co. (BA) , its sole rival in the global market for large
commercial airliners, won 191 net orders through March 26 after
two cancellations. It delivered 82 planes through February.  To contact the reporters on this story:
