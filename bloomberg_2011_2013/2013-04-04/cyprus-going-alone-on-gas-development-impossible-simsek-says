Any effort by Cyprus to extract and
sell gas while disregarding claims of  Turkey  and the island’s
Turkish community is “not only unfair but also impossible,”
Turkey’s finance minister said.  “These natural resources should be used for the benefit of
both communities,” Finance Minister  Mehmet Simsek  said in
response to questions at a conference in Istanbul today. The
easiest route for Cyprus to bring natural resources to
international markets would be through Turkey, he said.  Cyprus has been divided since 1974, when Turkey invaded
after a coup by supporters of union with Greece. Turkey is the
only country that recognizes a Turkish Cypriot state in the
north and has objected to Cyprus’s search for gas around the
island on the grounds that Turkish Cypriots should share in any
benefits.  Greek Cypriots in 2004 rejected a plan backed by  Kofi Annan , then Secretary-General of the  United Nations , to unite
the island. The Turks voted in favor. The plan should be put
back on the table as Cyprus restructures its economy in exchange
for a 10 billion-euro rescue program, Simsek said.  “We’d like our neighbors to be stable, strong and
prosperous,” he said. “The best help we can give to South
Cyprus would be a solution to the Cyprus problem in line with
the U.N. solution in 2004.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
