INA Industrija Nafte d.d. , the
Croatian subsidiary of  Hungary ’s largest refiner  Mol Nyrt. (MOL) ,
raised a $400 million revolving credit facility, a week after
its parent obtained a similar deal.  The three-year multicurrency loan, which can be extended by
as much as two years, was coordinated by Erste Group Bank AG and
ING Groep NV, according to a statement from the Zagreb, Croatia-
based company. Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. is facility
agent.  Budapest-based Mol signed a $480 million three-year credit
line with the same extension options on March 27, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Citigroup Inc., Erste Group Bank and
KBC Bank NV arranged the deal, the data show. Both companies
asked banks to propose terms for loans of as much as 400 million
euros in January, people with knowledge of the matter said at
the time.  INA also increased an intragroup loan agreement with Mol to
$300 million from $200 million, it said in the statement. Mol
owns a controlling 49.1 percent stake in  Croatia ’s largest
refiner, with the country’s government the second-largest
shareholder, according to the company’s first-half  report .  To contact the reporter on this story:
