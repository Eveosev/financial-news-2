The market for corporate borrowing
through  short-term IOUs  contracted to the least since November
led by a decline in nonfinancial issuance.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper
fell $19.5 billion to $1.002 trillion outstanding in the week
ended yesterday, the  Federal Reserve  said today on its website.
That’s the lowest level since the market touched $997.9 billion
in the period ended Nov. 21.  Companies are issuing more corporate bonds to lock in
longer-term, stable funding with  yields  at almost record lows,
in preference to shorter-term financing via commercial paper,
which has to be rolled over more often.  “Non-financial names have found alternative funding
avenues,”  Sean Simko , a money manager at SEI Investments Co. in
Oaks, Pennsylvania, whose team manages about $3 billion of
commercial paper, wrote in an e-mail. “They have taken
advantage of longer term funding.”  IOUs issued by  non-financial companies  declined for a sixth
week, dropping $14.8 billion to $184.5 billion, the lowest level
since $184.2 billion for the period ended Oct. 31.  Corporations sell commercial paper, typically maturing in
270 days or less, to fund everyday activities such as rent and
salaries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
