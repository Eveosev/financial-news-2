Fairway Group Holdings Corp. (FWM) , the
supermarket chain focused on greater  New York , is seeking as
much as $163.8 million in its U.S. initial public offering.  The company is offering 13.7 million shares for $10 to $12
each, according to a regulatory filing today. The sale is
scheduled to price on April 16, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The amount is equivalent to a 33 percent stake in the
New York-based grocery retailer.  At the midpoint of the  price range , the company would have
a market value of about $453.6 million. Fairway, which started
as a small neighborhood market in the 1930s, is moving ahead
with the IPO after expansion in suburban New York,  New Jersey 
and Connecticut helped boost sales for at least three years in a
row.  Fairway joins others in industries from technology to
energy that are taking advantage of greater investor appetite
for new equities as U.S. stocks have surged to record highs this
year. U.S. IPOs raised 36 percent more last quarter than they
did in the year-earlier period, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Credit Suisse Group AG and Bank of America Corp. are
leading the IPO. The shares will list on the Nasdaq Stock Market
under the symbol FWM.  To contact the reporter on this story:
