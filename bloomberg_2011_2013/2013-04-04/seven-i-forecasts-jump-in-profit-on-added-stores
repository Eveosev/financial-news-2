Seven & I Holdings Co. (3382) , owner of the
7-Eleven convenience-store brand, forecast a 23 percent increase
in profit this fiscal year after the addition of new stores.  Net income may rise to 170 billion yen ($1.8 billion) for
the year ending February 2014, the Tokyo-based retailer said in
a statement today. The forecast was higher than the 168 billion
yen average of 15 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The company plans to open a record 1,500 new  convenience
stores  domestically this fiscal year, tapping demand as
consumers increasingly rely on the shops for meals formerly
purchased at grocery stores or fast-food outlets. The operator
of Ito-Yokado supermarkets and 7-Eleven convenience stores,
 Japan â€™s biggest chain, said operating profit will probably rise
15 percent to 340 billion yen.  Net income rose 6.3 percent to 138 billion yen while sales
rose 4.3 percent to 5 trillion yen in the year ended February
2013, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
