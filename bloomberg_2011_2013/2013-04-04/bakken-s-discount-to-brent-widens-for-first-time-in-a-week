Bakken crude on the  spot market 
widened its discount to the European benchmark crude for the
first time in a week.  Bakken priced in Clearbrook,  Minnesota , widened its
 discount  to Dated Brent by $1.05 to $11.07 a barrel at 12:52
p.m.  New York  time, according to data collected by Bloomberg.
The discount has narrowed since reaching a 2012-record level of
$34.77 on Oct. 30.  Bakken competes with foreign oils priced off Brent for
space in U.S. East Coast refineries, where companies such as  PBF
Energy Inc. (PBF)  and Philadelphia Energy Solutions have increased
rail-unloading capacity to take the crude.  Bakken at Clearbrook narrowed its  premium  to U.S. benchmark
West Texas Intermediate in Cushing, Oklahoma, by 50 cents for
the second straight day to $1.50 a barrel. The price in
Clearbrook is higher than at wells in  North Dakota  and  Montana 
because of gathering and transportation costs.  Continental Resources Inc.,  Whiting Petroleum Corp. (WLL)  and
others have used techniques like horizontal drilling and
hydraulic fracturing to boost production in North Dakota to a
peak of 770,000 barrels a day in December from less than 100,000
in July 2005.  The boom has helped the U.S. reverse a decades-long decline
in oil production. The country  produced  7.08 million barrels of
oil a day in the first 13 weeks of the year, the most since
1992, EIA data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
