The Philippine peso fell the most in
a week on speculation the central bank will take more steps to
curb inflows.  Government bonds  were little changed.  The currency dropped for a fourth day after Governor  Amando
Tetangco  reiterated yesterday the monetary authority could
introduce more measures aimed at slowing the peso’s 4.3 percent
advance against the dollar in the past year, the second-best
performance in Asia after Thailand’s baht. The Philippines won
its first investment-grade rating from  Fitch Ratings  on March 27.  “The peso is fundamentally sound and supported by the
latest rating upgrade,” said Reuben Mark Angeles, head of
research at First Metro Securities Brokerage Corp. in  Manila .
“They don’t want it to be too strong relative to other regional
currencies.”  The peso weakened 0.3 percent to 41.045 per dollar as of
10:43 a.m. Manila, according to data from Tullett Prebon Plc.
The currency may trade between 40.80 and 41 through the end of
June, Angeles said. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected exchange-rate moves used to price options, fell three
basis points or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.81 percent, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Overseas investors bought $1 billion more local stocks than
they sold this year, compared with $430 million in the same
period in 2012, exchange data show. The benchmark share index
has rallied every month since August and reached an all-time
high on April 1.  The yield on the 6.125 percent bonds due October 2037 was
steady at 3.79 percent, according to Tradition Financial
Services. It reached 3.71 percent on April 2, the lowest level
since it was sold in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
