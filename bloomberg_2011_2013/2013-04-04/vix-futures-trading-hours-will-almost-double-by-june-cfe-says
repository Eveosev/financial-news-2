The CBOE Futures Exchange LLC will
almost double trading hours for  futures  linked to the benchmark
gauge for U.S. options prices as part of a move toward around-
the-clock market access.  Futures on the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index, or VIX, will trade in a new 45-minute period that begins
at 4:30 p.m. in  New York , starting May 30, based on an e-mailed
statement from the exchange. CFE will add five hours before the
current 8 a.m. start in a second phase beginning June 17.  “The first phase of expanded trading hours is designed to
meet demand from U.S. customers for a post-settlement trading
period,” said the Chicago-based exchange, which is owned by the
biggest U.S. options market. “The second phase will allow
European-based customers to trade VIX futures during their local
trading hours.”  The extensions mean the VIX contracts will trade from 3
a.m. to 4:15 p.m. five days a week. The evening session from
4:30 p.m. to 5:15 p.m. will mark the start of a new trading day
and be available Monday through Thursday, CFE said.  CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE) , which owns CFE, said in September that
it intends to expand trading for VIX futures to 24 hours, five
days a week starting this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
