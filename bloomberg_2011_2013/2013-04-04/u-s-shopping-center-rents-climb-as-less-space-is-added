U.S. shopping-center occupancies
rose to a three-year high in the first quarter, enabling
landlords to raise rents as less space was added to the market,
 Reis Inc. (REIS)  said.  Vacancies at neighborhood and community shopping  centers 
fell to 10.6 percent from 10.9 percent, and effective rents, or
what’s paid after any landlord discounts, rose to $16.63 a
square foot from $16.51 a year earlier, the property-research
firm said in a report today. Rents and occupancies were last
higher in 2009, according to New York-based Reis.  “It’s a slow but consistent recovery,” Ryan Severino, a
Reis senior economist, said in a telephone interview. “There’s
nothing being built, so as long as there’s any semblance of
demand, it’s pushing vacancies down slightly and rents up
slightly.”  Retail landlords are benefiting from a slowly improving
labor market and little competition from new shopping centers.
The  jobless rate  dropped to 7.7 percent in February, the lowest
since December 2008, from 7.9 percent the previous month, the
Labor Department said. In the first quarter, 873,000 square feet
(81,000 square meters) of new shopping centers became available,
down 57 percent from a year earlier, according to Reis.  Occupied shopping-center space rose by a net 2.73 million
square feet in the third quarter, compared with 2.68 million
square feet in the previous three months and 3.51 million square
feet a year earlier, Reis said.  Until the U.S. employment recovery becomes more vigorous,
“retail sales will remain listless” and shopping-center
“vacancy compression will be slow and tedious,” Reis said in
the report.  At regional  malls , which typically include department
stores and are larger than neighborhood and community shopping
centers, vacancies fell to 8.3 percent in the first quarter from
9 percent a year earlier, and rents rose to $39.46 a square foot
from $39, Reis said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
