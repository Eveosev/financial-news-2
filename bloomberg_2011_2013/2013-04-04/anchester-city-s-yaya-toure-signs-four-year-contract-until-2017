Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure signed a new four-year contract until 2017, the Premier
League soccer champion said on its  website .  Toure, 29, joined City in 2010 from Barcelona and helped
the team win the F.A. Cup in his first season and the Premier
League title last year. City didn’t disclose terms of the deal,
although the Sun newspaper reported on its website it’s about  11
million pounds  ($17 million) per season.  “This is where I want to be,” Toure said. “I want to
continue winning titles and trophies and continue to make
history. I have enjoyed all of my time here and can’t wait for
the next chapter.”  Toure has scored 27 times in his three seasons at City,
including the goal in the 1-0 win over Stoke two years ago that
gave the Blues their first F.A. Cup since 1969.  The  Ivory Coast  international added nine goals last season
as City claimed its first league title in 44 years and has
scored eight times this campaign.  To contact the reporter on this story:
