North Korea ’s escalation of nuclear
threats against the U.S. present a “real concern,” U.K. Prime
Minister  David Cameron  said.  Speaking to defense-industry workers in Scotland today,
Cameron called on North Korea to abide by United Nations
Security Council resolutions and said threats from nations such
as North Korea emphasized the need for the U.K. to retain its
Trident nuclear deterrent.  “North Korea does now have missile technology that is able
to reach the whole of the U.S.,” Cameron said “If so they can
reach Europe and us too.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
