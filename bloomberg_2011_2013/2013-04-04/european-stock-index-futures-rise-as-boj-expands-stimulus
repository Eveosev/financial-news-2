European stocks  retreated, posting
the biggest two-day slump in more than four months, as European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said that the economic
recovery in the euro area remains subject to downside risks.  Banca Generali (BGN)  SpA lost 5.1 percent after Assicurazioni
Generali SpA sold part of its stake in the lender. European
Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. dropped 2.7 percent as an
investor offered to sell shares worth 384 million euros ($494
million) in the owner of Airbus SAS.  BTG Plc (BTG)  gained 1 percent
after increasing its sales forecast for 2013.  The benchmark  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  declined 1.1 percent
to 291.71 at the close in  London . The equity benchmark slid 0.9
percent yesterday and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index retreated
from a record high in  New York  as U.S. services and jobs data
missed forecasts.  “The outlook for growth in  Europe  isn’t great, meaning
earnings expectations for the second quarter are a little lower,
but that’s a known risk,” Carsten Hilck, who oversees about 5
billion euros at Union Investment Privatfonds GmbH in  Frankfurt ,
said in a phone interview. “There’s nothing new in what Draghi
is saying -- just more of the same. There are always risks to
economic forecasts. It’s a strange reaction in the market, I
expect it to recover and bounce back up after this.”  The companies listed on the Stoxx 600 will generate
earnings per share of 23.40 euros in 2013, according to analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. A year earlier, they predicted
EPS of 27.07 euros for this calendar year.  Economic Recovery  Draghi said that risks remain to the euro area’s economic
recovery in the second half of this year.  “Weak economic activity has extended into the early part
of the year and a gradual recovery is projected for the second
half of this year, subject to downside risks,” the ECB’s
president said at a press conference in Frankfurt. The central
bank left its benchmark  interest rate  at a record low of 0.75
percent today, matching estimates from  54 of 56 economists  in a
Bloomberg survey. Two had predicted a cut to 0.5 percent.  In the U.K., the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy
Committee held its  key rate  at a record low of 0.5 percent and
maintained bond purchases at 375 billion pounds ($570 billion).
Today’s meeting was the first since Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  gave the bank more flexibility over how long it
takes to meet its 2 percent inflation target. The median
estimates in Bloomberg surveys of economists had predicted no
change for either policy.  European Markets  National benchmark indexes declined in 16 of the 18
western-European markets.  Germany ’s DAX dropped 0.7 percent and
 France ’s CAC 40 lost 0.8 percent. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index
retreated 1.2 percent.  Banca Generali sank 5.1 percent to 13.85 euros for its
longest streak of losses in more than five years. Assicurazioni
Generali sold 12 percent of the Trieste, Italy-based private
bank for 185 million euros. Italy’s biggest insurer holds a 51.5
percent controlling stake following the transaction.  EADS (EAD)  declined 2.7 percent to 39.25 euros after a term sheet
obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed that Stichting
Administratiekantoor Spanish EADS Shares Warehousing Foundation
is selling 9.6 million shares in the aerospace company. Two
people familiar with the transaction said that the shares were
priced at 39.75 euros apiece.  Iliad SA decreased 4.2 percent to 160.50 euros. Bank of
America Corp. lowered its rating on the stock to neutral from
buy, with analysts led by Emmet Kelly saying the share price
already assumes “blue sky scenarios” for the low-cost mobile-
phone operator.  Huhtamaki, BTG  Huhtamaki Oyj (HUH1V)  fell 2 percent to 15.25 euros. The packaging
company said the Finnish Cultural Foundation, a  shareholder ,
sold as many as 2.79 million shares, reducing its stake in the
business to less than 15 percent.  BTG rose 1 percent to 362.1 pence. The drugmaker  forecast
revenue  of 230 million pounds in 2013, compared with an earlier
prediction of 205 million pounds to 215 million pounds.  Portuguese banks rallied today as the nation’s PSI 20 Index
rebounded from its biggest selloff in 17 months. Banco Comercial
Portugues SA and Banco Espirito Santo SA, the two biggest
lenders, both surged more than 4.5 percent. Portugal’s
parliament rejected late yesterday a censure motion brought by
the largest opposition party against Prime Minister  Pedro Passos
Coelho ’s government.  Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. gained 2.9 percent to 55.60
euros, its biggest advance since November. The world’s largest
provider of  kidney dialysis  said it will  buy back  as much as 385
million euros of shares over the next six months.  The number of shares changing hands today in Stoxx 600-
