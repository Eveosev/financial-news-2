Chile’s peso rose to the highest in
a week as traders tempered bets that the central bank will
intervene to limit gains as the currency strengthens.  The peso appreciated 0.1 percent to 471.85 per  U.S. dollar 
as of 10:06 a.m. in Santiago, the strongest since March 28.  The  exchange rate  is “consistent with its long-term
fundamentals,” the central bank said in a report this week.
Previously traders had speculated that the central bank would
intervene if the currency strengthened beyond 470 per dollar.  Now, “it’s hard to think there’d be intervention at 465,”
said Cristian Donoso, a trader at Banchile Corredores de Bolsa
SA in Santiago.  The peso appreciates on average more on Thursdays than
other days of the week as mining companies sell dollars to meet
payroll and other commitments on Fridays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
