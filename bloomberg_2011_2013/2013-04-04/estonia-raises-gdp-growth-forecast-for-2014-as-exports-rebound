Estonia raised next year’s economic-
growth forecast as exports in the newest euro-area member resume
their expansion and wage growth boosts domestic demand.  Gross domestic product  will probably expand 3.6 percent in
2014, more than last August’s 3.4 percent forecast, the  Finance
Ministry , based in the capital, Tallinn, said today in an e-
mailed outlook. It kept this year’s projection at 3 percent.  Estonia, which adopted the euro in 2011, has weathered
 Europe ’s debt crisis as Swedish and Finnish demand for its
electronics and wood products helped its economy recover from a
20 percent contraction in the wake of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc.’s 2008 demise. GDP expanded 3.2 percent last year, the
European Union’s third-fastest pace behind Latvia and  Lithuania .  The  budget deficit  will probably widen to 0.5 percent of
GDP this year from a preliminary 0.3 percent in 2012, the
Finance Ministry said. That’s less than the 0.7 percent
shortfall set in this year’s budget. The gap may be 0.1 percent
in 2014, the ministry said.  Consumer prices  will probably rise an average 3.4 percent
this year, less than the 3.5 percent advance seen in August and
last year’s 3.9 percent increase, according to the ministry.
Inflation may slow to 2.8 percent next year, in line with the
previous forecast, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
