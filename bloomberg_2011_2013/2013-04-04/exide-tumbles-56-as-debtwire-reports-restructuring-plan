Exide Technologies (XIDE) , a maker of lead-
acid batteries, dropped the most in almost nine years after
Debtwire reported that it hired Lazard Ltd. and Akin Gump
Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP to advise on a restructuring.  Exide  sank  48 percent to $1.37 at the close in New York for
the biggest one-day decline since April 21, 2004. The Milton,
Georgia-based company has tumbled 60 percent this year.  The company confirmed in a statement today after the close
that it had hired the Lazard investment bank. Exide initially
engaged Deutsche Bank AG last year to lead a global refinancing,
Debtwire said. Management is now considering restructuring
alternatives amid capital issues and a looming September
maturity on its convertible notes, the news service said, citing
sources it didnâ€™t identify.  The company had cash and cash equivalents of $80 million as
of Dec. 31, according to its most recent earnings report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
