Canadian stocks  fell for the fourth
day, the longest streak of losses since November, as commodities
extended a week-long drop and U.S. jobless claims rose more than
forecast.  Petrominerales Ltd. declined 4.5 percent as oil prices
retreated. OceanaGold Corp. fell 3.4 percent after the metal
slumped toward a  bear market . Lululemon Athletica Inc., the
yoga-wear maker that recalled women’s pants, gained 1.9 percent
after saying its chief product officer will step down.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 23.45
points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,398.67 at 10:19 a.m. in Toronto,
poised for the lowest close since Dec. 28. The benchmark gauge
declined 2.1 percent yesterday, erasing its gain for the year as
concern over global economic growth weighed on commodities.  Gold extended losses for a third day and silver, platinum
and palladium declined. Oil fell for a second day as more
Americans than projected filed applications for unemployment
benefits last week and the euro weakened against the dollar.  Commodity shares account for 40 percent of the benchmark
equity index by weighting.  U.S. data showed today that jobless claims increased by
28,000 to 385,000 in the week ended March 30, the highest since
Nov. 24. The median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
called for a drop to 353,000.  Central banks in Japan and Europe reassured investors that
they will keep economies awash in cash to bolster growth. ECB
President  Mario Draghi  said policy will remain accommodative
after the central bank kept its benchmark rate at 0.75 percent.
The Bank of Japan said it will buy longer-term  government bonds 
as part of its asset-purchase program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
