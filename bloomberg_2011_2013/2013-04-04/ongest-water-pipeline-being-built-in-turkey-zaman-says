Turkey  is working to finish a 9,300-
kilometer (5,800-mile) water pipeline in the Harran Plain that
when done later this year will be the world’s longest, the
Today’s Zaman newspaper reported.  The pipeline in southeastern Turkey, most of it installed
1.6 meters (5.2 feet) underground, is part of the 200 million-
lira ($111 million) Harran Plain Closed Drainage Project, the
paper said, citing Gursel Kusek, an official from the Ministry
of Food, Agriculture and Animal Husbandry.  Kusek told the paper that the project is taking place to
help address high levels of total dissolved solids in the
shallow groundwater due to logging, irrigation, rising water
tables and drainage problems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
