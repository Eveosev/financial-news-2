European Central Bank President
Mario Draghi declined to comment about what he said when Italian
President Giorgio Napolitano telephoned him last week for advice
on the country’s political deadlock.  “That’s what usually humans do, when they receive phone
calls,” Draghi, previously head of  Italy ’s central bank, said
today in  Frankfurt  when asked in a press conference about the
call. “You respond to them.”  “That’s it,” he said. “There’s nothing to say about what
we discussed, and the same thing about the situation in Italy.”  Draghi was sought out after more than a month of
negotiations between Napolitano and Italian political leaders
failed to yield a majority in the country’s divided parliament.
After speaking with Draghi, who left the Bank of Italy in
October 2011, Napolitano appointed 10 advisers to seek common
ground among the rival factions.  “I wouldn’t comment on Italy,” Draghi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
