Federal Reserve Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen  said the  Bank of Japan (8301) ’s plan to double its monetary base
is appropriate to end the country’s deflation.  “What Japan is doing is something that is in their own
best interest,” Yellen said today in response to audience
questions after a speech in Washington. “It’s something that,
if successful, will be good for stimulating growth in the global
economy and will be good for us too.”  The BOJ will double the monetary base by the end of 2014
through buying  government bonds , in Japan’s biggest round of
quantitative easing, the central bank said in Tokyo. At stake is
the credibility of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic program
-- dubbed Abenomics -- and the chances of ending two decades of
stagnation and meeting a 2 percent inflation goal.  “Taking an aggressive approach to try to end deflation is
something I certainly understand,” Yellen said.  “Nominal income, nominal GDP in Japan is slightly lower
than it was 20 years ago,” she said. “That’s really remarkable
and it’s resulted in all kinds of problems for Japan.”  To contact the reporters on this story:  Joshua Zumbrun in  Washington  at
