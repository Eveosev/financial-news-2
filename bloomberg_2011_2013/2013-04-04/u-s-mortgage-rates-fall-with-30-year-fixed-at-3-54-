Mortgage rates  in the U.S. fell,
decreasing borrowing costs as the housing market moves into its
second year of recovery.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 3.54
percent in the week ended today, down from 3.57 percent, McLean,
Virginia-based  Freddie Mac (FMCC)  said in a statement. The average 15-
year rate slipped to 2.74 percent from 2.76 percent.  U.S. home prices rose 10.2 percent in February from a year
earlier, the most since March 2006, Irvine, California-based
CoreLogic Inc. said yesterday. It was the 12th consecutive month
of year-over-year gains as low borrowing costs drove demand for
a thin supply of homes.  “The house-price rebound shows no sign of spluttering
out,”  Paul Diggle , property economist for  Capital Economics  in
 London , wrote in a note to clients after CoreLogic’s data were
released. “Nor should it. After all, supply conditions are
still very tight.”  The  inventory  of homes for sale rose in February after
dropping to a 12-year low in the previous month, according to
the National Association of Realtors.  The  Mortgage Bankers Association ’s index of home-loan
applications dropped 4 percent in the period ended March 29
after a 7.7 percent gain the prior week. The  refinance  gauge
fell 5.6 percent, while the  purchase  index rose 1.4 percent, the
Washington-based group reported yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
