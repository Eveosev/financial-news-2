Total SA bought another cargo of
 North Sea  Forties crude, bringing its total to six since March
27 and raising the price to the most in more than two weeks.  A potential strike by energy workers in  Norway  could shut
as many as 20 oil and gas platforms less than a year after a
previous labor dispute disrupted output in western Europe’s
biggest producer.  North Sea  Vitol Group sold Forties to Total for loading from April 18
to April 20 at 25 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent,
according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts pricing window. That compares with a trade
yesterday at a discount of 30 cents and is the highest since
March 20, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Vitol has
been the seller on five out of the six cargoes that Total has
bought.  Total also bid unsuccessfully for April 21-24 loading
Forties at minus 25 cents, the survey showed.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days narrowed by 14 cents to a discount of 29 cents a
barrel to Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for May settlement traded at $105.84 a barrel on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $108.65 in the previous session. The June
contract was at $105.65, a discount of 19 cents to May.  The Industry Energy union in Norway could order as many as
1,559 workers to walk out from 6 a.m. on April 8 if wage
negotiations between private sector workers and employers passes
a deadline at the end of April 7 without a deal, it said in a
statement. More than 300 of the employees work at two supply
bases for platforms in the North and Norwegian seas including
Troll, Oseberg, Aasgard, Draugen and Heidrun.  Crude shipments from Dansk Undergrunds Consortium, the
producer part-owned by A.P. Moeller Maersk A/S, will drop to
five cargoes in May, a loading program obtained by  Bloomberg
News  showed. DUC is the first schedule released of the 12 main
North Sea grades. The most important four, Brent, Forties,
Oseberg and Ekofisk, are expected to be issued tomorrow.  Mediterranean/Urals  Eni SpA bid without finding a seller for 80,000 to 100,000
metric tons of Russian Urals at discounts of 70 cents and $1
respectively to Dated Brent on a delivered basis to Augusta,
 Italy , the Platts survey showed. That compares with a Feb. 22
deal at minus 90 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Urals discount to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
narrowed by 28 cents to 86 cents a barrel, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That’s the highest since Feb. 5. In northwest
 Europe , the  discount  was at $2.20 a barrel, compared with minus
$2.25 in the previous session.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend rose by 32 cents to $3.60
a barrel more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
That’s the most since Oct. 6, 2011.  Hindustan Petroleum Corp.,  India ’s third-largest state
refiner, is seeking to buy crude for loading from June 1 to June
30, according to two traders with knowledge of the matter, who
asked not to be identified.  To contact the reporter on this story:
