Transocean Ltd. (RIG) ’s management
“destroyed approximately $11 billion of shareholder value” by
buying Global  Santa Fe  and Aker, billionaire investor  Carl Icahn 
said.  The company’s current plan to pay down debt and invest in
building new assets will destroy another $3.6 billion in
shareholder value, Icahn wrote in a letter to shareholders
today.  Icahn, who said he controls about  5.43 percent  of
Transocean, is urging fellow shareholders to support his
proposal to increase the company’s dividend to $4 a share and
elect three new board members. The Vernier, Switzerland-based
offshore drilling company has proposed a $2.24 dividend and
defended its 13 board members.  “It is evident that Icahn has failed to invest the
appropriate time and analysis necessary to understand the
cyclical and capital-intensive nature of the offshore drilling
industry in general, and Transocean’s business in particular,”
Brian Maddox, a Transocean spokesman who works for FTI
Consulting, said in an e-mailed statement. “His focus is
clearly on achieving potential short-term gains at the expense
of the company’s future.”  Transocean fell 0.1 percent to $49.87 at 11:45 a.m. in New
York. The shares have gained 12 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
