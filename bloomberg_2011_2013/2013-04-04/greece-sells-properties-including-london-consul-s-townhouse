Greece  sold four properties outside
the country, including the U.K. consul’s residence in  London , as
the government raises money to pay its debts.  The townhouse in London’s Holland Park neighborhood was
sold for 23.3 million pounds ($35.2 million), the Hellenic
Republic Asset Development Fund said in an e-mailed statement
late yesterday. A property in Nicosia, Cyprus, fetched 8.3
million euros and real estate in Brussels and Belgrade was sold
for a combined 5.3 million euros.  Greece has pledged to generate 11.1 billion euros from
asset deals by 2016. Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras said in
January that property transactions rather than budget cuts
should be used to improve Greece’s balance sheet. Real estate
makes up about 75 percent of the state’s assets.  The sales process for one property in Tashkent, Uzbekistan,
and another in  Ljubljana , Slovenia, will start within 15 days,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
