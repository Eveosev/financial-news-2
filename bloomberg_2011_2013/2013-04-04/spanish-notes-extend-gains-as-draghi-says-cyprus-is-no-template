Spanish two-year notes extended
their gains as European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said
the rescue of Cyprus is not a template for future bailouts in
the euro region.  The yield on Spainâ€™s 2.75 percent securities maturing March
2015 fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 2.15
percent. The 10-year yield was little changed at 4.92 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
