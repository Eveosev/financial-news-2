(Corrects currency conversion in second paragraph.)  Jeremy Hall, Singapore-based
director of Japanese equities at Henderson Global Investors
Ltd., which oversees about $99 billion, comments on the market
impact of the  Bank of Japan (8301) ’s efforts to end deflation.  BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda began his campaign to end 15
years of deflation with a strengthened stimulus program that
will see the central bank buy 7 trillion yen ($73 billion) of
bonds a month. Policy makers set a 2 percent inflation target
within two years.  On BOJ policy:  “It’s a pretty comprehensive spread of proposals. It’s a
pretty strong statement of conviction from the Bank of  Japan .  ‘‘Obviously, the BOJ can’t do it alone. You also need to
see a reciprocal action over the longer term on the structural
side as well.”  On market valuation:  “I’m still quite constructive on the outlook for Japanese
equities. Valuations are still pretty cheap. It is dependent on
delivery of improving earnings.”  On inflation:  “The inflation target is aggressive. The fact that they’ve
set the target with a time scale is very important.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
