Brett Ersoff and John Herman, who
took over the commercial-mortgage bond group at  UBS AG (UBSN)  last week
after the group’s head departed for Bank of America Corp., have
left the bank, said two people familiar with the moves who asked
not to be identified because they haven’t been announced.  Ersoff and Herman were named co-heads of real-estate
finance and mortgage-backed securities after Kenneth Cohen
exited to become the global head of commercial real estate at
Bank of America in New York, UBS confirmed on March 28.  Megan Stinson, a spokeswoman for Switzerland’s largest
lender, said she couldn’t comment on the latest departures,
reported earlier today by Debtwire. Ersoff and Herman couldn’t
immediately be reached for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
