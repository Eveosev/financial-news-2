Morocco received no offers in a
tender for U.S. durum wheat to be imported under preferential
tariffs, national grain office ONICL wrote in a statement
published  online  and dated yesterday.  The office had said March 21 it was tendering for 160,000
metric tons of the grain, to be delivered by May 31 at the
latest. Durum is the hard variety of wheat used to make
couscous, a staple dish in western North Africa, and pasta.  To contact the reporter on this story:
