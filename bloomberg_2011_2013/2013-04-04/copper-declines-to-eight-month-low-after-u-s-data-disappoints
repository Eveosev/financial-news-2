Copper slumped for a fifth day to
the lowest level in eight months as worse-than-estimated U.S.
economic data spurred concern that growth is slowing in the
world’s second-biggest user amid increasing stockpiles.  The contract for three-month delivery slid as much as 0.4
percent to $7,356.25 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange,
the lowest price since Aug. 3, and traded at $7,370 by 10:22 a.m.
in  Tokyo . Futures for May delivery fell 0.2 percent to $3.3250 a
pound on the Comex in  New York . China’s financial markets are
closed today and tomorrow for national holidays.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s index of U.S. non-
manufacturing businesses, which covers almost 90 percent of the
economy, fell to 54.4 in March from 56 in February, the Tempe,
Arizona-based group said yesterday. The median forecast of 73
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 55.5. Readings above 50
signal expansion.  “Yesterday’s disappointing U.S. data kept downward
pressure amid an absence of Chinese buyers today,” said  Tetsu Emori , the chief  fund manager  at Astmax Asset Management Inc. in
Tokyo. Increasing inventories also sent copper lower, he said.  Copper  inventories  tracked by the LME rose for a 33rd
session to 572,325 tons, daily exchange figures showed. Orders
to remove copper from LME warehouses increased 3.7 percent to
120,975 tons. They jumped 87 percent in the past week to the
highest since February 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
