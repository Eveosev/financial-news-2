Spot jet fuel in  Los Angeles  gained
to the highest level against futures in more than three weeks as
 BP Plc (BP/)  performed maintenance on a jet fuel hydrotreater at the
Carson oil refinery, the second-largest in  California .  The 266,000-barrel-a-day Carson plant was scheduled to shut
the treater for planned repairs beginning April 1, a person with
direct knowledge of the schedule said March 28. The work is
expected to last until at least April 8, a person familiar with
operations at the refinery said today.  Jet fuel in Los Angeles strengthened 1.25 cents against
ultra-low-sulfur diesel futures traded on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  to a premium of 5.75 cents a gallon at 2:13
p.m. East Coast time, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s
the highest level for the fuel since March 11.  The Carson refinery plans to flare gases from April 8
through April 15, London-based BP said in a notice to the  South
Coast Air Quality Management District . The flaring isn’t related
to a breakdown, the filing shows.  Jet fuel production in California slipped 0.2 percent in

premium of 8.5 cents a gallon.  San Francisco  The  premium  for Carbob in San Francisco versus the fuel in

third straight day, losing $1.26 to $18.53 a barrel at 2:21 p.m.
 New York  time, the lowest level in more than a week. The spread,
a measure of refining profitability, hit a one-year low of $3.86
a barrel in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
