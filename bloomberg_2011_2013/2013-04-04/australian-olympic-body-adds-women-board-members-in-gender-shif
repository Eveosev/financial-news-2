The Australian Olympic Committee
will more than double the female membership of its board to
improve the gender balance of its executive.  Former Olympians Kitty Chiller, Danielle Woodward and
Nicole Livingstone will join Helen Brownlee and current athlete
representative Kim Crow, the only rower to win more than one
 medal  at last year’s London Games, among the 12 elected
positions on the AOC’s board next month, the Sydney-based
organization said today.  “Women comprise 45 percent of our Summer Olympic team and
50 percent of our Winter Olympic team,” AOC President  John Coates  said in an e-mailed statement. “In recent times they are
winning the bulk of our Olympic medals, it is only right that
women therefore have a greater presence on our board.”  The shift echoes similar moves in cricket, rugby union and
rugby league to have more women among the decision makers in
Australian sports.  Catherine Harris, the chairwoman of Australia’s largest
independent fresh produce retailer, was appointed to the
inaugural Australian Rugby League Commission last year. The
Australian Rugby Union named Ann Sherry, the chief executive
officer of cruise ship operator Carnival Australia, as its first
female director in July, while former Ericsson Australia
managing director Jacquie Hey broke the 107-year male domination
of Cricket  Australia ’s board in October when she became its
first female independent director.  To contact the reporter on this story:
