Lance Armstrong  withdrew from a
Masters swimming meet after the sport’s governing body said he
should be banned from the event for his confessed drug cheating
in cycling.  Rob Butcher, executive director of U.S. Masters Swimming,
said Armstrong’s agent informed him this morning that the former
cyclist would pull out of  three events  at the Masters South
Central Zone Swimming Championships at the University of Texas
after objections from the sport’s federation, which goes by the
French acronym FINA.  After talks with FINA, “we informed Lance’s team that he’s
not eligible to compete in our events,” Butcher said in a
telephone interview. “He can still swim in USMS practices.”  Masters events are for older swimmers. Armstrong, 41, was
entered in the 40-44 age group, the  Associated Press  said.  Lausanne, Switzerland-based FINA said in a statement the
event is subject to the lifetime ban Armstrong received from
Olympic-connected sports after a U.S. Anti-Doping Agency
investigation documented drug use throughout his career.  Bill Stapleton, Armstrong’s agent, didn’t immediately
return a telephone call seeking comment on the decision.  Armstrong said in a television interview that he’d used
banned substances and methods throughout his career, which
included seven  Tour de France  wins.  To contact the reporter on this story:
