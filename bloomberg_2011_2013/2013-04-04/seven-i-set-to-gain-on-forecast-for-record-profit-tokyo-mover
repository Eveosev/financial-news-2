Seven & I Holdings Co. (3382)  was bid
higher in pre-market trading in  Tokyo  after the owner of the 7-
Eleven convenience-store brand said adding stores in Japan and
overseas will help boost profit to a record this year.  The retailer was bid at 3,305 yen as of 8:45 a.m. in Tokyo,
7 percent higher than yesterday’s close. Net income may rise 23
percent to 170 billion yen ($1.8 billion) in the year ending
February 2014, the Tokyo-based retailer said in a statement
yesterday after the market closed.  The company plans to open a record 1,500 new convenience
stores in Japan this fiscal year, tapping demand as consumers
increasingly rely on the shops for meals formerly purchased at
grocery stores or fast-food outlets. The operator of Ito-Yokado
supermarkets and 7-Eleven convenience stores,  Japan ’s biggest
chain, said operating profit will probably rise 15 percent to
340 billion yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
