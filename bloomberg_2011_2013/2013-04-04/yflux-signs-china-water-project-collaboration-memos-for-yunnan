Hyflux Ltd. (HYF) , Singapore’s largest
publicly traded water company, signed memos of understanding for
project collaborations with the prefectural governments of
Chuxiong and Qujing in China’s Yunnan province.  The investment value of the water and environmental
projects in the two cities is estimated at as much as 3.2
billion yuan ($515 million), Hyflux, which built Singapore’s
first water-recycling plant and China’s biggest seawater
reverse-osmosis desalination facility in Tianjin City, said
today in a statement.  The projects covered under the MOUs include development of
water recycling, wastewater treatment and potable water
treatment plants, and related infrastructure. Hyflux gets about
92 percent of its revenue from municipal contracts.  The company is building the world’s largest seawater
reverse-osmosis desalination plant in Magtaa,  Algeria .  To contact the reporter on this story:
