Gasoline dropped, following crude
lower after U.S. unemployment benefits claims increased more
than forecast. The crack spread on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  widened for the first time in a week.  Futures fell a fifth straight day as  jobless claims  rose by
28,000 to 385,000 in the week ended March 30, the highest level
since Nov. 24, Labor Department figures showed today. Gasoline’s
 crack spread  versus WTI widened 32 cents to $28.26 a barrel. The
May-June gasoline spread narrowed, indicating ample supplies.  “There’s an unease on the macro side that the jobs number
didn’t help,” said  Andrew Lebow , a senior vice president at
Jefferies Bache LLC in  New York . “There’s also follow-through
from this week of heavy selling.”  Gasoline for May delivery fell 2.62 cents to $2.8878 a
gallon at 10:39 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Trading volume on the Nymex was 144 percent above the 100-day
average. Prices touched $2.8679, the lowest intraday level since
Feb. 28.  The fuel’s  spread  over Brent slipped 20 cents to $15.08 a
barrel. The May contract’s premium to June gasoline narrowed
0.41 cent to 0.18 cent a gallon.  Ultra-low-sulfur-diesel for May delivery fell 5.17 cents to
$2.9503 a gallon on volume that was 35 percent above the 100-day
average at 9:28 a.m.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, fell 0.4 cent to
$3.636 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. Prices are 29.2
cents below a year earlier after falling in March for the first
time in 10 years, according to AAA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
