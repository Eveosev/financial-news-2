The  Big East  conference will become
the American Athletic Conference at the end of the 2012-13
sports season, Commissioner Mike Aresco said.  “Our name is a nod to tradition, but at the same time
makes clear our determination to be a conference with national
impact and appeal,” Aresco said in a statement.  The conference’s board yesterday gave unanimous approval to
the new name.  The AAC will include Central Florida, Cincinnati,
Connecticut, East Carolina, Houston, Memphis, Southern Methodist,
 South Florida , Temple, Tulane and Tulsa.  The U.S. Naval Academy will become a football-only member
in 2015. With 12 football schools in the fold by 2015, it will
play a football championship game.  The Big East turned over its moniker to the so-called
Catholic 7, a group of schools whose top sports program is men’s
basketball. Their new league, which has expanded to 10 members,
begins July 1.  The new Big East members are  Butler,   Creighton,   Xavier, 
Georgetown, St. John’s, Villanova,  Seton Hall , Providence,
Marquette and DePaul.  To contact the reporter on this story:
