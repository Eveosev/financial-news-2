Centum Investment Co.,  Kenya ’s
largest publicly traded investment group, fell the most in six
weeks as a technical indicator showed it may have risen too far.  The stock slid for a second day, declining 6.4 percent to
19.90 shillings by 12:27 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi, the
biggest decline on a closing basis since Feb. 20. About 48
percent of the three-month daily average of shares traded.  Centum had a 10-day rally that pushed its 14-day relative
strength  index  to 85 on April 2, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. A reading above 70 signals that the stock is poised
to fall. The company’s RSI has been above 70 since March 26.  “Before it started falling yesterday it had actually risen
74 percent from the start of the year so investors are taking
profit,” Faith Atiti, a research analyst at Nairobi-based NIC
Securities Ltd., said by phone.  Shares in the company that invests in banks, breweries and
 food processing  have climbed 61 percent since the start of the
year, the eighth-best performing Kenyan stock, outpacing the 28
percent gain on the  Nairobi Securities Exchange All-Share Index. (NSEASI)   To contact the reporter on this story:
