Paul Horsnell , the head of
commodities research at  Barclays Plc (BARC) , has left the company,
according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.  Horsnell left last week after 10 years at Barclays in
London, according to the person, who asked not to be identified
because the information is confidential. The person didn’t say
why he left. Jon Laycock, a London-based spokesman for the bank,
declined to comment when contacted today. Horsnell couldn’t
immediately be reached by phone.  Barclays was among the quickest banks to forecast the surge
in  oil prices  during Horsnell’s tenure. Brent crude rallied to a
record of $147.50 a barrel in mid-2008 from $30.17 at the end of
2003, the year Horsnell joined Barclays from JPMorgan Chase &
Co. Until yesterday, Barclays’s 2013 price forecasts were the
most bullish of 44 tracked by Bloomberg.  Amrita Sen left Horsnell’s team in July before starting
London-based consultancy Energy Aspects Ltd. The Barclays
commodities research team currently includes  Kevin Norrish ,
Helima Croft, Miswin Mahesh and Sijn Cheng, according to a note
issued yesterday.  The Financial Times  reported  Horsnell’s departure earlier
today, without saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
