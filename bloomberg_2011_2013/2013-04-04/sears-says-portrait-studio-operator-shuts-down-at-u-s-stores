Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD)  said  CPI Corp. (CPIC) ,
the company that operated photo portrait studios at the
retailer’s stores, is ceasing U.S. operations.  “We are working with CPI to ensure that it fulfills its
outstanding orders and provides ordered pictures to our members
and customers,” Howard Riefs, a spokesman for Hoffman Estates,
Illinois-based Sears, said in an e-mail today. CPI operated the
studio under license, he said.  Sears is “exploring all options” to continue photo
services, Riefs said. Customers who have had recent picture
sessions can order portraits on the Sears website through April
18, according to a  statement  on the retailer’s website.  CPI, based in St. Louis,  said on its website  that “after
many years of providing family portrait photography, we are sad
to announce that all of our U.S. portrait studios are now
closed.” The company’s website said it offered photo services
in about 3,100 North American locations, mainly at stores of
Sears and  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)   To contact the reporter on this story:
