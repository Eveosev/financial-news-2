Coffee sales in  Vietnam , the biggest
grower of robusta beans used by  Nestle SA (NESN)  in instant drinks,
climbed as local prices surged last month and on speculation
that rain will ease a drought in the main growing region.  Sales probably reached 1 million metric tons, or 69 percent
of the 2012-2013 crop, compared with 70 percent sold a year
earlier, according to the median of 11 trader and shipper
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Farmers had sold 57 percent of
the  harvest , a survey on March 7 showed.  Rising sales in Vietnam may pressure robusta futures traded
in  London , already down 6.5 percent from a five-month high in
March. Rains forecast for Dak Lak, which grows about 30 percent
of the crop, could potentially ease a drought that threatens to
cut supplies at a time when exports from  Indonesia , the third-
largest shipper, are falling because of higher domestic demand.
Vietnam’s harvest starting October will drop at least 10 percent
because of the dryness, a survey published March 15 showed.  “This time last year, I still had about half of my crop,”
said Dang Huu Hung, a farmer in  Dak Lak  province. “Now I’ve
sold all my coffee from the 2012-2013 crop because prices got
quite high and also because I need to pay for irrigation and
fertilizer costs.”  Beans traded in Dak Lak gained 1.4 percent to 42,600 dong
($2.04) a kilogram (2.2 pounds) yesterday, extending their
annual gain to 11 percent,  data  from the Daklak Trade & Tourism
Center show. Prices reached 45,500 dong on March 11, the highest
level since September 2011. The 2012-2013 harvest may have
dropped 13 percent to 1.44 million tons from a record 1.65
million tons a year earlier, the latest survey shows.  Crop Prospects  Areas in the province will receive 15 millimeters to 25
millimeters through April 10, according to the Meteorology and
Hydrology Department. Water levels in rivers and streams will be
lower than average in previous years, it said in a report. The
government said Feb. 26 that drought would hurt the crop.  “There has been some rain, but quite little in amount,”
said Le Tien Hung, Dak Lak-based deputy director of Sept. 2nd
Import-Export Co. “We can’t rule out the drought threat yet.”  Robusta for delivery in July traded at $2,072 a ton on NYSE
Liffe in London yesterday. Prices rose to an intraday high of
$2,216 a ton on March 13, the highest since Oct. 3. Futures are
still up 7.7 percent this year. Robusta will trade from $1,900
to $2,100 a ton this month as crop prospects improve in Vietnam,
 Edward Meir , an analyst at INTL FCStone Inc., said April 2.  Arabica for May delivery fell 0.5 percent to $1.387 a pound
on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . Robusta’s discount to the more
expensive arabica beans, brewed by  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) , was about
44.71 cents a pound, down 21 percent this year after a 61
percent plunge in 2012.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
