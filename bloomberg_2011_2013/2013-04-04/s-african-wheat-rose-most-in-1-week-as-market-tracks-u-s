South African wheat futures rose the
most in more than a week, tracking U.S. prices which climbed
because of cold weather that may delay spring planting.  Wheat for delivery in May, the most active contract,
increased 0.9 percent to 3,409.80 rand ($368) a metric ton, the
most since March 22, on the South African Futures Exchange.  The May contract for wheat strengthened as much as 1.3
percent to $7.055 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade before
easing 0.3 percent to $6.9450 at 12:30 p.m. in  London .  “Wheat in America traded higher,” Lindy van Blommestein,
a trader at Farmwise Grains (Pty) Ltd., said by phone from
Johannesburg.  Soil temperatures in parts of the U.S. Plains fell to as
low as 28 degrees Fahrenheit, well below the 37 degrees needed
to start planting,  Bryce Anderson , an agricultural meteorologist
at DTN, said in an interview from Omaha,  Nebraska  today.  South Africa  is a net importer of wheat and sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s largest producer of the grain after Ethiopia. The
nation is the region’s biggest importer after Nigeria and Sudan,
according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.  White corn for delivery in July declined 2.7 percent to
2,136.40 rand a ton, while the yellow variety for delivery in
the same month dropped 2 percent to 2,102 rand a ton by the
midday close in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
