The U.K.  Home Office , responsible
for immigration and counter-terrorism, and the Department for
Communities and Local Government, responsible for local
authorities and engagement with minority communities, are to
share central London headquarters to reduce costs.  The move, scheduled for mid-2014, will see Eric Pickles’
communities department, which numbers 1,200 workers, move across
town to share with Theresa May’s Home Office staff. The move
will help cut 24 million pounds ($37 million) annually in office
costs and reduce Pickles’ departmental spending by 8 million
pounds, the Home Office said in an e-mailed statement  “As budgets continue to tighten we want to target
resources where they are needed most,” Helen Kilpatrick,
director-general of finance and corporate services at the Home
Office, said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporters on this story:
