Anne-Marie Slaughter, the Princeton
University professor and former State Department official, will
become head of the  New America Foundation .  Slaughter, 54, the former dean of Princeton’s Woodrow
Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, begins the
new post on Sept. 1, New America said in a  statement . She will
become an emerita professor at Princeton, the university said in
a separate  release  today.  She replaces Steve Coll at the nonprofit public policy
institute. Coll was tapped last month to become dean of Columbia
University’s Graduate School of Journalism.  Slaughter’s story last year in the Atlantic, “Why Women
Still Can’t Have It All,” prompted a debate about the
challenges for women who juggle work and family.  To contact the reporter on this story:
