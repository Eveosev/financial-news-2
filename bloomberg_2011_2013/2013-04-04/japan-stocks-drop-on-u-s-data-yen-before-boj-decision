Japan ’s  Topix Index (TPX)  jumped the most
in eight weeks as the yen slumped after the  Bank of Japan (8301) 
doubled monthly bond purchases in its first policy decision
since Haruhiko Kuroda took over as governor.  The Topix climbed 2.7 percent to close at 1,037.76 in
 Tokyo , the biggest gain since Feb. 6. The gauge reversed a 2
percent loss after the decision, with more than seven stocks
rising for each that fell. The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  added
2.2 percent to 12,634.54. Volume was 42 percent above the 30-day
average. The yield on the country’s 10-year government bonds
slumped 12.5 basis points to a record low of 0.425 percent.  “We’re getting a sea change in monetary policy and it’s
happening fast, said Kazuyuki Terao, Tokyo-based chief
investment officer at Allianz Global Investors Japan Co. ‘‘That
was what markets had expected, but it’s still positive.”  Sumitomo Realty & Development Co. surged 10 percent to pace
gains among property companies, which rose the most among the 33
Topix industry groups.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , a carmaker that gets 81
percent of its revenue outside Japan, climbed 3.4 percent,
bouncing back from a 3 percent decline. Fujifilm Holdings Corp.,
which has a bird flu treatment under regulatory review, rose 5.7
percent after the disease took a third life in  China .  The Topix has rallied 44 percent since mid-November amid
optimism Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s new government and the Bank
of Japan would take more steps to beat deflation. The  gauge 
traded at 15.6 times estimated earnings on average, compared
with 14 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.6 for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Kuroda Stimulus  BOJ Governor Kuroda began his campaign to end 15 years of
deflation with a strengthened stimulus program that will see the
central bank buy 7 trillion yen ($74 billion) of bonds a month.
Kuroda is scheduled to speak at a press conference today after
the close of markets.  The central bank today streamlined its asset purchases by
unifying separate programs, temporarily suspending a self-
imposed cap on some bond holdings and pledging to buy longer-
term debt.  Real estate and banking shares led gains on the Topix as
investors bought companies expected to benefit from asset
appreciation. Sumitomo Realty & Development, the nation’s third
largest property company by market value, jumped 10 percent to
4,165 yen. Mitsubishi Estate Co., the biggest by market value,
added 7.2 percent to 2,846 yen.  Mitsui Fudosan Co. (8801)   gained 7.8
percent to 2,930 yen.  Banks Rise  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s biggest
lender, advanced 5.5 percent to 578 yen.  Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc. (8316)  climbed 6.6 percent to 3,960 yen, while
 Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411)  rose 5.1 percent to 206 yen.  Exporters climbed as the yen slumped against all 16 major
counterparts, dropping as much as 2.6 percent to 95.56 per
dollar. Honda, Japan’s second largest carmaker by market value,
rose 3.4 percent to 3,645 yen.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , a maker of factory
robots that generates 76 percent of its revenue abroad, advanced
2.1 percent to 14,580 yen.  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  rose 0.3 percent. The measure
fell the most in five weeks yesterday, when ADP Research
Institute data showed U.S. companies boosted employment by
158,000 workers in March, less than a median economist forecast
of a 200,000 gain. The data came before the Labor Department’s
monthly payrolls report due April 5.  The Institute for Supply Management’s index of U.S. non-
manufacturing businesses fell to 54.4 in March from 56 in
February, the Tempe, Arizona-based group said yesterday. The
median forecast was 55.5. Readings above 50 signal expansion.  Fujifilm gained 5.7 percent to 1,879 yen. The company has a
drug under review by Japanese regulators that was found to be
more effective in combating bird flu virus than Tamiflu. A third
person was killed by a new strain of the virus, which has
infected at least nine people in eastern China since last month,
according to the Xinhua News Agency.  Astellas Pharma Inc. , Japan’s second largest drug maker by
market value, gained 5.8 percent to 5,220 yen. Chugai
Pharmaceutical Co. advanced 9.5 percent to 2,325 yen, while
Taiko Pharmaceutical Co. surged 17 percent to 1,038 yen.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  slid 3.6 percent
to 26.14 today, indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.5
percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
