The  University of Minnesota  named
Richard Pitino, the 30-year-old son of Louisville coach  Rick Pitino , as men’s basketball coach to succeed the fired Tubby Smith.  The younger Pitino will be introduced at a news conference
tomorrow and the terms of the agreement will be finished this
week, the Minneapolis-based school said on its  website .  He spent one season at  Florida  International in Miami
following three campaigns as an assistant to his father at
Louisville. He’s also been an assistant for the University of
Florida. Rick Pitino’s Cardinals are favored to win the National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, which begins its
Final Four in two days in Atlanta.  The Golden Panthers went 18-14 this season, posting an 11-9
mark in the Sun Belt Conference with a 65-63 loss to Western
Kentucky in the conference tournament championship. Florida
International was 8-21 a year ago.  Minnesota fired Smith on March 25 after six seasons
following the Golden Gophers’ loss in the Round of 32 at the
national tournament. The 61-year-old Smith was 124-81, including
46-62 in the  Big Ten Conference . He was given a six-year
contract to coach Texas Tech two days ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
