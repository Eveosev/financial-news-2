Afrisam Ltd., a South African cement
maker majority-owned by the Public Investment Corp., plans to
expand in the rest of  Africa  after overhauling its debt, Chief
Executive Officer Stephan Olivier said.  “The company is currently exploring new growth
opportunities in a number of countries,” Olivier said in an e-
mailed response to questions from Bloomberg yesterday. “These
will be announced upon finalization.”  Afrisam’s Tanzanian unit, Tanga Cement Company Co., plans
to add a second kiln and output will double, “allowing it to
meet increasing demand in the East African market which is
experiencing rapid economic development,” Olivier said. The
Johannesburg-based company, which has operations in  South
Africa ,  Lesotho , Botswana and Swaziland, targets a 9 percent
increase in production this year.  Afrisam agreed on a debt reduction of more than 15 billion
rand ($1.6 billion) with euro-denominated floating rate notes
settled through an injection of equity from PIC and investment
company Pembani Group.  “The company has not issued bonds,” Olivier said. “It
has secured private long-term funding from domestic banking and
financial institutions.”  The PIC, a state-owned company managing assets of about 1.2
trillion rand including government employee pension funds, owns
66 percent of the cement maker, data from Afrisam show. Pembani
Group owns 30.5 percent,  Holcim Ltd. (HOLN) , the world’s largest cement
maker, has 2 percent and Bunker Hills Investments Ltd. 1.5
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
