Wheat fell in  Chicago  after weekly
U.S. export sales declined and as rain forecast for parts of the
U.S. Plains may improve crop conditions there.  U.S. wheat-export sales fell to 315,984 metric tons in the
week through March 28, down from 828,624 tons in the prior week,
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  reported today. Old-crop
sales slumped to 141,156 tons from 580,324 tons.  “These are bad numbers and you have to go back several
weeks to see numbers as low,” Arnaud Saulais, a broker at
Starsupply Commodity Brokers in Nyon,  Switzerland , wrote in an
e-mailed reply to questions.  Wheat for delivery in May fell as much as 1.7 percent to
$6.845 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was at $6.89
by 8:49 a.m. local time.  “U.S. export sales are down 76 percent from the previous
week,” said Kieran Walsh, a grain broker at Aurel BCG in Paris.
While forecasts for rain may create some “hopeful” optimism,
“the most significant factor is the export number,” he said.  Episodes of light rain and some heavier rainfall this
weekend and into next week may help improve wheat conditions in
the central and southern Plains of the U.S., Joel Burgio, an
agricultural meteorologist at DTN, wrote in a report today.  Milling wheat for delivery in November traded on NYSE Liffe
in Paris advanced 0.2 percent to 214.50 euros ($275.60) a metric
ton, while the May contract climbed 0.5 percent to 241.75 euros
a ton.  “The price of U.S. soft-red winter wheat remains low
compared to the French price, but the demand for this type of
quality is low right now,” Saulais said.  Soybeans Drop  Soybeans fell for a second day in Chicago amid concern an
outbreak in  China  of a new bird-flu strain may curb meat
consumption, in turn reducing the oilseed’s use in  animal feed 
in the world’s biggest importer.  The H7N9 strain of avian influenza that emerged in eastern
China has infected at least 10 people and killed three of them,
according to the official Xinhua News Agency. The new cases may
stoke concern about a drop in poultry consumption, Paris-based
farm adviser Agritel wrote.  Soybeans for delivery in May slipped 0.5 percent to
$13.7325 a bushel in Chicago. Corn for delivery in May shed 0.5
percent to $6.385 a bushel, set to drop for a fourth session in
five.  To contact the reporter on this story:
