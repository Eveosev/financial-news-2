Maize lethal necrosis, a corn
disease first found in  Kenya  in 2011, has spread to  Uganda  in a
possible threat to the country’s food security, plant-disease
researcher CABI said.  The disease, which is caused by a double infection of the
maize chlorotic mottle virus and the sugarcane mosaic virus, has
been reported in eastern Uganda, CABI  wrote  on its website
today, citing the country’s agriculture ministry.  Uganda produces about 2.7 million metric tons of corn a
year and exports the grain to  South Sudan , Tanzania and Kenya,
meaning the disease’s spread could have an impact on other
countries, according to Wallingford, England-based CABI. Maize
lethal necrosis was found in Kenya’s Rift Valley province in
2011 and 2012 and has also been observed in Tanzania, the
researcher said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
