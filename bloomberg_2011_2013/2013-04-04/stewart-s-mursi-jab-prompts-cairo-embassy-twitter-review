The U.S. embassy in Cairo is
reviewing its social media policy after briefly shutting its
Twitter Inc. account, following Egyptian complaints about a post
regarding comedian  Jon Stewart ’s criticism of President Mohamed Mursi.  When the @USEmbassyCairo Twitter feed reappeared yesterday,
it was without an item about a segment on Stewart’s “Daily
Show” broadcast that took Mursi to task for the arrest of
Egyptian satirist Bassem Youssef, who had mocked the president’s
headgear and facility with the English language.  “Making fun of hats and the president’s English?” Stewart
said on the April 1 segment of his Comedy Central program.
Photos of Stewart and former President  George W. Bush , both in
cowboy hats, appeared on screen. “That’s all I did for eight
years,” Stewart said.  The embassy’s Twitter post rankled sensitivities in  Egypt 
as the country resumed talks yesterday with the  International
Monetary Fund  for a $4.8 billion loan. Stewart’s charge that
Mursi is stifling free speech echoed concerns expressed by U.S.
Secretary of State  John Kerry  and other administration officials
about speech restrictions, arrests, and treatment of minorities
in Egypt.  “The embassy is now reviewing its procedures,” State
Department spokeswoman  Victoria Nuland  said yesterday about the
Cairo embassy’s Twitter account.  Individual embassies and consulates are responsible for
their own Twitter feeds “and they are expected to use good
policy judgment in doing that,” she said.  Egypt’s Stewart  Youssef, who’s known as Egypt’s Jon Stewart, has been
released on bail. Mursi’s presidential office said on its
Facebook page yesterday that “all citizens are free to express
themselves without the restrictions that prevailed” under
longtime leader  Hosni Mubarak , who was ousted in the 2011
popular uprising.  Nuland said on April 1 that Youssef’s arrest and
questioning on charges of insulting Islam and Mursi, along with
warrants issued for political activists, “is evidence of a
disturbing trend of growing restrictions on the freedom of
expression.”  She also spoke of U.S. concern that Egypt is slow in
investigating attacks on protesters outside the presidential
palace or cases of police brutality.  Kerry, who traveled to Cairo in March to urge Mursi to take
steps to revive the economy, said April 2 that the Obama
administration has “real concerns about the direction that
Egypt appears to be moving in.”  ‘Blatant Interference’  The ruling Islamist party that Mursi once belonged to, the
Muslim Brotherhood, called Nuland’s remarks “blatant
interference.” Yesterday, the spokeswoman said the U.S.
administration backs the comments that she and Kerry made.  The Muslim Brotherhood’s political wing, the Freedom and
Justice Party, said April 2 on its Twitter feed that it had been
“inappropriate for a diplomatic mission to engage in such
negative political propaganda.”  Stewart showed clips of Youssef appearing as a guest on his
Comedy Central show and said, “I know Bassem. Bassem is my
brother.”  The 50-year-old comedian addressed Mursi directly. “When
you are actually powerful, you don’t have to be petty,” Stewart
said. “I know. I’m petty all the time.”  Stewart showed a clip of comments by Mursi in a January
2012 interview with  CNN , when the Egyptian leader said that
“whoever criticizes me has the full right to do so.”  Asked specifically about Youssef, among other critics,
Mursi said “there is no way harm can befall them because of
their opinions or their personal opposition.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
