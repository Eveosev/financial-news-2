Andy Pettitte  allowed one run in
eight innings and the  New York Yankees  won for the first time in
2013, defeating the visiting Boston Red Sox 4-2 to avoid a sweep
of their season-opening three-game Major League Baseball series.  Brett Gardner  and  Francisco Cervelli  hit solo home runs
last night for the Yankees. Mariano Rivera, who missed most of
2012 after tearing a knee ligament, got his MLB record-extending
609th save despite allowing a ninth-inning run.  The New York Mets were held to five hits in a 2-1 at Citi
Field to the San Diego Padres, the hosts’ first defeat of the
season. Mets starter Dillon Gee allowed one run on three hits
over 6 1/3 innings. All three New York starting pitchers this
season have gone into the seventh inning and allowed two or
fewer runs.  Also in the National League yesterday, the Washington
Nationals improved to 3-0 with a 6-1 victory against the
visiting Miami Marlins;  Cliff Lee  held the host Atlanta Braves
to two hits in eight scoreless innings of the Philadelphia
Phillies’ 2-0 victory, and the Chicago Cubs won 3-2 at the
Pittsburgh Pirates.  J.P. Arencibia hit two of Toronto’s five homers in the Blue
Jays’ 10-8 win at home against the Cleveland Indians. In other
American League games, it was Oakland 8, Seattle 2; Baltimore 6,
Tampa Bay 3; Kansas City 3, the Chicago White Sox 1, and
Minnesota 8, Detroit 2.  The Cincinnati Reds defeated the Los Angeles Angels 5-4 in
an interleague game.  To contact the reporters on this story:
