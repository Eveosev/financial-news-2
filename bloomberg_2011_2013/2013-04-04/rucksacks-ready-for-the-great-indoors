Some backpacks are a lot like SUVs: they're made for extremes their owners will never, ever endure. Leave it to the Japanese to take this paradox and milk it: hand-made, haute-couture bags where every detail is scrutinized beyond what seems reasonable. They're so expensive you'd arguably be nuts to take them outside.  Master-piece bags, based in Osaka, is a prime example of this "high- performance, higher cost" phenomenon. For approximately $250 you can buy a " Buddy " skateboard backpack--the glistening leather and nylon front straps are there for the improbable occasion the wearer actually owns a skateboard.  And if $680 sounds like a reasonable amount of money to spend on a pack, you're also in luck: Master- piece's " Navy Potential Multi- Way Bag ," made from waterproof nylon, leather, and suede trim, should fit the (pre tax) bill.  White Mountaineering, the Tokyo- based fashion line specializing in utility and technology, has a signature  water-repellent canvas and suede backpack . The pack, which boasts a reinforced base, is marketed for "everyday use" and retails for approximately $440.  And then there's  Undercover , the fashion line designed by Jun Takahashi. Undercover's bags are admittedly less concerned with performance and more focused exclusively on fashion. That said, the " Men's Patch Backpack ," retailing at an eye-watering $1,030, makes a nod to durability with "hard-wearing" nylon. The brand's logo, a hand giving the middle finger, is pleasantly ambiguous about the recipient: the person walking behind you or the one schlepping a thousand-dollar napsack.
