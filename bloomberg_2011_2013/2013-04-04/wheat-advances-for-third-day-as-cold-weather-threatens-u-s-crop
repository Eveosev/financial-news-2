Wheat climbed for a third day as
freezing conditions in the U.S. raised the risk of more damage
to the winter crop, while cold soil temperatures may delay
spring planting. Corn increased and soybeans declined.  The May contract for wheat strengthened as much as 1.3
percent to $7.055 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade and was
at $6.98 at 10:14 a.m. Singapore time on volume that was more
than double the 100-day average for that time of day.  Soil temperatures in parts of the U.S. Plains fell to as
low as 28 degrees Fahrenheit, well below the 37 degrees needed
to start planting,  Bryce Anderson , an agricultural meteorologist
at DTN, said in an interview from Omaha,  Nebraska  today. Winter-
wheat crop  conditions  improved little since November, when they
were the worst since government record-keeping began in 1985,
the government said April 1.  “Contributing to the technical price recovery is the
cooler-than-normal weather across much of the northern
hemisphere, which is slowing crop development,”  Luke Mathews , a
commodity strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia  wrote in
a report today. “Cold weather is seen delaying spring wheat
planting in the U.S. Northern Plains, and concern lingers as to
the extent of damage caused by frost in the U.S. Southern Plains
last week.”  The total wheat harvest, including winter and spring
varieties, will probably drop to 2.1 billion bushels in the year
beginning June from 2.269 billion a year earlier, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  predicted Feb. 22. Corn for May
delivery rose 0.2 percent to $6.425 a bushel in Chicago, while
soybeans fell 0.3 percent to $13.7675 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
