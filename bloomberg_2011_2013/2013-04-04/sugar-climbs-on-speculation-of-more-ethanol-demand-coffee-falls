Sugar rose for the first time in
three days in New York on speculation more of the new cane
harvest in  Brazil , the world’s largest producer, will be used
for ethanol. Coffee declined.  Sugar waiting to be loaded at ports in Brazil was 817,977
metric tons, according to figures e-mailed yesterday from
Williams Servicos Maritimos Ltda. The line-up was 1.04 million
tons a week earlier. Brazil’s cane harvest, used to make ethanol
and sugar, usually starts in April, boosting supplies.  “This means that maybe more cane is being used for ethanol
and that there may be less raws available in May,” said Keith
Flury, an analyst at Rabobank International in  London , by e-mail
today. “At this time you might expect the line-up to keep
growing.”  Raw sugar for May delivery jumped 0.7 percent to 17.62
cents a pound by 8:48 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .
Prices have dropped 9.7 percent this year with Brazil forecast
by Sucres et Denrees SA to have a record cane crop.  Arabica coffee fell 1.1 percent to $1.3795 a pound in New
York and robusta beans dropped 0.8 percent to $2,066 a pound in
London.  Cocoa declined 1 percent to $2,128 a ton in New York and
fell 1.1 percent in London to 1,448 pounds ($2,190) a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
