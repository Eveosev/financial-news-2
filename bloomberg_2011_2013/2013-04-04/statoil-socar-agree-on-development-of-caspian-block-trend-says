State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, or
Socar, and  Statoil ASA (STL)  will sign a contract for the joint
development of the Zafar-Mashal block in Azerbaijan’s section of
the Caspian Sea on April 8, Trend said today, citing an
unidentified person.  The news service based in Baku, the Azeri capital, gave no
details on the terms of the agreement.  Zafar-Mashal, a deepwater block located about 75 miles (110
kilometers) southeast of Baku, is estimated by Socar to contain
300 billion cubic meters of natural gas and 37 million metric
tons of condensate, or light oil, Trend said.  Socar signed a production-sharing agreement with  Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and  ConocoPhillips (COP)  for Zafar-Mashal in 1999, though
the project was abandoned after the partners didn’t find
commercial quantities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
