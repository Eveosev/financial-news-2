Carmelo Anthony scored 40 points to
lead the  New York  Knicks to their 10th straight win, a 95-82
victory at the Atlanta Hawks that gave the Knicks their longest
winning streak since 1994.  Anthony hit 17 of 27 shots for 40 points, one night after
matching his career high with 50 points at the Miami Heat. He
became the first Knicks player to score at least 40 points in
consecutive games since Patrick Ewing in the 1989-90 season.  J.R. Smith came off the bench to score 19 points and
Raymond Felton added 14 for the Knicks at Atlanta’s Philips
Arena. Kyle Korver led the Hawks with 25 points and Jeff Teague
added 15.  “Every game is important now,” Knicks coach Mike Woodson
told reporters last night.  The Knicks (48-26) are atop the Eastern Conference’s five-
team Atlantic Division, five games ahead of the Brooklyn Nets
(43-31), who defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 113-95 last night.  In the Eastern Conference race for second seed behind the
Miami Heat (58-16), the Knicks are a half-game ahead of the
Indiana Pacers (48-27).  To contact the reporter on this story:
