The U.S.  Internal Revenue Service  is
increasing the production tax credit available this year for
energy generated by wind, geothermal, solar and closed-
loop biomass because of inflation.  The credit will increase to 2.3 cents a kilowatt-hour from
2.2 cents, according to a notice in the Federal Register
yesterday. The subsidy applies to the 2013 calendar year,
according to the IRS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
