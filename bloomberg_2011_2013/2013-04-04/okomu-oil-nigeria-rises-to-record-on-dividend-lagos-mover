Okomu Oil Palm Plc (OKOMUOIL)  of Nigeria rose
to the highest on record after it announced a plan to pay
dividends and bonuses to shareholders, according to Lambeth
Trust & Investment Co.  The shares gained for an eight day, rising the maximum
daily limit of 10 percent to 96.49 naira by the close in Lagos,
Nigeria’s commercial capital, the highest since at least
February 2002 when Bloomberg began compiling the data. About 7.2
million shares were traded, or more than 16 times the three-
month daily average.  “The company notified brokers yesterday of its intention
to pay a dividend of 7 naira per share and issue 1 for 1 bonus
for last year,” David Adonri, chief executive officer of Lagos-
based Lambeth, said by phone today. “Investors are buying its
shares to partake in the impressive distribution.”  An e-mail sent to the company’s secretary wasn’t
immediately returned. Okomu is yet to release its full-year
results. It plans to double output of palm oil to 60 tons an
hour from 2013, Chairman Gbenga Oyebode said in December.  The company’s shares have more than doubled this year,
compared with a 22 percent rise in the Nigerian Stock Exchange’s
 All-Share Index. (NGSEINDX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
