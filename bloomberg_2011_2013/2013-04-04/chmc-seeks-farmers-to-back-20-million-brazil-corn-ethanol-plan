China National Heavy Machinery
Corp., the Beijing-based developer of industrial facilities and
warehouses, is asking Brazilian farmers to invest 40 million
reais ($20 million) in a corn-ethanol plant that will help
diversify their revenue.  CHMC, as the company is known, is seeking to start
construction next year in Nova Mutum, in Mato Grosso state,
Romario Limberger Jr., the city’s secretary of industry,
commerce and tourism, said in a telephone interview today.  While virtually all of  Brazil ’s ethanol is made from sugar
cane, some farmers of grains want to produce the renewable fuel
to reduce their exposure to volatile commodity markets,
Limberger said.  “They won’t be so vulnerable to variations in the
market,” he said. Farmers “want to add value to their
products.”  The proposed plant will process 400 tons of corn a day, he
said. CHMC didn’t reply to phone and e-mail messages after the
close of regular business hours today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
