Bank of Japan (8301)  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will probably be reconfirmed by parliament for a full
five-year term tomorrow, after the bank said it will double
monthly government bond purchases in a bid to defeat deflation.  Kuroda became central bank chief in March, serving the
remaining three weeks of outgoing Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa ’s
term, and parliament will vote tomorrow for a full term
beginning April 9. Yoshimi Watanabe, whose Your Party opposed
Kuroda last month, today said he now supports him, virtually
guaranteeing confirmation.  The BOJ’s policy board today voted to increase bond
purchases to 7 trillion yen ($74 billion) per month, while
dropping a limit on the maturities of debt it buys. The first
announcement under Kuroda sent the yen down the most against the
dollar since October 2011, boosted stocks and sent 10-year bond
yields to their lowest on record.  Economy Minister Akira Amari told reporters that the
central bank had changed greatly under Kuroda and was falling in
line with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s policies to end 15 years
of falling prices.  The lower house of parliament will vote around 12:15 p.m.
and the upper house is scheduled to vote around 12:30 p.m.  To contact the reporters on this story:
