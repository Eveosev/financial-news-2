Residential Capital LLC must prove
that proposed bonuses valued at $7.8 million are appropriate
given that some of the money would be paid to the bankrupt
mortgage company’s insiders, an arm of the U.S. government said.  The proposed payments would go to 163 individuals, with two
insiders getting 14 percent of the total and six others
receiving another 32 percent, the U.S. Trustee, a bankruptcy
watchdog for the  Justice Department , said in papers filed
yesterday in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Manhattan. The bonuses
require court approval.  ResCap has failed to prove that the bonuses “are not
‘virtually guaranteed’ and mere ‘lay-ups’ and that the present
targets are difficult to achieve, forcing the insiders to
‘stretch’ in order to earn their bonuses,” lawyers for the U.S.
Trustee wrote.  A 2005 bankruptcy law states that companies in Chapter 11
shouldn’t be able to pay so-called retention bonuses over a
certain amount just to keep an executive unless there is proof
that the individual has a legitimate outside job offer.  ResCap, based in  New York , filed for bankruptcy in May with
plans to sell most of its assets and resolve legal claims
related to residential mortgage-backed securities. The company
is owned by Detroit-based auto lender  Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY)   The case is In re Residential Capital LLC, 12-12020, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
