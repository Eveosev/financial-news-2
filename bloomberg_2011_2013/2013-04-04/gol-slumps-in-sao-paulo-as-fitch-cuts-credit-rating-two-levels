Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4) ,
 Brazil ’s second-biggest air carrier by market share, fell as
 Fitch Ratings  cut its credit ranking by two levels, citing a
“continued deterioration” in the company’s credit profile.  Shares dropped 3.6 percent to 10.86 reais at the close of
trading in  Sao Paulo , the lowest since Dec. 17. The benchmark
 Bovespa index  declined 1.6 percent. Gol’s dollar bonds due in
2020 fell 6 cents to 88 cents on the dollar, pushing the yield
up 136 basis points to 11.75 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Fitch lowered Gol’s rating to B-, or six levels below
investment grade, with a negative outlook, and said the cut
reflects “poor operational results and the expectation of
limited recovery in the company’s  cash flow  generation during
2013,” according to an e-mailed report yesterday.  Gol’s margin on earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation, amortization and rent fell to 3.2 percent in 2012
from 9 percent in 2011 and 22 percent in 2010, according to
Fitch. The lower margins reflect increasing competition, rising
fuel costs and a weakening Brazilian real, the ratings company
said in the statement.  “The downgrade is reason for concern, because it will make
it much more expensive for Gol to finance operations,” Marcelo Varejao, an analyst at brokerage Socopa, said by phone from Sao
Paulo. “The air carrier now has to harden its restructuring
plan in order to improve its financial situation.”  In 2012, Sao Paulo-based Gol cut flights and fired workers
to improve profitability. The company’s net income has trailed
analysts’ estimates in the past four quarters.  Standard & Poor’s  placed the Brazilian airline’s rating on
negative watch on March 28, citing “weaker operating
performance and negative cash flow in the fourth quarter of
2012.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
