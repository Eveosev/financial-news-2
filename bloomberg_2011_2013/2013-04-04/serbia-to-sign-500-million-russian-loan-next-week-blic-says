Serbia has accepted  Russia â€™s offer
for a $500 million loan to support the budget, Belgrade
newspaper Blic reported, citing Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic.  The 10-year loan, with a two-year grace period, carries a
fixed interest rate of 3.5 percent, Dinkic said, adding that
Serbia has no plans to issue a new Eurobond any time soon. The
loan agreement will be signed next week in Moscow, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
