Residual-fuel inventories in
Singapore,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center, fell
4.4 percent to the lowest level in more than seven months,
according to a unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy
residue and excluding bitumen decreased 748,000 barrels to 16.3
million in the seven days to yesterday,  International Enterprise
Singapore  said today in an e-mailed statement. That’s the fifth
weekly decline, bringing supplies to the lowest since the week
ended Aug. 22.  Stockpiles of  middle distillates  including gasoil, or
diesel, and kerosene increased 32,000 barrels, or 0.3 percent,
to 10.1 million barrels, the ministry’s data showed. That’s the
third gain in four weeks.  Light-distillate inventories including naphtha, gasoline
and reformate rebounded 728,000 barrels, or 6.8 percent, to 11.4
million barrels, according to the data. Stockpiles climbed to
the highest since Jan. 9.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
