Rubber dropped the most in two weeks
as the Japanese currency strengthened to near a one-month high,
cutting the appetite for yen-based commodities.  The contract for delivery in September slumped as much as
3.5 percent to 252.5 yen a kilogram ($2,716 a metric ton), the
lowest since Nov. 19 for a most-active contract on the  Tokyo 
Commodity Exchange, and was at 252.8 yen at 11:12 a.m. Futures
have fallen 16 percent this year and passed the threshold into a
 bear market  on April 1.  The yen advanced amid speculation that additional easing
measures from today’s Bank of Japan meeting have already been
priced in by investors. ADP Research Institute data showed U.S.
companies boosted employment by 158,000 workers in March, less
than the median forecast of 39 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
who called for a 200,000 gain.  “The sell-off today is caused by the strong yen and lower-
than-expected U.S. payroll data,” said Naohiro Niimura, a
partner at research company Market Risk Advisory Co. in Tokyo.  Investors also reduced their positions in rubber amid
holidays in China starting today and heightened tensions on the
Korean peninsular, said Hiroyuki Kikukawa, general manager for
research at Nihon Unicom Inc.  BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda concludes his first policy
meeting today after pledging to step up easing to defeat
deflation and spur growth.  Output among the world’s top producers, representing 93
percent of global supplies, increased 3.1 percent to 10.6
million tons in 2012, according to the Association of Natural
Rubber Producing Countries. That compared with growth of 8.6
percent a year earlier, it said.  China, Thailand  The contract for September delivery fell 1.1 percent to
close at 21,340  yuan  ($3,444) a ton on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange yesterday. Stockpiles monitored by the bourse fell for
the first time in nine weeks by 192 tons to 117,504 tons, down
from the highest in three years last week, it said yesterday.  Thai rubber free-on-board was unchanged at 83.75 baht
