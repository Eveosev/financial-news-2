SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. (SNC) , the Canadian
engineering company recovering from a corruption scandal, gave
Chief Executive Officer Robert Card compensation of C$6.4
million ($6.3 million) for his first three months on the job.  Card, 60, was granted C$5.9 million in stock after he began
Oct. 1, the Montreal-based company said today in a filing. He
also received C$225,000 in salary, C$41,500 in pension payments
and C$56,258 in other benefits, the company said.  Card, the first American-born head in SNC’s 102-year
history, was hired amid an investigation that led to fraud
charges against former CEO Pierre Duhaime and lawsuits from
investors. Ensuring the company kept its “social license to
operate” was among the top priorities for Card, who has
appointed senior managers and is considering the sale of
infrastructure assets from a toll road to  power lines  after
grouping them in a new unit.  Vice Chairman Ian Bourne will take over as chairman May 2
when Gwyn Morgan retires, SNC said today in a separate
statement. Three other directors will retire and be replaced by
Jacques Bougie, the former CEO of aluminum maker Alcan Inc.;
Lise Lachapelle, the former CEO of the Forest Products
Association of Canada; and Alain Rheaume, the former president
of Canadian wireless operator Microcell Telecommunications Inc.  Duhaime was paid a base salary of C$256,045 until his
departure in March 2012. SNC’s board suspended severance
payments of about C$5 million to the former CEO in December
“until the facts surrounding Mr. Duhaime’s situation are
clarified or resolved,” the company said today in the filing.  SNC  fell  0.1 percent C$41.95 at 10:28 a.m. in Toronto.
Through yesterday, SNC had gained 11 percent since Sept. 28, the
last trading day before Card took over.  To contact the reporter on this story:
