Mytrah Energy Ltd. (MYT)  is studying a
listing of its wind assets in  Singapore  as the Indian developer
seeks to pay debt and expand.  Mytrah, whose investors including Henderson Global
Investors Ltd. and R&H Trust Co Ltd., may list the assets as a
business trust on Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Ltd.,
the Hyderabad-based company said today in a statement.  The move will help Mytrah reduce its cost of capital from
the 12 percent it currently pays on senior debt and the higher
rates it pays on mezzanine loans, Gus Hochschild, a London-based
analyst at Mirabaud Securities LLP, said today in an e-mailed
note. Other Indian Singapore-listed business trusts pay less
than 10 percent, according to Hochschild.  “By such means, Mytrah should realize a much higher value
of the existing assets than the market ascribes,” he said.  The business trust would acquire Mytrah’s wind assets as
part of the listing, with the developer keeping a stake in the
vehicle. In addition to repaying long-term and mezzanine debt,
Mytrah will use proceeds to boost its 309.9 megawatts of
operational wind to more than 600 megawatts this year, with
plans for more than 1,200 megawatts by the end of 2014. The
company targets 1,500 megawatts by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
