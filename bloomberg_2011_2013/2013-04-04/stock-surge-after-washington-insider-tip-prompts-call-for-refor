Senator Charles E. Grassley said he
will investigate how an investor services firm specializing in
so-called political intelligence got early word of a Medicare-rate decision that led to a surge in health insurer stocks.  At issue is a private e-mail from the  Washington  research
firm Height Analytics LLC to its  Wall Street  clients that
Medicare rates, scheduled to drop under a preliminary decision,
would increase instead. The e-mail hit at 3:40 p.m. on April 1,
followed by a sharp rise in the stocks of insurers such as
 Humana Inc. (HUM)  that participate in the Medicare program.  Grassley, an  Iowa  Republican and his party’s top member on
the Judiciary Committee, yesterday wrote the head of the U.S.
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services demanding the
timeline of a decision to reverse a planned cut to rates
Medicare pays insurance companies. While it’s not clear where
the information to Height Analytics came from, the letter asked
the agency about anybody who might have been told of the news
early, including the administration and members of Congress.  “This raises questions regarding political intelligence
brokers’ ability to gather information from CMS in order to
predict market moving events,” Grassley said in the letter.
Past inquiries to Medicare have found the agency had “loose
procedures for dealing with outside firms,” Grassley said in
the letter.  April 9 Response  He asked for a response by April 9, when  Marilyn Tavenner ,
acting administrator of the agency, is expected to appear before
the Senate Finance Committee for a hearing on her nomination to
head the agency permanently. The committee announced her
confirmation hearing on April 2, a day after Medicare announced
its rate decision.  The disclosure of the planned rate reversal by Height
Analytics to clients sent shares of Humana and other insurers up
as much as 9.5 percent on April 1, 40 minutes before the U.S.
agency was able to make its own official announcement after the
market closed. Medicare typically releases information after the
market closes to prevent such stock swings.  One of Height’s founders is Andrew Parmentier, a former
staffer for the House Financial Services Committee and
previously an aide to former House Majority Leader  Dick Armey .  “Does the political intelligence industry have advance
knowledge of internal agency decision-making?” Grassley, a
Republican from Iowa, asked in a statement yesterday. “Did that
come from the agency, Congress, or the White House? And if so,
that’s unfair to everyday investors.”  Stock Mixed  Shares of health insurers in Medicare Advantage were mixed
today. UnitedHealth Group Inc., of Minnetonka,  Minnesota , rose
less than 1 percent to  $62.10 (UNH)  at the close in New York. Humana,
based in Louisville,  Kentucky , fell 1.7 percent to $78.27 and
Indianapolis-based  WellPoint Inc. (WLP)  declined less than 1 percent
to $67.99.  The incident has drawn scrutiny on the world of political
intelligence firms, which sell investor clients information
about what action government agencies or legislators are likely
to take. Grassley has proposed having firms like Height register
their employees, much as lobbyists have to do now.  “We have a right to know who’s in the business of
political information, intelligence gathering,” Grassley said
in an interview with Bloomberg TV yesterday. “We need to know
that the same way we have a right to know who lobbies
Congress.”  Height Response  In an e-mail response to questions, Parmentier wrote: “We
are confident our April 1 report was based on good research,
conducted in accordance with the laws, rules and regulations
governing the securities industry.”  After the Height memo was sent out, about 4 million shares
for Louisville, Kentucky-based Humana changed hands in the last
20 minutes of trading on April 1, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s equivalent to $305 million in market value and
compares with a daily average volume of 2.17 million shares over
the past year.  The timing of the memo, as well as the plausibility that
the government might reverse itself, is what caused the markets
to swing the way they did, said  Jeff Jonas , an analyst with
Gabelli & Co. in New York who said he doesn’t subscribe to
Height’s notes.  “We know this administration wanted to make health reform
work and didn’t want to cause massive disruption in the
market,” Jonas said in a telephone interview. “There was also
a case of pretty unprecedented lobbying by the House and Senate.
That’s why the impact was probably a lot greater than normal.”  Significance Growing  Given the potential stock swings, firms like Height are
growing in Washington, as is the whole industry of expert advice
and intelligence, said Les Funtleyder, president of the
investment advisory division at New York-based Poliwogg LLC  “Results like this tend to build credibility,” Funtleyder
said in a telephone interview. “You make a call like this, and
people start to pay attention. You make a couple of good calls,
and if you can deliver a product that enables people to make
money, people will flock to you.”  It may be hard for the government to stop the flow of
information from Washington to Wall Street. The Government
Accountability Office, a nonpartisan arm of government that
serves as the investigative arm of Congress, released a  report 
yesterday on political intelligence firms that said it was
difficult to find out exactly how deep the firms had penetrated.  “The prevalence of the sale of political intelligence is
not known and therefore difficult to quantify,” the agency said
in the report. “Even when a connection can be established
between discrete pieces of government information and investment
decisions, it is not always clear whether such information could
be definitively categorized as material.”  ‘Two Standards’  There’s little question, though, that the information can
offer an advantage, said  Erik Gordon , a professor at the Ross
School of Business at the  University of Michigan  in  Ann Arbor .  “We have two standards here -- we have a standard for
inside information coming from business corporations, and no
standard for it coming from the federal government,” Gordon
said. “The standard for the federal government should be
higher, instead of non-existent.”  The Height memo outlined the firm’s belief “that a deal
has been hatched to protect Medicare Advantage rates,”
according to the copy received by  Bloomberg News .  The note suggested the deal may be aimed to “smooth the
confirmation” of Tavenner, who President  Barack Obama  has
chosen to head the CMS.  Key Rate  The announcement by the CMS said a key rate used to
determine payments insurers get for running the government’s
Medicare Advantage plans would be boosted by 3.3 percent,
instead of trimmed by 2.2 percent. The about-face by the
Medicare agency came after insurers and Republican lawmakers
complained that the Obama administration relied on faulty
accounting assumptions in proposing the cut.  Height describes itself as a “privately-held capital
markets firm that provides research, advisory and investment
banking services,” according to its website.  Humana gained about 1.8 percent on April 1 before jumping
as much as 9.5 percent after 3:40 p.m. and closing up 8.6
percent before the announcement. Humana gets 66 percent of its
revenue and 58 percent of profit from Medicare Advantage,
leading the industry, according to estimates by Cowen & Co.
analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
