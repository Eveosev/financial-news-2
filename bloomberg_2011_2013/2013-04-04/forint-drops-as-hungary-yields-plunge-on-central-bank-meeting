The forint slid for a second day and
 Hungary ’s 10-year bond yields fell to a three-month low as the
central bank prepared to unveil measures to boost the economy.  Hungary’s currency depreciated after the Magyar Nemzeti
Bank announced yesterday that President Gyorgy Matolcsy will
hold a briefing at 11 a.m. in Budapest today. The press office
didn’t specify the topic, saying it will be followed by
presentations from central bank staff on “options to boost
lending.” Policy makers may copy tools used by the  European
Central Bank , the Magyar Nemzet newspaper reported, without
saying where it got the information. The measures may include
cheap loans for commercial banks, news website Origo said, also
without citing anyone.  “The extraordinary measures will be unlikely to strengthen
the forint,” Levente Blaho and Adam Keszeg, Budapest-based
analysts at  Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) , wrote in a
research report today. “It would have been better not to give
the impression that the bank is in such a hurry to act.”  The forint dropped 0.2 percent to 303.06 per euro by 9:34
a.m. in Budapest. Yields on the government’s benchmark 10-year
bonds fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.09
percent, the lowest since Jan. 3.  The currency has gained 1 percent since policy makers urged
caution in monetary easing when they cut the benchmark rate by
25 basis points to a record low 5 percent on March 26, in the
first meeting headed by Matolcsy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
