U.S. stock futures pared gains as
government data showed more Americans than projected filed
applications for  unemployment benefits  last week.  S&P 500 futures expiring in June gained 0.2 percent to
1,551.8 at 8:34 a.m. in New York, paring an earlier advance of
as much as 0.5 percent.  Jobless claims rose by 28,000 to 385,000 in the week ended
March 30, the highest since Nov. 24, Labor Department figures
showed today in Washington. The median forecast of 47 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for a drop to 353,000. Before
adjusting for seasonal variations, claims fell by almost 1,600.  The Easter holiday falls on different weeks from year to
year, making it more difficult for the government to adjust the
data, a Labor Department spokesman said as the numbers were
released.  The  S&P 500  slid 1.1 percent yesterday, the most in more
than a month, on worse-than-estimated economic data. A report
from ADP Research Institute showed companies boosted employment
by 158,000 workers in March, below economists’ forecasts calling
for a 200,000 gain.  The jobs data come before tomorrow’s non-farm payrolls
report from the Labor Department, which may show employers hired
a net 195,000 workers for the month, according to the median
forecast of 87 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  U.S. equity futures climbed earlier today as the  Bank of
Japan  doubled its bond purchases to help drive the world’s
third-largest economy. European Central Bank officials meeting
in Frankfurt left interest rates on hold as policy makers weigh
their options to increase stimulus. The  Bank of England  kept its
interest rate unchanged at 0.5 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
