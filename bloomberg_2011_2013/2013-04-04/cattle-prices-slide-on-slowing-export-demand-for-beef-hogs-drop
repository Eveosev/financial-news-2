Cattle futures fell for the third
time this week on signs of weak demand for U.S. beef. Hog prices
also declined.  Export sales of beef totaled 10,508 metric tons (23.2
million pounds) in the week ended March 28, down 39 percent from
a week earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture data showed
today. Wholesale-beef  prices  were little changed at $1.9148 a
pound yesterday.  “You’re going to have trouble sustaining any upward
movement in beef prices,” with exports and domestic demand
“being at lower levels, especially for the better cuts,”  Dick Quiter, an account executive at McFarland Commodities LLC in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “It’s just a tough time
for the meats here in general.”  Cattle futures for June delivery dropped 0.2 percent to
$1.229 a pound at 11:02 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
The price was down 0.9 percent this week through yesterday.  Feeder-cattle futures for May settlement slid less than 0.1
percent to $1.465 a pound.  Hog futures for June settlement dropped 0.3 percent to 92.2
cents a pound. The commodity climbed 7.9 percent this year
through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
