Ethanol strengthened against
gasoline a day after a U.S. Energy Information Administration
reported record low inventory for this time of year.  The spread tightened 2.63 cents to 47.57 cents a gallon as
the Energy Department’s analytical arm said  stockpiles  of the
fuel last week rose 0.2 percent to 17.5 million barrels, from
the lowest level since the week ended Dec. 9, 2011. Inventories
are 22 percent lower than a year ago.  “There’s a lot of demand in the front for prompt
product,” said Jim Damask, a manager at StarFuels Inc. in
Jupiter,  Florida . “They must be ripping right through supply.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery rose 1.1 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $2.423 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Gasoline futures for May delivery dropped 1.53 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $2.8987 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol companies have tempered  production  7.6 percent to
807,000 barrels a day from a year earlier, before the worst
drought since the 1930s sent corn prices to a record high and
eroded returns for making the fuel.  Corn prices plunged 14 percent after a March 28 Agriculture
Department report showed domestic inventories on March 1 totaled
5.399 billion bushels, exceeding analysts’ estimates of 4.995
billion.  Corn Prices  Corn for May delivery fell 11.5 cents, or 1.8 percent, to
$6.30 a bushel in Chicago, the lowest settlement since June.  The corn crush spread, representing gains or losses from
turning corn into ethanol and based on May contracts, was 13
cents a gallon, up from 8 cents yesterday. The amount doesn’t
include revenue from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a
byproduct of ethanol production, which can be fed to livestock.  Under a 2007 energy law, known as the Renewable Fuels
Standard, the U.S. is required to use 13.8 billion gallons of
ethanol this year and 14.4 billion in 2014.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 92 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool, the least since Feb. 22, the EIA said.
That’s down from a record 95 percent in the week ended March 15.  Imports of the fuel averaged 49,000 barrels a day last
week, the highest level since Jan. 18 and up from 9,000 barrels
a year earlier, EIA said.  Spot Trading  In cash market trading, ethanol jumped 8 cents to $2.48 a
gallon in  Chicago , 7 cents to $2.535 in the Gulf and 4 cents to
$2.59 in  New York , data compiled by Bloomberg show. Prices
slipped 0.5 cent to $2.675 on the West Coast, the most expensive
U.S. hub.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the U.S. Gulf narrowed 35
percent to 14 cents, the least since March 6, while Chicago’s
discount to New York Harbor shrank 27 percent to 11 cents.  Biofuel in the U.S. is tracked by Renewable Identification
Numbers, or RINs, certificates that refiners use to show
compliance with mandates to the Environmental Protection Agency
or trade to other parties.  Corn-based ethanol RINs  rose 1.4 percent to 71 cents today,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. They traded at 7.1 cents on
Jan. 7.  Advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel and Brazilian
sugarcane-based ethanol, added 2 percent to 78 cents. Those
certificates traded at 37 cents on Jan. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
