The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
increased, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  rose 2 basis points to 122 as of 8:28
a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices show.
The benchmark has ranged from 100.5 to 122.3 since Dec. 31,
according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index increased 1.5 basis points to
111 as of 9:28 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Deutsche Bank AG
prices. The gauge fell 46 basis points in the three months ended
March 31, its second consecutive quarter of declines, CMA data
show.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index climbed 1.5 basis points
to 120 as of 10:45 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking Corp. prices
show. The measure has ranged from 102.3 basis points to 127.5
this year, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
