San Bernardino will resume paying
into the  California Public Employees’ Retirement System  in July,
ending an almost yearlong hiatus that began when it entered
bankruptcy last August, according to a spokeswoman for the fund.  The city’s  obligation  to the largest U.S. pension, known as
Calpers, is $25.5 million for fiscal 2013, which ends June 30,
according to fund data. While that’s just 0.3 percent of all
employer contributions to the  system , fund and  city  documents
show it’s about 21 percent of San Bernardino’s revenue.  San Bernardino has told Calpers that its payments will
resume with the start of fiscal 2014 on July 1, said Amy Norris,
a fund spokeswoman. Officials in the city of 213,000 haven’t
indicated how they will come up with the $10.2 million already
owed, she said by e-mail. The stopped payments raised concerns
at the retirement system, which objected to the bankruptcy.  City Manager Allen Parker and  Jim Morris , Mayor Patrick Morris’s son and chief of staff, didn’t immediately respond to
telephone messages requesting comment on the payment resumption.  Stockton, California, the largest U.S. city to enter
 bankruptcy protection , continued to make payments to Calpers.
The $256.6 billion fund has more than 1.6 million members and
provides benefits to about 551,600 retirees.  Calpers formally objected to San Bernardino’s bankruptcy
filing, arguing that city officials made “irresponsible and
short-sighted” decisions that led to the fiscal predicament.  The bankruptcy case is In re San Bernardino, 12-28006,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Central District of California (Riverside).  To contact the reporter on this story:
