Zynga Inc. (ZNGA)  Chief Executive Officer
Mark Pincus lowered his salary to $1 and opted not to receive a
cash bonus or equity award in 2013 as the largest social-game
maker seeks to trim costs.  The salary change took effect April 1, according to a
filing today by the San Francisco-based company. In 2011, Pincus
was paid $1.68 million, including a salary of $300,000 and a
bonus of $3,750, filings show. Zynga hasn’t disclosed executive
salaries for 2012.  Pincus, who founded Zynga in 2007, is cutting costs
including his own salary as the game maker struggles to keep up
with consumers shifting to mobile-based games. In October, the
CEO said he was making “tough decisions” such as eliminating 5
percent of jobs, shutting offices and ending development on more
than a dozen game titles.  The other top six executives at Zynga are each expected to
take home more about $2 million or more apiece in salary and
performance awards, according to the filing. Cadir Lee,
executive vice president and chief technology officer, will make
$500,000 in salary and be eligible for a bonus of $500,000 as
well as a performance target of as much as $1.77 million this
year.  Pincus’ net worth is about $800 million, according to
 Bloomberg Billionaires Index . He was one of the earliest
investors in  Facebook Inc. (FB) , whose stock still accounts for more
than $100 million of his holdings.  Zynga declined 2.3 percent to $3.45 at the close in New
York, leaving the shares down 66 percent since the company’s
December 2011 initial public offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
