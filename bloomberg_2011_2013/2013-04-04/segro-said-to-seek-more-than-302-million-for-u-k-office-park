Segro Plc (SGRO) , the U.K.’s largest
publicly traded owner of industrial properties, is seeking to
sell an office park with tenants including  Intel Corp. (INTC)  and
 Virgin Media Inc. (VMED)  for more than 200 million pounds ($302
million), two people with knowledge of the matter said.  Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. has been hired to manage the sale
of IQ Winnersh on the outskirts of Reading, England, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the plan is
private. Segro intends to use the proceeds to buy logistics
properties around major ports and airports in Europe, one of the
people said. Eleanor Johnson, a spokeswoman for London-based
Segro, declined to comment.  Segro in January said it had raised 700 million pounds from
property sales since announcing a plan in November 2011 to
divest 1.6 billion pounds of real estate to help repay debt and
focus on more profitable properties. The company said it expects
to sell 300 million pounds to 500 million pounds of properties
this year.  Segro’s real estate lost about 180 million pounds of its
value in the second half of last year, the company said, citing
weaker markets in the U.K. and mainland Europe. Offices in
southeast England accounted for 75 million pounds of the
decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
