Aabar Investments PJSC, a unit of
 Abu Dhabi ’s International Petroleum Investment Co., signed a
$2.5 billion loan with 12 banks to refinance a deal maturing
next month, according to two people with knowledge of the
matter.  The facility comprises three- and five-year term portions,
each with slices denominated in dirhams, dollars and euros, said
the people, who asked not to be identified because the terms are
private. The financing was increased from $2 billion originally
targeted after lenders offered more funds than were sought, the
people said.  Arab Bank Plc., Bank of America Corp., BNP Paribas SA,
Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
Morgan Stanley,  National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC (NBAD) , Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc, Societe Generale SA, UniCredit SpA and Union
National Bank PJSC participated in the facility, the people
said.  The loan replaces a $2 billion loan obtained in 2010 that
comprised a $1.4 billion  term loan  and a $600 million revolving
credit facility, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Both
portions paid an interest margin of 150 basis points more than
benchmark lending rates, the data show. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Officials in Aabar’s press office didn’t immediately reply
to an e-mail and telephone call seeking comment on the
financing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
