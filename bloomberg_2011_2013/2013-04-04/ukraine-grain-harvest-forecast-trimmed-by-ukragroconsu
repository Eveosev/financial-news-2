The Ukrainian grain-harvest forecast
for 2013 was cut to 52.4 million metric tons by agriculture
researcher UkrAgroConsult, from a previous estimate of 53
million tons, on a reduction in anticipated average yields.  Late resumption of winter-crop vegetation and late sowing
of spring crops may lower yields, UkrAgroConsult said today in
an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
