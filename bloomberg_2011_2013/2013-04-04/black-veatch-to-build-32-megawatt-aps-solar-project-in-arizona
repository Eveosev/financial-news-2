Black & Veatch Corp., a closely held
developer of energy and water projects, agreed to build a 32-
megawatt solar farm for  Arizona  Public Service Co.  Construction on the project in Gila Bend, Arizona, will
begin in October and is expected to be completed by June 2014,
according to a statement today from APS, the state’s largest
electric utility.  The plant will power as many as 8,000 homes and businesses,
according to the statement, which didn’t give a price. APS, a
unit of  Pinnacle West Capital Corp. (PNW) , has 86 megawatts of solar
farms in service and another 64 megawatts under construction or
in development.  The Gila Bend project is part of the Phoenix-based
utility’s AZ Sun Program to install 200 megawatts of new solar
power by 2015, according to its  website . Black & Veatch is based
in Overland Park, Kansas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
