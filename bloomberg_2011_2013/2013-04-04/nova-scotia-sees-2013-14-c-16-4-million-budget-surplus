Nova Scotia  will record a  budget
surplus  of C$16.4 million ($16.2 million) in the year that
started April 1, government documents project.  Nova Scotia,  Canada ’s fourth-smallest province by
population, made the forecast in its  budget  presented today by
Finance Minister Maureen MacDonald and posted on the
department’s website. The government estimates a deficit of
C$356 million in the fiscal year that ended March 31, wider than
a previous forecast of C$211 million.  The province predicts borrowing requirements of C$629.5
million for the 2013-14 fiscal year, down from C$1.35 billion in
the year just ended, budget documents show.  Nova Scotia will focus on issuing shorter-term debt in the
early part of the year, and then “will look to establish a new
10-year benchmark later this year,” Peter Urbanc, Nova Scotia’s
treasurer, said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
