Palm oil  exports from  Indonesia , the
world’s largest producer, jumped to the highest level in at
least five years in February after  China  and Pakistan boosted
purchases to benefit from a slump in prices.  Shipments, including palm and kernel oils, gained 9.1
percent to 2.04 million metric tons from 1.87 million tons in
January, according to data from the Indonesian Palm Oil
Association e-mailed today. That’s the most in a month at least
since 2008, according to the earliest available data from the
association compiled by Bloomberg, and it beat the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 1.51 million tons.  Rising exports may help trim Indonesian stockpiles and halt
a 34 percent decline in prices in  Kuala Lumpur  in the past year.
Indonesia’s inventories of the tropical oil used in everything
from noodles to biofuels dropped 14 percent to 3 million tons in
February from a month earlier, according to a Bloomberg survey
published Feb. 14.  “It seems that exporters were able to adapt to the new
imports rule in China that had caused some concern in January,”
said Fadhil Hasan,  executive director  at the growers’ group,
known as Gapki. Demand for Lunar new year festival in February
also boosted shipments, he said.  China imposed more stringent rules on edible oil  imports  to
improve food-safety standards with effect from Jan. 1 and
Indonesia’s exports to the Asian country fell 15 percent in
January. Shipments jumped 108 percent to 370,110 tons in
February and sales to  Pakistan  surged 80 percent to 149,850
tons, Gapki data showed.  Exports to India , the world’s largest
buyer, fell 13 percent to 699,770 tons and sales to European
Union dropped 22 percent to 305,120 tons, the data showed.  Futures in Kuala Lumpur, the global benchmark, fell 6.3
percent in February, the most since September. The contract for
delivery in June fell as much as 1.5 percent to 2,360 ringgit
($767) a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange today.  Palm oil and its by-products accounted for 93 percent of
Indonesia’s total February shipments, or 1.9 million tons, and
the remainder was palm kernel oils, the data showed. Exports in
the first two months of the year rose 29 percent to 3.9 million
tons from a year earlier, Gapki data showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
