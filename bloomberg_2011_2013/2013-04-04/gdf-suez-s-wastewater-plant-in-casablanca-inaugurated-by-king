GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA, the biggest Europen
utility by market value, said Morocco’s King Mohammed VI and
French President  Francois Hollande  inaugurated its Mediouna
wastewater treatment plant in Casablanca.  The facility, operated by a unit of  Suez Environnement (SEV) 
whose chief executive Jean-Louis Chaussade attended yesterday’s
ceremony with GDF Suez Chairman Gerard Mestrallet, is the first
sewage treatment plant in North Africa to use a membrane
filtration process, GDF Suez said in a statement.  The plant cost 141 million dirham ($16 million), according
to Middle East Online. The merger between Gaz de France SA and
Suez SA created the Paris-based utility in 2008 that’s 34
percent owned by the French government. GDF Suez operates in
Morocco in electricity generation, energy services, water
treatment and waste products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
