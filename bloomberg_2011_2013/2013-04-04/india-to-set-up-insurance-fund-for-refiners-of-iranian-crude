India  will set up an insurance fund
worth 20 billion rupees ($364 million) to cover refiners buying
crude from  Iran , a move that may help them continue purchasing
from the Persian Gulf state.  The fund, to be managed by India’s General Insurance Co.,
will start after the refiners contribute money to it, Banking
Secretary Rajiv Takru said in New Delhi today. The fund will not
be guaranteed by the state, he said.  Indian processors may cease buying Iranian crude as local
insurers refuse to cover the risks for using the oil, P.P. Upadhya, managing director at  Mangalore Refinery &
Petrochemicals Ltd. (MRPL) , said March 8.  The U.S. and its allies enacted sanctions in July to
restrict Iran’s oil exports, its largest source of revenue. The
countries are trying to pressure the Persian Gulf nation to curb
its nuclear program, which they say is designed to develop an
atomic weapon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
