Peru’s sol held at a one-week high
on speculation that demand for the currency will increase as
companies pay taxes and as banks reduced dollar holdings.  The sol closed unchanged at 2.5840 per  U.S. dollar  at
today’s close, according to prices from Datatec. It has
appreciated 0.9 percent since touching a 16-week low on March 6.  The period for monthly income tax payments starts April 9,
according to the website of Peru’s tax agency known as Sunat.
Banks’ net dollar holdings declined to $347 million yesterday
from $367 million the previous day, central bank data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Companies exchanging dollars will probably increase the
supply of soles while the central bank “may relax its
intervention a little as it has been doing in recent days,”
said Gonzalo Navarro, the head trader at Banco Santander SA’s
local unit.  The central bank has purchased $80 million of U.S. currency
this week, including $20 million today, after buying $300
million last week, according to its website.  The yield on  Peru ’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol bond due
August 2020 was little changed at 3.77 percent at 2:35 p.m. in
 Lima , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose
0.02 centimo to 125.76 centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
