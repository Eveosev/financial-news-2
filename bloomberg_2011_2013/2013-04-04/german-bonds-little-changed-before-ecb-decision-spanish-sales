German government bonds rose,
pushing 10-year yields to the lowest since August, after
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi signaled further
stimulus is possible should economic conditions deteriorate.  French and Austrian 10-year yields fell to records as
Draghi said monetary policy will “remain accommodative for as
long as needed” to boost growth. Spanish and Italian bonds
pared gains as the ECB president said the central bank won’t
immediately implement measures to ease funding strains for
smaller companies. Draghi spoke in  Frankfurt  after the ECB left
its key refinancing  rate  at an all-time low 0.75 percent.  “Low growth is very favorable for core bonds,” said
 Ciaran O’Hagan , head of European rates strategy at Societe
Generale in Paris. “Draghi kept open the prospect of a rate cut
and non standard measures.”  The German 10-year yields fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.25 percent at 4:30 p.m. in  London  after
dropping to 1.24 percent, the  lowest  since Aug. 2. The 1.5
percent bund due in February 2023 rose 0.375, or 3.75 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,285) face amount, to 102.325.  Euro-denominated sovereigns also rallied amid speculation
Japanese money managers will buy them after the Bank of  Japan 
said today that it will purchase more local bonds.  The BOJ plans to buy about 7.5 trillion yen ($78.4
billion) of bonds a month and double the monetary base,
which includes cash in circulation, in two years. That exceeded
economists’ median estimate of 5.2 trillion yen a month and is
the biggest move since quantitative easing began in 2001.  ‘Global Ramification’  “What the  Bank of Japan (8301)  did today has a significant global
ramification,” said Soeren Moerch, head of government-bond
trading at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Copenhagen. “There will be more
cheap money and that will benefit risk assets, including bonds
in  Europe .”  Draghi said risks to the euro area’s economic outlook
remained on the downside and inflation was “edging down well
below” the ECB’s 2 percent target.  “We will monitor very closely all incoming information on
economic and monetary developments and assess any impact on the
outlook for price stability,” he said after the meeting. The
ECB is “ready to act,” he said.  France’s 10-year yield dropped as much as 10 basis points
to 1.893 percent, the lowest since Bloomberg began compiling
data on the securities in 1990. Similar-maturity Austrian yields
slipped as much as seven basis points to 1.597 percent.  Service Activity  An index of  euro-region services activity  based on a survey
of purchasing managers declined to 46.4 last month from 47.9 in
February, London-based Markit Economics said. That’s below an
initial estimate of 46.5 published on March 21. A reading below
50 indicates contraction.  The Spanish 10-year bond yield was little changed at 4.91
percent after falling as much as nine basis points. The yield on
similar-maturity Italian debt fell three basis points to 4.54
percent after also declining as much as nine basis points.  Spanish two-year yields dropped to the  lowest level  in 2
1/2 years. The rate fell five basis points to 2.16 percent after
slipping to 2.07 percent, the least since October 2010.  Spain sold 4.3 billion euros of bonds due between 2016 and
2021, compared with the maximum target of 4 billion euros. The
nation allotted 3.06 billion euros of notes maturing in July
2016 at an  average yield  of 3.019 percent, up from 2.632 percent
at the previous auction on March 7.  France  sold 6.97 billion euros of debt, including 2 billion
euros of bonds due in 2022 at an average yield of 1.94 percent,
the lowest on record.  German debt returned 0.4 percent this year through
yesterday according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
bonds returned 3.8 percent and  Italy ’s gained 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
