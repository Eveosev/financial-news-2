Southern Co. (SO)  is investigating an
explosion at Plant Bowen, north of Atlanta, one of the largest
power generators in the U.S.  Southern, based in Atlanta, doesn’t know the cause of the
blast at the coal-fired plant, and its personnel are assessing
the extent of damages, Jacob Hawkins, a spokesman for the power
company’s Georgia Power utility, said today in a phone
interview.  Georgia Power said on Twitter that all plant employees were
accounted for following the accident, although one worker
suffered “minor” injuries.  Workers were shutting down Unit 2 at the 3,160-megawatt
plant for maintenance when the explosion occurred, Georgia Power
said.  Link to Company News:  To contact the reporter on this story:
