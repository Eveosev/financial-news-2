Euro-area  producer-price inflation 
slowed more than economists forecast in February led by easing
price growth for energy.  Factory-gate prices  in the 17-nation economy rose 1.3
percent from a year earlier, compared with a 1.7 percent
increase in the prior month, the European Union’s statistics
office in Luxembourg said today. Economists had forecast a
February rate of 1.4 percent, according to the median of 17
estimates in a  Bloomberg News survey  of economists. From the
prior month, prices increased 0.2 percent.  The European Central Bank meets today in  Frankfurt  to
decide on interest rates after a month in which euro-area
leaders fumbled a bailout of Cyprus and the euro fell to its
lowest level of the year against the dollar. ECB President Mario Draghi said on March 7 that underlying consumer price pressures
remain contained.  The ECB probably will leave its  benchmark rate  at a record
low of 0.75 percent, according to 54 of 56 economists in a
Bloomberg  survey . The decision is due at 1:45 p.m. in Frankfurt.  Energy costs at the producer level rose an annual 1.6
percent in February after a 2.2 percent increase in the previous
month, today’s report showed. Prices of intermediate goods rose
0.7 percent after a 1.3 percent gain in January.  In  Germany ,  Europe ’s largest economy, producer-price
inflation decelerated to 1.2 percent in February from 1.7
percent in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
