Prostitution was a thriving
occupation in 18th-century London. Most of those who traded
their charms for cash succumbed to disease, violence or
incarceration. The rest usually wound up in the workhouse.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Occasionally, a woman would hit the jackpot: Lavinia Fenton
was born illegitimate in 1710, and as she grew into a beauty,
her mother offered to sell her virginity for 200 pounds. She
wound up a child prostitute.  Since the theater gave women the chance to be seen by
noblemen, Lavinia went onstage: She was the first Polly Peachum
in John Gay’s “The Beggar’s Opera.” Charles Powlett, the Duke
of Bolton, fell deeply in love with her.  Estranged from the wife he’d been forced to marry, Powlett
made Lavinia his official mistress, with an annuity of 400
pounds a year, and she bore him three sons, who went on to
careers in the church and military.  When his wife died, Powlett married Lavinia and made her
the new Duchess of Bolton. At her death in 1760, she was a rich,
respectable widow.  I spoke with Jerry White, author of “A Great and Monstrous
Thing: London in the Eighteenth Century,” on the following
topics:  1. Flamboyant Wealth  2. Poor Dying in the Streets  3. Crime and Prostitution  4. Culture & Pleasure Gardens  5. Aristocrats’ Mistresses  To buy this book in North Amercia click  here .  (Lewis Lapham is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
