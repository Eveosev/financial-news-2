Anglo American Plc (AAL)  was downgraded by
 Standard & Poor’s  on concern the miner’s capital spending and
dividend payments will erode cash flow and boost borrowings.  “We expect Anglo American to generate much more negative
discretionary cash flow in 2013-2014 than we had assumed, which
should in turn result in higher adjusted debt,” S&P said today
in a statement. It reduced Anglo’s rating to BBB from BBB+, the
second-lowest investment grade.  The mining company, which swung to a loss last year after
writedowns, has sunk 27 percent in 12 months in London trading.
 Cynthia Carroll  quit as chief executive officer in October after
Anglo lost about $14 billion in value during her tenure and
suffered cost blowouts and delays at an $8.8 billion iron-ore
project in Brazil.  Mark Cutifani  took the helm yesterday.  In February, Anglo increased its dividend by 15 percent to
53 cents a share, citing an improving outlook for commodity
demand. Net debt was $8.6 billion at the end of last year.  S&P has a stable outlook on Anglo, it said in today’s
statement. The stock was up 1 percent at 1,667 pence as of 10:33
a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
