defines a bear market. Metal for immediate delivery has slumped
18.5 percent from its all-time high settlement of $1,900.23 in
September that year. Bullion rallied every year from 2001
through 2012 as investors sought protection from currency
debasement and potential inflation.  Gold futures for June delivery fell 0.4 percent to
$1,547.30 an ounce on the Comex in New York, after dropping to
