Gold dropped to the lowest since
May, nearing a  bear market , on signs that investors are seeking
higher returns in equities as the global economic recovery cuts
demand for haven assets. Palladium fell the most since October.  Global  holdings  of exchange-traded products backed by gold
are down 7.4 percent this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Prices have fallen 7.4 percent this year, while the MSCI All-
Country World Index of equities advanced 5 percent. The metal
may continue to decline as the resilience of the financial
system to recent developments in  Italy  and Cyprus suggests
reduced risk of a so-called major meltdown, Credit Suisse Group
AG said yesterday.  “Equities continue to attract more capital,” David Lee, a
vice president at Heraeus Precious Metals Management in  New
York , said in a telephone interview. “The safe-haven premium
for gold also seems to have disappeared with the world not
falling apart.”  Gold futures for June delivery fell 0.1 percent to settle
at $1,552.40 an ounce at 1:37 p.m. on the Comex in New York,
after dropping to $1,539.40, the lowest for a most-active
contract since May 30.  Prices have tumbled 17.9 percent from a record close of
$1,891.90 in August 2011, nearing the 20 percent that typically
defines a bear market. Metal for immediate delivery has slumped
18.2 percent from its all-time high settlement of $1,900.23 in
September that year. Bullion rallied every year from 2001
through 2012 as investors sought protection from currency
debasement and potential inflation.  Futures trading was 11 percent higher than the 100-day
average for this time of day.  ‘Stay Away’  Gold assets in ETPs tumbled 6.9 percent last quarter, the
most since at least 2004. Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the
biggest bullion-backed ETP, are at the lowest since July 2011.  “Investors choose to stay away or book profits after
record first-quarter ETF outflows,”  Andrey Kryuchenkov , a
London-based analyst at VTB Capital, wrote in a report today.
“Investor sentiment is likely to remain positive on equities
versus downbeat gold going forward.”.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , palladium futures for
June delivery retreated 4 percent to $725.45 an ounce, the
biggest loss since Oct. 23. Trading was 73 percent higher than
the 100-day average.  Silver futures for May delivery slid 0.1 percent to $26.767
an ounce on the Comex. Earlier, prices slumped as much as 0.8
percent to $26.575, the lowest since July 24.  Platinum futures for July delivery dropped 1.6 percent to
$1,517.80 an ounce on the Nymex. Earlier, prices dropped to
$1,511.10, the lowest since Aug. 31.  To contact the reporters on this story:
