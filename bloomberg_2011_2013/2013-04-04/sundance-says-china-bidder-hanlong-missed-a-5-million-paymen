Sundance Resources Ltd. (SDL) , which last
month flagged that a A$1.14 billion ($1.2 billion) bid by
Sichuan Hanlong Group may be scrapped, said the Chinese company
failed to make a A$5 million agreed payment.  Hanlong was due to make a tranche payment by yesterday
under a convertible note facility, the Perth-based company said
today in a statement. Sundance has issued a “demand notice”
saying it must make the payment no later than April 8.  The bid by closely held Hanlong, whose billionaire Chairman
Liu Han reportedly is in police custody after going missing last
month, may unravel after Chengdu-based Hanlong failed to meet a
March 26 funding deadline for the takeover. Sundance needs an
investment of $4.7 billion for its Mbalam project, straddling
the border between Cameroon and Republic of Congo.  The companies remain in incomplete and confidential talks,
Sundance said. Either party may terminate the deal during a 10-
business day period which starts on April 8, the company said.  Sundance’s shares were suspended March 19 after trading in
Sydney at 21 cents, below Hanlong’s offer of 45 cents a share,
signaling investors don’t expect the deal to succeed. Hanlong,
which holds about  14 percent  of Sundance, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg, in August cut its bid for Sundance by 21
percent to 45 cents. The shares have fallen more than 46 percent
since Nov. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
