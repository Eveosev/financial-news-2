Indonesian search teams have found
the cockpit voice recorder from the  Sukhoi (OKBS)  SuperJet 100 plane
that crashed last week, according to  Russia ’s Industry and Trade
Ministry.  While the recorder was heavily burnt, the data are likely
to be recovered, ministry spokeswoman Ekaterina Ryzhaya said by
telephone in Moscow. Russian technicians and equipment will help
decode the data, she said.  The flight data recorder with technical information on the
aircraft’s systems has not been found, Ryzhaya said. The plane
crashed May 9 into a mountainside in  Indonesia ’s West Java
province, killing all 45 people on board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
