Conergy AG (CGYK) , a German solar-panel
maker, won orders to develop two photovoltaic power plants in
the Trier area, including at a former military site.  The Trier municipal utility commissioned Conergy to build a
1.2-megawatt plant near the A1 highway and a 1-megawatt facility
between Trier and Bitburg, the Hamburg-based company said today
in an e-mailed statement. No terms were given.  To contact the reporter on this story:
