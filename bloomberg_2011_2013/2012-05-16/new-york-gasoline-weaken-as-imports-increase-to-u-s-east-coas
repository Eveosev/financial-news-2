New York  gasoline weakened after a
government report showed imports of the fuel to the East Coast
increased last week.  Shipments of the motor fuel to the region rose 18 percent
to 630,000 barrels a day in the seven days ended May 11,
according to the Energy Department.  Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  was said to be
restarting a Philadelphia crude unit yesterday that has been
shut since a fire May 9.  Conventional gasoline to be blended with ethanol, or CBOB,
in New York Harbor slipped 1 cent to a 0.5 cent a gallon
discount versus futures traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 2:58 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Prompt delivery fell 3.32 cents to $2.9159 a gallon.  Sunoco workers repaired a hole and began returning the
crude unit to service, said a person familiar with the
operations yesterday who declined to be identified because heâ€™s
not authorized to speak for the refinery.  Crude unit 137 at the Philadelphia plant can process
200,000 barrels a day, according to Genscape Inc., an energy
information provider based in Louisville,  Kentucky .  To contact the reporter on this story:
