Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) ,
owner of the Horizon oil sands project, expects the spread
between Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate to collapse as
the reversed Seaway pipeline is completed and expanded.  The spread should be equal to about the $4-a-barrel cost of
cost of shipping on the line once its expansion and twinning is
completed in 2013, Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. President
Steve Laut said at an investor presentation in Calgary.  “This is good news for all North American oil producers,”
Laut said. By 2013 the expanded Seaway pipeline and the addition
of the Cushing Marketlink pipeline will ease a glut of oil now
trapped at the Cushing, Oklahoma, hub, he said.  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  and  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  may start
shipping on the first phase of the Seaway line tomorrow. The
500-mile (805-kilometer) will now move oil to the U.S. Gulf
Coast from Cushing.  TransCanada Corp. (TRP)  has proposed the Cushing
Marketlink, which would carry crude to  Port Arthur , Texas, from
the Oklahoma hub.  Canadian Natural’s Horizon project is capable of producing
about 110,000 barrels a day of refinery-ready crude from oil-
laden sand mined in northeastern Alberta.  U.S. Gulf Coast refineries could boost their ability to
process heavier Canadian crudes by 1 million barrels daily if
they had access to the lower-cost oil through new pipelines,
Canadian Natural Vice President Bill Peterson said in a separate
presentation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
