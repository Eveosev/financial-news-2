Australia ’s dollar declined to the
weakest level this year as Greece’s failure to form a new
government spurred speculation it may leave the euro area,
sapping demand for riskier assets.  The so-called Aussie was near a four-month low against the
yen as Asian stocks fell for a sixth-straight day, extending a
global equities rout. The  New Zealand dollar  dropped for a
fourth day after Auckland-based Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd.,
the world’s largest dairy exporter, said whole-milk powder
prices continued their slide, falling to the lowest level in
more than 2 1/2 years.  “It’s just a general bout of  risk aversion  around the
globe,” said Derek Mumford, a director in Sydney at Rochford
Capital, a currency risk management company. “It’s not just
 Greece , it’s the whole European situation. The Aussie is
certainly under pressure.”  Australia’s dollar touched 98.90 U.S. cents, the weakest
since Dec. 19, before trading at 98.92 as of 4:22 p.m. in
Sydney, 0.5 percent below the close in  New York  yesterday. The
currency bought 79.50 yen from 79.67 yesterday, when it slid to
79.39, the lowest since Jan. 17.  Mumford predicts the Australian currency will drop as low
as 97.50 U.S. cents within the next couple of weeks.  The  New Zealand  dollar lost 0.5 percent to 76.56 U.S.
cents, after sliding to 76.48, the least since Dec. 20. It was
at 61.52 yen from 61.69, after falling to as low as 61.49, the
weakest since Jan. 19.  Greek Election  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of stocks dropped 2.6 percent
today. The MSCI World Index of developed market shares fell 0.9
percent yesterday.  Greek leaders will seek agreement today on an interim
government that will schedule new elections as early as June 10,
after President Karolos Papoulias failed to broker a governing
coalition in meetings yesterday.  The new election will follow an inconclusive May 6 vote
that boosted a political party opposed to Greece’s international
bailout into second place. Public opinion polls say that party,
Syriza, may come in first next time, complicating Greece’s
efforts to avoid running out of cash by early July.  Elsewhere in  Europe , investor concern over  Spain ’s ability
to reduce its budget shortfall has increased since Prime
Minister  Mariano Rajoy  announced in March that the country will
miss a 2012 deficit goal set by the European Union.  Spanish 10-
year yields  this week climbed as high as 6.36 percent, the most
since Nov. 30.  Milk Prices  In New Zealand, Fonterra said milk powder for July delivery
fell 9.6 percent from the May 1 sale to the lowest price since
August 2009, according to a trade-weighted index. The near-term
contract fell for the 11th straight auction to $2,488 a metric
ton, the company said on its GlobalDairyTrade website.  The results “only add to the evidence suggesting next
season’s Fonterra dairy payout will be considerably lower than
the season just ending,”  Mike Jones , a currency strategist at
Bank of New Zealand Ltd. in Wellington, wrote in a research
note.  Demand for Australia’s currency was also limited after a
private survey showed the nation’s  consumer confidence  was
little changed near the lowest level this year as concern about
the global outlook countered the boost provided by this month’s
decision by the country’s central bank to lower borrowing costs.  The sentiment index for May rose 0.8 percent to 95.3, a
 Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  and Melbourne Institute survey taken May
7-11 of 1,200 consumers showed today in Sydney. From a year
earlier, confidence is down 8.3 percent.  Yields on Australia’s benchmark 10-year notes slid three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.23 percent today.
The rate touched a record low of 3.201 percent yesterday. Three-
year yields fell four basis points today to 2.56 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
