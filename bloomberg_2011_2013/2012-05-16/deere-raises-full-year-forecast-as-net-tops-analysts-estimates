Deere & Co. (DE) , the world’s largest
maker of agricultural equipment, raised its full-year earnings
forecast and posted fiscal second-quarter profit that topped
analysts’ estimates after higher crop prices supported farming
incomes in the U.S.  Net income climbed to $1.06 billion, or $2.61 a share, in
the quarter ended April 30, from $904.3 million, or $2.12, a
year earlier, Moline, Illinois-based Deere said today in a
statement. That beat the $2.53-a-share average of 18 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Equipment sales rose 13 percent to $9.4
billion from $8.3 billion, compared with the 15 percent gain
that Deere forecast in February.  Profit for the full fiscal year will be $3.35 billion,
compared with $3.28 billion Deere forecast in February and the
$3.24 billion average of 15 estimates. The company reiterated
that equipment sales for the full fiscal year will gain about 15
percent.  “In  North America , major crop receipts are headed for
another strong year after record levels in 2011,”  Ann Duignan ,
a New York-based analyst for JPMorgan Chase & Co. who has a buy
rating on Deere, said in a report May 14. “ Europe  continues its
agricultural recovery.”  Deere is selling more tractors and other machinery after a
three-year rally in corn and soybean prices pushed farm receipts
to a record in the U.S. in 2011, its largest market. Higher
equipment volumes in established markets will help Chief
Executive Officer Samuel R. Allen as he also chases additional
revenue in developing markets such as Brazil and  China  to reach
a goal of $50 billion in sales by 2018.  U.S. farm cash receipts, the primary driver of
agricultural-machinery purchases, will be $371.9 billion this
year after rising to a record $381.4 billion in 2011, Deere said
in a February presentation. That accumulated income will help
farmers to continue to buy new machines, Duignan said.  While corn prices have dropped in the past two months after
forecasts for a higher acreage this season, inventories are
still tighter than historical averages and will support U.S.
farm sales, Andy Kaplowitz, a New York-based analyst for
Barclays Plc, said in a May 14 note.  Farm income in the European Union rose 6.7 percent in 2011
from a year earlier, according to  Eurostat . British growers’
profit last year reached the highest since 1996, according to
the U.K.  government .  To contact the reporter on this story:
