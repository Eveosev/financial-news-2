Israel Discount Bank Ltd. (DSCT)  dropped to
the lowest level in three years after  MSCI Inc. (MSCI)  said Israel’s
third largest bank by assets will be removed from the index
provider’s Global Standard Indices.  The shares fell 3.8 percent to 4.425 shekels, the lowest
level since May 2009, at 11:12 a.m. in Tel Aviv.  The decline “may be linked to the announcement that the
bank shares will be deleted from the MSCI Israel Index,” said
Zach Herzog, head of international sales at Psagot Investment
House Ltd. in Tel Aviv said by phone today.  MSCI said today it will remove Israel Discount Bank,
 Cellcom Israel Ltd. (CEL)  and Partner Communications Co. from the MSCI
Israel Index as of close May 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
