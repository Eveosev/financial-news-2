California-blend gasoline in  San
Francisco  fell to the lowest level against futures this month
after the state Energy Commission said total supplies climbed
for the first time in five weeks.  Inventories rose 3.8 percent in the week ended May 11 to
5.67 million barrels after refineries boosted production of  non-
California-blend fuel , the commission said in an e-mailed
report.  California-blend, or Carbob, gasoline  stocks slipped 2.7
percent to 4.36 million barrels.  Carbob in San Francisco dropped for a fourth day, declining
4 cents to a premium of 23 cents a gallon above gasoline futures
traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 3:25 p.m. in New
York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
narrowest premium for the fuel since April 30.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , based in  The Hague , finished work at
the 158,000-barrel-a-day Martinez refinery in Northern
California, Emily Oberton, a company spokeswoman in Houston,
said in an e-mail yesterday. The plant shut a catalytic cracker
April 21 for maintenance, according to a filing with county
regulators.  BP Plc (BP/)  is starting the crude unit at the 266,000-barrel-a-
day Cherry Point refinery in Washington state, a person familiar
with operations there said yesterday. The unit is expected to
resume service later this week, the person said.  Los Angeles Carbob climbed 0.5 cent to a 27.5-cent premium
against gasoline futures.  Carbob Production  Carbob production  dropped 14 percent last week to 5.82
million barrels, the lowest level in at least 10 years, the
Energy Commission said.  California-blend diesel , or CARB diesel, supplies fell 17
percent last week, and  non-CARB diesel  inventories slipped 4.2
percent, the state’s report shows.  Total distillate production 
increased 9.4 percent to 2.15 million barrels.  CARB diesel in  Los Angeles  slid 2 cents to a premium of 7.5
cents a gallon against Nymex heating oil futures. The same fuel
in San Francisco dropped 2.5 cents to 8 cents above futures.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland ,  Oregon ,
tumbled 7.5 cents to a 60-cent premium versus gasoline futures.
Low-sulfur diesel  there  rose 1 cent to 36.5 cents a gallon above
heating oil futures.  Gasoline inventories on the U.S. West Coast, known as the
Padd 5 region, fell to the lowest level since 1999, dropping 3.3
percent to 25.3 million barrels, the Energy Department said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
