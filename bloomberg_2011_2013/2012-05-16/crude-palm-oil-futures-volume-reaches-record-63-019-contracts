Crude palm-oil futures traded a
record 63,019 contracts on the  Malaysia  Derivatives Exchange
today, surpassing the previous all-time high of 48,741 contracts
on Nov. 17, the bourse said.  “This is attributed to increased hedging activities
resulting from the volatility and uncertainty” in global
markets, it said in a statement sent by e-mail.  The size of each contract is 25 metric tons. That means
that the exchange traded 1.58 million tons of crude palm oil
today, or 24 percent more than April production in Malaysia,
the world's second-biggest producer, according to Bloomberg
calculations.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
