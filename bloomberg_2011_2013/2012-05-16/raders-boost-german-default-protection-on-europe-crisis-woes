Investors are amassing record amounts
of insurance on German government debt on concern  Europe ’s
biggest economy will suffer from the region’s worsening crisis.  The net amount of credit-default swaps outstanding on
German bonds surged for a fourth week, climbing by $260 million
in the period through May 11 to $20.5 billion, according to the
Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. That’s up from $16.1 billion
last June.  Germany  is the largest contributor to Europe’s bailout
packages for  Greece  and a collapse of that nation’s economy and
its possible exit from the euro area may weigh heavily on
 Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s administration. Panagiotis
Pikrammenos will head a caretaker government in Greece ahead of
a new round of elections on June 17, state-run Athens News
Agency reported.  “A euro breakup is going to be a burden on Germany as well
as on any of the others,” said  Elisabeth Afseth , an analyst at
Investec Bank Plc in London. “The alternative is a large scale
bailout, which would obviously also add to German liabilities.
It’s hard to see a very positive outcome in any case there.”  The cost of insuring German debt is soaring, even as its
bond yields fall. Credit-default swaps on Germany jumped 10
basis points this week to a four-month high of 98, signaling
worsening perceptions of  credit quality . The contracts cost 67
basis points March 19.  Bond Sale  Germany sold 4.107 billion euros ($5.2 billion) of 10-year
bonds at a record low average yield of 1.47 percent, according
to data today from the Bundesbank. The nation’s 10-year bond
yields were four basis points from an all-time low at 1.47
percent.  Swaps on  Spain  soared as much as seven basis points to a
record 553, before falling two basis points to 544. Contracts on
 Italy  climbed eight basis points to 510.25 and swaps on Ireland
rose 8.5 basis points to 663, both four-month highs.  “If you get a Greek exit or threat of such, it will be
more difficult for Ireland to come back to the market,” Afseth
said. “If Greece leaves, a precedent has been set for a country
leaving the single currency and the issue of contagion is quite
real.”  The cost of insuring European corporate and financial debt
also rose today.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of swaps linked to 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings increased 16
basis points to 751. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125
companies with investment-grade ratings advanced for a seventh
day, climbing 6.25 basis points to 180.25. Both are the highest
since Jan. 9.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers rose 6.5 basis points to 295.5 and the
subordinated index jumped 11 to 486.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
