Two candidates will run in
 Singapore ’s by-election this month for a seat in Parliament
that’s been held by the opposition for the past two decades.  The candidates, the ruling People’s Action Party’s Desmond
Choo and Png Eng Huat from the Workers’ Party, filed their
nomination papers for the race to represent Hougang constituency
today, according to Returning Officer Yam Ah Mee.  The poll on May 26 comes one year after Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s party retained power at the general elections with
the smallest margin of popular votes since independence in 1965.
A record number of citizens cast their ballots last year and
tripled the number of opposition members in Parliament.  The candidates are seeking to fill the seat vacated by Yaw
Shin Leong from the Workers’ Party in February. Yaw, who won
64.8 percent of the votes for the district, was expelled after
“indiscretions in his private life” and for “continuing not
to account to the party and the people,” the party said at the
time.  The seat in Hougang, a suburb in north-eastern Singapore,
was held by Workers’ Party Secretary-General Low Thia Khiang
from 1991 until last year’s polls. Low left the district to lead
a team of five from his party to the first victory of a group
constituency by an opposition group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
