(Corrects total amount of EFSF bonds sold since 2011 in
third paragraph)  Japan  purchased 8.3 percent of the
debt sold by the European Financial Stability Facility
yesterday, a Japanese Finance Ministry official said.  The nation bought 80 million euros ($102 million) of the
960 million euros in five-year bonds, the official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity because of the ministry’s
policy.  Japan has purchased about 11 percent of the 46.4 billion
euros of EFSF bonds sold since January 2011, according to the
official.  Finance Minister  Jun Azumi  said yesterday that he is paying
“utmost attention” to the political developments in Greece and
he wants the country to come up with solutions to ease global
concern about the region’s debt crisis.  Talks between  Greece ’s main parties following the May 6
elections failed to reach agreement on forming a coalition,
forcing the country to hold a second election next month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
