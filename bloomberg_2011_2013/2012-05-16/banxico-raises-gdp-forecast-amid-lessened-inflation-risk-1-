Mexico ’s central bank raised its
growth forecast for this year and said the risk from inflation
has diminished, according to its quarterly inflation report
published today.  Banco de Mexico  boosted its estimate for the expansion in
 Latin America ’s second-biggest economy to a range of 3.25
percent to 4.25 percent from its prior projection of 3 percent
to 4 percent, according to the  report . Inflation risks have
abated and consumer prices will probably increase at the lower
end of the bank’s 3 percent to 4 percent anticipated range, the
lender said.  Mexico’s central bank board kept the key  interest rate 
unchanged at 4.5 percent for a 26th consecutive meeting last
month, while signaling willingness to cut should global monetary
policy remain loose and European financial markets stabilize.
Since then, inflation has slowed for a third consecutive month
in April, while stocks worldwide have fallen after  Greece  failed
to form a new government.  The annual inflation rate fell to a six-month low of 3.41
percent in April from 3.73 percent the month before, the
national statistics agency said May 9.  Even before that, economists had cut their year-end
inflation forecast to an average 3.68 percent this month from
3.78 percent in April and 3.88 percent in March, according to a
monthly survey by the central bank.  The central bank, which targets inflation of 3 percent,
plus or minus one percentage point, holds its next policy
meeting on June 8.  The yield on inflation-linked securities due in December
2012 known as Udibonos, fell 113 basis points, or 1.13
percentage points, to 0.64 percent this month through yesterday.  The peso has declined 5.5 percent in the month to date, the
fourth-worst performance against the dollar of 16 major
currencies tracked by Bloomberg, as the crisis in  Europe  has set
off renewed volatility.  The peso rose 0.4 percent to 13.7825 per dollar at 1:21
p.m. local time from 13.8363 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
