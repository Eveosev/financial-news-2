OAO Gazprom (OGZPY)  and  OAO Lukoil’s (LUKOY)  U.S.-
traded shares are fetching a discount to their Moscow stock for
the first time in three years after oil tumbled faster in New
York than in  London .  Gazprom,  Russia ’s biggest company and the world’s largest
natural gas producer, retreated 1.5 percent yesterday to trade
at a 1.3 percent discount, while oil producer Lukoil fell 2.3
percent to trade 0.4 percent lower than the Moscow shares. The
 Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the most-traded Russian
companies declined to a five-month low. Internet company  Yandex
NV (YNDX)  led gains before  Facebook Inc. (FB)  shares start trading tomorrow.  Oil, Russia’s major export earner, fell to the lowest level
in more than six months in  New York  yesterday, extending a 9.8
percent slide over the past month, as U.S. supplies grew to the
most since 1990. Brent oil for June settlement lost 5.9 percent
during the same period in London as concerns the European Union
will ban crude imports from Iran in July cushioned the decline.  “Both Gazprom and Lukoil, Russian energy stocks overall,
are very sensitive to crude oil price,”  Alexei Kokin , chief
analyst for energy companies at UralSib Financial Corp, said by
phone from Moscow, commenting on Russian stocks traded in U.S.
“They move together with oil price and when oil falls those
stocks sometimes fall even more than oil does.”  The Bloomberg Russia index lost 0.9 percent to 88.52
yesterday, the lowest since Dec. 19. Futures expiring in June on
Russia’s  RTS (RTSI$)  Index dropped 0.8 percent to 135,170 in U.S.
trading. The Russia-US Index trades at 5.7 times estimated
earnings, about a 40 percent discount to the 9.8 valuation for
the average company on the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index and the
9.3 multiple for stocks on Brazil’s Bovespa benchmark.  ‘Time to Buy’  Gazprom declined 1.5 percent to $9.30 in New York
yesterday, sending valuations to 2.9 times estimated earnings,
less than half the 6.2 average multiple for energy companies on
the MSCI Emerging Markets index. The Moscow-based company’s
 stock  fell 1.5 percent to 146.08 rubles, or $4.71, on the Micex
yesterday. One Gazprom ADR is equal to two ordinary shares.  Lukoil, the country’s second-biggest oil producer behind
 OAO Rosneft (ROSN) , retreated 2.3 percent to $53.29 yesterday in New
York, the lowest since Dec. 30. The decline pushed valuation to
3.8 times estimated earnings, an almost 40 percent discount to
the average multiple for energy companies on the MSCI measure.
Lukoil fell 1.7 percent to 1,657.90 rubles, or $53.48, on
Russia’s Micex Index.  Gazprom and Lukoil ADRs traded over the past week at a
discount to the Moscow shares for the first time since November
2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “It’s time to buy, as Russian companies are extremely
cheap,”  Ivan Mazalov , director of Prosperity Capital
Management, which manages about $4 billion in assets, said by
phone from Moscow yesterday. “Investors get frightened because
of European problems and the Greek political crisis. Russia is
so cheap compared to other emerging markets.”  Capital Outflows  Stocks and commodities fell yesterday as talks to form a
coalition government in Greece collapsed, raising concern that
Europe’s debt crisis will worsen.  Russia’s capital outflows reached $42 billion in the first
four months of this year, central bank Chairman Sergey Ignatiev
told lawmakers yesterday in the State Duma, the lower house of
parliament, citing preliminary data.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, retreated 0.4 percent to $25.62, the
lowest since Oct. 5. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures
expected swings in futures, fell 0.2 percent to 36.68 points.  Crude oil for June delivery dropped 1.2 percent, to $92.81
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
settlement since Nov. 2. Prices have fallen 15 percent since
closing at the 2012 high of $109.77 a barrel on Feb. 24.  Discount  New York crude “is trading at a discount to both Brent and
Urals, which are very close to each other, because of the
dynamics particular to the US storage of oil,” Ilya Kravets, an
analyst at ED Capital LLC in New York, which manages $100
million including Russian equities, said by e-mail yesterday.  Brent oil for June settlement slipped 0.5 percent to
$111.71 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange.  Urals crude , Russia’s chief export blend, fell 1.5
percent to $108.49 a barrel.  Polyus Gold International Ltd. (PLZLY) , Russia’s biggest gold
producer, dropped 4.1 percent to $2.60, the lowest level since
July 27.  Gold futures for June delivery fell 1.3 percent to settle
at $1,536.60 on the Comex yesterday. Gold has slid 19 percent
from a record close of $1,891.90 reached on Aug. 22, about 1
percentage point shy of a  bear market  in New York.  Facebook  Yandex NV, the owner of Russia’s most-used search engine,
rose 3.3 percent to $22.18, pushing valuations to 27 times
estimated earnings, compared with 14 for  Google Inc. (GOOG)   Facebook’s shares are set to price today and begin trading
under the symbol FB on the Nasdaq Stock Market tomorrow.  The world’s most popular social network’s initial public
offering is fueling investors’ appetite for Yandex, Iouli
Matevossov, a senior analyst at  Alfa Bank  said.  “ Facebook IPO  warms it up for Yandex,” Matevossov said on
May 14 by phone from Moscow. He recommends investors hold
Yandex shares, with a price target at $27.  The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  lost 0.7 percent to 1,335.10 in
Moscow yesterday, the lowest since Oct. 6. The dollar-
denominated RTS index fell 0.3 percent to 1,369.40, the lowest
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
