Turkish businesses will ask  Iran  to
drop transit taxes that cost $400 million last year, seeking to
lift obstacles to double trade between the countries, Sabah
 reported .  Iran is taxing only Turkish trucks and selling them fuel at
four times the local price, Ali Osman Ulusoy, the co-head of the
Turkey-Iran Business Council at the Foreign Economic Relations
Board, an Istanbul-based trade advocacy group, according to the
newspaper. Ulusoy is leading a delegation to  Turkey â€™s eastern
neighbor May 21-23 to discuss the matters.  U.S. embargoes against Iran are helping smugglers because
they restricts money transfers, Ulusoy said, Sabah reported.
Iranian companies in Turkey are interested in building an auto-
related factory in the Black Sea province of Trabzon and
investing in hotels, the newspaper said, citing Ulusoy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
