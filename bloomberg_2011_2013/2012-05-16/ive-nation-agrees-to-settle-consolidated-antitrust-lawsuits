Live Nation Entertainment Inc. (LYV)  said
it agreed to settle 22 consumer antitrust class-action lawsuits
dating back to 2002 that were consolidated in federal court in
 Los Angeles .  “The parties in all twenty-two actions have reached a
global settlement agreement, which is in the process of being
finalized,” Live Nation said in a filing yesterday. Terms of
the settlement weren’t disclosed in the filing, in which lawyers
asked U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson to put the case on hold
while the settlement is completed.  Wilson in March rejected expert testimony about the harm
concert ticket buyers sustained from alleged anti-competitive
practices.  Representatives of Live Nation didn’t immediately respond
to an e-mailed request for comment on the settlement.  Steve
Berman , a lawyer for the plaintiffs, didn’t immediately return a
call to his office.  The case is Live Concert Antitrust Litigation, 06-01745,
U.S. District Court, Central District of California (Los
Angeles.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
