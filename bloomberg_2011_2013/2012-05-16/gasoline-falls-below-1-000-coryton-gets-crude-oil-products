Gasoline for immediate loading in
northwest Europe traded at less than $1,000 a metric ton for the
first time in more than three months.  Gasoil futures declined for a fourth day as  Brent crude 
dropped. The Coryton refinery in the U.K., which is operating
under a tolling deal that runs out later today, will receive its
second crude cargo in two days, according to IHS Inc. ship-
tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.  Light Products  Gasoline barges for loading in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp
traded at $995 to $998 a ton, according to a survey of brokers
and traders monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board. That compares
with yesterday’s deals at $1,004 to $1,017. The fuel last traded
below $1,000 on Feb. 3, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Total SA was the main seller of the Eurobob grade to which
ethanol is added to make finished fuel. Barge deals are
typically for lots of 1,000 tons or 2,000 tons.  Gasoline’s  crack , or premium to Brent, rose to $8.28 a
barrel as of 11 a.m. local time, according to data from PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a refined-products broker in London. That
compares with $8.22 yesterday  Naphtha’s  discount  to Brent narrowed to $11.09 a barrel,
PVM data show. That compares with $11.35 yesterday, the widest
spread since Nov. 30.  “The glut of naphtha in Europe is not being cleared,”
 Olivier Jakob , managing director at Petromatrix GmbH, a Zug,
Switzerland-based researcher, said today in a note. “European
naphtha needs to go to a deeper discount to push itself out to
the  Far East .”  Middle Distillates  Gasoil for June delivery fell 0.3 percent to $929.25 a ton
as of 11:42 a.m. local time on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange
in London. The July contract was at $926.75, causing the
discount to front-month futures, or backwardation, to widen to
$3 from $2.50 yesterday.  Gasoil’s  crack , a measure of refining profitability,
increased to $13.61 a barrel from $13.53 yesterday. Brent
declined 0.9 percent to $111.25 a barrel.  Refineries  The Eagle Tucson is scheduled to arrive in Coryton later
today, the IHS ship-tracking data show. It is sailing from
Teesport in northeast  England  and carried about 586,000 barrels
of fuel on its last voyage, according to shipbroker data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The shipment is the refinery’s second in as many days
before a supply agreement with Morgan Stanley, KKR & Co. and
AtlasInvest ends at midnight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
