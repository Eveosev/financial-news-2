Syrian President Bashar al-Assad told
a Russian state news channel that the public in the country
support his reform plans.  Parliamentary elections on May 7 showed the support of the
country’s citizens for the government’s program, Assad said in
an interview broadcast on state-run Rossiya 24 television today.  Assad’s security forces are trying to crush a 14-month-old
rebellion against his rule. A United Nations cease-fire plan has
failed to curb the violence. Syrian security forces killed 21
people today,  Al Arabiya  reported.  Fifty-one percent of Syrian voters took part in the
election, Khalaf al-Ezzawi, head of the elections panel, told a
news conference on state television yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
