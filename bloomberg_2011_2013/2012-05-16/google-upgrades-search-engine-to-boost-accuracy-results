Google Inc. (GOOG)  is upgrading its search
engine with a new database to provide results with better
accuracy and additional information as it pushes back against
growing competition.  The service is based on the “Knowledge Graph,” a two-year
effort to build a collection of 500 million people, places and
things on the Internet that are identified by how they’re
connected, said Ben Gomes, a Google fellow. Users will have
options for filtering results and may see a summary of relevant
content on the right side of the page.  “It’s a different way of thinking about search,” Gomes,
who helps lead search efforts at Google, said in an interview
yesterday. “It can take you from your current query to whole
new avenues of exploration.”  Google is adding features to its services to maintain its
user base and stave off competition from  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s Bing
search engine. Microsoft unveiled a design for Bing earlier this
month that adds more social components to related search
functions by including content from a user’s online friends, in
addition to regular query results.  Mountain View , California-based Google had 67 percent of
the U.S. search-engine market in April, while No. 2 Bing had 15
percent, according to  ComScore  Inc.  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) , which is
powered by Bing, had 14 percent.  Google’s new service will let users narrow results to
differentiate between a sports team name, such as “Kings,” and
the TV series. It also aims to help users discover additional
facts on a topic with information derived from the Knowledge
Graph.  To contact the reporter on this story:
