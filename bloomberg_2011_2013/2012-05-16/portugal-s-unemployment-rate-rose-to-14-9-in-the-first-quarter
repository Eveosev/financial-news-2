Portugal’s  jobless rate  rose to 14.9
percent in the three months through March as the country’s
economy contracted for a sixth quarter.  The  unemployment rate  increased from 14 percent in the
fourth quarter and 12.4 percent in the first quarter of 2011,
the Lisbon-based National Statistics Institute said today in an
e-mailed statement.  Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  is facing a recession as
he cuts spending and increases taxes to meet the terms of a 78
billion-euro ($99 billion) aid plan from the European Union and
the  International Monetary Fund . As the country’s borrowing
costs surged, Portugal last year followed Greece and Ireland in
seeking a bailout.  For all of 2012, the government forecasts unemployment will
rise to 14.5 percent before declining to 14.1 percent in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
