Target Corp. (TGT) , the second-largest U.S.
discount retailer, raised its full-year earnings forecast after
warm weather helped drive sales in the first quarter.  Profit this year will be as much as $4.30, up from a
previous forecast of a maximum of $4.25, the Minneapolis-based
company said today in a statement. Analysts projected $4.26, the
average of 23  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Target increased same-store sales 5.3 percent in the first
quarter, its best performance in six years, as the warmest
temperatures in  North America  in 50 years encouraged shopping.
The company’s push into offering more food and deals through a
discount card also continued to boost revenue.  Target  rose  1.3 percent to $55.82 at 10:11 a.m. in New
York. The shares had gained 7.5 percent this year before today.  Net income in the quarter ended April 28 rose 1.2 percent
to $697 million, or $1.04 a share, from $689 million, or 99
cents, a year earlier. Analysts projected $1.01, the average of
20  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Investments to open stores
in  Canada  lowered profit by about 8 cents a share, Target said.  Gross margin at the company’s U.S. retail segment narrowed
for the seventh straight quarter. First-quarter gross margin,
the percentage of sales left after subtracting the cost of goods
sold, shrank to 30.2 percent from 30.4 percent a year earlier.
Analysts projected 31 percent, the average of nine  estimates .  The company’s credit card unit, which had boosted earnings
in the past year, became less profitable. Income at the segment
declined 28 percent to $139 million from $194 million a year
earlier. Bad debt expense rose more than fourfold to $52
million. The retailer suspended plans to sell the division in
January and said it would start looking for potential partners
later this year.  The percentage of sales being made through its REDCard
discount program rose to 11.6 percent from 7.6 percent a year
earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
