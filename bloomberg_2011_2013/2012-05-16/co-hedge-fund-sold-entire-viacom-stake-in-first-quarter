Children’s Investment Fund Management
UK LLP, the London-based hedge fund run by Christopher Cooper- Hohn, sold its entire stake in  Viacom (VIAB)  Inc. in the first quarter.  TCI sold 4.3 million shares valued at $194.5 million as of
March 31, according to a filing today with the U.S. Securities
and Commission. The stake in the New York-based media company
was TCI’s third-biggest U.S. holding at the end of 2011.  Viacom, which owns the MTV and Nickelodeon cable channels,
rose 4.5 percent in the first quarter after gaining 17 percent
in the last three months of 2011. Other  hedge funds  that sold
Viacom shares this year include Eric Mindich’s Eton Park Capital
Management LP, which reduced its stake by 59 percent to 4.5
million shares.  TCI officials didn’t immediately return a phone call
seeking comment.  Cooper-Hohn started TCI in 2003, which earmarks a portion
of the fees it receives from clients to the Children’s
Investment Fund Foundation. The foundation is a charity run by
his wife, Jaime.  TCI’s biggest U.S. holding remains  News Corp. (NWSA) , the media
company run by  Rupert Murdoch  that has been embroiled in a
phone-hacking scandal. TCI owned 50 million shares valued $985
million as of March 31, down from 51.6 million shares at the end
of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
