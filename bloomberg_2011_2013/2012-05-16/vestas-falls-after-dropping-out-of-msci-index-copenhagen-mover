Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the world’s
largest wind turbine maker, fell to a nine-year low in
Copenhagen trading as the stock exits the  MSCI Denmark (MXDK)  Index
following this year’s 36 percent share decline.  Vestas fell as much as 4.5 percent to 38.88 kroner, the
lowest price since March 2003. The stock  retreated  1.26 kroner,
or 3.1 percent, to 39.46 kroner at 1:41 p.m. in the Danish
capital.  “When Vestas falls out of the MSCI  Denmark , investors who
are linking their portfolio to indexes will have to sell the
stock and that’s causing today’s drop,” Mads Zink, chief share
trader at Danske Bank A/S in Copenhagen, said by phone.  Vestas will officially exit the  index , which includes
Denmark’s 12 biggest traded companies, on May 31, MSCI Inc. said
today in its semi-annual review. Vestas, based in the Danish
city of Aarhus, has lost 36 percent of its value this year,
after plunging 65 percent in 2011. The shares have slumped after
Vestas cut profit forecasts amid competition from Chinese
producers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
