State Bank of Mauritius Ltd. , the
country’s second-biggest lender by market value, rallied the
most in more than three years after announcing third-quarter
profit surged.  The  stock  advanced as much as 11 percent, the most since
March 2009 on an intraday basis, and traded 6.8 percent higher
to 86 rupees a share by 11:43 a.m. in Port Louis. A close at
this level would be the highest since October.  The city-based SBM, as the lender is known, announced after
the end of trading yesterday net income for the three months
through March jumped 40 percent to 625.1 million rupees ($21.2
million), according to a  statement  published on the Stock
Exchange of Mauritius website. The lender’s board of directors
agreed yesterday to split each SBM share into 100.  To contact the reporter on this story:
