(Corrects total amount of EFSF bonds sold since 2011 in
third paragraph of story originally published on May 9.)  Japan  purchased 4.6 percent of the
debt sold by the European Financial Stability Facility
yesterday, a Japanese Finance Ministry official said.  The nation bought 90 million euros ($117 million) of the
1.96 billion euros in three-month bills, the official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity because of the ministry’s
policy.  Japan has purchased about 11 percent of 45.4 billion euros
of EFSF bonds sold since January 2011, according to the
official.  Finance Minister  Jun Azumi  said yesterday that he wants
European governments to implement already planned steps to tame
the debt crisis. Last month Japan pledged $60 billion to the
 International Monetary Fund  to expand its resources to limit
risks from Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
