Corn rose for a third straight day
after the U.S. government reported sales to  China , the world’s
biggest hog producer, signaling increased demand for the grain
in livestock feed. Soybeans declined  U.S. exporters sold 900,000 metric tons of corn to China,
including 660,000 tons previously reported as sold to unknown
destinations, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said. Before
today, the grain fell 7.6 percent this year after the USDA said
farmers would harvest a record crop this year.  “The China corn-sale announcement is positive because it
shows they are willing to buy on weakness,” Jim Riley, a grain
broker for the Linn Group in Chicago, said today in a telephone
interview. “With a big crop on the horizon, we will need to see
more buying from China.”  Corn futures for July delivery climbed 0.3 percent to $5.99
a bushel at 10:05 a.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, after
rising 2.8 percent the past two sessions. Futures for December
delivery after the harvest slid 0.4 percent to $5.125.  Soybean futures for July delivery fell 0.5 percent to
$14.0625 a bushel on the CBOT. On May 14, the most-active
contract touched $13.76, the lowest since March 30. Futures for
delivery in November dropped 1 percent to $12.92.  The U.S. was the largest producer and exporter of both
commodities last year. Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at
$76.5 billion in 2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion,
government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
