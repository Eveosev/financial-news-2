New Zealand job advertisements fell 2
percent in April from March when they declined a revised 0.9
percent, ANZ National Bank Ltd.said in an e-mailed statement.  The decline was driven by a 3 percent drop in internet
listings offset by a 3.5 percent gain in newspaper advertising,
the Auckland-based lender said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
