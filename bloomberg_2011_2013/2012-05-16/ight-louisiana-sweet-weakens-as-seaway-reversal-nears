Light Louisiana Sweet oil weakened
for the fifth straight day, the longest losing streak of the
year, as buyers anticipate the arrival to the U.S. Gulf Coast of
similar, cheaper crude on the Seaway pipeline.  The premium of LLS against West Texas Intermediate oil
narrowed 40 cents to $12.35 a barrel at 4:09 p.m. on the  New
York  Mercantile Exchange, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The premium is the smallest since Jan. 31. The gap between
the two oils narrowed seven days in a row in December.  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  and  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  are
expected to start pumping crude south from Cushing,  Oklahoma , to
the Gulf Coast tomorrow, according to a filing with federal
regulators. A steep rise in Canadian and Midwest U.S. oil
production in recent years, combined with a lack of
transportation out of the Cushing storage hub, have created a
supply glut and low prices there.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet crude widened $2.25 to trade at a $16
premium to WTI. The premium for Mars Blend, a medium sour crude,
grew 75 cents to $11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
