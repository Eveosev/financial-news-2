Mickey Hatcher was fired as hitting
coach of the  Los Angeles Angels , who have scored the third-
fewest runs in the  American League  and gotten one home run in
146 at-bats from free-agent acquisition  Albert Pujols .  Hatcher, 57, was in his 13th season in the job under
manager Mike Scioscia.  The Angels are 16-21 this year and have been shut out eight
times, the most in Major League Baseball. They’re averaging 3.63
runs per game and Pujols is hitting .212 with 14 runs batted in
since joining the Angels in the offseason with a 10-year, $240
million contract.  “Sometimes in the sports world a point is reached where
perhaps a new voice is needed in order to attain the desired
goals and objectives,” Angels General Manager Jerry Dipoto said
in a statement. “Unfortunately we feel this is one of those
times. Offensively we have underachieved and everyone shares in
the responsibility of what has transpired thus far.”  Hatcher was replaced by Jim Eppard, who was hitting coach
at the Angels’ Triple-A affiliate in  Salt Lake City .  Pujols isn’t the only Angels’ hitter who’s struggled early
this season. Erick Aybar, who signed a four-year contract
extension last month, is batting .187 and lost his job as the
leadoff hitter, while Vernon Wells is hitting .242 with nine RBI
in 34 games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
