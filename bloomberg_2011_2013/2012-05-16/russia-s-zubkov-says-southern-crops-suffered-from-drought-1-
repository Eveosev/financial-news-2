Russia ’s southern crops were damaged
by drought in Krasnodar and some adjacent regions, the country’s
traditional breadbasket and main grain exporting area, said
 Viktor Zubkov , acting first deputy prime minister.  Soil moisture on fields decreased and plantings were
weakened after a lack of rain in the area for more than a month,
Zubkov said at a meeting in Moscow today, according to a
statement on the government’s website.  About 15 million hectares (37 million acres) of winter
grains survived out of 16.1 million hectares planted, Zubkov
said. The plants are in a “satisfactory” condition.  The  Agriculture Ministry ’s new crop estimate is for about
94 million metric tons of grains, little changed from last year.
The government isn’t expected to lower the target as farmers can
replant damaged areas, Zubkov said.  Russia’s Southern Federal district accounted for 24 percent
of the country’s total grain crop last year, after harvesting
almost 22.7 million tons of grain. Half of that crop was
harvested in Krasnodar region, according to state statistics
data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
