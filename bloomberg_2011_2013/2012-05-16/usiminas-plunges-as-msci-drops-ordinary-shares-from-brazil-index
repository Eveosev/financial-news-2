Ordinary shares of  Usinas
Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA , the second-largest Brazilian
steelmaker by output, fell to a three-year low after  MSCI Inc. (MSCI) 
said it was removing the stock from its Brazil Index.  The  shares  fell 7.3 percent to 14.31 reais at the close in
Sao Paulo, the lowest since April 2009. It was the second worst
performer on the benchmark Bovespa index, which dropped 0.6
percent.  Five Brazilian securities are going to be added to the
index as of the close of May 31, and five will be deleted,
including Usiminas’s ordinary shares, according to a statement
on MSCI’s website dated yesterday.  “This index is a very important portfolio reference for
foreign investors,”  Pedro Galdi , an analyst at SLW Corretora,
said by phone from Sao Paulo.  Preferred shares of Usiminas, the most-traded class of
stock, rose 1 percent to 10.05 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
