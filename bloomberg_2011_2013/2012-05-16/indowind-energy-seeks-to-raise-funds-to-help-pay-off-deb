Indowind Energy Ltd. (IEL) , which sells
wind power in  India  to companies including  Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  and
Citibank Inc., seeks to raise $30 million to help pay off loans
and bondholders.  The board has decided to try and raise the money through
external commercial borrowings to meet a “gap in funding,” the
company said today in a filing.  It needs $20 million “for clearing” long-term loans and
payments on its foreign-currency convertible bond, it said. The
remainder would go to building a 28-megawatt wind farm.  Chennai-based Indowind develops wind farms for sale and
also builds and operates its own installations. Its share price
has plunged 98 percent from its peak in 2007. It cited payment
delays by state-run electricity buyers and the lack of adequate
power distribution infrastructure in its latest  annual report .  It has $30 million of zero-coupon bonds that can be
converted into company stock maturing in December, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Its  shares  closed today at 5.1
rupees, 90 percent below the bond’s floor conversion price.  Shareholders approved changing the bond’s terms in August
2009 to lower the coupon to zero from 2.5 percent and the floor
conversion price to 48.9 rupees from 167.11 rupees, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg and company filings.  The  Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK)  filed a petition on
behalf of bondholders for payment of $40 million, Indowind said
in a March 9 filing to the National Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
