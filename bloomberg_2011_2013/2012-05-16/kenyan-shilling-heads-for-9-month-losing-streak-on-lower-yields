Kenya’s shilling slumped for the
seventh straight day, its longest losing streak in nine months,
as falling yields on  government securities  damps investors’
appetite.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy retreated as
much as 1 percent and traded 0.5 percent weaker at 84.30 per
dollar as at 2:35 p.m. in Nairobi. A close at that level would
be the longest run of losses since August.  “The falling yields on government securities have
undermined the shilling on reduced inflows form investors who
were targeting the higher yields hence propping the shilling,”
Raphael Agung, a dealer at Nairobi-based Commercial Bank of
Africa Ltd., said on phone.  Kenya’s three- and six-month borrowing costs fell for the
17th straight week after the government cut the size of its
weekly debt offering and halved its target for domestic debt
purchases in this financial year.  Kenya  has lowered its target for borrowing on the local
market to 62.1 billion shillings ($736.6 million) for the fiscal
year ending June 30, from a previous goal of 119.5 billion
shillings. The country will replace the local financing with a
$600 million syndicated loan arranged by Citigroup Inc.,  South
Africa ’s  Standard Bank Group Ltd. (SBK)  and London-based Standard
Chartered Plc, which was signed yesterday.  Treasury Yield  The yield on the 91-day Treasury bills declined to 11.381
percent at last week’s sale from a high of 20.799 percent at a
sale on Jan 12, while the yield on 182-day bills declined to
13.076 percent at a sale on May 9, from a high of 20.914 percent
realized on Jan 23, according to the Central bank  website . The
government has offered for sale 2 billion shillings of 6-months
treasury bills at today’s auction.  Kenya has offered 3 billion shillings in its one-week
repurchase agreements auction today, an official of the bank who
declined to be identified in line with policy said in a phone
interview from the capital today.  “The mop up action by the central bank is largely for
short term liquidity management hence not expected to prop up
the shilling,” Agung said.  Kenya’s government signed a $600 million two-year loan
accord with three foreign banks at 475 basis points above the
London interbank offered rate, Standard Bank Group Ltd. said.  “We expect the loan, which will be in foreign currency, to
assist in the stabilisation of the shilling and building up of
the foreign-currency reserves,” Njeru Githae, minister of
finance, said yesterday.  Tanzania’s shilling weakened 0.4 percent to 1,585 per
dollar, while the Ugandan shilling strengthened less than 0.1
percent to 2,488 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
