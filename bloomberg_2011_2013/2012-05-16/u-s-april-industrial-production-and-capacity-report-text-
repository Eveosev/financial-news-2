Following is the text of the U.S.
 Industrial Production  report for April:  Industrial production increased 1.1 percent in April.
Output is now reported to have fallen 0.6 percent in March and
to have moved up 0.4 percent in February; previously, industrial
production was estimated to have been unchanged in both months.
Manufacturing output increased 0.6 percent in April after having
decreased 0.5 percent in March.  Excluding motor vehicles and
parts, which increased nearly 4 percent, manufacturing output
moved up 0.3 percent, and output for all but a few major
industries increased.  Production at mines rose 1.6 percent, and
the output of utilities gained 4.5 percent after unseasonably
warm weather in the first quarter held down demand for heating.
At 97.4 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production
for April was 5.2 percent above its year-earlier level.  The
rate of  capacity utilization for total industry moved up to
79.2 percent, a rate 3.1 percentage points above its  level from
a year earlier but 1.1 percentage points below its long-run
(1972-2011) average.  Market Groups  The production of  consumer goods  increased 0.8 percent in
April.  The index for durable consumer goods rose 1.9 percent,
led by a gain of 2.4 percent in automotive products.  All other
major categories of  consumer durables  posted gains of more than
1 percent.  The production of nondurable consumer goods moved up
0.5 percent as a result of an increase of 2.5 percent in the
index for consumer energy products.  The output of non-energy
nondurable consumer goods edged down 0.1 percent as a small gain
in chemical products was more than offset by a decrease in foods
and tobacco.  The production of business equipment moved up 1.5 percent
in April after having risen 0.2 percent in March.  The more
rapid gain in April reflected improvement for all of the major
business equipment categories, particularly transit equipment,
which posted an increase of more than 3 percent for the third
month this year.  The index for defense and space equipment rose 0.3 percent
in April and was up 5.0 percent over the past 12 months.  The production of construction supplies was unchanged in
April after falling 1.6 percent in March; it remained more than
20 percent below its level preceding the recession.  The index
for business supplies advanced 1.4 percent for its largest
increase in more than 2 years.  The output of materials to be further processed in the
industrial sector rose 1.3 percent in April.  The index for
durable materials increased 1.0 percent after having decreased
0.5 percent in March; growth in this category averaged 1.4
percent per month for November through February.  Much of the
increase in durable materials in April came from consumer parts,
which advanced 2.7 percent and was boosted by an increase in the
output of motor vehicle parts for use in newly assembled
vehicles.  The production of equipment parts moved up 1.3
percent, and the index for other durable materials rose 0.3
percent.  The production of nondurable materials increased 0.3
percent, as all of its subcategories posted gains.  The output
index for energy materials jumped 2.2 percent after four
straight months of declines.  Industry Groups  Manufacturing output increased 0.6 percent in April after
having decreased 0.5 percent in March.  Capacity utilization for
manufacturing in April moved up 0.3 percentage point to 77.9
percent, a rate 14.1 percentage points above its trough in June
2009 but still 0.9 percentage point below its long-run average.  Within manufacturing, the output of durable goods increased
1.3 percent in April after having moved down 0.3 percent in
March.  With the exception of wood products, all major
categories of durable goods rose.  The largest gains were
recorded by motor vehicles and parts, computers and electronic
products, aerospace and miscellaneous transportation equipment,
furniture and related products, and miscellaneous manufacturing.  The production of nondurable goods decreased 0.2 percent in
April after having fallen 0.8 percent in March.  Among the major
components of nondurables, the most notable decrease in April
was for petroleum and coal products, which dropped 2.6 percent.
The largest gains were posted by the indexes for textile and
product mills, for apparel and leather, for paper, and for
printing and support.  The index for other manufacturing (non-NAICS), which
consists of publishing and logging, edged down 0.1 percent.  Mining production increased 1.6 percent in April after
having dropped 1.7 percent in March.  Capacity utilization in
mining moved up to 88.8 percent in April and was 1.5 percentage
points above its long-run average.  The output of utilities
jumped 4.5 percent after having fallen at an annual rate of
about 12 percent in each of the previous two quarters.  After
having been low from December through March, the operating rate
for utilities climbed in April to 76.4 percent, a rate about the
same as in November.  Capacity utilization rates in April at industries grouped
by stage of process were as follows:  At the  crude stage,
utilization increased 1 percentage point to 87.2 percent, a rate
0.9 percentage point above  its long-run average; at the primary
and semifinished stages, utilization increased 0.9 percentage
point to  76.5 percent, a rate 4.6 percentage points below its
long-run average; and at the finished stage,  utilization
increased 0.6 percentage point, to 78.8 percent, a rate 1.6
percentage points above its  long-run average.  Notice Revision of Industrial Production and Capacity
Utilization  The Federal Reserve Board issued its annual revision to the
index of industrial production (IP) and the related measures of
capacity utilization at noon EDT on March 30, 2012.  The revised
IP indexes incorporated detailed data from the 2010 Annual
Survey of Manufactures, conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau.
Annual data from the  U.S. Geological Survey  regarding metallic
and nonmetallic minerals (except fuels) for 2010 were also
incorporated.  The update included revisions to the monthly
indicator and to seasonal factors for each industry.  In
addition, the estimation methods for some series have changed.
Modifications to the methods for estimating the output of an
industry did affect the index from 1972 to the present.  Capacity and capacity utilization were revised to
incorporate data through the fourth quarter of 2011 from the
Census Bureau’s Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity, which covers
manufacturing, along with new data on capacity from the U.S.
Geological Survey, the  Department of Energy , and other
organizations.  The revision is available on the Board’s website at
www.federalreserve.gov/releases/G17.  Further information on the
revision can be obtained from the Board’s Industrial Output
Section (telephone number 202-452-3197).  References and Release Dates  References  The release for the annual revision that was published on
March 30, 2012 is available on the Board’s website (www.federal
reserve.gov/releases/g17/revisions/Current/DefaultRev.htm).  A
summary of the annual revision that incorporated back to 1972
production and capacity indexes reclassified according to the
North American  Industry Classification System is available in
an article in the  Federal Reserve Bulletin, vol. 89 (April
2003), pp. 151-176.  A description of the aggregation methods
for industrial production and capacity utilization is included
in an article in the Federal Reserve Bulletin, vol.  83
(February 1997), pp. 67-92.  The Federal Reserve methodology for
constructing industry-level measures of capital is detailed in
“Capital Stock Estimates for Manufacturing Industries: Methods
and Data” by Mike Mohr and Charles Gilbert (1996), which can be
obtained at:

description of the other methods used to compile the industrial
production index, plus a history of its development, a glossary
of terms, and a bibliography.  The major revisions to the IP
indexes and capacity utilization since 1990 have been described
