Obesity levels doubled in every
region of the world between 1980 and 2008, spurring rates of
non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and cancer that now
account for almost two in three deaths globally, the  World
Health Organization  said in a report.  About 500 million people are obese, the Geneva-based WHO
said in its annual World Health Statistics today. About 26
percent of adults in the Americas are obese, making it the
world’s fattest region, compared with 3 percent of adults in
 Southeast Asia , according to the report. Women are more likely
to be obese than men.  The WHO is working to develop voluntary targets for
reducing tobacco and alcohol use and improve diets to avert the
rising tide of diseases that aren’t passed from person to person
that a study last year said will cost the global economy $47
trillion over the next 20 years.  “This report is further evidence of the dramatic increase
in the conditions that trigger heart disease and other chronic
illnesses, particularly in low- and middle-income countries,”
Margaret Chan, the WHO’s director general, said in a statement.  About one in three adults worldwide has high  blood pressure 
and one in 10 has diabetes, the report said.  There was some good news. The number of maternal deaths has
been reduced by 47 percent to 290,000 in 2010 from 540,000 in
1990, and deaths of children under 5 years fell to 7.6 million
in 2010 from 10 million a decade earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
