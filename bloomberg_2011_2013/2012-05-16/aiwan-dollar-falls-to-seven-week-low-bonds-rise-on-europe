Taiwan ’s dollar dropped to the lowest
level in more than three months and  government bonds  rose as
concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is worsening deterred risk-taking.  The local currency fell for a fourth day as global funds
sold $398 million more of the island’s stocks than they bought,
taking net selling this month to $2.4 billion, according to
exchange data.  Greece  will hold fresh elections after President
Karolos Papoulias failed to form a coalition following an
inconclusive May 6 vote, threatening pledged spending cuts
required to secure 240 billion euros ($306 billion) in bailouts.  “Europe should continue to provide pessimism to the market
in the next month or so,” said  Albert Lee , a Taipei-based
fixed-income trader at Cathay United Bank Co. “We’re in an
environment that’s favorable for bonds.”  Taiwan’s dollar declined 0.4 percent to NT$29.635 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched
NT$29.637, the weakest level since Feb. 2. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings traders use to
price options, rose 72 basis points to 5.88 percent.  Taiwan will report on May 21 that export orders increased
0.02 percent in April from a year earlier after a 1.58 percent
drop in the previous month, according to the median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg survey.  The yield on the 1 percent notes due January 2017 dropped
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 0.961 percent,
according to Gretai Securities Market. It touched 0.950 percent
yesterday, the lowest level for  benchmark  five-year securities
since March 1.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little changed at
0.510 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center. It closed at 0.514 percent May 9
through May 11, the highest level since 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
