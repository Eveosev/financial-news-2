The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt rose, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments jumped 4.5 basis points to 299.5 at 10 a.m. in
 London , the highest for the series that started trading March
20. An increase signals worsening perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of swaps linked to 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings increased 21.5
basis points to 756.5. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125
companies with investment-grade ratings advanced for a seventh
day, climbing 6.5 basis points to 180.5. Both are the highest
since Jan. 9.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers rose seven basis points to 296 and the
subordinated index jumped 12 to 487.  Swaps on  Spain  soared as much as seven basis points to a
record 553, before trading unchanged at 546, while contracts on
 Italy  climbed 10 basis points to a four-month high of 512.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($12.7 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
