Dubai is targeting a price of $10 for
credits it hopes to earn from United Nations emissions offset
projects as markets recover, according to the chairman of the
government-sponsored Dubai Centre for Carbon Excellence.  “Although markets are suffering, this is perceived as a
short-term issue,” Waleed Salman said in an e-mailed response
to questions today. Long-term projections “foresee a doubling
of such a rate,” he said.  UN Certified Emission Reduction credits have lost 71
percent of their value in the past year. CERs for December
delivery closed unchanged at 3.64 euros ($4.63) a metric ton
yesterday on ICE Europe Futures in  London .  Dubai Electricity & Water Authority, the government-run
utility, is among local companies planning to amass credits
under the UN’s Clean Development Mechanism as the  United Arab
Emirates  tries to cut emissions. The U.A.E. is the world’s
third-biggest per-capita user of resources, after Qatar and
 Kuwait , WWF International said in its biennial Living Planet
report published yesterday.  Dubai is one of the U.A.E.’s seven constituent emirates.
All of its projects in the UN Framework Convention on Climate
Change’s pipeline could generate a maximum 588,000 CERs a year,
according to UNFCCC data compiled by Bloomberg. The CDM
generated 320 million CERs last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
