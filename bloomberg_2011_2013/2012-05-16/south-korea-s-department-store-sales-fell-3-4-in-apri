Sales at major South Korean
department stores fell the most in three months amid an outlook
for slowing growth and as Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis
reignited.  Outlays at the three biggest chains declined 3.4 percent
from a year earlier in April after a 1.6 percent gain in March,
the Ministry of  Knowledge Economy  said in a statement today.
 Discount-store sales  dropped 2.4 percent last month, today’s
report showed.  The Bank of  Korea  reduced its 2012 growth forecast for the
country to 3.5 percent from 3.7 percent on April 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
