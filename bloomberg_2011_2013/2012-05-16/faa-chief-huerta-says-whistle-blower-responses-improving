The  Federal Aviation Administration ,
said to have the highest rate of internal whistle-blowers among
U.S. agencies, is speeding up its investigations of complaints
and making needed safety improvements, its chief said.  FAA Acting Administrator Michael Huerta, in an interview
yesterday after a speech in Washington, responded for the first
time to allegations the agency ignored or took years to respond
to safety concerns raised by employees. Huerta pointed to the
agency’s creation in 2009 of a separate office to respond to
whistle-blower complaints.  “In that period of time, we’ve made tremendous strides in
responding to investigations that get referred to us,” Huerta
said.  The U.S. Office of Special Counsel, the agency charged with
protecting employees who seek protection for raising concerns
about fraud and abuse, said in letters on May 8 to the White
House and Congress that it had substantiated seven separate
whistle-blower complaints against the FAA.  Among them was that air-traffic controllers on  New York ’s
 Long Island  slept and watched movies on the job, and retaliated
against supervisors who tried to enforce safety rules, according
to agency  records  and Evan Seeley, a former center manager who
brought the complaint.  “Given the recurring and serious nature of these concerns,
I write with a strong recommendation that more rigorous
oversight measures be put in place” at the Transportation
Department and FAA, Special Counsel Carolyn Lerner said in her
letter.  Whistle-Blower Complaints  The FAA had the highest rate of substantiated whistle-
blower complaints among U.S agencies in a preliminary review,
Lerner wrote.  Huerta defended the agency’s recent responses to whistle-
blowers and didn’t directly address Lerner’s call for more
oversight.  All but four of the cases referred for investigation by the
special counsel in recent years have been closed, said Huerta,
whom President  Barack Obama  nominated as administrator on March
28.  “That’s four too many,” Huerta said. “We have to
continue to improve on that.”  The agency created its  Office of Audit and Evaluation  in
September 2009 after revelations from the special counsel and
congressional hearings that the FAA had ignored concerns raised
by two safety inspectors about  Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV)  being
allowed to skip mandated inspections.  Repeat Complaints  “This is a very, very high priority for us,” Huerta said.
“What I have instructed our team to do is to ensure that we are
being responsive and follow-up is quick.”  In four of the seven cases outlined in Lerner’s letter, FAA
employees had to bring complaints to the special counsel a
second time before safety issues were resolved, she said in a
press conference.  Some previous whistle-blower complaints were driven in part
by contentious relations between the agency and its unions,  Bill Voss , president of the Alexandria, Virginia-based Flight Safety
Foundation, said in a phone interview.  Another factor may be the tension between maintaining
safety and keeping the world’s busiest aviation system running
smoothly, he said.  “Every day they have to walk the line between being
efficient and being safe,” he said. “That’s not always a clear
line.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
