Investors led by  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) 
hired nine banks to underwrite more than 2 billion euros ($2.5
billion) of loans to back their acquisition of EON AG’s Open
Grid Europe distribution network, according to two people with
knowledge of the situation.  Bank of  Nova Scotia , BNP Paribas SA, Export Development
Canada, Commerzbank AG, Credit Agricole SA, ING Groep NV, Royal
Bank of Canada, Societe Generale SA, and UniCredit SpA
underwrote the financing that will amount to about 2.5 billion
euros when undrawn working capital and investment facilities are
included, said the people, who declined to be identified because
the deal is private.  Germany’s largest utility said today it agreed to sell the
network of natural-gas pipelines in the country to the
Macquarie-led group for 3.2 billion euros. EON said it expects
the deal, which requires approval from German authorities, to be
concluded in the third quarter.  The debt, which will have three and five-year tranches, has
been structured to support an investment-grade rating and may be
refinanced by bonds later, said the people.  Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, HSH Nordbank AG and SEB
AB have joined the underwriters for the financing, said the
people.  Karen Smith , a Macquarie spokeswoman in  London , declined to
comment.  Open Grid Europe operates about 12,000 kilometers (7,450
miles) of gas transmission pipes in Germany, according to its
website. Funds managed by Macquarie Infrastructure and Real
Assets completed the purchase of  RWE AG (RWE) ’s German gas grid unit
in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
