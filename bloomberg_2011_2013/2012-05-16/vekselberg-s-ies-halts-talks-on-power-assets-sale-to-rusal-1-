Billionaire  Viktor Vekselberg ’s IES
Holding ended talks on selling Russian power generating assets
to aluminum producer United Co. Rusal as its terms weren’t met.  The government last year supported Rusal’s purchase of
IES’s Bogoslovskaya power plant and Novobogoslovskaya project to
supply electricity to one of the aluminum company’s smelters in
the Urals region, IES said today in an e-mailed statement.  Rusal is “perplexed” by the statement, Arseniy Palagin, a
spokesman for the company controlled by Oleg Deripaska, said by
e-mail. The sale decision “was made with the participation of
the prime minister and can’t be overturned unilaterally.”  Vekselberg, a Rusal shareholder, quit as chairman of the
company in March over a dispute with Deripaska about strategy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
