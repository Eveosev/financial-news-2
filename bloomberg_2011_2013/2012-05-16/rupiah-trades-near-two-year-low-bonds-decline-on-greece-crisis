Indonesia ’s rupiah traded near a two-
year low and  government bonds  declined as the risk  Greece  will
leave the euro bolstered demand for dollars.  Overseas investors sold $279 million more Indonesian stocks
than they bought since the start of last week as Greek political
leaders, divided over austerity measures required for a European
Union-led bailout, failed to form a coalition government in the
wake of a May 6 election. The Dollar  Index (DXY) , a gauge of the
greenback’s strength, reached a four-month high before a two-day
holiday begins in Indonesia tomorrow.  “It’s still Greece,” said Apressyanti Senthaury, an
analyst in the treasury division at PT Bank Negara Indonesia.
“External factors are driving the rupiah, especially the
dollar’s position.”  The rupiah fell 0.4 percent this week to 9,280 per dollar
as of 9:28 a.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 9,314 yesterday, the weakest
level since May 2010, before strengthening 0.2 percent today.  One-month implied volatility, which measures exchange-rate
swings used to price options, rose 150 basis points this week to
9 percent, the highest level since March 12. The measure gained
100 basis points, or one percentage point, today.  The  yield  on the government’s benchmark 10-year bonds
climbed 24 basis points this week to 6.49 percent, the highest
since November, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It rose six
basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
