The  Asian Development Bank  sold $339
million in clean-energy bonds to fund renewable and efficiency
projects to secure power supplies for Asia’s growing economies.  Nomura International Plc, a unit of Japan’s  Nomura Holdings
Inc. (8604) , arranged the sale and the bonds were placed with Japanese
retail investors, the Manila-based Asian Development Bank said
today in a website  statement .  The ADB was the third-biggest issuer of green bonds at the
end of 2011 with $897 million after the  World Bank  and European
Investment Bank, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The
International Finance Corp. sold its first green bonds in the
U.S. market to raise $500 million for climate projects in
 emerging markets , the  World Bank unit  said in April.  “ Asia  needs to meet its growing energy needs in ways that
don’t pollute the air we breathe or water we drink,” Mikio
Kashiwagi, ADB treasurer, said in the statement. “To do that,
there needs to be more investment in clean-energy projects”.  The bonds, often called green, climate or clean-energy
bonds, can be issued by the leading development banks to fund
air, water and energy projects that help fight climate change
and people affected by it.  The ADB raised A$15.3 million ($15.2 million), 147 million
Brazilian real ($73.4 million) and 452 million Turkish liras
($247 million) through the sale, according to the statement. The
transaction was its second clean-energy bond sale to Japanese
retail investors.  The bank, formed in 1966 to improve the welfare of people
in Asia and the Pacific, invested $2.1 billion in clean-energy
projects last year, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
