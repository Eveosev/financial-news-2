A central Turkish province started
fining people for public consumption and sale of alcohol, saying
drinking in open spaces and vehicles is causing unwanted
situations, Milliyet  reported .  Authorities in Afyonkarahisar penalized 25 people on May 13,
when the rule went into effect, fining them each 169 liras ($93),
according to the Istanbul-based newspaper.  Governor Irfan Balkanlioglu canceled a provision blocking
alcohol consumption in picnic areas after a public outcry,
Milliyet said. Establishments with licenses can still serve
alcohol and itâ€™s not forbidden to drink indoors, according to
the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
