Argentina is extending government
oversight of  YPF SA (YPF)  after seizing control of the oil producer
last month in a dispute over investments and dividend payments.  Planning Minister Julio de Vido and Deputy Economy Minister
Axel Kicillof will remain in charge for a further 30 days after
the April 16 seizure, according to the official gazette today.  Repsol YPF SA (REP)  took legal action this week against Argentina
to pursue damages from the takeover of its controlling stake in
YPF announced by President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  last
month. Her government has refuted Repsol’s claims for $10.5
billion in compensation, saying it failed to spend enough on
production and reserves at Argentina’s largest oil company.  Repsol said last month it invested more than $20 billion in
the unit since 1999. The Spanish company this week notified
Argentine officials of its intention to file a claim with the
World Bank’s International Center for the Settlement of
Investment Disputes in Washington, joining other companies and
 hedge funds  seeking payouts from the nation.  YPF American Depositary Receipts slid 14 percent to $12.16
at 1:20 p.m. in  New York . Repsol slid 1.3 percent to 13.44 euros
in Madrid.  Argentine oil output declined to 35.3 million cubic meters
in 2010, from 45.4 million in 2001, according to data published
by the Argentina Oil and Gas Institute. YPF produces about 34
percent of the country’s crude.  To contact the reporters on this story:
