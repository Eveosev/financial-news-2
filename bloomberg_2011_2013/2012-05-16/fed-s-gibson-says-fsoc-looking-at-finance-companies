U.S. financial regulators are looking
at specific non-bank financial companies to possibly designate
them as systemically important and subject to more rigorous
supervision, said  Michael Gibson , director of the Division of
Banking Supervision and Regulation at the Federal Reserve Board.  The Financial Stability Oversight Council issued a rule
April 3 explaining the criteria it will use to designate non-
bank financial firms as systemically important. Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  is a member of the council and U.S.
Treasury Secretary  Timothy Geithner  chairs the panel.  “The Council and its member agencies’ staffs currently are
using these criteria to analyze the potential systemic
importance of individual non-bank financial companies in
different industries,” Gibson said in prepared testimony to a
House Financial Services subcommittee today.  Fed officials have stepped up their oversight of financial
system risk following the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Once the
panel, known as FSOC, designates a financial company as
systemically important, the Dodd Frank Act entrusts the Fed with
supervision of the institution.  “The  Federal Reserve  is committed to thoroughly assessing
the business model, capital structure, and risk profile of each
designated company,” Gibson told the subcommittee in the text
of his remarks.  Gibson became division director on Jan. 1 this year,
succeeding  Patrick Parkinson . He did not mention JPMorgan Chase
& Co.’s recent trading loss in the prepared text.  To contact the reporter on this story:
