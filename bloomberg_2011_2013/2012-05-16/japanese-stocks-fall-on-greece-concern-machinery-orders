     May 16 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  stocks  fell, with the Topix
Index declining a sixth day, as  Greece  moved to hold another
election after failing to form a new government, intensifying
concern the debt-stricken nation will exit the euro. Shares also
declined on a report Japanese machinery orders slumped in March.  Konica Minolta Holdings Inc. (4902) , a maker of photo films that
gets 28 percent of its sales in  Europe , lost 3.9 percent.
 Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , Japan’s largest construction machinery maker, fell
2.5 percent.  Nichii Gakkan (9792)  Co., a provider of hospital
administration services, slumped 12 percent after its operating
profit forecast missed estimates.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  lost 1.1 percent to 8,801.17
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo. Trading volume was 14 percent
below the 30-day average. The broader Topix fell 1.1 percent to
738.88, with about four shares dropping for each that rose.  “ Risk aversion  is rising, making it hard for investors to
make a move through June while monitoring Greek political
developments,” said Hitoshi Asaoka, a Tokyo-based senior
strategist at Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., a unit of Japan’s
third-largest bank by market value. “Cyclical stocks sensitive
to risk sentiment are leading losses.”  The Nikkei 225 has retreated 14 percent from this year’s
high on March 27 as China’s economic growth slowed and on
renewed concern about Europe’s debt crisis. The drop has brought
the value of stocks on the Topix to 0.88 times book value,
compared with 2.11 for the S&P 500 and 1.35 for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index. A value less than one means investors can buy
companies for less than the value of their assets.  Greek Election  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  fell 0.4 percent
today. The gauge slid 0.6 percent in  New York  yesterday as
Greece announced it will return to the polls after President
Karolos Papoulias failed to broker a governing coalition.
Resistance to austerity measures has led to political gridlock
that threatens 240 billion euros ($305 billion) of aid and an
exit from the monetary union.  “If Greece -- and this is the will of the great majority -
- wants to stay in the euro, then they have to accept the
conditions,” German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  told
reporters at a meeting of European finance ministers in Brussels.
“Otherwise it isn’t possible. No responsible candidate can hide
that from the electorate.”  Companies that rely on Europe fell.  Konica Minolta  slid 3.9
percent to 596 yen.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that gets 31
percent of its sales in the region, slid 1 percent to 3,375 yen.  Industrial shares also dropped on a government report today
that showed Japan’s machinery orders dropped 2.8 percent in
March after rising by the same amount in February. Komatsu lost
2.5 percent to 1,959 yen.  Daikin Industries Ltd. (6367) , which
manufactures air-conditioning equipment, slid 1.5 percent to
2,020 yen.  Profit Forecasts  Nichii Gakkan slumped 12 percent to 883 yen after
forecasting 11.4 billion yen ($142 million) in operating profit
for the year ending March 31, lower than 13.1 billion yen
estimated by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Three Japanese companies slid today after an announcement
they would be delisted from the MSCI Japan Index at the end of
this month. Hiroshima Bank Ltd. lost 9.1 percent to 280 yen, the
lowest since 1997. Hokuhoku Financial Group Inc. dropped 9.1
percent to an all-time low 120 yen. Nippon Sheet Glass Co. fell
3.2 percent to 90 yen, its lowest level on record.  Among stocks that advanced,  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) ,
Japan’s third-largest lender by market value, gained 1.8 percent
to 116 yen. Mizuho said net income will climb 3.2 percent to 500
billion yen in the year ending March, beating the 378 billion
yen average estimate of analysts polled by Bloomberg.  Of the 1,463 companies on the Topix that have posted
quarterly results since April 10, 279 exceeded expectations,
while 207 missed analysts’ estimates, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg News.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  added 9.4 percent to 24.21,
the highest since Dec. 9, indicating traders expect a swing of
6.9 percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
