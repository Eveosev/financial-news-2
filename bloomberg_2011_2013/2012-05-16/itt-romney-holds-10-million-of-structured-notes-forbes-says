Republican presidential candidate
 Mitt Romney  owns about $10 million of structured notes, Forbes
reported today.  The former governor of Massachusetts bought products issued
by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and  BNP Paribas SA (BNP) , Forbes said,
citing Romney’s filings with the U.S. Office of Government
Ethics and discussions with Romney officials that it didn’t
name.  Romney’s net wealth, which is estimated at $230 million,
also includes other debt securities, an investment in a hedge
fund and profits from the funds of private equity firm Bain
Capital LLC, Forbes reported.  Romney’s campaign spokeswoman Andrea Saul didn’t respond to
an e-mail requesting comment.  Structured notes are securities created by banks, which
package debt with derivatives to offer customized bets to
investors while earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are
contracts whose value is derived from stocks, bonds, currencies
and commodities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
