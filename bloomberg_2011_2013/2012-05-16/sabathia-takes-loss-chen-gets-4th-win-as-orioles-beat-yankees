Rookie pitcher Wei-Yin Chen won his
fourth game and Jim Johnson picked up his 12th save as the host
Baltimore Orioles beat the  New York  Yankees 5-2.  CC Sabathia (5-1) took the loss, allowing four runs on
eight hits in six innings while striking out six.  Chen (4-0) allowed two runs on four hits and struck out
four in seven innings at Oriole Park at Camden Yards last night.
Johnson has converted 20 consecutive saves going back to last
season for the longest active streak in  Major League Baseball .  The teams split their two-game series in Baltimore, with
the Yankees winning the opener 8-5.  Adam Jones  gave the Orioles the lead with a solo home run
in the second inning. Steve Tolleson scored in the third when
J.J. Hardy grounded into a double play. Xavier Avery scored on
Hardy’s double in the fifth and Bill Hall added a run on Hardy’s
infield single in the sixth to make it 4-0.  Curtis Granderson  hit a two-run homer in the seventh for
the Yankees’ only runs.  The Orioles’ final run scored on a passed ball by New York
catcher Chris Stewart.  To contact the reporter on this story:
