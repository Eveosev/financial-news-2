Delta Real Estate , a member of
Belgrade-based  Delta Holding , plans to build the biggest
shopping mall in the country.  Construction of the 200,000-square-meter (2.15 million
square feet) Delta Planet mall in the capital will begin in the
spring of 2013 and will cost 200 million euros ($254 million),
said general manager Vojislav Glavinic. It will be completed by
the end of 2014, with more than 250 retail units, a parking lot,
spas and cinemas, he said.  About 70 percent of the financing will be arranged with
domestic and foreign banks, while the rest will come from
Delta’s own assets, said Jelena Krstovic, the vice president of
the privately-held holding company.  Delta, which last year sold the Delta Maxi supermarket
chain to  Delhaize Group SA (DELB)  for 932.5 million euros, also has
mid-term plans to build another mall in Belgrade and one in
Banja Luka in neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina, Krstovic said.  Delta Planet will be the holding’s third such venture after
developing the 85,000-square-meter Delta City in Belgrade and a
similar one in Podgorica, the capital of  Montenegro .  To contact the reporter on this story:
