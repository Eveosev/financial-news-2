Anglo American Plc (AAL)  so far approved
capital expenditure of $5 billion for next year and $3.5 billion
for 2014, Chief Executive Officer  Cynthia Carroll  said.  Anglo, based in  London , may more than double 2014 capex as
new projects are added, Carroll said, according to a copy of a
 presentation  at a Miami conference posted on its website. The
company has about $100 billion of approved and unapproved
projects including iron-ore, coal, copper and niobium.  Anglo, with $7 billion of capex planned this year, “can
choose to accelerate the development of the highest returning,
lowest risk projects in the most attractive commodities for all
stages of the economic cycle,” the company said today in an e-
mailed response to questions. Capital expenditure is used to
maintain current operations and build new projects.  Anglo plans to increase output by more than 50 percent by
the end of 2014 as it bets demand for the commodities it
produces will be buoyed by Asian economic expansion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
