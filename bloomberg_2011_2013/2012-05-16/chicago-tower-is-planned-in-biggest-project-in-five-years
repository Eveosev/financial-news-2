Hines, an international property
investor, and the real estate arm of  Canada ’s biggest pension-
fund manager plan to build a $300 million  office tower  in
 Chicago , the largest new project in the city in five years.  The proposed 45-story building, known as River Point, will
be constructed downtown on the western bank of the Chicago River
at Lake Street, Ivanhoe Cambridge, the Montreal-based real
estate operation of Caisse de Depot et Placement du  Quebec , and
Houston-based Hines said today in a statement. The project will
have 900,000 square feet (84,000 square meters) of space and is
scheduled for completion in 2016, the companies said.  River Point, which doesn’t have any tenants signed, will be
Chicago’s biggest real estate project started in the past five
years, Mayor  Rahm Emanuel  said in the statement. Demand for
downtown office space is rising as the local economy recovers.
The office vacancy rate fell to 15.1 percent in the first
quarter from 16.4 percent a year earlier, brokerage Cushman &
Wakefield Inc. said.  “There’s a little more optimism about the downtown area
over the last year,” James Kutill, a vice president of Chicago-
based Appraisal Research Counselors, said in a telephone
interview. “Definitely more than the suburban markets.”  Construction is slated to begin this year, and several
corporations have expressed interest in leasing space at the
tower, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
