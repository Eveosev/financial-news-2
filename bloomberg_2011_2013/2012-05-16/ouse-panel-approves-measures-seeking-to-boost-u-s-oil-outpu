The House Natural Resources Committee
approved legislation aimed at increasing oil production on U.S.
federal lands.  The bills approved today would require the Interior
Department to set goals for oil and natural-gas production on
federal property and set a minimum acreage requirement for lease
sales.  The bills are H.R. 4381 and H.R. 4382. The Senate hasnâ€™t
taken up similar legislation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
