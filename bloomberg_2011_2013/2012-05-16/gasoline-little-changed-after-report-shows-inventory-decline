Gasoline futures were little changed
after the Energy Department reported stockpiles of the motor
fuel declined last week.  Gasoline supplies sank 2.8 million barrels to 204.3 million
in the seven days ended May 11, according to department data.
The median estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg called
for a 100,000-barrel decrease.  June-delivery gasoline slipped 0.11 cent to $2.943 a gallon
at 10:36 a.m. on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange. Prices were
$2.9417 before the reportâ€™s release at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  The government said heating oil and diesel  inventories  fell
969,000 barrels to 119.8 million in the week ended May 11.
Analysts forecast a 150,000-barrel increase, according to the
survey.  Heating oil for June delivery dropped 0.39 cent to $2.9291
a gallon, from $2.9316 before the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
