Chow Tai Fook (1929)  Jewellery Group Ltd.,
which makes more than half of its sales from gold products,
plunged to a record low in Hong Kong trading as the precious
metal entered a so-called bear market.  The stock  dropped  9.6 percent, the most since its Dec. 15
debut, to close at HK$10.54, leading declines among jewelers.
 Tse Sui Luen Jewellery International Ltd. (417)  fell 5.7 percent,  Chow
Sang Sang Holdings International Ltd. (116)  lost 4.3 percent and  Luk
Fook Holdings International Ltd. (590)  slid 3.9 percent.  Immediate-delivery gold has lost more than 20 percent from
its all-time high last September after Greek leaders failed to
form a government. Chow Tai Fook may face slower growth amid
gold’s slump and weaker economic expansion in  China , said Castor Pang, head of research at Core-Pacific Yamaichi International
Ltd.  “Chow Tai Fook’s profit is very sensitive to sales of gold
products,” Pang said in a phone interview today. “It may not
be able to maintain the high growth it had last year.”  The company’s  profit  for the year ended March 2011 jumped
65 percent to HK$3.5 billion ($450 million) from a year earlier,
according to its listing document. The company expects to post
net income of at least HK$6.3 billion for the 12 months ended
March 31, it said.  Salary Cut  China, the world’s second-largest gold jewelry market, on
May 12 lowered banks’  reserve requirements  for the third time in
six months.  Gross domestic product  of China expanded 8.1 percent in the
first three months of 2012 from a year earlier in the fifth
straight quarterly deceleration.  Chow Tai Fook, which has more than 1,500 watch and jewelry
outlets in 320 cities in China as well as in  Hong Kong  and
Macau, plans to open as many as 200 jewelry sales points a year
through 2015, Alan Chan, the Hong Kong-based jeweler’s director
of group branding, said in a March interview.  The world’s largest listed jewelry retailer last week
canceled back-office staff’s guaranteed bonus, equivalent to at
least 3 months’ salary, starting this month,  Apple Daily 
reported today, citing unidentified people. Chow Tai Fook
couldn’t be reached to comment on the report.  The change may reduce the employees’ pay by 30 percent to
50 percent, according to the Hong Kong-based Chinese newspaper.  Chow Tai Fook’s  stock  has lost 24 percent since the
beginning of the year, compared with a 4.5 percent gain in the
 Hang Seng Index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
