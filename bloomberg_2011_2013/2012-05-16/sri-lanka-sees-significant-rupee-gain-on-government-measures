Sri Lanka ’s rupee will appreciate
significantly and the central bank is ready to intervene to
prevent “unnecessary” movement in the currency, Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal said.  “We expect the rupee to significantly appreciate from the
current levels due to a very clear path that will be seen in our
external account,” Cabraal said in an interview in Nepal
yesterday. “If we believe that it is trading at levels not in
line with fundamentals we stand ready to deal with any
unnecessary movement.” He was attending a meeting of South
Asian central bank officials.  The Central Bank of Sri Lanka held  interest rates  last week
after implementing an economic policy overhaul this year to damp
import demand, narrow the  trade gap  and protect foreign
reserves. The rupee has rebounded 2.7 percent since falling to
133.10 per dollar on April 25, a record low.  The rupee gained 0.1 percent to 128.9 per dollar yesterday,
while the  Colombo All-Share Index (CSEALL)  of stocks rose 1.7 percent.  Borrowing costs are at appropriate levels and the nation
doesn’t need to take further steps on interest rates, Cabraal
said. The central bank’s  reverse repurchase  rate is 9.75 percent
and the  repurchase rate  is 7.75 percent.  The central bank raised borrowing costs twice this year and
moved to a more freely floating exchange rate in addition to
increasing fuel prices to damp oil imports.  To contact the reporters on this story:
