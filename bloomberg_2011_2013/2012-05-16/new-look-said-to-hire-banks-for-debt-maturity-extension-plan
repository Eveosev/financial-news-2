New Look Group Ltd., the closely held
U.K. discount-fashion retailer, hired HSBC Holdings Plc and
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc to coordinate plans to extend
its debt maturity, according to two people with knowledge of the
matter.  The company may seek lender approval to extend the maturity
of its term loan B and term loan C by about 15 to 18 months and
the second-lien loans by three months to April 2015, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the talks are
private.  New Look may offer to increase the interest margin on B and
C tranches to about 475 basis points, said the people. The
company is also considering extending the maturity of its
revolving credit, the people said. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  The company doesn’t plan to change the covenants of its
debt, the people said.  New Look may also offer to prepay 75 million pounds of
cash-pay debt at par, and an additional 25 million pounds would
be earmarked to buy back payment-in-kind debt at a discount if
the London-based retailer reduces borrowings to two times
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
from 2.6 times currently, the people said.  An offial in  London  for New Look, who wouldn’t be
indentified, declined to comment.  New Look said on Jan. 12 that sales for the five weeks to
Dec. 31 were up 3.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
