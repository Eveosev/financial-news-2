Michael Warren, chief technology
officer at the London Metal Exchange, has died, the bourse said
in a notice to members today.  Martin Abbott , chief executive officer, said Warren was the
first person he hired at the LME. “He was instrumental in the
development of the LME over the last five years having
transformed the business from being a technological under-
performer into a first class exchange, easily matching our peer
group in terms of capacity and resilience,” Abbott said.  Warren, 56, had more than 30 years of experience in
 information technology , having started his career at IBM Inc. in
 New Zealand  in 1974, according to the LME. He worked as director
in the technology risk practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
and was owner of his own company specializing in risk
management, IT and strategic consulting before joining the LME
in 2007.  Warren oversaw initiatives such as upgrading the LME’s
electronic trading system and introducing so-called proximity
hosting, which allows members and clients to locate their
trading systems close to the exchange’s data center to speed up
orders. The bourse handled $15.4 trillion worth of contracts
last year, a 33 percent increase from 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
