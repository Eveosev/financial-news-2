ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA) ’s steel plant in
 Brazil  may be of interest to South Korea’s  Posco (005490)  or  Vale SA (VALE3) ,
which already owns 27 percent of it,  Handelsblatt  reported,
citing an interview with Heinrich Hiesinger, ThyssenKrupp’s
chief executive officer.  Posco wants to expand in Brazil, the newspaper said.  ThyssenKrupp said yesterday that a sale of U.S. and
Brazilian plants is among “strategic options” for its
unprofitable Americas unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
