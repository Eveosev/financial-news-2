Nigeria ’s naira retreated to three-
month low against the dollar on bets that a rising inflation
rate and a decline in oil prices would weigh on its value.  The currency of  Africa ’s largest oil producer declined 0.4
percent to 158.90 per dollar as of 3:20 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, its weakest on a closing basis since Feb.
14, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Inflation accelerated to 12.9 percent in April, the fastest
since October 2010, from 12.1 percent in March, the  National
Bureau of Statistics  said yesterday. West Texas Intermediate
crude fell as much as 2.3 percent to $91.81 per barrel today,
its lowest this year. Nigeria depends on crude exports for more
than 95 percent of its foreign income.  “With average monthly  oil prices  sliding towards $90 per
barrel as other exogenous risks such as an Iran strike die down,
Nigeria remains particularly vulnerable to an oncoming oil price
shock,” Sebastian Spio-Garbrah, head of New York-based DaMina
Advisors LLP, a frontier-market risk adviser, said in an e-
mailed note today. Declining oil prices expose “the naira to
further depreciation of another 5 to 10 percent, implying a
dollar versus naira rate of between 163 to a dollar and 166 to a
dollar in coming months.”  Nigeria raised its  policy rate  to a record 12 percent in
October to curb inflation and stabilize the local currency. The
 Central Bank of Nigeria  forecast inflation will peak at 14.5
percent in the third quarter before gradually slowing to below
10 percent by the end of 2013.  The inflation rate will put the naira under pressure of
depreciation,  Bismarck Rewane , chief executive officer of Lagos-
based Financial Derivatives Co., said yesterday.  Currency Auction  Nigeria sold $200 million at a foreign-currency auction
today, with lenders buying the entire amount on sale, the Abuja-
based central bank said today in an e-mailed statement.  The marginal rate, which is also used as the prevailing
exchange rate, was 155.70 naira, unchanged from the previous
auction on May 14.  Yields on Nigeria’s Eurobonds due 2021 rose nine basis
points to 5.591 percent in  London .  Borrowing costs on domestic bonds due 2015 gained 19 basis
points to 15.22 percent as of May 15, according to data on the
Financial Markets Dealers Association website.  Ghana ’s cedi was unchanged at 1.9050 per dollar as of 3:15
p.m. in the capital, Accra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
