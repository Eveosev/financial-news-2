Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP raised its count
of layoffs of non-union workers at its Manhattan building by
100, to 533, according to a notice on the  New York  State
Department of Labor website.  The New York-based law firm today amended a May 8  notice 
under the so-called WARN rule for plant closings, or Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, giving the number of
employees in the building as 533, and the number affected as
433. The layoff date was yesterday. No date was given for when
the firm will clear out of the building, where fewer than 50
people remain, a security guard estimated today.  Dewey, once the 11th-largest U.S. law firm, is collecting
bills to pay lenders owed $200 million or more, according to a
person familiar with the situation. The firm has lost more than
two thirds of its 300 partners, according to American Lawyer.
The notice of layoffs cited economic dislocation.  Patrizia DeGennaro, the Dewey contact listed on the notice,
didnâ€™t immediately return a phone call seeking comment on the
layoffs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
