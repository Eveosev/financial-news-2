million as of March 31, and 3.2 million shares of Atlanta-based

resignation of senior managers and prompted Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon to say the investments were “flawed,
complex, poorly reviewed, poorly executed and poorly
monitored.”  Soros also purchased 3.75 million shares of Sugar Land,
Texas-based  CVR Energy Inc. (CVI)  valued at $100 million as of March
31. On May 7, billionaire  Carl Icahn  won the right to acquire

sell their stakes to him for $30 a share. The shares have
climbed 62 percent this year.  Google Sale  The firm sold 260,000 shares of Mountain View, California-

billion from $4.18 billion at the end of 2011, according to the
filing.  Michael Vachon, a spokesman for Soros, declined to comment.  Money managers who oversee more than $100 million in U.S.
