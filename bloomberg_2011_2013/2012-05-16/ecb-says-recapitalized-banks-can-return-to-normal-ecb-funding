The  European Central Bank  said it’s
willing to allow Greek banks needing recapitalization to return
to its normal lending operations once that process has been
completed.  The ECB said it expects recapitalization to be finalized
“soon,” according to an emailed statement today. Until then,
banks that are “severely undercapitalized” after this year’s
restructuring of Greek government debt will have to tap the
Emergency Liquidity Assistance program provided by the Greek
central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
