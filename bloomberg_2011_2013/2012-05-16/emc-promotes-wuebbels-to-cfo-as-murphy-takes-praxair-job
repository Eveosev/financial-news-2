MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. (WFR) , the
second-largest U.S. maker of polysilicon, promoted Brian
Wuebbels to chief financial officer, replacing Mark Murphy, who
resigned today to take a job at Praxair Inc.  Wuebbels was previously a vice president at MEMC, where
heâ€™s worked since 2007, the St. Peters, Missouri-based company
said in statement today. Murphy will consult with MEMC during
the transition.  Shares of MEMC fell 7.8 percent to $2.13 at the close in
New York, the lowest since November 2001. The company reported a
first-quarter loss May 9 that was 20 times greater than a year
earlier as sales fell at its solar energy unit.  Praxair, based in Danbury, Connecticut, produces and sells
gases including oxygen and helium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
