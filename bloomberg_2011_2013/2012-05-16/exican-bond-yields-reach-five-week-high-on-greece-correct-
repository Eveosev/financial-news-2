(Corrects peso prices in fifth paragraph.)  Mexican bond yields touched a five-
week high as  Greece ’s political leaders failed to form a new
government, damping demand for the Latin American nation’s
higher-yielding assets.  The yield on Mexican local-currency bonds due in 2024 was
6.391 percent at 4 p.m. in Mexico City. It’s the highest closing
level since April 6. The price fell 0.01 centavo to 131.12
centavos per peso.  “There’s been a strong  risk aversion  in international
markets,” Alejandro Padilla, a debt strategist at Grupo
Financiero Banorte-Ixe, said in a telephone interview from
Mexico City. “Mexico doesn’t find itself in a situation like
the majority of the countries in Europe, including many
developed and emerging-market nations. However, clearly
investors are seeing all  emerging markets  as risky assets.”  Investors have pared demand for longer-term, fixed-rate
Mexican denominated bonds over the past week, with yields rising
17 basis points, amid deepening concern that Europe’s financial
woes are worsening. Greece will hold new elections after
President Karolos Papoulias failed to broker the creation of a
government following an inconclusive May 6 vote, Pasok leader
 Evangelos Venizelos  said today.  The peso slid 0.7 percent to 13.8363 per  U.S. dollar , from
13.7344 yesterday. It earlier touched 13.8431, the weakest level
since Jan. 3.  Mexico sold all 7 billion pesos ($506 million) of 28-day
Cetes and 8 billion pesos of the 91-day securities it offered
today, the central bank said on its website. Mexico also sold
all 8.5 billion pesos of the 182-day bills it auctioned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
