Glasgow Rangers had its appeal
against a yearlong transfer embargo and 160,000-pound ($255,000)
fine rejected by a Scottish Football Association tribunal.  The governing body had charged the club with six breaches
of its rules and banned previous owner  Craig Whyte  from Scottish
soccer. Rangers argued that the club shouldn’t be held
responsible for Whyte’s actions.  The tribunal will give full reasons in writing for
rejecting the appeal “in early course,” the  SFA said  in a
statement late yesterday. Duff and Phelps, the company running
the club while it’s in administration, a form of bankruptcy,
said in a statement that the 54-time Scottish champion intends
to challenge the tribunal’s ruling.  Duff and Phelps said four days ago that it had accepted an
offer to purchase the club from a group led by former Sheffield
United Chief Executive Officer Charles Green. The group has
secured a period of exclusivity to complete the purchase, which
should happen at a meeting of creditors on June 6.  “Our group went into the purchase of the club with this
sanction in place but we hoped the decision would at least be
commuted,” Green said in a  statement  last night on Rangers’
website. “We fully support the club as it considers an appeal
against this latest decision.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
