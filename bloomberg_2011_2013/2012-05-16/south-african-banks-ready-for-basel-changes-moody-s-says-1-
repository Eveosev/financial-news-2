South Africa ’s  banks  are well-
capitalized and prepared for Basel III regulations, according to
Moody’s Investors Service.  The quality of the lenders’ assets remains an “issue” for
Moody’s, analyst Nondas Nicolaides said in a presentation in
Johannesburg today. Bad debts may rise when  interest rates 
increase, and the bulk of non-performing loans are mortgages, he
said.  Basel III international rules will come into effect over
the next six years, requiring banks to hold enough capital to
survive market turmoil without causing risk to the financial
system. Moody’s downgraded credit ratings on South Africa’s five
largest banks in February, citing “the country’s increasingly
constrained public finances,” which may mean the state would
find it difficult to extend support to the banking system if
needed.  The growth of unsecured lending in South Africa doesn’t
pose a “systemic” risk, Nicolaides said. That South Africa is
monitoring unsecured lending is “positive,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
