Tunisia’s grain stocks are enough to
meet local market needs for two months, and the country’s crop
is expected to increase over the summer, the head of the
state grain office said.  “The preliminary estimates of the grain crop are still not
clear, but it may exceed 2.5 million metric tons this year
compared to 2.3 million tons last year,” Omar Chouchen
said in a telephone interview yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
