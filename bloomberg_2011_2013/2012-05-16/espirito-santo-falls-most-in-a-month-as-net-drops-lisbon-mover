Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES) , Portugal’s
biggest publicly traded bank, fell the most in a month in Lisbon
trading after reporting lower quarterly profit.  The stock dropped as much as 5 euro cents, or 8.6 percent,
to 53 cents, the biggest  intraday  decline since April 12.
Espirito Santo traded at 53.8 cents as of 2:11 p.m. in the
Portuguese capital, which would be the lowest close since 1993.  Espirito Santo, which is based in Lisbon, said yesterday
after the close of trading that first-quarter  net income  dropped
84 percent to 11.6 million euros ($15 million).  “These earnings consolidate the trend of accentuated
deterioration of the quality of the bank’s assets, in line with
the sector in  Portugal , and with the level of provisioning
remaining high,” Andre Rodrigues, an analyst at Caixa-Banco de
Investimento SA, said today in a research note. Rodrigues has a
buy recommendation on the stock.  Espirito Santo last week completed a 1 billion-euro  capital 
increase. That share sale will increase the bank’s core Tier 1
ratio, a measure of financial strength, to 10.75 percent from
9.21 percent, the lender said on April 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
