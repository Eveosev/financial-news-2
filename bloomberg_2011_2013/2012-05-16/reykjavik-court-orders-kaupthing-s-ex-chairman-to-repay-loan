Reykjavik’s District Court ruled that
 Kaupthing Bank hf ’s former Chairman Sigurdur Einarsson was
personally liable for a part of a loan he received from the
failed lender.  Einarsson was found liable for 496 million kronur ($3.9
million) of the total 3.6 billion kronur he borrowed, according
to the  ruling . The court upheld a freeze on his assets pending
an appeal to the  Supreme Court .  Kaupthing’s board in a letter dated Sept. 28, 2008, had
sought to revoke personal liability on loans given to a number
of executives in connection with stock purchases after share
prices declined. Kaupthing collapsed in October that year after
it was unable to secure the short-term funding.  The bank’s resolution committee has made similar claims
against a number of former executives, including then Chief Risk
Officer Steingrimur Karason and the bank’s Ex-Iceland CEO
Ingolfur Helgason.  To contact the reporter on this story:
