HTC Corp. (2498) ,  Asia ’s second-largest
smartphone maker, declined to the lowest level in five months in
Taipei trading after shipments to the U.S. were delayed because
of concerns by the country’s customs authority.  The shares dropped 6.6 percent to NT$411 at close, the
lowest since Dec. 9. The benchmark  Taiex Index (TWSE)  fell 2.2 percent.  The U.S. availability of HTC One X and HTC EVO 4G LTE has
been delayed because of U.S. customs review of shipments that is
required after an exclusion order by the U.S. International
Trade Commission, the Taoyuan, Taiwan-based company said in an
e-mailed statement today. HTC is in compliance with the ruling
and is working closely with the customs authority to secure
approval, it said.  The smartphone maker is unclear when the issue can be
resolved and a prolonged delay may affect second-quarter sales,
Jeff Pu, an analyst at Fubon Securities Co. in Taipei, said in
an e-mail.  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) , the third-largest U.S. wireless
carrier, was scheduled to sell HTC EVO 4G on Friday.  AT&T Inc. (T) ,
which has been offering One X handsets since May 6, said the
model is out of stock, according to its website.  HTC has been in patent dispute with Apple Inc., which won
an exclusion order late last year for certain HTC phones.  To contact the reporters on this story:
