Palm oil  slumped the most in more
than 14 months as concern that Europe’s debt crisis will worsen
with the possible exit of Greece from the euro zone cut demand
for commodities. Volume was a record 63,019 contracts.  July-delivery futures fell 4.1 percent, the biggest drop
for the most-active price since Feb. 23, 2011, to close at 3,093
ringgit ($992) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange. That’s the lowest settlement price since Feb. 3.
Futures are on course for the first monthly drop since January.
Volume topped the previous high of 48,741 contracts on Nov. 17.  Post-election attempts to form a government in Greece broke
down yesterday as President Karolos Papoulias failed to broker a
coalition.  Greece  will schedule new elections as early as June
10, which German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  called a
referendum on whether the country stays in the euro.  “The market will wait for the political uncertainty to
ease” Alan Lim Seong Chun, an analyst at Kenanga Investment
Bank Bhd., said by phone today. Investors will “wait for Greece
to have a government and see whether they will exit the euro and
whether the new government is pro-austerity or growth.”  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of raw materials
dropped to the lowest level since Dec. 20 as crude oil and
soybeans declined. Commodities may extend their retreat,  BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s biggest mining company, said today.  “External factors are dominating the market,” Vijay
Mehta, a director at Commodity Links Pte., said from  Singapore .
“Fundamentals are not playing any game right now, so we just
have to watch and see how this outside market stabilizes.”  Malaysian Shipments  Malaysian palm oil exports rose 0.7 percent to 599,044 tons
in the first 15 days of May from the same period in April,
Intertek said yesterday. Shipments fell 7 percent to 564,477
tons in the period, estimated Societe Generale de Surveillance.  Soybeans for July delivery lost 1.3 percent to $13.9425 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Soybean oil  for the same
month fell 1.7 percent to 50.61 cents a pound. Palm oil and
soybean oil are both used in foods.  Palm oil for September delivery retreated 1.4 percent to
close at 8,118  yuan  ($1,284) a ton on the Dalian Commodity
Exchange, the lowest close for a most-active contract since Feb.
3. Soybean oil for the same month lost 1.4 percent to 9,230
yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
