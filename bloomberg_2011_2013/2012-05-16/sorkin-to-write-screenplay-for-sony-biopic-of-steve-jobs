Sony Corp. (6758) ’s movie studio hired
screenwriter Aaron Sorkin to give  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  co-founder  Steve Jobs  the  Mark Zuckerberg  treatment.  Sorkin will write and direct the film, based on Walter Isaacson’s biography of Jobs, Culver City, California-based Sony
Pictures Entertainment said yesterday in a statement. The
screenwriter won an Academy Award for his adaptation of “The
Social Network,” the 2010 Sony film that chronicled the early
years of  Facebook Inc. (FB)  under founder Mark Zuckerberg.  The film will mark Sorkin’s directing debut. “Steve
Jobs,” released last year, was the top-selling hardcover of
2011 by a 2-to-1 margin, with 2.25 million books sold, Sony
said, citing  Publishers Weekly data. The book was  Amazon.com
Inc. (AMZN) ’s best-selling book of 2011.  “There is no writer working in Hollywood today who is more
capable of capturing such an extraordinary life for the screen
than Aaron Sorkin,” Sony Pictures Co-Chairman Amy Pascal said
in the statement. ‘In his hands, we’re confident that the film
will be everything that Jobs himself was: captivating,
entertaining and polarizing.’’  The movie is the second one planned covering the life of
Jobs, who died last year at age 56. Ashton Kutcher is set to
play him in an independent production, “Jobs,” Variety
reported in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
