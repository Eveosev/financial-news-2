Asian  stocks  fell, with a regional
benchmark index headed for its biggest loss this year, as
Greece’s move to call new elections increased concern the
country will leave the euro and derail efforts to contain the
region’s debt crisis.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index and Korea’s Kospi index fell
more than 3 percent, entering so-called corrections after
retreating more than 10 percent from recent highs. Nissan Motor
Co., which depends on Europe for about 16 percent of its sales,
slid 2.2 percent in  Tokyo .  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
largest mining company, declined 4.1 percent in Sydney after
metal prices fell.  Toll Holdings Ltd. (TOL) , an Australian trucking
company, sank 15 percent after forecasting lower full-year
profit.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 2.6 percent to 114.13 as
of 8:38 p.m. in Tokyo, headed for its biggest loss since
November. The gauge is poised to close more than 10 percent
below this year’s high on Feb. 29, a retreat some investors call
a correction.  “The Asian market is caught up in global events, as
overseas investors avoid risky assets and drop their overall
positions,” said  Naoki Fujiwara , chief fund manager at Shinkin
Asset Management Co. “The  Greece  issue is the bottleneck. Until
we see the election results it’s hard to actively take a
stance.”  More than seven stocks slid for each that rose on the
measure, which is headed for its longest streak of declines
since April 11.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average declined 1.1 percent even
as the nation’s machinery orders fell less than economists
forecast in March from the previous month. South Korea’s Kospi
Index retreated 3.1 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
dropped 2.4 percent as a survey showed the nation’s  consumer
confidence  was little changed near the lowest level this year.  Relative Value  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index retreated 3.2 percent, while
China’s Shanghai Composite Index fell 1.2 percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, which includes some companies
from  emerging markets , is less than 0.5 percent from erasing
this year’s gains. That compares with a 5.8 percent gain by the
 S&P 500  and a 0.5 percent advance by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 11.9 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with a multiple of 12.7 for the
S&P 500 and 10.2 times for the Stoxx 600.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  rose 0.2 percent
after falling 0.5 percent earlier today. The index slid 0.6
percent in  New York  yesterday amid concern a political impasse
in Greece will destabilize austerity plans in Europe.  Fresh Election  Greek leaders said a second election will be held after
political gridlock left the nation without a government since
elections on May 6. Greeks have withdrawn as much as 700 million
euros ($893 million) from the nation’s banks, President Karolos
Papoulias told party leaders.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President
 Francois Hollande  said they would consider measures to spur
economic growth in Greece as long as voters there committed to
the austerity demanded to stay in the euro.  Nissan dropped 2.2 percent to 752 yen in Tokyo, while
 Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a clothier that depends on Europe for most
of its sales, retreated 5.5 percent to HK$13.30 in Hong Kong.  “As the pressure builds in Europe, you need to see another
mini crisis before policy makers will step in, and we’re not
there yet,” said  Andrew Pease , Sydney-based chief investment
strategist for the Asia-Pacific region at Russell Investment
Group, which manages about $150 billion. “Markets and economies
in Asia are at the mercy of the export story.”  Jiangxi Copper Tumbles  Mining companies declined after the London Metal Exchange
Index of prices for six industrial metals including copper and
aluminum slid 0.6 percent yesterday.  BHP slid 4.1 percent to HK$32.49 in Sydney, while Jiangxi
Copper Co., China’s biggest producer of the metal, fell 6
percent to HK$15.98 in Hong Kong.  Toll Holdings slumped 15 percent to A$4.73 in Sydney, the
 steepest drop  in the  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP) , after saying
earnings before interest and tax will be A$400 million ($397
million) to A$420 million in the 12 months ending June compared
with A$436 million a year earlier.  Stocks that were removed from MSCI indexes dropped on
concern prices will be affected as index-tracked funds adjust
their holdings. Sinofert Holdings Ltd., a Chinese fertilizer
producer, dropped 5.9 percent to HK$1.44, the lowest price since
December 2005. Japanese regional lenders  Hiroshima Bank Ltd. (8379) 
sank 9.1 percent to 280 yen and Hokuhoku Financial Group Inc.
declined 9.1 percent to 120 yen.  Sinofert will be removed from the MSCI China index and the
two regional banks will be deleted from MSCI Japan index
effective May 31, MSCI Inc. said in a statement yesterday.  Olam International Ltd. (OLAM) , one of the world’s top three
suppliers of rice, cocoa, and coffee, dropped 11 percent to
S$1.785 in Singapore after saying third-quarter profit declined
23 percent from a year earlier amid waning demand.  To contact the reporters on this story:
