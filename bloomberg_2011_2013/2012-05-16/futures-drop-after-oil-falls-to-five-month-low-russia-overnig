Russian  stock futures  declined and
shares traded in the U.S. tumbled for a third day after oil sank
to a five-month low.  OAO Mechel (MTL) ,  Russia ’s largest coking coal producer, dropped
to the lowest level since May 2009 yesterday, leading a slump in
the  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  and widening a discount to
the company’s Moscow-listed shares to 4.7 percent, the most
since March. The gauge of the most-traded Russian companies in
 New York  lost 0.8 percent to 89.35, the lowest since Dec. 19.
Futures expiring in June on Russia’s  RTS (RTSI$)  Index retreated 1.3
percent in U.S. trading.  Oil, Russia’s major export earner, fell near a five-month
low on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday while copper
dropped to a four-month low on mounting concern about  Greece 
exiting the euro. Greece will hold new elections after President
Karolos Papoulias failed to broker a governing coalition
following an inconclusive May 6 vote.  “The collapse of the Greek government worries investors
when they look over the next six months,” Ian Hague, who
manages Russian equities as a partner at Firebird Asset
Management, which oversees $1.3 billion, said by phone yesterday
from New York. “We have entered a risk-off trade period and
generally negative oil and commodities prices have much of an
impact on Russia.”  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, retreated 0.9 percent to $25.71 yesterday,
the lowest since Oct. 7. The RTS Volatility Index, which
measures expected swings in the index futures, rose 0.5 percent
to 37.40 points.  Oil Tumbles  Crude oil for June delivery decreased 0.8 percent to $93.98
a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest
settlement since Dec. 19. Prices are down 4.9 percent this year.

gas sales last year.  Brent oil for June settlement gained 0.6 percent to $112.24
a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange. The
more-active July contract rose 0.4 percent, to $111.43.  Urals crude , Russia’s chief export blend, rose 0.5 percent
to $110.09 a barrel, gaining for the first session in six.  OAO Gazprom (OGZPY) , the world’s biggest producer of natural gas
and Russia’s state-run natural gas monopoly, dropped 2.7 percent
to $9.44 in New York yesterday, widening its discount to Moscow
shares to 2.6 percent, the steepest since November 2008. The
 stock  retreated 0.9 percent to 148.25 rubles, or $4.84, on the
Micex yesterday. One Gazprom ADR is equal to two ordinary
shares.  Mechel Slumps  Mechel (MTLR)  declined 5.3 percent to $6.43 in New York. The stock

Prices earlier touched $3.5005, the lowest for a most-active
contract since Jan. 11.  The ruble weakened for an eighth day yesterday,
depreciating 0.6 percent to 30.60 per dollar by the close in
Moscow, extending its longest stretch of declines since Dec. 14,
2011.  The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  added 0.5 percent to 1,344.75 in
Moscow yesterday, after  Russia’s Federal Statistics Service 
reported gross domestic product grew at the fastest pace in the
first quarter since the three months ended September 2011. The
dollar-denominated RTS index fell 0.1 percent to 1,400.77, the
lowest since Jan. 2.  VimpelCom, MTS  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) , the world’s sixth-largest wireless
operator, fell 0.1 percent to $9.08 in New York yesterday. The
company reported first-quarter adjusted net income of $354
million, beating the $345 million median estimate of four
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg as sales in Russia climbed 11
percent.  OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) , Russia’s largest mobile operator
also known as MTS, fell 2 percent to $16.42 in New York
yesterday, the lowest since Jan. 24.  VimpelCom trades at 7.4 times estimated earnings, a 20
percent discount to the multiple of MTS, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “VimpelCom published very strong results confirming the
turnaround in Russia,” Tibor Bokor, the London-based research
director for telecommunication stocks in Europe, the  Middle East 
and  Africa  at ING AG, said via e-mail. “On top of that
VimpelCom stock underperformed MTS. The correction in VimpelCom
has been overdone and needs adjustment.”  United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer,
fell 2.3 percent to HK$4.78 in Hong Kong trading as of 11:54
a.m. local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 2.3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
