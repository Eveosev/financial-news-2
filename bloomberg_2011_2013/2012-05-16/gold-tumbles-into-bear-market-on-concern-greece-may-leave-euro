Gold, on the brink of a  bear market ,
declined for a fourth straight session as concern that  Greece 
will have to leave the euro boosted the dollar and cut the
metal’s appeal as an alternative asset.  The U.S. Dollar Index, a measure against six major
counterparts, rose for a 13th day to a four-month high after
Greece’s political leaders failed to form a ruling coalition.  “The market no longer seems to be seems pricing in whether
Greece will leave the Europe Union, rather when it will
happen,” Steve Scacalossi, a New York-based vice president at
TD Securities Inc., wrote in a report. “The risk-off tone
continued.”  Gold futures for June delivery fell 1.3 percent to settle
at $1,536.60 at 1:45 p.m. on the Comex in  New York . The
settlement leaves prices down 19 percent from a record close of
$1,891.90 reached on Aug. 22, about 1 percentage point shy of a
bear market.  Earlier, bullion slumped to $1,526.70, the lowest since
Dec. 29 and 21 percent below the record $1,923.70 it touched on
Sept. 6. The metal erased its gains for the year on May 14.  Investor  George Soros  increased his holdings in the SPDR
Gold Trust, the biggest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, in the
first quarter, while billionaire  John Paulson  maintained his
stake, filings showed yesterday.  Silver futures for July delivery dropped 3.1 percent to
$27.196 an ounce on the Comex, after sliding to $26.73, the
lowest since Dec. 29.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , palladium futures for
June delivery slipped 1.2 percent to $594.10 an ounce. Platinum
futures for July delivery retreated 1 percent to $1,432.20 an
ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
