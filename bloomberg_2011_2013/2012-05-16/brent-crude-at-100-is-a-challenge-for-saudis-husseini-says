Saudi Arabia’s target for reducing
 Brent crude  to $100 a barrel may be difficult to sustain as 
declining production capacity and Europe’s ban on Iranian imports 
put upward pressure on prices, according to a former executive of
Saudi Arabian Oil Co.  “The $100 for Brent is quite a correction and it will be a
challenge to sustain such a low price beyond the short term,”
Sadad al-Husseini, the founder of Husseini Energy, a Dhahran-
based researcher, said today in an e-mail.  Brent crude is trading at about $111.50 a barrel in London
after dropping 13 percent since the start of March as concern
eased that supplies from the  Middle East  would be disrupted.
Prices may fall further as global supply is outstripping demand,
Saudi Oil Minister  Ali al-Naimi  said May 13. “We need to get
the price to a level of around $100” for Brent, al-Naimi said.  OPEC’s spare capacity dropped to 2.38 million barrels a day
in April, compared with 2.54 million the previous month,
according to the  International Energy Agency . That figure
excludes Iraq, Nigeria, Libya and Iran.  Capacity is being eroded throughout the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, Mexico and Russia, according to
Al-Husseini, who left state-run Saudi Arabian Oil in 2004 as
executive vice president for exploration and development.  To contact the reporter on this story:
