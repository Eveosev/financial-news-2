Seven Libyan fighters died in clashes
between militias in the western city of Ghademes, a government
official said.  Members of the Touareg tribe, which had sided with  Muammar Qaddafi  in the uprising that led to his ouster and killing,
attacked the local Ghademes militia early today, killing one of
its militiamen, Alttaib El-Kebeer, a member of the city’s
reconciliation committee, said in a telephone interview. Six
Touareg fighters were killed during the ensuing battle, said
Libyan government spokesman Nasser Elmaneh. The fighting injured
more than 20 people, he said.  Clashes between militias and tribes in  Libya  have become
common since Qaddafi was pushed from power after last year’s
uprising. The Libyan army entered the city to restore order,
Elmaneh said.  The interim authority, the National Transitional Council,
has struggled to disarm the militias, thwarting efforts to
rebuild the nation that sits atop  Africa ’s largest proven
reserves of crude.  To contact the reporter on this story:
