     May 16 (Bloomberg) --The number of tourists visiting Egypt
in March rose to about 927,000, a 73.2 percent increase from the
same month a year earlier, the state-run news agency reported
today.  The increase is attributed to the “sharp decrease” in
tourist numbers in March 2011, after the revolt that ousted
former President  Hosni Mubarak , the Middle East News Agency
said, citing the official statistics agency.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
