Malaysia’s ringgit fell the most
among Asian currencies, as  Greece ’s failure to form a government
damped appetite for riskier assets.  The ringgit declined 1 percent to 3.1102 per dollar as of
9:47 a.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , to touch its weakest level since Jan.
20, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, rose 20 basis points to 7 percent.  Post-election attempts to form a ruling coalition in Athens
broke down yesterday, sending Greeks back to the polls next
month with surveys giving the lead to an anti-bailout party.
Prior to today, the ringgit had been the second-biggest gainer
this year among 11 Asian currencies tracked by Bloomberg, after
the Singapore dollar.  “The news that Greece will have new elections increases
the risk of Greece exiting from the euro area,” said  Thomas
Harr , the Singapore-based head of Asian foreign-exchange
strategy at Standard Chartered Plc. “Secondly, it’s China’s
slowdown. Those two things are driving markets at the moment.”  Foreign direct investment in China fell for a sixth month
in April, the longest stretch of declines since the global
financial crisis, government figures showed yesterday. The
country was the second-biggest buyer of Malaysian exports in
March, according to official data.  Government bonds  retreated. The yield on the 3.314 percent
notes due October 2017 climbed two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 3.31 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
