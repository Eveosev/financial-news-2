Jerry Sandusky, the former
 Pennsylvania  State University assistant football coach accused
of sexually assaulting boys, revived his request to have the
charges against him dismissed.  The prosecution’s allegations regarding four victims lack
specificity and are so generalized that he can’t adequately
prepare a defense, Sandusky said today in court papers. The
state can’t present sufficient evidence on a fifth alleged
victim and still doesn’t know the identity of two others,
according to the filing by Sandusky’s attorney Joseph Amendola.  State court Judge  John M. Cleland  in Bellefonte,
Pennsylvania, last month denied Sandusky’s initial request to
dismiss the charges. Prosecutors this month said one alleged
incident took place a year earlier than previously claimed. That
incident involved one of the unidentified alleged victims.  Sandusky, 68, is scheduled to face trial June 5 on more
than 50 criminal counts tied to the alleged abuse of boys he met
through a charity he founded for needy children. The case led to
the firings of Penn State President  Graham Spanier  and head
football coach  Joe Paterno , who died in January.  The case is Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Sandusky, CP-
14-2422-2011, Court of Common Pleas, Centre County, Pennsylvania
(Bellefonte).  To contact the reporter on this story:
