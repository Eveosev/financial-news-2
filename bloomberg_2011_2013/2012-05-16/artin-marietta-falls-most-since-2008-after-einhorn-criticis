Martin Marietta  Materials Inc. fell
the most in more than three years, triggering a circuit breaker
that halted trading, after Greenlight Capital co-founder David
Einhorn said the sand-and-gravel producer had problems.  “Recent earnings benefited from one time fiscal stimulus
that is about to wind down,” Einhorn said at a conference in
New York.  Martin Marietta slid 6.6 percent to $69.76 at 3:47 p.m. in
New York, after plunging as much as 15 percent for the steepest
intraday decline since November 2008.  Vulcan Materials Co. (VMC) , the target of a failed hostile
takeover by Martin Marietta, also tumbled, dropping 9.1 percent
to $34.88.  To contact the reporter on this story:
