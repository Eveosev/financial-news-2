The steep fall in Irish  house prices 
may drive losses on foreclosed home loans to as high as 70
percent, according a Moody’s Investors Service report based on
mortgage-backed securities it tracks.  “Over half the loans in even the best pools are in
negative equity, whereas nearly every loan is in negative equity
in the worst pools,” analysts Maria Divid and Barbara Rismondo
in  London  said in a report today. “There is little chance that
distressed borrowers will be able to significantly increase
their debt service abilities; or materially reduce their
negative equity.”  House prices dropped 49 percent from their high in 2007,
Ireland’s Central Statistics Office said April 26. Prices may
decline as much as 60 percent from that peak, Moody’s said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
