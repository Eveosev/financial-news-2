Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said capital shortages in Greece’s banking system could
cause a financial shock that may impact Canada.  Flaherty, speaking today to a parliamentary committee in
Ottawa, said Canadian banks are “not completely immune” to the
turmoil in Europe even though their exposure is limited.  The  European Central Bank  said today it will temporarily
stop lending to some Greek banks to limit its risk as President
Mario Draghi signaled the ECB won’t compromise on key principles
to keep Greece in the euro area.  “We have serious concerns about what’s happening in the
euro zone,” Flaherty told reporters after the hearing. “In the
absence of a government in Greece, it’s very difficult for
Greece to deal with its implementation of its austerity
program.”  The minister reiterated  Canada ’s position that Europe
should use its own resources to solve the region’s sovereign
debt troubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
