The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
was little changed today at 875.60 by the close in Prague after
falling to the lowest in almost five months yesterday.  The following were among the most active  equities  in the
Czech market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)   of Austria jumped 1.9 percent
to 378 koruna, reversing an earlier 3.8 percent decline.
European shares erased losses, with banks leading the rebound,
as Greek leaders seek agreement on an interim government and
 France ’s borrowing costs fell in a bond auction.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)   dropped for a fourth day
to its lowest in almost three years as commodities declined,
overshadowing the Czech coking-coal producer’s unexpected first-
quarter profit. The stock slid 2.7 percent to 109.5 koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
