France sold 8 billion euros ($10.2
billion) in bonds, with borrowing costs falling in the first
auction after President  Francois Hollande  took power.  France auctioned the maximum amount targeted by Agence
France-Tresor, the debt-management agency, selling two-, three-,
four- and five-year securities. The average yield on the
September 2014 notes was 0.74 percent, compared with 0.85
percent at the last auction on April 19. On the February 2017
debt, it was 1.72 percent, down from 1.83 percent in the
previous sale.  The lower borrowing costs come even as speculation
intensifies that  Greece  may drop out of the single currency more
than two years after its budget-deficit blowout triggered a
financial crisis across  Europe . Greece yesterday said it will
hold new elections after President Karolos Papoulias failed to
form a ruling coalition, threatening spending cuts required to
secure 240 billion euros in bailouts.      Hollande, who was sworn in yesterday as the seventh
president of the Fifth Republic, met with German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel  in Berlin, with the leaders of Europeâ€™s two
largest economies saying they would consider measures to spur
economic growth in Greece as long as voters there committed to
the austerity demanded to stay in the euro.  The French debt auction came as spreads, or the yield
difference, relative to German bunds widened in several
countries in the region. French 10-year bonds fell for a third
day before the sale. The spread between French 10-year
 government bonds  and similar-maturity bunds widened to 151 basis
points and was at 144 basis points as of 11:08 a.m. in Paris.  Widening Spreads  Spanish and Italian bonds tumbled. The extra yield, or
spread, investors demand to hold Spanish 10-year bonds instead
of benchmark German debt widened to a euro-era record of more
than 5 percentage points.   German 10-year yields approached an all-time low as
investors sought safer assets. The country will sell an
additional 5 billion euros  of its benchmark bund. The according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.      France  sold 2.505 billion euros of September 2014 notes,
945 million euros of April 2015 bonds, 895 million euros of
April 2016 securities and 3.651 billion euros of February 2017
debt.      The country is also selling as much as 1.2 billion euros of
inflation-linked debt.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
