executive officer of ICAP Plc, said in an interview on Bloomberg
Television. “I think it is better for  Greece  in the long run
and certainly better for the  euro zone .”  Greece yesterday called a new election after President
Karolos Papoulias failed to broker a governing coalition in
meetings yesterday with Pasok party head  Evangelos Venizelos  and
other political leaders.  Greece’s Democratic Left leader, Fotis Kouvelis, said the
sole task of a new caretaker government decided by party leaders
today would be to hold elections, which would most likely be set
for June 17.  Merkel, Hollande  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and new French President
 Francois Hollande  said they would consider measures to spur
economic growth in Greece as long as voters committed to the
austerity demanded to stay in the euro.  The European Union may also “approach Greece with
proposals,” Merkel said late yesterday at a joint press
conference with Hollande during his first official visit to
Berlin. “Greece can stay in the euro area.”  Stocks extended losses in the final half hour of trading as
