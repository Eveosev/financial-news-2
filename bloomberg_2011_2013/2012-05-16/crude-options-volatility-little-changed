Crude-oil options volatility rose as
the underlying futures slid to the lowest level in more than six
months.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 28.75 percent at 4:20 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , up from 28.63 yesterday. Volatility
has increased from below 21 percent on April 27 as futures
prices have dropped $12.12.  Crude oil for June delivery declined $1.17, or 1.2 percent,
to $92.81 a barrel on the Nymex, the lowest settlement since
Nov. 2.  The most-active oil options in electronic trading today

4:23 p.m. with 7,169 lots trading. June $90 puts were the
second-most active options with 5,726 lots changing hands as
they added 3 cents to 12 cents.  Puts accounted for 62 percent of electronic trading volume.
