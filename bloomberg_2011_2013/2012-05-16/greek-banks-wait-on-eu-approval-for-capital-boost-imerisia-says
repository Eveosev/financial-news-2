Greece ’s four biggest banks are
waiting for European Union approval to receive 18 billion euros
($23 billion) of bonds issued by the European Financial
Stability Facility for their recapitalization,  Imerisia 
reported, without saying how it got the information.  EU finance ministers discussed the issue at a meeting in
Brussels this week and the holdup is due to disagreement between
the EFSF and the  European Central Bank , the newspaper said. The
ECB wants the banks to be given the bonds as share capital, so
they can use them in its refinancing operations, while the EFSF
wants preconditions to be set because of Greece’s political
uncertainty, Imerisia said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
