U.S. regulators will start pursuing
maximum fines against people caught shining laser pointers at
aircraft after incidents last year climbed to record levels, the
 Federal Aviation Administration  said.  The directive today from FAA Administrator Michael Huerta
comes after reported laser incidents rose to 3,592 in 2011, more
than double the 1,527 cases in 2009, according to agency data.
There were 2,836 incidents reported in 2010, the agency said.  Lasers pointed at a cockpit can temporarily diminish
eyesight or blind pilots of incoming planes, according to FAA
research. Some industrial lasers are capable of damaging the
eye, according to the research.  “Shining a laser at an airplane is not a laughing
matter,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in the
release. “It’s dangerous for both pilots and passengers, and we
will not tolerate it.”  Last June, the FAA  issued  a legal opinion that shining a
laser at an aircraft constituted interfering with a flight crew,
which is punishable by civil fines that can amount to as much as
$11,000.  The highest fine proposed by the agency so far was $30,800
in a case involving multiple incidents, according to the
agency’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
