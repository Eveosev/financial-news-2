Beverly is the bossy-boots wife who
smooches strong, silent Tony in front of her nervy husband.
Tony’s mousy wife and neurotic neighbor Susan look on.  The  London  revival of  Mike Leigh ’s “Abigail’s Party” has
Jill Halfpenny playing loudmouth Beverly. She delivers well-
timed lines such as “just because a picture happens to be
erotic, doesn’t make it pornographic.”  Her nastiness turns 1970s hell on earth into a bleak
comedy. She hands around the booze, canapes and insults -- then
pushes the others over the edge.  Wyndhams Theatre, Charing Cross Road, WC2H 0DA.

cheese and canned pineapple, you’re out of luck.  More exotic snacks are available at Dishoom, a nearby
Indian cafe, where the menu includes chili-cheese toast and
pineapple & black-pepper crumble.  Information:  http://www.dishoom.com/  or +44-20-7420-9320.  Saturday  Liz Hurley’s figure-hugging dress is now a museum piece.  Not the one held together with safety pins: the long floral
gown that the model wore in 1999 for an Estee Lauder cosmetics
commercial. It’s now fitted on a mannequin in the V&A’s
“Ballgowns: British Glamour Since 1950” show.  Up a grand flight of stairs in the slickly refurbished
fashion galleries are more recent red-carpet numbers. There’s
 Annette Bening ’s black jumpsuit,  Sandra Bullock ’s off-shoulder
tulle gown, and Maggie Gyllenhaal’s asymmetrical gala dress.  The emphasis being on British design, there are few, if
any, French gowns in the mix. The show runs from May 19 through
Jan. 6, 2013.  Information:  http://www.vam.ac.uk  or +44-20-7942-2000.  Cassis, a short walk from the V&A, is a stylish French
bistro where your best party frock wouldn’t look out of place.
It’s owned by Marlon Abela, the restaurateur whose venues
include Umu and the Greenhouse in London and A Voce in the Time
Warner Center,  New York . Information:

nationwide Museums at Night weekend. Alternatives include life
drawing at the  National Portrait Gallery , lifting a 13-kilo gold
bar at the Bank of England Museum, or gazing at the galaxy
inside the Royal Observatory in Greenwich.  Information:  http://www.culture24.org.uk .  Sunday  Duane Eddy  brings his twangy rock ‘n’ roll sound to London
for a rare show that will revive hits such as “Rebel Rouser” and
“Peter Gunn.”  The 74-year-old guitarist sounds as good as his 1950s
heyday when he was seen as a rival to  Elvis Presley .  Queen Elizabeth Hall, Belvedere Road, SE1 8XX. Information:
