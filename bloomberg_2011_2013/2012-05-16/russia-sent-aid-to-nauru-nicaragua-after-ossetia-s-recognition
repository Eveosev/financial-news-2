Russia  extended financial aid to
Nicaragua and Nauru, two of the nations that recognized the
Georgian separatist region of  South Ossetia , according to the
 Finance Ministry .  Nicaragua and Nauru, a Pacific island nation, joined
Kyrgyzstan in sharing $50 million in funds Russia allocated in
2010 for improvements in health care, infrastructure and
education, the ministry said in a presentation distributed to
reporters in Moscow today.  Recognition of South Ossetia’s independence was one of
“numerous factors” that influenced the decision to disburse
aid, Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak said. “We weren’t
pursuing any political goals in providing assistance.”  South Ossetia and Abkhazia, another separatist region,
declared independence after a five-day war between Russia and
the former Soviet republic of Georgia in August 2008. U.S. ally
Georgia maintains Russia occupied the two regions after the
conflict. Russia established diplomatic ties with Tuvalu last
September.  Tuvalu, formerly known as the Ellice Islands, is a nation
of about 12,000 people located midway between Hawaii and
 Australia . It’s a constitutional monarchy that comprises four
reef islands and five coral atolls.  To contact the reporter on this story:
