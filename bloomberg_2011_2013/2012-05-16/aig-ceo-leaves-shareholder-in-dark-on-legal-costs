American International Group Inc. (AIG) ,
the insurer majority owned by the U.S. Treasury Department after
a 2008 bailout, declined to reveal legal costs in response to
the only investor who asked a question at its annual meeting.  “I don’t believe we go through and identify that as a
number that we go public with,” Chief Executive Officer  Robert Benmosche , 67, told the man who identified himself as an AIG
shareholder at the meeting today in New York. “We are working
very hard to work that list down and we also do very strong
competitive bidding on legal costs, so it’s not a free-for-all.
You may think it’s a feeding frenzy on this company. It is
not.”  The investor cited the 17-page summary of litigation and
investigations in AIG’s quarterly filing to the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission, including regulatory probes and
disputes with shareholders, competitors, ex-executives and a
former subsidiary. Benmosche has worked to resolve lawsuits as
the Treasury winds down its stake.  “I can tell you that our legal expenses are coming down
dramatically,” Benmosche said.  The Treasury has cut its  stake  in the New York-based
insurer to 61 percent from 92 percent in January 2011 through
three share sales. The U.S. raised $5.8 billion in the most
recent offering on May 6 by selling about 189 million shares for
$30.50 apiece. The government needs to divest its stake at an
average price of about $28.72 to break even on its investment.  AIG slipped 1.7 percent to $30.45 at 4:02 p.m. in  New York 
and has gained 31 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
