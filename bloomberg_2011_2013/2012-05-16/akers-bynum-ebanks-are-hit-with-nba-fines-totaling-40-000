Andrew Bynum  and Devin Ebanks of the
Los Angeles Lakers were fined a total of $40,000 by the  National
Basketball Association  for separate violations.  Bynum was fined $15,000 for failing to make himself
available to the media following yesterday’s practice, the
league said in an e-mailed statement. Ebanks will lose $25,000
for his actions before and after his ejection in the Lakers’
loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder in Game 1 of their playoff
series.  After shoving Thunder guard Royal Ivey in the closing
minutes of the 119-90 loss, Ebanks argued with officials and
then punched a chair and pulled his jersey off when he was
thrown out of the game.  The Lakers play Game 2 of the best-of-seven Western
Conference series tonight in Oklahoma City.  To contact the reporter on this story:
