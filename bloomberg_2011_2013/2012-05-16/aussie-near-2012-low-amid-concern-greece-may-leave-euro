Australia ’s dollar traded close to
its weakest level this year as  Greece ’s failure to form a new
government spurred speculation it may leave the euro area,
sapping demand for riskier assets.  The so-called Aussie was near a four-month low against the
yen as Asian stocks fell for a sixth-straight day, extending a
global equities rout. The  New Zealand  dollar maintained three
days of losses after Auckland-based Fonterra Cooperative Group
Ltd., the world’s largest dairy exporter, said whole-milk powder
prices continued their slide, falling to the lowest level in
more than 2 1/2 years.  “It’s just a general bout of  risk aversion  around the
globe,” said Derek Mumford, a director in Sydney at Rochford
Capital, a currency risk management company. “It’s not just
Greece, it’s the whole European situation. The Aussie is
certainly under pressure.”  Australia’s dollar traded at 99.46 U.S. cents as of 10:53
a.m. in Sydney from 99.37 in  New York  yesterday, when it slid as
low as 99.22, the weakest since Dec. 20. The currency bought
79.94 yen from 79.67 yesterday when it touched 79.39, the lowest
since Jan. 17. The  New Zealand dollar  bought 76.92 U.S. cents,
having declined 0.9 percent to 76.93 cents yesterday. It was at
61.83 yen from 61.68.  Mumford predicts the Australian currency will drop as low
as 97.50 U.S. cents within the next couple of weeks.  Greek Election  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of stocks dropped 0.6 percent
today. The MSCI World Index of developed market shares fell 0.9
percent yesterday.  Greek leaders will seek agreement today on an interim
government that will schedule new elections as early as June 10,
after President Karolos Papoulias failed to broker a governing
coalition in meetings yesterday.  The new election will follow an inconclusive May 6 vote
that pushed a political party opposed to Greece’s international
bailout into second place. Public opinion polls say that party,
Syriza, may come in first next time, complicating Greece’s
efforts to avoid running out of cash by early July.  Elsewhere in  Europe , investor concern over Spain’s ability
to reduce its budget shortfall has increased since Prime
Minister  Mariano Rajoy  announced in March that the country will
miss a 2012 deficit goal set by the European Union.  Spanish 10-
year yields  this week climbed as high as 6.36 percent, the most
since Nov. 30.  Milk Prices  In New Zealand, Fonterra said milk powder for July delivery
fell 9.6 percent from the May 1 sale to the lowest price since
August 2009, according to a trade-weighted index. The near-term
contract fell for the 11th straight auction to $2,488 a metric
ton, the company said on its GlobalDairyTrade website.  The results “only add to the evidence suggesting next
season’s Fonterra dairy payout will be considerably lower than
the season just ending,”  Mike Jones , a currency strategist at
Bank of New Zealand Ltd. in Wellington, wrote in a research
note.  Demand for Australia’s currency was also limited after a
private survey showed the nation’s  consumer confidence  was
little changed near the lowest level this year as concern about
the global outlook countered the boost provided by this month’s
decision by the country’s central bank to lower borrowing costs.  The sentiment index for May rose 0.8 percent to 95.3, a
 Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  and Melbourne Institute survey taken May
7-11 of 1,200 consumers showed today in Sydney. From a year
earlier, confidence is down 8.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
