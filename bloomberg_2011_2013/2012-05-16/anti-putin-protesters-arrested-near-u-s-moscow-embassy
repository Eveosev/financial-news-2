About 20 Russian protesters
demonstrating against President  Vladimir Putin  were arrested in
central Moscow today, Interfax reported, citing the press office
of the Moscow police.  The protesters were detained as they gathered near the U.S.
Embassy after their camp at Chistye Prudy station was removed by
the police early this morning, Interfax said, adding that one
police officer was injured.  Police detained hundreds of people in Moscow on May 6 after
clashes between riot officers and thousands of demonstrators
rallying against Putin one day before his inauguration as
president.  To contact the reporter on this story:
