Australia fly-half  Quade Cooper  will
make his return after a near seven-month knee injury layoff in
the  Queensland Reds ’ May 19 Super Rugby game against the Lions.  Cooper, who ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament Oct. 21
when playing for the Wallabies against  Wales  in the Rugby World
Cup third-place playoff, was today named to start in the
playmaking role at Brisbane’s Suncorp Stadium.  Cooper’s inclusion comes after he responded positively to a
series of tests at a team training session yesterday, the Reds
said on their website. He played in all 18 games last season to
help the Reds win their first southern hemisphere provincial
championship in rugby’s professional era.  “It has been a long layoff for him and the next few weeks
before our bye will be invaluable as he again finds his feet,”
Reds coachEwen McKenziesaid in a statement. “Everyone is
excited to see him back out there, but it’s important we manage
him the right way during this period.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
