U.S. stocks erased gains as financial
companies and commodity producers led the market lower after an
early gain triggered by faster-than-forecast growth in housing
starts and industrial production.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index was down less than 0.1
percent at 1,330.14 at 1:32 p.m. in  New York  after climbing as
much as 0.8 percent earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
