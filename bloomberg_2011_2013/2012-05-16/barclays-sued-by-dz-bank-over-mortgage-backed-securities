Barclays Plc (BARC) , the U.K.’s second-
biggest bank by assets, was sued by  DZ Bank  AG in New York state
court over $133.3 million in residential mortgage-backed
securities.  DZ Bank, Germany’s largest cooperative lender, sued London-
based Barclays in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan
today, alleging claims including fraud and negligent
misrepresentation, according to a court document.  The bank, based in Frankfurt, also sued JPMorgan Chase &
Co., the biggest U.S. lender by assets, and HSBC Holdings Plc,
Europe’s biggest bank, in the same court this year over
residential mortgage-backed securities.  Kerrie Cohen , a New York-based spokeswoman for Barclays,
declined to comment on the lawsuit in an e-mail.  Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
market for the securities evaporated.  The case is Deutsche Zentral Genossenschaftsbank AG v.
Barclays Bank Plc, 651708/2012,  New York  State Supreme Court
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
