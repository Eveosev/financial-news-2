Cerberus Capital Management LP, the
private-equity firm led by  Stephen Feinberg , agreed to buy the
assets of insolvent German residential real estate investor
Speymill Deutsche Immobilien Co. after restructuring 985 million
euros ($1.26 billion) of distressed bank loans.  Speymill Deutsche received new capital in the form of
subordinated debt and equity that will be used mainly to pay
down debt and “make improvements to the assets,” New York-
based Cerberus said today in a statement.  “The banks benefit from this transaction by having a large
portfolio of non-performing loans converted to performing loans,
while stakeholders benefit from Cerberus injecting new capital
for improvements and leading the execution of a turn-around of
the assets,” Lee Millstein, senior managing director at
Cerberus, said in the statement.  NIBC Bank NV, HSH Nordbank AG and Norddeutsche Landesbank
led lenders of Isle of Man-based Speymill, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
