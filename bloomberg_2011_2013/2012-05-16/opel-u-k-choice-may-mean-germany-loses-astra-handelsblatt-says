A decision at Adam Opel AGâ€™s U.K.
site in Ellesmere Port today may lead to the Ruesselsheim,
Germany plant losing production of the Astra car,  Handelsblatt 
said, citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter.  Workers in Ellesmere Port will vote today on a 40-hour
week, additional shifts and more temporary staff, the German
newspaper said. A vote in favor of the measures may lead to a
decision by the end of the week on where the Astra is made from
2015, Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
