Finland’s mining companies stand to
face tougher rules as environmental damage prompts regulators to
check the Nordic nation’s mining boom.  Talvivaara Mining Co. (TALV) , whose nickel mine discharges are
turning nearby lakes saline, will be slapped with tighter
guidelines on emissions and  Nordic Mines AB (NOMI) , a Swedish gold
explorer, has endured calls by local residents for a temporary
halt to its mining operations.  Finland’s natural resources, including gold, copper and
nickel, have become lucrative as global demand for metals drives
up prices. More than 500 mining claims and 60 mining permits
were being processed by Finnish authorities in September 2011,
according to a government report.  “When mines are established, the initial hype around
wealth and new jobs stifles critical voices,” Heidi Hautala,
the minister in charge of state shareholdings, told reporters in
Helsinki yesterday. Still, environmental groups are getting
their voices heard.  Talvivaara’s emissions of sulfate, sodium and manganese
into lakes near its Sotkamo nickel mine caused protests from
conservation groups and local residents, adding to pressure on
authorities to cut permitted emission levels. Environment
Minister Ville Niinistoe has signaled the Espoo, Finland-based
company ultimately faces losing its license to operate.  Mine Emissions  Nordic Mines, which runs the Laiva mine outside Raahe in
central  Finland , has also weathered demands from local citizens
for temporary closing over waste water discharges. High aluminum
and sulfate content at lakes near  Dragon Mining Ltd. (DRA) ’s Orivesi
gold mine in western Finland prompted the regional authority to
investigate emissions by the Australian company.  Talvivaara shares fell for the third day, losing 2.5
percent to 147.60 pence at 12:48 p.m. in  London . Nordic Mines
slid 4.8 percent to 29.80 kronor.  Finland ranked second among 93 countries and states in a
survey of the most attractive areas for mining companies,
according to a Feb. 23 publication by the  Vancouver , Canada-
based Fraser Institute. The Nordic nation has been in the
survey’s top 10 for the last three years and came behind the
Canadian province of  New Brunswick .  Talvivaara’s emissions into lakes around its mine caused
the formation of saline layers on lake bottoms, potentially
posing a threat to local wildlife.  “Some of the emission regulations will be tightened at the
end of the year,” said Sami Koivula, an environmental counselor
at northern Finland’s AVI, the regional authority responsible
for setting the allowed pollution levels for Talvivaara’s
permit.  Permit Under Review  The review of Talvivaara’s environment permit for the
Sotkamo nickel mine in northern Finland starts at the end of the
month, according to the regulator. The power to monitor
compliance with the guidelines is vested in another local
authority, the ELY Center. Mines flouting rules face the
ultimate threat of closing, decided on by the ELY Center rather
than ministers.  Finland’s minerals industry had sales of about 3.6 billion
euros ($4.6 billion) and employed about 12,000 people on average
in 2008 to 2010, according to the government’s minerals
strategy. The volume of metallic ores mined in the country may
increase to 70 million metric tons by 2020 from about 4 million
tons in 2000, according to the report.  State Shareholdings  The Finnish state is a shareholder in Talvivaara through
its holding company Solidium Oy, which has an 8.6 percent stake
in the miner. The combined share of the nation’s two largest
pension funds, Varma Mutual Pension Insurance Co. and Ilmarinen
Mutual Pension Insurance Co., is about 15 percent, according to
Talvivaara’s website.  Authorities must strike a balance between protecting the
environment and meeting the needs of the industry.  “I expect the new emission rules will be sensible, taking
into account the environment and the prerequisites of our
operation,” Pekka Perae, chairman of the board and founder of
Talvivaara, said by phone yesterday. He declined to comment on
how much the tighter regulations could cost the company and said
he “isn’t worried” about the threat of shutdown.  The Finnish Association of Nature Conservation asked the
ELY Center to shut down Talvivaara’s operations until pollution
levels are brought under control. The authority declined, saying
Talvivaara is able to adequately reduce the harmful water
emissions, according to a ruling on May 9.  Faster Than Planned  The miner is spending 13 million euros to fix the
emissions, including the installation of a water treatment
system and a catalytic burning unit, according to a statement on
April 24. It may achieve the lower permit limits proposed for
2015 two years earlier than planned, the company said.  “Talvivaara’s current investments are not nearly enough to
bring the emissions down to the level where they should be,”
Hanna Hakko, environmental policy officer at the conservation
organization, said by phone. Talvivaara’s  shares  have lost 26
percent this year, compared with an 8.5 percent drop for the
 Bloomberg World Mining Index. (BWMING)  Nordic Mines slid 54 percent.  Environment Minister Niinistoe has also proposed a mining
tax to compensate for the damage caused by excavation. Economy
Minister Jyri Haekaemies has commissioned a review of tax models
used by other countries, newspaper  Helsingin Sanomat  reported
today.  “The revenue should benefit both the region where the
environmentally burdening activity occurs and the nation whose
natural resources are being utilized,” Niinistoe said
yesterday. “The tax should be linked to the volume excavated,
creating an incentive for companies to reduce their
environmental burden.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
