South Korea  said it would form a 500
billion won ($430 million) fund to help lower borrowing costs
for small and medium companies.  Public institutions will contribute to the fund, the
 finance ministry  said in a statement without specifying which
agencies would participate. Twenty state-owned funds and 10
public institutions will deposit “extra cash” into the
facility, which will be used from August, according to the
statement.  The measure to aid small companies comes amid a worsening
sovereign-debt crisis in  Europe  that threatens to curb the
nation’s exports and stem job growth. Borrowing costs for small
firms with lower credit ratings often exceed a 10 percent annual
interest rate, the ministry statement said.  As many as 2,000 small-to-medium companies will benefit
from the fund, Hong Nam Ki, head of the economic policy
coordination bureau at the finance ministry, told reporters in
Seoul today. The measure could lower borrowing costs by as much
as 2 percentage points annually, Hong said.  Local banks are expected to bid to co-manage the fund along
with the  Industrial Bank of Korea (024110) , according to the finance
ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
