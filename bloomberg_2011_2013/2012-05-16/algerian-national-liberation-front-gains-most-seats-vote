Official results from  Algeria ’s
elections showed President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s National
Liberation Front and its allies won a majority in a vote that
sparked accusations of fraud by Islamists, who came third.  Bouteflika’s party took 221 seats and the National
Democratic Rally, the party of Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia, was
second with 70 seats, Tayeb Belaiz, the president of the
constitutional council said on television late yesterday.  The Islamist Green Algeria Alliance won 47 seats, according
to Belaiz. The alliance, a bloc that groups the Movement of
Society for Peace, Ennahda and the Islah party, was expecting a
strong showing in the vote in which 44 parties competed for
seats in the newly-expanded 462-seat legislature. The government
has rejected accusations of fraud.  The race was one of the measures designed to ensure the
oil-rich North African country avoided the popular uprisings
that swept neighboring Tunisia and Libya as well as  Egypt , and
pushed Islamist parties to the political forefront.  Organizations including the  United Nations , the European
Union and the  Arab League  sent observers to monitor the vote in
the country which suffered decades of violence that left more
than 200,000 people dead and was sparked by the military’s
intervention in the 1991 vote that Islamists were poised to win.
Voter turnout was 42.4 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
