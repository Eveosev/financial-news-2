Iran ’s oil exports have the potential
to fall another 300,000 to 500,000 barrels a day or more when
the European Union’s embargo takes effect in July, according to
Barclays Plc.  The decline will extend existing losses of 500,000 barrels
a day, Barclays analysts led by Helima Croft in  London  said in
an e-mailed report yesterday. Iranian exports may fall even
further because of the unavailability of shipping insurance, she
said.  “The risk from the lack of shipping reinsurance is that in
a market in which fundamentals are set to tighten in coming
months, any loss of Iranian output sustainably beyond 1.5
million barrels a day can provide a significant upside to
prices,” the analysts said.  The EU banned the purchase, transportation, financing and
insurance of Iranian oil. That affects 95 percent of the world’s
tankers because they’re covered by the 13 members of the London-
based  International Group  of P&I Clubs.  The U.S. and EU are trying to pressure Iran over its
nuclear program, which they say is aimed at producing atomic
weapons. The government in Tehran, facing four sets of United
Nations sanctions, says the project is for civilian purposes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
