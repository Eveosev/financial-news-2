German 10-year bond yields were four
basis points from a record low as investors sought safety amid
speculation  Greece  is moving closer to an exit from the euro.  The extra yield, or spread, investors demand to hold
Spanish 10-year bonds instead of benchmark German debt widened
to a euro-era record of more than 5 percentage points after
Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said  Spain  faces being shut out of
financial markets.  Germany  attracted bids equivalent to 1.5
times the amount on offer at today’s auction even with a record
low yield. French 10-year bonds erased declines after the nation
sold bills. Irish two-year notes slumped for a ninth day.  “The flight-to-quality sentiment is supporting bunds,”
said  David Schnautz , a fixed-income strategist at Commerzbank AG
in London. “The current yield level is no hurdle for bunds as
capital preservation is the name of the game.”  German 10-year yields  were little changed at 1.47 percent
at 11:53 a.m.  London  time, near the 1.434 percent level reached
on May 14, which was the least on record. The 1.75 percent
security due July 2022 traded at 102.61 percent of face value.  The yield may drop to less than 1.4 percent today,
Commerzbank’s Schnautz said. Median predictions in Bloomberg
surveys of economists are for the yield to end 2012 at 2.25
percent and rise to 2.35 percent in March.  Bund Returns  German debt has returned 2.6 percent this year, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish bonds lost 3.8 percent,
the data show. French bonds made 2.8 percent.  The Spanish 10-year yield premium over bunds climbed as
much as 19 basis points to 507 basis points. The Italian-German
spread jumped as much as 17 basis points to 457 basis points,
the most since Jan. 19.  Greece is headed for new elections after the inconclusive
May 6 vote pushed Syriza, which opposes the nation’s
international bailout, into second place and reignited concern
that the country will renege on pledges to cut spending as
required by its two aid packages worth 240 billion euros ($305
billion).  Greece’s 2 percent security maturing in February 2023
declined for a 12th day, pushing the yield up by 98 basis points
to 30.38 percent. That left the price at 13.54 percent of face
value. The yield exceeded 30 percent for the first time since
the nation’s debt restructuring in March. Irish two-year yields
jumped 55 basis points to 6.84 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
