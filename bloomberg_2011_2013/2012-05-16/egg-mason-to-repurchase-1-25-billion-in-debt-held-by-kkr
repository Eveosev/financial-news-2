Legg Mason Inc. (LM)  said it will
repurchase $1.25 billion in convertible senior notes held by a
fund managed by KKR & Co. to reduce its total debt.  The plan will result in a non-cash expense of $70 million
to $80 million in the fiscal first quarter, the Baltimore-based
firm said today in a statement. Legg Mason, which said its board
authorized an additional $1 billion in share buy backs, rose 4.2
percent to $23.31 today in  New York  after announcing the plan.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
