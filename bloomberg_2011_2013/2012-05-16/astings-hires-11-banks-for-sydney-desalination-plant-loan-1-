Eleven lenders will provide A$1.6
billion ($1.6 billion) of debt to help Hastings Funds Management
Pty and  Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan  lease the Sydney
Desalination Plant from  Australia ’s New South Wales state.  The loan will be split into facilities that mature in three
and five years, according to Lisa Henderson, Hastings’
Melbourne-based director of marketing and communications. The
banks aren’t expected to sell the debt in syndication, Henderson
said, declining to name the lenders.  Hastings and Ontario Teachers won the right to a 50-year
lease for the water treatment plant, the pipeline, the site and
a same-length supply agreement with Sydney Water for A$2.3
billion earlier this month, Hastings said on May 11. The deal is
part of Australia’s most populous state’s plan to raise funds
for infrastructure projects and debt repayment.  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., Bank of Tokyo-
