The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of
24 commodities fell 0.4 percent to 633.40 at 4:22 p.m.  New York 
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials was up
0.1 percent to 1,494.425.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell to the lowest level in more than six months as
U.S. supplies grew to the most since 1990 and talks to form a
coalition government in  Greece  collapsed, raising concern that
Europe’s debt crisis will worsen.  Crude oil for June delivery fell $1.17, or 1.2 percent, to
$92.81 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest
settlement since Nov. 2. Prices have fallen 15 percent since
closing at the 2012 high of $109.77 a barrel on Feb. 24.  Brent oil for June settlement slipped 53 cents, or 0.5
percent, to expire at $111.71 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures  Europe  exchange. The more-actively traded July futures
retreated $1.70, or 1.5 percent, to $109.75.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures advanced to the highest level in almost
12 weeks as predictions of rising temperatures signaled
increased demand for the fuel to run air conditioners.  Natural gas for June delivery rose 11.8 cents to $2.618 per
million British thermal units on the Nymex, the highest
settlement price since Feb. 23. Futures have narrowed the loss

the lowest intraday price in more than a decade.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline slid to a three-month low after the Kyodo News

oil reserves amid rising crude supplies and concern that
Europe’s debt crisis threatens fuel demand.  Gasoline for June delivery fell 2.32 cents, or 0.8 percent,
to $2.9209 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the

4.  June-delivery heating oil fell 3.54 cents, or 1.2 percent,
to settle at $2.8976 a gallon, the lowest settlement since Dec.
28. Prices have lost 1.3 percent this year.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold, on the brink of a bear market, declined for a fourth
straight session as concern that Greece will have to leave the
euro boosted the dollar and cut the metal’s appeal as an
alternative asset. Silver, palladium and platinum all retreated
as well.  Gold futures for June delivery fell 1.3 percent to settle
at $1,536.60 on the Comex in New York. The settlement leaves

1.2 percent to $594.10 an ounce. Platinum futures for July

that slowing growth in China and Greece’s possible exit from the
euro zone point to lower demand for the metal.  Copper futures for July delivery slid 1.1 percent to settle
at $3.478 a pound on the Comex in New York. Prices dropped for a
fourth straight session, the longest slump since February, and
are down 9.2 percent this month.  GRAINS  Wheat rose the most since March on speculation that hot,
dry weather will curb production in  Kansas , the biggest U.S.
