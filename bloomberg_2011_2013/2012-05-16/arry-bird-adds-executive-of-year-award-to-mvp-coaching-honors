Larry Bird  was named the National
Basketball Association’s Executive of the Year, the first person
to win that honor as well as the Most Valuable Player and Coach
of the Year awards.  Bird, the president of basketball operations for the
 Indiana Pacers , was chosen after his team went 42-24 during the
lockout-shortened regular season.  Bird named Frank Vogel the Pacers’ coach, removing an
interim tag, last July. He signed David West in December and
traded for reserves Lou Amundson and Leandro Barbosa. The result
was a second-place finish behind the  Chicago Bulls  in the
Central Division. Indiana was 37-45 in 2010-11.  The 55-year-old Bird received 12 first-place votes in
balloting of executives from the NBA’s 30 teams, topping runner-
up R.C. Buford of the San Antonio Spurs, the league said in a
news release.  The Pacers beat the Orlando Magic in five games in an
opening-round playoff series. They’re tied 1-1 with the Miami
Heat in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinals.  Bird, who was enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame in
1998, was named the league’s MVP from 1984 to 1986 with the
 Boston Celtics . He won top coaching honors with the Pacers in
1998.  Red Auerbach, Frank Layden and Pat Riley are the only other
people to have been named both Coach of the Year and Executive
of the Year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
