PBG SA (PBG) , Poland’s third-largest
construction company, tumbled to a three-week low after posting
a net loss in the first quarter.  The shares declined as much as 8.2 percent to 21.16 zloty,
the weakest level since the builder started trading on the
Warsaw Stock Exchange in 2004. It traded 5.7 percent lower at
21.75 zloty as of 13:19 in Warsaw, valuing the company at 313
million zloty ($91 million). The stock has slumped 69 percent
 this year , underperforming the  WIG20 Index (WIG20) , which slid 2.8
percent.  PBG reported a net loss of 60.5 million zloty in the first
quarter, compared with a 24.1 million-zloty profit a year
earlier, the company said in a statement yesterday. It
attributed the loss to lower-margin road-building contracts.  “The results are very negative,” Piotr Nawrocki, a
Warsaw-based analyst at Wood & Co. Financial Services AS wrote
in a research note to clients today. “Management has to
accelerate the clean up of its balance sheet of non-core assets
and close unprofitable contracts as the still-growing debt is
not good for restructuring.”  The company will soon resume talks with Spain’s  Obrascon
Huarte Lain SA (OHL)  on the sale of some of its units, including
engineering company  Hydrobudowa Polska SA (HBP) , Chief Executive
Officer and the main shareholder Jerzy Wisniewski said at a news
conference today. PBG will publish a “conservative” forecast
for 2012-2013 in June, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
