Taiwan  resumed oil imports from  Iran 
in March after ceasing purchases a month earlier, according to
data from Ministry of Economic Affairs.  The island nation bought 95,581 barrels a day from Iran in
March, data from the  Bureau of Energy  under the ministry showed.
Taiwan’s March purchases amounted to three times the 31,935
barrels a day it bought in January and the 30,247-barrel average
in 2011.  Iranian crude imports declined 2 percent to 43,440 barrels
a day in the first quarter, according to the data. CPC Corp.,
Taiwan’s state-run refiner, plans to stop importing oil from the
Persian Gulf nation in July because of U.S.-led sanctions,
company President Lin Maw-wen said March 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
