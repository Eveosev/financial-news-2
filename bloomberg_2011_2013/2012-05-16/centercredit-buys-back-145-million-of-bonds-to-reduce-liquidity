Bank Centercredit (CCBN) , the Kazakh lender
part-owned by  South Korea â€™s Kookmin Bank, bought back about $145
million of its bonds due 2014.  Centercredit purchased the notes at a May 11 auction
organized by VTB Capital, paying $1,042.5 apiece, the Almaty-
based lender said in a statement e-mailed today.  The purchases helped to cut excessive liquidity in foreign
currency and reduce debt-servicing costs, Chief Executive
Officer Vladislav Lee said in the statement.  The 8.625 percent dollars bonds were issued in January 2007
and had $477 million outstanding before the tender, Centercredit
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
