Trafigura Beheer BV, the world’s
third-biggest independent oil trader, and Mercuria Energy Group
Ltd. rented fuel-oil storage in  Singapore  from Royal Vopak NV
after Westport Petroleum Inc. ended its contract for the space,
according to four people with knowledge of the deals.  Trafigura leased as much as 100,000 cubic meters of storage
in the Sebarok terminal, according to two of the people. The
contract is for a period of more than two years starting this
month, one of them said. Mercuria is renting about 90,000 cubic
meters, according to an official at the Geneva-based company who
declined to be identified.  A external spokeswoman for Trafigura in Singapore declined
to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News. An official at
Vopak in the city also declined to comment.  Vopak’s Sebarok terminal has a total storage capacity of
1.26 million cubic meters, according to the company’s  website .
Alex Plantilla, an official at Westport in  Pasadena ,  California ,
didn’t return a phone message left at his office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
