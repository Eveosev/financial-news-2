Suedzucker AG (SZU)  won European Union
approval to buy a stake in U.K. sugar trader ED&F Man Holdings
Ltd. after it agreed to sell ED&F’s share of  Italy ’s biggest
sugar refinery.  Suedzuecker will sell ED&F Man’s shareholding in the plant
in Brindisi as a condition of EU authorization for the $225
million deal. The move eliminates EU concerns over competition
in the supply of refined sugar to the Italian food and drink
industry, the European Commission said in an e-mailed statement
today.  “The current high prices and scarcity of sugar across the
EU make it all the more important to maintain competition on the
already concentrated European sugar markets,” the EU’s
antitrust chief,  Joaquin Almunia , said in the statement.  Suedzucker, which makes sugar, starch and bakery additives,
last year agreed to buy the stake of 25 percent minus one share
in London-based ED&F Man to widen access to markets outside
 Europe .  Suedzuecker, based in Mannheim, and ED&F “welcome the
commission’s decision” and are “prepared to accept that ED&F
Man will give up its interest in a sugar refinery in Italy,”
according to an e-mailed statement from Suedzuecker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
