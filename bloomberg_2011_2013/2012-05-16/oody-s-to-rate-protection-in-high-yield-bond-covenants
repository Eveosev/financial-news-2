Moody’s Investors Service (MCO)  plans to
begin grading the covenants of high-yield bonds based on how
much protection investors get from the securities’ terms.  Each junk bond’s agreements will be scored on a one-to-five
scale based on the rules for leverage, subordination and
additional debt, according to an e-mailed statement from the New
York-based firm. Moody’s said it plans to create an index that
tracks covenant quality.  The scores will be separate from Moody’s credit ratings,
according to the statement.  Speculative grade or high-yield bonds are rated below Baa3
by Moody’s and lower than BBB- by Standard & Poor’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
