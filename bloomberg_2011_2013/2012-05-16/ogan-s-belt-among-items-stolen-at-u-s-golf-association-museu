A replica of Ben Hogan’s 1953 Hickok
Belt and the  U.S. Amateur Trophy  were stolen from the U.S. Golf
Association museum, officials said.  The burglary occurred overnight at the museum, which is
located at the association’s headquarters in Far Hills, New
Jersey.  “This is a deplorable incident, but we are thankful for
the safety of our staff,” the association said today in a news
release. “These historical artifacts are an important part of
our collection and their loss is a great disappointment.”  The  Hickok Belt  was a trophy given to top professional
athletes from 1950 to 1976, as voted by sportswriters. It will
be presented again in October for the  first time  in 36 years,
according to the award’s website.  The burglary happened five days after several golf trophies
and three golf carts were stolen from Somerset Hills Country
Club in nearby Bernardsville,  New Jersey , according to a
Bernardsville Police Department report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
