The pound weakened the most in a
month against the dollar after the  Bank of England  cut its
growth forecasts and said the U.K. economy is likely to remain
“subdued.” Gilt yields dropped to records.  Sterling fell versus 13 of its 16 major peers as Governor
 Mervyn King  said at a press conference releasing the central
bank’s quarterly Inflation Report that the U.K. faced threats
from the euro region’s “storm.” Five- and 10-year gilt yields
dropped to all-time lows as King’s comments added to speculation
policy makers will resume their program of bond purchases, or
quantitative easing, which they halted this month.  “The pound is lower given King’s concerns over the euro-
zone fallout and the possible negative impact on the U.K.
economy,” said  Neil Jones , head of European hedge-fund sales at
Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in London. “There were certainly no
signs of further QE being off the table.”  The pound fell 0.4 percent to $1.5923 at 4:38 p.m.  London 
time after dropping as much as 0.7 percent, the biggest decline
since April 13. It earlier reached $1.5889, the lowest since
April 17. Sterling slid 0.4 percent to 79.88 pence per euro.  The U.K. currency depreciated for a second day versus the
greenback as the central bank said gross-domestic-product growth
would be about 2.6 percent a year in two years. The Bank of
England publishes its quarterly predictions in the form of fan
charts without specifying exact numbers.  ‘Disorderly Resolution’  “Concerns about the possibility of a disorderly
resolution” in the euro area have “adversely influenced asset
prices, bank funding costs and confidence,” the central bank
said in the report.  The pound was the second-worst performer today among the 10
developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes, dropping 0.3 percent.  The yield on the benchmark  10-year gilt  fell two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.87 percent after dropping
to a record low 1.821 percent. The 4 percent bond maturing in
March 2022 gained 0.21, or 2.10 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 118.975.  The  five-year yield  declined as much as seven basis points
to a record 0.851 percent, while two-year yields slid five basis
points to 0.342 percent, the lowest since Jan. 30.  Gilts have returned 0.2 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. U.S. Treasuries gained 1.1
percent, and German bunds rose 2.6 percent.  Jobless Claims  The pound pared losses after a government report showed
claims for  unemployment benefits  unexpectedly dropped.  Jobless claims fell by 13,700 in April, the most since July
2010, to 1.59 million, the  Office for National Statistics  said
in London. The median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg News
survey was for an increase of 5,000.  The pound’s recent decline against the dollar may spur
traders to trim bets the U.K. currency will strengthen,
according to Bank of America Corp.  Futures traders added to positions betting sterling will
appreciate versus the greenback to 25,339  contracts  last week,
the most since May 2011, figures from the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission show. They now may “be forced to reduce,”
driving the pound down toward its 200-day moving average of
$1.5830,  MacNeil Curry , a technical strategist at Bank of
America Merrill Lynch, wrote in a note to clients.  “This is a market that in certain respects has defied
gravity,” Curry said yesterday. “This thing has rallied quite
significantly. People have gotten longer and longer. That just
makes it vulnerable.” Long positions are bets that an asset
will rise.  -- With assistance from John Detrixhe in  New York . Editors:
