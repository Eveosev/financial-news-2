Cattle futures rose to a six-week
high on signs that slaughterhouses are boosting purchases to
meet rising demand for U.S. beef. Hog prices climbed.  Meatpackers processed 377,000 head of cattle in the first
three days of this week, up 1.9 percent from a week earlier,
while wholesale  beef  climbed 0.3 percent yesterday to $1.9161 a
pound, the highest since March 19, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show. Demand is increasing before the Memorial
Day holiday on May 28, when many Americans grill outdoors, said
Lawrence Kane, a market adviser at Stewart-Peterson Group.  “We are approaching Memorial Day weekend, which is a good
beef weekend,” Kane said in a telephone interview from  Yates
City ,  Illinois . “There’s some optimism there that we’re going
to get some beef moved.”  Cattle futures for August delivery rose 0.2 percent to
settle at $1.1895 a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, after reaching $1.191, the highest for a most-active
contract since March 30. Prices are down 2.1 percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement advanced 0.4
percent to $1.58325 a pound in  Chicago .  Hog futures for June settlement rose 0.1 percent to settle
at 86.5 cents a pound in Chicago. The commodity has gained 2.6
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
