India  set up a $2 billion currency
swap arrangement to allow South Asian nations easier access to
foreign currency funding, the  Reserve Bank  of India said.  The swap facility will be funded entirely by India and
enable the central banks of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan,
Maldives, Nepal,  Pakistan  and  Sri Lanka  to borrow funds in
dollars, euros and Indian rupees, the RBI said in a statement
today. Governor Duvvuri Subbarao made the announcement at a
meeting of South Asian central bank officials in Nepal, it said.  The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation,
 SAARC , has been working toward greater economic collaboration
and enhancing a free-trade pact adopted in 2004. The decision
for a swap arrangement, “intended to provide a back stop line
of funding” to meet any balance of payment and liquidity
crisis, was made in 2009, when foreign currency flows dried up
amid the global credit crunch, the RBI said.  “The fund is more an initiative to take leadership in the
South Asian region since India is the largest economy,” said
Sujan Hajra, chief economist at Anand Rathi Financial Services
Ltd. in Mumbai. “The amount in itself isn’t big.”  Under the arrangement, member nations can withdraw dollars,
euros and rupees for a period of three months at an interest
rate of 200 basis points above the London interbank offered
rate, or Libor, which can be rolled over twice. The second
rollover will attract an additional interest of 50 basis points,
the  statement  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
