Tanzania,  Africa ’s fourth-largest tea
producer, may boost output to a record next year after a new
factory is built, the Tanzania Tea Board said.  Production of the leaves may increase to 36 million
kilograms (79 million pounds) in the 12 months through June 30,
2013, from 34 million to 35 million kilograms this fiscal year,
Director-General Mathias Assenga said today by phone from  Dar es
Salaam , the commercial capital. A new factory is being built in
southern Tanzania with the capacity to process 1.5 million
kilograms of tea a year, he said.  “It is supplies from this factory which may boost output
because production factors may remain the same next season,”
Assenga said.  Tanzania’s tea output ranks behind Kenya, Malawi and Uganda
on the continent, according to the United Nations’ Food and
Agricultural Organization. Four-fifths of the leaves are sold to
buyers from the U.K., Germany, India and the United Arab
Emirates. Tanzania’s previous record crops was 35 million
kilograms in the 2007-08 season, Assenga said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
