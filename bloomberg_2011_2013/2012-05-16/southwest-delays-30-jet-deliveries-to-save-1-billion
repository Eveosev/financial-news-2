Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV)  deferred
deliveries of 30  Boeing Co. (BA)  737-800 jets by about four years, as
the largest discount carrier extends a cap on fleet size and
works to curb rising costs until it hits financial targets.  “We’re more conservative right now in our ambitions with
respect to expansion,” Chief Executive Officer  Gary Kelly  said
today, following the company’s annual shareholder meeting.
“Right now we’re very focused on hitting our profit target.
We’ll have plenty of aircraft in future years to be able to grow
the airline.”  The deferrals will save more than $1 billion in  capital
spending  as the airline continues efforts to hold down costs and
remain  profitable  while offering discount fares. Even though
 travel demand  is “really strong across the board,” Southwest
wants to slow growth until it hits a goal of 15 percent return
on invested capital, the CEO said.  “It’s just not the kind of environment I’m willing to be
aggressive in terms of increasing our fleet next year,” Kelly
said.  Southwest is delaying 20 deliveries that had been set for
next year, and another 10 scheduled for 2014. Half of those
aircraft instead will arrive in 2017 and half in 2018, the
Dallas-based airline said today.  As a result, Southwest will receive 20 737-800s in 2013 and
24 in 2014, along with five 737-700s. It is adding 34 737-800s
to its fleet this year while retiring a similar number to end
2012 with about 692 planes.  Trimming Spending  Kelly has told employees they needed to be diligent in
increasing efficiency and trimming spending as competitors
narrowed Southwest’s historic unit cost advantage.  “We have to work with our employees in a forward-looking
way to find ways that we can beat every competitor on costs,”
he said. “We need to beat them in every way.”  Southwest rose 1.7 percent to $8.21 at the  New York  close.
The shares of the fourth-largest U.S. airline have tumbled 32
percent in the past year, trailing the 14 percent slide for the
10-carrier  Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index. (BUSAIRL)   The airline also raised its quarterly dividend to 1 cent a
share, from 0.45 cent, to be paid June 20 to stock holders of
record as of June 6. The dividend, the only one paid by any
major U.S. carrier, had been projected to stay unchanged,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Southwest added $500 million to an existing stock buyback
program, bringing the total to $1 billion. The carrier already
has spent $325 million of the initial authorization, said Chief
Financial Officer Laura Wright.  Southwest in December agreed to buy 208 Boeing 737s with a
list value of $19 billion, the largest aircraft order ever and
the first to include the more fuel efficient MAX model. The deal
also included options for another 150 planes.  Boeing had 1,530  unfilled orders  for the 737-800 through
April, the most of any aircraft, according to its website. The
Chicago-based planemaker has 345 pending 737  orders  with
Southwest.  To contact the reporters on this story:
