Suzano Papel & Celulose SA slumped to
the  lowest  in almost nine years after  Brazil ’s second-largest
pulp producer said it plans to sell new shares to reduce debt
and reinforce cash.  Suzano fell 1.9 percent to 6.36 reais in  Sao Paulo , the
lowest close since July 2003. Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa stock
index slipped 0.6 percent.  The company plans to sell as many as 247.9 million voting
and non-voting new shares and raise about 1.62 billion reais
($809 million),  Salvador , Brazil-based Suzano said in a
preliminary prospectus late yesterday.  Suzano will use proceeds to pay some debt and reinforce its
cash position after  debt climbed  to a seven-year high in the
first quarter. Net debt rose to 4.8 times earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, the
highest since the first quarter of 2005, according to the latest
available information on the company’s website.  The pulpmaker also received a bank loan of 2 billion reais
from  Banco BTG (BBTG11)  Pactual SA, according to a separate filing
yesterday. Banco BTG is the financial adviser on the share sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
