Spain faces being shut out of
financial markets unless lawmakers back his proposed deficit
cuts, Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  told Parliament today.  “There is a serious risk that they don’t lend to us or
that they lend to us at astronomical prices,” he told lawmakers
in  Madrid . “All the measures we are currently taking are to
lift us out of a pit.”  The extra yield investors demand to hold Spanish debt
instead of German bonds widened to a euro-era record of 5.07
percentage points amid investors’ concern about banks’ bad
assets and a possible Greek exit of the euro area.  The yield on Spain’s benchmark 10-year bond rose 13 basis
points to 6.48 percent, compared with less than 5 percent early
March, before Rajoy’s People’s Party government said the country
will miss its 2012 budget deficit target.  Euro finance ministers have since agreed to a new goal for
 Spain  this year, at 5.3 percent of gross domestic product
instead of 4.4 percent, as the nation faces its second recession
since 2009. The shortfall last year was 8.5 percent, compared
with a 6 percent target.  In exchange, Rajoy has pledged to cut the deficit to the EU
limit of 3 percent next year, as initially planned. His 2012
budget presented in March included the deepest austerity
measures in more than three decades, raising taxes and reducing
spending to save around 27 billion euros ($34 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
