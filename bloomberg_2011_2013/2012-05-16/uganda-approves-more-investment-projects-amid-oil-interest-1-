Uganda  licensed 62 investment
projects worth $806.6 million in the first quarter, amid growing
interest in the East African nation’s oil industry, Uganda
Investment Authority Chairman Patrick Bitature said.  The number increased from 78 projects worth $604 million
that were approved a year earlier, Bitature told reporters today
in Kampala, the capital. Of the total licensed in the first
three months of 2012, 32 projects worth $708 million were owned
by Ugandans, he said.  “The energy, oil and water sectors recorded the highest
value of planned investment from four projects, followed by
mining, real estate and business services,” he said, without
providing further details.  Uganda is on the cusp of an oil boom with  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) 
expected to start commercial production later this year. Output
from the Ugandan fields, which hold an estimated 2.5 billion
barrels of oil, is expected to reach more than 200,000 barrels
of oil a day, the London-based company said in March.  Sweden was the leading source of planned foreign direct
investment in the first quarter, followed by Lebanon, the U.K.,
Trinidad & Tobago and  Pakistan , Bitature said.  Licenses issued for electricity, gas and water projects in
were worth $561.9 million, while mining and quarrying was $99.9
million, according to a statement from the authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
