Russia  cut the euro’s share in its
international  reserves  to 42.1 percent as of Jan. 1, 2012, down
from 43.1 percent a year earlier, the central bank said.  The U.S. dollar’s share was increased to 45.5 percent from
45.2 percent, while the Canadian dollar’s portion was raised to
1.6 percent from 0.8 percent, according to the central bank’s
annual report submitted to the lower house of parliament and
obtained by Bloomberg. The British pound accounted for 9.2
percent at the end of 2011, compared with 9.3 percent a year
earlier, while the yen made up 1.6 percent of the total,
unchanged from 2010.  With $523 billion in reserves, the world’s fourth largest,
Russia sought to diversify its holdings by adding the Canadian
dollar to the stockpile in 2010, boosting gold purchases and
planning to expand into the Australian dollar.  The sovereign credit grades of euro members are under
pressure, eroding the common currency’s appeal, as policy makers
struggle to rein in government debt levels while growth slows
and joblessness mounts. The  International Monetary Fund  said
Dec. 30 that the greenback’s share of global foreign-exchange
reserves rose in the third quarter by the most since 2008.  As in 2010, Russia also held a small amount of assets
denominated in Swiss francs, according to the central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
