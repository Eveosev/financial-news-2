     (Corrects name of television station in first paragraph.)  Poland’s zloty could suffer some
“significant” weakening in the event of  Greece ’s uncontrolled
exit from the euro area, although the currency would rebound
once investors’ concern dissipates, Finance Minister  Jacek
Rostowski  said today in an interview on TVN24.  The “key question” is whether a Greek pullout from the
single currency would be controlled, Rostowski said.  “We have to avoid a domino effect if Greece exits the
euro,” Rostowski said. “That is our main postulate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
