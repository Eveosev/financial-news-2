Yuan  forwards declined to the weakest
level this year as  Greece ’s failure to form a coalition
government sapped demand for emerging-market assets.  New elections in Greece may be scheduled as early as June
10 after President Karolos Papoulias couldn’t broker a governing
coalition, increasing investor concern that the nation will exit
from the euro. Chinese financial institutions’  yuan positions 
accumulated from sales of foreign exchange to the central bank
dropped 61 billion yuan ($9.6 billion) to 25.6 trillion yuan in
April, official data showed yesterday.  “We are in that Greek cathartic moment now, in which
there’d be a lot of risk-off trading,” said Cliff Tan, East
Asian head of global currency research at Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in  Hong Kong . The yuan positions data
reflects there’s “capital outflows,” he said.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards declined 0.32 percent
to 6.3938 per dollar as of 4:53 p.m. in Hong Kong, the biggest
drop in more than two months, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The contracts are at the weakest level since Dec. 29,
trading at a 1.1 percent discount to the onshore spot rate.  The yuan declined 0.06 percent to close at 6.3222 per
dollar in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. It reached 6.3280 earlier, the weakest level since
March 21. One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-
rate swings used to price options, climbed 37 basis points, or
0.37 percentage point, to 2.32 percent. In Hong Kong’s offshore
market, the yuan dropped 0.10 percent to 6.3255.  The People’s Bank of  China  set the  reference rate  0.15
percent lower at 6.3205. The currency is allowed to trade as
much as 1 percent on either side of the daily fixing.  Economic reports over the past week showed  Europe ’s debt
crisis is slowing growth in the world’s second-largest economy,
with exports, industrial production and new loans missing
analysts’ forecasts. Overseas investment into China dropped for
a sixth month in April to $8.4 billion, the Ministry of Commerce
said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
