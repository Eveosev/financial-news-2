Ambow Education Holding Ltd. (AMBO) , a
Beijing-based education service provider, tumbled after it
delayed filing its annual report and said it may reverse up to
$15 million revenues in 2011 until cash is collected.  Ambow sank 18 percent, the most on record, to $4.65 in  New
York . It earlier declined as much as 27 percent. Trading volume
was more than six times the three-month daily average.  The company is working to complete the audit and expects to
file the annual report within a month, it said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
