A Turkish draft law to extend a
value-added tax on large homes to smaller ones might increase
housing prices in the country by 17 percent,  Vatan newspaper 
reported.  The draft foresees extending the tax of as much as 18
percent to homes smaller than 150 square meters (1,615 square
feet), the newspaper said, citing unidentified Treasury
officials. The Treasury is preparing to send the draft to
parliament for approval, Vatan said.  The existing tax was designed as a levy on luxury home
purchases and was based on size, while the draft law takes into
account the proliferation of luxury-home projects with units
below the size threshhold, Vatan said.  The tax would range from 10 percent to 18 percent,
depending on a homeâ€™s location, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
