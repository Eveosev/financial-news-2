Shares of  Cemex SAB (CEMEXCPO)  fell for the
fourth day in a row, as the European slump and a weaker  Mexican
peso  weighed on the largest cement maker in the Americas.  Cemex, based in Monterrey, Mexico, dropped 1.1 percent to
7.81 pesos as of 12:38 p.m. in Mexico City trading, bringing the
four-day decline to 14 percent, the most since November 2011.  “When you have global risk aversion, you tend to see
investors not invest in companies that have high leverage and a
high exposure to currency risk, and Cemex obviously has both,”
said Benjamin Theurer, an analyst with Barclays Capital in
Mexico City. “Investors are also less keen on investing in
building materials.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
