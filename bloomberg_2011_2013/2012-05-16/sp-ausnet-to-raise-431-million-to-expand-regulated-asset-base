SP AusNet (SPN) , the Australian electricity
distributor 51 percent-owned by Singapore Power Ltd., will raise
$A434 million ($431 million) in a share offer to existing
investors to help fund expansion.  Investors will be offered three shares for every 20 that
they hold at A$1 apiece, the Melbourne-based company said in a
statement. That’s an 11 percent discount to yesterday’s closing
price of A$1.125. Singapore Power will take its 51 percent
entitlement with the balance to be underwritten by  Macquarie
Group Ltd. (MQG)  and  UBS AG (UBSN) , SP AusNet said.  The funds will be used for “significant expansion in the
regulated asset base and other growth opportunities,” SP Ausnet
said in the statement.  SP AusNet manages three electricity and gas transmission
and distribution networks in Victoria state and is currently
upgrading two power terminals, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
