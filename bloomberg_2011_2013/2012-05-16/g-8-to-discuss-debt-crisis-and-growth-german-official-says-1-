Group of Eight leaders will discuss
 Greece , the European debt crisis and spurring growth, a German
government official said.  Talks will include the different path taken by the U.S.
compared to  Europe  in fighting the crisis and its fallout, the
official told reporters in Berlin today on condition of
anonymity because the negotiations are private.  All G-8 countries want to promote growth, the official
said, adding that leaders will probably debate how to boost
demand. There is no sign of heightened concern over Greece, the
official said.  The G-8 will also talk about support for the Arab Spring
countries, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
