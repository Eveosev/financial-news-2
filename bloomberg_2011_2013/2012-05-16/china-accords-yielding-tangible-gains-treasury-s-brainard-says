The Obama administration’s
relationship with  China  is yielding “tangible, significant
gains that will benefit the U.S.,” the Treasury Department’s
top international official said.  Still, commitments made by China, including at talks
between officials of the world’s two largest economies in
Beijing this month, “are not enough,”  Lael Brainard , the
Treasury’s undersecretary for international affairs, said in
testimony for a hearing today before a House Financial Services
Committee panel.  Brainard said agreements at the May 3-4 Strategic and
Economic Dialogue included a pledge by China to reduce tariffs
on consumer goods imports by the end of the year.  China’s decision last month to widen the yuan’s trading
band will help “promote rebalancing and financial reform” if
it’s “implemented in a way that enables the  exchange rate  to
reflect fully market forces,” Brainard said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
