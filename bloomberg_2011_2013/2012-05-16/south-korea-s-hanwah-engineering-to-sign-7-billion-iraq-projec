Iraq  will soon sign a $7 billion
agreement with  South Korea ’s Hanwah Engineering & Construction
Corp. to build 100,000 housing units in the country, the
chairman of Iraq’s National Investment Commission said.  “The signing will be final and the work will start after
that, the value of the deal is more than $7 billion,” said Sami
al-Araji in a telephone interview in Baghdad yesterday.  The commission is also due to sign a contract with Bloom
Properties, a United Arab Emirates-based real estate developer,
to build 40,000 houses in Iraq’s southern province of Karbala.
He didn’t disclose the value of the contract.  Iraq is currently in talks with international companies to
build infrastructure projects valued at a total of about $100
billion, Abdulla Al-Bander, an adviser to the investment
commission, said by phone yesterday. The commission has already
awarded infrastructure projects valued at a total $32 billion
since 2008, he said.  Iraq, which holds the world’s fifth-largest oil reserves,
is seeking foreign investment to help rebuild an economy and
infrastructure damaged by years of conflict, sanctions and
underinvestment. In March 2010, the government approved plans to
build 1 million apartments by 2014 for lower- and middle-income
families to help a housing shortage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
