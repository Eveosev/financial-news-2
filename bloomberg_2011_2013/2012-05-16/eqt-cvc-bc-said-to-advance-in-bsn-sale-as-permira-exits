EQT Partners AB and the duo of BC
Partners Ltd. and CVC Capital Partners Ltd. have advanced in the
bidding for German bandages-supplier BSN Medical, one of the
largest assets being sold by a financial investor in  Germany 
this year, according to people familiar with the matter.  Permira Advisers LLP and ConvaTec Inc., the wound-treatment
maker owned by Nordic Capital Svenska AB and Avista Capital
Partners LLC, are out of the running, said the people, who
declined to be identified because talks are private. An
unidentified trade company may also still be in the process, the
people said.  A sale of the Hamburg-based medical equipment company,
which may fetch 1.5 billion euros to 2 billion euros ($2.5
billion), would end six years of ownership by Montagu Private
Equity LLP, a London-based firm. Montagu, which manages a 2.5
billion euro buyout fund and split from HSBC Holdings Plc. in
2003, has tried to dispose of the German medical equipment
company at least twice in the last four years.  Spokesmen for the private equity firms EQT, Permira, CVC,
Montagu and BC declined to comment. A representative of ConvaTec
couldn’t be reached immediately.  Montagu bought BSN in 2006 for about 1 billion euros,
according to its website. Before the purchase, BSN was a joint
venture of the German personal care company  Beiersdorf AG (BEI)  and
 Smith & Nephew Plc (SN/) ,  Europe ’s biggest maker of artificial hips
and knees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
