President  Barack Obama  awarded the
Medal of Honor to a soldier killed in Cambodia during the
 Vietnam War .  Army Specialist Leslie H. Sabo Jr. of Ellwood,
 Pennsylvania , was honored posthumously for “his heroic actions
in combat” on May 10, 1970, while serving as a rifleman in
Company D, 3rd Battalion, 506th Infantry, 101st Airborne
Division in Se San, Cambodia.  Sabo’s widow, Rose Mary Sabo-Brown and his brother, George
Sabo, joined the president for the ceremony at the White House.
The medal is awarded to members of the armed forces for
gallantry above and beyond the call of duty.  Sabo’s platoon was ambushed by North Vietnamese forces,
according to the account of his actions released by the White
House. He in turn “immediately charged the enemy position,
killing several enemy soldiers.”  Sabo, in a continuing fight, picked up a grenade, threw it
and shielded a wounded comrade with his own body, absorbing the
brunt of the blast. Even though he was wounded, he continued his
assault by crawling toward the enemy emplacement and throwing a
grenade into the bunker.  “The resulting explosion silenced the enemy fire, but also
ended Specialist Sabo’s life,” the White House said in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
