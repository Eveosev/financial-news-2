Stockton, the central California city
on the brink of insolvency, weighed filing for bankruptcy as it
faces a $26 million budget gap in the next fiscal year.  A Chapter 9 bankruptcy filing, massive cuts to city
departments or concessions that may emerge from negotiations
with creditors are among the options for balancing the spending
plan, City Manager Bob Deis told the City Council at a meeting
on the fiscal 2013 budget. Bankruptcy is an option only if the
talks fail, Deis said yesterday.  “The city needs to tighten the belt and start crawling our
way out of this hole,” Deis said.  The farming center about 80 miles (130 kilometers) east of
 San Francisco  is negotiating with creditors under the provisions
of a new state law aimed at helping municipalities avoid
bankruptcy. Unsustainable retiree health-care costs and labor
contracts, large borrowings, the weight of the recession, state
raids on its finances and poor fiscal management brought the
city to this point, Deis said.  In February, the City Council voted to cut its fiscal 2012
budget by $15 million to deal with accounting errors. The
deficit made defaulting on bonds and negotiating with creditors
necessary to prevent insolvency before the year ends on June 30.  It would be illegal for the city not to balance its budget
by July 1, Deis said.  Stockton’s financial practices and reporting are the
subject of an investigation, state Controller John Chiang said
last month. Chiang said he was responding to requests to better
understand the city’s fiscal condition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
