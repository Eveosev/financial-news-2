A Peruvian congressional committee
approved a bill that seeks to increase central bank independence
by preventing the election of its members from coinciding with
presidential elections.  The bill extends the terms of board members to seven years
from the current five, Luis Galarreta, who chairs the economy,
banking and finance committee, said in an e-mailed statement.
One member of the seven-member board would be replaced each year
over a period of seven years, beginning in 2017, he said.  Under the current system the central bank’s six directors
and president are appointed every five years, following the
country’s congressional and presidential elections, which makes
the process vulnerable to political influence, Galarreta said.
The bill will now go to a vote on the floor of the Congress.  “A central bank with sufficient autonomy, independence and
responsibility guarantees the necessary flexibility in monetary
policy to ensure lower inflation,” and “win greater
credibility among economic agents,” Galarreta said today.  President  Ollanta Humala , who took office last July,
appointed three directors to the board on Oct. 3 and ratified
Julio Velarde as bank president to serve a second term. Congress
has yet to name the remaining three directors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
