Central Asia Metals Plc (CAML) , which two
weeks ago began copper output at a project in  Kazakhstan , plans
to ship its first metal next week to a customer in  Turkey .  The company is completing an off-take accord with a trader
to ship the metal, Chief Executive Officer Nick Clarke said in a
phone interview today in London. He declined to name the trader
or the customer because agreements haven’t yet been signed.  Central Asia is planning to produce about 5,000 metric tons
of copper cathode, the finished form of the metal, from a waste
dump at its Kounrad project in Kazakhstan this year and ramp up
to full capacity of 10,000 tons next year, Clarke said.  The producer, which also owns copper, molybdenum and gold
projects in Mongolia, built Kounrad for about $42 million, less
than the $47 million it estimated, Clarke said. The company may
decide by the year-end to commission a second plant in Kounrad,
begin construction of the 10,000 ton-capacity factory in spring
next year and start output at the end of the summer of 2014.  The company, based in  London , is in talks with “a couple
of potential buyers” to sell its gold and molybdenum projects
in Mongolia, Clarke said. “We should have firm offers by the
end of June,” he said. Cutfield Freeman & Co. is advising the
company on the sale, Clarke said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
