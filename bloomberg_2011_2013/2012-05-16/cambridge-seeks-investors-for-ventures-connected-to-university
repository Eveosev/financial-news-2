The University of Cambridge is
seeking to raise 1 million pounds ($1.59 million) to establish a
fund for attracting money to ventures connected to the
institution that might eventually stand on their own.  The fund will be managed by London-based investment firm
 Parkwalk Advisors Ltd.  and advised by  Cambridge Enterprise Ltd. ,
the university’s commercial-development unit, Parkwalk and
Cambridge Enterprise said today in a statement.  The university, in Cambridge,  England , has helped produce
at least nine companies valued at more than $1 billion each,
according to the statement. Two that emerged were semiconductor
designer  ARM Holdings Plc (ARM)  and software maker Autonomy, according
to the statement. ARM’s market value is about 6.7 billion
pounds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Autonomy was
acquired last year by  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  for about $10.3
billion.  “This fund will dramatically increase the university’s
ability to spin out successful companies,” Leszek Borysiewicz,
vice chancellor, said in the statement.  Cambridge Enterprise seed-fund investments have included
Solexa, which was acquired in 2007 by  Illumina Inc. (ILMN) , the San
Diego-based maker of gene-mapping tools. In November 2006,
Illumina agreed to pay about $600 million in stock for Solexa.  “The lack of access to early-stage funding is a major
concern for very young companies,” said Anne Dobree, head of
seed funds at Cambridge Enterprise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
