Power from solar panels is much
closer to price competitiveness with fossil fuel-generated
electricity than many policy-makers and investors realize,
according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Many decision-makers have yet to catch up with the
improvements in the economics of solar power from recent
reductions in the cost of the technology, a working paper
released by the London-based research firm said today.  Global solar installations surged four-fold the past three
years, driven by subsidies and lower technology costs. Average
panel prices have dropped almost 75 percent in the period,
making sun power competitive with daytime retail prices in at
least five major economies including  Germany , the paper said.  This competitiveness is often underestimated because
inadequate metrics are used to compare the costs of different
energy sources. It has major implications for policy and
investment decision-makers, the reportâ€™s authors from seven
organizations and companies said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
