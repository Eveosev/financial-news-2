Egypt ’s military ruler said
presidential elections slated for next week will be free and
transparent, and will yield a “great leader for a great
country.”  Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi’s statement, reported
by the state-run Middle East  News Agency , comes amid concerns by
Islamists and some secular groups that there are attempts to
engineer the return of the ousted regime of  Hosni Mubarak ,
albeit under different leadership.  Two of the leading candidates -- former Arab League chief
Amre Moussa and former premier Ahmed Shafik -- served under
Mubarak. Their main rivals, according to polls by the state-run
Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies, are Islamist
Abdel-Moneim Aboul-Fotouh and Mohamed Mursi, the head of the
Muslim Brotherhood’s political arm.  The ruling generals, in a separate statement, stressed that
they had no designs on power and urged Egyptians to be patient.  Separately, Mohamed Issa, whose candidacy has barely
registered a blip in opinion polls in recent weeks, said he was
throwing his support behind Moussa and urged his supporters to
do the same, according to state television and MENA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
