South African gold mining shares
finished trading less than 0.1 percent higher, having reached a
two-year low after gold entered a so-called  bear market  as bets
that  Greece  may quit the euro eroded the metal’s appeal.  The  FTSE/JSE Africa Gold Mining Index (JGOLD)  slid as much as 3
percent to the lowest since February 2010.  AngloGold Ashanti
Ltd. (ANG) ,  Africa ’s biggest producer of the metal, rose 0.9 percent
to 263 rand, reversing a 3.1 percent decline. Bullion for
immediate delivery slipped as much as 1.1 percent to $1,526.97
an ounce, the cheapest since Dec. 29, before recovering to
$1,542.68 an ounce by 5:05 p.m. in Johannesburg.  Concern about Greece exiting the euro boosted the dollar,
making it more attractive than bullion to some investors. A
second Greek vote will be held, possibly next month, as gridlock
followed a May 6 ballot in which voters rejected the austerity
program that underpins the country’s bailout accords. German
Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  called the new election a
referendum on whether Greece stays in the common currency.  “Commodity prices were unrealistically high as a direct
result of a combination of easy and cheap money from
quantitative easing and the threat of inflation,” Peter Major,
an analyst at Cadiz Corporate Solutions, a unit of Cadiz
Holdings Ltd., said by phone from  Cape Town . “The market is
efficient and it looks ahead. Mining houses have been weak for
four or five months now; investors definitely saw weaker prices
going forward.”  The Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge, climbed for a 13th
day, the longest winning run since its inception. The euro
dropped to $1.2681, the weakest since Jan. 17.  Gold’s earlier retreat took it 20 percent below its all-
time high of $1,921.15, hit on Sept. 5. Spot gold’s so-called
14-day relative strength index dropped to 20.93, below the level
of 30 that some analysts regard as signaling a rebound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
