Madison Square Garden Co. (MSG) ’s
shareholders are winners regardless of how the New York Rangers
fare in the National Hockey League’s Eastern Conference finals.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares the performance of MSG with
 Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC) , its former owner, and the Bloomberg
Americas Entertainment Index since the company was spun off in
February 2010.  Shares of MSG more than doubled after the split as
Cablevision, the fifth-largest U.S. cable-television provider by
subscribers, dropped 21 percent. MSG, based in New York, had the
second-biggest gain among 24 stocks in the Bloomberg index. Only
 Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF)  rose more.  MSG’s sports unit includes the Rangers, who beat the New
Jersey Devils in Game 1 of the conference finals and will play
Game 2 today, and the  New York  Knicks. The National Basketball
Association team made the league’s playoffs and won its first
postseason game since 2001.  “Traditionally, this segment was seen as a wild card,”
Benjamin Mogil, an analyst at Stifel Financial Corp., wrote in a
May 7 report. The unit is now poised to generate cash regularly,
he wrote, as the company finishes a $980 million renovation of
its namesake arena.  Mogil, based in Toronto, raised his MSG rating to buy from
hold on the day of the report. He predicted the stock will rise
to $45 within 12 months. The projection tied him with Albert
Fried & Co.’s Richard Tullo for the highest estimate in a
Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
