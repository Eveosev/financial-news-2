Five cricketers were suspended
pending an inquiry into allegations of spot fixing in Twenty20
matches, the Board of Control for Cricket in  India  said.  The probe follows a sting operation conducted by undercover
TV reporters that alleged players agreed to bowl no-balls and
fix specific events in Indian Premier League matches. Ravi
Sawani, the former head of the International Cricket Council’s
anti-corruption and security unit, will conduct the inquiry.  The cricketers -- T.P. Sudhindra, Mohnish Mishra, Amit
Yadav, Shalabh Srivastav and Abhinav Bali -- are all Indian and
“would not be entitled to participate in any cricket match
played under the aegis of the BCCI while under suspension,”
BCCI President N. Srinivasan said in a  statement  on the
governing body’s website.  Fueled by sponsorships, broadcast revenue and ticket sales,
the IPL has grown into the world’s richest cricket competition,
worth $3.67 billion, according to Brand Finance Plc, a London-
based consultancy firm. The league is in its fifth season.  Last year, Pakistan players Salman Butt,  Mohammad Asif  and
 Mohammad Amir  were jailed in the U.K. after being convicted of
taking bribes to cheat in a Test against  England  at Lord’s in
August 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
