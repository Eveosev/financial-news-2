Angola ,  Africa ’s second-largest oil
producer, will cut its daily crude exports in July to the lowest
in 13 months, according to a preliminary loading program
obtained by Bloomberg News.  Exports will be 51 cargoes, totaling 48.84 million barrels,
or 1.58 million barrels a day, the lowest since June 2011, the
program showed. This compares with 52 cargoes amounting to 1.66
million barrels a day for next month.  The July schedule doesn’t include “any potential Palanca
cargo,” according to the program issued by Sonangol Holdings,
Angola’s state-owned oil company. The country won’t export any
Palanca crude in June, compared with one shipment of 985,000
barrels this month.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  Details of the program are as follows. Cargo sizes are
listed in multiples of 1,000 barrels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
