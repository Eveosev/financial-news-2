Bahrain’s  Interior Ministry  has
released the names and images of 20 people wanted in connection
with the preparation and detonation of homemade bombs that
targeted policemen, the ministry said.  The explosions have resulted in injuries to both civilians
and security personnel and “also caused the spread of fear in
the surrounding communities,” the ministry said in a statement
on its website.  The suspects have evaded arrest and the search for them has
been intensified, it said. Blasts in two Shiite villages last
month injured at least 11 policemen, the Information Affairs
Authority said in a statement in April.  Tensions have simmered in the island nation since the
government cracked down on a month of mass protests last year by
mostly Shiite demonstrators demanding democracy and equal
rights. At least 35 people were killed between Feb. 14 and April
15 last year, according to the Bahrain Independent Commission of
Inquiry, which investigated the unrest. The opposition says more
than 40 other people died from tear gas inhalation and torture.  Small-scale protests still take place daily in Shiite
villages and sometimes spill over into the capital, Manama.  To contact the reporter on this story:
