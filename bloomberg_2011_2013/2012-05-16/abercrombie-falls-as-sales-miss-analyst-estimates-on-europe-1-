Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF) , the teen-
clothing retailer, fell to the lowest price in more than 19
months after reporting first-quarter revenue that missed
analysts’ estimates and saying same-store sales will decline
this fiscal year amid weakness in  Europe .  Abercrombie retreated 12 percent to $40.11 at 9:51 a.m. in
 New York  and traded as low as $39.46, the lowest since Oct. 6,
2010. The  New Albany , Ohio-based company had lost 7 percent this
year through yesterday.  The company reported sales of $921.2 million for the
quarter ended April 28, according to a statement today. While
rising 10 percent from a year earlier, sales missed the $953.7
million average estimate of 27 analysts’  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Abercrombie also said same-store sales will be “down
by a mid-single digit percentage” for the fiscal year instead
of little changed.  “While we are disappointed that European sales trends
remain challenging in a very difficult macroeconomic
environment, we are largely satisfied with our overall
performance for the quarter in that context,” Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Mike Jeffries said in today’s statement.  Abercrombie, which got 20 percent of sales from Europe in
the year ended Jan. 28, is the latest specialty retailer to take
a hit as the region’s economies are roiled by the sovereign-debt
crisis.  Fossil Inc. (FOSL) , owner of the namesake watch brand,  plunged 
38 percent on May 8, the biggest drop since 1995, after cutting
its full-year earnings forecast and citing softness in Europe.  The company reported first-quarter adjusted profit of 3
cents a share, beating the average estimate of 1 cent, and left
its forecast for the year unchanged at $3.50 to $3.75 a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
