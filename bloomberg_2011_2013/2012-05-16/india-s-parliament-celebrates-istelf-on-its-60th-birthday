India's Parliament  turned 60 last week. This landmark in the life of the legislative body of the world's largest democracy was marked by special sessions in both houses of Parliament. Newspapers provided a wealth of fascinating  black-and-white footage  and other archival and  anecdotal  material about the inaugural session on May 13, 1952, almost five years after  India  won its independence. After the country's founding fathers decided that the new Indian state would be a secular democracy, a Constituent Assembly spent those years painstakingly working out the specific forms of the state and the checks and balances it would require. Then, elections to Parliament were held and Parliament convened. The occasion was certainly one that required celebration, particularly since Indian democracy has comprehensively refuted early critics who said it was unsustainable because it started from a much more perilous foundation than the democracies of the West. For all its faults, parliamentary democracy has acquired a stability and currency and history in India, even as it has often faltered in the neighboring states of  South Asia .  The Times of India observed in an editorial : But if the majority of Indian people were less than impressed with the compliments that the current members of Parliament doled out to themselves, it was because, by general consensus, Parliament has in the last decade experienced  something of a crisis . It is commonly perceived today as a body of stasis and an enabler of private interests (some detailed by the journalist P. Sainath in a piece last year called " The Union Cabinet Gets Healthier "), hobbled by partisan squabbles and disrupted repeatedly by boycotts and walkouts.  Facts and figures  collated by political observers prove that this is indeed true, and last year  one prominent Member of Parliament  asked if it would not be more practical for India to move to a presidential form of government. For all its shortcomings, one of the reasons why the septuagenarian  Anna Hazare  attracted such a  wave of support  last year for a movement to pass the anti-corruption  Jan Lokpal Bill  was that his team appeared to have expended more energy on the specifics of such a measure than "the foremost lawmaking body of the land," which had vacillated on it for years. Having been birthed by the idealism and daring of a very liberal idea of what the Indian state and government would be like, Parliament at 60 has become an arena of exhaustion and cynicism at a time when most other spheres of Indian life are rippling with new ideas and energy. In a piece on May 12 called " 60, still shy to speak up " in The Telegraph, Sanjay Jha wrote: But one might that say that Parliament suffers currently from a deficit not just of political morality, but of constitutional morality. In taking an adolescent approach or an inflexible party line towards the complexities of governance and representation in a polity as complex as India's, Parliament has, as the country's most prominent debating chamber, set a bad precedent for debates all around the country. Of course, the problems of hyperpartisanship have immobilized debate in many other prominent arenas of democracy. In their just-published book " It's Even Worse Than It Looks ," the American congressional scholars Thomas E. Mann and Norman J. Ornstein discuss how approval ratings for the  U.S. Congress  are at a historic low because of the breakdown of a working relationship between the Democrats and the Republicans. But one might argue that Parliament in India has had a special responsibility toward itself and the Indian people because of the relative youth of Indian democracy, a matter that greatly exercised the mind of  BR Ambedkar , the prime force behind the text of the Indian Constitution. That is to say, in a country in which caste and community have historically enjoyed greater power than the call of individual reason and a tradition of respect for differences, Parliament was envisaged by the founding fathers as a theatre where the virtues and values of constitutionalism could percolate down to an often obdurate and unreceptive citizenry new to democracy. It is certain that the members of the inaugural gathering of Parliament in 1952 were much more conscious of this responsibility than Parliament today. The point that India has become a "populist democracy" more than a " constitutional democracy " was elegantly argued in a 2008 essay called "Constitutional Morality" by the sociologist Andre Beteille in the Economic and Political Weekly (the piece is restricted to subscribers, but a restatement of its premises  were made by the historian Ramachandra Guha recently here ). This lack of appreciation of constitutional morality has meant that virtually every week in Indian public life there erupts an ugly and sometimes violent fracas -- whether the decision to censor  a book  or  film , or the  protests by Islamic groups  that scuppered Salman Rushdie's visit to the Jaipur Literary Festival, or the  attempts by Hindu right-wing groups  recently to break up a "beef festival" -- in which a group or party behaves as if there was no such frame of rights in India as a Constitution, and acts on injured sentiments or  grievances rooted in readings that go back into the long night of Indian history . These eruptions show that Parliament has not succeeded, to borrow a phrase from President  Barack Obama 's book "The Audacity of Hope," in making the Constitution "a living document" in the minds of Indian people. It is the Constitution that gives Parliament its dignity, but one might say that Parliament has not repaid the favor. In a  special issue of the Indian magazine Seminar  published in 2010 to mark the 60th anniversary of the Constitution, the political scientist Ananya Vajpeyi marked the  liberating power of the Consitution  for "an overly large, unremittingly poor, vexingly diverse and precariously free post-colony like India," and Pratap Bhanu made the very  compelling argument  that for Ambedkar, "the real anxiety was not ‘Constitution’ the noun, as much as the adverbial practice it entailed." Mehta wrote: So one might remind Parliament, flushed with pleasure at 60, of the responsibility it has not just to the present, and to the needs and problems of more than 1 billion people in an era of great churning and change, but also to history and to the narrative of Indian democracy. Sixty is, after all, a time to take the long view of a life. (Chandrahas Choudhury, a novelist, is the New Delhi correspondent for the World View blog. The opinions expressed are his own.)
