Thailand’s baht fell to its weakest
level since January after talks to form a government in  Greece 
failed, spurring investors to the relative safety of the dollar.
 Government bonds  were steady.  New elections may be scheduled as early as June 10 after
President Karolos Papoulias failed to form a coalition following
an inconclusive May 6 vote, threatening pledged spending cuts
required to secure 240 billion euros ($305 billion) in bailouts.
The baht has dropped 2.3 percent this month as global funds
reduced holdings of local shares by $174 million during the
period, exchange data show.  “The Greek issue is making investors risk averse, and that
supports the dollar and other safer assets,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a researcher at the Japan Center for Economic Research
in  Tokyo . “Asian currencies will likely see downward pressure
for the time being.”  The baht lost 0.4 percent to 31.45 per dollar as of 8:27
a.m. in Bangkok, the weakest level since Jan. 26, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency may retreat to about
31.60 over a week, Hayashi said.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of foreign-exchange
swings used to price options, was little changed at 4.52
percent.  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2017 was unchanged at 3.61 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
