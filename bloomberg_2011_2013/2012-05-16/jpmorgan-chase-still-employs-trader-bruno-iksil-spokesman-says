JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  continues to
employ Bruno Iksil, the trader known as the London Whale whose
positions may have distorted prices in some derivatives markets,
according to the company.  Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for the New York-based firm,
confirmed Iksilâ€™s status. The New York Times reported earlier
that Iksil is leaving JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
