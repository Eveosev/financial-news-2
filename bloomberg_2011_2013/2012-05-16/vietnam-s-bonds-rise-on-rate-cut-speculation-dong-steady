Vietnam ’s three-year bonds rose on
speculation the central bank will lower  interest rates  to
support the economy. The dong was little changed.  The government aims to reduce commercial lending rates to
about 15 percent, Lao Dong newspaper reported yesterday, citing
the outcome of a meeting of the National Assembly’s Economic
Commission. The rates are currently as high as 20 percent,
according to data from the central bank. Vietnam’s central bank
cut borrowing costs for the second time in a month on April 10.  “In the second half of this month, we expect the secondary
market to continue to be active as small- and mid-size banks
still have surplus cash to invest in bonds on expectations of
lower yields,” according to a fixed-income report issued by
Viet Capital Securities today. “High probability of further
policy rate cuts by the central bank could drive demand higher
for fixed-income instruments.”  The  yield  on three-year bonds fell six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 9.01 percent, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest level
since June 2009.  The dong traded at 20,853 per dollar as of 4:32 p.m. in
Hanoi, after closing yesterday at 20,850, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank set the currency’s
reference rate at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, its website
showed. The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on
either side of the official fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
