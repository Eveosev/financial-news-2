Qihoo 360 Technology Co. (QIHU) , a Chinese
developer of anti-virus software, will boost this year’s sales
by as much as 85 percent as user-friendly tools attract
advertisers, Chief Financial Officer Alex Xu said.  “Our new products in the second half will help create more
opportunities,” Xu said yesterday in a phone interview from the
company’s Beijing headquarters. “I don’t think it will be a
problem for us to increase revenue by 80 percent to 85 percent
this year,” he said, citing analysts’ estimates.  Qihoo, which also provides computer desktop software, can
weather a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy as it
benefits from rising online advertising revenue after 2011 sales
jumped 191 percent to $167.9 million, Xu said.  American depositary receipts of the Beijing-based company
have  gained  43 percent since its initial public offering in
March 2011, the most among 13 Chinese companies that went public
in the U.S. last year.  Qihoo’s ADRs rose 4.7 percent to $20.72 in  New York 
yesterday, boosting  this year ’s gain to 32 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
