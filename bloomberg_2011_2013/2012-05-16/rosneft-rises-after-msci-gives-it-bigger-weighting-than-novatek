OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s biggest oil
producer, rose for a second day after its weighting in the MSCI
Russia Index was increased.  Rosneft climbed 1.3 to 203.09 rubles by the close in
Moscow, the biggest gain since May 11.  The company became the fourth-biggest Russian stock on the
index with a 6.4 percent  weighting  compared with 4.95 percent
for OAO Novatek, according to an e-mailed copy of MSCI Inc.’s
report. Novatek shares fell 0.7 percent to 328.23 rubles.  The changes will see a “reshuffling” in the MSCI Russia
10/40 gauge which “can trigger outflows of up to $301 million
from Novatek and inflows of up to $542 million into Rosneft,”
VTB Capital analysts led by Alexey Zabotkin wrote in a report
today.  OAO Rostelecom’s weighting was cut to 2.3 percent,
according to the MSCI report. The changes come into effect June
1, according to MSCI.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
