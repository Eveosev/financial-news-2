European Union regulators extended
until Aug. 31 the deadline for their review of  United
Technologies Corp. (UTX) ’s $16.5 billion bid for  Goodrich Corp. (GR) , the
European Commission said in a filing on its website today.  The deadline was extended by the commission with the
agreement of the companies, said Antoine Colombani, a spokesman
for the Brussels-based regulator. He didn’t elaborate on the
reason for the delay.  “Both sides, commission and parties, have agreed to extend
the deadline by 15 working days,” Colombani said in an e-mail.  UTC, which has aviation brands including Sikorsky
helicopters and Pratt & Whitney engines, agreed to buy Goodrich
in September, adding a maker of aircraft landing gear and jet-
turbine casings to take advantage of a record surge in
commercial plane orders.  John Moran , a spokesman for Hartford, Connecticut-based
UTC, and Goodrich, based in  Charlotte , North Carolina, didn’t
respond to e-mails seeking comment on the extension of the EU’s
review.  The EU’s antitrust agency opened an in-depth probe in March
because there were “potential competition concerns” over the
company’s “very high combined market shares” for engine
controls and AC power generators, it  said  at the time. It also
cited possible problems over aftermarket services and the
removal of Goodrich as an independent supplier of fuel nozzles
and engine controls.  To contact the reporter on this story:
