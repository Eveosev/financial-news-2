Brazil’s central bank is unlikely to
sell dollars in the spot market to stem declines of the real,
Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  told O Estado de S. Paulo.  “I don’t think the central bank will do that,” Mantega
said when asked by the Sao Paulo-based newspaper whether the
bank would sell dollars in the foreign exchange market. “I’m
satisfied,” he said in the interview, referring to the current
level of the exchange rate close to 2 reais per  U.S. dollar .  Mantega played down any inflationary pressure that the
weakening real could cause by increasing the cost of imported
goods. “It causes a little bit of concern but increasingly
less,” Mantega said.  Brazil’s economy may not grow 4.5 percent this year as the
government had previously forecast, Mantega told the newspaper.
The expansion will be greater than the 2.7 percent registered in
2011, he told Estado.  Brazil ’s government may cut payroll taxes
for additional industries to boost growth, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
