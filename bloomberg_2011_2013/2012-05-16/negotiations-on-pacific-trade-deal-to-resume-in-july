Negotiations on a Pacific-region
trade agreement will resume in San Diego July 2-10 after talks
this week made progress on reining in enterprises backed by
foreign governments, the top U.S. negotiator said.  “We plan to continue moving full steam ahead and hope to
use that round to make a major step forward” in completing the
deal, known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, chief U.S.
negotiator Barbara Weisel said on a media conference call today.  The nine nations seeking a deal “made better-than-expected
progress” in talks near Dallas that concluded today, she said.
Negotiators will discuss whether other nations should join the
talks while at a regional trade ministers  meeting  next month in
Kazan,  Russia , Weisel said.  The countries working toward an agreement are Australia,
Brunei, Chile, Malaysia,  New Zealand , Peru, Singapore, the U.S.
and Vietnam. Each of those nations also are in discussions with
governments in  Japan ,  Canada  and Mexico, which have expressed
interest in joining, though a final decision hasn’t been made.  Negotiators in Dallas reached an agreement to boost trade
for small- and medium-size businesses, and they had “valuable
exchanges” on a U.S. proposal to ensure that state-owned
enterprises compete fairly with private companies, Weisel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
