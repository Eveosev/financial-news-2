Hwange Colliery Co. (HWANGE) , Zimbabweâ€™s
biggest coal miner, needs $200 million to recapitalize, the
state-controlled  Chronicle  reported, citing Managing Director
Fred Moyo.  The company has spent $15 million rebuilding a coke oven
and is in talks with an Indian investor, the Bulawayo-based
Chronicle said. Hwange exports coal to India, and plans to ship
the commodity and coking coal to neighboring Botswana,
Mozambique, Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of Congo, the
