Yields on  Ecuador ’s 2015 dollar bonds
jumped the most since January as the price of oil fell to the
lowest this year, cutting revenue for the South American
country’s government.  The yield on the country’s 9.375 percent debt due 2015 rose
37 basis points, or 0.37 percentage point, to 9.04 percent as of
12:30 p.m. in Quito, its biggest increase on a closing basis
since Jan. 26, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
price fell 1.12 cents to 100.98 cents on the dollar.  Ecuador has seen the price of its Oriente crude retreat 11
percent this month, pacing losses in markets for oil traded in
New York, amid increasing global supply and concern about
 Europe ’s debt crisis. Lower prices mean less revenue for the
government, which defaulted on $3.2 billion of bonds in 2008 and
2009, Fernando Simo, chief executive officer of Quito-based
brokerage Casa de Valores Produvalores SA, said today.  “It’s clearly because of the fall in the price of oil,”
Simo said in a telephone interview. “The price of one commodity
determines the health and solvency of our economy.”  Ecuador, the smallest member of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, uses oil exports to finance about
41 percent of  government spending , according to the 2012 budget.
The Finance Ministry forecasts a $4.23 billion  budget deficit 
this year, or 16 percent of total spending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
