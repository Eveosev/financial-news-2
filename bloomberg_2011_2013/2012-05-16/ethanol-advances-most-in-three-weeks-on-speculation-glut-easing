Ethanol advanced the most in more
than three weeks on speculation that a supply glut is easing.  Futures rose for a second day after the Energy Department
said  stockpiles  slid 3.5 percent to 20.6 million barrels in the
week ended May 11, the lowest amount since Jan. 27. Production
of  conventional gasoline mixed with the biofuel , a proxy for
demand, climbed 2.4 percent to a record 5.4 million barrels a
day, according to the department.  “Although today’s DOE production numbers did creep above
900 for the first time since early March, ethanol inventories
are much less oversupplied these days,” said Michael Breitenbach, an analyst and trader at Blue Ocean Brokerage LLC
in  New York .  Denatured ethanol for June delivery rose 4.3 cents, or 2
percent, to settle at $2.17 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the highest price since May 8 and the biggest one day
gain since April 19. Ethanol has fallen 1.5 percent this year.  Production expanded 0.8 percent to 904,000 barrels a day
last week, the Energy Department said, the highest level since
March 2.  In spot market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf jumped 5
cents, or 2.3 percent, to $2.205 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive increased 4.5 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $2.135,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in New York added 3.5 cents, or 1.6 percent, to
$2.185 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel gained 1.5
cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
