Sojaprotein AD (SJPT) , the biggest soybean
processor in the Balkans, reported a net loss of 181 million
dinars ($2 million) in the first quarter because of higher raw
material costs and a weaker dinar.  Earnings before interest and tax plunged 71 percent to
118.8 million dinars, the Serbia, Novi Becej-based company,
majority owned by the Victoria Group AD, said in a regulatory
filing to the Belgrade Stock Exchange. Sales rose almost 16
percent to 2.88 billion dinars. The effect of the weak dinar in
the period was in excess of 300 million dinars.  The cost of materials, which accounts for 76 percent of
Soja’s operating costs, rose 20 percent and was the main
negative factor after the currency, said Ivan Dzakovic, a
financial analyst at the Belgrade-based brokerage Sinteza Invest
Group.  “On the other hand, the company is in a new investment
cycle that will increase its profitability in the long-run” and
the “stock is still worth investing,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
