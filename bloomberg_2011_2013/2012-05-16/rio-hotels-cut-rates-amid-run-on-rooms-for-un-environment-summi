Hotels in  Rio de Janeiro  have agreed
to cut prices by as much as 60 percent during a United Nations
environmental summit next month after some delegations reduced
their participation due to the high cost of lodging.  More than 100 heads of state and 50,000 environmental
activists and diplomats are expected to attend the Rio+20  Summit 
taking place June 13-22 to commemorate the UN’s landmark climate
conference in the beachside city two decades ago.  Brazil ’s government, in a statement, said that it
intervened in negotiations with hotel operators after it learned
that some establishments were taking advantage of strong demand
to charge excessive prices.  Under new rules, the travel agency responsible for
organizing the event will renounce its commission and hotels
will lower rates and waive minimum-stay requirements, producing
savings of as much as 60 percent. Delegations that have already
paid will have excess charges returned, the government said.  Rio, the host of the 2016  Summer Olympics , is scrambling to
handle a huge influx of visitors expected to attend next month’s
summit, with the city government planning to establish a
campground in an urban park and encouraging residents to take in
lodgers.  Mayor Eduardo Paes is also considering declaring a public
holiday to ease traffic that will worsen with police-escorted
caravans shuttling Russia’s  Vladimir Putin , France’s  Francois Hollande  and other world leaders expected to be in attendance.  Paes complained about “exorbitant” prices charged by some
hotels after O Globo newspaper reported this month that four and
five-star accommodations in Rio cost an average 1,400 reais
($700) a night during the conference, more than comparable
lodging in  New York  and other major cities.  European governments are reducing the number of delegates
they plan to send to the summit because of the higher hotel
prices, the BBC  reported  in April, citing an interview with a
European Union official in Brazil  To contact the reporters on this story:
