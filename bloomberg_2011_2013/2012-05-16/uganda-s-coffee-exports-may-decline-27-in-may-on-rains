Uganda ’s coffee exports will probably
drop 27 percent from a year earlier in May as an extended rainy
season delays drying of the beans, the country’s Coffee
Development Authority said.  Africa ’s biggest exporter of the crop may ship 180,000 50-
kilogram (110-pound) bags this month, the second-worst level
this season, the authority said today by e-mail from Kampala,
the capital. That compares with 247,460 in May 2011 and 141,220
bags last month, it said.  Uganda may export 3.1 million to 3.2 million bags in
2011-12, according to the authority. This compares with the
forecast of 2.8 million to 2.9 million given by National Union
of Coffee Agribusinesses and Farm Enterprises on May 8.  Shipments from October through April, the seventh month of
the season, rose to 1.34 million bags worth $196.45 million,
from 1.32 million bags worth $176.11 a year earlier, the
authority said.  The nation exported 3.15 million bags worth $448.89 million
in 2010-11, according to the authority. Eastern Africa Fine
Coffee Association says Uganda consumes about 3 percent of its
annual crop.  Uganda was Africa’s biggest coffee exporter and the world’s
ninth-largest in the 12 months through last September, according
to the London-based International Coffee Organization. Robusta
beans, used in espressos and instant drinks, account for about
85 percent of Ugandan production, according to the authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
