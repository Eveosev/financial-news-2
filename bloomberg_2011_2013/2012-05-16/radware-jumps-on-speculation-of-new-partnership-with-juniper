Radware Ltd. (RDWR)  rallied the most in six
months after Oppenheimer & Co. said the company is in advanced
negotiations to license its software to  Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR)   Shares of Radware, an Israeli developer of security
software and cloud-computing technology, jumped 6.8 percent to
$39.73 at the close in New York, the most since Oct. 26.  Radware, based in Tel Aviv, may enter into a deal with
Juniper to license its ADC engine technology, Ittai Kidron, a
New York-based analyst at Oppenheimer, wrote in a May 15
statement. Should the transaction materialize, it could amount
to between $70 million and $100 million over the next three to
five years, Kidron wrote.  Michael Lordi, a spokesman for Radware, declined to comment
on the report in an e-mail to Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
