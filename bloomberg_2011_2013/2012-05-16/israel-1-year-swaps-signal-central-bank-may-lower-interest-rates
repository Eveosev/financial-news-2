Israel ’s one-year  interest-rate swaps 
fell to the lowest level in more than three months and
 government bonds  rose on speculation slowing economic growth
will prompt the central bank to lower borrowing costs.  The contracts, an indicator of investor expectations for
the benchmark interest rate in the next 12 months, dropped one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.39 percent, at 2:41
p.m. in Tel Aviv, matching the low on Feb. 15. The rate
retreated 21 basis points this month. The yield on the 4.25
percent Mimshal Shiklit notes due August 2016 declined one basis
point to 3.32 percent, the lowest on record.  The economy grew an annualized 3 percent in the first
quarter, the slowest pace since the three months ended June
2009, the Jerusalem-based Central Bureau of Statistics said
today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 11
economists was 2.5 percent. The  Bank of Israel , which held the
benchmark  interest rate  at 2.5 percent for a third month on
April 23, will meet to set monetary policy on May 28.  “The growth figure was better than anticipated but there
is still a slowdown in the economy,” said Amir Haik, chief
economist at  Union Bank of Israel (UNON)  Ltd. in Tel Aviv. “A
deterioration in the eurozone economy will impact the country’s
exports and may prompt the Bank of Israel to lower  interest
rates  in the coming months.”  Inflation Forecasts  Greece  called a new election yesterday after its political
parties failed to form a governing coalition in the aftermath of
the inconclusive May 6 vote, raising concern the country will
leave the euro.  Economic growth  in Israel, which exports almost
60 percent of its goods to the euro region and the U.S., is
expected to slow to 3.1 percent this year from 4.8 percent in
2011, according to central bank estimates.  Rafael Gozlan , chief economist at I.B.I.-Israel Brokerage &
Investments Ltd. in  Tel Aviv , reduced his inflation forecast to
1.8 percent in the next 12 months from 2.4 percent, according to
an e-mailed report today.  The one-year break-even rate, the yield difference between
inflation-linked bonds and fixed-rate government bonds of
similar maturity, fell seven basis points to 220, implying an
average annual inflation rate of 2.20 percent, the lowest in
more than three months.  The shekel was little changed at 3.8335 a dollar. The Tel
Aviv Bond 40 Index, a measure of inflation-linked and fixed-rate
corporate bonds, dropped 0.5 percent to 262.03, the lowest level
since Jan. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
