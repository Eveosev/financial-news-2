Brett Lawrie of the Toronto Blue Jays
dropped his appeal of a four-game suspension for throwing a
batting helmet that bounced and struck an umpire.  Lawrie played in last night’s game against the  New York
Yankees  after initially appealing the discipline handed down by
 Major League Baseball . His suspension will begin with tonight’s
home game against the Yankees and continue with a three-game
interleague series against the  New York Mets  in Toronto.  The 22-year-old Lawrie, who was also fined an undisclosed
amount, said his emotions got the better of him after a third
strike called by umpire  Bill Miller  in the ninth inning of the
team’s 4-3 loss to the Tampa Bay Rays on May 15.  Lawrie thought he’d been walked on a full-count pitch with
one out when he was called out by Miller. He dropped his bat,
then shouted and gestured at Miller, who ejected Lawrie from the
game. Lawrie took several steps toward the umpire and threw down
his helmet so hard it ricocheted into Miller’s leg.  “I threw it off the ground, it took a bad hop and it hit
him totally by accident,” Lawrie told reporters yesterday. “I
never meant to throw it at him.”  Lawrie is hitting .281 with three home runs and 17 runs
batted in over 38 games this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
