Presumptive Republican presidential
nominee  Mitt Romney  won the Oregon primary, according to the
Associated Press, following his victory earlier tonight in
Nebraska.  Romney began the day with 973 delegates of the 1,144 needed
for the nomination, according to the AP. The former
Massachusetts governor should surpass the required number later
this month. The presidential primaries wrap up June 26 when Utah
votes.  His last remaining active Republican rival, U.S.
Representative  Ron Paul  of Texas, announced yesterday he won’t
spend more money campaigning in primaries, though he will
continue seeking national convention delegates at state party
gatherings.  With 27 percent of Oregon’s precincts reporting in the AP
tally, Romney had 73 percent of the vote. Paul had 12 percent,
followed by former Senator  Rick Santorum  of Pennsylvania with 9
percent and former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich with 5
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
