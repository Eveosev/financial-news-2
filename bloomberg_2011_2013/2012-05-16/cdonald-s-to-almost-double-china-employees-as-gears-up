McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) , the world’s largest
restaurant chain, will hire 70,000 people in China this year,
almost doubling its workforce there, as it accelerates new store
openings in the Asian nation.  On May 20, all 1,400 McDonald’s stores in China will set up
recruitment tables and invite people to apply for restaurant
positions, Lisa Howard, a company spokeswoman, said in an
interview today.  Oak Brook , Illinois-based McDonald’s first
announced the openings in China yesterday, she said.  McDonald’s has about 80,000 employees in China now, Howard
said. It will open as many as 250 locations there this year,
compared with 200 last year, she said.  The Big Mac seller has sought to compete with  Yum! Brands
Inc. (YUM) ’s KFC and  Pizza Hut  in China by opening more stores there
with drive-throughs and promoting value items during lunch.
McDonald’s, which also offers delivery service in China,
generated about 22 percent of  revenue  from the Asia Pacific,
Middle East and Africa region last year.  The company  rose  0.5 percent to $91.43 at the close in New
York. The shares have lost 8.9 percent this year.  McDonald’s has more than 33,500 restaurants worldwide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
