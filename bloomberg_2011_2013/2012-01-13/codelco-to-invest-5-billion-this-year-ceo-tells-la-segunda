Codelco, the world’s largest copper
producer, will invest $5 billion in 2012, up from $2.3 billion
in 2011,  Diego Hernandez , Codelco’s Chief Executive Officer,
told La Segunda in an interview.  An agreement with  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  in January over the
Anglo Sur unit in central  Chile  is very unlikely, Hernandez told
the Santiago-based evening newspaper. Codelco will not soften
its position, Hernandez said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
