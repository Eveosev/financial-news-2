Naftna Industrija Srbije AD, a
Serbian  oil company  controlled by  OAO Gazprom (GAZP)  Neft, plans to
spend as much as 13 billion dinars ($158 million) to renovate as
many as 250 of its gas stations in the country, the companyâ€™s
chief executive officer said.  Work to overhaul the stations should be complete by 2015,
Kirill Kravchenko told reporters today in Belgrade. The company
operates a network of more than 400 filling stations and are
looking at the profitability of the remaining unrenovated
stations and could either lease them out or sell them, he said.  NIS is 56.15 percent owned by Gazprom Neft and the Serbian
government has a 29.87 percent stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
