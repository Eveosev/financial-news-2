Philip Falcone’s LightSquared Inc.
called for more tests of its proposed wireless service after
U.S. officials said interference with the global-positioning
system precludes quick approval of the venture.  No further testing is warranted after findings that
LightSquared disrupts many GPS receivers, the National Executive
Committee for Space-Based Positioning, Navigation & Timing said
yesterday in a letter to the U.S. Commerce Department. The
inter-agency body advises the government on GPS technology.  The government testing is “unfair and shrouded from the
public eye,”  Terry Neal , a LightSquared spokesman, said in an
e-mailed statement yesterday.  The findings are a setback to LightSquared, which may have
“a couple of quarters at most” before running out of money,
Jonathan Atkin, a San Francisco-based analyst with  RBC Capital
Markets , said in an interview yesterday.  “The days are limited here,” Atkin said. “They would
need to get more financing and it’s not clear that is really
forthcoming from any source.”  U.S. regulators won’t approve LightSquared for commercial
service if they find it would significantly disrupt GPS devices.
The Reston, Virginia-based company plans high-speed wireless
service to as many as 260 million people.  The U.S. Federal Communications Commission granted partial
approval to LightSquared in January 2011, and ordered tests.  ‘Harmful Interference’  Federal agencies unanimously found that LightSquared
“would cause harmful interference to many GPS receivers,”
 Ashton Carter , deputy secretary of defense and John Porcari,
deputy secretary of transportation, said in yesterday’s letter.
That conclusion applies both to LightSquared’s original plan,
and to modifications the company pledged after earlier tests
showed interference, Carter and Porcari said.  “There appear to be no practical solutions or mitigations
that would permit the LightSquared broadband service, as
proposed, to operate in the next few months or years without
significantly interfering with GPS,” Porcari and Carter said.  The letter was sent to Lawrence Strickling, head of the
 National Telecommunications and Information Administration , a
unit of the Commerce Department that’s coordinating the U.S.
review.  The information will be used as the NTIA makes its
recommendation to the FCC, which is to decide whether to approve
LightSquared, Moira Vahey, a spokeswoman for the
telecommunications administration, said in an e-mail.  Air Safety  GPS makers say LightSquared inappropriately plans to send
powerful data signals on airwaves previously reserved mainly for
faint emissions from satellites. They say LightSquared would
disrupt navigation equipment in aircraft, boats, tractors and
automobiles.  LightSquared has said GPS makers should have planned to
accommodate the company’s use of airwaves near those used by GPS
devices. The company proposed operating at lower power levels
after earlier tests showed interference.  Preliminary test results released last month showed that
LightSquared disrupts an air-safety system that helps airliners
avoid crashing into mountains and buildings.  LightSquared wants a new round of tests run by the FCC and
NTIA, Neal said.  Members of an advisory board have “deep ties” to GPS
makers, and the government chose to test “obsolete and off-
market GPS receivers that nearly guaranteed failure,” Neal
said.  Sprint Agreement  Navigation-gear makers and users welcomed the U.S.
officials’ statement, Dale Leibach, a spokesman for the
Coalition to Save Our GPS, a group formed to oppose
LightSquared, said in an e-mail.  “Every set of independent technical studies has confirmed
that LightSquared’s proposed operations would create widespread
interference to critical GPS uses,” Leibach said.  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  on Jan. 5 put a network-sharing
partnership with LightSquared on hold as the companies await
U.S. clearance. A day earlier, Falcone joined FCC officials in a
meeting where LightSquared participants emphasized rules that
call for LightSquared to offer service to at least 100 million
people this year.  LightSquared is backed by $3 billion from Falcone’s
Harbinger Capital Partners hedge fund. LightSquared may need
more money by April,  Jonathan Chaplin , an analyst with Credit
Suisse Group AG, said last month.  LightSquared Chief Executive Officer  Sanjiv Ahuja  in a Dec.
9 interview said the company would be be adequately funded
through the government’s review period.  “We’ll have capital beyond when we expect FCC clearance to
happen,” Ahuja said. “That should be the early part of next
year.”  Tammy Sun, an FCC spokeswoman, didn’t immediately respond
to an e-mail and telephone call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
