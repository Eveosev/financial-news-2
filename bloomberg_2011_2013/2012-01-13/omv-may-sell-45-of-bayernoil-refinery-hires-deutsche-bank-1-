OMV AG (OMV) , central  Europe ’s biggest oil
company, may sell its stake in the Bayernoil Raffinerie GmbH
joint venture as part of a plan to dispose of 1 billion euros
($1.3 billion) of refining and marketing assets by 2014.  “The possible sale of the 45 percent stake in the
Bayernoil refinery network will be evaluated,” the Vienna-based
company said today in a statement. “This would involve a
reduction in the annual refining capacity by 4.6 million tons to
17.7 million tons.”  European refineries are being shut down or sold off as slow
growth erodes fuel demand. OMV in September announced plans to
sell refining units and filling stations to focus on exploration
and production, which offers higher margins and is expected to
account for 55 percent of the company’s total assets by 2021.  The other shareholders of Bayernoil are Ruhr Oel GmbH,
which has 25 percent, Agip Ltd.’s German unit with 20 percent
and BP Plc with a 10 percent stake.  The Austrian producer sold its 52 percent stake in Cypriot
retail company Kibris in November and last month put its
Croatian and Bosnian filling stations up for sale.  OMV also said today that it hired Deutsche Bank AG to
handle the structuring and implementation of its divestment
program, including negotiations with would-be buyers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
