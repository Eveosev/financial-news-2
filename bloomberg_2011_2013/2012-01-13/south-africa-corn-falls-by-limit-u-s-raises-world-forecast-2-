South African white and yellow corn
dropped by the maximum limit on the country’s futures exchange
after the U.S government unexpectedly increased its global
supply estimate.  Yellow corn for July delivery, the most actively traded
contract, fell 80 rand, or 3.9 percent, to 1,960 rand by the
midday close in Johannesburg. White corn for March delivery
retreated 10 rand, or 3 percent, to 2,622 rand. White corn is
the nation’s staple food.  Global production will exceed demand for the first time in
three years as higher harvests in the U.S., the largest grower,
 Russia , Ukraine and the European Union more than offset losses
in  Argentina , the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said in a
report yesterday. That prompted the agency to raise its world
inventory estimate.  Trading “was not good at all as the USDA report went
against all expectations,” Hennes Enslin, a trader with
Bushveld Tradebase Holdings, said in an interview from Pretoria.
