Charter rates for iron ore-carrying
capesize ships may extend this year’s 64 percent slump once port
congestion eases, according to Pareto Securities AS, an Oslo-
based investment bank.  Rents for the vessels, which haul at least 160,000 metric
tons of cargo, declined 18 percent to $9,959 a day yesterday,
according to the  Baltic Exchange  in  London . Panamax ships about
half the size cost $10,663 daily to charter. It’s the first time
in five months capesize rates have matched panamaxes.  About 5.8 percent of the dry-bulk fleet is delayed at
ports, Pareto said, citing information from ViaMar, a company
that tracks congestion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
