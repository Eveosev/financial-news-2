Turkey plans to spur local companies
to make  wind turbines  to curb imports that may cost $20 billion
over 20 years, its main scientific research agency said.  Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  supports legal changes
on state purchasing to allow the  Scientific and Technological
Research Council of Turkey , or Tubitak, to set up companies and
spur technology transfers, Chairman Yucel Altunbasak said. The
agency wants to take stakes in startups, and may give Turkish
manufacturers research and technical assistance, he said.  “There are legal problems with Tubitak forming commercial
ventures or companies and we’re working on overcoming them,” he
said today in Ankara. Tubitak is also supporting development of
local auto, aviation, missile and radar technology, he said.  Turkey is seeking to cut a  current-account deficit  of about
10 percent of gross domestic product by reducing its dependence
on imported energy and encouraging local manufacturing output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
