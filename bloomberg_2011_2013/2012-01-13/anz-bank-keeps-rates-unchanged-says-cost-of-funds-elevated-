Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd . left its variable  interest rates  for home loans and
small company loans unchanged, citing weaker demand for
borrowing among customers.  The lender “assessed our competitive position, the subdued
state of credit demand and the overall state of the economy and
decided it was prudent to maintain our current rates at this
time,” ANZ Bank’s Australian division Chief Executive Officer
Philip Chronican said in a statement today.  The announcement is the first time the Melbourne-based bank
instituted its policy announced Dec. 8 of declaring decisions on
 mortgage rates  on the second Friday of every month. The bank is
seeking to decouple itself from the  Reserve Bank  of  Australia ’s
 interest-rate cycle , in which policy makers meet on the first
Tuesday of every month except January.  “These higher interest rates we are now paying our
depositors and the elevated prices we are required to pay for
wholesale funds are going to be sustained given the volatility
we saw late last year,” Chronican said today.  Australian lenders face increased pressure over mortgages
after the government warned banks last month that customers
would be “rightly angry” if any RBA rate cut wasn’t passed on
in full.  Central bank Governor  Glenn Stevens  will reduce the
benchmark overnight  cash rate target  next month to 4 percent
from 4.25 percent, adding to quarter-point reductions in
November and December, according to 15 of 20 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
