Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI) , the world’s
fourth-biggest gold producer, aims to restart drilling at its
exploration project in Kyrgyzstan within three months after it
signed a partnership agreement with local villagers following an
attack on its camp by armed horsemen.  Plans to resume drilling at the Talas copper and gold
project were halted in October after the attack and after
leaders at a nearby village were threatened with death if they
cooperated with the company. Drilling has been disrupted since
April 2010 following political instability in the central Asian
state, David Grant, head of the operation, said in an interview
from Kyrgyzstan today.  “We are now back in a stable situation and we look forward
to being able to drill continuously once we start,” Grant said.
“Our license agreement runs through to 2015 so we still have
time to fulfill the full drilling program.”  Under the new agreement, Gold Fields will give priority to
local residents when hiring new staff and will implement
economic and social programs to develop the region in return for
carrying out its exploration work.  To contact the reporters on this story:
