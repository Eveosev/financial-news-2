Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM) , a South
African retailer controlled by Wal-Mart Stores Inc., fell for
the first time in nine trading days after Deutsche Bank AG cut
its recommendation on the stock to “sell” from “hold.”  Massmart  declined  2.2 percent to 178.76 rand at the close
in Johannesburg, the biggest drop in three months. Deutsche
Bank’s 12-month price estimate is 140 rand.  While Massmart may benefit from “potential synergies from
a Wal-Mart tie-up,” Deutsche Bank has concerns about near-term
earnings from “potentially aggressive discounting to pursue
market share” and “the potential drag on earnings from a
significant investment in supply chain and organic growth,”
Nick Higham, a Johannesburg-based analyst, wrote in a note dated
yesterday.  Deutsche Bank’s downgrade means only two of 14 analysts
monitored by Bloomberg don’t have a “sell”  recommendation  on
Massmart. None recommend buying the shares.  Bentonville, Arkansas-based  Wal-Mart (WMT) , the world’s biggest
retailer, bought Massmart in June for 16.5 billion rand ($2.05
billion). Sales in the 26 weeks ended December increased 15
percent to 31.6 billion rand, Massmart said Jan. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
