Statoil ASA (STL)  is trying to sell its
stake in the West Qurna-2 oilfield in  Iraq , the Middle East
Economic Survey reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The company may use the negotiations to improve the terms
of the West Qurna-2 contract and decide against pulling out,
according to MEES. A Statoil spokesman refused to confirm or
deny the assertion, MEES said.  Foreign companies operating in Iraq have encountered
difficult working conditions, excessive bureaucracy and
unattractive rates of return, it said. It would be the first re-
sale of energy assets awarded to international companies during
Iraqâ€™s 2009 auction round, the publication reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
