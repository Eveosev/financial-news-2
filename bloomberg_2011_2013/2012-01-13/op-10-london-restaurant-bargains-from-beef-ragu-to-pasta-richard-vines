‘Cheap eats’ is a relative term in
 London , where a meal in a smart restaurant may cost 100 pounds
($153) a head and inexpensive food is often found in chains.  Here are 10 quality venues where you might enjoy a dish --
or even a meal -- and a glass of wine for less than 25 pounds.  Cay Tre Soho: This Soho outlet of the original Vietnamese
restaurant in Hoxton opened last year. Nothing on the lunch menu
costs more than 10 pounds. Try the Pho anytime and for dinner,
don’t miss La Vong Grilled Fish at 7 pounds a head.
 http://www.caytresoho.co.uk/  or +44-20-7317-9118.  Chabrot Bistrot d’Amis: This authentic French bistro, near
Zuma, was created by experienced restaurateurs. It’s low-key,
yet the food and wine are something to shout about. Don’t miss
the warm starter of duck pate with a Comte cheese pastry like a
Yorkshire pudding. It costs 8.50 pounds and you may struggle to
leave the place for less than 25 pounds.
 http://www.chabrot.co.uk/  or +44-20-7225-2238.  Delhi Grill: I am a regular at this Indian cafe, or
“dhaba,” on Chapel Market, in Islington. It’s one of my
favorite places to eat in any  price range . The Rogan Gosht is a
particularly fine dish, the fresh, individual spices discernable
in the slow-cooked lamb and its rich gravy. It’s 8.95 pounds.
Roti are 1 pound each and Tarka Dhal is 4.50 pounds.
 http://www.delhigrill.com/  or +44-20-7278-8100.  Ducksoup: This offshoot of Mark Hix’s restaurant group
serves inventive dishes at a counter in Soho. Lunch is 12 pounds
including a glass of wine, and the standard of cooking is high.
It’s enjoyable and you may eat very well for less than you would
pay in a bog-standard chain. Chef is Hix veteran Julian Biggs.
 http://www.ducksoupsoho.co.uk/  or +44-20-7287-4599.  Hereford Road: This West London restaurant serves
uncomplicated British food and aims for maximum flavor with
minimum fuss. It’s the trademark of chefs such as Hix and  Fergus
Henderson . The weekday set lunch -- with dishes such as grilled
sardines and fennel salad -- is 13 pounds for two courses and
15.50 pounds for three.  http://www.herefordroad.org/  or +44-20-
7727-1144.  Jose: This is a tiny, corner tapas venue in Bermondsey
where you might drop in for a plate of ham and a glass of
sherry. Chef Jose Pizarro has now also opened the bigger Pizarro
nearby.  http://www.josepizarro.com/  or +44-20-7403-4902.  Magdalen: This understated French restaurant near London
Bridge punches above its weight in terms of food and wine: It’s
unfussy and inexpensive. While it barely squeezes into the sub-
25 pounds category for dinner, the weekday set lunch is 15.50
pounds for two courses and 18.50 pounds for three.
 http://www.magdalenrestaurant.co.uk/  or +44-20-7403-1342.  Restaurant at the  Royal Academy : Oliver Peyton is known as
a judge on “ The Great British Menu .” He’s also the man behind
restaurants at London galleries such as the National. This venue
on Piccadilly may be my favorite, for the Lentil, peas & toasted
cashew burger (14.50 pounds) and the beautiful room.
 http://bit.ly/f7uLS7  or +44-20-7300-5608  Trullo: This Italian restaurant in north London can be a
difficult place to get a table and there’s no point showing up
without a booking. It started serving lunch only recently, so
things may be getting easier. It’s worth the effort to try the
fresh-rolled pasta and the meat and fish from the charcoal
grill. Pappardelle with beef shin ragu (8 pounds) is a favorite.
 http://www.trullorestaurant.com/  or +44-20-7226-2733.  Zucca: More than once, I have sat at the counter -- my
favorite seat -- at the popular Zucca and watched group after
group of would-be diners turned away. If I went to south London
only once in a year, it would be to this fine Italian
restaurant, where the chef Sam Harris’s pasta dishes alone are
worth the journey. There is also an outstanding wine list.
 http://www.zuccalondon.com/  or +44-20-7378-6809.  Honorable mention: Rosemary Lane: You might spot this
restaurant near Tower Gateway on the  Docklands Light Railway  and
it’s worth a special journey. Chef Cristina Anghelescu describes
her style as French-Californian. The dishes in this former pub
are light and fresh.  http://www.rosemarylane.btinternet.co.uk/
