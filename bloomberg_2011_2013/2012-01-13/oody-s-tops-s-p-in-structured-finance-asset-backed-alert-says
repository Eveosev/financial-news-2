Moody’s Investors Service won more
structured-finance business than  Standard & Poor’s  last year for
the first time since 1997, Asset-Backed Alert said.  Moody’s graded about 70 percent of securities backed by
everything from mortgages to auto loans in 2011, the newsletter
said today, citing data it compiled. S&P issued ratings on 62
percent of securitizations.  Banks generally hire more than one credit-rating company to
evaluate each deal. Both S&P and Moody’s are based in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
