Statoil ASA (STL)  estimates the  King Lear 
and Crux wells to be drilled later this year in the  North Sea 
may each hold more than 250 million barrels of oil equivalent
gross, Upstream reported, citing Gro Gunleiksrud Haatvedt,
Statoilâ€™s head of exploration off  Norway .  Statoil will be willing to take more risk drilling in
growth prospects in order to develop clusters, Haatvedt told the
Oslo-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
