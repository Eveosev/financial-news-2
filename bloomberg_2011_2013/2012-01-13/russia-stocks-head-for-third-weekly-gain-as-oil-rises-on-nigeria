Russian stocks  pared its third
weekly advance as crude dropped to a three-week low after
European Union officials said an embargo on Iranian crude
imports may be delayed for six months.  The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  fell 0.1 percent to 1,463.43 by
6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, paring its weekly gain to 1.6
percent. Oil producer OAO Gazprom Neft fell 2.1 percent while
 VTB Group (VTBR) , the nation’s biggest lender, rallied 2.2 percent. The
dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  dropped 0.8 percent to 1,446.46.  Oil,  Russia ’s chief export earner, slid 0.6 percent to
$98.52 after the officials said that the ban would be postponed
to allow countries such as Greece, Italy and  Spain  find
alternative supplies. International Atomic Energy Agency
inspectors will go to Tehran this month to discuss  Iran’s
nuclear program , two diplomats with knowledge of the talks said.
Brent oil for February settlement declined 90 cents to $110.36 a
barrel.  “There has been a $10 to $15 per barrel premium in the
Brent price because of  Iran  recently,”  Chris Weafer , chief
strategist at Troika Dialog, wrote in emailed comments. “As
that threat eases, the premium is shrinking.”  The Micex, which has rallied 4.4 percent this year, trades
at 5.5 times analysts’ earnings estimates for member companies,
the lowest among the so-called BRIC nations, which include
 Brazil , India and  China . The index dropped 17 percent in 2011,
compared with an 18 percent slide for Brazil’s Bovespa index,
which trades at 9.4 times estimated earnings according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The Shanghai Composite Index trades at
9.3 times estimated earnings, and the BSE India Sensitive Index
has a ratio of 14.  Russia-focused equity funds attracted $43 million of
inflows in the week to Jan. 11, UralSib Financial Corp, said in
a report, citing EPFR Global Data. “This is the first week of
positive flows week in the last eight,” analyst Slava Smolyaninov said in a report e-mailed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
