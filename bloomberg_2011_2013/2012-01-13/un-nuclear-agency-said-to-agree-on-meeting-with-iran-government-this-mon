The  International Atomic Energy
Agency  has agreed to a meeting at the end of this month between
IAEA inspectors and representatives of the Iranian government,
two diplomats with knowledge of the talks said.  The agenda for the meeting in Tehran is still being
discussed, the diplomats said today on condition of anonymity
because the discussions are still in progress. One sticking
point is whether the IAEA will allow Iran to study some of the
intelligence that alleges military work, according to one of the
diplomats.  Citing unidentified sources it said were “credible,” the
IAEA reported in November that Iranian work toward a nuclear
weapon continued until 2010. Iran, the second largest producer
in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, has
maintained that its nuclear program is to generate power.  Iranian Vice President Fereydoun Abbasi traveled to Vienna
in June to personally invite IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano
to visit the Persian Gulf nation.  Iran  withdrew the offer in
November after the IAEA released its report citing documents
that showed work by the Islamic Republic “on the development of
an indigenous design of a nuclear weapon including the testing
of components.”  Iran has alleged that documents in the IAEA’s possession
are forged. The country has in the past refused to address the
nuclear-weapons allegations until it is allowed to examine the
evidence being used against it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
