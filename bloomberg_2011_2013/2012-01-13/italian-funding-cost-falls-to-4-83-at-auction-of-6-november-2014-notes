Italy  sold 4.75 billion euros ($6.1
billion) of bonds, its maximum target, as borrowing costs fell
at the second auction this week amid a rally in the government’s
short-dated debt.  The Treasury sold 3 billion euros of benchmark securities
due in November 2014 to yield 4.83 percent, down from 5.62
percent at the previous sale on Dec. 29. The Rome-based Treasury
also priced 779 million euros of its 4.25 percent 2014 bond to
yield 4.29 percent and sold 971 million euros of a 4.5 percent
bond due in 2018 at a yield of 5.75 percent.  Italy yesterday auctioned 12 billion euros in treasury
bills as borrowing costs plunged in the country’s first debt
sale of the year. The result may help ease investor concern
about Italy’s ability to finance  Europe ’s second-biggest debt,
which pushed the yield on the country’s benchmark 10-year bond
above the 7 percent level that led  Greece , Ireland and  Portugal 
to seek bailouts.  “While the limited supply helped, the Treasury has met its
target, which was not the case in its previous auction of 3-year
notes on December 29,” Nicholas Spiro, managing director of
Spiro Sovereign Strategy in  London , said in a note to investors.
“The greater the success with medium-to-long maturities, the
more credible” will be “the argument that underlying sentiment
toward Italy is improving.”  Prices of Italy’s notes and bills have surged amid
speculation banks have bought them after receiving three-year
loans from the  European Central Bank  under a program announced
last month. Italy, which faces more than 100 billion euros in
debt maturities in the first quarter, yesterday sold 8.5 billion
euros of one-year bills at 2.735 percent, the lowest since June
and less than half the rate paid at the last sale on Dec. 12.  ‘Significant’ Challenges  “The issuance challenge for Italy remains significant,”
London-based Citigroup Inc. strategists including Jamie Searle
said in a note to clients. “Market pressures are more acute in
the 10-year sector, which will face supply in two weeks time.”  The yield on Italy’s 10-year bond was at 6.54 percent after
the auction at 11:56 a.m. Rome time, down 8 basis points from
yesterday. The  yield gap  with equivalent-maturity German bonds
was 475 basis points, down from a two-month high of 531 basis
points on Jan. 9. The Treasury, which must sell about 450
billion euros of debt this year, is next scheduled to auction
bonds on Jan. 30.  ECB President  Mario Draghi  said yesterday that his strategy
for battling Europe’s debt crisis by easing credit to banks is
starting to work. Draghi said he expects “substantial demand”
for the ECB’s second batch of three-year loans on Feb. 29.  “The provision of liquidity and the allotment modes for
refinancing operations will continue to support the euro-area
banks, and thus the financing of the real economy,” Draghi told
a news conference in  Frankfurt  after the central bank held its
benchmark rate at a record low of 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
