The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt rose, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments increased eight basis points to 362.5 basis points
at 5 p.m. in London. An increase signals deterioration in
perceptions of  credit quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings was 11 basis
points higher at 727, after rising as much as 21 basis points,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 0.75 basis point to 171.75 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers was up 4.5 basis points at 270.5, after
rising as much as 13 basis points, and the subordinated index
climbed five to 485.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($12.7 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
