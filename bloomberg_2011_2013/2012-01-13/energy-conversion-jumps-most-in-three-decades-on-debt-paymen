Energy Conversion Devices Inc. (ENER) , a
U.S. solar panel maker that suspended production last year,
climbed the most in almost three decades after making an
interest payment that it had previously deferred.  Energy Conversion rose 63 percent to 93 cents at the close
in New York, the biggest gain since July 1983. The stock has
more than tripled this week, giving it a market value of $49.5
million.  Energy Conversionâ€™s payment on its 3 percent convertible
notes due 2013 satisfied its current obligation on the debt, the
 Auburn Hills , Michigan-based company said today in a statement.  The company suspended production in November to reduce
inventory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
