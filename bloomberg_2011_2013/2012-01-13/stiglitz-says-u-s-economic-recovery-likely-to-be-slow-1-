Nobel Prize-winning economist  Joseph Stiglitz  said the U.S. economic recovery is “likely to be very
slow.”  “Looking at it from the point of view of the U.S. workers,
no one really anticipates us being back to normal before 2017,
and that’s optimistic,” Stiglitz told reporters in the eastern
Indian city of Kolkata today. “But we may be able to start
growing before that, so there are two different dimensions.”  Stiglitz, a professor of economics at  Columbia University ,
said the “fundamental problems” in the U.S. and Europe were
“deep.”  “There will be some ups and downs, but we are not going to
really have a strong recovery for several years,” Stiglitz
said, adding that should have made the  European Central Bank 
“more cautious about raising interest rates” last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
