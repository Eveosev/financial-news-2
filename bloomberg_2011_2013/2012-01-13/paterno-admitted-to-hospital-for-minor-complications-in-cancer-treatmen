Former Penn State University
football coach Joe Paterno was admitted to a hospital for
observation due to minor cancer treatment complications.  Paterno, 85, who disclosed in November through his family
that he had a treatable form of  lung cancer , entered a hospital
today to undergo a “regimen of treatments,” according to an e-
mailed statement by spokesman Dan McGinn.  “Although these issues have been challenging for coach
Paterno and his family, he has total confidence in his doctors
and is determined to make a full recovery,” the statement said.  Paterno was fired Nov. 9 for his handling of child
molestation charges against former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky, ending Paterno’s 46-year run with the Nittany Lions
that produced a record 409 wins.  After he was diagnosed with cancer during a follow-up visit
to his doctor for a bronchial illness, his son Scott said that
Paterno and his doctors were optimistic he will make a full
recovery.  Paterno also broke his pelvis in a fall at his home last
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
