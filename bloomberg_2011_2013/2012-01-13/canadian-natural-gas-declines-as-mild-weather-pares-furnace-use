Canadian natural gas declined amid
mild U.S. weather that has cut the need for furnace fuels.  Alberta  gas fell 0.1 percent. Highs in  Chicago  will touch
41 degrees Fahrenheit (5 Celsius) Jan. 16, 11 degrees higher
than normal, according to  State College , Pennsylvania-based
AccuWeather Inc. The U.S. Midwest is the biggest market for
 Canada ’s gas exports.  “There’s no sustained cold in the weather outlook,” said
Brad Florer, a trader with Kottke Associates in Chicago. “The
pressure remains on gas prices.”  Alberta gas for February delivery fell 0.25 cent to C$2.465
a gigajoule ($2.28 per million British thermal units) at 12:01
p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in Canada
and the U.S. and priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for February delivery on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  fell 3.2 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $2.665
per million Btu as of 12:09 p.m.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 17.5 billion cubic
feet, 707 million above target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 3.15 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta. The fuel is transferred to TransCanada’s
main line at Empress.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.15 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 890 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.76 billion cubic feet today, or 66 percent of its
capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.84
billion cubic feet at 10:50 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
