The U.S. Treasury Department
released its quarterly survey of bond dealers today and asked
them to discuss trends in market liquidity as well as their
assessment for market securities.  The questionnaire is designed to lead up to Jan. 26-27
meeting of the Treasury’s Wall Street advisory panel. The form
asks about the Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, or TIPS.  “Please comment on current demand for TIPs securities and
how Treasury might further develop the TIPS program,” the
Treasury said in the questionnaire. “In this discussion, please
include your thoughts on tenors and sizes for TIPS issuance in
2012.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
