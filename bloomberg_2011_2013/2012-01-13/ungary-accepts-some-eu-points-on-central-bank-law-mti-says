Hungary  accepts some of the European
Union’s criticism of its central bank law, while the two sides
remain far apart on other aspects of the legislation,  MTI 
reported, citing Prime Minister  Viktor Orban .  The European Union doesn’t have the right to influence
Hungary’s handling of its judiciary and a dispute over the
country’s data protection ombudsman “seems a speck of dust in
the machine,” state-run news service MTI reported, citing
comments by Orban in a radio interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
