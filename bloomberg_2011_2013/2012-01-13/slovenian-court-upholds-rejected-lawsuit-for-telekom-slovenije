A Slovenian appeals court upheld a
lower-court decision to dismiss a complaint by Sinfonika d.d.
against national phone company  Telekom Slovenije (TLSG)  d.d. over its
alleged dominant position.  Sinfonika, which is in bankruptcy, was seeking 34 million
euros ($44 million) in damages from Telekom Slovenije for the
alleged abuse of its dominant market share, the Ljubljana-based
telecommunications company said in a  statement  to the city stock
exchange today. The decision is final, Telekom said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
