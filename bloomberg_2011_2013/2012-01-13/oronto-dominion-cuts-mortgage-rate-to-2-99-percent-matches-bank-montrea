Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , Canada’s
second-largest bank, reduced its four-year fixed-rate mortgage
to 2.99 percent, following a rate cut yesterday by smaller rival
 Bank of Montreal. (BMO)   The lower rate is effective tomorrow and is available only
on new mortgage applications made until Feb. 29, the lender said
today in a statement. The previous rate for a four-year fixed
mortgage at Toronto-Dominion was 4.79 percent.  Bank of Montreal, the country’s fourth-largest bank,
yesterday cut the rate on its five-year mortgage by 50 basis
points to 2.99 percent, a record low for the Toronto-based
lender. Toronto-Dominion also cut its six- and seven-year
mortgage rates yesterday.  “We definitely acknowledge that there is a competitive
rate environment,” Farhaneh Haque, the bank’s director of
mortgage advice, said today in a telephone interview. “If we
look at the bigger picture here, we’re gearing up for a spring
market that typically starts in February.”  Canadian  household debt  rose to a record 153 percent of
disposable income in the third quarter of 2011 as borrowing
costs increased, according to a Dec. 13 report by Statistics
Canada.  To contact the reporter on this story:
