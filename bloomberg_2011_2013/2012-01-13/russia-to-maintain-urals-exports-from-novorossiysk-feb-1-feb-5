Russia , the worldâ€™s largest oil
producer, will ship five cargoes of Urals crude from
Novorossiysk on the  Black Sea  from Feb. 1 to Feb. 5, unchanged
from a month earlier, according to a partial loading schedule
obtained by Bloomberg News.  Two cargoes of 140,000 metric tons each and three 80,000-
ton shipments will be loaded from the port, the plan showed. The
schedule for all of January will be released later this month.  Loading programs are schedules of crude shipments compiled
by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan their
supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
