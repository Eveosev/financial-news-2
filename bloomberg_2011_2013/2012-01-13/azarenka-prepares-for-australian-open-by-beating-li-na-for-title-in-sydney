Victoria Azarenka  tuned up for the
Australian Open by winning the Sydney International for her
ninth tennis title.  Third-seeded Azarenka beat No. 4 Li Na of China 6-2, 1-6,
6-3 at Sydney Olympic Park Tennis Centre to win her first title
since October’s Luxembourg Open. The Australian Open starts in
three days.  In each of the past three years, at least one finalist from
the top-tier women’s event in Sydney went on to reach the
Australian Open finals. Li beat  Kim Clijsters  in the 2011 Sydney
final before the Belgian won their rematch at  Melbourne  Park for
her fourth Grand Slam title.  Azarenka was today drawn to play Heather Watson of Britain
in the first round in Melbourne, while Li will face 40th-ranked
Ksenia Pervak of Kazakhstan. Defending champion Clijsters starts
against a qualifier.  Twelve months ago in Sydney, Li became the first Chinese
player to win a so-called Premier-level title and went on to
secure the nation’s first Grand Slam singles championship at the
 French Open  in June.  To contact the reporters on this story:
