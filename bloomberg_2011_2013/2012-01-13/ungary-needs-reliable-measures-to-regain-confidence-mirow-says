Thomas Mirow , president of the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, comments on
Hungary’s efforts to secure funding from international creditors
and European Union criticism of the country’s budget and
policies.  Mirow spoke in a question-and-answer session following a
presentation at a conference in Vallendar,  Germany , today.  On the need to regain investor confidence:  “What Hungary needs to do is, on the one hand, look at
debt-reduction measures, which are not one-off measures but are
of a structural nature. And, two, is to provide domestic
investors, as well as foreign investors, with the feeling that
they can really rely on long-term decisions, and that they are
not confronted time and again with emergency measures, short-
term measures in terms of levies and taxes -- the kinds of
decisions that have a direct impact on their business plans.
With  Hungary  it is a question of reliability and trust needing
to be re-established.”  On the European Union’s reprimand:  “The European Union probably should have looked more
closely at Hungary earlier than they did. It also seems that the
current Hungarian government finally understands that they will
need some support from the outside, so this may be the only
argument for them to change their position to some degree. It’s
obvious that they have taken a whole series of decisions which
have not been seen as improving the country’s investment
environment. I have spoken with the prime minister and have
written letters to him on this.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
