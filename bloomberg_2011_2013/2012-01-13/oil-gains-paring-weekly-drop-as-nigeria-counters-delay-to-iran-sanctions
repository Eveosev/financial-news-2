Oil for February delivery rose as
much as 54 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $99.64 a barrel in
electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  and was
at $99.63 at 1:52 p.m. Sydney time.  Nigerian labor unions said yesterday they will continue a
strike that threatens oil exports from  Africa ’s top producer
because no agreement has been reached yet with President
Goodluck Jonathan on restoring fuel subsidies. The oil union
Pengassan said it would begin shutting down oil output on Jan.
15 if there was no agreement with the government.  Crude dropped 1.8 percent yesterday to $99.10, the lowest
close since Dec. 30, after a proposed European Union embargo of
Iranian crude imports against the nation’s nuclear program was
said to be facing a delay of six months.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
