General Motors Co. (GM)  offered to shift
production of Chevrolet models from Korea to factories of its
European Opel unit as part of negotiations on cutting costs,
 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported, citing unidentified
officials at  Germany â€™s IG Metall union.  In exchange for production of as much as 300,000 Chevrolet
Cruze and Aveo models, IG Metall workers would be asked to give
up part of a planned wage increase this year, the newspaper
reported. As part of the negotiations, the company is also
considering where to produce the Mokka compact sport-utility
vehicle, FAZ said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
