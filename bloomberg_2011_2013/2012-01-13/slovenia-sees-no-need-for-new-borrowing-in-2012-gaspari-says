Slovenia’s rising borrowing costs
won’t affect the euro-region country because it has “to a
certain extent” covered its refinancing needs, Mitja Gaspari,
the outgoing European Union and Development Minister said.  Yields above 7 percent “mean that future borrowing costs
would cause great trouble in servicing debt because the price
would simply be too high,” Gaspari said in an  interview  with
public broadcaster TV Slovenija late yesterday. “Slovenia has
covered to a certain extent its 2012 refinancing needs to repay
principal and interest, so there is no urgent need to tap
international markets.”  Slovenia may get administrators from the European Union
this year, if the political impasse “that the country became
known for” continues, Gaspari said in the interview.  The yield on Slovenia’s government notes maturing in
January 2021 was at 7.146 percent at 7:40 a.m. in Ljubljana,
according to mid-pricing data compiled by Bloomberg. Lawmakers
on Jan. 11 rejected the poll winner Zoran Jankovic as new
premier, deepening the political crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
