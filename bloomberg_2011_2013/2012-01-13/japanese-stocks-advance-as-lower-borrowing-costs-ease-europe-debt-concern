     Jan. 13 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  shares  rose, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average finishing a weekly advance, after lower
Italian and Spanish borrowing costs signaled that European
policy makers are getting a handle on the debt crisis.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that gets a third of its revenue
in Europe, rose 3.1 percent after the yen fell against the euro
yesterday. Pacific Metals Co. led iron and steel companies
higher after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. picked it as one of this
year’s top Japanese stocks.  Inpex Corp. (1605)  climbed 1.2 percent
after Japan’s biggest energy explorer said it would proceed with
a $34 billion liquefied natural gas project in  Australia .  The  Nikkei 225  rose 1.4 percent to 8,500.02 at the 3 p.m.
trading close in Tokyo, climbing 1.3 percent on the week. The
broader Topix Index gained 1 percent to 734.60 with about four
stocks advancing for each that fell today.  Once concern about  Europe ’s debt crisis is “lifted at
least in the short-term, we should see some good performance in
Asian equity markets,” said Diane Lin, a manager with Sydney-
based fund Pengana Capital Ltd., which oversees about $1.1
billion in global assets. European Central Bank policy makers
“have stabilized the whole situation.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 0.2 percent
today. The gauge added 0.2 percent in  New York  yesterday as ECB
President  Mario Draghi  said there were signs of economic
stabilization after the central bank provided three-year loans
to lenders totaling a record 489 billion euros ($628 billion)
last month to maintain liquidity.  Debt Auctions  At debt sales yesterday, Spain’s two-year yield fell to the
lowest since March after the nation raised 9.98 billion euros,
twice as much as its target. Italy’s two-year yields were the
lowest since September.  Exporters rose after the yen fell 0.7 percent against the
euro yesterday. Canon advanced 3.1 percent to 3,355 yen.  Nippon
Sheet Glass Co. (5202) , which has the highest percentage of revenue
from Europe on the Nikkei 225, rose 1.5 percent to 138 yen.  “The ECB’s liquidity injection is keeping the debt crisis
from spreading,” said Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at
Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings Inc. “The yen’s rise against the
euro had weighed on Japanese stocks. Now that’s taking a pause,
the bias is for equities to be bought back.”  Goldman’s Picks  Pacific Metals added 4.5 percent to 375 yen, while
 Bridgestone Corp. (5108)  gained 1.4 percent to 1,733 yen. Iron and
steel companies had the second-largest advance in the Topix’s 33
industry groups.  Goldman Sachs said Pacific Metals and Bridgestone are among
the Japanese stocks that will advance the most this year as the
market recovers from its worst slide since 2008.  Pacific Metals may soar as much as 60 percent, while
Bridgestone may climb 55 percent, the investment bank said in a
note to clients yesterday.  Inpex gained 1.2 percent to 516,000 yen after saying it and
Total SA of  France  will go forward with their $34 billion
Ichthys LNG venture,  Japan ’s single-biggest investment in
Australia, to meet rising demand from utilities.  Japan’s stocks tumbled last year on the yen’s rise, the
March temblor and tsunami, and nuclear meltdowns at Tokyo
Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant. The Topix
slumped 19 percent in 2011, exceeding an 11 percent drop in the
Stoxx Europe 600 index that tracks companies at the epicenter of
the region’s debt crisis.  Shares on the Topix are  valued  at 0.89 times book value
near the lowest since March 2009. A number below one means
investors can buy companies for less than the value of their
assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
