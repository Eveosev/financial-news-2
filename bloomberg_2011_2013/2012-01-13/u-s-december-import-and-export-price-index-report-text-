The following is the text of the U.S.
import and export price index report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  U.S. import prices edged down 0.1 percent in December, the  U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics  reported today, after rising 0.8 percent the previous month. In
December, declining prices for fuels more than offset a 0.1 percent rise in
nonfuel prices. Export prices also decreased in December, falling 0.5 percent
following a 0.1 percent advance in November.  Imports
All Imports:  Import prices resumed a downward trend, declining 0.1 percent following a
0.8 percent upturn in November. The price index for overall imports rose 8.5
percent in 2011, driven by a 9.2 percent increase for the index over the first
five months of the year. 2011 was the third consecutive year that import prices
rose, advancing 5.3 percent and 8.6 percent, respectively in 2010 and 2009,
after declining 10.1 percent in 2008.  Fuel Imports:  Fuel prices fell 0.5 percent in December after rising 3.7 percent in
November. In December, lower prices for both petroleum and natural gas, down 0.4
percent and 4.9 percent, respectively, each contributed to the overall decline.
Despite falling 3.4 percent since April, overall fuel prices advanced 25.2
percent in 2011 as a 27.4 percent rise in petroleum prices more than offset a
9.4 percent drop in natural  gas prices . Fuel prices previously advanced 14.2
percent in 2010 and 62.2 percent in 2009.  All Imports Excluding Fuel:  The price index for nonfuel imports ticked up 0.1 percent in December
following 0.2 percent decreases in each of the two previous months. In December,
higher prices for each of the major finished goods categories led nonfuel import
prices up despite lower prices for nonfuel industrial supplies and materials and
foods, feeds, and beverages. Nonfuel import prices advanced 3.4 percent over the
past year after rising 3.0 percent in 2010. Higher prices for nonfuel industrial
supplies and materials; foods, feeds, and beverages; and finished goods all
contributed to the 2011 increase in nonfuel prices.  Exports  All Exports:  Prices for overall exports declined 0.5 percent in December, following a
0.1 percent advance in November and a 2.0 percent decrease in October. In
December, falling prices for both agricultural exports and nonagricultural
exports factored into the decrease in export prices. The price index for overall
exports rose 3.6 percent in 2011 after rising 6.5 percent in 2010 and 3.4
percent in 2009.  Agricultural Exports:  The price index for agricultural exports fell 2.6 percent in December,
driven by lower prices for corn, soybeans, and wheat, down 8.2 percent, 4.0
percent, and 7.8 percent, respectively. Agricultural prices advanced 0.8 percent
in 2011 despite falling 7.4 percent in the final quarter of the year.
Agricultural prices rose 20.5 percent in 2010 and 9.2 percent in 2009 in
contrast to the relatively small increase in 2011. The rise in agricultural
prices in 2011 was driven by a 28.1 percent increase in vegetable prices and a
7.9 percent advance in corn prices.  All Exports Excluding Agriculture:  Nonagricultural prices fell 0.2 percent in December, led by lower prices
for nonagricultural supplies and materials. Prices for nonagricultural exports
rose 4.0 percent in 2011 after a 5.1 percent increase the previous year and a
2.9 percent advance in 2009.  SELECTED DECEMBER HIGHLIGHTS  Import Prices  Nonfuel Industrial Supplies and Materials:  Nonfuel industrial supplies and materials prices edged down 0.1 percent in
