McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) , the world’s
biggest restaurant chain, will sponsor the Olympic Games through
2020, adding eight years to its tie-in.  The company planned to disclose the extension today at a
media event in Innsbruck, Austria. McDonald’s is already an
Olympics sponsor this year, and says it has been involved in the
games since 1968.  “McDonald’s is renewing our commitment as a worldwide top
sponsor and the official restaurant of the Olympic games for the
next eight years,” Chief Operating Officer Don Thompson said
during a conference call with reporters yesterday. He declined
to disclose the costs of the program.  While there will be no global McDonald’s advertising
campaign for the Olympics, stores will create geographically
specific promotions, Thompson said. The company is based in  Oak
Brook ,  Illinois .  McDonald’s general and administrative  costs  will rise about
7 percent in 2012 because of its sponsorship of  Olympic games ,
added technologies and a global convention, Chief Financial
Officer Peter Bensen said during a shareholder meeting Nov. 10.
The total of the three items this year will be about $100
million, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
