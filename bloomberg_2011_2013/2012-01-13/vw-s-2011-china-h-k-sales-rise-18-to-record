Volkswagen AG (VOW)  (VOW),  Europe ’s largest
carmaker, said its sales in China and  Hong Kong  climbed 18
percent last year to a record, led by deliveries of Lavida and
Sagitar sedans and demand for Audi luxury cars.  The VW group, which also owns the Skoda and Bentley brands,
sold 2.26 million vehicles in the two markets in 2011, the
Wolfsburg, Germany-based carmaker said in an e-mailed statement
today.  General Motors Co. (GM) , the biggest foreign automaker in
China, increased sales in the nation by 8.3 percent last year to
a record 2.55 million vehicles.  Volkswagen is counting on the world’s most populous nation
to drive growth in  emerging markets  as it seeks to surpass GM
and  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  for the global sales crown. China is now
the largest market for its eponymous marque, premium Audi brand
and Lamborghini supercars.  “Although we expect tougher conditions for the car
industry to come, we want to maintain our leading market
position in China,” Karl-Thomas Neumann, chief executive
officer of VW’s China unit said in the statement. “We see a
great potential for an expansion in China’s rural areas where
millions of people will benefit from better mobility.”  China’s auto sales slowed last year, trailing growth in the
U.S. for the first time in at least 14 years, after the
government ended stimulus measures and as the nation’s economic
expansion showed signs of easing.  Vehicle Demand  Growth in passenger-vehicle demand in  China  will accelerate
this year to about 9.5 percent, or about 15.87 million units,
from the 5.2 percent pace last year, according to the auto
association. Car sales in the country rose 33 percent in 2010,
and grew 53 percent in 2009.  The German automaker sold 1.72 million of its main
Volkswagen brand cars in China, an increase of 14 percent from a
year earlier. This amounts to 34 percent of the brand’s global
deliveries of 5.1 million vehicles last year.  Audi, the group’s luxury nameplate that competes with
Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG,
increased sales in China and Hong Kong by 37 percent to a record
313,000 vehicles in 2011, the company said today. China became
Audi’s largest market globally last year, the company added.  Ingolstadt, Germany-based Audi boosted deliveries of
imported cars such as the Q7 sport-utility vehicle and the Audi
A8L sedan. The carmaker also sold more domestically produced A4L
and A6L sedans, whose wheelbases were extended to meet the needs
of chauffeur-driven Chinese buyers.  China Expansion  VW, which has joint ventures with  China FAW Group Corp. (CHFAWZ)  and
 SAIC Motor Corp. (600104)  in China, was the first foreign automaker
allowed to produce cars in the Asian nation. The German
manufacturer said Jan. 6 it will add a seventh car plant in
China as part of plans to invest 14 billion euros ($18 billion)
to expand Chinese production and models by 2016.  The group sold 220,100 units of its entry-level Skoda cars
in China last year, according to the statement. Among its
upscale brands, the company delivered 403 Lamborghini supercars
and 1,780 Bentley cars in the country.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
