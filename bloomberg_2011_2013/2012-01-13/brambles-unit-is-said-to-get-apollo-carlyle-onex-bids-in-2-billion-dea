Brambles Ltd. (BXB) , the world’s largest
supplier of wooden pallets, drew bids from private equity firms
including Carlyle Group LP and  Apollo Global Management LLC (APO)  for
its document-service business in a sale that may raise about $2
billion, said two people with knowledge of the matter.  The firms, which also include Thomas H. Lee Partners LP and
Onex Corp. of  Canada , are studying the Recall unit’s finances
before a deadline for formal bids next month, said the people,
who declined to be identified as the information is private.
They have made preliminary offers, the people said.  Brambles, based in Sydney, said in August it will use the
proceeds from selling Recall to pare debt and invest in CHEP,
its pallet-pooling business. The company, whose clients include
 Procter & Gamble Co . and ConAgra Foods Inc., plans to reduce
annual expenses by $100 million before June 2015.  Spokespeople for Carlyle, Thomas H. Lee and Apollo declined
to comment. Officials at Onex did not return calls to office
lines outside normal office hours. The names of the bidders were
reported earlier today by The Australian Financial Review in its
Street Talk column.  Recall, which competes with  Iron Mountain Inc. (IRM)  in providing
document and data storage, posted a 14 percent increase in
profit to $196.6 million in the latest fiscal year, Brambles
said Aug. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
