What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets. U.S. exchanges will be closed
Jan. 16 for the Martin Luther King holiday.  -- Corn futures are called to open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel
lower on the Chicago Board of Trade after rains this week and
more precipitation forecast next week improve crop prospects in
 South America , reducing demand for U.S. exports, Mike Zuzolo,
the president of Global Commodity Analytics & Consulting LLC in
Lafayette,  Indiana , said in a telephone interview.  -- Soybean futures may open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT on speculation that rain will improve crop yields in
 Argentina ,  Paraguay  and southern  Brazil , while the dollar’s
rally erodes the appeal of U.S. exports, Zuzolo said. Soybean-
oil futures are expected to open 0.2 cent to 0.3 cent a pound
lower, and soybean-meal futures may open 50 cents to $1 lower
per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  after the government yesterday said that U.S.
farmers planted 3.2 percent more of the grain for harvest
beginning in May, Zuzolo said. The greenback’s rally will also
damp demand for U.S. supplies as global inventories are
projected to rise to the highest since 2000, Zuzolo said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
