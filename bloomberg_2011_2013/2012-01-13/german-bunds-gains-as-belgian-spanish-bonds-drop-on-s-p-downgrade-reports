German bonds gained, pushing yields
on five- and 30-year securities to record lows, on speculation
 Standard & Poor’s  will affirm the nation’s AAA rating while
downgrading some of its euro-area peers.  Spanish and Belgian bonds declined as investors shunned the
lower-rated assets for the perceived safety of German debt.
 France , rated AAA, is among several euro-area countries facing
downgrades in the S&P review which is due to be released later
today, a European government official said on condition of
anonymity. Philippa Melaniphy, a spokeswoman at S&P in London,
declined to comment when reached by telephone.  “Bunds are flying in a flight to quality on reports citing
a senior euro-zone source of mass downgrades, excluding the
Netherlands and Germany,” said  Peter Chatwell , a London-based
fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate &
Investment Bank.  Germany ’s 10-year yield fell seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 1.77 percent at 5 p.m. London time, after
dropping to 1.74 percent, the least since Nov. 15. The 2 percent
bund due in January 2022 rose 0.64, or 6.40 euros per 1,000-euro
face amount, to 102.125.  The five-year yield dropped to as low as 0.733 percent, the
least since Bloomberg began collecting the data in 1990. The 30-
year yield slid as much as 10 basis points to 2.33 percent.  S&P placed 15 euro-area nations on review for possible
downgrades on Dec. 5 citing increased “systemic stress” in the
euro region.  Greece ’s creditor banks broke off talks on a debt
swap plan, increasing the risk of the euro-area’s first
sovereign default, the Washington-based  Institute of
International Finance  said in a statement today.  Dutch Bonds  The Dutch 10-year  yield  dropped six basis points to 2.09
percent after reaching a record low 2.073 percent as  Agence
France-Presse  said S&P won’t change its rating of the
Netherlands and Luxembourg.  Italian and Spanish bonds pared declines as the  European
Central Bank  was said to buy the nations’ debt by three people
with knowledge of the transactions who declined to be identified
because the trades are confidential. A spokesman for the ECB in
 Frankfurt  declined to comment.  Spanish 10-year  yields  climbed nine basis points to 5.22
percent after rising as much as 13 basis points. Italy’s 10-year
yields rose were little changed at 6.64 percent after increasing
as high as 6.82 percent.  ‘Some Disappointment’  Italian debt rose in earlier trade before the nation sold
4.75 billion euros of notes due in 2014 and 2018. It erased its
gains after demand weakened at the auction.  “There was a small bid-to-cover, but it was decent, and
the fact that it was only decent provided some disappointment,”
said Alessandro Mercuri, an interest-rate strategist at Lloyds
Bank Corporate Markets in  London .  French 10-year rates climbed four basis points to 3.08
percent. The yield on 10-year Belgian bonds jumped 10 basis
points to 4.16 percent even after the nation’s debt agency said
it hadn’t been contacted by S&P.  Under European Union rules dating from 2009, credit-ratings
companies are obliged to give at least 12 hours notice to
governments before downgrading their sovereign debt.  Belgium sold 400 million euros of bonds maturing in 2028
and 2035 today, less than the 500 million-euro maximum sought,
as borrowing costs declined in its first sale of longer-maturity
debt this year.  Volatility on Austria sovereign debt was the highest in
euro-area markets today, according to measures of 10-year bonds,
two- and 10-year yield spreads and credit-default swaps.  Austria will probably lose its AAA rating at S&P on concern
about bad debts at the country’s banks, according to a person
familiar with the matter. The nation’s 10-year bond yield rose
eight basis points to 3.07 percent.  German  government bonds  are little changed this year, after
gaining 9.7 percent in 2011, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
