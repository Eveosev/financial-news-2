Corn fell for a third day in
 Chicago , heading for the biggest weekly slide since September,
after the U.S. predicted higher crop yields. Soybeans dropped on
an estimate for larger domestic stockpiles.  Yields for the recently harvested corn crop are forecast at
147.2 bushels an acre, up from 146.7 bushels a month ago, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show. Soybean inventories in the
country, the biggest exporter, probably will total 275 million
bushels at the end of the marketing year on Aug. 31, up from 230
million estimated last month, according to the USDA.  “It wasn’t just one big, bearish surprise,” said
 Sudakshina Unnikrishnan , an analyst at  Barclays Capital  in
London. “It was a combination of yields being revised up and
stockpiles being revised.”  Corn for March delivery dropped 0.6 percent to $6.0775 a
bushel by 1:15 p.m.  London  time on the Chicago Board of Trade,
erasing an advance of as much as 0.5 percent. The grain has lost
5.6 percent this week.  Soybeans for March delivery fell 0.2 percent to $11.805 a
bushel, extending a 4 percent decline in the prior two sessions.
The oilseed has retreated 1.3 percent this week.  Wheat for March delivery retreated 0.4 percent to $6.025 a
bushel. The grain has slid 3.6 percent this week, on course for
a second straight drop. Milling wheat for March delivery on NYSE
LIffe in Paris gained 1.3 percent to 196.50 euros ($250.04) a
metric ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
