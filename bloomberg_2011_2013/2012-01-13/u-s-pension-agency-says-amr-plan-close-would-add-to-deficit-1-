Termination of any of  American
Airlines ’ pension plans would have “grave consequences” for
retirees and the federal pension insurance program, the  Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corp.  said.  About $1 billion in benefits would be lost if parent AMR
Corp. terminates the four plans, the PBGC, the federal agency
that insures pensions, said in a filing today in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Manhattan. Termination of any one plan would “add
significantly” to the agency’s $26 billion deficit.  “Termination of any of the debtors pension plans would be
a momentous event with grave consequences for the participants
who are counting on receiving their promised benefits and for
the federal pension insurance program,” the PBGC said.  Fort Worth , Texas-based American, which filed for
bankruptcy in November, said in an e-mailed statement that the
company spends more on its pension plans than competitors spend
on their retirement plans.  “Given American’s plans to reduce its costs to a more
reasonable level in line with industry norms, these costs and
many other factors are considerations when deciding whether to
continue the pension plans,” the company said in the statement.  The PBGC is seeking a court order directing AMR to produce
information related to the plans. AMR has refused to provide
information requested, the PBGC said.  The case is In re  AMR Corp., 11-15463,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
