China ’s increasing demand for
diamonds is expected to support Angolan diamond exports and
prices in 2012, said Antonio Jose Freitas, a spokesman for
state-owned diamond company Endiama EP.  “Amid uncertainty in  Europe  and the U.S., we expect China
to continue to support Angolan diamond sales,” Freitas said in
a phone interview today from the capital, Luanda. Angola is also
“stocking up” on diamonds to support prices, he said.  The southern African country’s diamond production dropped
to 8.32 million carats in 2011 from 8.36 million carats in the
previous year, according to an e-mailed report from Endiama.  The company’s revenue from diamond sales rose to $1.16
billion from $987 million, bolstered by an 18 percent rise in
the average price of the gems to $139.6 per carat from $118.1
per carat, the report showed.  Angola ranks behind Botswana, Russia, Canada and  South
Africa , as the world’s biggest diamond producer by value,
according to De Beers, the world’s largest diamond company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
