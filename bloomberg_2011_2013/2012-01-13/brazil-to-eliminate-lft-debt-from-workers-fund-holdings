Brazil  plans to eliminate floating-
rate bonds from a government-managed workers’ fund this year,
stepping up effort to wean local investors off notes linked to
the  overnight loan rate , Treasury Secretary Arno Augustin said.  The fund, known as FGTS, will swap its Selic-linked bonds
for fixed-rate and inflation-linked bonds, Augustin said in an
interview at his office in Brasilia today. FGTS held more than
30 billion reais ($16.7 billion) of floating-rate bonds, known
as LFTs, as of Dec. 31, 2010, according to the most recent
statement posted on its website.  The move is aimed at improving Brazil’s debt profile by
increasing investments in inflation-linked and fixed-rate bonds,
Augustin said. In November, the government gave public entities
and state companies 90 days to shift about 60 billion reais they
held in floating-rate bonds to other types of government debt.  “It seems this year will be a good one for the debt
profile,” Augustin said. “We are excited. We are working to
reduce LFTs and increase fixed-rate and inflation-linked
bonds.”  The government plans to boost sales of fixed-rate and
inflation-linked bonds and redeem LFTs to reduce its floating-
rate obligations to less than 20 percent of total debt in 2014,
Deputy Secretary  Paulo Valle  said in an Oct 31 interview.
Floating-debt obligations accounted for 31.5 percent of Brazil’s
1.8 trillion reais of debt in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
