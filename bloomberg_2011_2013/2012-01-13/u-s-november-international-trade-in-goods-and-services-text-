The following is the text of the U.S.
trade balance report for Nov. released by the Commerce
Department.  Goods and Services  The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis,
through the  Department of Commerce , announced today that total
November exports of $177.8 billion and imports of $225.6 billion
resulted in a goods and services deficit of $47.8 billion, up
from $43.3 billion in October, revised.  November exports were
$1.5 billion less than October exports of $179.4 billion.
November imports were $2.9 billion more than October imports of
$222.6 billion.  In November, the goods deficit increased $4.6 billion from
October to $63.2 billion, and the services surplus increased $0.1
billion from October to $15.4 billion.  Exports of goods
decreased $1.5 billion to $126.6 billion, and imports of goods
increased $3.1 billion to $189.7 billion.  Exports of services
were virtually unchanged at $51.3 billion, and imports of
services decreased $0.2 billion to $35.9 billion.  The goods and services deficit increased $8.9 billion from
November 2010 to November 2011.  Exports were up $16.6 billion,
or 10.3 percent, and imports were up $25.5 billion, or 12.7
percent.  Goods (Census Basis)  The October to November decrease in exports of goods reflected
decreases in industrial supplies and materials ($1.6 billion);
capital goods ($0.2 billion); other goods ($0.2 billion);
automotive vehicles, parts, and engines ($0.2 billion); and
foods, feeds, and beverages ($0.1 billion). An increase occurred
in  consumer goods  ($0.8 billion).  The October to November increase in imports of goods reflected
increases in industrial supplies and materials ($2.7 billion);
automotive vehicles, parts, and engines ($0.8 billion); other
goods ($0.6 billion); and capital goods ($0.1 billion). Decreases
occurred in consumer goods ($0.7 billion) and foods, feeds, and
beverages ($0.1 billion).  The November 2010 to November 2011 increase in exports of goods
reflected increases in industrial supplies and materials ($6.3
billion); capital goods ($3.5 billion); automotive vehicles,
parts, and engines ($1.6 billion); consumer goods ($0.7 billion);
and other goods ($0.3 billion). A decrease occurred in foods,
feeds, and beverages ($0.1 billion).  The November 2010 to November 2011 increase in imports of goods
reflected increases in industrial supplies and materials ($13.1
billion); capital goods ($3.5 billion); automotive vehicles,
parts, and engines ($2.9 billion); consumer goods ($1.7 billion);
foods, feeds, and beverages ($1.4 billion); and other goods ($0.6
billion).  Services  Exports of services were virtually unchanged from October to
November.  Decreases in travel and passenger fares were mostly
offset by increases in royalties and license fees and other
private services (which includes items such as business,
professional, and technical services, insurance services, and
financial services).  Changes in the other categories of services
exports were small.  Imports of services decreased $0.2 billion from October to
November.  The decrease was more than accounted for by decreases
in travel and other transportation (which includes freight and
port services).  Changes in the other categories of services
imports were small.  The November 2010 to November 2011 increase in exports of
services was $3.8 billion. The largest increases were in
royalties and license fees ($1.5 billion), other private services
($0.9 billion), and travel ($0.7 billion).  Within other private
services, the largest increase was in business, professional, and
technical services.  The November 2010 to November 2011 increase in imports of
services was $2.1 billion. The largest increases were in other
private services ($1.1 billion), other transportation ($0.3
billion), and royalties and license fees ($0.3 billion).  Within
other private services, the largest increase was in business,
professional, and technical services.  Goods and Services Moving Average  For the three months ending in November, exports of goods and
services averaged $179.3 billion, while imports of goods and
services averaged $224.3 billion, resulting in an average trade
deficit of $45.1 billion.  For the three months ending in
October, the average trade deficit was $44.3 billion, reflecting
average exports of $179.3 billion and average imports of $223.6
billion.  Selected Not Seasonally Adjusted Goods Details  The November figures show surpluses, in billions of dollars, with
Hong Kong $3.2 ($3.0 for October), Australia $1.5 ($2.1),
Singapore $1.0 ($1.0), and Egypt $0.1 ($0.2). Deficits were
recorded, in billions of dollars, with China $26.9 ($28.1),
European Union $9.7 ($8.0), OPEC $9.1 ($8.3), Japan $6.2 ($6.2),
Mexico $5.5 ($5.3), Germany $4.7 ($4.3), Canada $3.0 ($2.2),
Ireland $2.8 ($2.8), Nigeria $2.3 ($1.9), Venezuela $1.9 ($2.3),
Taiwan $1.4 ($1.7), and Korea $1.3 ($1.4).  Advanced technology products exports were $24.9 billion in
November and imports were $35.7 billion, resulting in a deficit
of $10.7 billion.  November exports were $0.5 billion less than
the $25.5 billion in October, while November imports were $0.2
billion less than the $35.9 billion in October.  Revisions  Census Basis (not seasonally adjusted)  For October, exports of goods were revised up $0.3 billion and
imports of goods were revised up $0.1 billion. Goods carry-over
in November was $0.3 billion (0.3 percent) for exports and $1.6
billion (0.9 percent) for imports.  For October, revised export
carry-over was virtually zero. For October, revised import carry-
over was $0.2 billion (0.1 percent).  Balance of Payments Basis (seasonally adjusted)  For October, exports of goods were revised up $0.3 billion and
imports of goods were revised up $0.1 billion.  For October, exports of services were revised down $0.1 billion;
the revision was more than accounted for by downward revisions in
passenger fares and travel.  For October, imports of services
were revised down $0.1 billion, mostly reflecting a downward
revision in travel.  NOTICE  Upcoming Changes to the Real (chain-weighted dollar) Series  Effective with the release of the January 2012 statistics on
March 9, 2012, the U.S. Census Bureau (Census) will begin
seasonally adjusting selected export and import prices that
previously were not seasonally adjusted.  These prices are used
in calculating the chain-weighted dollar series (Exhibits 10 and
11).  Chain-weighted dollar statistics for 2010 and 2011 will be
revised to reflect this new procedure.  This change will improve the overall quality of the chain-
weighted dollar series by removing identified seasonal patterns.
This change also improves consistency between the Census chain-
weighted dollar data and the chain-weighted dollar data published
by the  Bureau of Economic Analysis  (BEA) in the National Income
and Product Accounts. For information on recent changes to BEA's
seasonal adjustment procedures, see ``Annual Revision of the
National Income and Product Accounts'' in the August 2011 Survey
