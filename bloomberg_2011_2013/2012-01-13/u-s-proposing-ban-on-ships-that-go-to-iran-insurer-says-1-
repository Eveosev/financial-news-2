The U.S. is proposing a rule banning
from its ports any vessel that sailed to  Iran , Syria or  North
Korea  within the prior 180 days, according to The London P&I
Club, a mutual marine-liability insurance company.  Shipowners, charterers or vessel operators would be
required to certify compliance with the proposed rule, London
P&I said in an  alert  on its website yesterday. U.S. federal
authorities would have to conduct enhanced inspections of
vessels that went to the three countries during the preceding
year, it said. Any ship breaching the ban would be barred from
U.S. ports for at least two years, according to the alert.  To contact the reporter on this story:
