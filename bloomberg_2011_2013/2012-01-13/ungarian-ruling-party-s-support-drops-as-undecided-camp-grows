Hungary’s governing party, Fidesz,
lost support this month as the number of undecided voters
swelled, Polling agency Szonda Ipsos said.  Backing for Fidesz among eligible voters fell to 16 percent
from 18 percent in December, reaching the lowest since records
started in 1998, the Budapest-based pollster Szonda Ipsos said
on its  website  today. The Socialist Party’s support was
unchanged at 11 percent, compared with a 1 percentage point
decline to 9 percent for the radical nationalist Jobbik, it
said. The number of undecided voters rose to 57 percent from 54
percent.  Among committed voters, Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s
Fidesz remained at 39 percent, the Socialists improved to 26
percent from 24 percent and Jobbik weakened to 22 percent from
24 percent. Politics Can Be Different, a green group, had 4
percent support among eligible voters and 9 percent among
committed respondents.  The Jan. 3-10 poll of 1,500 Hungarians had a 2.5 percentage
point margin of error. The next general elections are scheduled
for 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
