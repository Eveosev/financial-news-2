Italian bonds rose for a fourth day
as the nation prepared to sell as much as 4.75 billion euros
($6.1 billion) of bonds after European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi  said there are signs the economy is stabilizing.  Ten-year Italian yields headed for their biggest weekly
 decline  since Aug. 12. The securities rallied yesterday after
the nation sold 8.5 billion euros of one-year bills at less than
half the yield at the previous sale. The Mediterranean nation is
set to auction debt maturing in 2014 and 2018 today. Spanish
bonds rose and German bunds declined.  “There are good signs at the moment that periphery paper
is well accepted by the market,” said Annalisa Piazza, a fixed-
income analyst at Newedge Group in London. In today’s auction
“the amount on offer is relatively low. That should be well
received,” she said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s
“Countdown” with Linzie Janis.  The yield on 10-year Italian bonds fell 16 basis points, or
0.16 percentage point, to 6.47 percent at 8:36 a.m.  London  time.
The 5 percent security due March 2022 rose 1.05, or 10.50 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount to 89.87.  Italian two-year note yields dropped 33 basis points to
3.93, the least since Sept. 8. The rate on Spanish 10-year bonds
declined four basis points to 5.09 percent.  ECB Loans  Germany ’s benchmark 10-year bund yield rose one basis point
to 1.85 percent.  “There are tentative signs of stabilization of economic
activity at low levels,” Draghi said at a news conference in
 Frankfurt  yesterday, damping demand for the safest government
debt securities.  Central bank policy makers held the benchmark  interest rate 
at 1 percent after injecting a record 489 billion euros into the
financial system last month through the provision of three-year
loans.  German  government bonds  are little changed this year, after
gaining 9.7 percent in 2011, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Italian debt earned 1.7 percent this year including
reinvested interest, the fourth-highest return among the 26
sovereign-debt indexes. The top performing market was  Portugal ,
returning 5.4 percent, followed by Ireland, with a profit of 3.5
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
