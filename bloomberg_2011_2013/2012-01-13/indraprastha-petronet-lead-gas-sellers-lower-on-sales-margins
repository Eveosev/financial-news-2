Indraprastha Gas Ltd. (IGL)  and  Petronet
LNG Ltd. (PLNG)  led natural gas sellers in Mumbai trading lower after a
newspaper reported the industry regulator may start controlling
their sales margins.  Indraprastha Gas, which supplies the fuel in New Delhi,
 slumped  as much as 7.6 percent to 351.60 rupees, headed for its
lowest close since Feb. 8, 2010. It was at 353.35 rupees at
12:24 p.m. Petronet LNG, the country’s biggest gas importer,
 dropped  6 percent to 154.95 rupees, while  GAIL India Ltd. (GAIL) , the
largest distributor, fell 2.8 percent to 374.40 rupees. The
benchmark  Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  increased 0.5 percent.  The  Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board  may set the
marketing margins charged on gas sales, the Mint newspaper
reported today, citing a letter from the oil ministry to
 Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , operator of the nation’s biggest gas
deposit. The margins are currently decided between the buyer and
the seller, said  Deepak Pareek , a Mumbai-based analyst at
Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt.  “This news is driving the shares down as regulation here
may mean lower marketing margins,” Pareek, who recommends
buying Petronet shares and accumulate Indraprastha Gas.  Oil Secretary G.C. Chaturvedi couldn’t be reached for
comments after two calls to his office telephone.  Reliance charges a marketing margin of 13.5 cents per
million British thermal unit of gas it sells, Mint reported. The
shares gained 0.3 percent to 739.30 rupees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
