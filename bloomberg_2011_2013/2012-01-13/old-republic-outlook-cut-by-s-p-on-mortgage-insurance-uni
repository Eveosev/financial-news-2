Old Republic International Corp. (ORI)  had
its outlook lowered by  Standard & Poor’s  on the prospect that
its mortgage-insurance unit could be put into receivership by
state regulators.  Old Republic was cut to “negative” from “stable.” The
firm may incur “reputational damage that could impair its
ability to access the capital markets at a reasonable cost” if
regulators in North Carolina take action against the unit, the
ratings firm said today in a statement on Chicago-based Old
Republic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
