Radian Group Inc. (RDN) , the second-
largest U.S. mortgage insurer, advanced after saying sales
climbed in the fourth quarter as a measure of risk remained
below the limit set by some state regulators.  Radian  climbed  0.7 percent to $2.99 at 4:01 p.m. in New
York. The risk-to-capital ratio as of Dec. 31 was probably below
25-to-1, the Philadelphia-based firm said today in a statement
distributed by  Business Wire . New insurance written increased
about 71 percent from a year earlier to $6.5 billion.  The insurer is seeking to increase market share after rival
PMI Group Inc. filed for  bankruptcy protection  as state
regulators said it could no longer write new business. Mortgage
insurers compensate lenders for losses when borrowers default
and foreclosure sales fail to recoup costs.  “Our top priority at Radian is to write as much new, high-
quality mortgage insurance business as possible,” Chief
Executive Officer S.A. Ibrahim said in the statement. “We grew
new business significantly in the fourth quarter.”  The insurer is scheduled to release complete  results  for
the period on Feb. 23. Radian had about $500 million of holding-
company liquidity as of Dec. 31, according to today’s statement.
Radian shares declined by about 68 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
