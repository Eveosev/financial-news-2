Hungary needs to overhaul its
policies and relationships with foreign investors to help save
the economy from a “negative spiral” caused by high bond
yields, Zsigmond Jarai, head of the central bank’s Supervisory
Board, said in an interview with  Vilaggazdasag .  The government should modify its central bank law and “let
the Magyar Nemzeti Bank work,” Jarai, a former president of the
bank and an ex-finance minister under Prime Minister  Viktor Orban , told the newspaper.  The government must strike a more “conciliatory” tone in
its policies to help obtain aid from the  International Monetary
Fund  and the European Union, Jarai also told the newspaper.  Markets no longer tolerate the Hungarian government’s
“unorthodox” economic policy and investors expect predictable
steps preceded by consultations with those affected, without
favoring domestically-owned businesses, Jarai, who resigned as
head of the Budget Council watchdog this week, said in the
interview.  Hungary doesn’t face a default for the moment because it
has current account surplus, Jarai added in the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
