China’s stocks fell for a third day,
paring the benchmark index’s first weekly gain in two months, on
concern the slowing economy and government curbs on property
purchases will hurt earnings growth.  The Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.2 percent to 2,271.42
at 9:53 local time. Property developers and trainmakers led the
declines.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
