The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 10:12 a.m. local time.  The  IGBC Index (IGBC)  dropped 0.9 percent to 12,966.23, while the
Colcap Index dropped 0.7 percent to 1,575.04.  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  , Colombiaâ€™s biggest oil company,
dropped 1 percent to 4,275 pesos.  Colombia seeks to raise as much as $3 billion this year
from the sale of a stake in Ecopetrol by tapping sovereign
wealth funds and international investors, Mines and Energy
Minister Mauricio Cardenas said yesterday.  The government will sell as much as 3 percentage points of
its stake in Ecopetrol, pending congressional approval that is
probable in the first half of the year, Cardenas said in an
interview in Bogota. The government owns about 88.5 percent of
the company.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE)  , the Toronto-based
oil producer that operates fields in  Colombia , fell 1.9 percent
to 38,800 pesos.  Oil dropped to a three-week low after two European Union
officials said an embargo on Iranian crude imports may be
delayed for six months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
