David Warner  matched the record for
the fourth-fastest Test century as Australia neared India’s
first innings score of 161 without losing a wicket in the third
cricket Test in Perth.  Australia’s bowlers dismissed India in 60.2 overs before
Warner and Ed Cowan tore into the visitor’s bowlers, reaching
149-0 by the close of play. Warner, 25, reached his landmark in
just 69 balls to record the quickest century by an opening
batsman in Test history.  India, which lost the opening two Tests, lost its last six
wickets for 30 runs as  Ben Hilfenhaus  took four wickets and
Peter Siddle grabbed three against an opposition seeking to
avoid a seventh-straight defeat away from home soil.  Warner was on 104 runs and Cowan on 40 at the end of the
day.  Australia  trails India by 12 runs with 10 wickets
remaining.  Australia would regain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy contested
by the teams by avoiding defeat in either of the last two Tests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
