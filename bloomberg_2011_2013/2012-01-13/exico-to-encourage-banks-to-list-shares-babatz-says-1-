Mexico’s new rules for bank  capital
requirements  will give financial institutions an incentive to
list their shares, the nation’s securities regulator said.  Banks that issue subordinated debt will need to make it
convertible to publicly traded shares if they want it to count
toward their capital requirements, said Guillermo Babatz,
president of the National Securities and Banking Commission.
Mexico plans to adopt regulations in mid-2012 to become the
first country to adhere to the Basel III international accord on
bank capital requirements, he said.  “To be able to issue, you’ll have to list,” Babatz said.
“It’s a very powerful incentive.”  Adopting the Basel III accord won’t affect Mexican banks
much because the country’s rules already have substantial
capital requirements, Babatz said.  “The accelerated adoption of the Basel accord sends a
message of the strength of our system,” he said. “We think
that this year, it’s important to deliver that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
