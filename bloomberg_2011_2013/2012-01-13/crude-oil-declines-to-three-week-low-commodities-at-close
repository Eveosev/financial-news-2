The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
 Index (SPGSCI)  of 24 commodities fell 0.6 percent to close at 651.54 at
4:15 p.m. in  New York  as oil dropped to a three-week low.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials fell 0.7
percent to 1,541.869.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures declined for a fifth day in New York,
reaching a 28-month low, amid forecasts for warmer-than-normal
weather across most of the continental U.S. that would reduce
demand for heating fuels.  Natural gas for February delivery fell 2.7 cents to $2.67
per million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the lowest settlement price since Sept. 3, 2009. The
futures have declined 39 percent from a year ago.  U.K. natural gas for next month was little changed after
two days of gains as supplies increased even as colder weather
boosted heating demand.  Gas for next month slipped 0.75 pence to 54.45 pence a
therm in  London , according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s equal to $8.36 per million British thermal units.  BASE METALS  Copper fell for the first time in four days on signs that
 Europe ’s debt crisis may be worsening and as stockpiles
increased in  China , the world’s biggest buyer.  Copper futures for March delivery fell 0.3 percent to
settle at $3.637 a pound at 1:17 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
Prices ended the week up 5.9 percent, the biggest advance in
more than a month.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months dropped 0.1 percent to $8,000 a metric ton ($3.63 a
pound).  Aluminum, zinc, nickel, and lead also fell in London, while
tin rose.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Orange-juice  futures rebounded from the biggest two-day
slump since 2008 on renewed concern that a U.S. government probe
of imports from  Brazil  will tighten supplies. Futures prices
jumped 9.2 percent in the past two weeks, and on Jan. 10 reached
the highest level in almost five years.  Orange juice for March delivery rallied 3.6 percent to
settle at $1.846 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, after jumping as much as the exchange’s 20-cent limit, or
11 percent. The gain of 3.9 percent for the week was the fourth
straight advance.  Cocoa futures for March delivery fell 2.5 percent to close
at $2,269 a metric ton at 12:01 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New

23.84 cents a pound on ICE. The sweetener was up 2.4 percent for
the week.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery declined 3.7
percent to close at $2.2525 a pound in New York. The price rose

officials said an embargo on Iranian crude imports may be
postponed for six months.  Crude oil for February delivery fell 40 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $98.70 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
the lowest settlement since Dec. 21. Oil dropped 2.8 percent
this week.  Trafigura Beheer BV failed to buy North Sea Forties crude
at a higher price. No bids or offers were made for Urals in
northwest Europe and the Mediterranean.  Reported North Sea trading typically occurs during the
Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before the
session, Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was 37 cents a barrel
less than Dated Brent, unchanged from yesterday, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  OIL PRODUCTS  Heating oil fell for a third day as European Union
sanctions on  Iran  may be delayed to allow countries to find
alternative sources of crude, ensuring supply for refiners to
produce the fuel.  February-delivery heating oil declined 2.69 cents to settle
at $3.0272 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Futures
sank 1.4 percent this week.  Gasoline for February delivery rose 0.29 cent to $2.7342 a
gallon on the exchange.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold fell the most in two weeks, as a rebounding dollar and
slumping equity markets eroded demand for commodities.  Gold futures for February delivery fell 1 percent to settle
at $1,630.80 an ounce at 1:47 p.m. on the Comex in New York, the
biggest decline since Dec. 29. Prices have still climbed 0.9
percent this week.  Bullion will climb to $1,940 in 12 months, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. said in a report today, as it maintained a forecast
for commodities to gain 15 percent as economic growth in the
U.S. and China offsets the effect of a European recession.  Also on the Comex, silver futures for March delivery fell 2
percent to $29.522, an ounce in New York.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for

Palladium futures for March delivery fell 1 percent to $635.05
an ounce.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Corn and soybeans fell, capping the second straight weekly
declines, as beneficial weather boosted crop prospects in  South
America  and the dollar’s rally eroded demand for exports from
the U.S.  Corn futures for March delivery fell 2 percent to close at
$5.995 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices dropped 6.8 percent this week, the biggest decline since
the end of September, after the government projected yesterday
that U.S. reserves before this year’s harvest will be larger
than expected.  Soybean futures for March delivery fell 2.1 percent to
$11.5825 a bushel on the CBOT, the lowest close since Dec. 20.
The oilseed’s 3.2 percent slump for the week was the most since

and global beef demand climbed.  Cattle futures for April delivery climbed 0.9 percent to
close at $1.264 a pound at 1 p.m. on the  Chicago  Mercantile
Exchange. After the settlement, the price reached $1.2645 in
