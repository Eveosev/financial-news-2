Copper traders probably added to
wagers that the metal will rise, signaled by an increase in the
number of outstanding contracts at the same time prices gained.  Open interest in London Metal Exchange copper futures
climbed by 1,065 lots to 452,586 contracts in the week ended
Jan. 11, according to LME figures. Each lot represents 25 metric
tons of copper. The benchmark contract for three-month delivery
advanced 3.2 percent in the period.  An increase in open interest as prices rise suggests new
long positions, or bets on higher prices, according to Macquarie
Group Ltd. Open interest in LME copper is still down 9.2 percent
from Dec. 15.  Following are changes to market open interest for both LME
members and their clients for the six biggest industrial-metals
futures traded on the exchange. The figures were compiled by the
LME.  To contact the reporter on this story:
