Valerie Pecresse, the French
government spokeswoman, denied a report in Liberation newspaper
today that said  Nicolas Sarkozy  may include gay marriage in his
re-election platform.  Pecresse, a minister in the president’s  Union for a Popular
Movement  party, said in a posting on her official  Twitter
account  that Sarkozy “didn’t change his mind, he is not
favorable to gay marriage.”  Liberation  reported that Sarkozy, who is likely to announce
his intention to run for a second term in the coming weeks, may
include a marriage or a “civil union” equivalent to a full-
fledged marriage in his platform. The most conservative groups
within his party oppose this, the daily said.  Francois Hollande , the Socialist Party candidate and front-
runner before the two-round election in April and May, supports
homosexual marriage and will add it to his platform,  Manuel Valls , head of communication for the Socialist campaign, said on
RMC radio today.  In the 2007 race for president, Sarkozy opposed homosexual
marriage and the right of gays to adopt. He pledged to adopt a
“civil union,” a measure he has not implemented since.  To contact the reporter on this story:
