Bovespa futures dropped, a sign the
equity gauge may pare a second weekly gain, as lower metals
prices dimmed the outlook for Brazilian raw material producers.  Klabin SA (KLBN4) , Latin America’s biggest paper maker, may move
after it was cut to “market perform” from “outperform” at
Itau Corretora de Valores SA.  Tam SA (TAMM4) ,  Brazil ’s biggest airline
by market value, may be active after it said a proposed merger
with Chile’s  Lan Airlines SA (LAN)  would create $600 million to $700
million in synergies before depreciation and taxes by the fourth
year, 50 percent to 75 percent greater than initially estimated.  Bovespa futures fell 0.1 percent to 60,330 at 10:45 a.m. in
Sao Paulo. Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge is up 2.3 percent
this week. The real rose 0.1 percent to 1.7779 per  U.S. dollar .
The  Bloomberg Base Metals 3-Month Price Commodity Index  fell 0.7
percent.  “Despite a improvement we’ve seen this year so far,
investors are still not very comfortable about putting money in
riskier assets,” Gustavo Mendonca, who helps oversee 250
million reais ($141 million) as an economist at Oren
Investimentos, said by phone from  Rio de Janeiro .  The Bovespa has advanced 23 percent from a two-year low on
Aug. 8 as interest-rate cuts in Brazil and signs of progress in
solving  Europe ’s debt crisis buoyed demand for equities. The
gauge trades at 9.4 times analysts’ earnings estimates, which
compares with the ratio of 9.6 for MSCI Inc.’s measure of 21
developing nations’ equities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge sank 18 percent in 2011.  Traders  moved  6.05 billion reais in stocks in Sao Paulo
yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with a
daily average of 6.49 billion reais in 2011, according to data
from the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
