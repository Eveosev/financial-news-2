HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  hired former U.S.
Treasury Undersecretary  Stuart Levey , the department’s top
official for fighting terrorist funding, as chief legal officer.  Levey, 48, will work with Richard Bennett, group general
counsel, who will retire at the end of this year after more than
33 years at the lender, London-based HSBC said in a statement
today. Levey, who resigned his government post of undersecretary
for terrorism and financial intelligence a year ago, will report
to Chief Executive Officer Stuart Gulliver.  “His experience dealing with international financial and
legal issues is highly relevant to a global bank such as HSBC,”
Gulliver said in today’s statement.  He headed an office that oversees the Treasury’s efforts to
stop illicit international funding and enforces economic and
trade sanctions. During a tenure that spanned both the Bush and
Obama administrations, Levey helped lead the American effort to
staunch the flow of money intended to help al-Qaeda and regimes
in Iran and  North Korea .  To contact the reporter on this story:
