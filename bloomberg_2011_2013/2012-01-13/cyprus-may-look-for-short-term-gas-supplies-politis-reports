Cyprus may look for short-term
natural-gas supplies because  Noble Energy Inc. (NBL)  may not be able
to supply demand before 2017,  Politis  reports today.  Noble probably will submit a binding timetable later this
month, the Nicosia-based newspaper reported, without saying how
it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
