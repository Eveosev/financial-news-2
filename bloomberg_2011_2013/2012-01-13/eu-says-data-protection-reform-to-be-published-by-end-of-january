European Union plans to overhaul the
region’s 16-year-old data-protection rules will be published by
the end of the month, an EU spokesman said.  “The data-protection reform is well on track for adoption
by the commission by the end of January,” said  Matthew Newman ,
a spokesman for the EU’s Justice Commissioner  Viviane Reding .  The bill will include stricter sanctions and equip national
data-protection authorities with powers to levy fines of as much
as 1 million euros ($1.3 million), or 5 percent of a company’s
annual sales, according to an early draft of the rules obtained
by Bloomberg News last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
