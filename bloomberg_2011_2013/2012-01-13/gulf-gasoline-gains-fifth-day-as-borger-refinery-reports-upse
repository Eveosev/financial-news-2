Gulf Coast gasoline rose a fifth day
after an upset at  ConocoPhillips (COP) ’s Borger,  Texas , refinery added
to other outages in the region that may curtail fuel production.  Conoco reported a process upset yesterday at the 154,000-
barrel-a-day plant, according to a filing with state regulators.
 Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  flared gases at its Beaumont refinery in
Texas, according to a recorded message on a community hot line.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Gulf Coast (MOSGC87P)  narrowed 0.75 cent to 1 cent a gallon versus futures
traded at 3:55 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose
1.04 cents to $2.7242 a gallon.  Conoco shut a catalytic cracker and an alkylation unit at
the Alliance refinery in Louisiana,  Andy Lipow , president of
Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston, said in an e-mail Jan. 9.
Catalytic crackers at Conoco’s Sweeny plant in Texas and
Marathon Petroleum Corp.’s Garyville, Louisiana, refinery also
shut, according to Lipow.  Money managers boosted long positions in gasoline to the
highest level in records going back to 2006. Bullish bets
advanced by 3,929 futures and options combined, or 5.8 percent,
to 71,282 in the week ended January 10, according to the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s Commitments of Traders
report today.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor widened 0.13 cent to 1.88 cents a gallon.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Chicago  tumbled 5 cents
to a 14-cent discount versus futures, the lowest level since
June 23.  Refiners in the Midwest processed the most crude last week
since July 2000, according to the Energy Department. Stockpiles
of the fuels in the region increased to the highest level since
March 4, the agency reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
