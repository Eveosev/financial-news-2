Billionaire Gennady Timchenko’s
construction company OAO Stroytransgaz may lose part of a 28
billion-ruble ($886 million) contract to build a power station
in  St. Petersburg ,  Kommersant  reported.  The city government may cancel plans for Stroytransgaz to
build a second unit of the South-West power plant because of
delays in constructing the first unit, the Moscow-based daily
reported without saying where it got the information.  Stroytransgaz’s press office in Moscow wasn’t available for
comment when Bloomberg News called.  To contact the reporter on this story:
