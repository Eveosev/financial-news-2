Good afternoon, and welcome back to the Griddle, a menu of fortified items for the busy person's media diet. Much of the 2012 U.S. presidential election cycle has focused on one word -- jobs -- and the rival approaches that might best relieve the nation's 13 million unemployed. Employers are watching. Vestas, the world's largest wind-turbine manufacturer, announced a major restructuring this week, eliminating 2,335 jobs. The Danish company has threatened to fire an additional 1,600 U.S. workers if Congress does not extend a wind-industry tax credit. That treatment is a blow to the president's 'green' bona fides and puts Republicans in the position of having to choose between jobs and using federal spending to keep them. CEO Ditlev Engel  told  Bloomberg News he'll take his cues from  Washington : "We will evaluate it during 2012 depending entirely on how the political situation evolves."
