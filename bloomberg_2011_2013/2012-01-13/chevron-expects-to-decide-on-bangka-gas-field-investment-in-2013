Chevron Corp. (CVX)  plans to make a final
 investment decision  on its offshore Bangka gas field in
 Indonesia ’s East Kalimantan province in 2013, according to
BPMigas, the nation’s oil and gas regulator.  Chevron will need to sign contracts with BPMigas including
natural gas sales accords and an extension of a production
sharing contract in the Makassar Straits before making its final
investment decision, BPMigas Chairman R. Priyono said in a
 statement  posted on the regulator’s website today. Gareth
Johnstone, a spokesman for Chevron in  Singapore , did not
immediately comment when contacted by e-mail and phone today.
The company is “continuing to advance” the Bangka project
through its design phase, Chevron said Dec. 21.  Indonesia,  Southeast Asia ’s largest crude producer, is
struggling to stem a decline in output from aging oil and gas
fields that led to the country withdrawing from the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries in 2008.  “The project can’t be delayed because it is very
strategic,” said Priyono. “A one-day delay could cause a loss
of tens of billions rupiah for the government.”  Bangka, which is one of three sections of Chevron’s deep
sea natural gas project off East Kalimantan, may start
production in 2015, the regulator said in a Dec. 16
presentation. The field is expected to have peak production of
110 million cubic feet a day, Gde Pradnyana, a BPMigas
spokesman, said Dec. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
