KanAm Grund KAG (KANGRND)  is in talks with
Malaysian investment fund  Permodalan Nasional Bhd. (PNB)  over the sale
of four London office buildings valued at about 1 billion pounds
($1.54 billion).  The German real estate fund is in discussions with other
bidders and “a deal could be done in a couple more weeks,”
Michael Birnbaum, a spokesman for Frankfurt-based KanAm, said.  The buildings are the European Bank of Reconstruction &
Development’s head office next to Liverpool Street train
station, the U.K. headquarters of Thomson Reuters in  Canary
Wharf , Deutsche Bank AG’s U.K. headquarters on London Wall and
an office building at 90 High Holborn.  Calls to PNB’s communications office seeking comment
weren’t immediately answered and the company didn’t reply to an
e-mail.  The  London  assets are part of KanAm’s suspended 3.97
billion-euro ($5.1 billion) Grundinvest fund.  The talks were reported by Property Week earlier this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
