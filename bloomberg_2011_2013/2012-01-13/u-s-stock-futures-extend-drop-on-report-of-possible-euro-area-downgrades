U.S. stock-index futures extended
losses following a report that several euro-region countries may
face imminent credit downgrades by  Standard & Poorâ€™s .  Futures on the  S&P 500  expiring in March fell 0.7 percent
to 1,283 at 9:04 a.m. in  New York  following the report by Dow
Jones Newswires, which cited European Union sources. Earlier
losses came after JPMorgan Chase & Co. reported a drop in
profit.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
