The U.S.  trade deficit  widened more
than forecast in November as American exports declined and
companies stepped up imports of crude oil and automobiles.  The gap expanded 10.4 percent to $47.8 billion, the widest
since June, from a $43.3 billion shortfall in October, Commerce
Department figures showed today in Washington. The deficit was
larger than any of the estimates in a Bloomberg News survey of 75
economists.  The U.S. import bill was driven by demand for higher-priced
crude oil at the same time American companies tempered orders for
consumer goods on concern household spending will cool early this
year. Exports from the U.S. declined to a four-month low,
depressed by a drop in shipments to  Europe .  “Domestic demand is a bit stronger than external demand as
global growth weakens,” said Jeremy Lawson, a senior U.S.
economist at BNP Paribas in New York. “The question is whether
U.S. consumption can be maintained in the first part of the year
post-Christmas. There are a lot of headwinds.”  The trade gap was  projected  to widen to $45 billion from an
initially reported $43.5 billion in October, according to the
median forecast in the Bloomberg survey. Estimates ranged from
deficits of $41.8 billion to $47.6 billion. The November increase
from a month earlier was the biggest since May.  Stock-index futures held losses after JPMorgan Chase & Co.
said its profit dropped 23 percent. The contract on the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index expiring in March fell 0.6 percent to 1,284.6
at 8:48 a.m. in  New York .  More Imports  Imports climbed 1.3 percent to a six-month high of $225.6
billion in November. The value of crude oil purchases increased
to $27.3 billion from $26 billion. The price per barrel climbed
for the first time in six months, to $102.50 from $98.84.
Refiners imported 266.2 million barrels of oil in November, more
than the 263.2 million in the previous month.  The trade shortfall excluding all petroleum products widened
to $20.1 billion from $19.1 billion in October.  In December, the cost of petroleum eased, helping keep a lid
on import prices. The Labor Department said today that its
measure of the cost of  imported goods  fell 0.1 percent in
December after a 0.8 percent jump a month earlier.  While the Commerce Department’s figures showed  consumer
goods  imports declined in November, demand for capital goods made
overseas climbed to a record $43.8 billion. Automobile imports
rose $816 million in November to $22.3 billion.  Exports Decline  U.S. shipments abroad dropped 0.9 percent to $177.8 billion
even as exports of consumer goods increased to a record $15.7
billion.  Demand for U.S.-made goods in emerging countries may help
provide a buffer against any slowdown in Europe’s economy
stemming from its debt crisis or slower growth in  China .  Goods exports to newly industrialized countries climbed in
November. The trade gap with China declined 4.3 percent to $26.9
billion. Exports to China climbed to the highest since December
2010, showing sustained demand from the nation for U.S.-made
goods.  “Where we’re growing, we’re redeploying from more mature
economies into  emerging markets  and we see good growth there
across all our markets,  Middle East , China, parts of  Asia ,  India ,
 Latin America ,” Lisa McDermott, chief financial officer at  Pall
Corp. (PLL) , said at a Jan. 11 investor conference. The Port
Washington, New York-based maker of water purification systems
reported 27 percent revenue growth at its Asian industrial
segment in the quarter ended Oct. 31 from a year earlier.  European Union  The goods deficit with European Union nations widened 21.6
percent to $9.7 billion. A $4.7 billion U.S. shortfall with
 Germany  was the biggest since October 2005.  After eliminating the influence of prices, which renders the
figures used to calculate gross domestic product, the trade
deficit increased to $47.5 billion from $44 billion. The number
was wider than the $46 billion gap averaged in the third quarter.
Trade contributed 0.4 percentage point to growth from July to
September.  The  dollar’s decline  through most of 2011 may help maintain
demand for American-made equipment. From the end of 2010 through
a low on July 26, the dollar fell 5 percent against the
currencies of U.S. major trade partners tracked by the  Federal
Reserve . The drop makes American goods cheaper abroad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
