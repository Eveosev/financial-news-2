Colombia ’s government, which has
drawn investment in gold projects from billionaire  Eike Batista 
and AngloGold Ashanti Ltd., is willing to debate the level of
mining taxes, Mines Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  said.  “My ideal scenario from the point of view of the sector is
to preserve the status quo -- stability,” Cardenas said in
Bogota in an interview Jan. 12. “We are making that case and we
hope that case is persuasive, but we need debate and we’re open
to the debate.”  Rising demand for the metal and other commodities has
prompted congressmen including Senator Milton Rodriguez, a
member of a committee overseeing natural resources, to propose
tax increases.  Gold is “the most contentious issue” among those lobbying
for higher taxes, Cardenas said. Royalties are “at a reasonable
level,” he said.  Gold deposits in Colombia once prized by Spanish
conquistadors have draw investment from companies including
Batista’s AUX Canada Acquisition Inc. and  AngloGold (ANG) , which plans
to invest $400 million in Colombian exploration in the next
three years. Gold has risen 18 percent in a year.  Colombia must resolve issues that limit expansion of the
industry, including government consultations with indigenous
groups in areas affected by mining and environmental studies.
Those are justifiable delays because expansion of the industry
has to “be done in the right way,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
