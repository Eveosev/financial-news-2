Czech shares fell, reversing earlier
gains, and the koruna weakened as reports that several European
countries may face imminent credit downgrades drove investors
from riskier assets worldwide.  The  PX (PX)  equity gauge slid 0.8 percent to 890.6 at its 4:20
p.m. close in  Prague , according to data on the Prague Stock
Exchange  website . The benchmark earlier increased as much as 0.9
percent. The Czech currency depreciated 0.4 percent to 25.651
per euro, reversing a gain of as much 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
