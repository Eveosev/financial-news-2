American sanctions on Iran could
hurt Japanese banks that do business in the U.S., Finance
Minister  Jun Azumi  said.  “It’s possible that  Japan ’s financial institutions will
have a big blow” and exemptions should be made, Azumi said at a
press conference in Tokyo today. President Barack Obama’s
measures would deny access to the U.S. financial system for any
overseas bank that conducts business with the Central Bank of
Iran.  Asked whether his promise yesterday to reduce Japan’s oil
imports from Iran was a reflection of his opinion rather than
government policy, Azumi said there is no difference in opinion
among Cabinet members and that all countries need to show a
united response to denounce Iran’s nuclear program.  Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura said yesterday the
government hasn’t made a final decision on cutting Iranian oil
imports, and that Azumi’s pledge “is just one of several
opinions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
