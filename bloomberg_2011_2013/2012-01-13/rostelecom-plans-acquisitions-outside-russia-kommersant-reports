OAO Rostelecom (RTKM)  plans to buy stakes
in network service and  Internet providers  in Armenia in the
state-controlled telecommunications company’s first acquisitions
outside  Russia ,  Kommersant  said, citing people it didn’t name.  Rostelecom plans to spend $22.5 million to buy 75 percent
of GNC-Alfa, the owner of 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) of fiber-
optic network in Armenia and is looking at internet provider
Ucom in the former Soviet republic, Kommersant said. The
acquisitions would give Rostelecom 13 percent of Armenia’s
broadband Internet market, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
