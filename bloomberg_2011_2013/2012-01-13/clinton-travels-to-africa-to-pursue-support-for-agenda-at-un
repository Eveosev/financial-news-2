Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton 
plans to travel to Togo, Liberia, Cote d’Ivoire and Cape Verde
on Jan. 16 to Jan. 17.  Clinton will be the first U.S. secretary of state to visit
Togo, where she will congratulate President Faure Gnassingbe on
the country’s recent election to a non-permanent seat on the
United Nations Security Council, the State Department said today
in a statement.  Togo will hold the seat this year and next year, as the
U.S. and its allies seek to mobilize international opinion
against Syria for its crackdown on protests. The U.S. is also
trying to tighten the economic noose around  Iran , to dissuade
the country from pursuing its nuclear program.  In Liberia, Clinton will attend the inauguration of
President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. In Cote d’Ivoire, Clinton will
meet with President Alassane Dramane Ouattara to support the
country’s national reconciliation and democratic development
after contested legislative elections in December.  Clinton will focus on counter-narcotics, good governance,
economic policies and development in  Cape Verde , according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
