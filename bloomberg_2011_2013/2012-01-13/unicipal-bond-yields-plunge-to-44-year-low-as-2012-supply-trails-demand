U.S. municipal-bond yields dropped
to the lowest in more than four decades as issuers were slow to
sell enough debt this month to meet demand after the asset class
beat Treasuries and U.S. stocks last year.  The  interest rate  on 20-year general-obligation bonds with
an average Moody’s Investors Service rating of Aa2, the third-
highest, fell 0.21 percentage point to 3.62 percent in the week
ended Jan. 12, according to a Bond Buyer index. That’s the
lowest since April 1967, when  Lyndon B. Johnson  was president.  “We’re in the middle right now of just a powerful rally,”
said Joe Deane, who manages $16 billion as head of municipal-
bond investments at Pacific Investment Management Co. in New
York. “You have to let the new-issue market begin to put supply
back into the marketplace because, at the moment, the market is
on the tight side.”  Municipal interest rates are also falling as  tax revenue 
rebounds following the 18-month recession that ended in 2009,
and as governments close $500 billion of budget deficits. State
and local-government tax revenue rose 4.1 percent in the third
quarter, the eighth straight gain, the Census Bureau said.  In the two weeks ending Jan. 6, states and municipalities
issued $1.27 billion of bonds, the lowest two-week total since
January 2008, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  The amount of local-government debt scheduled for sale in
the next 30 days dropped to about $4.2 billion, down 37 percent
from a one-month high on Jan. 10, Bloomberg  data  show.  At the same time, investors are funneling money into the
$3.7 trillion market at a faster clip. U.S. municipal-bond funds
added about $1.1 billion in the week to Jan. 11, the most since
March 2010, Lipper US Fund Flows data show.  The  yield  on top-rated 30-year municipal bonds fell the
past five days, to 3.39 percent at 4 p.m.  New York  time
yesterday, according to Bloomberg Valuation Index data.  The municipal market returned 11.2 percent in 2011,
compared with 9.8 percent for Treasuries, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data. The  Standard & Poor’s  500
index was little changed for the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
