North Korea  test-fired short-range
missiles off its eastern coast two days ago, South Korea’s
Defense Ministry said.  Three recently developed KN-02 missiles, which have a range
of about 120 kilometers (75 miles), were fired on Jan. 11, said
a ministry official who declined to be named, citing military
policy.  Japan ’s Sankei newspaper originally reported the
launches, citing unidentified Japanese government officials.  North Korea has now conducted two such tests since the Dec.
17 death of leader  Kim Jong Il  and the succession of his son,
Kim Jong Un. The younger Kim needs the support of senior
political and military leaders more than twice his age to retain
control.  “These test fires are of concern but I am personally not
alarmed,” said Daniel Pinkston, a senior analyst at the
 International Crisis Group  in Seoul. “I don’t get too excited
about these in the context of their intercontinental ballistic
missiles and nuclear capabilities.”  The communist nation operates under a military-first policy
and allocates a third of its budget to maintain its 1.2 million
troops. It has twice detonated a nuclear device and has more
than 250 long-range artillery installations along the world’s
most fortified border in reach of the Seoul area and its 23
million citizens.  To contact the reporter on this story:
