Mauritius’s stocks gauge is expected
to fall to the weakest since December by the end of the first
quarter as  Europe  curbs spending because of its debt crisis,
according to CIM Stockbrokers Ltd.  The 38-member SEMDEX index is expected to fall 1.5 percent
by March 30 to about 1,860, the weakest level since Dec. 22,
Kishen Nadassen, a senior research analyst at the brokerage,
said by phone today from the capital, Port Louis.  “More European countries are getting ready for austerity

percent of visitors for the 11 months through November,
