Mexico ’s peso appears to have become
divorced “a little” from the country’s economic fundamentals,
Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade said.  The peso has weakened 14.1 percent against the dollar in
the past six months, the worst performer of seven major Latin
American currencies.  “We should focus on making sure the market remains liquid
and that it remains deep,” Meade said at an event in Mexico
City today. “Because what we’ve seen is that promising to
defend a level is not a bet that I think is worth it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
