Green Exchange LLC quadrupled the
volume of emission allowances and credits it traded, boosted by
a surge in the European Union.  The bourse, which has operations in London and  New York ,
handled 451.8 million metric tons, compared with 104.5 million
in 2010, according to data in an e-mailed report. EU-allowance
futures were 83 percent of the 2011 total, the data show.  The exchange’s market share rose to an average 5.8 percent
from 1.6 percent in 2010, GreenX said. The market leader is  ICE (ICE) 
Futures Europe, which handled 5.4 billion tons of EU carbon
futures last year, according to its data.  GreenX volumes picked up this week after a slow start to
the year, Sara Stahl, managing director of global marketing in
London and a former ICE executive, said today by phone.
“Yesterday, we had a strong day,” when volumes were 2.4
million tons compared with last year’s average of about 1.8
million a day, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
