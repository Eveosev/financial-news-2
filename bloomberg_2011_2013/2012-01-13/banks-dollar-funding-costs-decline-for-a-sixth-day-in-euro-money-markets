The cost for banks to borrow in
dollars in European money markets kept near the lowest levels in
more than four months amid signs Europe’s sovereign debt crisis
is easing.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 81 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 11:18 a.m. in
London, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The measure is
heading for the biggest weekly decline since September after
tightening from minus 101 basis points on Jan. 6.  Borrowing costs for Spain and  Italy  fell at debt auctions
as  European Central Bank  President  Mario Draghi  said yesterday
his strategy to avert the region’s debt crisis is working. Since
December, the ECB has lent euro-area banks 489 billion euros
($626 billion) over three years, cut the cost of emergency
dollar funding and relaxed criteria for loan collateral.  “There’s less liquidity stress for the banking system,”
said Alessandro Giansanti, an analyst at ING Bank NV in
Amsterdam. “It’s the continuation of the positive trend that
started with the new conditions for the ECB dollar tender.”  A measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another in
 Europe  fell to the lowest in almost two months. The Euribor-OIS
spread, the difference between the borrowing benchmark and
overnight index swaps, was at 88 basis points. That’s the
smallest gap since Nov. 17, and compares with 90 yesterday.  The one-year basis swap was 72 basis points less than
Euribor, from minus 74 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Overnight deposits  at the European Central Bank rose to a
record 490 billion euros yesterday, compared with 470.6 billion
euros on Jan. 11, according to the Frankfurt-based lender.  Three-month Euribor (EUR003M) , the rate banks say they pay for three-
month loans in euros, fell for a seventeenth day, the longest
declining streak since January 2010. The rate fell to 1.231
percent from 1.245 percent yesterday.  One-week Euribor (EUR001W)  fell for
a fifteenth day to 0.483 percent from 0.497 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
