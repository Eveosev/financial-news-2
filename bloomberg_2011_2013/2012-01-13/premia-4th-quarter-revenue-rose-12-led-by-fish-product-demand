AS Premia Foods (PRF1T) , the largest Baltic
frozen-food producer, said fourth-quarter sales rose 12 percent
from a year earlier to 20 million euros ($25.7 million), helped
by growing demand for fish products.  Full-year sales reached 88.3 million euros, exceeding
Premiaâ€™s own sales estimate by 3.3 percent, the Tallinn-based
company said in a regulatory statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
