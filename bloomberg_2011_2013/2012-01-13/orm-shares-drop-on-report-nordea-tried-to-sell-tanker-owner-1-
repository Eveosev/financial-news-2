Torm A/S (TORM) , which has agreed with
banks on a temporary deferral of its debt repayments, fell the
most in seven weeks in Copenhagen trading after a newspaper said
Nordea Bank AB had tried to find a buyer for the tanker company.  Torm’s stock fell as much as 11 percent, the most since
Nov. 23, after Oslo-based Finansavisen reported the bank had
tried to broker a deal for shipping billionaire  John Fredriksen 
to fold Torm into his Frontline 2012 Ltd. company.  Torm, which lost 90 percent of its market value last year,
said in November it may have to sell as much as $300 million of
new stock to boost capital as tanker rates have plunged. RS
Platou AS was also part of a potential deal to sell Hellerup-
based Torm, the newspaper reported, without saying how it
obtained the information.  “We can’t comment on what our clients do or not do,”
Peter Anker, chief executive officer of RS Platou, said by phone
today. “I expect to see a lot of consolidation and
restructuring in shipping in general, especially in the tanker
market, where the outlook is challenging.”  Torm declined 0.28 krone, or 6.1 percent, to 4.3 kroner at
1:44 p.m. in the Danish capital.  Tor Olav Troiem, an aide to Fredriksen, declined to comment
when contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
