Slovakia, the second-poorest euro-
region member, will be downgraded one level by  Standard &
Poor’s , according to a person familiar with the matter.  The rating company will cut its assessment of the east
European country to ’A’, the sixth-best grade, from ’A+’, said
the person who declined to be identified because the information
isn’t public.  Slovakia, which adopted the euro three years ago, was among
15 euro-sharing countries that have been put on a review for
possible downgrade by S&P on Dec. 5 as the region’s debt crisis
entered its third year. Moody’s Investors Agency on Dec. 23
maintained the nation’s rating at A1, its fifth-best grade.  The country two days ago sold 1 billion euros ($1.27
billion) in five-year euro-denominated bonds at a 3.05
percentage point surcharge over the corresponding mid-swap rate,
or more expensive than non-euro-member  Poland , whose S&P rating
is currently worse by two grades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
