The Canadian Wheat Board said it
will offer new grain-marketing programs for farmers this year,
before a law goes into effect ending the agency’s nearly 70-
year-old monopoly.  Farmers who want to sell their grain may be able to use
futures, cash contracts or price pooling through the board, the
Winnipeg-based group said today in an e-mailed statement. Since
1943, farmers in  Canada ’s main growing region have been required
to sell all their wheat and barley for human consumption to the
board. Canada’s Conservative government passed a law last month
to open the market Aug. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
