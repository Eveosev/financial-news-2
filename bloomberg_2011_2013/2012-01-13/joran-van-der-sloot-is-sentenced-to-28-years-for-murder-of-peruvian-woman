Joran van der Sloot, the Dutchman
who pleaded guilty to killing 21-year-old Peruvian student
Stephany Flores, was sentenced in  Lima  to 28 years in prison.  The court today sentenced Van der Sloot, who pleaded guilty
on Jan. 11 to strangling Flores with both hands in a hotel room
after he met her in a Lima casino in May 2010, according to the
televised hearing today. Prosecutors had requested a 30-year
prison sentence. The court also ordered Van der Sloot to pay the
Flores family damages of 200,000 soles ($74,239).  Van der Sloot, 24, was extradited from  Chile  where he was
arrested after he fled  Peru . He has said he killed Flores after
she saw material on his laptop about the unsolved disappearance
of Natalee Holloway, prosecutors said.  Holloway, an American teenager, disappeared in May 2005
just before she was to fly home to  Alabama  from a vacation on
the Caribbean island of  Aruba . She was last seen with Van der
Sloot and two other men, authorities said.  Van der Sloot said in a 2008 video he disposed of the body
of Holloway on Aruba. He later denied he had anything to do with
the disappearance of the 18-year-old. Dutch prosecutors dropped
a case against him.  The Dutchman has been charged in the U.S. with wire fraud
and extortion for allegedly soliciting money in 2010 on promises
he would reveal the location of Holloway’s remains in Aruba and
circumstances of her death.  Following today’s hearing, Van der Sloot told the court he
reserved the right to appeal the ruling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
