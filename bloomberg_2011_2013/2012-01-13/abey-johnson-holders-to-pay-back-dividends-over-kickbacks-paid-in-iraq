Mabey & Johnson Ltd. ’s owner was
ordered by a U.K. court to pay 131,201 pounds ($201,370) in
dividends gained after the bridge builder paid kickbacks to win
contracts from  Saddam Hussein ’s Iraqi government.  Mabey Engineering Holdings Ltd. will repay “sums it
received through share dividends derived from contracts won
through unlawful conduct,” the  Serious Fraud Office  said in an
e-mailed statement.  Two former directors of the closely held U.K. construction
company were found guilty last year of paying more than 420,000
euros ($538,600) to  Iraq  to win contracts, in violation of
United Nations sanctions against the country.  Mabey & Johnson alerted the SFO in 2008 of “irregularities
it had identified as a result of an internal investigation” and
was convicted of corruption and breaches of UN sanctions in
2009, the fraud office said.  “The company is viewed by the SFO as having conducted
itself in an exemplary way through its self-referral, extensive
cooperation with the authorities and the transformation of the
company,” the SFO said in the statement.  Mabey Group didn’t immediately respond to a call or e-mails
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
