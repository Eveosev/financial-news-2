Defunct  Enron Corp (ENRNQ) .’s creditors have
received $21.8 billion in cash and stock so far, with money from
lawsuits and settlements helping to give general unsecured
creditors a payback three times higher than the estate had
projected, a report shows.  Once the biggest U.S. energy trader, Houston-based Enron
filed for bankruptcy in 2001 and won approval of a liquidation
plan in 2004. The 53 percent payback to general unsecured
creditors was triple the 17 percent recovery estimated in the
plan, according to a report by  Enron Creditors Recovery Corp. ,
set up to liquidate the company’s remaining operations and
assets.  Enron investors in December 2008 began receiving their
share of $7.2 billion from settlements with the failed energy
trader’s lenders, auditors and directors.  A judge that year approved a $1.7 billion settlement with
 Citigroup Inc. (C) , sued by investors as part of a move to hold
lenders liable for the fraud that destroyed the company.
Citigroup also agreed to give up an estimated $4.3 billion in
claims against Enron to settle the allegations about its role in
the company’s collapse. JPMorgan Chase & Co., another former
Enron lender, said in 2005 it would pay $2.2 billion to resolve
litigation.  The creditors’ payout includes $267 million of interest,
 capital gains  and dividends, according to yesterday’s report.  Lay is Dead  Enron, then run by Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey Skilling 
and Chairman  Kenneth Lay , filed for bankruptcy after restating
$586 million in earnings. Its shares lost $68 billion in value
from their peak in 2000 to its bankruptcy filing. More than
5,000 Enron employees were fired and about $1 billion in
retirement money was lost. Skilling is in prison and Lay is
dead.  More than $780 million in total fees were approved in 2004
for advisers in the three-year Enron bankruptcy, at the time the
second-largest in U.S. history after WorldCom Inc.  Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) , which collapsed in 2008, set the record
as America’s most costly bankruptcy in 2010, and now has paid
managers and advisers about $1.5 billion.  Lehman is embarking on a $65 billion liquidation plan and
has estimated it will pay the average creditor less than 18
cents on the dollar.  The Enron recovery corporation has stored 2,600 boxes of
documents and destroyed at least 43,000 boxes in accordance with
court orders, according to the report. Litigation documents are
stored on electronic tape media.  The Citigroup suit is Enron Creditors Recovery Corp. v.
Citigroup Inc., 03-9266, and the bankruptcy case is In re Enron
Corp., 01-16034,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New
York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
