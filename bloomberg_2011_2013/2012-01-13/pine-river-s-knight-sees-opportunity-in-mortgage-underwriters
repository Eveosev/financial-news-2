Richard Knight, head of business
development at Pine River Capital Management LP, said the hedge
fund sees relative-value trading opportunities in banks that
underwrite mortgages and other financial-services companies.  “We think our mortgage expertise gives an edge in mortgage
REITs, looking at the banks that underwrite mortgages, in
servicers and payment processors,” Knight said today in an
interview with Bloomberg Television. “We see opportunities in
looking at the spread between winners and losers.”  Relative-value managers aim to profit from the pricing
differences between securities. Pine River Capital Management,
based in  Minnetonka ,  Minnesota , has $5.4 billion in assets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
