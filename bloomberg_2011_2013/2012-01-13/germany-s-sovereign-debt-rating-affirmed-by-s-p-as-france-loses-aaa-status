Germany , Belgium, Estonia, Finland,
Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands had their ratings
affirmed by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services as  France  lost

outlook, S&P said in a statement. Germany and Slovakia are the
only two of the 16 Eurozone countries in the S&P review with a
stable outlook, the rest have a negative outlook.   European leaders’ attempts to address economic woes hasn’t
“produced a breakthrough of sufficient size and scope to fully
address the Eurozone’s financial problems,” S&P said. The
region continues to face tightening credit conditions among
other problems, S&P said.   Cyprus,  Italy , Portugal, and Spain were cut by two notches
S&P said. The long-term ratings on Austria, Malta, Slovakia, and
Slovenia were cut one notch. Portugal and Cyprus are now below
investment grade, or in junk status.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
