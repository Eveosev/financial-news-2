OAO Acron (AKRN) , a Russian fertilizer
producer, offered to buy back stock from investors that oppose a
share cancellation that’s part of its reorganization at almost
16 percent less than yesterday’s closing price in Moscow.  The price of buyback will be 1,143 rubles ($36.10) a share, 
Acron said today in a statement. The shares dropped as much as 
2 percent, reversing gains, before trading down 1.1 percent at
1,338.9 rubles a share at 1:50 p.m.  Acron scheduled a shareholder meeting on Feb. 27 to
consider its reorganization through a takeover of its Granit
unit, which holds about 15 percent of the fertilizer maker’s
treasury shares, the company said Dec. 28.  The fertilizer producer will offer to buy back stock from
investors who will vote against the reorganization or abstain
from voting, Acron said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
