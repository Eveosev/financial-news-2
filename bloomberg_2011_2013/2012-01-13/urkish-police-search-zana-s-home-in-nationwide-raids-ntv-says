Turkish police detained 32 people
and searched the home of lawmaker Leyla Zana in nationwide raids
as part of an investigation into what prosecutors say is the
urban arm of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, NTV  reported .  The raids took place at about 100 addresses in 16 cities
including Istanbul, Ankara and Diyarbakir, and offices of the
pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party were among the targets,
NTV reported.  The detentions were the latest in a series of police
actions against people are suspected of membership in the Union
of Communities in Kurdistan, or KCK. The government says the KCK
is the urban branch of the PKK, which is listed as a terrorist
organization by  Turkey , the U.S. and the European Union.  Zana, who spent 9 1/2 years in prison for supporting the
PKK, was elected to parliament in June. Police took documents
and a computer from her Diyarbakir home, NTV said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
