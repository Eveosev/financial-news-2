SMA Solar Technology AG (S92) ,  Germany ’s
biggest solar-energy company by market value, fell the most in
two months in  Frankfurt  trading as profit missed estimates.  SMA Solar (S92)  slid 11 percent to close at 48.09 euros, the
steepest decline since Nov. 15. The company posted preliminary
2011 earnings before interest and tax of 240 million euros ($308
million), missing the 259 million-euro average estimate of 15
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Suppliers of solar-power equipment, including SMA Solar and
the U.S.’s  Power-One Inc. (PWER) , saw profit squeezed last year as
subsidy cuts and lower prices weighed on sales. Niestetal-based
SMA, whose inverters turn power from solar panels into a current
for the grid, reported 2011 revenue of about 1.7 billion euros.  “The weak Ebit margin of below 15 percent is a clear sign
of ongoing pricing pressure in the inverters market that will
very likely continue in 2012,” Alla Gorelova, an analyst at
Steubing AG in Frankfurt, said by phone.  SMA, which published its preliminary results in a statement
today, didn’t give a forecast for 2012 earnings or sales because
of the “numerous changes in important markets and uncertainty
caused by the current euro and financial crisis.” The company
sees “positive growth” in the U.S.,  Japan  and  India , it said.  Germany, the world’s biggest market for solar products,
installed a record 3,000 megawatts of solar panels in December
as developers rushed to complete systems before a subsidy cut.
That brings German capacity installed last year to 7,500
megawatts, helping SMA achieve “the second-best earnings in the
company’s history,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
