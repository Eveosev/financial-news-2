Hungarian  inflation  unexpectedly
slowed in December on fuel costs and pre-Christmas price cuts on
food items.  Consumer prices advanced 4.1 percent from a year earlier
after a 4.3 percent increase in November, the statistics office
in Budapest said today. The median estimate of 11 analysts
surveyed was 4.3 percent. Prices rose 0.2 percent from November.  The central bank raised its  benchmark interest rate  last
month by a half-point to 7 percent, the European Union’s
highest, and policy makers said they were ready for further
increases if warranted by the outlook for inflation and risk
perception. The forint weakened after the EU and the
 International Monetary Fund  suspended aid talks.  “Fuel prices were more favorable in December than a year
ago just as food prices, which benefited from pre-Christmas
sales,” statistician Borbala Minary told reporters today.  Fuel prices in December rose 6.8 percent from a year
earlier, compared with 8.6 percent in November. Food prices rose
4.6 percent, compared with 5.1 percent.  Core inflation , which strips out volatile food and energy
prices, rose 3.3 percent in December from a year ago, compared
with 3.1 percent in November. The inflation rate averaged 3.9
percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
