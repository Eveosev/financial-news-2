Aluminum Corporation of China Ltd.’s
$300 million loan received a $30 million commitment from Hong
Kong-based Dah Sing Bank Ltd., according to a person familiar
with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the
details are private.  Australia  & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. has been
marketing the loan to banks after funding the majority of the
facility, two people familiar with the matter said on Dec. 15.  Mandated arrangers Natixis SA and ANZ Bank had originally
agreed to jointly and equally underwrite the borrowing by
Chalco, as the alumina producer is known, the people said.  The loan was signed in November with Natixis committing $50
million. Bank of America Corp. joined with a $50 million pledge
while ANZ lent $50 million, according to the people.  ANZ also provided $150 million of bridge lending, or short-
term funding which is usually replaced by longer-term financing,
the people said. Dah Sing’s pledge replaces part of that loan
from ANZ, which is looking to get three-year commitments for the
entire $150 million, the person said today.  Bank of Communications Co. and  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia  both lent $50 million in place of the bridge loan, and
China Merchants Bank Co. committed $10 million, one of the
people said on Dec. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
