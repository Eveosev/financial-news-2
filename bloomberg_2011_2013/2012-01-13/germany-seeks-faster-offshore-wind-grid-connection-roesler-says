The German government wants to
connect offshore wind farms to the power grid faster after
utilities including  RWE AG (RWE)  complained that the process was
taking too long.  Germany’s environment and economy ministries helped set up
a group that will also include regulators and industry officials
to discuss issues delaying offshore wind expansion and solve
them, Economy Minister Philip Roesler said today.  “We need offshore  wind energy  if we want to successfully
transform the German energy mix and for that, we need to connect
large offshore wind farms as quickly as possible,” Roesler said
in Berlin after meeting energy representatives.  Germany,  Europe ’s biggest economy, plans to install 10,000
megawatts of sea-based  wind turbines  this decade as it raises
the share of renewables in its energy mix. That will help make
up for the loss of nuclear energy as the country shuts down
reactors following last year’s Fukushima disaster in  Japan .  Grid operator TenneT TSO GmbH told  RWE AG (RWE) , Germany’s
second-largest utility, that hooking the utility’s 1 billion-
euro ($1.3 billion) Nordsee Ost wind farm to the grid will take
at least 12 months longer than expected. RWE wants to be
reimbursed for losses linked to the delays, which it blamed
mainly on the supply of power cables and transformer stations.  The working group will discuss regulation and liability
issues and try to find first solutions within a few months,
Roesler said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
