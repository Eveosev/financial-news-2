Turkish prosecutors halted
restoration work on historic structures in the southeastern city
of Diyarbakir and took over the site after the discovery of the
bones of six people, state news agency Anatolia reported.  The remains have been sent for forensic examination and
restoration by the local museums directorate has been halted,
the agency said. DNA samples from the remains will be used to
see if there are matches to relatives of people who have been
reported as missing, it said.  The site was formerly an interrogation center for a branch
of the intelligence services, Anatolia said on Jan. 11, citing
Raci Bilici of the local office of the Human Rights Association.  Human rights organizations say scores of people went
missing in the southeast, and accuse the government of extra-
judicial killings. Security forces are fighting the Kurdistan
Workersâ€™ Party, or PKK, in a two-decade conflict in the region
that has killed more than 40,000 people.  Turkey , the U.S. and
the European Union classify the PKK as a terrorist group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
