Peru’s sol fell the most in two
weeks as reports of “imminent” downgrades in Europe by
 Standard & Poor’s  cut demand for higher-yielding, emerging
market assets.  The sol weakened 0.1 percent to 2.6940 per U.S. dollar at
10:43 p.m. Lima time, from 2.6920 yesterday, according to
Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. The currency is unchanged this
week.  European and U.S. stocks dropped and the euro weakened
after Dow Jones Newswires cited European Union sources saying
some of the region’s nations may face downgrades as soon as
today. France will lose its AAA credit rating from Standard &
Poor’s,  Agence France-Presse  reported, citing an unidentified
government official. Copper, the Andean country’s top export,
fell after a report of increased stockpiles in China.  “Investors fear the worst in the face of what sounds like
imminent downgrades in  Europe ,” said Gonzalo Navarro, the head
trader at  Banco Santander  in Lima. The sol will probably recover
as exporters buy the currency to pay local profit taxes, he
said.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 5.75 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. The bond’s price fell 0.17 centimo to 113.96
centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
