Societe Generale SA (GLE) , which is
planning 880 corporate- and investment-banking job cuts in
 France  as the sovereign-debt crisis dents revenue, aims to
reduce 189 markets-related positions in its home country,
according to an internal memo.  Societe Generale, France’s second-largest bank, seeks to
eliminate 24 fixed-income and currencies jobs in France, while
it would also “suppress” 15 proprietary-trading positions and
20 commodities posts, according to the 245-page memo the Paris-
based company gave to union representatives last week and
obtained by Bloomberg News. Contents of the document were
reported by the French press earlier this week.  Antoine Lheritier, a Societe Generale Paris-based
spokesman, declined to comment when reached by telephone.  The lender is also planning 38 French job reductions at its
Lyxor Asset Management division, while cutting 24 positions, or
16 percent, at the corporate and  investment banking ’s anti-fraud
department SAFE, according to the memo.  Societe Generale announced on Jan. 4 plans for 880
voluntary corporate- and investment-banking job cuts in France,
or more than 10 percent of the unit’s staff in the country. The
company is eliminating jobs as banks prepare for regulations on
minimum capital levels and the sovereign-debt crisis persists,
threatening revenue from trading and investment banking.  To contact the reporter on this story:
