Falkland Oil & Gas Ltd ., an explorer
in the South Atlantic, declined after raising 48.5 million
pounds ($74 million) in a share sale.  The stock fell 11 percent to 45 pence as of the 4:30 p.m.
close in London. The company said today it sold 112,764,675 new
shares at 43 pence each to expand its drilling program.  The company plans to start its drilling in four months on
the southern side of the U.K. territory that  Margaret Thatcher 
went to war to defend from  Argentina  in 1982. The new funds will
allow the company to target additional reservoirs that may
contain more than half of Loligo’s 4.7 billion-barrel resource
potential.  “We are delighted by this show of support from new and
existing shareholders,” Chief Executive Officer Tim Bushell
said in a statement. “The additional funds will significantly
increase our flexibility over the forthcoming drilling program
expected to start in early May with the drilling of Loligo.”  Falkland Oil & Gas continues to seek partners for investing
in the project to secure additional drilling funds. The company
said it decided to sell additional shares because a deal was
unlikely to be completed before the campaign started.  “The great thing about the fundraising is that it means we
don’t have to bring in a partner before drilling starts,”
Bushell later said in a telephone interview.  Oriel Securities Ltd. and Jefferies International Ltd. are
joint bookrunners in the share sale. The placing hasn’t been
underwritten.  To contact the reporter on this story:
