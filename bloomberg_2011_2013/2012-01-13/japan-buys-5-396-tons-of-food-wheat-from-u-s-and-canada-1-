Japan  bought 5,396 metric tons of
food wheat from the U.S. and Canada today through a tender
system introduced to loosen government grain-import controls,
the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said.  Of the total wheat, 5,360 tons were from Canada, the
ministry said in a statement. It also purchased 546 tons of food
barley from the U.S., it said.  The tender was held under the so-called simultaneous buy-
and-sell system, in which food makers and trading companies
jointly bid for grains of any origin and quality.  To contact the reporter on this story:
