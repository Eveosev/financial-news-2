A Norwegian judge ordered a new
psychiatric evaluation of mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik
after criticism of a November report that found him insane and
unfit for prison.  The importance of the case requires a thorough evaluation,
Oslo District Court Judge Wenche Elizabeth Arntzen said today at
hearing. She cited among other things that prison officials have
not seen signs of mental illness as well as widespread criticism
of the initial evaluation.  Breivik on July 22 killed 77 people in a car-bomb attack on
Oslo government ministries and a shooting spree at a  Labor Party 
Youth camp. An evaluation released in November concluded that he
suffers from paranoid schizophrenia, meaning the 32-year-old
would face compulsory psychiatric treatment, potentially for
life. He faces a trial in April to establish guilt.  Breivik has admitted to the July bombing and killings at
the Utoeya island. He has said that he sought to inflict the
“greatest possible loss” to the ruling Labor Party and railed
in a manifesto posted on the Internet against “cultural
Marxism” and “Islamization.”  The November evaluation was also approved by Norway’s Board
of Forensic Medicine in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
