Safaricom Ltd. (SAFCOM) ,  Kenya ’s biggest
mobile-phone operator, rose to a 3 1/2-month high as investors
from abroad added to their holdings following the company’s
customer gains last year.  Safaricom jumped as much as 3.2 percent to 3.25 shillings
as of 1:33 p.m. in Nairobi, the highest level since Sept. 23,
based on closing prices. The stock, which reached a 12-month low
of 2.75 shillings on Dec. 8, has either  gained  or been unchanged
every day this year.  “At the current prices, we have been seeing increasing
levels of demand following price weaknesses that allows fund
managers and foreign investors to accumulate,” Gregory Waweru,
a research analyst at Nairobi-based Kestrel Capital East Africa
Ltd. said in a phone interview today.  Mobile-phone subscriber numbers in Kenya increased 4.8
percent to 25.3 million customers in the quarter ended
September, the east African country’s  industry regulator  said on
Jan. 6. Growth was led by Safaricom, which is 40 percent owned
by  Vodafone Plc (VOD) , with 593,177 new subscribers, followed by
Airtel Networks Kenya Ltd., controlled by Delhi-based  Bharti
Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , with 557,567 new subscriptions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
