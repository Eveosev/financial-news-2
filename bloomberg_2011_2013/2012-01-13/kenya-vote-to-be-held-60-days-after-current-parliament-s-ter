Kenya ’s  High Court  said the next
presidential elections in East Africa’s biggest economy should
take place within 60 days from expiry of the current parliament
or the dissolution of the country’s coalition government.  The Kenyan parliament’s current term ends in mid-January
2013, Judge Isaac Lenaola said today in the capital, Nairobi.  Petitioners including Kenyan lawmaker John Harun Mwau and
Milton Mugambi Imanyara, a lawyer, requested a ruling on the
date after the Cabinet proposed in September that elections be
held on the third Monday of December every fifth year. Kenya’s
17-month-old constitution stipulates that the vote be held on
the second Tuesday of August.  Ethnic clashes erupted after Kenya’s last election in
December 2007 when the result was disputed by supporters of
incumbent President Mwai Kibaki, and his main rival  Raila Odinga , the current prime minister. The new constitution was
promised in a power-sharing accord reached in February 2008 that
ended two months of violence in which an estimated 1,500 people
died and another 300,000 were forced to flee their homes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
