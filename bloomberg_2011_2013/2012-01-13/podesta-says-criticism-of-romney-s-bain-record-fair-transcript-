John Podesta , a former Democratic
White House chief of staff, said in an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s “Political Capital with  Al Hunt ,” airing this
weekend, that criticism leveled at Mitt Romney by Republican
presidential rivals over his private-equity record at Bain
Capital LLC is fair and will haunt him in the November election.
Podesta is now chairman of the Center for American Progress, a
Washington research group with close ties to the White House.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot

for American Progress and a former White House chief of staff,
John Podesta. Thank you for being with us.  JOHN PODESTA: Great to be with you.  HUNT: Let me talk presidential politics for just a minute,
because you can talk about almost anything, but  Newt Gingrich  -
you one time said you thought he would be the most - the chief
rival to Barack Obama. Do you think he has any chance to win the
nomination?  PODESTA: Well, I thought what he would do would be the
architect of the chief argument against Barack Obama.  HUNT: It hasn’t really worked that way.  PODESTA: But - well, Newt - Newt always kind of at some
point blows up. And I guess if somebody had asked me the follow-
up question, I would have predicted that.  HUNT: He does -  PODESTA: But he’s an articulate, smart guy, and he frames
the argument as he’s doing, I think, with Romney today, framing
-  HUNT: Do you - do you think that the criticism that Newt
Gingrich and  Rick Perry  and others are leveling against  Mitt
Romney  for his role in private equity, is it fair?  PODESTA: Well, I think it’s - I think it’s fair to talk
about it. You know, I don’t think they’re putting capitalism on
trial or the free market on trial or even private equity on
trial. Private equity can build companies, and it may make
appropriate investments.  HUNT: So what’s the critique against Romney then?  PODESTA: The critique against Romney, really, is the way,
under his leadership, Bain Capital operated, in the fact that so
many companies went bankrupt under his tenure. I think 22
percent of the investments went bankrupt. They put a lot of
people out of work, shipped a lot of jobs overseas, took a lot
of federal money and then - and then saw those companies go
belly-up.  HUNT: And you would expect -  PODESTA: So I think that’s - that’s a fair - it’s at least
fair to kind of review his record, and I think that Romney
hasn’t handled it very well by suggesting that a review of how
he personally operated at  Bain Capital  or how Bain Capital
operated under his leadership, you know, is an attack on the
whole free enterprise system. I don’t think it is.  HUNT: We’ll hear a lot about that this fall, would you
expect?  PODESTA: I think so. You know, I think that the other thing
that’s come up this week - Sarah Palin weighed in on it - is the
issue of Romney releasing his tax returns. He called on Senator
Kennedy when he ran against him to release his tax records. Now
turnabout’s a little fair play.  HUNT: Assess his strengths and weaknesses as a general
election candidate, Mitt Romney.  PODESTA: Well, I think his - you know, his basic strength
is that he kind of comes into it with an argument that “I can
just do better.” You know, that he doesn’t - the - this moment,
where the personal baggage around the way he conducted himself
at Bain is there, but, you know, he’ll try to argue that I’m
just a guy who can kind of level things out, be a calm person,
operate in the middle, and - and try to put the economy back on
track.  And, you know, I think left undusted up, if you will, by
both his Republican opponents and certainly by what the
president’s doing, you know, that’s - that has some appeal, I
think, to - certainly to Republicans and maybe to some people in
the middle.  But I think - now I think the issues are joined - the
president gave that speech in  Kansas , in Osawatomie, Kansas,
about playing fair or playing by the rules, getting the middle
class growing again. And I think Romney, if you look not just at
his record, but at what he’s proposing, when you get deep into a
plan - nobody has gone through those 59 points - you’ll see
that, really, it’s more of more tax cuts for the wealthy -  HUNT: And that’ll be the central issue, the economy and
that question of fairness?  PODESTA: I think it’s going to be the economy, yeah, and
that question of fairness and playing by the rules and who’s
going to benefit the middle class. And I think Obama bests him
in that.  HUNT: Let’s talk about the White House for a minute. You
worked in the Clinton White House. You know all these people
very well. Was outgoing White House chief of staff Bill Daley
treated fairly?  PODESTA: Well, I think he was treated fairly. Look, it’s a
rough job in there. And I think he was brought in to try to calm
things down, to - at a moment where I think that his skill set
was - the president thought could lead to the ability to do more
business, if you will, with the Republican leadership. But that
was not to be. I don’t think that’s really Bill’s fault. I think
he’s taking the spear for it, but I don’t really think it’s his
fault.  HUNT: Was he undercut by the White House, though, from the
beginning?  PODESTA: I don’t - you know, I would say he was undercut by
not having a partner on the Republican side in the House or the
Senate, by  John Boehner  or  Mitch McConnell . These guys were just
in no way interested in trying to come to the center and create
a compromise with the president.  And after that, I think that, you know, Bill was in a
position where I think he was feeling like he was a little bit
off to the side. I think he made the right call in leaving, and
I think Jack Lew is a really great choice to replace him.  HUNT: Tell me about Jack Lew, because he worked for you
when he was the head of the OMB.  PODESTA: He was the head - head of OMB when I was the -  HUNT: OMB when you were White House chief of staff.  PODESTA: Chief of staff. We had the pleasure of working
with President Clinton when we had -  HUNT: What would he bring to this job?  PODESTA: Well, he - look, he’s got very, very deep
Washington experience. He’s been around for a very long time. He
was the top aide to Tip O’Neill. He served President Clinton in
a number of roles, including OMB director. He served at the
State Department under Secretary Clinton, then at OMB. He is
just a tough, great negotiator. He knows the budget inside and
out. He’ll be able to run the - the policy side of the - of the
White House, run the budget side, be able to talk to Republicans
and Democrats on  Capitol Hill  -  HUNT: But, John, there is no real legislative agenda this
year. It’s all about the political campaign, isn’t it?  PODESTA: I don’t think - I don’t think there’s going to be
big bills passed, but, look, I think the president’s put forward
just last week a major effort to try to create a new strategy on
defense. That’s going to require some deft management, in terms
of negotiating with people on Capitol Hill to make sure that
that - that the - that what the president’s vision is and what
Secretary Panetta’s vision is for a streamlined and more
effective Pentagon is also shared on Capitol Hill. That’s
(inaudible) a lot of work.  HUNT: But wouldn’t you agree that, other than that -  PODESTA: - from Leon Panetta’s job, but Jack will be very
effective -  HUNT: But other than national security and foreign affairs,
this is really all about re-election this year, isn’t it? That’s
really what this White House -  PODESTA: No, I think - I - I disagree with that, Al. I
think that, again, Jack’s experience at OMB in particular leads
him to have great strength in doing what the president can do
under the Constitution and laws of the  United States . The
president has been doing it the last several weeks, going out,
trying to create initiatives under the current laws to try to
bring people together.  HUNT: How about the government reorganization that they
proposed the other day? Does that mean anything, or is that just
shifting boxes -  PODESTA: No, no, I think it’s - I think the - if you look
around the world, governments all over the world have
reorganized themselves to make their governments more effective,
more streamlined, but with the goal of making their economies
more competitive and more effective.  HUNT: And does this make sense, what they’re doing, more
effective?  PODESTA: Absolutely. It’s - he’s going to - going to both
streamline the government, reduce the number of boxes, if you
will. Ultimately, it’ll result in a reduction of the federal
workforce, but most importantly, it’ll create a strategy to
concentrate on what’s important to create the - to make sure
that the United States economy is - is competitive, to make sure
that manufacturing is supported and strengthened, to make sure
that small businesses have a chance to succeed in this country.  And I think the federal government has a very important
role in creating an infrastructure where competitiveness is a
focus, and that’ll help the private-sector economy, where jobs
are going to be created.  HUNT: John, who’s going to win the November election and by
how much?  PODESTA: I think  Barack Obama  will win a three-party race,
with someone on the Americans Elect ticket, and he’ll probably
win going away, because I think that third party will siphon off
-  HUNT: What type of people would be in the American Elect?
And what are we looking for, someone from the right, someone
from the Libertarians?  PODESTA: I’ll pick  Alan Simpson .  HUNT: Alan Simpson? All right. You don’t really mean that,
do you?  PODESTA: Yes, I do.  HUNT: Do you really? Okay, John Podesta, thank you very
much for being with us.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
