Metabolix Inc. (MBLX) , the Massachusetts
maker of plant-derived chemicals, had its biggest intraday
decline after  Archer Daniels Midland Co. (ADM)  unexpectedly ended a
joint venture that made bio-plastics.  Metabolix, based in Cambridge, dropped 55 percent to $2.68
at 9:33 a.m. in  New York , the largest fall since the company
began trading in 2006.  The companies’ alliance will end Feb. 8 because its
financial returns are “too uncertain,” Decatur, Illinois-based
ADM said in a statement yesterday. The company will dissolve
Telles LLC, created with Metabolix to sell the bio-plastic
Mirel, while retaining an ADM factory in Clinton, Iowa, where
the corn-based resin was made.  Metabolix didn’t expect the cancellation and will start
evaluating options for commercializing its bio-plastics
technology, including searching for a new partner, Chief
Executive OfficerRichard Eno said yesterday in a conference
call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
