JPMorgan Chase & Co. , the largest
 U.S. bank  by assets, sold $3 billion of bonds in its biggest
debt sale in almost a year as relative yields on bank debt fall
to an eight-week low.  JPMorgan, which said today fourth-quarter profit fell 23
percent amid declines in trading revenue and investment-banking
fees, sold 4.5 percent, 10-year notes, according to data
compiled by  Bloomberg. (JPM)  The New York-based bank’s securities
yield 270 basis points, or 2.7 percentage points, above similar-
maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data show.  JPMorgan, which sold almost $24 billion of bonds last year,
got the lowest  interest rate  since 2005 on a sale of 30-year
bonds by a bank in December, Bloomberg data show. The extra
yield investors demand to own U.S. dollar-denominated bank debt
instead of Treasuries fell to 364 basis points yesterday, the
lowest since Nov. 18, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data. That compares with average spreads of 260 basis
points on JPMorgan’s debt.  “This is a hard name not to like from a credit
perspective, especially considering similarly rated names such
as Wells Fargo” trade almost 100 basis points within JPMorgan
debt, Morningstar Inc. analyst James Leonard wrote in a note
today. “Assuming investors can still buy the JPM name and are
not filled up because of diversification constraints, this new
deal is very attractive,” he wrote, using the company’s ticker
symbol.  Previous Sale  The offering was the bank’s biggest sale since February
2011, when it issued $3 billion of five-year notes, Bloomberg
data show. It’s JPMorgan’s biggest issue of 10-year notes in the
U.S. since April 2009, the data show.  JPMorgan last sold 10-year notes in October, issuing $1.75
billion of 4.35 percent securities in an add-on to a $1.25
billion offering of the debt in August, Bloomberg data show. The
securities priced at a 225 basis-point spread, Bloomberg data
show.  Rival  Wells Fargo & Co ., based in  San Francisco , last sold
10-year notes in March, issuing $2.5 billion of 4.6 percent, 10-
year senior unsecured notes at a 130 basis-point spread,
Bloomberg data show.  JPMorgan said today that  net income  dropped to $3.73
billion, or 90 cents a share, from $4.83 billion, or $1.12, in
the similar period a year earlier, according to a statement.
Earnings matched the average estimate of 28 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Investment-Banking Results  Revenue in every investment-banking business fell from a
year earlier, including an 18 percent drop in trading. The
division’s total revenue fell 30 percent to $4.36 billion as
corporate clients stayed on the sidelines on concern  Europe ’s
debt crisis would lead to an economic slowdown.  The drop was larger than Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon  forecast in December, when he said investment-banking
revenue would be “essentially flat” from the third quarter’s
$6.37 billion.  Despite the drop in profit, the company’s Tier 1 common
ratio using Basel III calculations is estimated at 7.9 percent
from 7 percent last year, Morningstar’s Leonard wrote in the
note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
