PT Kharisma Pemasaran Bersama
Nusantara, which sells palm oil from  Indonesia ’s state
plantations, withdrew the 10,500 tons it offered at an auction
in Jakarta today.  The company received the highest bids from PT Hidreen Palm
International at 8,560 rupiah a kilogram from Dumai port and
from PT Victorindo Alam Lestari at 8,547 rupiah a kilogram from
Belawan port, both on Sumatra, the company said in a faxed
statement. That’s less than the target price of 8,601 rupiah a
kilogram.  Indonesia is the world’s largest producer of palm oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
