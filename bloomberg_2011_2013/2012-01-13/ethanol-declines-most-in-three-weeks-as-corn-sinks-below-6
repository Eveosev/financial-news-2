Ethanol fell to the lowest level in
more than three weeks as corn sank below $6 a bushel amid ample
supply of the biofuel.  Futures dropped for a second day after the Agriculture
Department said corn  inventories  on Dec. 1 were 9.642 billion
bushels, compared with 9.439 billion forecast by analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Ethanol output for the week ended
Jan. 6 was 944,000 barrels a day, 6.3 percent higher than a year
earlier, according to the Energy Department.  “It continues to come off with corn,” said Ian Jackson, a
trader at SCB & Associates LLC in  Chicago . “It’s the main
ingredient in making ethanol and as the input falls people
aren’t going to pay as much.”  Denatured ethanol for February delivery fell 3.3 cents, or
1.5 percent, to $2.121 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the lowest level since Dec. 19. Futures have slipped 9.7 percent
in the past year.  Stockpiles (DOESFETH)  rose to 18.8 million barrels last week, the most
since July 29, the Energy Department said Jan. 11.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast dropped 7
cents, or 3.1 percent, to $2.205 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive decreased 3 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $2.12, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  lost 3 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $2.215
a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel slipped 2.5 cents, or
1.1 percent, to $2.225.  Corn for March delivery dropped 12 cents, or 2 percent, to
$5.995 a bushel in Chicago, the first time it’s fallen below $6
since Dec. 16. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of
ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
