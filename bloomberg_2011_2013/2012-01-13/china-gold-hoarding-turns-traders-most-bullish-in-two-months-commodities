Gold traders are the most bullish in
two months after mainland  China  imported the most metal ever
from Hong Kong and investors bought U.S. bullion coins at the
fastest pace in more than two years.  Eighteen of 23 surveyed by Bloomberg expect the metal to
gain next week, the highest proportion since Nov. 11. Mainland
China imported almost 102.8 metric tons in November, valued at
about $5.4 billion, trade data on Jan. 11 showed. The  U.S. Mint 
said it sold 85,500 ounces of American Eagle gold coins in the
first 12 days of January. Full-month sales would reach 213,750
ounces at that pace, the most since December 2009.  Bullion rallied 6.2 percent since plunging to within 1
percentage point of a  bear market  on Dec. 29, on mounting
concern that economic growth is slowing and European leaders are
failing to contain the region’s debt crisis.  Holdings (.GLDTONS)  in
exchange-traded products backed by the metal are heading for the
biggest weekly expansion since mid-November and are within 2
percent of an all-time high, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The thing that’s caught people’s minds is the massive
increase in Chinese buying,” said  Ross Norman , chief executive
officer of Sharps Pixley Ltd., a brokerage handling physical
bullion in London. “Gold has demonstrated time and time again
its ability to hold purchasing power. It looks expensive and
people talk about bubbles, but it’s not.”  World Index  Bullion rose 10 percent last year on the Comex in  New York ,
beating the 1.2 percent drop in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Total
Return Index of 24 commodities and the 9.4 percent decline in
the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities. Treasuries
returned 9.8 percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.  The metal fell almost 19 percent from its record closing
price of $1,891.90 an ounce on Aug. 22 through Dec. 29, taking
it below its 200-day moving average for the first time since
January 2009. Prices closed above the moving average on Jan. 10
and settled at $1,630.80 in New York today.  Holdings in bullion-backed ETPs reached 2,357.3 tons
yesterday, valued at $124.1 billion and exceeding the reserves
of all but four central banks.  China overtook  India  in the third quarter as the largest
gold-jewelry market, according to the World Gold Council. The
gain in imports from  Hong Kong  may be a sign the central bank is
adding to reserves, according to Sharps Pixley’s Norman. The
People’s Bank of China last made known its gold  reserves  of
1,054 tons more than two years ago.  Call Options   There were 8,002 call options traded on Jan. 11 giving
holders the right to buy the metal at $2,200 by July, and the
six most widely held holdings are for calls at 22 percent above
prices today, Comex data show. Options traders are making fewer
bearish bets against the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest gold-
backed ETP, than at any time in the past 20 months.  Gold is also benefiting from concern the  euro zone  will
tumble back into recession.  Germany , the region’s biggest
economy, shrank “roughly” 0.25 percent in the fourth quarter
from the third, the Federal Statistics Office said Jan. 11. The
euro region will contract 0.2 percent this year, compared with
growth of 1.6 percent in 2011, the median of 21 economist
estimates compiled by Bloomberg show.  The rebound in gold is being threatened by a strengthening
dollar, which rose to a 15-month high against six major
currencies this week. The 30-week correlation coefficient
between the greenback and bullion is now at -0.43, data compiled
by Bloomberg show, with a figure of -1 meaning the two always
move in opposite directions.  Housing Stagnant  Global equities climbed today to the highest level since
mid-November, and the U.S. Federal Reserve said Jan. 11 that the
economy improved last month across most of the country even as
hiring was limited and housing remained stagnant.  “Gold was held back toward the end of last year because of
dollar strength and people having more confidence in the  U.S.
economy ,” said Carole Ferguson, an analyst at Fairfax IS in
 London . “If people feel the U.S. economy will pull the whole
world up a little bit, then you could see gold being very flat
to trading down.”  Hedge funds  and other money managers have become less
bullish, cutting bets on higher prices by 56 percent since the
beginning of August. They reduced their net-long position to
110,594 futures and options in the week ended Jan. 3, the lowest
since January 2009, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
data show. The last time the position was that low, prices
climbed about 17 percent in the next four weeks.  Benchmark Contract  Ten of 22 traders and analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect
copper to fall next week and three were neutral. The metal for
delivery in three months, the London Metal Exchange’s benchmark
contract, declined 21 percent last year and gained 5.3 percent
this month to $8,000 a ton.  Raw sugar retreated 27 percent last year and settled at
23.84 cents a pound today on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, and a
2.3 percent gain this month. Six of 11 people surveyed expect
prices to gain next week.  Fourteen of 22 anticipate higher corn prices, while 15 of
24 said soybeans will advance. Corn fell 7.3 percent this month
to $5.995 a bushel after increasing 2.8 percent in 2011.
Soybeans are down 4.1 percent this month at $11.5825 a bushel
after sliding 14 percent last year.  “You have a potential disturbance factor which is the euro
crisis,” said Bayram Dincer, an analyst at LGT Capital
Management in Pfaeffikon,  Switzerland . “Investors are
optimistic that the global growth rates are still high enough to
support demand and commodity prices.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
