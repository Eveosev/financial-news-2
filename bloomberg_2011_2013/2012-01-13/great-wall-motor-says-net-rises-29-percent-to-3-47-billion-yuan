Great Wall Motor Co. (2333) , a Chinese
maker of sports utilities vehicles and  pickup trucks , said
preliminary full-year net income rose 29 percent to 3.47 billion
yuan ($550 million).  Operating income increased to 30 billion yuan in 2011 from
23 billion yuan the previous year, the Baoding, Hebei province -
based maker of the Haval brand SUV said in a Shanghai stock
exchange statement today.  China â€™s auto sales growth slowed last year, trailing the
U.S. for the first time in at least 14 years, after the
government ended stimulus measures and economic expansion showed
signs of easing, according to data released by the China
Association of Automobile Manufacturers yesterday.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
