U.S. authorities placed sanctions on
three oil trading companies, including  China â€™s Zuhai Zhenrong,
for selling refined products to Iran, the Financial Times
reported, citing the U.S. State Department.  The other two traders were Kuo Oil Pte. Of Singapore and a
U.A.E.-based company, named as FAL, the newspaper said. The
State Department said all three would be barred from receiving
U.S. export licenses, export-import funding, and loans over $1
million from U.S. financial institutions, the FT said.  Zheng Mei, a director at Zuhai Zhenrong, denied the company
had ever exported refined fuel to Iran, the newspaper added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
