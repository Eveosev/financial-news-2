Federal Reserve Governor Elizabeth Duke said she doesn’t plan to immediately leave the board in
 Washington  when her term ends this month, saying she’s focused
on the issues of community banks and housing.  Duke, 59, commented in response to audience questions after
a speech today in Santa Barbara, California. She said she’s able
to stay at the Fed until a successor is appointed.  President Barack Obama’s nominees for two seats on the Fed
Board are at risk in a fight between Senate Democrats and
Republicans. Obama last month nominated Jerome Powell, an
attorney who was a Treasury undersecretary for former President
George H.W. Bush, and Jeremy Stein, a Harvard University
economist who has advised the current administration.  The Fed’s seven-member Board of Governors has two
vacancies.  Duke, a former community-bank president, was sworn in as a
Fed governor in August 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:
