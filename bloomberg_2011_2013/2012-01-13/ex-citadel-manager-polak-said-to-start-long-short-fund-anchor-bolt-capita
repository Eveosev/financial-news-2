Robert Polak, a former portfolio
manager for Citadel LLC, is opening a long-short hedge fund
focused on industrials and energy investments, according to two
people familiar with the matter.  Polak, who managed about $3 billion while he ran the global
industrials team at Citadel from 2005 to 2010, is putting up an
undisclosed amount of his own money to start Anchor Bolt Capital
LP, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified
because the information is private. The Chicago-based fund is
scheduled to open during the first quarter.  Anchor Bolt Capital will invest in capital equipment, basic
materials, energy and transportations stocks, the person said.
The fund will typically hold 50 to 80 positions, about 15 to 20
of which will be bets on equities expected to gain. It will
target a so-called net exposure of about 10 to 30 percent, which
is calculated by subtracting the percentage of a fund’s short
positions, or bets on falling securities, from its longs.  Sean Stephens, chief financial officer at Anchor Bolt
Capital, declined to comment on details regarding the fund’s
start.  Before joining Chicago-based Citadel in 2005, Polak was an
analyst at Copper Arch Capital LLC in  New York  and NWQ
Investment Management Co. in  Los Angeles , focusing on industrial
and energy-related companies. He began his career in  investment
banking  in 1995 at  Salomon Brothers . Stephens was formerly chief
financial officer at Chicago-based Aragon Global Management LLC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
