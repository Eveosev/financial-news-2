Corn declined for a third straight
day, extending the worst slump in three months, after the U.S.
government unexpectedly increased its global supply estimate.  March-delivery corn declined as much as 1.1 percent on the
Chicago Board of Trade to $6.05 a bushel, the lowest price for a
most-active contract since Dec. 21. Futures traded at $6.0975 a
bushel at 9:32 a.m. Singapore time, after plunging 6.1 percent
yesterday, the most since Sept. 30.  Global production will exceed demand for the first time in
three years as higher harvests in the U.S., the largest grower,
 Russia , Ukraine and the European Union more than offset losses
in  Argentina , the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said yesterday.
That prompted the agency to raise its world inventory estimate.
Analysts had forecast a decline in this season’s stockpiles.  “This disappointed the bullish pre-report trade
estimates,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at
Commonwealth Bank of  Australia , said in a report today.  Inventories worldwide will rise to 128.14 million metric
tons before this year’s Northern Hemisphere harvest, from 128.06
million tons a year earlier, the USDA said. Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News had forecast the agency to cut this year’s
projection to 123.23 million tons.  In the U.S., the stockpiles may total 846 million bushels
before this year’s harvest, 12 percent more than analysts
expected, a USDA report showed. The 2011 crop totaled 12.358
billion bushels, up from 12.31 billion estimated in December,
while global output will reach a record 868.06 million tons.  Global Consumption  Global demand will rise to 867.98 million tons, smaller
than the 868.6 million tons estimated last month, the USDA said.  “Markets once again proved their inability to predict the
USDA’s moves, with consensus (ourselves included) directionally
wrong on many estimates,” Morgan Stanley analysts led by
 Hussein Allidina  said in a report yesterday.  Shares of Tyson Foods Inc., the largest U.S. meat producer,
and Sanderson Farms Inc. advanced on speculation lower grain
prices will cut costs, boosting their profitability. Tyson
gained 1.1 percent to $19.96 in  New York  while Sanderson rose
6.3 percent to $50.41, the biggest increase in five months.  Soybeans for March delivery climbed 0.8 percent to $11.9175
a bushel, after closing 1.7 percent lower yesterday. Wheat for
delivery in the same month was little changed at $6.055 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
