Oil options volatility slipped as
underlying futures fell to a three-week low on news that an
embargo on Iranian oil imports may be postponed.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
March, a measure of expected swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, was 32.3 at 3 p.m. in New York, compared with

said that the ban would be delayed for six months to allow
nations to find new supply. Members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries would be able to make up for a
drop in Iranian supplies to  Europe , former OPEC President Chakib Khelil said.  “Oil had been rising because of the escalating tension
surrounding  Iran , and now the same thing that brought oil up is
the same thing that’s bringing it down,” said  James Williams ,
an economist at WTRG Economics, an energy research firm in
 London ,  Arkansas .  The most active options contracts in electronic trading
