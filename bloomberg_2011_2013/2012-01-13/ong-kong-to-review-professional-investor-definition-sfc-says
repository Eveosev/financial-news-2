Hong Kong ’s Securities and Futures
Commission is considering changing the rules used to classify
some individual investors as “professional.”  “We will probably later this year revisit the whole
professional investor regime, including potentially the
financial limits that define what a professional investor is,”
Ashley Alder, chief executive officer of the securities
regulator, said Wednesday.  Alder was speaking at an event hosted by the Hong Kong
Corporate Counsel Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
