Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  agreed
to pay $40 million to settle a securities-fraud class action
over mortgage-backed securities.  Lehman reached the settlement after 10 months of mediation
with a group of union pension funds representing investors in 17
securities offerings, the plaintiffs said in papers filed today
requesting approval of the agreement from a federal court in
Manhattan.  The settlement, which must be approved by the court before
it can take effect, would resolve the investorsâ€™ claims that
Lehman disregarded underwriting standards for the securities,
causing them to lose money. The pension funds said they believe
there were hundreds or thousands of investors in the securities,
which were sold for about $24.3 billion.  Lehman, formerly the fourth-biggest investment bank,
collapsed in 2008. Lehman filed for  bankruptcy protection  in  New
York  listing $613 billion in debt.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Mortgage-Backed
Securities Litigation, 08-cv-6762, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
