Seattle Genetics Inc. (SGEN)  said its
Hodgkin lymphoma drug Adcetris will carry a new boxed warning,
the strictest U.S. caution, about a risk of dangerous brain
infections.  Patients taking the medicine may develop a rare,
potentially fatal condition known as progressive multifocal
leukoencephalopathy or PML, the Bothell, Washington-based
company said today in a statement. The revised label also will
warn against using Adcetris with the cancer drug bleomycin
because of risks of lung toxicity.  “Although PML in lymphoma patients can be caused by
factors such as underlying disease and prior therapies that
affect the immune system, a contributory role of Adcetris cannot
be excluded,”  Thomas Reynolds, Seattle Genetics’ chief medical
officer, said in the statement.  Seattle Genetics declined 5.2 percent to $17.49 at 1:55
p.m. New York time.  Three patients have developed PML during treatment with
Adcetris, the  Food and Drug Administration  said today in a  drug
safety  communication. Symptoms may include mood changes,
confusion,  memory loss , weakness on one side of the body, and
changes in vision, speech or walking. About 2,000 people
worldwide have received Adcetris since its approval in August,
the FDA said.  Adcetris, known chemically as brentuximab, is Seattle
Genetics’s first product. Sales of the medicine may surpass $275
million in 2014, according to the  average estimate  of three
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
