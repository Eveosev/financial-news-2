Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
President  James Bullard  said the central bank’s decision to
release projections for the path of the federal funds rate is
“no panacea,” while a step forward in transparency.  “It’s not going to be perfect” because “you still have
17 possible paths,” he said in response to audience questions
today after a speech in St. Louis, referring to the 17
projections from Fed officials. “I think it will be a little
bit helpful” and yet it is “no panacea.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
