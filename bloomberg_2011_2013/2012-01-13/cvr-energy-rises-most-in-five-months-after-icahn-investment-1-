CVR Energy Inc. (CVI) , the refining
company formerly owned by  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , rose the
most in five months after announcing that entities associated
with billionaire  Carl Icahn  invested in the company.  CVR climbed 4.5 percent to $23.24 at 11:12 a.m. in New York
after issuing a statement today about the Icahn investment. The
stock reached as high as $24.32, the biggest intraday gain since
Aug. 11 for the Sugar Land, Texas-based company.  Icahn, known for investing in distressed companies and
agitating for changes in management, couldn’t be immediately
reached for comment. Icahn Capital LP held  3.5 percent  of CVR’s
shares as of Jan. 10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  CVR has refineries in Coffeyville,  Kansas , and Wynnewood,
Oklahoma, capable of processing a combined 185,000 barrels a
day. The company also owns a majority interest in CVR Partners
LP, which produces fertilizers.  Goldman Sachs and Kelso & Co. sold shares in the company in
2008 and as part of its initial public offering in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
