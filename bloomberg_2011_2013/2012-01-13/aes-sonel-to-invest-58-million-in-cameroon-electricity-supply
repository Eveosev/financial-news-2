AES Sonel SA will invest 30 billion
 CFA francs  ($58 million) to improve the drought-affected
electricity supply in Cameroon, the general manager of the power
company said.  Three dams that are used to generate hydroelectric power in
the Central African nation, are not operating at full capacity
because of a lack of rain, Jean David Bile told reporters in
Yaounde yesterday.  “We have invested 30 billion francs to rehabilitate the
national network,” Bile said.  Several projects will be undertaken this year, including
the construction of a 225-kilovolt line between Bekoko and
Nkongsamba, 350 kilometers (219 miles) west of Yaounde, the
capital, to boost supply in the West and Northwest regions, he
said. A line will also be built in Kousserie in the Extreme
North region, he said, without giving further details.  AES Sonel, a unit of U.S.-based AES Corp., is Cameroon’s
main supplier of electricity. It estimates national demand at
more than 1,700 megawatts against an installed supply of 1,033
megawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
