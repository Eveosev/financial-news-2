Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  cleared an
obstacle against drilling off the coast of  Alaska  today as the
Environmental Protection Agencyâ€™s Environmental Appeals Board
denied a challenge by environmentalists.   The board declined the request to review emissions permits
for drilling in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas off the
North Slope of Alaska. The board announced the decision on its
website today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
