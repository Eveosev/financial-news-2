G4S Plc, the world’s largest
security company, said Alf Duch-Pedersen is retiring as chairman
of the company following the failed takeover attempt of ISS.  Duch-Pederson will retire once a successor is found, the
Crawley, England-based company said in a statement today. The
search for a new chairman is already underway, it said.  G4S and Duch-Pedersen, 65, came under pressure from
investors to reshuffle the board after the failed purchase of
the cleaning company. The 5.2 billion-pound ($8 billion)
takeover derailed following opposition from investors wary of
the size of borrowings amid  Europe ’s debt crisis.  G4S was attempting its biggest acquisition via a rights
offer and the addition of about 3.8 billion pounds in
borrowings. It advertised the purchase as a “real game
changer,” arguing that the addition of ISS would let G4S bundle
different kinds of office-upkeep and security services into a
single contract.  To contact the reporters on this story:
