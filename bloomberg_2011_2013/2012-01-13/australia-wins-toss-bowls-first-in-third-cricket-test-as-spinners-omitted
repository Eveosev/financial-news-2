Australia  reduced India to 73-4 at
lunch on day one of the third cricket Test in Perth after
sending the touring team in to bat.  Paceman Ben Hilfenhaus took two wickets and Peter Siddle
and Ryan Harris each claimed one on a WACA Ground pitch
described by Australiaâ€™s  Ricky Ponting  this week as the fastest
and bounciest in the world.  Gautam Gambhir top scored with 31 before Hilfenhaus got him
to edge behind to wicketkeeper Brad Haddin. Hilfenhaus earlier
combined with Ponting at second slip to remove  Virender Sehwag 
without scoring, while Siddle bowled Rahul Dravid for 9 and
Harris trapped Sachin Tendulkar leg-before-wicket for 15.  Australia, which leads the best-of-four contest 2-0, made
two changes to the team that won the second Test by an innings
and 68 runs, bringing in Harris and Mitchell Starc for spinner
Nathan Lyon and injured fast bowler  James Pattinson .  India, seeking to avoid its seventh straight away Test
loss, handed Vinay Kumar his debut in place of spinner
Ravichandran Ashwin as both teams opted for all-pace attacks.  Australia would regain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy contested
by the teams by avoiding defeat in either of the last two Tests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
