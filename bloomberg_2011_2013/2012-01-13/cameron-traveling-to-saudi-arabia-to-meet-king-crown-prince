David Cameron  will make his first
visit to Saudi Arabia since becoming U.K. prime minister, a trip
he postponed last year due to the death of the previous crown
prince.  Cameron will meet  King Abdullah  and Crown Prince Nayef
today to discuss regional issues and the global economy, his
office said. Saudi Arabia is the U.K.’s largest trading partner
in the region, with annual bilateral commerce worth 15 billion
pounds ($23 billion).  The U.K. sees the Saudis as a partner in the region,
Cameron’s office said, pointing to the way the two countries are
cooperating in supporting the Arab League’s efforts to end
repression in Syria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
