(Corrects headline, first paragraph to specify that a
buyer has yet to be picked.)  Rhoen-Klinikum AG (RHK)  may be the front-
runner in a bid to buy a 49 percent stake in Dr.-Horst-Schmidt-
Kliniken, in a transaction valued at more than 300 million euros
($386 million),  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported, without
saying where it got the information.  Rhoen has agreed not to fire workers at the health-care
facility, which is owned by the German city of Wiesbaden, before
the end of 2015, FAZ said.  The city departmental head Arno Gossmann and the chairmen
of the municipal councilâ€™s political parties will recommend
Rhoen as a buyer, the Frankfurt-based newspaper said. The final
decision by city official is slated for Feb. 9, according to the
report. Volker Karb, an investor relations spokesman at Rhoen-
Klinikum, declined to comment on details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
