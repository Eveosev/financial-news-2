Tungsten will probably stay above
$40,000 a metric ton this year, as China, the biggest producer,
continues to curb exports, according to  Malaga Inc. (MLG)   Ammonium paratungstate, the traded form of the metal,
increased 32 percent last year to end the year above $440 a
metric ton unit, according to European price  data  from Metal
Bulletin. A metric ton unit equals ten kilograms (22 pounds).
Tungsten, used in drill bits, industrial tools and mobile
phones, has risen more than sevenfold since 2003.  “When you look at the full year, I don’t think the average
price will be below $400,” Pierre Monet, president and chief
executive officer of Malaga, which produces tungsten in  Peru ,
said in an interview in Toronto today.  China accounts for 80 percent to 85 percent of global
tungsten production, Monet said. There’s no indication that the
government will change its policy of restricting exports to
protect domestic supply, he said.  There’s no significant new supply expected outside of  China 
for the next two to three years, Monet said. “The market is
really, really tight.”  Malaga’s Pasto Bueno operation in Peru produces about 10
percent of the global tungsten mine output outside of China,
Monet said.  The company, based in  Montreal , plans to increase
processing operations from 350 tons a day to 500 tons a day by
year-end and may double production beyond that by late 2013 to
take advantage of strong demand, Monet said.  “We produce one container a week for our customer,” he
said. “They would like to have one a day.”  Malaga was unchanged at 11 Canadian cents at the close in
Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
