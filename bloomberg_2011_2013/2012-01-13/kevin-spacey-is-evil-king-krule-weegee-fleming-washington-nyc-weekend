Kevin Spacey  takes on the villainous
Richard III, nimbly climbing over the growing stacks of bodies
to grab the crown.  Sam Mendes directs the modern-dress production of
Shakespeare’s play -- the two worked together on “American
Beauty,” which earned both an Oscar.  It’s a hair-raising journey all the way to Richard’s final
battlefield cry: “A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse!”  Through March 4 at the  Brooklyn  Academy of Music’s Harvey
Theater, 651 Fulton St., Brooklyn. Information: +1-718-636-4100;

“Weegee” loved beating the cops to a corpse.  “Naked City” has images of “Watching a Five Alarm Fire,
First Avenue at 30th Street,” cops pointing at a fallen  New
Yorker  in “Accident” and “Transvestite in a Police Van.”  Happier scenes show girls swooning over  Frank Sinatra .  Runs through Feb. 25 at Steven Kasher Gallery, 521 W. 23rd
St. Information: +1-212-966-3978;  http://www.stevenkasher.com .  Drop into Cookshop for a powerhouse Bloody Mary and some
fish tacos. Or maybe strawberry and angel food desserts.  At 156 10th Ave. Information: +1-212-924-4440.  Saturday Matinee  Champion tenor  Roberto Alagna  is the doomed artist
Cavaradossi in the Met’s “Tosca.”  Alagna, a triumph of physical fitness and vocal glamor, has
already sung “Faust” at the Met this week, stepping in for an
afflicted colleague.  Patricia Racette is a match for the frumpy, widely loathed
production by Luc Bondy, which also features George Gagnidze as
Scarpia, the police chief. But Alagna is worth the trip.  Metropolitan Opera  at  Lincoln Center . Information: +1-212-
362-6000;  http://www.metoperafamily.org .  Saturday Night  Sunny San Francisco-based band Girls headlines Terminal 5
on Saturday with support from New Jersey surf-rock act Real
Estate.  Lead singer Christopher Owens crafts savvy pop gems that
add devastating lyrics to toe-tapping catchiness. His personal
story figures in his musical style -- he grew up in and then
escaped from the Church of God cult.  Now he’s seeking simple pleasures: wine and pizza, parties
on the beach.  The opener is heavily buzzed-about British singer King
Krule, formerly known as Zoo Kid.  At 610 W. 56th St. Information: +1-212-582-6600;

100,000. Most people lived south of Canal Street, while to the
north pigs and goats roamed through farmland.  Then, in 1811, planners came up with the idea of the grid,
which stretched from Houston Street to 155th Street and brought
order and dullness to  New York ’s streetscape.  To celebrate its 200 years, the Museum of the City of New
York has assembled historical maps, photographs and prints
showing  Manhattan ’s evolution. See if you can spot your house.  “The Greatest Grid” runs through April 15 at 1220 Fifth
Ave. Information: +1-212-534-1672;  http://www.mcny.org .  Sunday Matinee  Renee Fleming sings Mahler’s “Ruckert-Lieder” in a
program also featuring arias from Samuel Barber’s “Antony and
Cleopatra” and “Vanessa,” as well as Bernard Herrmann
“Wuthering Heights.”  Fabio Luisi conducts the Metropolitan Opera orchestra.  Also on the program are clarinet concertos by Mozart and
Copland.  Carnegie Hall , 57th St. and 7th Ave. Information: +1-212-
247-7800;  http://www.carnegiehall.org .  Monday  Spend the day at the  Metropolitan Museum ’s just-opened New
American Wing Galleries whose 17,000 works range from colonial
furniture to sculpture by Saint-Gaudens.  Pride of place is given to Leutze’s monumental “Washington
Crossing the  Delaware ” (1851), restored and reframed. You can
practically feel that winter wind on the general’s face.  The final phase of a major renovation project, the
galleries have touch-screen case labels and computer access for
gathering additional information.  The  Metropolitan Museum of Art , 1000 Fifth Ave. at 82nd
Street. Information: +1-212-535-7710;  http://www.metmuseum.org .  (Zinta Lundborg is an editor for Muse, the arts and leisure
