Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) ’s bidding
war with another buyer drove up the price the drugmaker paid for
 Inhibitex Inc. (INHX)  and its hepatitis C treatment about 30 percent,
according to a filing.  Bristol-Myers began its courtship last October seeking to
purchase Alpharetta, Georgia-based Inhibitex’s experimental drug
for $550 million, according to a filing today with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. On Jan. 3, the deal had
become an offer of $20 a share for the company, which Bristol-
Myers raised twice until Jan. 7 when the New York-based
drugmaker announced an agreement to buy Inhibitex for $26 a
share, a value of about $2.5 billion.  The purchase was the second major acquisition of a company
for its hepatitis C assets in the past three months. Pharmasset
agreed to be acquired by Gilead Sciences Inc. for $10.8 billion
in a deal announced Nov. 21.  Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc. (IDIX)  and  Achillion Pharmaceuticals
Inc. (ACHN)  are also testing medicines that may enter a developing $20
billion market for hepatitis C drugs that are easier to use and
more effective than existing therapies. As many as 170 million
people worldwide carry the virus, a bloodborne disease that can
lead to liver cirrhosis and cancer, according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.  Shares of Idenix and Achillion have risen since the
Bristol-Myers deal. Idenix has more than doubled in value,
closing today at $14.42. Achillion shares have increased 56
percent during the period to $12.37.  To contact the reporter on this story:
