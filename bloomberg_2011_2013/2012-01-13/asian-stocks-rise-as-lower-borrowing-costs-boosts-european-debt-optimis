Asian  stocks  rose, with a regional
benchmark index poised for its longest streak of weekly advances
in a year, as lower Italian and Spanish borrowing costs added to
optimism  Europe ’s debt crisis may be contained.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that gets a third of its sales
in Europe, climbed 3.1 percent in Tokyo.  JGC Corp. (1963) ,  Japan ’s
biggest builder of factories by sales, jumped 3.9 percent after
winning a $15 billion project to build a liquefied natural gas
facility in Australia. Suzlon Energy Ltd., a maker of  wind
turbines , climbed 9.9 percent in Mumbai after its unit was
contracted to develop a power plant in the U.S.  Once concern about Europe’s debt crisis is “lifted at
least in the short-term, we should see some good performance in
Asian equity markets,” said Diane Lin, a  fund manager  with
Sydney-based fund Pengana Capital Ltd., which manages about $1.1
billion in global assets. ECB policy makers “have stabilized
the whole situation. There’s a lot of bonds to be issued by
European governments in the short-term. It is important for them
to be able to refinance.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.9 percent to 117.23 as
of 7:05 p.m. in  Tokyo , poised for its highest close since Dec. 8.
Almost two shares rose for each that fell. The gauge is heading
for its fourth weekly advance, the longest streak since last
January, amid bets Europe will manage its debt and  China  will
ease lending curbs in the world’s second-biggest economy.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  advanced 1.4 percent,
while South Korea’s Kospi Index gained 0.6 percent. Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index added 0.4 percent.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index
rose 0.6 percent. China’s Shanghai Composite Index declined 1.3
percent.  Taiwan Elections  Taiwan’s Taiex was little changed ahead of tomorrow’s
presidential elections. President Ma Ying-jeou, who heads the
Kuomintang Party, has been widening his lead over the  Democratic
Progressive Party ’s Tsai Ing-wen in opinion polls.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent
today. The measure added 0.2 percent in New York yesterday after
ECB President  Mario Draghi  pointed to signs of economic
stabilization after the central bank provided three-year loans
to lenders totaling a record 489 billion euros ($628 billion)
last month to maintain liquidity.  Exporters to Europe advanced after Spanish two-year yields
fell to the lowest since March as the nation raised 9.98 billion
euros ($12.8 billion) from a note auction, twice the target.
Italy’s two-year yields fell to the lowest since September.  ‘Reasonably Successful’  Canon gained 3.1 percent to 3,355 yen in Tokyo. Mazda Motor

Europe, rose 1.6 percent to 130 yen.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , the
Hong Kong-based clothier that counts Europe as its biggest
market, climbed 4.1 percent to HK$11.68.  “The ECB’s long-term refinancing operations looks
reasonably successful with regard to the Spanish and Italian
bond auctions,” Lim Say Boon, chief investment officer at DBS
Private Bank, said on Bloomberg Television. “That’s keeping the
appetite for risk up for the time being.”  JGC and  Chiyoda Corp. (6366)  rallied after their group was awarded
a $15 billion contract to help build  Inpex Corp. (1605) ’s Ichthys LNG
project. JGC climbed 3.9 percent to 1,975 yen, while Chiyoda
advanced 3.1 percent to 824 yen.  Inpex, Japan’s biggest energy explorer, and partner Total

percent to 516,000 yen.  Indian Stocks  The BSE India Sensitive Index climbed 0.7 percent. Suzlon

150-megawatt power project in Oklahoma.  Coal India Ltd., the country’s top producer of the fuel,
rose 5 percent to 342 rupees after saying it’s close to reaching
a wage agreement with unions.  Pacific Metals Co. (5541)  climbed 4.5 percent to 375 yen in Tokyo
after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the stainless-steel supplier
and Bridgestone Corp. will be among the top Japanese stocks this
year, Bridgestone, the world’s biggest tire maker by sales, rose
1.4 percent to 1,733 yen.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 2 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with the  S&P 500 ’s 3 percent rise
and a 2 percent climb for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Shares in
the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.2 times  estimated earnings 
on average, compared with 12.3 times for the S&P 500 and 10
