A southern Russian farm had to
slaughter all 30,736 of its pigs because of African swine fever,
the country’s largest outbreak of the virus.  The pigs at the Plemzavod Industrialny farm in the southern
Russian Krasnodar region were used to supply pork to local
markets, said Alexei Alekseenko, a spokesman for the
Rosselkhoznadzor,  Russia ’s food safety agency. Veterinary
officials at the Timashevsky district were fired, he said.  A farm worker who kept his own hogs probably brought the
virus in, Alekseenko said. African swine fever was discovered in
21 of Russia’s 83 regions since 2007, according to
Rosselkhoznadzor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
