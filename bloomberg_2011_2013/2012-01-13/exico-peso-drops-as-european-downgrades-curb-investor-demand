Mexico’s peso fell the most in two
weeks after  Standard & Poor’s  downgrades of European countries
reduced demand for the Latin American country’s assets.  The peso weakened 0.5 percent to 13.5985 per  U.S. dollar  at
the close in Mexico City, from 13.5323 yesterday. It was
currency’s worst performance since Dec. 27 and pared its gain on
the week to 1 percent.  France and Austria lost their top credit ratings at S&P in
a swathe of downgrades that left  Germany  with the euro area’s
only stable AAA grade, hindering leaders’ efforts to stem the
region’s fiscal crisis.  The peso declined as “doubt and negativity rose again in
markets,” Omar Martin del Campo, head trader at Banco Ve Por
Mas SA in  Mexico  City, said in a telephone interview after S&P
announced the ratings cuts.  The yield on Mexico’s benchmark peso-denominated bond due
in 2024 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.55
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price of
the security fell 0.20 centavo today to 129.95 centavos per
peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
