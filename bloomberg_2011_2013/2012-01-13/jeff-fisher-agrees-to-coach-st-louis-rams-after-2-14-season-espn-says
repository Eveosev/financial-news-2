Jeff Fisher  says he has picked the
 St. Louis Rams  for his next head coaching position, a year after
being fired by the  Tennessee Titans .  “I’m really excited that the Rams are the best fit for
me,” Fisher told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. “I hope I’m the
best fit for the Rams, and am looking forward to finalizing the
details and coming to work.”  Dolphins owner Stephen Ross said in a statement posted on
his team’s website that Miami also had discussions with Fisher
about that club’s head coaching vacancy.  “The process has been lengthy, but for good reasons,”
Fisher told the Post-Dispatch yesterday. “I took a lot of time
looking at and exploring in detail the non-economic issues of
both clubs.”  Fisher, 53, will take over a team that finished 2-14 this
season and failed to reach the National Football League playoffs
for the seventh consecutive year. He will replace Steve Spagnuolo, who was fired this month after winning 10 games in
three years.  Fisher coached the Titans franchise from 1994 to 2010,
leading the team to six playoff berths, four division titles and
a Super Bowl appearance after the 1999 season. In 17 years as a
head coach, he is 142-120 in the regular season and 5-6 in the
playoffs.  The Rams fired Spagnuolo and General Manager Bill Devaney
after a two-win season that gained them the second pick in the
 NFL Draft  in April. The team hasn’t had a winning season since
2003.  To contact the reporter on this story:
