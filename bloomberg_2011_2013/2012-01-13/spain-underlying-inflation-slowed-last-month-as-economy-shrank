Spain ’s underlying inflation rate
slowed in December as the economy edged closer to a second
recession in two years.  Core (SPIPCCYY)  consumer prices, which exclude energy and fresh food,
gained 1.5 percent from a year earlier, slowing from 1.7 percent
in November, the National Statistics Institute in Madrid said
today. Headline inflation, based on European Union calculations,
was 2.4 percent, compared with an initial estimate of 2.3
percent on Dec. 30.  Spain’s economy is on the “edge of a recession,” Budget
Minister Cristobal Montoro said on Jan. 11 after the Bank of
Spain estimated the economy shrank in the last three months of
the year. Unemployment of 23  percent  is keeping consumers from
spending, which prompted fashion retailers including  Cortefiel 
to offer 50 percent discounts in the run-up to the holiday
season in December.  Retail  sales  dropped 7.2 percent from a year earlier in
November, the 17th straight decline. Sales have fallen every
month except two since December 2007, according to INE data.
Unemployment is the highest in the European Union and the most
since the EU’s statistics institute started  compiling  the data
in 1983.  To contact the reporter on this story:
