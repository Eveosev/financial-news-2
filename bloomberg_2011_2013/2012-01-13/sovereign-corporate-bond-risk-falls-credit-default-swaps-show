Credit-default swaps insuring
European sovereign bonds fell, heading for the biggest weekly
decline in six weeks, after Italian borrowing costs eased at a
debt auction.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments dropped two basis points to
325.5 at 11:30 a.m. in  London . The gauge is down from 382 at the
start of the week. A decline signals improvement in perceptions
of  credit quality .  Italy sold 3 billion euros of bonds maturing in November
2014 today to yield 4.83 percent, compared with 5.62 percent at
the previous auction. Spanish borrowing costs fell at a debt
sale yesterday and European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi 
said he sees signs the region’s economy is stabilizing.  “We’ve had another round of good auctions, that’s the main
driver this morning in Europe,” said Roger Francis, an analyst
at Mizuho International Plc in London. “There’s also some
positive carryover from yesterday, from Draghi’s comments.”  Credit-default swaps on  Italy  and  Spain  fell for a fifth
day. Contracts on Italy declined 7.5 basis points to 483 and are
little changed since the start of the year, according to CMA.
Spain dropped six basis points to 386, heading for the biggest
weekly decline since Dec. 2.  The cost of insuring financial and corporate debt also
fell, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. The Markit iTraxx
Financial Index linked to senior debt of 25 banks and insurers
decreased 5.5 basis points to 260.5 and the subordinated index
dropped 13 to 467.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings fell five basis
points to 711. The Markit iTraxx  Europe  Index of 125 companies
with investment-grade ratings dropped 3.5 basis points to 167.5
basis points.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($12.9 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
