Graham Emmett, head of lending at
Ireland’s National Asset Management Agency, is resigning from
the Dublin-based troubled loans administrator.   Emmett, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker, is
leaving the asset manager to return to the U.K.,  Ray Gordon , a
NAMA spokesman, said by telephone.  NAMA was set up to purge Ireland’s banks of 74.2 billion
euros ($94.1 billion) of risky commercial real-estate loans, for
which it paid 31.7 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
