Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
state controlled oil company, plans to help its suppliers raise
about 4 billion reais ($2.2 billion) this year through local
asset-backed securities, Chief Financial Officer Almir Barbassa
said.  The amount would add to the 1.1 billion reais raised since
the program began in the middle of 2011, Barbassa said in a
telephone interview.  “We’ve surpassed 1.1 billion reais and we estimate that we
can reach 5 billion by the end of this year, accumulated,”
Barbassa said. “The supply chain is very important for
Petrobras, and this program reduces costs for suppliers.”  Petrobras, with an investment-grade  credit rating , is
helping suppliers with little or no credit history borrow money
in  Brazil  at cheaper rates by using their contracts with the oil
company as backing. The effort should help the state-owned oil
company follow through on its $225 billion investment plan, the
largest in the world, while fulfilling a commitment to purchase
as much as 70 percent of its equipment from local providers.  Asset-backed funds, known in Brazil as fundos de
investimento em direitos creditorios, or FIDCs, are typically
backed by trade receivables, mortgages and other consumer or
corporate loans.  To contact the reporters on this story:
