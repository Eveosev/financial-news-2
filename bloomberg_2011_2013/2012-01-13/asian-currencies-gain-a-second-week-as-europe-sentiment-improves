Asian currencies gained for a second
week on signs European efforts to contain the debt crisis are
working, boosting sentiment for riskier emerging-market assets.  India ’s rupee rallied the most since October 2009 after
factory output beat estimates, while South  Korea ’s won completed
its best week since early December after the central bank left
its benchmark  interest rate  unchanged. The MSCI Asia-Pacific
Index of  shares  advanced as European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi  said Jan. 12 he saw “tentative signs” of
stability in the euro region.  “There is some slight bounce with much better sentiment
and stability in  Europe ,” said Roy Teo, a currency strategist
at ABN Amro Private Bank in Singapore. “U.S. data in recent
months have also been instrumental in aiding risk sentiment on
stocks and emerging-market assets.”  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar  Index (ADXY) , which tracks the
region’s 10 most-active currencies excluding the yen, advanced
0.4 percent from a week ago to 115.62.  The rupee rose 2.3 percent for the week to 51.5287 per
dollar in Mumbai, while the won closed 1.3 percent stronger at
1,148.40, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
Philippine peso climbed 0.9 percent to 43.725 and  Malaysia ’s
ringgit appreciated 0.3 percent to 3.1333.  Spain and  Italy  sold bonds this week for the first time in
2012, with borrowing costs declining as they issued a combined
22 billion euros ($28.2 billion) of debt on Jan. 12. Italy
auctioned 2014 and 2018 bonds yesterday.  U.S. Data  Confidence among U.S. consumers reached its highest level
in eight months in January, according to data released yesterday,
on signs the labor market is improving. The Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of  consumer
sentiment  climbed to 74 from 69.9 at the end of December. The
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey called for 71.5. The
measure has increased 9.9 points in the past two months, the
biggest such gain since April-May 2009.  U.S. data due on Jan. 18 may show industrial production
increased in December following a contraction the previous month,
according to a separate survey.  India’s factory output rose 5.9 percent in November from a
year earlier, beating the median forecast for a 2.1 percent gain.
Production fell 4.7 percent the previous month, the government
said. Overseas funds boosted holdings of rupee bonds by $490
million to a record $28.15 billion this week through Jan. 11.  “The move in recent days was largely because of the inflow
expectations,” said Vikas Babu, a currency trader at state-run
 Andhra Bank  in Mumbai. “Unexpectedly strong industrial output
data also supported the rupee.”  Repurchase Rate  South Korea ’s won closed at the strongest level in a month
after the  Bank of Korea  kept its seven-day repurchase rate at
 3.25 percent  yesterday, a move predicted by all 14 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The Bank of Korea showed strong commitment to stem
inflation, which heightened speculation the government will
allow currency gains to curb gains in import prices,” said Lee
Jin Ill, a Seoul-based senior currency trader with Hana Bank.  Taiwan’s dollar completed a fourth weekly advance on
speculation President Ma Ying-jeou, who has improved economic
ties with  China  since he took office in 2008, will be re-elected
in today’s election. Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of the opposition
 Democratic Progressive Party , is running against Ma of the
Kuomintang party.  The currency strengthened to NT$30.00 versus the dollar
and touched NT$29.88 on Jan. 12.  “Whoever wins, there won’t be a U-turn in policy toward
China because  Taiwan ’s economy is dependent on the mainland and
they can’t afford to be backtracking on it,” said Rees Kam, a
Hong Kong-based senior strategist at SJS Markets Ltd. “The
Taiwanese dollar is considered a low-risk currency in the
region.”  China Growth  China’s yuan rose 0.05 percent to 6.3066 per dollar from a
week ago. The government said Jan. 12 the inflation rate eased
for a fifth month to 4.1 percent in December. A report on Jan.
17 may show the world’s second-largest economy grew at an annual
rate of 8.7 percent last quarter, the least since the second
quarter of 2009, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey.  Elsewhere, Indonesia’s rupiah rose 0.1 percent to 9,082
per dollar, after three weeks of losses, and the  Thai baht 
declined 0.3 percent to 31.79, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
 Singapore ’s dollar gained 0.4 percent to S$1.2888.  To contact the reporters on this story:
