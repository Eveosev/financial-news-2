Polish  consumer-price  growth slowed
from the highest rate in six months in December as clothing and
footwear prices fell, easing pressure on policy makers to raise
 interest rates .  Prices advanced 4.6 percent from a year earlier after a 4.8
percent increase in November, the  Central Statistics Office  in
Warsaw said today. The  median estimate  of 30 economists in a
Bloomberg survey was 4.7 percent. Prices rose 0.4 percent from
the previous month, with growth over the whole of 2011 reaching
an average of 4.3 percent.  The Narodowy Bank Polski, which left its benchmark  seven-
day  rate at 4.5 percent unchanged for a sixth meeting on Jan.
11, said the probability of interest-rate cuts has declined as a
weaker zloty fuels inflation. Price growth has remained above
the central bankâ€™s 2.5 percent target for 15 months.  Eastern European policy makers face resurgent price growth
because of weakening currencies and a worsening economic outlook
for the euro area, their biggest export market, which is
grappling with a debt crisis and government austerity. The
region buys 54 percent of Polish exports.  The zloty has dropped 9.8 percent since July, making it the
second-worst performer after the Hungarian forint among
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The declines
have boosted import prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
