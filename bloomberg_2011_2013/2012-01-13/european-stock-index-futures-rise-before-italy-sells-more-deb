European stock futures advanced,
indicating the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index will extend its
fourth weekly gain, as  Italy  prepares to sell more debt. U.S.
index futures and Asian shares also rose.  Futures on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, a benchmark for the
euro region, added 0.8 percent to 2,359 at 7:02 a.m. in  London .
U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index futures also climbed 0.8 percent. The
March contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.2
percent, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.8 percent.  European stocks declined 0.2 percent yesterday after
reports showed U.S. retail sales and initial jobless claims
missed economists’ forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
