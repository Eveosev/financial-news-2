Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ’s information
technology unit T-Systems may post lower earnings as the parent
company limits payments for internal contracts to costs
incurred,  Handelsblatt  said, citing a spokesman from the unit
whom it didn’t identify.  T-Systems’ earnings before interest and tax as a proportion
of sales will probably drop by about 1 percentage point, which
means one-quarter less profit, the German newspaper said, citing
unidentified people from the company.  Contracts from the parent company, which make up about 30
percent of 9.1 billion euros ($11.7 billion) in annual sales,
have been twice as profitable as T-Systems’ average margin,
Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
