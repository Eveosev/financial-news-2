U.S. stock-index futures and the

following a report that several euro-region countries may
face imminent credit downgrades by  Standard & Poor’s .  Futures on the  S&P 500  expiring in March fell 0.8 percent
to 1,281.4 at 9:12 a.m. in New York following the report by Dow
Jones Newswires, which cited European Union sources. The Stoxx
Europe 600 Index slipped 0.4 percent after rallying as much as
0.7 percent earlier. The euro slumped 0.8 percent to $1.2710,

assets down 3.7 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
