E*Trade Securities LLC (ETFC)  agreed to
repurchase auction rate securities from  California  investors in
a settlement worth as much as $20 million that resolves a state
probe alleging the company misrepresented the securitiesâ€™ risks.  The accord will return funds to investors who lost money
when auctions for the securities sold in 2008 failed and their
assets were frozen, the California Department of Corporations
said in an e-mail. E*Trade will also pay $1 million in
penalties, the department said.  Auction-rate securities are long-term debt, primarily
issued by municipalities, with  interest rates  reset periodically
through auctions. The $330 billion market collapsed in 2008 as
dealers stopped bidding to keep auctions from failing, leaving
clients unable to sell their supposedly liquid investments.  The California agency earlier said E*Trade would return
$197 million to investors. The current amount of auction rate
securities held by eligible investors, to which the California
settlement refers, is less than $20 million, said Brett Goodman,
investor relations director at E*Trade Financial Corp. The $197
million refers to balances held in 2008, he said in an e-mail.  The case is In the Matter of E*Trade Securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
