Ford Motor Co. (F) , fueled by growth in
Russia and  Turkey , increased 2011 sales in 51 European markets
surmounting economic challenges, the automaker said today.  Ford sold 1.58 million vehicles, up 2.4 percent, in 51
countries, including emerging markets such as Russia, Romania
and Turkey. In the traditional 19 European markets, Ford’s 2011
sales fell 1.3 percent and its share declined to 8.3 percent
from 8.4 percent in 2010, Ford said in a statement on its
website.  Economic headwinds amid the sovereign debt crisis pushed
down industrywide auto sales by 0.2 percent to 15.3 million in
the 19 traditional markets, Ford said. The automaker on Jan. 4
forecast auto sales in that region will fall to 14 million to 15
million this year. A marketing push in  Germany  helped to boost
Ford’s share there to 7.4 percent in 2011 from 6.9 percent.  “We made solid inroads, particularly in growth markets
such as Russia, Turkey and eastern  Europe , and in Europe’s
largest market, Germany,” Roelant de Waard, Ford’s European
marketing chief, said in a statement. “This is a very good
sign.”  Ford, based in Dearborn, Michigan, wants to replicate in
Germany what the company achieved in the U.S. by using fuel
economy and technology such as voice-activated stereos to
command higher prices from vehicle buyers. The company’s vehicle
sales in Germany for 2011 rose 18 percent, Ford said.  Ford fell 0.8 percent to $12.04 at the close in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
