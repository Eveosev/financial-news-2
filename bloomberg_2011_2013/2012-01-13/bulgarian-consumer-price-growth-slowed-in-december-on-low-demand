Bulgarian  inflation  decelerated in
December as slowing economic growth and rising unemployment
triggered by the euro-area debt crisis cut demand and prices.  Consumer prices rose 2.8 percent from a year earlier, after
a 3.1 percent increase in November, the National Statistics
Institute in the capital, Sofia, said today in a statement. The
median estimate of five economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 3.0
percent. Prices rose 0.1 percent from the previous month.  Bulgaria , the European Unionâ€™s poorest country in terms of
economic output per capita, withstood the global recession in
2009 without an international bailout. Its economic growth
slowed to 1.6 percent from a year earlier in the third quarter,
the weakest in five quarters, as the euro area debt crisis cut
demand for Bulgarian exports.  The  unemployment rate  rose to 10 percent in November as
factories, hotels and farms fired workers or froze hiring.
Factory-gate prices slowed to an annual 5.9 percent in November,
the slowest growth in 18 months, according to Bloomberg data.  The  International Monetary Fund  cut its inflation forecasts
for Bulgaria on Dec. 9 to below 3 percent for 2011 and 3 percent
in 2012, from 4.8 percent and 3.7 percent respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
