A storm that dropped as much as 10
inches of snow in the  Chicago  area is moving east, while warmer-
than-normal weather lies ahead for the end of the month from the
 Rocky Mountains  to the Atlantic, forecasters said.  Average temperatures may be 8 to 14 degrees Fahrenheit (4.4
to 7.8 Celsius) above normal from Jan. 23 to Jan. 27, according
to an 11- to 15-day outlook released today by MDA EarthSat
Weather of Gaithersburg, Maryland.  “An extreme warm pattern is becoming all but certain in
this time frame,” MDA said in a note to clients. By the end of
next week, temperatures will start to rise, Commodity Weather
Group LLC President  Matt Rogers  said in his daily forecast.  Traders use long-range temperature predictions to gauge
energy use and demand for heating and cooling.  Power plants 
consume about 30 percent of the nation’s gas supplies, according
to Energy Department data.  The Chicago area received 6 to 10 inches (15 to 25
centimeters) of snow yesterday, according to the  National
Weather Service . Winter storm warnings and advisories stretch
across the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes into upstate New York and
northern  New England  as snow falls in those areas.  Cleveland is expected to receive 4 to 8 inches and Buffalo
may receive 3 to 6 inches, according to the weather service.  Mid-Month Cold  The month-end warmth will follow a blast of arctic air
across the northern U.S. Temperatures may be 6 to 10 degrees
below normal in the upper Great Plains and  Great Lakes ,
including Chicago, from Jan. 19 to Jan. 23, said  David Salmon ,
meteorologist with Weather Derivatives in Belton, Missouri.  In his 6- to 10-day outlook, Salmon also calls from
temperatures to rise as much as 10 degrees above normal across
parts of the Rocky Mountains, including Colorado and Wyoming,
while much of the East Coast remains seasonal.  In his 6- to 10-day outlook, Rogers, in Bethesda, Maryland,
made a similar forecast. He doesn’t predict that the cold will
drop as far south into the U.S. as Salmon does.  Temperatures in Alberta, including Calgary, may be as much
as 15 degrees below normal from Jan. 18 to Jan. 22, according to
MDA’s 6- to 10-day forecast.  For January 20, the normal average temperature in  New York 
is about 33 degrees, according to MDA. In Boston, it’s about 29;
in Atlanta, 43; in Chicago, 24; Houston, 53; Seattle, 43; and in
Burbank, California, it’s 55.  To contact the reporter on this story:
