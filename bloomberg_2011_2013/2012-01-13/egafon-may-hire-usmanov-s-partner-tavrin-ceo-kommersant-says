Megafon ,  Russia ’s third-largest
wireless operator part-owned by TeliaSonera AB, may appoint Ivan
Tavrin Chief Executive Officer, Kommersant reported, citing
people it didn’t name.  Tavrin, 35, is currently Chairman of billionaire Alisher
Usmanov’s UTH Russia Ltd., the Moscow-based daily said.  Tavrin told Kommersant he will become Megafon’s deputy
chief executive officer this month with a possibility of
promotion once the contract of current CEO Sergei Soldatenkov
expires in June. Usmanov owns a 31 percent stake in Megafon, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
