JPMorgan Chase & Co. ’s investment
bank cut employee compensation 9 percent to $8.88 billion in
2011 as the division generated 0.2 percent more revenue last
year.  The expense, which includes salaries, bonuses and benefits,
was enough to give each of the unit’s 25,999 employees an
average of $341,552, according to figures posted today on the
New York-based company’s website. The division set aside $9.73
billion in 2010 to pay traders, dealmakers and other personnel,
or $369,651 for each of the 26,314 people on  staff (JPM)  at the end of
that year.  JPMorgan’s investment bank had 616 fewer people at the end
of the fourth quarter than at the end of the previous three-
month period and 315 fewer than a year earlier, according to the
disclosure. Staff companywide expanded 8 percent to 260,157 from
2010.  Jes Staley, chief executive officer of JPMorgan’s
investment bank, set aside 34 percent of the division’s revenue
for pay last year, down from 37 percent in 2010.  Investment-bank employees were bracing for a smaller-than-
usual bonus pool even as annual net income for the unit climbed
2 percent to $6.79 billion from a year earlier. A portion of the
division’s quarterly profits came from one-time accounting
adjustments, skewing results.  Quarterly revenue at the investment-banking unit slid last
year from $8.23 billion in the first quarter to $4.36 billion in
the fourth quarter as concerns mounted that the debt crisis in
 Greece  would spread to other European nations.  The average compensation figures, which don’t represent
individual workers’ actual pay, are derived by dividing the
overall compensation pool by the number of employees.  To contact the reporters on this story:
