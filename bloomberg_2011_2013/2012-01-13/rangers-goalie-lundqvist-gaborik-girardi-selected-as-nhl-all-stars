New York Rangers goaltender Henrik Lundqvist and two teammates, defenseman Dan Girardi and forward
Marian Gaborik, have been selected for the National Hockey
League All-Star game.  Forward John Tavares was the only representative from the
 New York Islanders  among the 36 veterans and 12 rookies added
yesterday by the NHL. Six players were elected earlier in fan
balloting. The All-Star game will be Jan. 29 in Ottawa.  After captains and alternate captains are selected, the
 rosters  will be picked at the 2012 NHL All-Star Player Fantasy
Draft on Jan. 26.  Rangers coach John Tortorella and  San Jose ’s Todd McLellan
will lead the squads since their teams were atop the two
conferences at the Jan. 9 cutoff date.  To contact the reporter on this story:
