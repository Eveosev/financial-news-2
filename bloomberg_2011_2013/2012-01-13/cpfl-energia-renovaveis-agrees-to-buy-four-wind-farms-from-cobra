CPFL Energias Renovaveis SA, the
renewable-energy joint venture of ERSA-Energias Renovaveis SA
and  CPFL Energia SA (CPFE3) , will buy four Brazilian wind-power projects
to take advantage of lower turbine costs.  The projects, with a combined capacity of 120 megawatts,
are owned by local developer Cobra Instalaciones y Servicios SA,
Sao Paulo-based CPFL Energia said today in a statement, without
disclosing financial terms.  Falling global demand for wind turbines has damped prices,
boosting sales in  Brazil , according to Rafael Andreata, an
analyst at Sao Paulo-based Planner Corretora de Valores. The
declining cost and the establishment of factories that produce
the equipment have made it an attractive investment in the
country, Andreata said today by telephone.  International wind-turbine prices averaged about 950,000
euros ($1.2 million) a megawatt in the second half of 2011, down
21 percent from the second half of 2009, according to Bloomberg
New Energy Finance data.  The Brazilian projects were awarded contracts to sell
energy in a government-run auction in August 2010, according to
todayâ€™s statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
