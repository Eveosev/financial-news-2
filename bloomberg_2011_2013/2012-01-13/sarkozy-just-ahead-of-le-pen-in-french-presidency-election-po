French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  is
just two percentage points ahead of anti-immigration candidate
Marine Le Pen less than four months before the presidential
election, an Ifop poll for Paris Match showed.  In the first round, to be held April 22, Socialist
candidate Francois Hollande would finish first with 27 percent,
followed by Sarkozy with 23.5 percent and National Front
candidate Le Pen on 21.5 percent, the poll published today
showed today.  The top two vote getters then go to a decisive run-off on
May 6, in which Hollande would beat Sarkozy 57 percent to 43
percent, according to the poll. Ifop polled 943 voters Jan. 9-
12. No margin of error was given.  To contact the reporter on this story:
