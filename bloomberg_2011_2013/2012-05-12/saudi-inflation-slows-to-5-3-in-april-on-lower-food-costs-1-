Saudi Arabia ’s inflation rate slowed
to 5.3 percent in April from 5.4 percent in the previous month
as the cost of food and beverages declined.  Food and beverage prices slid an annual 4.3 percent in
April from 5.1 percent in March, the  Central Department of
Statistics  said on its website today. Goods and other services
fell an annual 6.9 percent in April from 7.1 percent in March.
Consumer prices rose 0.2 percent on a monthly basis.  Saudi government plans to spend more than $500 billion have
spurred inflation to the highest rate in the six-member Gulf
Cooperation Council. The council includes Oman, Bahrain,  Kuwait ,
Qatar and the  United Arab Emirates .  Pressure on prices in Saudi Arabia, the largest Arab
economy, will continue into the second quarter, affecting rent,
food and beverages, and commodities, the kingdom’s central bank
said in a  quarterly report  posted on its website on May 10.  Housing, fuel and water costs accelerated an annual 9.2
percent in April from 8.9 percent in March, according to the
Department of Statistics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
