Gilts advanced for a third week,
driving 10-year yields to a record low, as signs the  European
debt crisis  is worsening spurred demand for the relative safety
of U.K. government debt.  The pound rose for a fourth week against the euro, reaching
its strongest level in 3 1/2 years. Gilts gained as Greek
politicians struggled to form a new government, increasing
concern the nation will withdraw from the common-currency bloc.
The  Bank of England  halted its bond-purchase program, or
quantitative easing, at 325 billion pounds ($420 billion) on May
10 amid concern inflation is accelerating.  “Gilts still benefit from safe-haven demand amid the
uncertainty surrounding  Europe ,” said Eric Wand, a fixed-income
strategist at Lloyds Banking Group Plc in London. “If we go to
another round of Greek elections, that prolongs the uncertainty
in the market, and uncertainty in an environment of slowing
growth will underpin demand for safety.”  The 10-year  yield  fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, this week to 1.96 percent at 4:30 p.m.  London 
time. The 4 percent bond due March 2022 rose 0.325, or 3.25
pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 118.13. The yield dropped
to 1.881 percent on May 9, the lowest since Bloomberg began
compiling the data in 1989.  Demand for U.K. government bonds this week pushed the
 difference  between two- and 10-year yields to the narrowest in
more than three years.  The spread was at 154 basis points yesterday after
shrinking to 150 basis points on May 9, the least since January
2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg based on closing
prices.  Double-Dip  With the U.K. suffering its first double-dip recession
since 1975, the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee, led by
Governor  Mervyn King , had to balance the need to bolster the
economy with the threat of inflation, which has been above their
2 percent target for more than two years. The MPC made its
decision with new quarterly economic forecasts that will be
published next week.  The central bank left its benchmark  interest rate  at a
record-low 0.5 percent, a level set in March 2009.  “The Bank of England may have disappeared for now, but
they may make it clear that this is a suspension, not a
termination, of QE,” Wand said.  Sterling Declines  Sterling fell against the dollar and euro yesterday as
signs the economic outlook is worsening raised the prospect that
King will hint at resuming bond purchases when the central bank
releases its Inflation Report on May 16.  “They’ll have no choice but to revise down their growth
projections” in the Inflation Report, said  George Buckley , an
economist at Deutsche Bank AG in London. “They have a dilemma
of high inflation and very weak growth, but you definitely can’t
rule more QE out.”  The pound gained 0.8 percent this week to 80.41 pence per
euro, after rising to 79.97 pence yesterday, the strongest since
November 2008. Sterling dropped 0.4 percent to $1.6089. It fell
to $1.6062 yesterday, the lowest level since April 20.  The U.K. currency has appreciated 4.4 percent in the past
three months, the best performer of the 10 developed-nation
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The dollar gained 2 percent, and the euro was 0.2 percent
weaker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
