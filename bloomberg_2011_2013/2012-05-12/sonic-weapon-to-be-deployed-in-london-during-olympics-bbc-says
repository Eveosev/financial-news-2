A device that can be used as a
“sonic weapon” will be deployed in London during the  Olympic
Games , the  BBC  reported, citing the U.K. Ministry of Defence.  The American-made Long Range Acoustic Device can be used to
send verbal warnings over a long distance or emit a beam of
pain-inducing tones, the BBC said. The equipment was spotted
fixed to a landing craft on the  River Thames  at Westminster,
London, this week, it said.  The device would be used primarily in the loud hailer mode,
the BBC citing an MoD spokesman as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
