Volvo AB (VOLVB)  is investing more than 100
million euros ($129 million) in a Belgian factory to produce its
new V40 model starting May 14, La Libre Belgique  reported ,
citing an interview with Geert Bruyneel, the plant’s managing
director.  Volvo’s Ghent factory is running close to its full capacity
of 280,000 vehicles a year and plans to produce 27,000 V40 cars
this year, which may eventually rise to as many as 100,000 per
year, La Libre said. The company spent 55 million euros last
year and plans to spend 52 million euros this year to switch the
plant’s production away from the S40 and V50 models, Bruyneel
was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
