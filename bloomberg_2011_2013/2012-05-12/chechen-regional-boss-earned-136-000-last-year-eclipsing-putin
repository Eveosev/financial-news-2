Ramzan Kadyrov, the Kremlin-backed
leader of Chechnya, earned 4.1 million rubles last year
($136,000), surpassing Russian President  Vladimir Putin  and
Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev , the regional government said.  Kadyrov’s entire income came from his official salary,
according to a  statement  published on the government website
today. His allowance also included the use of a 36-square-meter
(388-square-foot) state-provided apartment. Kadyrov’s wife owns
a 209.8-square-meter apartment jointly with her two daughters,
the government said.  Putin declared income of 3.7 million rubles last year,
while Medvedev earned 3.4 million rubles. Putin groomed Kadyrov
to lead the conflict-wracked republic after the former
militant’s father, Akhmad, the region’s president at the time,
was killed in a bomb attack in 2004.  Federal forces fought two wars against separatist rebels in
Chechnya. Bombings and attacks continue to flare up in the
region, with the government blaming Islamist fighters and
insurgents for the violence.  Medvedev, who surrendered his right to seek a second
presidential term to allow for Putin’s return to the Kremlin,
sought increased transparency about government officials’
earnings as part of a campaign against corruption during his
term in office.  Acting Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Khloponin, who is
also the president’s representative to southern  Russia ’s mostly
Muslim republics, and his wife became the biggest earners among
Cabinet members last year, making a combined 488.8 million
rubles, government declarations showed last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
