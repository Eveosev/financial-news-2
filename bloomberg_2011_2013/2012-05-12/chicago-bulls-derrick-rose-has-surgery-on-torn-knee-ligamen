Chicago Bulls guard  Derrick Rose ,
last year’s National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player,
had surgery yesterday to repair a torn ligament in his left knee.  Rose, 23, tore the anterior cruciate ligament in the fourth
quarter of the Bulls’ win over the  Philadelphia 76ers  in the
first game of the Eastern Conference playoffs on April 28.  Additional information on Rose’s prognosis will be
disclosed next week, the Bulls said in an e-mail. The team
called the surgery “successful.”  “The surgery went great,” his older brother Reggie Rose
told the  Chicago Tribune . “He’s not sitting out the entire year.
We’re just going to bring him back slowly.”  Rehabilitation may take as long as 10 months.  “The biggest thing to do is not put a time limit on it,
just when he feels comfortable,” Reggie Rose said. “When he
comes back, he has to learn how to trust his body. I tore my ACL
in college. It’s him learning how to trust his body.”  Rose, who scored 23 points against the 76ers in the Bulls’
103-91 victory on April 28, averaged 21.8 points and 3.4
rebounds this season. He missed 27 of 66 regular-season games
because of injuries. The Bulls won 18 of those games and lost
nine when he didn’t play.  The Bulls, the top seed in the conference who tied the  San
Antonio Spurs  for the best record in the league, lost the best-
of-seven series as the 76ers won four games to Chicago’s two
victories.  To contact the reporter on this story:
