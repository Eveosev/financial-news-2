Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the state
 oil company , will sell as much as $3 billion in 23-year bonds,
ending a six-month halt in its sales of dollar-denominated debt.  The bonds will pay interest of 9.75 percent and will be
sold in a private placement to Venezuela’s central bank and
public lenders, according to a statement posted on the company’s
website.  The oil producer known as PDVSA hasn’t sold dollar bonds
since November, when it privately placed $2.4 billion of debt
with the central bank. The company’s bonds rallied this year on
speculation that President  Hugo Chavez , who depends on PDVSA to
finance his government, may not be fit to stand for re-election
and that a new administration may reverse policies that have
caused oil production to stagnate.  PDVSA will use proceeds from the bond sale to finance
projects including social development programs, according to the
statement.  Net income surged 42 percent to $4.5 billion in 2011 on
$124 billion of revenue, the oil company said April 17. Total
debt rose 40 percent last year to $34.9 billion after PDVSA sold
$10.3 billion of dollar-denominated bonds to finance the
development of new oil projects and government social programs.  PDVSA President  Rafael Ramirez  said last month that PDVSA’s
debt levels are “comfortable” and that there’s room to borrow
more in coming years amid efforts to tap heavy crude reserves in
the Orinoco belt with private partners including  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ,
 Eni SpA (ENI)  and Repsol YPF SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
