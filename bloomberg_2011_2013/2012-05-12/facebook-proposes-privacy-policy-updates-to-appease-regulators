Facebook Inc. (FB) , responding to a
European regulator’s request, proposed privacy-policy changes
that would disclose more information on how it handles user
data.  Under a proposal, Facebook would publish more detail on how
long data can be held, what happens when accounts are
deactivated and what kinds of ads could be shown to users even
when they’re not on Facebook’s pages, the  Menlo Park ,
California-based company said today on its site.  Ireland’s data-protection agency, which regulates
Facebook’s Irish affiliate, had encouraged the social-networking
service to enhance guidelines. Facebook, which plans to raise as
much as $11.8 billion in an initial public offering as soon as
next week, is stepping up efforts to safeguard user data and
inform people how their information is handled.  “We’re adding more examples and detailed explanations to
help you understand our policies,” Erin Egan, Facebook’s chief
privacy officer for policy, said in a blog posting on the site.  Facebook has come under scrutiny from regulators in the
U.S. as well, and last year agreed to settle complaints by the
U.S.  Federal Trade Commission  that it failed to protect users’
privacy or disclose how their data could be used.  To contact the reporter on this story:
