California ’s budget deficit has
swelled to $16 billion after tax collections trailed projections
amid the tepid economic recovery, Governor  Jerry Brown  said in a
comment on his Twitter post.  The shortfall has widened from the $9.2 billion Brown
estimated in January, after lawmakers resisted the Democrat’s
call for cost cuts, the federal government blocked other
reductions and April income-tax revenue missed budget forecasts
by $2 billion. On May 14, he’s set to unveil a revised spending
plan and to say how he would erase the gap.  Brown, 74, set out an initial  budget  in January with $92.6
billion in spending for fiscal 2013, which begins in July. That
plan stripped more than $4 billion from health and welfare
programs while relying on higher income and sales taxes. The
levy increases will go before voters in November. If rejected,
schools will lose $4.8 billion midway through the year.  “We are still recovering from the worst recession since
the 1930s,” Brown said in a YouTube video cited on his Twitter
post. “Tax receipts are coming lower than expected and the
federal government and the courts have blocked us from making
billions of necessary budget reductions. The result is that we
are now facing a $16 billion deficit.”  Brown this week submitted more than 1.5 million signatures
to place the tax measure on the ballot. It would temporarily
raise the  state sales tax , already the highest in the U.S., to
7.5 percent from 7.25 percent. It would also boost rates on
income starting at $250,000. The 10.3 percent levy on those
making $1 million or more would rise to 13.3 percent, the most
of any state.  To contact the reporter on this story:
