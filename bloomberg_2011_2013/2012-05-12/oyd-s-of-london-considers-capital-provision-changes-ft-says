The means by which wealthy
individuals provide capital to  Lloyd’s of London Ltd.  should
change because it is not sustainable, the  Financial Times 
reported, citing the insurance market’s Chief Executive Officer
Richard Ward.  The method by which Lloyd’s “names” invest in the market
is over-complicated and he is keen that the  company  finds a more
efficient way for new investors to do so, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
