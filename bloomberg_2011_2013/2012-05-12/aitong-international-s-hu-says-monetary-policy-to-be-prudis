(Corrects headline and quote to say “prudent” instead of
“prudish” in story originally published May 12.)  Yifan Hu, chief economist at  Haitong
International Securities (665)  comments on China’s move to cut reserve
requirement ratios by 50 basis points on May 18. Hu commented in
an e-mail.  On China’s  monetary policy :  “It is well in line with our expectation. We forecast the
rate cut after the April data was announced, as we expected the
real economy to decelerate too fast. Monetary policy is expected
to remain prudent, as inflationary pressure stays high this year.
Meanwhile, we expect more supportive fiscal policy, mainly in
the field of infrastructure projects.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
