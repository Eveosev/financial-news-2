Kevin Na takes a one-stroke lead into
today’s final round of the U.S. PGA Tour’s Players Championship,
while Tiger Woods trails by 10.  Following a round of 4-under-par 68 yesterday, Na stood 12-
under at 204 after 54 holes in the tournament at TPC Sawgrass in
 Ponte Vedra Beach ,  Florida . He birdied two of the last three
holes to take the lead over  Matt Kuchar , who shot a 69 that put
him one stroke back at 11-under 205.  “I know how to play under pressure,” Na said. “I’ve won
before. I’ve been in situations like this. I’ve got to take
everything I’ve learned and do my best.”  Rickie Fowler was third at 9-under 207 after shooting a 66,
while Woods was at 2-under 214 following an even-par round.  Woods had two birdies and two bogeys yesterday. He made
four straight birdies in the second round to avoid missing a
second straight cut after failing to qualify for weekend play at
last week’s Wells Fargo Championship.  “I played well today and didn’t get anything out of that
round,” Woods told reporters. “It was probably the most solid
I’ve hit the golf ball all year, actually. Even though I hit a
couple off line, they were just hit dead flush. I just got
nothing out of the round.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
