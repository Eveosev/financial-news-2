German bunds surged, sending the
nation’s borrowing costs to all-time lows, while  Greece ’s bonds
sank as a political stalemate following inconclusive elections
renewed concern it will exit the euro bloc.  Yields on two-, five, 10- and 30-year German bonds fell to
records as Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  suggested the
euro-region could handle Greece dropping out of the 17-nation
currency group. Greek 10-year bonds slid, pushing the price
below that of the security it replaced in the biggest-ever debt
restructuring two months ago. Spain’s 10-year bonds dropped the
most in more than a month after the European Commission forecast
the nation’s economy will contract this year and next.  “The main driver this week was the problems in Greece and
the failure to form a coalition government,” said Sercan Eraslan, a fixed-income strategist at WestLB AG in Dusseldorf,
 Germany . “While the Greek situation remains uncertain, with the
risk that they may drop out of the euro, bund yields will stay
lower and Greek bonds will be under pressure. Fears of a deeper
recession are also dominating sentiment.”  The German 10-year yield dropped seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, this week to 1.52 percent at 4:43 p.m.
London time yesterday, when it fell to a record 1.49 percent.
The 1.75 percent bond due July 2022 gained 0.205, or 2.05 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 102.165.  Thirty-year bund yields slipped 10 basis points to 2.20
percent and reached an all-time low for the sixth day yesterday,
touching 2.188 percent.  Deadlocked Talks  The price of Greece’s 2 percent bond maturing in 2023 sank
24 percent over the week to 18.61 percent of face value, below
the 19.005 closing level of the bond it superseded in the March
9 restructuring.  Greece’s bonds tumbled as deadlocked talks over the
formation of a new government reignited concern the nation won’t
meet the terms of two international bailouts, increasing the
risk it will leave the euro currency bloc and fail to pay back
its creditors.  Schaeuble told Rheinische Post newspaper that the euro area
could handle a Greek departure as “the risks of contagion for
other countries of the euro zone have been reduced.”  Spain ’s  10-year yield  climbed 27 basis points to 6.01
percent. The extra yield investors demand to hold the bonds
instead of similar-maturity German bunds widened to 459 basis
points on May 9, the most since Nov. 23.  Shrinking Economies  Spain’s economy will probably shrink 1.8 percent this year
and 0.3 percent in 2013, the European Commission said yesterday.
Euro-region gross domestic product will rise 1 percent in 2013
after declining 0.3 percent in 2012, it said. Greece will have
the deepest slump this year, with GDP declining 4.7 percent.  Data next week will show German investor confidence fell
for the first time in six months in May, according to a
Bloomberg survey of economists. The ZEW index of investor and
analyst expectations dropped to 19 from 23.4 in April, according
to the survey.  Italy will sell bonds due between 2015 and 2022 next week,
while France, Germany and Spain also sell debt.  German debt has returned 2.2 percent this year, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies.  To contact the reporters on this story:
