India ’s Defense Ministry has approved
a proposal to buy 145 ultra-light howitzer artillery guns from
U.S.-based  BAE Systems Inc. (BA/)  for about 30 billion rupees ($560
million), the  Wall Street Journal  reported, citing a senior
ministry official.  The proposal to buy the M777 artillery guns was cleared
yesterday by the Defense Acquisitions Council, according to the
official, who didn’t want to be identified. The signing of a
final contract may take some more months after completion of
cost negotiations, the newspaper said.  “This will be a direct government-to-government deal
between India and the U.S. under the U.S. government’s foreign
military sales route,” a person familiar with the matter told
the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
