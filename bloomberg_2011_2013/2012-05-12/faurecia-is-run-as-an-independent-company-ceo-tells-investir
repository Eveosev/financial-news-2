Faurecia SA (EO)  is run as a totally
independent company without interference from its  majority
shareholder , PSA  Peugeot (UG)  Citroen,  Investir  reported, citing
Chief Executive Officer Yann Delabriere.  Faurecia is “100 percent independent,” Delabriere told
the French weekly newspaper in an  interview  published today. The
company is 57 percent owned by Paris-based Peugeot, Europe’s
second-biggest carmaker.  The tie-up between Peugeot and  General Motors Co. (GM)  is a good
opportunity for Faurecia, Delabriere also told Investir.  To contact the reporter on this story:
