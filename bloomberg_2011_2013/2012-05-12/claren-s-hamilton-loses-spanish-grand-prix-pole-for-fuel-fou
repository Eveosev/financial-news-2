McLaren’s  Lewis Hamilton  was dropped
from pole position for tomorrow’s Spanish Grand Prix for not
returning to the pits after his qualifying run, race officials
said in a statement on the Formula One website.  Hamilton topped today’s qualifying but stopped on the track
in order to leave the sufficient amount of fuel in his tank for
post-race testing.  Pastor Maldonado of Williams, who qualified second fastest,
will now start on the pole, with Hamilton dropped to the back of
the grid, officials said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
