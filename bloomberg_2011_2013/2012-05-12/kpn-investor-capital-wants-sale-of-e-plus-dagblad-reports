Royal KPN NV (KPN) ’s largest shareholder,
Capital, has expressed discontent with the telephone company
since November and wants it to sell E-Plus, Het Financieele
Dagblad  reported  today, without citing anyone.  KPN hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co.
to explore strategic options, including a sale of its BASE unit
in  Belgium .  The U.S. shareholder mostly wants to monetize KPN’s German
unit E-Plus, according to the newspaper. Capital has a stake of
more than 20 percent in KPN, Dagblad reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
