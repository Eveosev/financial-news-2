Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS) , the U.K.’s
 largest  clothing retailer, is to make a fresh foray into branded
goods when it begins stocking a selection of beauty products,
the Financial Times reported, without citing sources.  The move by the London-based  company  is expected to be
announced with its annual results in 10 days’ time, the
newspaper said. While M&S wouldn’t comment, the FT said it
understands that the retailer is planning to introduce a range
of third-party beauty brands in to selected stores.  It is thought that all of the brands would be exclusive to
M&S, the FT said, including Nuxe, the French natural beauty and
skincare range.  To contact the reporter on this story:
