Barcelona captain Carles Puyol
underwent arthropscopic knee surgery today that will keep him
out of soccer’s European Championship.  Puyol, 34, had loose cartilage removed from his knee and
will be sidelined six weeks, Barcelona doctor Ricard Pruna said
on the club’s website.  The defender will miss  Spain ’s title defense at Euro 2012,
which begins June 10 against  Italy , as well as the Copa del Rey
final with Athletic Bilbao on May 25.  “His objective is to be in optimal condition for the
preseason,” Pruna said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
