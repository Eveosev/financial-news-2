Australian Sam Groth hit the fastest
recorded serve in professional tennis with a 163 miles per hour
(263 kilometers per hour) ace during an event in  South Korea .  The ATP World Tour said on its  website  today the 24-year-
old, ranked 340th in the world, produced the serve at a second-
tier Challenger Tour tournament three days ago. Groth lost the
second-round match 6-4, 6-3 to Uladzimir Ignatik of Belarus.  The ATP said it doesn’t officially recognize service speed
records because of variance in radar guns, but “confirmed that
the event used approved equipment, and that other data gathered
appeared within a normal range.”  The previous fastest-recorded serve of 156 mph was hit by
Croatia’s  Ivo Karlovic  during a Davis Cup match against Germany
in March 2011, the ATP said. Groth also had serves recorded at
159 mph and 158 mph during his match, the ATP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
