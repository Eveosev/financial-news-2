European regulators are studying
alternatives offered by  ING Groep NV (INGA)  for the sale of its
mortgage lender WestlandUtrecht Bank, European Union Competition
Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  told Het Financieele Dagblad.  ING has indicated a sale, one of the EUâ€™s conditions for
approving state aid in 2008 and 2009, is impossible. The
Amsterdam based company also has to divest its entire insurance
operations before the end of 2013.  The EU will study alternatives offered by ING, including an
integration of WestlandUtrecht Bank in its Dutch Nationale-
Nederlanden insurance unit, the newspaper  reported  today, citing
Almunia.  Almunia also expects ING will agree on compensation terms
for not paying coupons to the Dutch state over a bailout
received in 2009, even as it reported profits, according to the
paper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
