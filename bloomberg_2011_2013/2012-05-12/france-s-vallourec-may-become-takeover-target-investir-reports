Vallourec SA (VK) ’s recent share price
decline may make it a takeover target,  Investir  reported today,
without saying how it obtained the information.  The French producer of steel pipes for the oil and gas
industry  tumbled  20 percent to 34.30 euros in Paris trading
yesterday, the most since at least 1989, after cutting its
forecast for sales growth by half and missing profit estimates.  At 34 euros ($43.92) a share, the Boulogne-Billancourt,
France-based company could become attractive for French
billionaire investor Vincent  Bollore (BOL)  or some other business
seeking a bargain, the French weekly newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
