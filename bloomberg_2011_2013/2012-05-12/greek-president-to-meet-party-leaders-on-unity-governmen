Greek President Karolos Papoulias
will meet Sunday, May 13, at 12:00 Athens time with the leaders
of all parties elected to the Greek parliament in May 6 general
elections.  The president will first have discussions with the leaders
of  New Democracy , Syriza and the Pasok parties, who each have
had mandates to form governments in the past week. He will then
meet the leaders of the four other parties elected to
parliament, Papouliasâ€™s office said in an e-mailed statement
today.  The meetings are aimed at forming a national unity
government after the attempts by the three biggest parties
failed. The Greek constitution requires that the president hold
such meetings, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
