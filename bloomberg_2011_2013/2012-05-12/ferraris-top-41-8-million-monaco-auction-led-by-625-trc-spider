Ferraris led by a 625 TRC Spider took
the top three lots in a $41.8 million auction as the Italian
maker continues to attract classic-car investors.  The Spider, raced in  California  during the 1950s, was one
of 22 classic Ferraris offered by  RM Auctions  in  Monaco  in a
two-day weekend event. It sold for 5 million euros ($6.5
million) including fees to a telephone buyer against multiple
underbidders.  Ferrari SpA remains the top brand for both established
collectors and wealthy individuals looking to diversify their
investments. New buyers appreciate the security of a big
carmaker that still exists, said dealers.  “Ferrari trumps all other names in terms of prestige and
liquidity,” the Geneva-based auto adviser Simon Kidston said in
an interview before the sale. “If you have a good car that’s
 priced  correctly, you can find a buyer within hours.”  The 1957 V-12 had been purchased new in 1957 by the West
Coast-based Ferrari dealer and racer John van Neumann. Restored
in the 1980s, after losing its original engine, the car had been
valued at 3 million euros to 3.7 million euros in an event timed
to coincide with the biannual  Grand Prix de Monaco Historique .  The auction, featuring 94 cars, raised 32.4 million euros,
slightly below the 33 million euros achieved at the company’s
inaugural event in 2010, RM said. The event had a sell-through
rate of 87 percent by volume, said the Canadian-based company.  Among other “prancing horse” classics to sell, a 1966
Ferrari 206 S Dino Spyder and a 225 Sport Spyder “Tuboscocca,”
dating from 1952, each made 2.5 million euros.  Schumacher Car  A works Formula One car that had been raced by  Michael Schumacher  in the 2000 Austrian Grand Prix went for 806,400
euros. It had been valued at as much as 850,000 euros and had
been raced in the Austrian Grand Prix in 2000, when it retired
on the first lap following a collision.  The most highly estimated Ferrari was a 375 MM Spider
dating from 1953 that had been successfully raced in  Argentina 
in the mid-1950s and more recently in the Mille Miglia Storica.
Estimated at 3.3 million euros to 4.1 million euros, it failed
to sell. Dealers said it was not entirely fresh to the market.  A Timossi-Ferrari “Arno XI” hydroplane, which set a world
speed record in its class of 241.7 kilometers an hour (150 miles
per hour) in 1953, had generated headlines about “my other
Ferrari’s a boat.” Even so, it also struggled to attract
bidders. It sold for 868,000 euros against a low estimate of 1
million euros.  Rising Market  The unusually large entry of Ferraris was partly a
consequence of RM no longer holding sales at the Italian maker’s
headquarters at Maranello -- and owners’ willingness to offer
cars in a rising market, said dealers.  A Ferrari GTO, one of 36 produced in 1962 to 1963, was
bought this year in a private transaction in the U.K. for about
$32 million, the second highest price ever paid for a classic
car.  Prices for classic Ferraris increased 4.82 percent in the
first quarter of 2012, according to data compiled by the London-
based Historic Automobile Group International ( HAGI ).  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
