Jianguang Shen, chief Asia economist
at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd., comments on China’s central
bank’s move to cut banks’ reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis
points. Shen commented in an email interview today.  On China stabilizing growth:  “For the government to stabilize growth, it would have to
rely on more decisive actions to bolster investment, in order to
fill the gap from reduced external demand, such as selective
relaxation on property tightening and local government financing
vehicle loans.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
