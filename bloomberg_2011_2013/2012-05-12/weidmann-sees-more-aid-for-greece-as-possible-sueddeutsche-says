European Central Bank council member
Jens Weidmann said further financial support for  Greece  can be
considered if the country sticks to its promises,  Sueddeutsche 
Zeitung reported, citing an interview.  “If Greece isn’t keeping its word then it is a democratic
decision,” Weidmann, who also heads  Germany ’s Bundesbank, is
quoted as saying. “Consequently, it misses the basis for
further financial support.”  Weidman also said that it is still not time to drop the
extended credit support measures, Sueddeutsche said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
