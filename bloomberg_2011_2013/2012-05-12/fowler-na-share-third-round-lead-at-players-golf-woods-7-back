Rickie Fowler and Kevin Na share the
lead in the third round of the U.S. PGA Tour’s Players
Championship. Tiger Woods trails by seven shots after shooting
an even-par 72.  Fowler is 6 under par through 15 holes today and 9 under
for the tournament. Na, who shared the overnight lead with  Zach
Johnson  and  Matt Kuchar , is 1 under through five holes.  Kuchar is even par through five holes to sit in third place
at 8 under. Johnson made an early bogey to drop to 7 under, tied
for fourth with Blake Adams.  Woods had two birdies and two bogeys in his round today.
The 14-time major winner made four straight birdies yesterday to
avoid missing his second straight cut after failing to qualify
for weekend play at last week’s Wells Fargo Championship.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
