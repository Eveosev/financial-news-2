Spain  may need to pump 5 billion
euros ($6.4 billion) into Bankia Group to boost the lenderâ€™s
capital,  Expansion  reported, citing unidentified people close to
the government.  The cash injection will be implemented through the purchase
of capital contingent notes to be issued by the nationalized
lender, Expansion said. Previously the government was expecting
to inject 2.5 billion euros of new capital, Expansion said.  The measure will be on top of the conversion of 4.5 billion
euros of subordinated debt sold two years ago by the bank to the
government-run bank bailout fund, or Frob, into new stock,
Expansion said.  A Madrid-based spokeswoman at the  Economy Ministry  declined
to comment. No press officer at Bankia was available to comment
when contacted by Bloomberg after business hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
