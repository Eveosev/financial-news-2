The French prefer Prime Minister
 Francois Fillon  as a new head of outgoing President  Nicolas
Sarkozy ’s political party, according to an  Ifop  poll to be
published tomorrow in  Sud Ouest Dimanche   France .  For 27 percent of the French, Fillon is best positioned to
lead the  Union for a Popular Movement party  in the coming years,
the Ifop poll showed. Twenty percent prefer Foreign Affairs
Minister  Alain Juppe  as new chief, while 13 percent picked Jean- Francois Cope, the current UMP head.  In the autumn, Cope’s term as party leader comes up for
review, with Fillon among the probable challengers. Sarkozy has
said he will leave politics after his defeat. The UMP is
fighting to keep recriminations and rivalries in check for at
least another six weeks to prevent President-elect Francois Hollande’s Socialists from taking control of Parliament.  The poll for the newspaper by the Ifop polling company
questioned 1,000 people 18 years or older through the Internet
on May 10 and May 11. It didn’t provide the poll’s margin of
error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
