Oud Sluis , a Michelin three-starred
restaurant in the Netherlands listed as the world’s  21st best ,
will close, chef Sergio Herman told  De Tijd  in an  interview .  Herman said running the restaurant was “damn hard” and he
didn’t want to end his days serving an oyster dish he’d become
famous for, according to De Tijd. He didn’t give a date for the
closure of the restaurant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
