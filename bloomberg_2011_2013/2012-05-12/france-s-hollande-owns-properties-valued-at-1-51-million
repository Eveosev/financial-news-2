French President-elect  Francois Hollande , who portrayed himself as a “normal man” during the
election campaign, owns properties worth 1.17 million euros
($1.51 million), according to a government publication.  Hollande has a 130-square-meter house in Mougins, a town in
southern  France , which is worth 800,000 euros, according to the
document, published yesterday by the  Journal Officiel de la
Republique Francaise  and available online. He also partially
owns two apartments in Cannes, on the French Riviera, shows the
document, based on declarations Hollande made on March 15.  The President-elect declared 8,260 euros on three different
bank accounts, two of them with  Societe Generale SA (GLE) , the
country’s second-biggest bank, and one with La Banque Postale.
The Socialist also declared owning furniture worth 15,000 euros.
He has five loans, three of them with banks, and must repay more
than 255,000 euros to his creditors, according to the document.
The President-elect declared owning no stocks and no works of
art or jewels, the document shows.  Hollande beat PresidentNicolas Sarkozy in the second round
of elections that took place May 6. The Socialist candidate
sought to portray himself as the anti-Sarkozy leader, calling
himself “normal” in contrast with the incumbent, portrayed in
the media as “President bling-bling.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
