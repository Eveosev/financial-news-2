World Bank President  Robert Zoellick ,
who served in three Republican administrations, declined to say
whether he will advise presumed Republican presidential nominee
 Mitt Romney  when his mandate ends next month.  “In this job, I haven’t been able to be engaged in
politics,” Zoellick said in an interview on CNN’s “Fareed
Zakaria GPS,” to be broadcast today. “So that question will
have to wait until I leave on June 30,” he said when asked
whether he would be more active in advising Romney once he steps
down from his current position.  Zoellick, who was nominated for the World Bank job by
Republican President  George W. Bush  in 2007, has held positions
including U.S. trade representative and deputy secretary of
state. While refraining from commenting on this year’s
presidential election, he was critical of the Obama
administration’s trade policy and of political squabbling over
the U.S. debt limit last year.  “Historically, I’ve tried to be of help, but I’ve always
tried to work across the aisle,” he said, according to a
transcript of the interview.  He said he was disappointed that a report by the co-
chairmen of the 2010 bipartisan fiscal commission, Erskine Bowles and  Alan Simpson , wasn’t pursed by the Democratic Obama
administration. The U.S.  tax code  needs to be changed, he said.  “The tax code has now become riddled again with a whole
series of inefficiencies and special favors,” he said. “I
think on the tax side, the main message is broaden the base and
lower the rates.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
