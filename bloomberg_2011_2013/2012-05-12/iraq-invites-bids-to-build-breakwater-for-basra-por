Iraq  invited international bids to
build a breakwater and service pier for the Grand Faw Port in
the southern province of Basra, the Transport Ministry said
today in a statement posted on its website.  Bids are due by July 15, according to the statement.
Interested bidders should attend a clarification meeting on May
28 at the state-run Iraq Ports Company in Basra, it said.  The project will be financed by the Iraqi government and
falls within its 2012 budget. Bidders should have implemented at
least three similar projects in the last 10 years and have a
traded capital of no less than the equivalent of 200 million
euros ($259 million).  Iraq holds the world’s fifth-largest crude deposits
including Canadian  oil sands , according to data from  BP Plc. (BP/)  The
government is trying to attract foreign investment and expertise
to help rebuild the infrastructure and boost energy exports in
order to revive an economy shattered by years of conflict,
sanctions and sabotage.  On March 5, Omran Radhi, director general of the State
Company for Iraq’s Ports, said the government allocated $341
million to build the breakwater as part of the planned $6
billion port in the southern part of the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
