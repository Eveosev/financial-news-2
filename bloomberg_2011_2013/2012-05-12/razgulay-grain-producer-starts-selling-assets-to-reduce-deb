OAO  Razgulay Group (GRAZ)  started selling
non-core assets to help cut debt and its ratio to earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciatiopn and amortization, the
Russian grain and sugar producer said.  Razgulay sold land and a 25 percent stake in a grain
storage plant, the company said today in a statement without
disclosing the proceeds.  The company is seeking to get about 6 billion rubles ($199
million) from selling some of its assets in 2012 and 2013,
Interfax reported today, citing an earlier interview with
Razgulay Chairman Rustem Mirgalimov.  To contact the reporter on this story:
