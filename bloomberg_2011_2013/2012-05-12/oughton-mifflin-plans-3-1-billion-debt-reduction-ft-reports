Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing
Co. plans to eliminate $3.1 billion of debt in its second
restructuring in a little more than two years, the  Financial
Times  reported, without saying where it got the information.  The Boston-based educational publishing and services
company’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy will convert debt held by groups
including Paulson & Co. Inc., the hedge fund run by  John Paulson , into 100 percent of the group’s equity, the newspaper
said.  The announcement will wipe out the equity that senior
lenders took in a Feb. 10 restructuring that cut debt from $7
billion to about $3 billion. It will bring to an end a period
during which the company has struggled with an over-indebted
 capital structure , the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
