Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer  Robert Iger  sold $81.6 million in stock after
the record-setting box-office performance of “Marvel’s The
Avengers” powered the shares to new highs.  The sale of 1.8 million shares took place on May 10 at an
average price of $45.36, according to a regulatory filing
yesterday. Disney closed at a record on May 9, after the company
outlined plans for an “Avengers” sequel on its second-quarter
earnings call, and set subsequent marks on May 10 and May 11.  Iger, who plans to step down as CEO in March 2015,
exercised options at a cost of $55 million, according to the
filing, suggesting profit of $26.6 million before taxes and
commissions. The sales were part of routine financial planning
to meet his family’s diversification goals, Burbank, California-
based Disney said in a statement.  “Even after today’s transactions, his holdings exceed what
Mr. Iger owned at year-end,” the company said.  Iger retains 1.14 million shares with value that is 400
percent greater than the company’s ownership requirements,
Disney said.  Disney, the world’s largest entertainment company, rose 0.6
percent to $45.56 yesterday in  New York . The shares have climbed
21 percent this year.  Iger became chairman in March, with a contract that runs
through June 2016. The company announced in October that it
would name a new CEO to succeed him in March 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
