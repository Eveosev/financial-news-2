Egypt ’s presidential election must
start as scheduled on May 23, the country’s highest
administrative court said today in Cairo.  The Supreme Administrative Court made the ruling,
overturning a lower-court decision that had suspended procedures
for the vote.  The court also upheld the right of the Election Commission
to challenge a law barring some officials from former President
 Hosni Mubarak ’s administration from running for the presidency.
The decision went against a lower court’s ruling that the
election panel had exceeded its authority by referring the law
to the  Constitutional Court .  Mubarak was forced from office in February 2011 following
pro-democracy protests.  The Muslim Brotherhood, whose top candidate was banned from
the presidential ballot, protested a decision by the Election
Commission to allow Mubarak’s last prime minister, Ahmed Shafik,
to enter the race.  The Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party, the largest in
parliament, has complained that the elected legislature has been
undercut by the ruling military council, its appointed
government and the Election Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
