Asian  stocks  fell, with a regional
index posting its worst week in five months, amid concern Greece
will be forced out of the euro and that austerity plans needed
to contain the Europe’s debt crisis will be derailed.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. , the world’s
largest lender by market value, sank 4.5 percent in  Hong Kong 
this week as the nation’s export growth slowed.  Hutchison
Whampoa Ltd. (13) , which operates ports in Spain and Germany,
declined 5.6 percent in Hong Kong.  Sony Corp. (6758)  fell 11 percent to
the lowest in more than 31 years after the maker of Bravia
televisions and PlayStation game consoles forecast profit that
lagged analyst estimates by half.  “Europe remains the biggest issue facing markets,” said
 Andrew Pease , Sydney-based chief investment strategist for the
Asia-Pacific region at Russell Investment Group, which manages
about $150 billion. “It’s not clear how deep the downturn is
going to be and the effect this is going to have elsewhere.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Japan Index (MXAP)  declined 4.4 percent to
118.61 this week. That’s the steepest weekly slide since the
last week of November as France’s political changes and
instability in Greece threaten to derail austerity plans and
worsen Europe’s debt crisis. Stocks extended losses yesterday as
JPMorgan Chase & Co. said it had a $2 billion trading loss as
positions in credit securities proved riskier than expected.  Shanghai Stocks  China’s  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  dropped 2.3 percent. A
report released on May 9 showed the nation’s exports rose less
than economists’ estimates in April, putting pressure on policy
makers to pledge stimulus measures to boost growth. Industrial
output in the world’s second-largest economy rose 9.3 percent
from a year earlier in April, a government report showed
yesterday. That missed the 12.2 percent median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of 32 economists.  Chinese lenders and shipping companies dropped. ICBC, as
China’s biggest bank is known, slipped 4.5 percent to HK$4.89.
 China Construction Bank Corp. (939) , the second-largest, slipped 5.9
percent to HK$5.59. China COSCO Holdings Co., the nation’s No. 1
shipping line, tumbled 14 percent to HK$3.86.  Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  fell 2.5 percent, while
Korea’s Kospi Index dropped 0.7 percent. Japan’s  Nikkei 225
Stock Average (NKY)  slid 4.6 percent, a sixth consecutive weekly loss.  Europe Impasse  Companies that do business in Europe slipped after
coalition talks in Greece reached an impasse, raising concern
the country may not hold to the terms of its two bailouts
negotiated since May 2010. With parliament split and policy
makers in Berlin and Brussels urging Greece to stay the course,
the country at the epicenter of the debt crisis is again facing
the risk of an exit from the euro.  In France,  Francois Hollande  of the Socialist party
defeated  Nicolas Sarkozy  to become President. His victory may
sharpen tensions with key allies with Hollande advocating a more
aggressive European Central Bank role.  Hutchison Whampoa dropped 5.6 percent to HK$71.55.  HSBC
Holdings Plc (5) , Europe’s largest bank, fell 3.3 percent to
HK$68.40.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a Japanese camera maker that gets about 31
percent of sales from Europe, dropped 3.8 percent to 3,465 yen
in Tokyo.  Sony Corp. fell 11 percent to 1,135 yen, the lowest in more
than 31 years, after forecasting a profit that lagged behind
analyst estimates amid slumping sales of its televisions and
PlayStation 3 game consoles.  Minerals, Ships, Games  Iluka Resources Ltd. (ILU)  slumped 20 percent to A$13.36 in
Sydney after the world’s largest zircon producer cut its
forecast for output of the mineral.  Cosco Corp. Singapore Ltd. (COS) 
fell 10 percent to S$0.93 after the unit of China’s biggest
shipping company posted first-quarter earnings that missed
estimates.  Namco Bandai Holdings Inc. (7832)  sank 14 percent to 975 yen
in Tokyo after the operator of arcades and theme parks forecast
a 9.3 percent drop in profit for the year ending March 31.  Of the 544 companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index that
have posted  quarterly results  since April 10, 206 exceeded
expectations, while 209 missed analysts’ estimates, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg News.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , Asia’s biggest carmaker, recouped
losses of as much as 3 percent earlier in the week to end the
week 0.9 percent higher at 3,235 yen after forecasting profit
will more than double to a five-year high.  Volatility rose as stocks retreated. The  HSI Volatility
Index (VHSI) , a measure of options prices on the  Hang Seng , gained 24
percent to 23.290. The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index
gained 15 percent to 22.71.  To contact the reporter on this story:
