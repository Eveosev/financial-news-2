Saudi private petrochemical makers
may pay more for their feedstock due to high oil prices,  Al
Rajhi Capital , the investment arm of the kingdom’s biggest bank
by market value, said.  Saudi Arabian Oil Co., also known as  Saudi Aramco , is
allocating feedstock, mainly propane, to new petrochemical
plants at a 27 percent discount to international naphtha prices,
 Al Rajhi  said in an e-mailed report today.  This will make private companies like  Sahara Petrochemical
Co. (SPC)  and  Advanced Petrochemical Co. (APPC)  more exposed to risks from
higher feedstock costs “in case of an up-tick in naphtha
prices,” than government-owned companies like  Saudi Arabian
Fertilizer Co. (SAFCO)  that receive most of their feedstock “at a fixed
price of 75 cents per million British Thermal Unit,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
