Real Madrid is prepared to offer 15
million pounds ($24 million) for Chelsea defender Branislav
Ivanovic, the Daily Mail said.  Real wants to strengthen its defense and manager Jose
Mourinho favors Ivanovic, who excelled in Chelsea’s Champions
League semifinal win over Barcelona, the Mail said. Ivanovic,
28, joined Chelsea for 9.7 million pounds in 2008 from Lokomotiv
Moscow.  Mourinho also wants another defender to replace veteran
 Ricardo Carvalho  and has considered Arsenal’s Thomas Vermaelen,
the Mail said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
