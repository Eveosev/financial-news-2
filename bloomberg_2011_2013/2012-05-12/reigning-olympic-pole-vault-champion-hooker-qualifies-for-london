Steve Hooker, the Olympic champion
pole vaulter from  Australia , qualified to defend his gold medal
in  London  after overcoming a loss of confidence that saw him
take a three-month break from competitions.  Hooker  cleared  the 5.72 meter (18.8 feet) qualifying height
on his second attempt at a meet in Perth yesterday. He will
defend the title he secured in Beijing with an Olympic record
5.96 meter leap, winning him Australia’s only athletics gold at
the tournament.  “For a while there I thought I was a shoe-in to make
London and losing that certainty and having to fight like I have
to get back was a challenge I didn’t see coming,” Hooker said
on Athletics Australia’s website. “It has been months and
months of jumps, jumps and more jumps - thousands of jumps
seriously - to be back at this level.”  Hooker’s international titles include the 2009 world
championship, the 2006 and 2010 Commonwealth Games gold medals,
the 2010 world indoor championship and a 6.06 meter Australian
and Oceania record, according to Athletics Australia.  He decided not to compete in the Australian domestic
athletics season because his “auto pilot” wasn’t working,
Hooker  wrote  in the  Daily Telegraph  in February.  “The confidence I require to stand at the end of the
runway and then charge down, land my pole and soar almost six
meters into the air has left me for the time being,” he said at
the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
