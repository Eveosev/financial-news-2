Raul Ibanez hit a three-run homer in
the sixth inning to give the  New York  Yankees the lead in their
6-2 Major League Baseball victory over the  Seattle Mariners .  Dustin Ackley led off the first inning with a solo home run
for the Mariners last night at Yankee Stadium. Robinson Cano hit
a run-scoring single in the bottom of the inning to tie the game
at 1-1.  Jesus Montero hit a home run in the sixth to put the
Mariners (15-19) ahead 2-1 before Ibanez knocked in three runs
in the bottom of the inning. Andruw Jones sealed the win for the
Yankees (18-14) with a two-run homer in the eighth.  “Raul’s a selective hitter,” Yankees manager  Joe Girardi 
told reporters. “But it was smart. He jumped on him.”  Hiroki Kuroda (3-4) allowed two runs on six hits while
striking out two in seven innings for the win.  “He gave us an outstanding performance tonight,” Girardi
said of Kuroda, who is 3-1 at home.  Felix Hernandez  (3-2) gave up 11 hits and four runs and
struck out seven in 6 2/3 innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
