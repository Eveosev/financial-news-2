The European Union must implement
measures both to consolidate public finance and boost economic
growth, the bloc’s Economic and Monetary commissioner Olli Rehn
said at a conference today in the Estonian capital, Tallinn.  “The debate on consolidation versus growth is a false
debate,” Rehn said. “We need to stay on course with regards to
fiscal consolidation and we need actions to boost growth.”  EU member states need to pursue structural reforms and lure
more public and private investment to overcome the crisis, Rehn
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
