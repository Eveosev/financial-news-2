Miami Heat  forward  LeBron James  won
the National Basketball Association’s Most Valuable Player award
for the third time.  James, 27, finished third in the NBA in scoring this season
with an average of 27.1 points per game, and was fourth in
steals and 13th in assists.  “Less than 10 years ago I had dreams of being in the NBA
and putting on an NBA uniform,” the nine-year veteran said at a
news conference broadcast on the league’s website. “I never
dreamt about being an NBA Most Valuable Player. It’s
overwhelming.”  James won his first two MVP awards with the Cleveland
Cavaliers before moving to the Heat as a free agent for the
2010-11 season. He’s the eighth player to receive the honor at
least three times.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
