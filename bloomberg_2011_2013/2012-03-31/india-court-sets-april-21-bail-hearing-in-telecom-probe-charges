An Indian court will consider bail
applications for four company officials on April 21 as it probes
charges linked to the 2008 sale of mobile-phone licenses that
sparked the country’s biggest graft investigation.  Judge O.P. Saini today set the date for bail hearings for
 Essar Group  employees Anshuman Ruia and Ravi Ruia, and Loop
Telecom Ltd.’s Kiran Khaitan and her husband I.P. Khaitan. Today
was the first time the four appeared in court to face the
charges.  Former Telecommunications Minister  Andimuthu Raja ,
officials and business executives are accused of conspiring to
award permits to ineligible companies in the 2008 sale. Their
actions might have cost the country $31 billion in revenue,
according to a report by  India ’s chief auditor.  All of the accused have denied the charges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
