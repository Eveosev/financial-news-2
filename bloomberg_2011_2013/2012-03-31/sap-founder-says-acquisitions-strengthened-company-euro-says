SAP AG (SAP)  founder Dietmar Hopp won’t
sell the stakes he or his foundation owns in the company,  Euro
am Sonntag  said, citing an interview with Hopp. Current co-Chief
Executive Officers Jim Hagemann Snabe and  Bill McDermott  are
acting very skilfully, especially when doing acquisitions, and
have helped the company reach an outstanding position for the
future, the paper said, citing Hopp. SAP is the world’s biggest
maker of enterprise-management software.  To contact the reporter on this story:
