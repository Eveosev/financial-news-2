Jeremy Lin, the undrafted point
guard from  Harvard University  who came off the bench to
revitalize the  New York Knicks  in February, will miss the rest
of the regular season after knee surgery.  Lin, 23, will have arthroscopic surgery on a small chronic
meniscal tear in his left knee that was revealed by an MRI
earlier this week, team spokesman Jonathan Supranowitz said in
an e-mail. He will miss about six weeks.  Surgery has been scheduled although the team hasn’t
disclosed the date, Supranowitz said.  Lin, who was cut by two other teams before joining the
Knicks, averaged 14.6 points and 6.1 assists since getting his
first shot at extended playing time on Feb. 4 when he came off
the bench to help spark a New York win.  The Knicks, who host the Cleveland Cavaliers tonight at
Madison Square Garden, have four weeks left in the regular
season. Their final game comes April 26 against the  Charlotte
Bobcats .  New York (26-26) holds the eighth and final playoff spot
in the  National Basketball Association ’s Eastern Conference, 15½
games behind the Chicago Bulls and 1½ games ahead of the
Milwaukee Bucks, who host the Memphis Grizzlies tonight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
