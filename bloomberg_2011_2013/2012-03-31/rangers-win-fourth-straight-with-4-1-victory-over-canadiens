Michael Del Zotto scored two goals
for the National Hockey League-leading  New York  Rangers, who won
their fourth straight game with a 4-1 victory over the  Montreal
Canadiens .  The Rangers (50-21-7) have 107 points, one point ahead of
the St. Louis Blues in the league, 13 points over the second-
seeded  Boston Bruins  in the Eastern Conference and five points
over the  Pittsburgh Penguins  in the Atlantic Division.  “I think we’ve handled ourselves well in the last four, at
working at our game and the number of people who contributed,”
Rangers coach John Tortorella said.  Marian Gaborik gave the Rangers a 1-0 lead with his 39th
goal of the season in the first period at New York’s Madison
Square Garden. Brad Richards added a power-play goal in the
second period for a 2-0 advantage.  Del Zotto scored a power-play goal eight minutes into the
third period, and added a second one eight minutes later to give
the Rangers a 4-0 lead. Rene Bourque scored with less than three
minutes left in the game to give the Canadiens their only goal.  The Canadiens (29-35-14), with 72 points in the Eastern
Conference, have been eliminated from playoff contention.  To contact the reporter on this story:
