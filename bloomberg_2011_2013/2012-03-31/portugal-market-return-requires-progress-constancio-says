Portugal’s return to bond markets
depends on the country’s ability to meet targets as part of its
external aid program and market perception, said  European
Central Bank ’s Vice President  Vitor Constancio .  The question of whether Portugal can sell debt or needs
additional aid from international creditors “only poses itself
in September next year,” Constancio, who is Portuguese, told
reporters in Copenhagen today after a meeting of European
finance ministers. “Until then, we have to see if this progress
consolidates, allowing the return to the markets without a new
program.” Meanwhile, “fortunately” market conditions have
improved for the country, he said.  Portugal’s aid plan assumes the country will regain access
to medium and long-term sovereign debt markets in 2013, with the
program’s last disbursement to be made in June 2014, the
 International Monetary Fund  said in December. European leaders
declared then that  Greece ’s situation is “exceptional and
unique” and said they don’t foresee bondholder losses in other
nations that seek assistance.  Portugal’s Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho has said the
country will not ask for more money or more time to fulfill the
program, but that if his country is unable to return to markets
as planned due to “external reasons,” it would be able to
count on continued support from the IMF, the European Commission
and the ECB.  To contact the reporter on this story:
