Monterosso won the $10 million
Dubai  World Cup , the world’s richest horse race.  Monterosso, ridden by Mickael Barzalona with 20-1 odds, won
the 1 1/4-mile race at Meydan Race Course in 2 minutes, 02.67
seconds. Monterosso finished third in last year’s race.  “I couldn’t believe it when no one was coming after me (in
the straight),” Barzalona told reporters. “This is a dream. I
have no words to describe what I feel right now.”  Capponi, at 11-1, was second, with 14-1 Planteur third and
So You Think, the 11-8 favorite, fourth.  Game On Dude, with jockey Chantal Sutherland, the first
woman to ride in the race, finished near the back of the pack.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
