President  Robert Mugabe  said
Zimbabwe should hold a referendum to decide a new constitution
in May, the state-controlled  Herald  said, citing him.  Mugabe, 88, said the “dance was over” and that the four-
year power-sharing agreement between his Zimbabwe African
National Union-Patriotic Front and the Movement for Democratic
Change should end, the Herald reported. Mugabe was speaking to
members of his own party, the newspaper added.  Mugabe’s Zanu-PF party shares power with the MDC, led by
Prime Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai , after the  Southern African
Development Community  said elections in 2008 didn’t meet
regional standards of fairness.  A SADC-brokered agreement between the two rival parties led
to a power-sharing agreement that may see presidential and
parliamentary elections held either this year or next.  To contact the reporter on this story:
