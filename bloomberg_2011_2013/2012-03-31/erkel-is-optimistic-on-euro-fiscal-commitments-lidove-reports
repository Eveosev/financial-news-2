German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  is
optimistic that all euro-area members will honor their budget
commitments,  Lidove Noviny  reported, citing an interview.  Greece has a difficult path ahead, though the country has
come quite a long way with “tough” measures to increase its
competitiveness, the Czech newspaper cited Merkel as saying. The
euro area is moving toward a political union, and  Europe  needs
to overhaul labor laws and boost spending on science and
research to achieve sustainable growth, Merkel said, according
to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
