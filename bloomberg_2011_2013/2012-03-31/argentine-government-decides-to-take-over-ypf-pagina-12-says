Argentina ’s government has decided
to take over  YPF SA (YPFD)  and is debating whether to expropriate the
 oil company  or buy a stake and control its management,  Pagina 12 
reported, citing officials it didn’t identify.  Whichever solution is chosen, the government will need the
approval of Congress, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper said.  The government has been angered by YPF’s policy of paying
out all its profits in dividends, at a time when the state is
looking to boost investment and lift oil production, Pagina 12
said. The oil company’s largest shareholder is  Spain ’s Repsol
YPF SA with 57 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
