Roche Holding AG (ROG) , which on March 29
raised its hostile bid for  Illumina Inc. (ILMN) , is in talks with hedge
funds that bought Illumina stock following news of the takeover
attempt,  Finanz & Wirtschaft  reported, without saying where it
got the information.  Roche, a Basel, Switzerland-based drugmaker, increased its
offer to $51 a share after Illumina shareholders told Roche they
were interested in accelerating the takeover process, the Swiss
newspaper quoted Roche Chief Executive Officer Severin Schwan as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
