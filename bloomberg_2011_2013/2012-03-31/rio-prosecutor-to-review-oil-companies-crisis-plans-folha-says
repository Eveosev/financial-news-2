A federal prosecutor in Rio de
Janeiro wants  oil companies  operating in Brazil’s Campos Basin,
including  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , to present their emergency
plans for review, Folha de S. Paulo reported.  Prosecutor Eduardo Santos said the companies should prove
that they are able to respond in the event of a crisis, the Sao
Paulo-based newspaper said, citing an interview. Brazil’s oil
regulator, known as ANP, isn’t able to supervise operations at
Campos after a recent leak by  Chevron Corp. (CVX) , Folha reported,
citing Santos.  Calls to the federal prosecutor’s office today by Bloomberg
News went unanswered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
