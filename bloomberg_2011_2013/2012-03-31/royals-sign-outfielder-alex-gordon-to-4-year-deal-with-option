Outfielder Alex Gordon agreed to a
contract with the Royals that could keep the Gold Glove winner
in  Kansas City  through the 2016 season, the team said.  Gordon, 28, who began his Major League Baseball career as a
third baseman before switching to left field last season, led
all outfielders with 20 assists last year.  Gordon, who has spent all five of his major league seasons
with the Royals, hit a career-best .303 last year with 23 home
runs and 87 runs batted in.  The Royals said yesterday that Gordonâ€™s new contract
includes four guaranteed years and a player option for the 2016
season. Financial terms were not disclosed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
