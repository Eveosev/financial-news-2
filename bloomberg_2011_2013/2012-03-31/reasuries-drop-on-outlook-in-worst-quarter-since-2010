Treasuries had their worst quarter
since the last three months of 2010 while corporate bonds surged
as the world’s largest economy showed signs of improvement.  U.S. government securities lost 1 percent from the start of
the year to March 29, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes
show. An index of investment-grade and high-yield corporate
bonds returned 3.2 percent, the most since the third quarter of
2010. Treasuries also trailed German debt, while stocks surged.
U.S. payrolls added more than 200,000 jobs for a fourth month in
March, the longest such run since 2000, data next week may show.  “Our economy is gaining traction,” said  Thomas Roth ,
senior Treasury trader in  New York  at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities
USA Inc. “If you think things are getting better, you’re not
supposed to buy 10-year notes with 2 percent yields.”  Benchmark  10-year note  yields climbed 33 basis points, or
0.33 percentage point, from the end of 2011 to 2.21 percent
yesterday in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader
prices. They reached 2.40 percent on March 20, the highest level
since Oct. 28, a week after the  Federal Reserve  upgraded its
assessment of the U.S. economy. They had touched a record low
1.67 percent in September. The average over the past decade is
3.86 percent.  Ten-year yields will increase to 2.54 percent by year-end,
according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
77 financial companies, with the most recent projections given
the heaviest weightings.  Thirty-year bond  yields rose 44 basis points from January
through March to 3.34 percent.  Risk Appetite  Stocks rallied as data showing U.S. economic improvement
fueled risk appetite. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index had its
biggest first-quarter advance since 1998, gaining 12 percent.  The U.S. economy grew at a 3 percent annual rate in the
last three months of 2011, the same as previously estimated,
revised figures from the Commerce Department showed on March 29.
It gained at a 1.8 percent pace in the prior quarter.  Consumer
spending  rose by 0.8 percent in February, the most in seven
months, Commerce Department data showed yesterday.  “The U.S. has got some legs, at least for the next couple
of quarters,”  Jim O’Neill , chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset
Management, said yesterday in an interview on Bloomberg
Television in  Italy . “There remain all sorts of issues, but I
think the U.S. is going to continue to positively surprise.”  Employment Report  Employers in the U.S. added 205,000 jobs in March,
economists in a Bloomberg News survey forecast before the Labor
Department reports the data on April 6. The monthly increase was
last below 200,000 in November. It would be the longest stretch
above that figure since the five months ended in January 2000.  Treasuries (YCGT0025)  fell this month as  Greece  pushed through the
biggest sovereign restructuring in history after getting private
investors to forgive more than 100 billion euros ($132 billion)
of debt. The move opened the way for a 130 billion-euro bailout
package designed to prevent a collapse of the economy.  “Part of the reason yields went up was the better economic
numbers,”  Maury Harris , chief economist at UBS AG in New York,
one of the 21 primary dealers that trade directly with the Fed,
said March 28. “But an important part of that was” a decline
in the “risk coming out of  Europe  with the progress that you’ve
seen there.”  German (GDBR10)  10-year bunds were little changed this quarter as
their haven appeal waned, with yields falling four basis points
to 1.79 percent. Treasuries still lagged behind German sovereign
debt, which returned 0.2 percent from January through March.  Real Yield  The increase in U.S. yields this year has brought them
closer to the annual rate of inflation. Ten-year notes have a
so-called real yield of minus 66 basis points, compared with
minus 152 basis points at the end of 2011.  The five-year, five-year  forward break-even  rate, which
projects the pace of consumer-price increases starting in 2017,
was 2.66 percent on March 28 after reaching 2.78 percent on
March 19, the highest level since August.  While the measure, which the Fed prefers to look at in
determining inflation expectations and monetary policy, is up
from this year’s low of 2.37 percent on March 5, it’s below the
2.72 percent average over the past decade.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said this week the economic
recovery isn’t assured. Policy makers don’t rule out further
options to support growth, he said on March 27, according to a
transcript of an ABC News interview provided by the network.  Quantitative Easing  The central bank bought $2.3 trillion of debt under two
rounds of quantitative easing from December 2008 to June 2011 to
support the economy. It also has kept the benchmark  interest
rate  for overnight loans between banks at zero to 0.25 percent
since December 2008 and has pledged to keep it there through
most of 2014.  Philadelphia Fed President  Charles Plosser  said March 29
the central bank may need to raise  interest rates  before late
2014 and additional stimulus isn’t necessary as the  U.S. economy 
shows signs of strength.  “A lot of people were quick to embrace” the changes
suggested by U.S. yields’ climb from March 13 through March 20,
 Scott Sherman , an interest-rate strategist at the primary dealer
Credit Suisse Group AG in New York, said yesterday. “They
priced out expectations for additional asset purchases. They
also priced forward earlier rate increases.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
