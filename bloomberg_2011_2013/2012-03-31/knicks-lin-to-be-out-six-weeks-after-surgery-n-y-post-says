Jeremy Lin, the undrafted point
guard who came off the bench and helped set the  New York Knicks 
on a winning streak, will be out six weeks after surgery on his
left knee, the New York Post said, citing the team.  Lin is scheduled for arthroscopic surgery tomorrow, the
Post said.  “It sucks, but when I come back I’ll be stronger than I’ll
ever be,” Lin told the Post before tonight’s game against the
 Cleveland Cavaliers .  Lin has missed the Knicks’ games since March 26. The
Harvard University graduate is averaging 14.6 points and 6.1
assists during this National Basketball Association season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
