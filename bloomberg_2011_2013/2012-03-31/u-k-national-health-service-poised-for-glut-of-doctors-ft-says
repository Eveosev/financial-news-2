The U.K.â€™s  National Health Service 
will have an oversupply of as many as 20,000 doctors by the end
of the decade, pressuring medical professionals to accept lower-
paid roles or seek work abroad, the  Financial Times  said.  The number of medical students and junior doctors
qualifying as consultants will increase to 60,000 by 2020 from
40,000 today, the newspaper said, citing a report published by
the Centre for Workforce Intelligence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
