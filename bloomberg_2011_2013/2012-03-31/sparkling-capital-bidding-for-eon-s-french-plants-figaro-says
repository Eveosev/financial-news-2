Sparkling Capital is bidding for
four of  EON AG (EOAN) ’s French coal-fired power plants,  Le Figaro 
reported, without saying where it obtained the information.  Sparkling Capital, a mid-sized company with headquarters in
Paris and Hong Kong, pledged to maintain the jobs of all 365
employees at the plants, Le Figaro reported today.  Electricite
de France SA (EDF)  backs Sparkling Capital’s offer, which was
submitted yesterday to EON managers, according to the daily.  Dusseldorf-based EON said June 9 it was planning to close
five French coal-fired power plants as they wouldn’t meet
environmental standards and would be too costly to run. EON will
keep the remaining plant, Le Figaro reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
