World No. 1 Yani Tseng moved into
first place from third, taking a one-stroke lead over Haeji Kang
into the third round of the Kraft Nabisco Championship, the
first major tournament on golf’s LPGA Tour.  Tseng shot her second straight 68 yesterday on the Dinah
Shore Course at Mission Hills Country Club in Rancho Mirage,
 California . Tseng, who won the title in 2010 and was runner-up
to Stacy Lewis of the U.S. last year, finished the second round
at 8-under 136.  Tseng, 23, is the youngest golfer of either gender to claim
five major championships. The Taiwanese player has won two
straight tournaments and three of the first five on the tour
this year.  “You never get tired when you want to win a tournament,”
Tseng told reporters. “I just figured out I’m tired after the
last two wins when you come into this week, but after (Thursday),
I had a good sleep, and I relaxed a few days, and I think I’m
coming back with a fresh focus.”  Kang also had a 68 yesterday to hold second place and
Australian Lindsey Wright and  South Korea ’s Sun Young Yoo share
the third spot at 6-under 138.  Se Ri Pak of South Korea, Na Yeon Choi and Karin Sjodin
were three strokes off the lead at 139.  First-round leader Amy Yang of South Korea shot a 74
yesterday to fall to 4-under 140. Lewis, who last year became
the fourth golfer to make the Kraft Nabisco her first title on
the tour, was at 1 over.  To contact the reporter on this story:
