Saudi Arabian shares rose to the
highest level in more than 3 1/2 years as a positive outlook for
earnings and oil prices lifted banks and petrochemical
companies.  The  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  climbed 0.7 percent to 7,835.15
at 3:30 p.m. in Riyadh, and earlier today touched 7,852.85, the
highest level since Sept. 13, 2008. The 152-member index has
gained 22 percent this year.  Samba Financial Group (BSFR)  rose to the highest level in almost a
year.  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the world’s largest
petrochemical company known as Sabic, advanced 0.5 percent,
while Yanbu National Petrochemical Co., a  Sabic unit , jumped 2
percent.  “In terms of fundamentals, the market looks pretty
reasonable,” Jarmo Kotilaine, chief economist at Jeddah-based
National Commercial Bank, said in a phone interview. “The
earnings outlook is good. Oil prices are high. There are a
number of factors that have made equities the flavor of the
month.”  Crude oil for May delivery settled at $103.02 a barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday.  Oil prices  increased
4.2 percent for the quarter after a gain of 25 percent in the
last quarter of 2011.  Saudi companies will report first-quarter financial results
in April. The banks’ cumulative profits jumped 36 percent in the
first two months of this year to 6.74 billion riyals ($1.8
billion), data on the central bank’s website showed.  Samba Financial Group (SAMBA)  increased 1.3 percent to 56.75
riyals, the highest price since April 11. Banque Saudi Fransi
rose 0.8 percent to 49.60 riyals. Sabic shares advanced 0.5
percent to 108 riyals, while Yanbu National gained 2 percent to
52 riyals.  Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is the only Gulf Arab bourse
that opens on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
