Subscribers of  Iliad SA (ILD) ’s Free
mobile-phone service have trouble making primetime calls, Le
Parisien  reported , citing a survey.  Forty-six percent of the calls made by Free clients in
Paris and Lyon between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. don’t go through,
reported the newspaper, citing measurements by Paris-based
Directique. During the rest of the day, Free’s failure rate is
14 percent, Le Parisien said. That compares with a failure rate
of just 1 percent all day long for subscribers of  France Telecom
SA (FTE) ’s Orange SA, Bouygues Telecom and  Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s SFR, the
Directique survey showed, according to Le Parisien.  To contact the reporter on this story:
