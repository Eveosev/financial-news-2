Canada ’s dollar rose for a second
quarter versus its U.S. counterpart as the outlook for the
American economy improved and speculation the euro-zone debt
crisis may be easing lifted demand for higher-risk currencies.  The currency traded as low as C$1.0319 in early January
before rallying to 98.42 cents per U.S. dollar this month as the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained. Optimism over accelerating
global growth bolstered demand for Canada’s  raw materials , which
account for about half of export revenue. Bank of Canada
Governor  Mark Carney  speaks in Waterloo, Ontario, on April 2.  “Better U.S. data is constructive for Canada,” Brian Kim,
a currency strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc’s RBS
Securities unit in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , wrote in an e-mail.
“The reduced uncertainty on  Europe  and the global outlook have
helped pare Bank of Canada rate-easing expectations for 2012,
which helped the Canadian dollar.”  The loonie, nicknamed for the image of the aquatic bird on
the C$1 coin, rose 2.4 percent in the quarter to 99.87 cents
against the U.S. dollar yesterday in Toronto. One Canadian
dollar purchased $1.0013. It ended last year at C$1.0213.  Stocks rallied on prospects for accelerating global growth
as  Greece  won a second international bailout and bond spreads in
Italy and  Spain  narrowed, sending volatility measures to almost
record lows. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 12 percent
this quarter, after an 11 percent gain in the last three months
of 2011.  The correlation coefficient between the loonie and the  S&P
500  was 0.75 yesterday, versus 0.45 for oil, 0.64 for copper and
0.55 for the U.S.-Canada two-year yield spread, 30-day
correlation data show. A coefficient of 1 means the measures
move in lockstep.  ‘Brighter Prospects’  “I attribute the Canadian dollar doing better to the
equity rally and the brighter prospects for the  U.S. economy ,”
 Steve Butler , managing director in Toronto at  Bank of Nova
Scotia (BNS) ’s Scotia Capital unit, wrote in an e-mail. “The Canadian
dollar has decent fundamentals but the data of late has been
disappointing. The Bank of Canada is clearly on hold.”  The loonie dropped 0.2 percent over the past three months,
the fourth-worst performer after losses of 1.2 percent by the
Australian dollar, 2.7 percent by the U.S. dollar and the yen’s
10 percent drop, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Currency Indexes, a gauge of 10 developed-nation currencies. The
 New Zealand dollar  and Norwegian krone were the two biggest
gainers.  Government bonds  fell this quarter, pushing the yield on
the benchmark  10-year note  higher by 17 basis points, or 0.17
percentage point, to 2.11 percent. The yield reached 2.297
percent on March 19, the highest since October. It was as low
this quarter as 1.887 percent in January.  Since the 1950s  Yields on Canada’s  two-year note  rose 24 basis points to
1.20 percent, as traders speculated the central bank was moving
further from raising rates.  The Bank of Canada has held its target  lending rate  at 1
percent since September 2010 in the longest pause since the
1950s. Borrowing costs aren’t forecast to advance until the
first quarter of 2013, according to economists in a Bloomberg
News survey.  Investors bet on 2.2 basis points of tightening by the Bank
of Canada’s rate decision in September, according to Bloomberg
calculations derived from overnight  index (SPX)  swaps as of yesterday.
That compares with minus 15.77 at the end of last year, the data
show.  The yield on the September 2012 bankers’ acceptances
contract, a barometer of short-term rate projections, rose to
1.3 percent yesterday, from 1.12 at the end of last year,
indicating traders are increasing expectations for policy makers
to raise rates.  ‘Pretty Contained’  Kim predicts the Canadian dollar will appreciate to 96
cents versus the greenback by the end of June. Scotia Bank sees
it weakening to C$1.01, which matches the average forecast of 37
economists and analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.  “We’ve been pretty contained,” Matthew Perrier, Toronto-
based director of foreign exchange at  Bank of Montreal (BMO) , said in
a telephone interview, citing the nine-week range of 98.42 cents
to C$1.0071. “Even if we do get a break through C$1.0075, I
don’t think it’ll go screaming too much higher given the pent-up
interest to sell U.S. dollars at better levels.”  He predicted the currency will trade between 99 cents and
C$1.0125 next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
