The euro area remains the biggest
threat to global growth as imbalances still need to be
addressed,  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
Chief Economist Pier Carlo Padoan said.  “The weaknesses of the euro area are still a source of
concern,” Padoan said in a Bloomberg Television interview today
in Cernobbio,  Italy . “We can have a way out in  Europe  having
reforms taking place not only in the debt countries but in all
of the countries, including Germany, which should invest and
open more.”  European finance ministers agreed yesterday in Copenhagen
to boost a firewall against the region’s debt crisis by 500
billion euros ($667 billion) on top of the 300 billion euros
already committed. Europe is counting on those funds, plus the
 European Central Bank ’s extra lending and bond-buying programs.  The decision to increase the firewall “provides time, but
more needs to be done, especially by governments in sensitive
countries, to carry on the reform programs,” Padoan said.  Fiscal convergence, euro bonds, as well as common fiscal
rules are among measures that the region should adopt, Padoan
said.  Germany  would benefit from liberalization of its services
sector, Padoan said, adding that the country should increase
investment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
