A delegation from the Syrian
National Coordination Committee plans to visit Moscow “mid-
April” for talks with Russian Foreign Minister  Sergei Lavrov ,
the opposition bloc’s Hassan Abdel-Azim said.  The visit, initially scheduled for Feb. 6, was postponed
after  Russia ’s envoy to  Syria  said an informal meeting between
representatives of the committee and Syrian authorities was
planned in Moscow, Azim said.  “We will refuse such contacts until the authorities stop
using violence,” he said today in an interview with the Voice
of Russia radio station.  The committee supports UN envoy Kofi Annan’s efforts and is
ready to cooperate with international observers in Syria, Azim
said, adding that the committee is demanding the release of all
political prisoners in the country.  The committee wasn’t invited to the Friends of Syria Group
meeting in Istanbul tomorrow, Azim said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
