J&D’s Foods, the Seattle-based
maker of bacon salt and bacon mayonnaise, began to sell a $3,000
coffin to promote the flavor, the Financial Times said.  The steel casket draped in fabric imitating the look of the
fried pork meat will help sell J&D's Foods’ range of edible bacon
products, the newspaper said, citing an interview with co-
founder Justin Esch.  The coffin will also help to meet increasing demand for
customized caskets, the paper said, citing Mark Allen, the
former chief executive officer of the Casket and Funeral Supply
Association of America.  To contact the reporter on this story:
