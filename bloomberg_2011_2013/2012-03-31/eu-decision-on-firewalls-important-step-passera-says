The European Union’s decision on
so-called firewalls is a “very important step,” Italy’s
Economic Development Minister  Corrado Passera  said.  “The higher they are, the less likely the need to use
them,” Passera said of the firewalls today to reporters at a
conference in Cernobbio, Italy.  Euro-area ministers, meeting in Copenhagen yesterday, set
the maximum lending volume of the proposed European Stability
Mechanism at 500 billion euros ($667 billion). Agreement was
also reached on the combined lending ceiling of the ESM and the
temporary fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, at
700 billion euros.  This, in addition to the 102 billion euros already paid to
support current European rescue programs, brings the total size
of the firewall to 800 billion euros, the Eurogroup said
yesterday.  Passera also said that  Italy ’s government plans to create a
“more competitive market” in the gas sector, adding that
officials seek to “reach and exceed” the European Union target
on renewable energy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
