Rio de Janeiroâ€™s state
environmental institute identified a stain containing about
1,600 liters of oil 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) from the shore of
Arraial do Cabo, the agency known as  INEA  said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The oil is most likely to have been leaked by a ship, INEA
said. The institute has asked the support of  Petroleo Brasileiro
SA (PETR4) , the state-controlled  oil company , to contain the stain and
keep it from reaching the beaches of the region, it said.  The stain was found earlier today by experts from INEA, the
agency said in the statement, adding that it will collect the
substance to try to identify the origin of the oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
