Total SA (FP)  may have underestimated
the risks from its Elgin platform in the U.K.  North Sea , which
has been leaking natural gas for a week, Le Monde  reported ,
citing an unidentified employee and a union representative.  During a meeting held on March 25, before the leak started,
Elgin site managers reassured employees concerned about the
unusually high pressure levels, a worker onsite that day told Le
Monde. Workers had been voicing their concern to managers for a
month, Le Monde added, citing Jake Molloy, a regional organizer
for the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers.  Total noticed unusual variations in pressure in the well
last month and began pumping mud down it March 4, Michel Hourcard, Total’s director of exploration, said yesterday.  “Total waited too long to kill the well,” Molloy told Le
Monde.  To contact the reporter on this story:
