Two people were killed and more
than 2,000 others fled their homes in Fiji after flash floods
hit the South Pacific island following days of heavy rains,
 Fijilive  reported, citing police.  Police found the body of a Fijian man after his vehicle was
swept away by strong currents yesterday in Nadi, the site of the
nationâ€™s international airport, the online newspaper reported on
its website. Another male body was retrieved from a river, it
said.  Fiji issued alerts for severe floods at major rivers,
streams and low-lying areas in the western division as heavy
rains and thunderstorms are forecast to continue, according to a
 statement  on the Fiji Meteorological Service website. A tropical
storm was located southwest of Nadi at 9 a.m. today and is
expected to gradually move away from Fiji, it said.  Fiji is a 332-island archipelago located in the South
 Pacific Ocean , 3,240 kilometers (2,013 miles) northeast of
 Australia . The cyclone season in the region runs from November
to April and storms sometimes cause flooding and landslides.  To contact the reporter on this story:
