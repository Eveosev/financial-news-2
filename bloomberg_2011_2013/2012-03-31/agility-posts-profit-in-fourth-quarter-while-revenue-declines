Agility Public Warehousing Co. (AGLTY) , the
Kuwaiti storage and logistics company, reported a fourth-quarter
profit of 3.5 million Kuwaiti dinars ($12.6 million), while
sales dropped.  Agility’s profit was 3.45 fils a share, compared with a
loss of 24.5 fils in the year-ago fourth quarter, according an
e-mailed statement from the company.  Revenue in the period fell 4.5 percent to 352 million
dinars from 368.6 million, mostly because of the loss of
government contracting business, the company said. Full-year
profit increased 8 percent.  “Having undergone some heavy lifting in terms of
restructuring over the last two years, the company anticipates
solid gains in 2012 and beyond,,” Chairman Tarek Sultan Al-Essa
said in the statement.  The European Union fined two of Agility’s units 4.96
million euros ($6.62 million) this week for breaking laws on
competition in the freight-forwarding market, according to a
March 29 company statement to the Kuwaiti bourse.  Agility asked a U.S. judge on Feb. 21 to dismiss charges
that it defrauded the U.S. government on a multibillion-dollar
contract to feed troops overseas, saying prosecutors have no
proof.  To contact the reporter on this story:
