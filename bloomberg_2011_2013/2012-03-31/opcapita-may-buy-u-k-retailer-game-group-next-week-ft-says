OpCapita LLP, a private equity
firm, may buy computer games retailer  Game Group Plc (GMG) â€™s U.K.
operations as early as next week, the Financial Times said,
citing three people familiar with the situation.  OpCapita faces competition to rescue Game, which is under
judicial administration, from a group including Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc and Barlcays Plc, which is considering a
debt-for-equity swap, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
