Drydocks World LLC, which owns the
 Middle East ’s biggest shipyard in Dubai, said it secured
necessary support from lenders to “rapidly” restructure $2.2
billion in debt.  A “small minority” of lenders have yet to confirm their
support, the company said in a statement today.  Drydocks plans to repay creditors over five years as part
of a debt-restructuring program it submitted March 8. The
company is one of several in Dubai seeking to reorganize debt
after property prices and asset values slumped in the Persian
Gulf business hub and credit markets froze with the onset of the
2008 global credit crisis.  Drydocks borrowed $2.2 billion for two acquisitions in
 Singapore  in 2008 to gain ships and Asian shipbuilding sites.  To contact the reporter on this story:
