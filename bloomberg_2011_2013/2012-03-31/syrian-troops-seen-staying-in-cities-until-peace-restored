Syrian troops will remain in the
cities until peace and security and normal life are restored,
the official Syrian Arab News Agency said, citing an interview
with Jihad Maqdisi, Foreign Ministry spokesman, aired on Syrian
Satellite TV yesterday.  The presence of Syrian troops in cities is for defensive
purposes to protect civilians, Maqdisi was cited as saying by
the news service.  For Related News and Information:
