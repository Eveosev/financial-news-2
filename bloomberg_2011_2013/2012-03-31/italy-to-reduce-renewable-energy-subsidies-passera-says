Italy  will reduce subsidies for the
renewable-energy industry to match levels in the rest of  Europe ,
Economic Development Minister  Corrado Passera  said.  The incentives have produced “excessive” investment in
solar and wind power, distorting prices, Passera told reporters
today in Cernobbio, Italy.  The government plans to exceed European targets on
renewable usage without over-relying on taxpayers, Passera said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
