Tiscali SpA (TIS) , an Italian phone and
Internet company, reported a 2011 net loss as it had writedowns
for unpaid bills from customers.  The loss of 38.1 million euros ($51 million) compares with
a loss of 24.3 million euros in the year-earlier period, the
Cagliari-based company said in a statement late yesterday.  Tiscali forecast a return to profit in 2012, with revenue
expected to be in line with 2011 results.  To contact the reporters on this story:
