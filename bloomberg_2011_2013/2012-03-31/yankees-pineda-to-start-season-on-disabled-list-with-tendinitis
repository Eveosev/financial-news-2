New York  Yankees pitcher Michael
Pineda will start the season on the 15-day disabled list with
tendinitis in his right shoulder, the Major League Baseball
team’s website said.  Pineda, a 23-year-old right-hander, allowed 6 runs in 2 1/3
innings in a spring training start against the  Philadelphia
Phillies  last night and underwent an MRI exam today.  “It just needs a little rest,” Yankees manager  Joe
Girardi  said on the team’s website. “He’ll get treatment and
then we’ll see how long until he picks up a ball. We’ll be a
little conservative.”  Pineda was 9-10 with a 3.74 earned run average in 28 statrs
as a rookie with the  Seattle Mariners  last season. He was traded
to New York in January. The Yankees open their season April 6 at
 Tampa Bay .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
