Vietnam is demanding that  China 
halt the organization of a sailboat race to the disputed Paracel
Islands, according to a statement on the government’s website
posted today.  The race violates Vietnam’s sovereignty and goes against
China’s commitment to not take action that would “further
complicate” the situation in the  South China Sea , Luong Thanh
Nghi, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said in the statement.  The island chain in the South China Sea is fully controlled
by China, which ousted fellow claimant Vietnam from the 30
islets and reefs in a 1974 battle in which 71 soldiers were
killed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
