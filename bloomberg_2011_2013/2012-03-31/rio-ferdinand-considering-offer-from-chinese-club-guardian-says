Manchester United defender Rio
Ferdinand is considering an offer to play in  China  when his
contract ends after next season, the Guardian said.  A move to China may prove lucrative for Ferdinand.  Nicolas
Anelka  went from Chelsea to Shenghai Shenhua in January for a
salary of about 175,000 pounds ($280,000) per week. Shenhua is
not the club interested in Ferdinand, the Guardian said.  Ferdinand, 33, joined United from Leeds in 2002 and has
been hampered by injury the past few seasons. He’s started 21 of
United’s 30 Premier League games this season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
