The  Big East Conference  will
consider adding six schools to bring its football-playing
membership to 12, the Providence, Rhode Island-based conference
said Monday.  University presidents and chancellors authorized  Big East 
Commissioner John Marinatto to engage in formal discussion
during a conference call earlier in the day, Marinatto said in
an e-mailed statement.  The Big East has lost three schools in the past two months,
after Pittsburgh and Syracuse announced they were  leaving for
the Atlantic Coast Conference, and Texas Christian University,
which had committed to the league, began talks to join the Big
12 Conference.  The remaining football-playing schools in the Big East are
Rutgers, West Virginia, Cincinnati, Louisville, South Florida
and Connecticut.  Potential new members include Navy,  Air Force , Army,
Memphis, Central Florida, East Carolina, Temple and Villanova,
according to Walt Disney Co.â€™s ESPN.  To contact the reporter on this story:
