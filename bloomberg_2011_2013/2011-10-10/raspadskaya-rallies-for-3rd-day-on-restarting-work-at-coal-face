OAO  Raspadskaya (RASP)  gained for a third
day after the coal producer said on Oct. 7 it had started work
at a coal face with reserves of 1.4 million metric tons at its
flagship mine.  The shares leapt as much as 7.3 percent and last traded 2.4
percent higher at 83.95 rubles by 12:07 a.m. in Moscow.  Raspadskaya said two weeks ago that first-half profit fell
57 percent from a year earlier as output hadn’t recovered since
a series of explosions and fires at the Siberian mine that
killed 90 people.  “The news that the face has finally been commissioned is
positive,” Alfa Bank analysts led by Barry Ehrlich wrote in an
e-mailed report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
