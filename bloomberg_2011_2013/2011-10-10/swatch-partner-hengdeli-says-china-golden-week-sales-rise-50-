Hengdeli Holdings Ltd. (3389) , the retail
partner of  Swatch Group AG (UHR)  in  China , said sales for the first
three days of China’s weeklong holiday rose 50 percent.  “We saw a lot of customers snapping up the big-ticket
items earlier as they realize those are in limited supply,”
Stan Lee, a vice president at Hengdeli, said in a phone
interview today in Hong Kong. Products sold included Breguet,
Jaeger-LeCoultre, and A. Lange & Sohne watches priced at more
than HK$500,000 ($64,000), he said.  The distributor of Omega and Breguet brands operates more
than 300 stores in the mainland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, Lee
said. Hengdeli made 68 percent of last year’s sales in mainland
China, with 29 percent coming from  Hong Kong .  An average of 110,769 visitors from the mainland arrived in
Hong Kong each day from Oct. 1 to 7 during the week-long holiday
in China known as the Golden Week, according to government data.  Hengdeli fell 0.8 percent to HK$2.59 as of 10:25 a.m. in
Hong Kong trading and has lost 44 percent this year, compared
with a 24 percent decline for the benchmark Hang Seng Index.  Editors: Frank Longid  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
