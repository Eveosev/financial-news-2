The forint strengthened for a fourth
day and the koruna gained as Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s
election victory increased bets the region’s nations will be
able to sustain their public finances.  The currency of  Hungary , the most indebted eastern member
of the European Union at the end of 2010, appreciated 1.2
percent to 293.27 per euro by 5:06 p.m. in Budapest, the
strongest close since Sept. 29. The zloty gained 1.6 percent to
4.3104 and the Czech koruna rose 0.9 percent to 24.666.  Tusk’s ruling Civic Platform won 39.2 percent of the vote,
according to official results from 99.5 percent of precincts.
Tusk’s lead in election results spurred a rally in zloty bonds
on expectations his next administration will cut the  budget
deficit  he allowed to quadruple since 2007. Debt due on 2021
climbed for a fourth day, reducing the yield by nine basis
points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 5.67 percent.  “Yesterday’s Polish parliamentary vote should come as a
relief for the currency stories in the whole region, with
probably the most important message being a continuity in the
political backdrop,” Simon Quijano-Evans, a London-based
economist at ING Groep NV, wrote in a research report.  European stocks rallied and the euro surged after German
Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicholas Sarkozy
pledged to devise a plan in three weeks to stem the debt crisis.  “It’s good news in the region that the incumbent governing
parties in  Poland  ended the election with a good result,” Peter Karsai, a trader at Commerzbank AG in Budapest, and colleagues
wrote in an e-mail. “Yesterday’s meeting between the French
president and the German chancellor was also well received.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
