Swire Pacific Ltd. (19)  hired BOC
International Holdings Ltd., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC
Holdings Plc, and Morgan Stanley to help list its property unit
in December, two people with knowledge of the matter said.  The commercial landlord and owner of Hong Kong’s biggest
airline said in a Sept. 22 statement that it may seek to list
Swire Properties Ltd. without raising funds. The Hong Kong
listing may allow Swire Properties to raise money later, said
one of the people, who declined to be identified because the
information is private.  Swire Pacific scrapped a planned initial public offering of
the property unit last year because of “deteriorating market
conditions,” the Sept. 22 statement said. The company had
sought to raise as much as HK$20.8 billion ($2.7 billion),
people familiar with the matter said at the time.  Swire Properties has no “medium-term” need to raise funds
after the July sale of its Festival Walk mall in  Hong Kong ,
Chief Executive Officer Martin Cubbon said in an interview with
Bloomberg TV on Sept. 23. The sale gave the unit enough capital
to meet expenses for current projects in  China , he said.  Swire sold Festival Walk to a unit of  Singapore ’s Temasek
Holdings Pte for HK$18.8 billion.  Cindy Cheung, a Swire Pacific spokeswoman in Hong Kong,
said she couldn’t comment on details of the listing plan beyond
the Sept. 22 statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
