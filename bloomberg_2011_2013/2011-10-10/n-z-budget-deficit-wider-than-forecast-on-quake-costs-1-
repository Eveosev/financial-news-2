New Zealand ’s  budget deficit  was
wider in the fiscal year ended June 30 than earlier forecast
after higher-than-expected costs and liabilities from the
devastating Christchurch earthquake.  The deficit widened to a record NZ$18.4 billion ($14
billion) in the year through June, from a NZ$16.7 billion
estimate in the May budget, according to government financial
statements released today in Wellington. The deficit is before
gains and losses on investments held by state-owned financial
institutions, and grew from NZ$6.32 billion a year earlier.  Prime Minister John Key’s government expects to return the
budget to surplus by fiscal 2015 by reducing spending and
encouraging growth and job creation. Christchurch, the nation’s
second-biggest city, was devastated by earthquakes the past
year, including a February temblor that killed 181 people and
closed the central business district. Rebuilding is expected to
boost growth in 2012 and beyond.  “Setting aside the earthquakes we’ve made good progress
compared to estimates five months ago,” Finance Minister  Bill English  said in a statement. “The government remains committed
to halving the budget deficit this year before returning to
surplus in 2015.”  Today’s statements don’t contain fiscal forecasts or
revisions to the bond sales program, which will be published in
a pre-election update on Oct. 25.  Tax revenue rose by NZ$813 million from the year earlier to
NZ$51.56 billion, better than the May projections amid stronger
domestic demand and higher export prices which boosted company
profits and household incomes, Treasury said.  Estimates Double  Core government expenses rose by NZ$6.4 billion while total
expenses rose by NZ$18.9 billion, of which more than two thirds
was earthquake related. In August, the government’s insurance
estimates for the Christchurch earthquakes more than doubled
after reported wreckage of houses and land was worse than
previously calculated.  The government estimated that about 30,000 homes have
incurred more than NZ$100,000 in damages, after initially saying
the figure was around 12,000. Its land damage estimate has risen
to NZ$1.8 billion from between NZ$300 million and NZ$600
million.  The  Earthquake Commission , the state-owned insurer,
increased its estimated liability to NZ$7.47 billion from
NZ$3.05 billion, the Treasury said today.  Raising Levies  The government is raising levies that fund the commission
from next year, because the current charge imposed on home
owners is insufficient to meet long term costs, English said
today. Homeowners will pay 15 cents per NZ$100 of insurance
cover, up from 5 cents from Feb. 1. The payments are capped at
NZ$207 a year.  In addition to the commission’s liability, costs including
social assistance, purchase of condemned houses and support for
troubled insurer AMI bring the total earthquake bill, net of
insurance proceeds, to NZ$9.09 billion, Treasury said. More
expenses are still to come, the department said.  Net debt rose to 20 percent of gross domestic product at
June 30, from 14.1 percent a year earlier and less than the 20.8
percent projected in May, Treasury said.  Debt is likely to rise to 29.6 percent of GDP at its peak
in 2015 and decline to less than 20 percent by the early 2020s,
the government said in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
