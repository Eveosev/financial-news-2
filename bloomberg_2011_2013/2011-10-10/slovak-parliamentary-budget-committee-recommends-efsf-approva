Slovakia’s parliamentary budget
committee recommended the approval of enhancing the powers of
the European Financial Stability Facility, sending the
legislation to a vote by lawmakers as early as tomorrow.  The leaders of four governing parties in the euro region’s
second-poorest member will meet at 4 p.m. in the Slovak capital
Bratislava today to discuss conditions demanded by Freedom and
Solidarity, a junior coalition member, in return for its support
of the bailout system. Party Chairman Richard Sulik has said
repeatedly his lawmakers will reject the related legislation in
a vote tomorrow if conditions aren’t met.  To contact the reporter on this story:
