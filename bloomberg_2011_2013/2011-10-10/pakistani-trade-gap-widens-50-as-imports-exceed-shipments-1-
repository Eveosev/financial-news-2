Pakistan ’s trade deficit widened 50
percent in September as import growth exceeded the increase in
overseas shipments.  The gap widened to $1.79 billion, according to a statement
posted today on the website of the Islamabad-based  Federal
Bureau of Statistics . Export growth in September was 15.3
percent, faster than the 13 percent increase in August, and
imports rose 30.2 percent, faster than the 26.5 percent increase
last month.  Pakistan is seeking to boost exports after expansion slowed
because of the Taliban insurgency and record flooding. The
government targets economic growth of 4.2 percent in the 12
months that started July 1 compared with a growth rate of 2.4
percent last year, according to the  Finance Ministry .  South Asia ’s second-biggest economy exported $1.84 billion
of goods in September, compared with $1.6 billion a year
earlier, according to the statement. Imports rose to $3.6
billion from $2.78 billion.  Pakistan’s trade deficit widened 29 percent to $5.1 billion
in the quarter ended Sept. 30 as exports climbed 18.7 percent to
$6 billion and imports gained 23 percent to $11.1 billion,
according to the statistics bureau.  To contact the reporter on this story:
