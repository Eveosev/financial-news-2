Turkish competition regulators
quizzed bankers on whether they collaborate in setting lending
rates or when bidding for government debt, Haberturk newspaper
reported, without saying how it got the information.  Inspectors from the Ankara-based anti-trust watchdog
visited the treasury sections of many lenders last week,
demanding to see records and questioning staff, the newspaper
reported.  The issue of whether banks consult one another before
placing orders in auctions of government debt has already been
discussed by primary dealers in meetings with the Treasury, the
newspaper said, citing a banker it didnâ€™t identify.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
