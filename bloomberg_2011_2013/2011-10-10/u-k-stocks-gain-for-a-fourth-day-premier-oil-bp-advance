U.K. stocks climbed, as the
benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  posted its biggest four-day gain since
November 2008, as German and French leaders pledged to create a
plan in three weeks to recapitalize banks.  Premier Oil Plc (PMO)  gained 3.3 percent as the U.K. oil explorer
said it began production at its Chim Sao project in  Vietnam  and
after UBS AG, Morgan Stanley and HSBC Holdings Plc upgraded its
shares.  Burberry Group Plc (BRBY) , the U.K.’s largest luxury-goods
maker, advanced 1.7 percent. Kazakhmys Plc increased 3.4 percent
after Morgan Stanley picked it as a preferred copper miner.  The FTSE 100 Index rose 95.60, or 1.8 percent, to 5,399 at
the 4:30 p.m. close in  London . The gauge surged 9.2 percent in
the last four days. The broader FTSE All-Share Index also added
1.8 percent today and Ireland’s ISEQ Index increased 1.1
percent.  “Despite the lack of any material initiatives, it’s good
news that the two most important European Union leaders have
committed themselves to deliver results and provide the market
with a fixed date,” Mikkel Petersen, a senior equity adviser at
Nordea Private Bank in Copenhagen, wrote in a note to clients
today. “This should help curb day-to-day volatility.”  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  gave themselves until the end of October to
devise a plan to recapitalize banks, get  Greece  on the right
track and fix the euro area’s economic governance.  Premier Oil, BP  Premier Oil advanced 3.3 percent to 372.4 pence after
saying it began producing oil at Chim Sao. UBS raised the shares
to “buy” and HSBC and Morgan Stanley upgraded them to
“overweight.”  BP Plc (BP/) ,  Europe ’s second-biggest oil producer, advanced 2.9
percent to 405.15 pence as oil rose 3.2 percent. Amec Plc, the
oil and gas engineering firm, gained 2.7 percent to 852 pence.  A gauge of miners on the Stoxx Europe 600 Index was the
best performing of the 19 industry groups in the gauge.  The European crisis is the biggest risk for industrial
metals, with a possible Chinese slowdown viewed as less of a
concern, Macquarie Group Ltd. said in a report today. Metals are
oversold, with “macroeconomic fear currently outweighing still-
robust fundamentals,” the bank said, citing a poll taken during
last week’s London Metal Exchange Week.  Miners Rally  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  headed miners higher, gaining 3.7
percent to 2,417 pence.  Rio Tinto Plc. (RIO) , the world’s second-
biggest miner by output, rose 2.6 percent to 3,247.5 pence.
Kazakhmys rose 3.4 percent to 886.5 pence after Morgan Stanley
said it picked the London-based Central Asian miner as a
preferred copper miner.  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) , the copper miner
controlled by Chile’s richest family, the Luksic, rose 2.9
percent to 1,094 pence.  Imagination Technologies Group Plc (IMG)  gained 3.2 percent to
428.4 pence after JPMorgan Chase & Co. named the computer chip
technology firm its top European semiconductor pick. ARM

gained 6.6 percent to 591 pence.  Sportingbet Plc (SBT)  dropped 19 percent to 37 pence and U.K.
bookmaker  Ladbrokes Plc (LAD)  declined 0.8 percent to 119.7 pence
after the latter said talks with Sportingbet have been
“mutually terminated.” In a separate statement, Sportingbet
said it is not in discussions with any other party about a
possible offer.  Burberry advanced 1.7 percent to 1,261 pence after  Societe
Generale  said in a note to clients that shares in the luxury
goods maker have “priced in” the risk of recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
