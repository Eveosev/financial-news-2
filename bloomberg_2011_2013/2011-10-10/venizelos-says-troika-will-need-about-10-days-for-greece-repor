Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said talks with the heads of the mission of inspectors
from the European Union,  European Central Bank  and  International
Monetary Fund  had been effectively concluded.  The so-called troika will need about 10 days to prepare its
report, Venizelos told Athens-based Mega TV in an interview
today. Euro area finance ministers could meet on the report
before a summit of EU leaders on Oct. 23, he said.  “What needs to be done on our side is to do what we said
we will do by the end of October,” Venizelos said, referring to
getting parliamentary approval for the 2012 budget and new
austerity measures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
