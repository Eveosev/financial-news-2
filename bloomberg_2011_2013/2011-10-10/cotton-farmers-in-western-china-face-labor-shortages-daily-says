Cotton farmers in western  China â€™s
Xinjiang province are having difficulty finding enough labors to
harvest their crop after wages rose and the price of cotton
fell, the  China Daily  reported.  Labor costs have increased this year to at least 2 yuan for
every kilogram of cotton picked from 1.4 yuan last year, the
newspaper reported, citing local farmers. The price of cotton
has fallen to 8.4 yuan a kilogram from 10.8 yuan, according to
the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
