The Bovespa index rose the most in
two months as prospects for a solution to  Europe ’s debt crisis
lifted commodity prices and improved the outlook for  Brazil ’s
largest companies.  Vale SA, the world’s largest iron-ore producer, advanced
after metals reversed losses. Oil companies OGX Petroleo & Gas
Participacoes SA and Petroleo Brasileiro SA followed crude
higher. Lojas Renner SA, Brazil’s biggest publicly traded
clothing retailer, paced advances for companies that depend on
domestic demand even after economists raised their 2012 Brazil
inflation forecasts.  The Bovespa gained 4 percent to 53,273.11 at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, the most since Aug. 9. Sixty-five stocks
rose on the index while two dropped. The real strengthened 0.2
percent to 1.7675 per dollar.  “Everything’s gaining on Sarkozy and Merkel’s comments on
the plan to shore up banks,” said Alexandre Ghirghi, who
manages about 150 million reais ($84.9 million) at Metodo
Investimentos in  Sao Paulo .  Global stocks and commodities rose after the leaders of
France and  Germany  pledged a plan to stem the debt crisis in
three weeks. German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French
President  Nicolas Sarkozy  said yesterday they will deliver a
plan to recapitalize European banks and address the Greek debt
crisis by the Nov. 3 Group of 20 summit. Belgium said today it
will buy part of Dexia SA and provide security for depositors as
part of a plan to rescue the lender.  Commodities Rise  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw materials
advanced 2.1 percent. The Bloomberg Base Metals 3-Month Price
Commodity Index rose 1.5 percent after earlier falling as much
as 0.3 percent.  Vale rose 3.2 percent to 39.55 reais. OGX climbed 4.7
percent to 11.92 reais as state-controlled Petrobras rose 3.3
percent to 18.91 reais.  Economists covering Brazil raised their 2012 inflation
forecast for a sixth straight week after commodity prices rose
and the central bank signaled it will cut borrowing costs to
protect the country from turbulence in world markets. Consumer
prices will rise 5.59 percent next year, according to the median
forecast in an Oct. 7 central bank survey of about 100
economists published today, more than a forecast of 5.53 percent
the previous week.  Renner jumped 7.1 percent to 52.50 reais.  Foreign investors have pulled 360.1 million reais from
 Latin America ’s largest equity market in the year through
September, data from the Sao Paulo exchange show.  The index on Oct. 7 posted a third straight weekly drop,
the longest losing streak since June, on concern Europe’s debt
crisis will slow global growth while fewer interest-rate cuts in
Brazil may limit domestic demand.  Bear Market   The Bovespa entered a bear market in July after plunging 20
percent from its 2010 bull-market peak. The measure has since
extended that drop to 27 percent and trades at 8.9 times
analysts’ earnings estimates, weekly data compiled by Bloomberg
show. That compares to a ratio of 9.5 for MSCI Inc.’s gauge of
21 developing nations’ equities.  Traders moved 5.02 billion reais in stocks in Sao Paulo,
compared with a daily average this year of 6.3 billion reais,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
