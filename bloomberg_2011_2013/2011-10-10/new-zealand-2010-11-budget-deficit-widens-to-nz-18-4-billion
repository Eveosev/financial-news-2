New Zealand â€™s budget deficit was
wider in the fiscal year ended June 30 than earlier forecast
after higher-than-expected costs and liabilities from the
devastating Christchurch earthquake.  The deficit widened to a record NZ$18.4 billion ($14
billion) in the year through June, from a NZ$16.7 billion
estimate in the May budget, according to government financial
statements released today in Wellington. The deficit is before
gains and losses on investments held by state-owned financial
institutions, and grew from NZ$6.32 billion a year earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
