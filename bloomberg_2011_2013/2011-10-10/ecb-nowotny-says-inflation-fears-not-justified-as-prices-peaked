European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said inflation fears are unfounded
as prices will peak in the fourth quarter and retreat
afterwards.  “All economic forecasts anticipate that inflation rates
will peak this quarter and decrease in 2012,” Nowotny said in a
panel discussion in Vienna today. “However, fear is justified
on the development of the real economy,” he added.  To contact the reporters on this story:
