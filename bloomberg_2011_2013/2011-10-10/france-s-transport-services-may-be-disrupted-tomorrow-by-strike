France  is bracing for transport
disruptions tomorrow after some labor unions called for a 
strike against the government’s austerity measures.  “We want to send the government a message,” Francois Chereque , the general secretary of the Confederation Francaise
Democratique du Travail, said on Canal Plus television today.
“We want to say that it is particularly unjust that salaried
employees are being made to pay.”  PresidentNicolas Sarkozy has promised to slash the  budget
deficit  to 5.7 percent of gross domestic product this year, 4.5
percent next year and 3 percent in 2013. In August, he announced
12 billion euros ($16.3 billion) of measures to trim the
deficit.  While most Paris metros, buses and tramways will operate
normally, suburban rail services -- including to and from Orly
and Charles de Gaulle airports -- will be disrupted, RATP, the
capital city’s public transport company, said on its website.  National rail service SNCF said three out of four high-
speed TGV trains will operate normally, as will one out of two
intercity trains. International train services such as Eurostar
and Thalys will run normally, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
