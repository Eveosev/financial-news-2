Irish Life  & Permanent Plc is
seeking to sell its 500 million-euro ($680 million) subprime
mortgage book after being ordered by regulators to shrink its
loans, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  The Dublin-based company, the fifth Irish lender to fall
under state control, wants first-round bids for Springboard
Mortgages by the end of this week, according to one of the
people, who declined to be identified, as the sale isn’t public.  The government has injected 2.7 billion euros into Irish
Life, which is being split up. The company, which is selling
various loan books to lower its loan-to-deposit ratio, is also
looking for a buyer for its life assurance unit.  Irish Life established Springboard with Merrill Lynch & Co.
Inc. in January 2007 to sell mortgages to what it called “near
prime” customers without long credit histories or who had
irregular income sources. Irish Life bought out Merrill Lynch in
June 2008 and the unit stopped writing loans 12 months later.  The group has also hired KPMG LLP to advise on the disposal
of its 6.8 billion-pound ($10.6 billion) U.K. residential
mortgage book as it seeks to cut its loan-to-deposit ratio from
227 percent at the of June to a central bank target of 122.5
percent by 2014.  Irish Life spokesman  Ray Gordon  declined to comment on the
group’s plans to sell Springboard.  To contact the reporter on this story:
