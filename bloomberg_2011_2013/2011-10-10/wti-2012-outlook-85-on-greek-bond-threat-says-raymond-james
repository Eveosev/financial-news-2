Raymond James & Associates Inc.
downgraded a forecast for West Texas intermediate oil by 19
percent in 2012 on the threat of a potential default of Greek
bonds that could spread within  Europe ’s financial system.  The analysts lowered their 2012 forecasts for WTI oil to
$85 a barrel from $105 and for Brent to $100 a barrel from $115.
U.S. natural gas was lowered to $4 per thousand cubic feet from
$4.25.  “The short-term outlook for the global economy and oil
prices is as hazy as it’s been in nearly three years,”  Pavel Molchanov , one of the analysts, said in the report. Default of
Greek bonds “could easily set off even larger defaults,” he
wrote.  Long-term prices remain “very healthy” and the forecast
for $125 for both Brent and WTI in 2013 holds, according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
