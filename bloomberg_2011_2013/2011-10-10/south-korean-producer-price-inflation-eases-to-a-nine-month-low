South Korean producer prices rose at
the slowest pace in nine months in September, bolstering the
central bankâ€™s scope to leave interest rates unchanged this week.  Prices climbed 5.7 percent from a year earlier, after a 6.6
percent increase in August, the Bank of  Korea  said in a
statement in  Seoul  today. They increased 0.1 percent from August.  The Bank of Korea will leave its benchmark rate unchanged
at 3.25 percent on Oct. 13 for a fourth straight month,
according to all 11 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said yesterday consumer prices
show some signs of stabilizing, while adding that a weaker
currency may push up the cost of imported goods.  Consumer prices in  South Korea  increased 4.3 percent in
September from a year earlier, after a 5.3 percent gain in
August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
