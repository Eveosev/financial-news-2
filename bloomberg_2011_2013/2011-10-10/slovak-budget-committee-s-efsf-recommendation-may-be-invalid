A Slovak parliamentary budget
committee recommendation to approve an overhaul of the euro-
area’s bailout mechanism may be invalid due to procedural
reasons, the committee’s chief said.  Jozef Kollar, head of the committee, told reporters in
Bratislava, Slovakia, today that he will ask the constitutional
committee to rule on whether the vote today was valid. Kollar
said the committee may have needed a majority of seven members
to approve the international EFSF treaty, while only six
members, including Kollar, endorsed the resolution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
