 Carlos Ghosn  aims to reassert his control at the company with
appointments to be announced on Oct. 14, French daily La Tribune
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Farid Aractingi will be given a new post of head of audit
and risk management and will report directly to Ghosn, La
Tribune said. Mouna Sepehri will take over responsibility for
protection, public affairs and real estate, the newspaper added.  The newspaper cited Ghosn as saying that he has previously
