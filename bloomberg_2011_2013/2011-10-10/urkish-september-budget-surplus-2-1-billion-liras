Turkeyâ€™s budget produced a surplus
of 2.1 billion liras ($1.2 billion) in September compared to a
deficit a year earlier, the Treasury said.  The performance compared to a deficit of 6.8 billion liras
in September 2010, the Treasury in Ankara said on its website
today. Excluding interest payments on debt, the budget produced
a surplus of 5.7 billion liras, compared to a deficit of 3.8
billion liras a year earlier.  The Treasury figures are preliminary data that measure cash
inflows and outflows. The  Finance Ministry  will release full
budget numbers later this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
