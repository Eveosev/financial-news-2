Ireland has “ongoing issues” with
the country’s bailout partners, known as the troika, over
government hopes of using some proceeds from state-asset sales
for economic-growth initiatives, according to  Brian Hayes , a
junior government minister.    “What we need is a growth strategy allied with balancing
of the budget,” Hayes said in an interview with Dublin-based
broadcaster RTE Radio today. The government needs to deliver a
minimum of 3.6 billion euros of budget cuts in 2012, he said.  The troika, comprising the European Union,  European Central
Bank  and  International Monetary Fund , will review Ireland’s aid
program progress from Oct. 11 to Oct 20, he said. Hayes is a
junior minister at the ministries for finance and public
expenditure and reform.  To contact the reporter on this story:
