A measure of how much European banks
pay to fund in dollars declined for a third day, according to a
money markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency basis swap, the rate banks
pay to convert euro payments into dollars, fell to 95 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate as of 5:07 p.m. in
London, from 98 on Oct. 7, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the smallest gap since Sept. 19.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  will deliver a plan to recapitalize European
banks and address the Greek crisis by the Nov. 3 Group of 20
summit. The heads of Europe’s two biggest economies reiterated
their intention to keep  Greece  in the euro region, though left
it to international auditors to guide the next steps.  “Things are beginning to move in a positive fashion at a
political level,”  Padhraic Garvey , head of developed debt-
market strategy at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam, wrote in a note.  The one-year cross-currency basis swap was at 68 basis
points under Euribor, from 71 at the end of last week, the
smallest gap since Sept. 28. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  A measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another in
 Europe  was little changed. The Euribor-OIS spread, the
difference between the borrowing benchmark and overnight index
swaps was at 71 basis points compared with 72 on Oct. 7. The
gauge increased to 89 basis points on Sept. 23, the widest since
March 2009.  Overnight Deposits  Overnight deposits at the  European Central Bank  were at the
highest in more than a year. Banks parked 256 billion euros
($345 billion) at the Frankfurt-based ECB, up from 229 billion
euros on Oct. 6. That’s the highest since June 2010 and compares
with a year-to-date average of 54 billion euros.  Three-month Euribor -- the rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in euros -- rose to 1.567 percent from 1.566
percent on Friday. One-week Euribor rose to 1.185 percent from
1.178 percent.  The three-month dollar  London  interbank offered rate, or
Libor, rose for a 22nd day to 0.394 percent from 0.391 percent,
according to the British Bankers’ Association. That’s the
highest since Aug. 10, 2010.  The TED spread, or the difference between what lenders and
the U.S. government pay to borrow for three months rose to 38.9
basis points, the biggest gap since June 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
