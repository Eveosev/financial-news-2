General Electric Co. (GE) , the world’s
third-biggest supplier of  wind turbines , announced its first
investment in Indian renewable energy generation with plans to
build $115 million of wind farms with  Greenko Group Plc. (GKO)   GE Energy Financial Services will invest $50 million and
Greenko $65 million to create 500 megawatts of wind projects,
enough to power 875,000 Indian homes, according to a  statement 
on GE’s website. The deal expands GE’s $6 billion portfolio of
global clean-energy investments into a country that added the
most new wind capacity last year after China and the U.S.  The first 65-megawatt project, in Ratnagiri, Maharashtra
state, will use Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE’s 1.6-megawatt
turbines and be completed by December, it said. They will come
from GE’s plant in Pune.  Greenko estimates that the country has harnessed less than
25 percent of its wind-energy potential to date, the statement
said.  India  had about  15,000 megawatts  of wind capacity as of
Aug. 31, according to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.  GE was the third-largest supplier of wind turbines in 2010,
behind Denmark’s Vestas Wind Systems A/S and China’s Sinovel
Wind Group Co., according BTM Consult ApS, a Denmark-based wind
industry researcher.  Greenko, based in Douglas, Isle of Man, and backed by
private equity firm TPG Capital, has plans for 1-gigawatt of
Indian wind capacity by 2015. It’s putting up farms in  Andhra
Pradesh , Karnataka and Rajasthan states, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
