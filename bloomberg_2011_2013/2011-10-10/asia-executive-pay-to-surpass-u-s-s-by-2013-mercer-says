Asian executives’ pay will surpass
that of their counterparts in the  United States  by 2013 after
overtaking salaries in Western Europe last year, Hans Kothuis,
Asia Pacific leader for rewards at Mercer LLC, said in an e-
mailed statement today.  “Increased pay restraint” in Western Europe and  North
America , and economic growth in emerging markets, contributed to
higher executive salaries in Asia, according to the statement.  Average executive pay in Asia rose 7 percent this year,
compared with a gain of about 2.5 percent in Europe and around 3
percent in the U.S. and Canada, the statement said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
