Clarion Partners , a New York-based
real estate investment manager, bought a 586-unit California
apartment portfolio for $100 million, adding properties aimed at
senior citizens to capitalize on an aging population.  The deal encompasses the Buena Vida at Town Center in
Rancho Santa Margarita, the Village on the Green in Rancho
Cucamonga and the Oak View at Sonoma Hills in Sonoma County, the
company said in a statement today. The seller was  Kisco Senior
Living , a Carlsbad, California-based owner of housing
communities across the U.S., according to Suzanne Franks, a
Clarion vice president.  The acquisition will help Clarion target aging baby
boomers, “one of the strongest segments of demand within the
current real estate market,” Richard Pink, managing director,
said in the statement.  The number of Americans aged 65 and older will increase
from 38 million to about 44 million from 2008 to 2013, according
to Clarion. After 2015, the senior population will grow at a
rate of about 2 million people each year, the company said.  The three complexes have occupancy rates of at least 95
percent, according to the statement. They offer residents
maintenance-free living and easy access to recreational and
leisure activities, Clarion said.  “These three properties are all best in class, with
substantial amenities and excellent locations in the highly
desirable California market,” Pink said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
