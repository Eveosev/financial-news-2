The following table compares the median 
estimates of the top five economists with those of all the economists 
in the  Central Bank ’s weekly survey.  The Central Bank determines the 
top five economists for each indicator based on their previous estimates 
for that indicator in the short-term.   NOTE: The Central Bank surveys approx. 100 economists who work
for Brazilian financial institutions.  SOURCE: Central Bank of Brazil  To contact the reporter on this story:
