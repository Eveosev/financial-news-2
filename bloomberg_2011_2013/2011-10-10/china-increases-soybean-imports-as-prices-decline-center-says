China increased purchases of
soybeans and  soybean oil  after global prices slumped, state-
owned researcher Grain.gov.cn said.  From the end of last month to the first week in October,
domestic companies purchased a total of 22 cargos of soybeans
and 80,000 metric tons of soybean oil, the center said in an e-
mailed daily report without giving any comparative figures.  Most orders will be delivered next year, it said. Inbound
shipments of soybeans due for delivery this year are estimated
at 4.3 million tons, 5.2 million tons and 4.7 million tons for
October, November and December, respectively, based on the
orders placed so far, the center said.  Soybean futures for delivery in November advanced as much
as 2.6 percent to $11.88 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade
and traded at $11.86 at 5:15 p.m. Singapore time. Futures
dropped 1.8 percent last week, extending their decline from
September when they fell 19 percent. Soybean oil for December
rose 1.9 percent to 50.27 cents per pound after a 1.8 percent
drop last week.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
