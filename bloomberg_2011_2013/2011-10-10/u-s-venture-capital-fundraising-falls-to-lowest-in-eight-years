U.S. venture capital fundraising
dropped to the lowest in eight years in the third quarter as a
slowing economic recovery and debt crisis in  Europe  led to fewer
initial public offerings.  Venture firms raised $1.72 billion in the period, down 53
percent from the same period a year earlier and the lowest
amount since the third quarter of 2003, the National Venture
Capital Association said today in a statement.  Companies canceled or postponed $8.9 billion in IPOs in the
third quarter as stocks plunged, hurting returns for venture
capitalists and investors in their funds. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index tumbled 14 percent in the quarter, the biggest decline
since the fourth quarter of 2008. Volatility surged amid an
intensifying European debt crisis and a U.S. credit downgrade
from ratings service S&P.  “The quarter’s low fundraising numbers are reflective of
ongoing challenges within the venture capital exit markets,”
said  Mark Heesen , president of the Arlington, Virginia-based
NVCA, in the statement. “Economic instability continues to
impact the ability of venture-backed companies to go public
which, in turn, has prevented many venture firms from delivering
solid returns to their investors.”  The biggest fund was raised by  Shasta Ventures  in  Menlo
Park ,  California , which brought in $265 million. Longitude
Venture Partners, a life sciences firm also in Menlo Park,
raised the second biggest fund at $159 million. The data was
compiled by the NVCA and Thomson Reuters Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
