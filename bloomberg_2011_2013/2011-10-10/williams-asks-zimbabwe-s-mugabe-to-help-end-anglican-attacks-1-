The Archbishop of Canterbury  Rowan
Williams , the head of the Anglican Church, asked Zimbabwe’s
President  Robert Mugabe  to help end attacks on its members by a
splinter faction of the religious group, he said today.  The religious leader gave Mugabe information on “the
abuses to which our people and our church have been subject,”
he told reporters following a meeting with the president in
Harare, the capital. “We have asked, in the clearest possible
terms, that the president use his powers as head of state to put
an end to all unacceptable and illegal behavior,” he said.  Williams met with Prime Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai , who
deplored the attacks.  “The state has no role in the church but to protect people
when they do pray,” Tsvangirai said. “I hope we do find a
solution to this, people are suffering needlessly.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
