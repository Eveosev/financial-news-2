Exports of  North Sea  Alvheim crude
for November are scheduled at five cargoes, one less than this
month, a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  The November program comprises five 780,000-barrel
shipments, the plan showed. This amounts to 3.9 million barrels,
or 130,000 barrels a day, compared with 150,968 barrels a day
this month, according to the plan. Houston-based Marathon Oil
Corp. operates the  field  in the Norwegian North Sea.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
