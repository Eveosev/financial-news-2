European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said it’s better to be prepared for
the worst with respect to  Greece .  “Nobody can seriously predict at the moment” whether
Greece will face a debt cut, Nowotny told reporters in Vienna
today. “But it’s certainly not the wrong strategy rather to
expect the worse case instead of the better one.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
