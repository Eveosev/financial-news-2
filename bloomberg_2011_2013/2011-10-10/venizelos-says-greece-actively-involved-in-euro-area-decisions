Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said the country was actively involved in the most
recent developments in the euro area.  “ Greece  has fiscal problems and depends on the support of
its institutional partners,” Venizelos said in an e-mailed

however, and will continue to be an equal and active member of
