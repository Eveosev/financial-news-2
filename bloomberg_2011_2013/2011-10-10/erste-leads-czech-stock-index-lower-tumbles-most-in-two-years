Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  slumped the most
in more than two and a half years in Prague trading, leading a
decline of the Czech  stock index  after the Austrian lender said
it will post a loss.  Erste fell 13 percent to 444 koruna at the 4:24 p.m. close
in Prague, the biggest one-day drop since February 2009. The PX
equity gauge retreated 1.8 percent as Erste’s losses outweighed
gains for CEZ AS, New World Resources Plc and  Orco Property
Group (ORC)  SA.  Vienna-based Erste said today it won’t pay a dividend this
year and has shelved plans for an early repayment of 1.2 billion
euros (1.6 billion) of  government aid  as it expects to post a
full-year loss of as much as 800 million euros after writedowns
on its Hungarian and Romanian units.  “The two writedowns will have no direct impact on the
bank’s regulatory capital, but will obviously be negative for
earnings,” analyst Marek Hatlapatka at Cyrrus brokerage in
Brno,  Czech Republic , wrote in a report today.  New World Resources, the biggest Czech coking-coal
producer, rose 1.5 percent to 139 koruna, its fourth day of
gains.  Europe ’s benchmark coal derivatives increased to $120.8
per metric ton, the highest closing price this month.  CEZ AS (CEZ) , the country’s biggest utility, rose 1.6 percent to
712 koruna, the highest close this month. Electricity for next-
year delivery in  Germany , where CEZ exports part of its output,
climbed 0.5 percent to 56.1 euros per megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
