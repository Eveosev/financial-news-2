Shui On Development Holding Ltd., a
unit of Shanghai-based developer  Shui On Land Ltd. (272) , hired  Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  to help arrange and market $410 million in
loans, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The $410 million facility includes $348 million in offshore
term loans and a $62 million onshore term loan, the person said,
asking not to be identified as the details are private. Both
facilities mature in three years, the person said.  The offshore portion includes a $252 million senior debt
tranche and a $96 million so-called hybrid tranche. The hybrid
tranche includes a corporate guarantee but contains more
subordinated debt than senior debt, said the person.  Banks are invited to join the loan at four levels, with
commitments from $15 million to $75 million or more. Banks
joining at the top level with commitments of at least $75
million will receive an all-in payment of 365 basis points more
than the London interbank offered rate on the onshore and
offshore senior tranche and an all-in fee of 400 basis points
more than Libor on the offshore hybrid tranche, according to a
document seen by Bloomberg News.  The margin on the loan is 310 basis points more than Libor
for the onshore and offshore senior debt tranche and 345 basis
points more than Libor for the offshore hybrid tranche.  To contact the reporter on this story:
