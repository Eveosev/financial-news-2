What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 20 cents to 25 cents a bushel higher
on the Chicago Board of Trade as U.S. exports rebound following
a five-week price slump,  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst at
Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in  Minneapolis , said in a
telephone interview. Yields from crops that farmers currently
are harvesting in the Midwest might trail government forecasts,
he said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open up 0.8 cent to
1 cent a pound. Soybean-meal futures may open $4 to $5 higher
for 2,000 pounds.  -- Corn may open 8 cents to 12 cents a bushel higher in Chicago
on speculation that demand for food, fuel and livestock feed
made from the grain will increase after prices slumped in
September, Schultz said.  -- Wheat futures may open 10 cents to 15 cents a bushel higher
on the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  as prospects improve for the global economy,
boosting demand for grain, Schultz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
