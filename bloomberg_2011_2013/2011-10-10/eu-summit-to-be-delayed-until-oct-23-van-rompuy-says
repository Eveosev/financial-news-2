European Union President  Herman Van
Rompuy  pushed back an Oct. 17-18 meeting of government leaders
to Oct. 23 as the region seeks to stem the Greece-
triggered debt crisis.  “This timing will allow to finalize our comprehensive 
strategy on the euro-area sovereign-debt crisis covering a
number of interrelated issues,”  Van Rompuy  said today in a
statement. “Significant progress has been accomplished in the
implementation of the July package.”  The EU’s 27 national leaders had been due to meet on Oct.
17 and euro-area leaders planned to gather on Oct. 18.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
