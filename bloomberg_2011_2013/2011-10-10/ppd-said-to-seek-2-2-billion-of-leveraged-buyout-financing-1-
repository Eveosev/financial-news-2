Pharmaceutical Product Development
Inc. (PPDI)  plans to finance its buyout by Carlyle Group and Hellman &
Friedman LLC with $2.2 billion of debt, according to a person
with knowledge of the matter.  The company is seeking a $1.33 billion first-lien term
loan, a $175 million revolving  credit line  and $700 million of
bridge financing, said the person, who declined to be identified
because the deal is private.  Carlyle and Hellman & Friedman have agreed to buy
Pharmaceutical Product Development in a deal valued at $3.9
billion. The buyout firms are taking the Wilmington, North
Carolina-based pharmaceutical-research business private for
$33.25 a share, according to an Oct. 3 statement from PPD.  Credit Suisse AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and UBS AG have provided debt financing commitments for the
deal, the company said.  Elizabeth Kuronen, a spokeswoman for Pharmaceutical Product
Development, and  Chris Ullman , a spokesman for Carlyle, didnâ€™t
immediately return telephone calls seeking comment. Kelly Smith,
a spokeswoman for Hellman & Friedman, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
