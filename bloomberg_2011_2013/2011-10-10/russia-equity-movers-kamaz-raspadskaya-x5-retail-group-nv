The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  slid 0.6
percent to 1,343.12 by 12:36 p.m. in Moscow, paring an earlier
loss of as much as 1.1 percent. The dollar-denominated RTS Index
gained 0.4 percent to 1,316.55 rubles.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
Russian market today. Stock symbols are in parenthesis:  OAO KamAZ (KMAZ RX) climbed for a fourth day after the
Russian truck producer, partly owned by Daimler AG, swung to
profit in the first half as sales surged 39 percent. The shares
jumped as much as 5 percent and last traded 2.2 percent higher
at 43.32 rubles.  OAO  Raspadskaya (RASP)   rose for a third day after the
coal producer said on Oct. 7 it had started work at a coal face
with reserves of 1.4 million metric tons at its flagship mine.
The shares added as much as 7.3 percent and last traded 1.2
percent higher at 82.98 rubles.  X5 Retail Group NV (FIVE)   slumped the most in almost a
week after the Russian retailer lowered its 2011 gross retail
sales-growth forecast to about 35 percent from an initial target
of 40 percent, citing a “rapidly weakening macroeconomic
environment” and the rebranding of its Kopeyka stores. The
London-traded shares dropped 6.6 percent to $25.17, their
steepest intraday retreat since Oct. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
