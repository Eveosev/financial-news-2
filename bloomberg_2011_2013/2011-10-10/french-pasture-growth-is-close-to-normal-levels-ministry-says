French grasslands partially
recovered from a dry spring with “good” growth in the north,
and pasture production for the country is approaching normal
levels, the  Agriculture Ministry  said.  For half the country, growth during the summer months and
into September means forage levels are getting close to normal,
while in 10 percent of  France , output is less than 50 percent of
normal pasture production, the ministry said in a report on its
website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
