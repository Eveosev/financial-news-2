Manchester United midfielder Tom Cleverley has been rewarded for breaking into the Premier League
soccer champion’s team this season with a new four-year
contract.  The 22-year-old started in United’s opening four Premier
League games before being sidelined after suffering an ankle
injury against Bolton in September.  “Tom is one of the brightest prospects in the English
game,” United manager  Alex Ferguson  told the club’s  website .
“For a young boy, he has a good footballing brain which, when
coupled with his energy and ability, makes for a player with a
fine future.”  Cleverley  had not played for the club before August, with
his only first-team experience coming from loans at Leicester,
Watford and Wigan. He was called into the England squad this
season, but is yet to make his international debut.  To contact the reporter on this story:
