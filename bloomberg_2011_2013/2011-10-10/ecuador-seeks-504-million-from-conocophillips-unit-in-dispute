Ecuador  said it’s suing a
 ConocoPhillips (COP)  subsidiary for $504 million as part of a dispute
over alleged environmental damage caused by the company’s oil
operations in the South American country.  Ecuador wants $488 million to clean up areas in the Amazon
region where subsidiary Burlington Resources Oriente Ltd.
operated and an additional $16 million to repair drilling
infrastructure, the Attorney General said today in an e-mailed
statement. The agency filed its lawsuit against the company on
Sept. 30.  The lawsuit against Burlington is part of an arbitration
case at the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes after Ecuador seized the company’s oil
fields over a tax dispute in 2009. Burlington was a minority
partner with  France ’s Perenco SA in the Block 21 and Block 7
concession areas in the northeast.  Ecuador “presented countersuits for environmental damage
caused by the U.S. company as well as for the poor state of the
infrastructure,” the Attorney General’s Office said. The nation
wants the court “to declare Burlington responsible and order
them to pay the damages in their entirety.”  ConocoPhillips’s press office in Houston didn’t immediately
respond to a telephone message seeking comment. Calls to
Burlington’s offices in Quito went unanswered.  The arbitration court is expected to make a final ruling on
the case in 2013, the Attorney General’s Office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
