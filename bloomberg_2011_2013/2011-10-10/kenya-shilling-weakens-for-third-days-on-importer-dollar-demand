Kenya ’s shilling weakened for the
third day against the dollar and headed for its weakest closing
level on record as importers increased demand.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated
as much as 0.9 percent to 103.45 per dollar and traded 0.8
percent lower at 103.35 by 11:51 a.m in Nairobi, the capital.  “The shilling has weakened on aggressive dollar demand
from importers and with market sentiments and fundamentals
against it, it’s likely to breach the 104 to the dollar levels
in the coming days,” Duncan Kinuthia, a dealer at Nairobi-based
Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said by phone today.
