Tipco Asphalt Pcl (TASCO) , Thailand’s
largest asphalt producer, gained the most in more than 11 years
in Bangkok trading on expectation that demand for the road-
paving material will jump as floods damage roads.  The shares surged 29 percent to 51.75 baht at the close in
Bangkok, the largest increase since March 2000. The stock was
the second-best performer in the 485-member SET Index, which
rose 1.5 percent.  “Tipco Asphalt is among the biggest beneficiaries with the
current flooding crisis,” Surachai Pramualcharoenkit, an
analyst at Trinity Securities Co. in Bangkok, said by phone
today. “Investors are betting demand for asphalt will surge as
flooding damages a lot of roads and highways.”  At least 269 people have been killed and 2.4 million
displaced as a result of the seasonal monsoon rains that have
hit the country since July 25, the Department of Disaster
Prevention and Mitigation said today. About 30 of  Thailand ’s 77
provinces remain underwater, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
