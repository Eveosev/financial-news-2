Vitruvian Partners LLP, a U.K.
private-equity firm investing its 925 million-pound ($1.44
billion) inaugural fund, will buy a little more than half of
College Group, a London-based communications consulting company,
in a transaction that values the business at about 45 million
pounds, the Financial Times reported.  Alex Sandberg, Collegeâ€™s chairman and biggest shareholder,
told the newspaper the business has trebled in size in four
years and revenue is now about 40 million pounds a year.  Sandberg and about 130 employee shareholders, led by Chief
Executive Officer Richard Nichols, will sell about half of their
shares; the cash raised will be used for expansion, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
