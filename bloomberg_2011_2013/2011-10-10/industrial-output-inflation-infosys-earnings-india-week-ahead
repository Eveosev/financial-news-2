India  will report this week
industrial production for August and inflation for September,
data that may help the central bank determine whether to raise
 interest rates  further this month.  Output at factories, utilities and mines rose 3.3 percent
in July from a year earlier, the slowest pace in almost two
years. The  Central Statistical Organisation  is due to release
the latest numbers on Oct. 12. The commerce ministry is
scheduled to announce the wholesale-price index on Oct. 14 after
saying the benchmark gauge of inflation rose to a 13-month high
of 9.78 percent in August.  The  Reserve Bank  of India has raised its repurchase rate 12
times starting March, 2010, to temper price increases in a
nation where the  World Bank  says more than 75 percent of the
population lives on less than $2 a day. The central board of the
bank will meet in Jaipur, Rajasthan, on Oct. 13 to discuss the
state of the economy, and Governor Duvvuri Subbarao will decide
on borrowing costs at a separate meeting on Oct. 25 in Mumbai.  Price increases beyond a 6 percent threshold aren’t
“acceptable,” Subbarao said last month.  Infosys Ltd., India’s second-largest software exporter,
will report on Oct. 12 earnings for the three months ended Sept.
30. The Bangalore-based company, in July, said net income in the
quarter to June 30 rose 16 percent from a year earlier, and
forecast annual sales of as much as $7.3 billion, missing
analysts’ forecast.  Stocks, Currency  Indian stocks retreated last week after a report by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics showed the nation’s
manufacturing expanded in September at the slowest pace since
March, 2009, and as Moody’s Investors Service cut its rating on
 State Bank of India (SBIN) ’s financial strength.  The BSE India Sensitive Index shed 1.3 percent to 16,232.54.
 State Bank , the nation’s largest lender, tumbled 8.3 percent to
be the biggest decliner on the 30-stock gauge.  Jindal Steel &
Power Ltd. (JSP)  plunged 4.5 percent.  The rupee fell 0.4 percent last week, extending losses
after completing its worst quarter in almost a decade. It traded
at 49.16 a dollar on Oct. 7 in Mumbai.  Benchmark 10-year bonds fell for a second week, driving
yields higher, on speculation investors will cut holdings after
the government said it will borrow more than planned earlier.
The yield on the 7.8 percent bonds due April 2021 jumped 13
basis points last week, or 0.13 percentage point, to 8.58
percent, a three-year high for a 10-year security, according to
the central bank’s trading system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
