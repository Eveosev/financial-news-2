OAO Gazprom, the state-controlled
monopoly exporter of Russian natural gas, set up a department to
lobby the government on taxation after the  Finance Ministry 
proposed doubling the company’s payments on mineral extraction.  The lobby will seek to “defend the company’s interests”
in government negotiations and support “key infrastructure
projects,” the company said today in an e-mailed statement.  The Finance Ministry proposed doubling the extraction tax
from next year. The producer is also seeking tax breaks to
develop offshore projects such as Shtokman and Prirazlomnoye in
the Arctic, and gas developments in  Russia ’s Far East.  Karen Oganyan will head the department, Gazprom said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
