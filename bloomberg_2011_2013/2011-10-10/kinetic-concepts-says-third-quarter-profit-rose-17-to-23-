Kinetic Concepts Inc. (KCI) , the wound-
care company getting bought by Apax Partners Inc., said third-
quarter profit rose 17 to 23 percent as revenue from its
LifeCell unit increased.  The preliminary results were released to help potential
investors evaluate the companyâ€™s performance while it plans a
bond offering, San Antonio-based Kinetic said in a statement
today.  Kinetic is cutting the size of a speculative-grade bond
offering to $1.65 billion from $2.55 billion, according to a
person with knowledge of the transaction. In July, the company
agreed to be acquired by Apax, the Canada Pension Plan
Investment Board and the Public Sector Pension Investment Board
for $68.50 a share, a transaction valued at $5.7 billion,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Third-quarter earnings were $89 million to $93 million as
worldwide revenue rose 4 to 5 percent, Kinetic said in the
statement. The company plans to release full results on Oct. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
