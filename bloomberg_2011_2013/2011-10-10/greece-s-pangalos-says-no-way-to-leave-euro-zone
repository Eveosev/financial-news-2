Leaving the euro zone or being
forced out of it is “impossible,” Greek Deputy Prime Minister
Theodoros Pangalos said.  “I don’t think there is any possibility of anybody leaving
the Euorpean monetary zone, or of kicking somebody out,”
Pangalos said at a meeting with reporters in Paris “The euro
system is not a system that provides for an exit. We have never
thought about that.”  He said he has no regrets about  Greece  joining the euro.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
