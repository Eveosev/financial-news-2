Hurricane Jova may strengthen into a
Category 4 storm today as it moves east over the  Pacific Ocean 
toward Mexico, packing winds of as much as 120 miles (193
kilometers) per hour.  The hurricane was about 255 miles southwest of Manzanillo,
Mexico, at 5 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time and moving east at 6
mph, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said in an  advisory . A
Category 4 storm on the  Saffir-Simpson  scale is capable of
causing “catastrophic damage,” according to the NHC.  “Additional strengthening is forecast during the next day
or so and Jova could become a Category 4 hurricane later
today,” the NHC said, adding that “fluctuations in intensity
are possible until landfall.” The center of the hurricane will
approach Mexico’s coast by tomorrow afternoon, it said.  The Mexican government issued a  hurricane warning  for Punta
San Telmo north to Cabo Corrientes, and a tropical-storm warning
from  Lazaro Cardenas  to south of Punta San Telmo, the advisory
showed.  A storm surge may cause “life-threatening” floods in
coastal areas and surfs could swell to dangerous levels,
according to the advisory. As much as 15 inches (38 centimeters)
of rain is possible in some places, the NHC said.  Irwin , a tropical storm in the Eastern Pacific, is 790
miles southwest of the southern tip of Baja California with
winds of 50 mph, down from hurricane strength earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
