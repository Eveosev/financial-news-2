The rand appreciated to its
strongest level in more than a week against the dollar as a new
pledge to stem  Europe ’s debt crisis and signs of a recovery in
the  U.S. economy  spurred demand for riskier assets.  The South African currency climbed as much as 2.1 percent
to 7.8344 per dollar, the highest since Sept. 29. It traded 1.8
percent higher at 7.8576 by 3:48 p.m. in Johannesburg. Against
the euro, the rand slipped 0.1 percent to 10.7015.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  will deliver a plan to recapitalize European
banks and address the Greek debt crisis by the Nov. 3 Group of
20 summit. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Macroeconomic Advisers
LLC raised their U.S. growth forecasts in the third quarter,
after an Oct. 7 report showing a 103,000 advance in payrolls.
The Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of raw materials and  South
Africa ’s benchmark stock index advanced for a fourth day.  “The pendulum seems to have swung back in favor of
improved sentiment,” Tradition Analytics strategists led by
Johannesburg-based Quinten Bertenshaw wrote in e-mailed
comments. “A steady rotation away from safe-haven assets should
see risk assets benefit.”  Foreign investors were net buyers of 1.65 billion rand
($210 million) of South African stocks and bonds last week,
after selling 4.79 billion of securities the week before,
according to JSE Ltd. data.  The rand may advance to 7.73 per dollar after breaching
7.90, the Tradition analysts wrote.  Bonds Rally  Bonds gained for a fifth day on speculation the stronger
rand will reduce inflationary pressures, giving the central bank
more room to cut  interest rates . The yield on the 6.75 percent
securities due 2021 dropped 11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage
point, to 8.01 percent, the lowest since Sept. 16.  “Any firm recovery in the rand would dilute any
expectation of a strong rise in inflation and trigger a rethink
on the outlook for rates,” Tradition wrote. “Interest rates,
inflation and growth could remain a lot softer than the market
has priced in,” spurring demand for longer-term debt, they
added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
