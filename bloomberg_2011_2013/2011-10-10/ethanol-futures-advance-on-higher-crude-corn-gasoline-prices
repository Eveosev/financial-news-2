Ethanol gained for the first day in
three as crude-oil futures reached a two-week high and corn and
gasoline prices climbed.  Ethanol rose with commodities after German Chancellor
Angela Merkel and French President Nicholas Sarkozy said
yesterday they will deliver a plan to recapitalize the region’s
banks and address the Greek crisis by Nov. 3. Gasoline settled
at the highest level since Sept. 27. Corn rose for the second
day in four.  “It was a pretty good, well-bid day for ethanol and
energies across the board,” Justin Dirico, senior ethanol
trader at SCB & Associates LLC in  Chicago , said by telephone.  Denatured ethanol for November delivery rose 3.2 cents, or
1.3 percent, to settle at $2.52 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  gained 4 cents,
or 1.5 percent, to $2.79 a gallon, and on the West Coast the
biofuel added 9 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $2.805, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf jumped 10.5 cents, or 4 percent,
to $2.74 a gallon, and in Chicago the additive climbed 9.5
cents, or 3.7 percent, to $2.64, Bloomberg data show.  Crude oil for November delivery rose $2.43, or 2.9 percent,
to $85.41 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the
highest settlement in more than two weeks.  Gasoline for November delivery gained 4.77 cents, or 1.8
percent, to settle at $2.6953 a gallon in New York. The contract
covers reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with
ethanol before delivery to filling stations. Earlier, futures
advanced as much as 2.8 percent to $2.7219.  Corn for December delivery gained 5 cents, or 0.8 percent,
to $6.05 a bushel in Chicago after reaching an intraday high of
$6.185. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
