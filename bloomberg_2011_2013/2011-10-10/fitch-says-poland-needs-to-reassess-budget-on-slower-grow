Poland needs to reassess its fiscal
consolidation plans since economic growth next year may be
slower than the “optimistic” 4 percent rate needed to cut the
 budget deficit  below the government’s target of 3 percent of
gross domestic product,  Fitch Ratings  said today in a statement.  “More drastic” fiscal measures are needed if the
government is “serious” about reaching the deficit target,
Fitch said. While the ratings company said it doesn’t expect
“significant slippage” of budget targets now that the
coalition government has won re-election, such concern will
remain as “a key rating driver.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
