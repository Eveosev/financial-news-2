Malta’s Parliament approved expanded
powers for  Europe ’s temporary rescue fund, leaving Slovakia as
the only euro-area nation yet to vote on the plan.  Lawmakers in Valletta voted last night to back measures
that broaden the scope of the European Financial Stability
Facility.  The unanimous vote came after a five-hour sitting during
which opposition lawmaker and former Premier Alfred Sant raised
questions about the drafting of the resolution to ratify the
EFSF and the procedures followed by the Maltese parliament.  Malta seeks financial and economic stability in Europe and
the “unanimous vote is a clear signal that even the smallest EU
and eurozone state is loyal to its obligations,” Finance
Minister Tonio Fenech said in an interview in parliament after
the vote.  Slovakia’s parliament will begin debating the measure
today, though allies within the country’s ruling coalition
remain divided over supporting the broader powers for the
bailout mechanism.  The euro has lost more than 5 percent in the past month as
Europe struggles to contain the debt crisis that has spread
across the continent over the last year from  Greece .  The enhanced powers of the 440 billion-euro ($600 billion)
EFSF were approved at a July 21 meeting of European leaders in
Brussels. The measures would allow the fund to buy the debt of
stressed euro-area nations, aid troubled banks in the region and
offer credit lines to governments. The EFSF’s current role is to
sell bonds to finance rescue loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
