Press Release  Romney Maintains Overall Lead in Popularity with Cain in Second
Place on Eve of Bloomberg-Washington Post Republican Debate,
Focused on the Economy  New York -- Businessman  Herman Cain  is almost even with  Mitt
Romney  in his appeal as an economic leader to Republicans and
Republican-leaning independents.  Asked which candidate would do the most to improve the economy,
22 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents
said Romney, 20 percent Cain, a former chief executive officer
of Godfather’s Pizza, and 12 percent Texas Governor  Rick Perry .  Romney, a former private equity executive and Massachusetts
governor, maintains his overall lead in popularity among
Republican supporters at 24 percent with Cain in second place at
16 percent on the eve of a Bloomberg-Washington Post Republican
presidential debate that will focus on economic issues,
according to a national poll by the two news organizations.  The poll results underscore the public’s unsettled mood on the
economy. More than half of all Americans think another financial
crisis is likely within the next several years. Much of the
nation doubts the winner of the presidential race will affect
the economic situation or their personal finances, and those who
do are about evenly split on who would do better.  The full story is available at:
