Houston Texans linebacker Mario Williams, a two-time Pro Bowl selection, will miss the rest of
the season with a torn pectoral muscle, the Houston Chronicle
 reports .  Williams, 26, will have surgery later this week, the
newspaper said, without saying where it obtained the
information.  The top overall pick in the 2006 National Football League
draft, Williams left in the first quarter of the team’s 25-20
loss to the Oakland Raiders yesterday after sacking quarterback
Jason Campbell.  Texans spokesman Kevin Cooper said the team won’t have an
announcement until head coach Gary Kubiak addresses injuries at
a news conference later this afternoon.  The two time Pro Bowl selection has 52 sacks and 11 forced
fumbles in 81 games with the team.  The Texans are 3-2, tied with the  Tennessee Titans  for
first place in the American Football Conference South division.
Last week the team said that five-time Pro Bowl wide receiver
 Andre Johnson  was out indefinitely after undergoing a minor
procedure on his right hamstring.  -- Editor: Jay Beberman  To contact the reporter on this story:
