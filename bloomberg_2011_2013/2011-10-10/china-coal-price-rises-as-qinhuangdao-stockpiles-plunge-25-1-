Coal for generating power rose at
 China ’s Qinhuangdao port as inventories plunged to the lowest
level in two years as utilities bought more before winter.  Coal with an energy value of 5,500 kilocalories per
kilogram rose 0.6 percent to a range of 840 yuan ($132) to 850
yuan a metric ton yesterday, compared with two weeks earlier,
according to data today from the China Coal Transport and
Distribution Association. The association didn’t publish data a
week ago because of a national holiday.  Stockpiles at the port, which ships half of China’s
seaborne coal supplies, fell 25 percent to 4.41 million tons
from two weeks earlier. That’s the lowest level since
inventories dropped to 4.06 million tons on Oct. 11, 2009.  Power plants  in China typically start buying fuel from late
September before peak heating demand during the colder months.
This year, the biggest railway carrying coal from the northern
mining province of Shanxi to Qinhuangdao started repairs on Sept.
21 for as long as 15 days, according to the Qinhuangdao Seaborne
Coal Market  industry website . The Daqin Railway repairs would
cut daily capacity by 300,000 tons, the website said.  “Stockpiles fell as supplies reaching Qinhuangdao
decreased because of the Daqin maintenance,” according to a
report  published  on the association’s website today. “Demand
for coal also has risen as major power stations and heating
companies started stockpiling coal early.”  Coal prices at Qinhuangdao are expected to remain steady in
October as rising domestic demand is offset by increasing
imports, the association said in the report.  China’s coal imports rose to a record 17.5 million tons in
July, according to customs data. Overseas purchases fell to 16.6
million tons in August, still 27 percent above the 13.1 million-
ton monthly average from January to August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
