The Czech Republic’s PX stock index
fell 1.8 percent to 932.9 at its 4:28 p.m. close in  Prague ,
snapping a three-day advance.  The following were among the most active equities on the
Prague Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  CEZ AS (CEZ)  , the country’s biggest electricity company,
rose 1.6 percent to 712 koruna, its highest close this month.
Power for next-year delivery in  Germany , where CEZ exports part
of its output, climbed to 56.1 euros per megawatt-hour, also
heading for this month’s highest.  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)   declined 13 percent to 444
koruna, after earlier slumping as much as 18 percent, the most
in three years. The Austrian lender said it won’t pay a dividend
this year as it expects to post a loss after writedowns on its
Hungarian and Romanian units.  Orco Property Group (ORC)  SA increased 7.5 percent, the
most in almost two months, to 94.5 koruna. The Czech developer
said it plans to sell its Sky Office tower in Dusseldorf this
year and confirmed its full-year revenue forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
