Dexia SA (DEXB)  said its short-term funding
needs will be cut by 14 billion euros by the sale of its Belgian
consumer-lending unit.  The sale “will enable the Dexia Group to reduce its short-
term funding requirement by more than 14 billion euros, to
improve the group’s solvency by more than 200 basis points and
to reduce its portfolio of non-strategic assets by 18 billion
euros,” Dexia said today in an e-mailed statement. The deal
will “be finalized in the very near future,” it said.  “Based on the numbers on 30 June 2011, this transaction
would have led to a 155 billion-euro decrease of the balance
sheet and a 42 billion-euro reduction of the weighted risks,”
Dexia said. “It would have resulted in a loss of around 3.8
billion euros and a simultaneous decrease of the AFS reserve of
2.2 billion euros.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
