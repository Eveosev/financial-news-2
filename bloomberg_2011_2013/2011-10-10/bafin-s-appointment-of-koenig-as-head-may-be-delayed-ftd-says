The planned appointment of Elke
Koenig as the head of German financial regulator BaFin may be
delayed, Financial Times Deutschland reported, without saying
where it got the information.  Koenig isn’t likely to be named the successor of Jochen
Sanio by the end of the year because of legal changes required
to fulfill her pay request, the newspaper reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
