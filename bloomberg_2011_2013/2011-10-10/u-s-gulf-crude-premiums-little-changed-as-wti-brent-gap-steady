U.S. Gulf crude premiums increased
as the discount for West Texas Intermediate versus Brent
widened.  The gap between WTI and Brent November contracts increased
38 cents to $23.28 a barrel in  New York . The spread settled
Sept. 6 at a record margin of $26.87.  When Brent increases versus WTI, it strengthens the value
of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil
priced against the European benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened 85 cents to
$27.25 a barrel at 2:01 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet gained 25 cents to
$26.75.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend grew 20 cents to $23.20 a barrel while Poseidon
strengthened 35 cents to $22.75 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium increased 75 cents to
$21.75 a barrel and West Texas Sour’s discount was unchanged at
80 cents a barrel below WTI. Thunder Horse’s premium increased
50 cents to $26.10 above the benchmark.  The premium for Syncrude slipped 5 cents to $8.80 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
tar sands in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select increased 90 cents
to $10.80 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
