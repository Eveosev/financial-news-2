(Corrects source of report in headline.)  At least 24 elephants were killed by
poachers in the first half of this year in the Niassa Reserve,
 Mozambique â€™s largest conservation area, Radio Mocambique
reported, citing Augusto Chalamanga, head of a delegation of
parliamentarians who recently visited the park.  The national police service will be sending officials to
protect the animals in the reserve, which covers 42,000 square
kilometres (16,216 square miles), the Maputo-based broadcaster
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
