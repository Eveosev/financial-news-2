Shell Pension Fund, which runs
pension plans for  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  companies, joined an
appeal of a court ruling in the Bernard Madoff case that denied
customer status to so-called feeder fund investors.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  Burton Lifland  backed the liquidator
of the con man’s firm in June, saying investors in feeders can’t
file claims for payment with the estate because they didn’t have
accounts with the Madoff firm in their own names. More than 50
companies, pension funds and individuals -- from  National Bank
of Kuwait (NBK)  SAK and  Aozora Bank Ltd. (8304)  to Upstate New York Bakery
Drivers & Industry Pension Fund -- appealed the ruling, asking a
district judge to decide whether Lifland erred in defining what
a customer was.  “The claimants met the statutory definition of ‘customer’
and entrusted their investment funds to the insolvent
broker/dealer for investment through intermediaries,” they said
in a court filing last week. A copy of Shell’s joinder in the
appeal was filed Oct. 7 in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Manhattan.  Shell Pension Fund had assets of 17.4 billion euros in
2010, according to its website. Shell Pension Fund may have lost
about $45 million as a result of its indirect exposure to the
Ponzi scheme, Royal Dutch Shell said after Madoff’s 2008 arrest.  The Madoff bankruptcy case is Securities Investor
Protection Corp. v. Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities
Inc., 08-01789, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
