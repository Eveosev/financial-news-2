Gunvor Group Ltd. estimates revenue
will increase 23 percent to $80 billion this year, co-founder
and Chief Executive Officer Torbjorn Tornqvist told  Vedomosti  in
an interview that was confirmed by spokesman Anton Kurevin.  Gunvor has not received any “administrative” support from
the Russian government to build its energy trading operations,
Tornqvist said. The commodity trader’s other founder,  Gennady Timchenko , hasn’t used his acquaintance with Prime Minister
 Vladimir Putin  to advance the business, according to the
interview.  Gunvor will seek to expand via acquisitions, about half of
which will be focused in Russia, Tornqvist said.  The trader sees coal demand growing faster than oil demand
in the next 20 years, especially in Russia’s Far East, he said.
Gunvor also plans to develop grain, sugar and ethanol trading,
he said. The trader said in July it will join the Kolmar coal
project in eastern Siberia after funding the purchase of a 51
percent stake with a loan convertible into equity.  Gunvor’s revenue last year was $65 billion, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
