Production of refined sugar from
beets in Ukraine increased by 35 percent as of Oct. 7 to 613,230
metric tons, from 454,020 tons a year earlier, said Ukrtsukor,
the country’s producers’ union.  Seventy-two plants were refining sugar compared with 62
last year, Kiev-based Ukrtsukor said in an e-mailed statement.
Refineries received 6.64 million tons of beets, of which they
processed 5.13 million tons.  Farmers harvested 9.29 million tons of beets from 265,200
hectares (655,044 acres), which equates to almost half the
planted area, Ukrtsukor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
