The  United Arab Emirates  may set a
value-added tax of 5 percent as part of a regional plan, the
 Finance Ministry ’s Younis Haji Al Khouri said in Dubai today.  The process is still in “its early stages” as the U.A.E.
just completed a study on the effects of the VAT both socially
and economically, undersecretary of the Ministry of Finance Al
Khouri said in an interview.  It will take three years to fully implement the tax from
the time its general principles are agreed upon collectively
with the Gulf Cooperation Council, he said. The implementation
will take place “beyond 2013,” he said.  The U.A.E. will announce its federal budget for the year
tomorrow with a “slight deficit but lower than last year” and
“much better forecasted revenue,” Al Khouri said, without
disclosing details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
