Hog prices fell the most in more
than two weeks on signs of increasing U.S. pork supplies. Cattle
futures dropped.  U.S. meatpackers processed 2.34 million hogs in the week
through Oct. 8, up 4 percent from the prior week, government
data show. Carcasses averaged 205.47 pounds (93.2 kilograms) on
Sept. 30, a 16-week high, according to the Department of
Agriculture. Weights may rise further because fresh corn will be
available for livestock feed as the U.S. harvest progresses,
said Jason Golly, a vice president of risk-management marketing
at Lynch Livestock Inc.  “We can’t keep going through these big Saturday kills like
this,” Golly said in a telephone interview from Waucoma,  Iowa .
“There’s concern seasonally that we’re topping this market out.
These hogs are going to get new corn, which really puts on
weight.”  Hog futures for December settlement dropped 1.8 percent to
settle at 87.75 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, the biggest loss for the most-active
contract since Sept. 22. The commodity has gained 10 percent
this year.  Spot-market hog prices fell 0.5 percent to 92.85 cents a
pound on Oct. 7, the first drop in seven sessions, USDA data
show. Prices are down 11 percent from $1.0408 reached on Aug. 4,
which was the highest since at least April 2003. Wholesale-pork
prices lost 0.4 percent to 97.65 cents a pound last week, the
first decline in a month, the USDA said.  Cattle futures for December delivery declined 1.2 percent
to settle at $1.2035 a pound in  Chicago  after reaching $1.2025,
the lowest since Sept. 30. The price has climbed 11 percent this
year.  Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement rose 0.5
percent to $1.43125 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
