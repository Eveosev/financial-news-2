Bouygues SA (EN)  shareholders approved a
plan to buy back as much as 1.25 billion euros ($1.7 billion) of
the French construction company’s own stocks in a bid to boost
shares that have lost a fifth of their value this year.  The Paris-based company is offering 30 euros for each
share, to buy as much as 11.7 percent of the company stocks. The
move may boost 2011 earnings per share by about 11 percent if
the full amount is repurchased, Bouygues said when it presented
the offer on Aug. 31. Bouygues shares traded as high as 25.79
euros in Paris today.  The builder, which also controls 90 percent of  France ’s
third-largest mobile-phone operator, 43 percent of television
broadcaster TF1 and 30 percent of the train- and power-equipment
maker Alstom SA, had no better investment options within the
framework of its “very prudent financial management policy”
than to buy back stock, Chief Executive Officer Martin Bouygues
said on Aug. 31.  Standard and Poor’s said on Sept. 1 it may cut Bouygues’s
“A-” credit rating, citing a “less conservative” financial
policy and an expected drop in free cash flow generation in the
next 12 months because of an increase in  capital expenditures 
such as the purchase of new wireless spectrum being auction in
France.  SCDM, the family holding that owns 18.1 percent of Bouygues
shares, won’t tender its shares at the offer, Martin Bouygues
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
