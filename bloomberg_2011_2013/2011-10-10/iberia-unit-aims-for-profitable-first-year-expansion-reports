Spanish airline Iberia’s new lower-
cost unit aims to be profitable in its first year,  Expansion 
reported, citing an interview with Chief Executive Officer
Rafael Sanchez-Lozano.  The new airline, which doesn’t have a forecast for 2012
revenue, may be profitable, or nearly so, in the first six
months after starting operations, according to Sanchez-Lozano,
the newspaper said.  The executive said parent company International
Consolidated Airlines Group SA will study any profitable project
for a potential acquisition, including TAP and BMI, Expansion
