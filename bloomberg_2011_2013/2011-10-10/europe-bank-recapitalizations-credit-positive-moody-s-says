European bank recapitalizations are
“credit positive,” Moody’s Investors Service said.  The benefits will be limited, Moody’s said today in its
Weekly Credit Outlook.  “Any recapitalization initiative will not address the
underlying driver of  Europe ’s bank crisis,” the report said.
“It is unlikely to achieve more than a temporary respite from
banks’ sovereign debt woes and we expect investor sentiment to
remain fragile.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
