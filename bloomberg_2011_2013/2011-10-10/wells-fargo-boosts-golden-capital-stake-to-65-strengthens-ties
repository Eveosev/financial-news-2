Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the fourth-
largest U.S. bank by assets, increased a stake in Golden Capital
Management to 65 percent as it boosts ties with the  Charlotte ,
North Carolina-based investment firm.  Golden Capital is taking on members of Wells Capital
Management’s Boston-based global strategic-products team in a
deal that gives the firm access to more advisory clients and
expands assets under management to $6.2 billion, the companies
said today in statement distributed by  Business Wire . Wells
Fargo, which has held an interest in Golden Capital since 2005,
increased the stake from 45 percent, said Amy George, a
spokeswoman for the San Francisco-based bank.  Amit Chandra, a member of the strategic-products team, will
serve on Golden Capital’s management committee and oversee its
new Boston office, according to the statement. The firm provides
investment-management services to institutional and high-net-
worth clients, combining research with quantitative execution,
according to its  website .  The deal “strengthens our investment capabilities by
leveraging broader resources, talents and ideas,” Golden
Capital Chief Executive Officer Greg Golden said in the
statement.  George declined to comment in a phone interview on the size
of the deal in dollar terms. The transaction closed Oct. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
