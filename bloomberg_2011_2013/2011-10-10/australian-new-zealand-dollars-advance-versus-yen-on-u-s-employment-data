The Australian and New Zealand
dollars advanced against the yen after a report showed U.S.
payrolls rose in September by more than economists forecast,
boosting demand for higher-yielding assets. The so-called Aussie
climbed to 0.4 percent from last week to 75.26 yen, while the
kiwi advanced 0.5 percent to 59.31 yen.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
