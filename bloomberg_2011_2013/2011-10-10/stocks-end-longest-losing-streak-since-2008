The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose
above its 50-day average for the first time since July, ending
its longest streak below the threshold since 2008 and sending a
bullish sign to some analysts who study charts.  The benchmark gauge for U.S. equities rallied 3.4 percent
to 1,194.89 today, surpassing 1,176, its average level during
the past 50 days. The index spent the previous 52 days below the
average, surpassing the 48-day stretch from May to July of last
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The index’s gain above its 50-day moving average
“reinforces the case that an intermediate, multi-week to multi-
month low is now in place,” Robert Sluymer, New York-based
managing director of U.S. technical research at RBC Capital
Markets Corp., said in a telephone interview.  Concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis will drive the global
economy into a recession pushed the S&P 500 down as much as 19
percent from its 2011 peak on April 29, posing the biggest
challenge to the  bull market  that began in 2009. The index
closed below 1,100 for the first time in more than a year on
Oct. 3, falling below the range that held since August and
putting the gauge within 1 percent of a bear-market drop of 20
percent from its April peak.  The S&P 500 has risen 8.7 percent since its 2011 low on
Oct. 3, the biggest rally over five days since March 2009, amid
growing optimism Europe will tame its debt crisis and after
reports showed American payrolls increased more than economists
forecast in September and manufacturing unexpectedly
accelerated.  VIX Below Average  As stocks rebound, the cost of using options as insurance
against drops in the  S&P 500  fell. The Chicago Board Options
Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX, is below its 50-day average
for the first time since July 22, Bloomberg data showed. The
volatility gauge on Aug. 8 closed at a 29-month high of 48.  The S&P 500 remained under its 50-day moving average for 72
days ended Dec. 15, 2008, Bloomberg data show. The index sank to
a 12-year low three months later before surging as much as 102
percent to a three-year high on April 29.  Christopher Verrone, head of technical analysis at New
York-based Strategas Research Partners, said the S&P 500 faces
“resistance” at 1,230, a level it hasn’t seen since Aug. 3  As for the 50-day average, “It’s important we got through
it, given that we haven’t been able to over the last number of
weeks,” Verrone said in a telephone interview. “But more
important is the 1,230 range, where there is a lot of overhead
supply. I’d be more impressed if we got through that range.”  While the S&P 500’s advance above its 50-day moving average
is a positive sign, it’s important that the slope of the average
turns upward, Sluymer said. The 50-day average peaked at
1,331.39 on June 3 and has been falling since, according to
Bloomberg data.  “It takes time for an uptrend developing,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
