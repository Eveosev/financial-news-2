India ’s 10-year bonds fell the most
in almost two years after underwriters had to pick up government
debt that went unsold at an auction last week, fueling
speculation demand for the notes is waning.  Yields jumped to the highest level since August 2008 after
the central bank asked primary dealers to purchase the remaining
8.99 billion rupees ($184 million) of the 150 billion rupees of
debt offered on Oct. 7, according to a statement from the
 Reserve Bank of India . Rates have surged 40 basis points since
the government said Sept. 29 that it will borrow 32 percent more
than earlier planned in the six months ending March 31.  “The auction results indicate that investors were probably
demanding higher yields as heavy supplies are damping demand,”
said Roy Paul, a Mumbai-based deputy general manager of treasury
at Federal Bank Ltd.  The yield on the 7.8 percent securities due April 2021 rose
17 basis points, or 0.17 percentage point, to 8.75 percent as of
the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s
trading system. That’s the biggest increase since November 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. There was no trading in
the notes on Oct. 7 due to half-yearly coupon payments, while
Oct. 6 was a national holiday.  The  Reserve Bank  sold bonds due in 2017, 2022, 2027 and
2040 last week, the first issuance for the second half of the
fiscal year that ends March 31. Primary dealers bought 1.93
billion rupees of the 2027 notes and 7.06 billion rupees of the
2040 securities at the auctions, the central bank said.  Further Declines Forecast  Ten-year bonds will extend five quarters of losses, pushing
yields to a three-year high of 9 percent by the end of 2011, as
the government increases debt sales, according to Morgan
Stanley.  The Reserve Bank of India may reduce the  cash reserve ratio 
for banks and purchase sovereign bonds to inject money into the
financial system as government borrowings drain funds, Pieter Van Der Schaft, Hong Kong-based head of Asian interest-rate
strategy at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a research note published
today.  The  finance ministry  will sell a record 4.7 trillion rupees
of securities in the year ending March 2012, compared with an
earlier estimate of 4.17 trillion rupees, R. Gopalan, secretary
of the Department of Economic Affairs, said last month.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
rose 15 basis points to 8.09 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
