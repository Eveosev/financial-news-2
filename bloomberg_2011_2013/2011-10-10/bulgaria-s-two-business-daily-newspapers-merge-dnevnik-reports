Bulgaria’s two biggest business
daily newspapers Dnevnik and Pari merged to form Capital Daily,
 Dnevnik  reported, citing Lilia Apostolova, executive director of
Economedia publishing house.  Bonnier AB, the family-owned Swedish media company, which
published Pari, set up a “strategic partnership” in September
with Economedia, the publisher of Dnevnik and Capital weekly,
according to Dnevnik. Pari is now being published by Economedia
until the two newspapers are fully merged next month into
Capital Daily, the newspaper said.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
