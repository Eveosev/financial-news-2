Oppenheimer & Co.,  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) 
and Barclays Plc cut estimates for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index, citing Europe’s debt crisis and U.S. budget battles.  Brian Belski , chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer,
cut his year-end 2012 forecast for the benchmark equity gauge to
1,400 from 1,475 and his profit forecast for next year to $101 a
share from $112. He also lifted his projection for earnings this
year to $96 from $94.  Garry Evans , head of global equity
strategy at HSBC, slashed his prediction for the  S&P 500 ’s close
in 2011 by 21 percent to 1,130. Barclays’s Barry Knapp reduced
his 2011 forecast for the index to 1,260 from 1,326 and his 2012
earnings estimate to $102 from $105.  “Against a backdrop of slowing global growth, ongoing
sovereign debt issues in  Europe , uncertainty regarding U.S.
fiscal and regulatory policies and anemic labor market growth,
the market is likely to struggle for longer-term gains,” New
York-based Belski wrote in a note dated Oct. 7.  Concern European officials will fail to contain the
region’s debt crisis and the global economy will slip into a
recession has wiped about $10 trillion from world equity
markets. The S&P 500 fell below 1,100 for the first time in more
than a year last week, sending the measure within 1 percent of a
 bear market , and climbed 3.4 percent to 1,194.89 today. U.S.
stocks are trading at about 13 times earnings, close to the
lowest levels since March 2009.  ‘Continue to Fret’  “It is not clear the world is going into recession but
markets will continue to fret about this,” Hong Kong-based
Evans wrote in a note. “In this environment, catalysts will
matter more than valuations.”  A team at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney lowered its
recommendations for riskier holdings while boosting ratings for
assets considered “safe havens” such as bonds and cash. A team
led by Chief Investment Officer Jeff Applegate and Chief
Investment Strategist  David Darst  cut their ratings for global
equities to “underweight” from “overweight’, citing the
increasing risk of a recession in the U.S. and the rest of the
developed world.  ‘‘This is the most significant change to our tactical asset
allocation in more than two years, as we are decisively moving
to bearish from bullish,’’ the Morgan Stanley note said. ‘‘The
primary source of the recent financial market distress -- with,
we think, more to come -- has been a combination of policy
inaction and ineptness in the U.S. and Europe.’’  The firm also lowered its recommendations for commodities
and real estate investment trusts to ‘‘underweight’’ from
‘‘overweight,’’ while raising bonds to ‘‘marketweight’’ from
‘‘underweight’’ and cash to ‘‘overweight’’ from ‘‘underweight.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
