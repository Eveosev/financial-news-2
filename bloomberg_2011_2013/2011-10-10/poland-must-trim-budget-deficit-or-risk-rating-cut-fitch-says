Poland must reduce its  budget
deficit  or face a possible rating cut in the “medium term,”
 David Riley , head of sovereign ratings at Fitch Ratings, said
today.  The government is going to have to enact “quite a strong
austerity program” to cut its deficit as the European debt
crisis means Poland will probably miss its economic growth
targets, London-based Riley said in an interview.  “There is a potential danger to its sovereign  credit
rating ,” Riley said. “We think they will stabilize the debt
level and bring down the deficit, but if they fail to do so or
significantly miss their targets for next year or the year
after, then I think there would be downward pressure on the
Polish rating.”  Fitch rates  Poland  A-, its fourth-lowest investment grade,
with a stable outlook.  The government of Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, which
won yesterday’s general election, pledged to narrow the deficit
to 2.9 percent of gross domestic product next year, counting on
4 percent economic growth to boost revenue.  The election result may be positive for Poland’s economy if
it delivers policy continuity, Riley said.  “If it’s broadly speaking similar to the outgoing
administration then I think that will give us a little bit more
confidence, and investors some confidence, that the process of
reducing the budget deficit and stabilizing public debt will be
undertaken,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
