Oman may introduce Islamic
instruments in early 2012 as it’s working on developing a
framework for Shariah-compliant products, the Persian Gulf
country’s market regulator said today.  The instruction to start Islamic banks in the sultanate has
facilitated the introduction of the services, which “will
create new challenges in rethinking our legislations and
amending them to accommodate Islamic products,” Oman Capital
Markets Authority President Yahya Said Al Jabri said in a speech
in Muscat today. “This task requires education and training of
human resources able to assimilate this promising industry.”  The introduction of Islamic instruments will be helpful for
the expansion of the securities market, Al Jabri said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
