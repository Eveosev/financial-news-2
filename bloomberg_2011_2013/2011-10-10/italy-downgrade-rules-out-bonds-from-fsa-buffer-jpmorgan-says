Italy’s credit downgrade by  Fitch
Ratings  means the bonds will no longer be eligible for inclusion
in the liquidity asset buffer required by the U.K. Financial
Services Authority, JPMorgan Chase & Co. said.  “The FSA requires from certain firms, including branches
of foreign banks, to hold a liquidity buffer of high-quality,
unencumbered assets with credit rating of AA or above,”
Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a global-markets strategist in  London ,
wrote in an investor report on Oct. 7. “Belgium is the obvious
beneficiary, as it is the next cheapest paper that can be used
for the FSA’s liquidity buffer. The impact should be limited, as
bank treasuries have been largely anticipating this downgrade.”  Fitch cut Italy’s credit rating to A+ from AA- on Oct. 7.
