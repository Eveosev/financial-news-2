European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  said  Europe ’s debt crisis now threatens the
region’s financial system as officials race to put together a
new plan to end the turmoil.  “The crisis has reached a systemic dimension,” Trichet
told lawmakers in Brussels today in his capacity as head of the
European Systemic Risk Board. “Sovereign stress has moved from
smaller economies to some of the larger countries. The crisis is
systemic and must be tackled decisively.”  European leaders are trying to shore up the region’s banks
as they debate how best to manage the fallout from any Greek
default. Governments yesterday pushed back a summit amid
opposition to  Germany ’s drive for deeper-than-planned Greek bond
writedowns that Luxembourg’s Jean-Claude Juncker says may exceed
60 percent.  Germany and France, Europe’s dominant tandem, this week
pledged a  crisis-management  breakthrough by early November.  “Time is always of the essence when you have to be in a
mode of crisis management,” said Trichet.  Officials are also debating how to magnify the firepower of
the euro region’s bailout plan, with ECB Vice President  Vitor Constancio  signalling yesterday that it should be done using
government guarantees rather than the central bank’s market
operations.  “We don’t consider it appropriate for us to leverage the
EFSF,” said Trichet today, stressing that the comment was in
his capacity as ECB president.  To contact the reporters on this story:
