Iranian authorities have set the
dates for reviewing the suitability of politicians before
allowing them to run for parliament on March 2, a practice that
in 2008 led to the initial rejection of about a third of the
candidates, including those deemed to lack Islamic values.  Their backgrounds will be assessed by authorities between
Dec. 31 and Jan. 9 to ensure they are suitable to participate in
the contest, with a weeklong campaign starting Feb. 23, the
state-run  Mehr  news agency cited Mohammad-Najjar as saying today
in Tehran. Politicians may register to run beginning Dec. 24,
Solat Mortazavi, head of the elections headquarters, was cited
yesterday as saying by state media.  In 2008, the Interior Ministry approved about 5,000
candidates to run in parliamentary elections in the Shiite
Muslim-led nation, following the rejection by the Council of
Guardians of almost a third of those who had applied.  Reasons for disqualifying applicants included
“undertakings against the Islamic Republic,” a “lack of
belief in Islamic values,” ties to foreign intelligence
services and links to former Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, the
ministry said at the time. The majority of the seats in the 2008
elections were won by religious factions, including supporters
of President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .  To contact the reporter on this story:
