The European Commission is planning
a so-called counter-cyclical premium for insurers,  Financial
Times Deutschland  reported, without saying where it obtained the
information.  The premium would reduce the need for loss provisions amid
a decline in value of sovereign bonds, the newspaper said. The
clause would also water down the rules of Solvency II, the
proposed risk-based regulation for insurers in  Europe , according
to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
