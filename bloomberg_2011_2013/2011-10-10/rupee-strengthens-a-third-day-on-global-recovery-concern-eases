India ’s rupee advanced for a third
day as improved economic data from the U.S. eased concern the
global recovery is faltering.  The currency rose to the highest level in more than a week
and the BSE India Sensitive Index of shares climbed 2 percent.
American employers added 103,000 workers in September, after a
revised 57,000 in the prior month, according to a Labor
Department report on Oct. 7. That exceeded the median forecast
of analysts in a Bloomberg survey for an increase of 60,000.  “The positive data from the U.S. is encouraging and may be
a signal of some return of stability to the global economy,”
said  Roy Paul , a Mumbai-based deputy general manager of treasury
at Federal Bank Ltd. “That is spurring some buying of the local
currency.”  The rupee strengthened 0.4 percent to 48.9775 per dollar as
of the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It earlier touched 48.8950, the strongest level since
Sept. 29.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 49.55 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations for a
rate of 49.75 on Oct. 7. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
