Samsung Electronics Co. advanced as
much as 2.3 percent in Seoul trading after Daewoo Securities Co.
and HI Investment & Securities Co. raised their share-price
estimates and earnings estimates.  Asia â€™s biggest maker of chips,
flat screens and mobile phones climbed to 879,000 won as of 9:41
a.m. on the Korea Exchange. The benchmark Kospi Index gained 0.7
percent. Samsung reported better-than-expected profit on Oct. 7
after demand for Galaxy smartphones outweighed slumping sales of
displays and semiconductors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
