Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the world’s
biggest state-owned oil company, will supply full contractual
crude volumes to Asian buyers in November, according to two
regional refiners who received notification from the producer.  Saudi Aramco, as the company is known, will provide 100
percent of supplies sold under long-term contracts for a 24th
month, according to the refiners, who declined to be identified,
citing confidentiality agreements with the  Middle East ’s biggest
producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
