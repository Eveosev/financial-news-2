India ’s 10-year bonds will extend
five quarters of losses, pushing yields to a three-year high of
9 percent by the end of 2011, as the government increases debt
sales, according to Morgan Stanley.  The  Reserve Bank  of India may reduce the  cash reserve ratio 
for banks and purchase sovereign bonds to inject money into the
financial system as government borrowings drain funds, Pieter
Van Der Schaft, Hong Kong-based head of Asian interest-rate
strategy at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a research note published
today.  The yield on the 7.8 percent note due April 2021 jumped 14
basis points, or 0.14 percentage point, to 8.71 percent as of
11:33 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. It rose to 8.72 percent earlier, the highest level for
benchmark 10-year rates since August 2008, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
