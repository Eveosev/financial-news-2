X5 Retail Group NV (FIVE)  slumped the most
in almost a week after the Russian retailer lowered its full
year sales-growth forecast, citing a “rapidly weakening
macroeconomic environment” and the rebranding of its Kopeyka
stores.  The  London  traded shares dropped 8.6 percent to $24.64 by
8:46 a.m., their steepest intraday retreat since Oct. 4.  The company cut its forecast for gross retail sales growth
to about 35 percent from an initial target of 40 percent,
according to a statement today. Third-quarter net retail sales
climbed 32 percent to 105 billion rubles ($3.3 billion), X5
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
