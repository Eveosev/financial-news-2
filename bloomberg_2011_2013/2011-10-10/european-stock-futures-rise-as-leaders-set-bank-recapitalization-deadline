European stock futures advanced,
indicating the Stoxx Europe 600 Index will extend a two-week
gain, after the leaders of Germany and France gave themselves
three weeks to create a plan to recapitalize banks. U.S. stock
futures rose and Asian shares fluctuated.  Premier Oil Plc (PMO)  and Atos SA may climb as analysts increased
their recommendations on the shares.  Dexia SA (DEXB)  may be active
after the Belgian government agreed to buy the local consumer-
lending unit of the bank.  Futures on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, a benchmark for the
euro region, advanced 1 percent to 2,281 at 7:02 a.m. in  London .
Futures on the U.K.â€™s FTSE 100 Index expiring in December gained
0.6 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
