Jordan wants companies to express
interest in developing its oil shale resources, the director
general of the kingdom’s National Resources Authority said.  “We have areas that are now open for exploration and
exploitation,” Mousa Ali Alzyoud said today in an interview in
the capital, Amman.  Jordan has the world’s fourth-largest reserves of oil
shale, a sedimentary rock containing solid bituminous materials
that are released as petroleum-like liquids when the rock is
heated. Alzyoud estimated the deposits at about 40 billion
metric tons.  The government is turning to oil shale as well as nuclear,
solar and wind power to meet increasing electricity demand, and
it hopes to attract $14 billion in investments in energy
infrastructure. Officials plan to increase the share of energy
generated by indigenous oil shale to 14 percent of the country’s
total requirements, Alzyoud said.  “Jordan currently imports 97 percent of its energy needs,
so we have a plan to diversify the sources,” he said.  The Middle East nation has signed three oil shale
concessions so far, including one with  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , he
said. The others are with Estonia’s Eesti Energia AS and  Karak
International Oil , a unit of  Tunbridge Wells , England-based
Jordan Energy and Mining Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
