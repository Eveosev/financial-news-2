The U.K. could save 200 million
pounds ($310 million) a year if it updates rules on military
procurement drawn up in 1968, a review commissioned by Prime
Minister  David Cameron ’s government said today.  David Currie, the former dean of Cass Business School and a
lawmaker in the upper House of Lords who carried out the review,
said revised regulations for Ministry of Defense procurement
from single sources -- where open competition is not possible on
grounds of national security -- should ensure that there is
greater transparency and that cost data are standardized.  “When Defense Minister  Peter Luff  asked me to undertake a
review of the regulations surrounding single-source procurement
of military equipment and services, it quickly became apparent
that they needed to change,” Currie said in an  e-mailed
statement  today. “There are sound reasons why single-source
will continue to represent a significant part of total MOD
procurement. It is thus essential that the governing regime for
this activity is robust and fit for purpose.”  Currie’s review called for a more open relationship between
the London-based ministry and manufacturers, the provision of
incentives for companies to be more efficient and a
simplification of procedures for small businesses. The findings
of the review are now open to public consultation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
