Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis
may return as the head of  Latvia ’s government under a coalition
accord reached today in Riga by three parties that back
austerity measures and adopting the euro.  The three-party alliance will have 56 seats in the 100-
member legislature and will ask President Andris Berzins to name
Dombrovskis for another term in office, said former Latvian
President Valdis Zatlers, who heads the Reform Party that will
be part of the government.  The other parties in the government will be the  National
Alliance  and Dombrovskis’s Unity party. Both Unity and the
Reform party said earlier today they favor reelecting
Dombrovskis. National Alliance didn’t express a preference for
premier.  Since turning to the European Commission and the
 International Monetary Fund  for a 7.5 billion euro ($10.2
billion) loan in 2008, the Baltic country has cut spending and
raised taxes equal to about 16 percent of gross domestic
product. It plans further cuts in next year’s budget to lower
the deficit to 2.5 percent so it can adopt the euro in 2014.  Dombrovskis, 40, would become prime minister for a third
consecutive term if Berzins names him to form the government
again after taking charge in March 2009 when a previous
government fell and was reelected in parliamentary elections
last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
