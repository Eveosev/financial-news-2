Russia  and  Kazakhstan  are in talks
to swap grain to cut transport costs, RIA Novosti reported,
citing Kazakh Agriculture Minister Asylzhan Mamytbekov.  The plan calls for Kazakhstan to export grain produced in
the northern part of the country to eastern Russia, while Russia
would ship grain produced in its southern regions to southern
Kazakhstan, Mamytbekov told lawmakers in the capital Astana
today, the state-run Russian news service said.  Kazakhstan expects to harvest about 23 million metric tons
of grain this year, the most in 60 years, RIA reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
