Clessidra Sgr, a private-equity
fund, is ready to invest part of its 1.2 billion euros ($1.6
billion) in potential liquidity in the local utilities that
 Italy  may privatize, la Repubblica reported, citing an interview
with the fund’s Chief Executive Officer Claudio Sposito.  “We can invest a lot,” Rome-based Repubblica cited
Sposito as saying. “When the privatizations begin we will
definitely be among the interested parties.”  Private-equity funds "may have a role in helping banks in
the period of recapitalization,’’ the newspaper cited the fund’s
chief as saying.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
