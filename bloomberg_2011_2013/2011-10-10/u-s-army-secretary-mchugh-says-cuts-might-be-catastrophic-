U.S. Army Secretary John McHugh said
defense budget cuts beyond about $450 billion planned over the
next decade would “be catastrophic.”  McHugh spoke during a press conference at the annual
conference of the Association of the United States Army in
 Washington .  General Raymond Odierno, the Army’s chief of staff, said
even the current level of planned cuts was “very, very
difficult” and would mean shrinking the number of active-duty
soldiers below 520,000.  Odierno said he was “deathly afraid” of what would happen
if the congressional supercommittee fails to produce a deficit
reduction package and a round of automatic cuts are triggered
under the law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
