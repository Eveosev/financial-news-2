Colfax Corp. (CFX) , a U.S. manufacturer
that has made a 1.5 billion-pound ($2.4 billion) offer for
 Charter International Plc (CHTR) , a U.K. engineering company, faces
demands from a trade union and a member of parliament that it
make clear its plans for cost-cutting, the Financial Times
reported.  Jim Scullion, who represents the Unite union at Charter’s
site in west  Scotland , said the company will be 1 billion pounds
in debt and there has been no promise of  job security , the
newspaper reported.  Jim Sheridan, the Labour MP for Paisley and Renfrewshire
North, demanded that Colfax produce a “clear and detailed
plan” for Charter’s future, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
