Russian sales of new cars and light
commercial vehicles rose 26 percent in September to 235,552
units from a year earlier, the Association of European
Businesses in Moscow said.  Among the top ten bestselling models of passenger cars nine
are produced in  Russia , the AEB said today in an e-mailed
statement.  Carmakers have benefited from a rebate program to stimulate
demand for new vehicles produced in Russia in the first half of
this year. In July, the government said it had distributed the
final 600,000 certificates in its so-called cash-for-clunkers
rebate program. The program helped sales rise 30 percent last
year, according to the AEB.  “The 26 percent increase for the month of September is in
line with our expectations of a slowing but still strong growth
for the remainder of 2011,”  David Thomas , chairman of the AEB
Automobile Manufactures Committee, said in the statement.“The
full year forecast of 2.45 million cars and light commercial
vehicles looks very achievable and the market prospects for the
final quarter remain very positive with much approved credit
availability and robust  consumer confidence .”  Sales growth stalled at Tolyatti-based AvtoVAZ, Russia’s
largest carmaker, whose Lada-brand cars had gained from the
rebate program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
