Mexico ’s peso rose to the strongest
level in more than two weeks as oil gained and French and German
leaders pledged to present a European bank recapitalization
plan, damping concern the global economy will fall into
recession.  The peso advanced 1.7 percent to 13.2374 per U.S. dollar at
4 p.m. Mexico City time, from 13.4598 on Oct. 7. It earlier
touched 13.2257, the strongest since Sept. 21. The currency has
dropped 6.8 percent this year.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  said yesterday they will deliver a plan to
recapitalize European banks and address the Greek debt crisis by
the Nov. 3 Group of 20 summit. Oil, Mexico’s second-biggest
export, climbed 2.8 percent in New York.  “You’ve got a rally in commodities for four days in a
row,”  Marc Chandler , global head of currency strategy at  Brown
Brothers  in New York, said in a phone interview. The backdrop
behind the peso’s rise is the economic outlook in “not just
Europe, but also better growth from the U.S.,” he said.  Employers in the U.S., the destination of about 80 percent
of Mexico’s exports, added more jobs than forecast in September,
Labor Department data showed Oct. 7.  The yield on Mexico’s benchmark peso-denominated bonds due
in 2024 fell eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to
6.64 percent, according to data from Banco Santander SA. The
price of the securities rose 0.80 centavo to 129.44 centavos per
peso.  Traders didn’t trigger any of the dollar options available
today, the central bank said on its website. The central bank
has been buying as much as $600 million through the options
every month since March 2010 to bolster foreign reserves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
