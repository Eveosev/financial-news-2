The Northeastern U.S. is expected to
remain warmer than normal through the middle of October,
Commodity Weather Group President  Matt Rogers  said after a day
of record and near-record heat from Pennsylvania to Maine.  Rogers’s 6- to 10-day forecast covering Oct. 15 to Oct. 19
predicts the Northeast will be about 3 degrees above normal,
with the northern New England states of Maine,  New Hampshire  and
Vermont even warmer.  Traders use long-range temperature predictions to gauge
energy use and market fluctuations. Hot or cold weather can
increase demand for heating and cooling, and power plants use
about 30 percent of the nation’s gas supplies, according to
Energy Department data.  The high temperature in  New York ’s Central Park yesterday
was 84 degrees Fahrenheit (29 Celsius), two degrees below the
record for the day set 1916, according to the  National Weather
Service . The normal high for Oct. 9 is 66 degrees.  The high in  Boston  was 87, a record for the day, passing a
mark set in 1942.  A new high of 85 was set yesterday in  Portland , Maine,
besting the record of 79 in 1943, according to the weather
service. Philadelphia reached 85, one below the record.  In his 11- to 15-day outlook for Oct. 20 to Oct. 24, Rogers
predicts the warmth will shift westward into the center of the
U.S. with the Northeast becoming more seasonal and the highest
temperatures centered on Colorado.  To contact the reporter on this story:
