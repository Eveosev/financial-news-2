MRV Engenharia & Participacoes SA,
 Brazil ’s fourth-biggest homebuilder by revenue, rose to a three-
week high after it was raised to “overweight” from “equal-
weight” at Morgan Stanley.  Shares advanced 4.7 percent to 10.57 reais at the close of
trading, the highest since Sept. 21. The benchmark Bovespa index
gained 4 percent.  MRV’s focus on low-income housing “is an advantage
compared to other homebuilders in a slowdown scenario,” Morgan
Stanley’s analyst Rafael Pinho wrote in a note to clients today.
“Low-income clients do not postpone the purchasing decision if
financing fits their pocket and unemployment remains low, which
we believe is likely to be the case going forward.”  Morgan Stanley has a 12-month estimate of 14.6 reais for
the stock.  Rival  Cyrela Brazil Realty SA Empreendimentos e
Participacoes (CYRE3) , the country’s second-largest homebuilder, gained
5.4 percent to 12.51 reais, the most since Aug. 29, after Morgan
Stanley boosted its recommendation to “equal-weight” from
“underweight.” Concerns about the company’s profit margins are
“fairly priced-in at current levels,” according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
