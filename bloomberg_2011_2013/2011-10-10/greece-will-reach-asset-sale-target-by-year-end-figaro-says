Greece  will reach its target of
raising 4 billion euros ($5.39 billion) through privatization
before the end of the year,  Le Figaro  reported, citing
Development, Competitiveness and Shipping Minister Michalis Chrisochoides.  The country wants to get good value for the assets and not
sell them quickly at low prices in a “fire sale,” the
newspaper cited the minister as saying. Chrisochoides will be
visiting France this week and meeting French Finance Minister
 Francois Baroin  as well as representatives of companies
including Electricite de France SA,  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA and Veola
Environnement SA, according to the report.  Greece wants guarantees on jobs and investment when selling
the assets, he was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
