Allos Therapeutics Inc. (ALTH) , a cancer
drugmaker that received a takeover offer from  AMAG
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (AMAG) , dropped to a record low after saying a
second bid by a rival company was withdrawn.  Allos, based in Westminster,  Colorado , fell 18 percent to
$1.43 in  New York , the lowest price since the stock began
trading in March 2000. The shares have fallen 69 percent in the
past year.  Allos is working with Lexington, Massachusetts-based AMAG
to complete the all-stock acquisition valued at $686 million, or
$2.44 a share, when the deal was announced in July, the company
said in a statement today. It’s now valued at about $1.73 after
declines in AMAG’s share price.  A rival pharmaceutical company that originally offered $2 a
share, and boosted the bid to $2.20 a share in cash and stock on
Sept. 21, sent a letter to Allos on Oct. 7 withdrawing the
revised offer.  Allos is no longer in discussions or negotiations with the
company, it said in the statement. Allos’s only product,
 Folotyn , is an intravenous treatment for T-cell lymphoma, a type
of blood cancer. Allos sold $35.2 million of Folotyn in 2010,
less than analyst forecasts of about $49.6 million, said Carol
Werther, an analyst at Summer Street Research in  Boston , in a
July 21 note to clients.  Under the terms of AMAG’s offer, Allos investors are slated
to receive 0.1282 share of AMAG for each Allos share they own.  To contact the reporter on this story:
