The following table is a historical
summary of Central Bank of  Sri Lanka ’s monetary policy decisions.  The central bank targets the repurchase rate at which it
drains money from the banking systems.  Note: The  Central Bank ’s Repo and Reverse Repo rates form an  interest rate   corridor for call money market rates. The Repo rate forms the lower  limit while the Reverse Repo rate the upper limit. This reduces large  fluctuations in short-term market rates.
