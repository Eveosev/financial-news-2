Interest-rate derivative users may
have to set aside at least $1.4 trillion in margin payments
under new rules mandated by the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act, according
to research firm Tabb Group.  The costs will come in the next three to five years as
derivatives based on interest-rates such as swaps are required
to be processed by clearinghouses to reduce risk in the $465
trillion market, E. Paul Rowady, a TABB senior analyst, said in
a report today. Clearinghouses collect daily margin, monitor
prices on trades and help settle defaults. LCH.Clearnet Ltd.,
the world’s largest interest-rate swap clearinghouse, has
processed voluntary bank-to-bank trades since 1999.  “Although dealers have readily adopted clearing for the
most vanilla segment of their OTC derivative portfolios, these
exposures require comparatively little initial margin since they
represent the cream of the proverbial crop,” Rowady said in the
report. For more complex types of rate derivative trades, the
new costs may be prohibitive and lead “to the outright
extinction” of some of these transactions, he said.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Securities and
Exchange Commission are writing the rules now for the swap
market based on last year’s Dodd-Frank Act.  To contact the reporter on this story:
