The ruble climbed for a fourth day
against Bank Rossii’s target dollar-euro basket as investors bet
 Europe ’s debt crisis will be contained, boosting demand for
 Russia ’s exports to the euro area.  The ruble was 1.2 percent stronger at 31.655 per dollar and
rose 0.3 percent to 43.122 versus the euro as of 5:24 p.m. in
Moscow, leaving it up 0.7 percent at 36.8161 against the basket.
Investors pared bets the Russian currency would weaken further,
with non-deliverable forwards showing it at 32.1001 per dollar
in three months.  “I’m positive, I’ve bought a bit of the ruble over the
past few days -- I think it’s one of the currencies that has
underperformed quite substantially,” Sergei Strigo, who helps
manage about $1 billion as head of emerging-market debt at
Amundi Group in  London , said by phone. “If you’re positive on
the Eurozone outcome, the ruble is one of the very good
candidates to outperform the market in the next few months.”  French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  and German Chancellor
Angela Merkel have given themselves three weeks to devise a plan
to recapitalize banks, get  Greece  on the right track and fix
Europe’s economic governance. Oil, Russia’s chief export earner,
rose 1.9 percent to $84.53 per barrel in New York crude futures
trading today. The European Union is Russia’s biggest trading
partner.  “Currently what we’re seeing is a reflection of the better
news globally, and that’s supporting the ruble,” Dmitry Polevoy, chief economist for Russia and  Kazakhstan  at ING Groep
NV in Moscow, said by telephone. “The market is playing the
news from Europe, hoping for bolder decisions from politicians
on the Eurozone debt crisis.”  Russia’s dollar Eurobond due 2020 climbed, pushing the
yield down 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 5.11
percent. The yield on government dollar debt due 2015 declined
25 basis points to 3.95 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
