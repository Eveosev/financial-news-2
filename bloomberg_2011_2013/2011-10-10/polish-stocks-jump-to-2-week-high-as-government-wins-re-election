Polish stocks rose for a fourth day,
with the benchmark index climbing to the highest in more than
two weeks, after partial results showed the government winning a
parliamentary majority in yesterday’s general election.  The WIG20 Index rose 3.4 percent to 2,265.59 at the 5:30
p.m. close in Warsaw, trimming this year’s drop to 17 percent.  Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s Civic Platform won 39.2
percent of the vote, according to official results from 99.5
percent of precincts. Tusk’s coalition with the Polish Peasants
Party, which got 8.4 percent of the vote, is projected to have
234 seats in the 460-seat parliament, the Warsaw-based  Electoral
Commission  said. Zloty bonds rallied as Tusk, set to become the
first re-elected prime minister since communism ended in 1989,
pledged to cut the budget gap that has quadrupled since 2007.  “Investors are cheering for this victory of stability,”
Jaroslaw Antonik, who helps manage the equivalent of $1.7
billion at Warsaw-based mutual fund KBC TFI SA, said by phone.
“Expectations are that the current policy will be continued,
probably with some deeper reforms.”  PKO Bank Polski SA, Poland’s biggest bank, advanced for a
fourth day, adding 2.6 percent to 34.05 zloty, and Bank Pekao
SA, majority-owned by UniCredit SpA, increased 4.1 percent to
145.7 zloty. PZU SA, the largest insurer by market value in
central  Europe , climbed 4.4 percent to 319.9 zloty.  PBG SA (PBG) , Poland’s third-largest construction company, closed
at the highest level in a month, soaring 8.9 percent to 79.7
zloty, as the company increased its sales forecast by 30 percent
to about 3 billion zloty ($943 million) and earnings before
interest and taxes by 13 percent to about 260 million zloty.  PKN Orlen SA, the country’s biggest oil company, gained 5.7
percent to 36.79 zloty and  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS) , the second-largest
refiner, climbed 5.2 percent to 24.5 zloty. Oil rose for a
fourth day in  New York  as investors bet that fuel demand may
increase after a pledge by European leaders to contain the
region’s sovereign-debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
