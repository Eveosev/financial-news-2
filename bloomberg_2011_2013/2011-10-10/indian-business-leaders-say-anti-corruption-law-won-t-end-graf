A proposed anti-corruption law
pending before  India ’s parliament won’t end the graft that
affects citizens on a daily basis, according to a letter signed
by prominent businessmen.  Following nationwide protests in August in support of a
fast by an anti-corruption campaigner, the government of Prime
Minister Manmohan Singh toughened its proposals. The bill before
lawmakers will create a new body with powers to investigate
bureaucrats, appoint ombudsmen at the state level and prepare
citizens’ charters that would subject ministries to public
scrutiny.  The bill is “only one small but critical step in the
national task of weeding out the plague of corruption” the
letter signed by businessmen including  Wipro Ltd. (WPRO)  Chairman  Azim Premji  and the chairman of  Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) ,
Deepak Parekh, said. On its own it’s “unlikely to have any
significant impact on the day-to-day corruption which is
insidious and demeaning.”  Singh’s administration has been under pressure to tackle
corruption since the arrest and jailing of a cabinet minister
belonging to a regional ally on charges he conspired to award
mobile-phone licenses to ineligible companies during a 2008
sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
