Belgium  is paying 4 billion euros
($5.4 billion) to buy  Dexia SA (DEXB) ’s Belgian retail unit and will
cover about 60 percent of a 90 billion-euro guarantee for the
bank, Belgian Finance Minister  Didier Reynders  said.  Belgium,  France  and Luxembourg agreed to grant a financing
guarantee to Dexia of up to 90 billion euros for 10 years on
financings, bonds and securities, the maturity of which can be
up to 10 years, the Belgian and French governments said today in
a parallel statements. The three governments agreed to spread
the guarantee according to the same scale as in 2008 -- 60.5
percent for Belgium, 36.5 percent for France and 3 percent for
Luxemburg, they said.   The guarantee is “evidence of the substantial efforts made
by the Belgian, French and Luxemburg governments for the benefit
of the financial stability in the euro area,” according to the
statement. The guarantee will help “give new margins of
maneuver to the Dexia group in terms of liquidity and thus
reduce its exposure,” it said.  “The three governments confirm they will take all the
necessary measures to ensure the depositors’ and creditors’
safety,” according to the statement. “They will pay a
particular attention to the rights and interests of the
employees of the group and its subsidiaries so that the
safeguard thereof is guaranteed.”  The new restructuring plan for Dexia, which also includes
measures for its French municipal loan unit and its Luxembourg
operation, “will be submitted to the European Commission and
the competent authorities so that it can be implemented as
quickly as possible,” it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
