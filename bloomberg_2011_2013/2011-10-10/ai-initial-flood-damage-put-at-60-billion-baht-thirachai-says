Thai Finance Minister Thirachai
Phuvanatnaranubala said initial damage caused by the nation’s
floods was about 60 billion baht, and the disaster could reduce
gross domestic product by 0.6 percentage point.  The damage bill is likely to rise, Thirachai said today in
Bangkok. The government’s fiscal stimulus measures will help
support the economy, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
