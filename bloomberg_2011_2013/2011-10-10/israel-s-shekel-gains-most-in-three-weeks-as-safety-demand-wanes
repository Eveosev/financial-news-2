Israel ’s shekel strengthened the
most in more than three weeks and government bonds declined as
rallying stock markets damped demand for safer assets.  The shekel rose as much as 1.3 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since Sept. 15. It was 1.1 percent higher at
3.6771 per dollar at 4:42 p.m. in Tel Aviv as the greenback
weakened against all 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.
The yield on the benchmark 5.5 Mimshal Shiklit bond due January
2022 gained five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 4.62
percent at the 4:30 close. The TA-25 Index soared 4.1 percent,
the biggest increase since April 2009.  “With the markets correcting, we see investors are exiting
from the safehaven of the dollar and moving to other currencies
and stocks,” Dror Sachs, chief trader at First International
 Bank of Israel  Ltd. in Tel Aviv, said by phone.  Global stocks rallied after German and French leaders
pledged to devise a plan to stem the debt crisis in three weeks.
IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index, which tracks the
U.S. currency against those of six major U.S. trading partners
including the euro and yen, slumped the most since December.  Debt Auction  The  Finance Ministry  auctioned 1.55 billion shekels ($422
million) of debt today, including 250 million shekels each of
the benchmark bonds and five-year notes due in August 2016. The
sale of shorter-term bonds was 3.7 times oversubscribed and that
of 10-year notes 3.45 times oversubscribed. The five-year notes
were sold at an average price of 102.95 compared with 102.56 at
last week’s auction.  The yield on inflation-linked bonds due June 2013 rose six
basis points to 1.15 percent. The two-year breakeven rate, which
reflects market expectations for inflation over the period,
jumped nine basis points to 178, implying annual inflation of
1.78 percent. The rate plunged to the lowest since Sept. 15
yesterday after the cabinet approved proposals from a
government-appointed panel to address cost of living complaints.  Two-year  interest-rate  swaps, an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period, were unchanged at 2.68
percent.  “The Bank of Israel will continue to lower the rate,”
David Reznik, a macro analyst at  Bank Leumi  said by telephone.
He predicts another cut this year by 25 basis points and a
possible additional quarter percentage point drop in the first
quarter of 2012.  Bank of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer’s decision to cut
the benchmark interest rate by a quarter point to 3 percent on
Sept. 26 wasn’t backed unanimously by central bank officials who
gave their recommendations, the central bank said in minutes of
the meeting released today.  The Tel-Bond 40 index of corporate bonds gained 0.3
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
