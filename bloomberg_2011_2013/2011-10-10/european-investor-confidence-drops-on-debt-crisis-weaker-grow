European investor confidence fell to
the lowest in more than two years in October on concern that the
region’s debt crisis and weaker growth in emerging markets will
hurt economic expansion.  An index measuring sentiment in the 17-nation euro region
declined to minus 18.5 from minus 15.4 in September, the
Limburg, Germany-based Sentix research institute said in an e-
mailed statement today. That’s the lowest since July 2009. A
gauge of current business conditions plunged to minus 5.75 from
minus 3.25, while an indicator of expectations dropped to minus
30.5 from minus 26.75.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index has dropped 11 percent since
Aug. 1 after Europe’s debt crisis spilled into Italy and Spain,
forcing the  European Central Bank  to start purchasing the
countries’ bonds. Euro-area growth almost stalled in the second
quarter after France’s recovery ground to a halt and Germany’s
expansion slowed more than expected.  “Above all, the unresolved sovereign-debt crisis in Europe
is worrying investors,”  Sentix  said. “There are also signals
of weaker growth in other regions of the world.”  Investor confidence in Asia, excluding  Japan , plunged to
9.2 in October from 13.7. Sentiment in eastern Europe and  Latin
America  also declined, today’s report showed.  Sentix said 925 investors participated in its monthly
survey, which was conducted Oct. 6-8. The results are never
revised.  To contact the reporter on this story:
