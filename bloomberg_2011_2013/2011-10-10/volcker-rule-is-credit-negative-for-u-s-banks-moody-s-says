The so-called “Volcker Rule”
proposal prohibiting short-term proprietary trading may hurt
investors in bank bonds because of its complex restrictions on
market making and hedging, Moody’s Investors Service said.  “It is credit negative for bondholders of Bank of America,
Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and  Morgan Stanley (MS) ,
all of which have substantial market-making operations,”
Moody’s said in its Weekly Credit Outlook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
