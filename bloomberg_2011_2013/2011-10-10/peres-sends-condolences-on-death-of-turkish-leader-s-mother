Israeli President  Shimon Peres  sent
condolences to Turkish Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  on
the death of his mother, according to a statement from his
office.  Relations between the two countries have been strained
since Israeli commandos intercepted a Turkish aid boat headed
for the  Gaza Strip  last year and killed nine people in clashes
with activists who tried to stop them from boarding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
