President  Barack Obama  and South
Korean President Lee Myung-bak will tour a  General Motors Co. (GM) 
plant in  Michigan  on Oct. 14 to promote the pending trade
agreement between the two countries, the White House said.  The leaders will tour GM’s Orion Assembly in Lake Orion,
outside Detroit, and deliver remarks about how the agreement
“will open up economic opportunities and support jobs on both
sides of the Pacific,” according to a statement released today
by the White House.  Lee will be in the U.S. next week on an official state
visit, including a dinner at the White House on Oct. 13.  The South Korea deal, the biggest since the  North American
Free Trade Agreement  in 1994, would boost U.S. exports by as
much as $10.9 billion in the first year in which it’s in full
effect, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission.
While the trade agreement was reached more than four years ago,
it was delayed as lawmakers complained about South Korean
barriers to imports of U.S. autos and beef.  To contact the reporter on this story:
