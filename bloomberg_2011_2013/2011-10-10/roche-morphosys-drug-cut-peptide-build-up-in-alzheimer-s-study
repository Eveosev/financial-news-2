Roche Holding AG (ROG)  and  Morphosys AG (MOR) ’s
experimental Alzheimer’s treatment gantenerumab appeared to
reduce the build-up in the brain of beta amyloid plaque thought
to be linked to the disease, according to a study published
today in Archives of Neurology.  Roche, based in Basel, Switzerland, sponsored the 16-person
study, which wasn’t intended to prove whether gantenerumab helps
patients. The drug is already being tested in a bigger mid-stage
study to help determine its effectiveness for people with early
symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.  To contact the reporter on this story:
