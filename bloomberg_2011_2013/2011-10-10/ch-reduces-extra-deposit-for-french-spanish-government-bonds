LCH Clearnet Ltd.,  Europe â€™s largest
clearing house, reduced the extra deposit it demands from
clients to trade French and Spanish government bonds and kept
the charge for Italian securities unchanged.  The so-called deposit factor charged for French bonds due
in seven-to-10 years will be 4.6 percent, compared with 8.53
percent for similar-maturity Spanish bonds and 6.65 percent for
Italian securities, LCH said in a  statement on its website  on
Oct. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
