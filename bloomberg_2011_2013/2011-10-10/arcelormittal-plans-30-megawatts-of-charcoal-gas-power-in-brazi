ArcelorMittal (MT) , the world’s largest
steelmaker, plans to tap the waste gas emitted during the
production of charcoal to produce as much as 30 megawatts of
electricity.  ArcelorMittal may upgrade all 254 of its wood-carbonizing
kilns in  Brazil  with pipes that funnel combustible gases to
power generators by 2016, Augusto Valencia Rodriguez, technology
and logistics manager of the Luxembourg-based company, said
today in a telephone interview.  “No one today is making use of this gas in a rational
way,” he said. The technology “will make our charcoal
operations much more efficient.”  The company’s Brazilian forestry unit ArcelorMittal
BioFlorestas is developing a 9 million-real ($5.14 million)
pilot project with the  Belo Horizonte , Brazil-based utility
Companhia Energetica de Minas Gerais to test the technology, he
said.  The project will draw so-called pyrolysis gas from 10 kilns
to power a 100-kilowatt turbine and will be installed in the
city of Martinho Campos, one of five ArcelorMittal BioFlorestas
charcoal-production sites in Minas Gerais state, he said.  Minas Gerais would be able to generate as much as 125
megawatts if its six biggest charcoal producers collected and
burnt all the gas emitted from their kilns, according to a Cemig
 report .  Brazil produced 11.6 million tons of charcoal in 2010,
according to a  report  from the Brasilia-based forestry
association Associacao Brasileira de Produtores de Florestas
Plantadas, making it the world’s top supplier.  Charcoal is used in steel production and accounts for 2.4
percent of Brazil’s national energy consumption, according to a
draft of the country’s latest 10-year energy  plan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
