Rains this week in sugar-cane
growing areas of  Brazil , the world’s largest sugar producer, may
threaten output this season, ICAP do Brasil CTVM said.  Sugar production in the Center South, the nation’s main
producing region, is estimated at 30 million metric tons,
Juliano Ferreira, a researcher at the Sao Paulo-based company,
said today by e-mail. Between 30 millimeters and 130 millimeters
(1.2 inches to 5.1 inches) of rain will fall in Sao Paulo state
over the next five days, according to weather forecaster Somar
Meteorologia. Average rainfall in the state in the whole of
October is 150 millimeters, said Marco Antonio dos Santos, an
agronomist at Somar.  “Rains in Brazil may result in sugar production falling
below 30 million tons,” Ferreira said. “Yields could be
reduced but the major impact would be from mills ending
operations for the season earlier due to rains.”  Mills in the South American country are unable to crush
cane when it’s too wet. Reactivating mills to process the
remainder of the harvest would be “too costly,” Ferreira
added.  The Center South cane harvest usually runs from mid-March
to December. Production of the sweetener in 2010-11 was 33.5
million tons, data from industry group Unica show.  Rains would be beneficial for the development of the crop
that will be harvested in the 2012-13 season, Santos said.  White, or refined, sugar for December delivery rose $26.30,
or 4 percent, to $680 a ton by 5:28 p.m. on NYSE Liffe in
 London . Raw sugar for March delivery climbed 1.26 cents, or 5
percent, to 26.42 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
