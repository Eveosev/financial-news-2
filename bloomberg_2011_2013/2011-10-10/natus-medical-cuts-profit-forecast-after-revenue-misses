Natus Medical Inc. (BABY) , the maker of
diagnostic products for hospitals, fell to its lowest price in
two years after saying fourth-quarter profit will be less than
forecast as orders in the neurology unit are delayed or reduced.  Natus declined 9 percent to $7.85 at 4 p.m. New York time,
the lowest value since March 2009. The stock of the San Carlos,
California-based company has dropped about 45 percent this year.  Profit may be 15 cents a share, missing July’s outlook of
19 to 20 cents a share, Natus said in a statement today. The
delays in orders for products to test for epilepsy and other
neurological conditions led to third-quarter revenue that was
less than expected, the company said. Sales from products for
hearing screening, brain monitoring and phototherapy were in
line with expectations.  “Hospital spending across the globe appears to be
weakening,” Joshua Zable, an analyst of WJB Capital in  New
York , wrote in a note today. He reiterated a “buy” rating on
the stock.  Fourth-quarter revenue is forecast to be $65 million after
sales in the third quarter were about $51.5 million, Natus said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
