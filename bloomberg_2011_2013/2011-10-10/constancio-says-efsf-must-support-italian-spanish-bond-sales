European Central Bank Vice President
 Vitor Constancio  said the region’s bailout fund should support
new bond issuances by Italy and Spain.  While recapitalizing banks is “important,” the priority
at the moment for the European Financial Stability Facility “is
to provide support to new bond issuance by, for instance, Italy
or Spain,” Constancio said in a  speech  in Milan today.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
Nicolas Sarkozy yesterday pledged to present a blueprint to
resolve the region’s debt crisis by a Nov. 3 Group of 20 nations
summit. French-Belgian  Dexia SA (DEXB) , once the world’s leading lender
to municipalities, became the first bank to fall victim to the
worsening crisis after concern over its European sovereign-debt
holdings caused short-term funding to evaporate.  The resources of the EFSF “should be dedicated to enhance
sovereign debt new issuance of securities, thus multiplying
their effect,” Constancio said. “It would be less efficient to
spend most of the funds available in the secondary market or in
supporting banks’ capitalization.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
