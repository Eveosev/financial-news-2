South Korea â€™s rice production may
decline by 1.9 percent this year as acreage fell, according to a
state agency report.  Output will probably decline to 4.22 million metric tons
from 4.30 million tons last year, Statistics Korea said in a
statement e-mailed today. Cultivation area for rice fell 4.3
percent to 854,000 hectares as new buildings ate into arable
rice paddy and some farmers switched to other crops, it said.  Farmers in the North Asian nation plant rice in May and
June and harvest between October and November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
