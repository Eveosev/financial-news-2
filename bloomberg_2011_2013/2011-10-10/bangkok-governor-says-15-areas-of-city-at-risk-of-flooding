Thai authorities are monitoring 15
areas of the capital, Bangkok, that are at most risk of
flooding, Bangkok Governor Sukhumbhand Paribatra said today.  Most of those areas are in Bangkok’s suburbs, he said in an
interview broadcast on TNN Cable TV. Authorities will also work
to protect the city’s main commercial and financial centers,
including areas around Silom, Sathorn and Sukhumvit, he said.  The most critical period will be between Oct. 16 and Oct.
18 as water from  Thailand ’s north flows through the city and
high tides are expected, Sukhumbhand said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
