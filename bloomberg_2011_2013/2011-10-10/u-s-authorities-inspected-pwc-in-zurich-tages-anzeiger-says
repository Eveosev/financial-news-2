U.S. inspectors examined files at
the Zurich offices of PricewaterhouseCoopers, Tages-Anzeiger
reported, citing Lukas Imark, the company’s head of legal
services in Switzerland.  A team of 10 officials from the  Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board  spent two weeks at PwC in mid-May and another
two in mid-June, the Swiss newspaper said. While they were
accompanied by eight Swiss officials, the exercise was a
“parallel inspection,” not a joint initiative, with the Swiss
ensuring their U.S. counterparts didn’t break local data laws,
Tages-Anzeiger quoted Frank Schneider, director of Switzerland’s
Federal Audit Oversight Authority, as saying.  More U.S. inspections will follow in “a few weeks” at
Ernst & Young, Switzerland’s second-biggest auditor after PwC,
and later at  KPMG , the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
