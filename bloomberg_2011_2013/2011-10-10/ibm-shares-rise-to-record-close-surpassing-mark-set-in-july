International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) , the world’s largest computer-services company, rose to a
record, surpassing the mark set in July.  IBM rose 2.3 percent to $186.62 at the close in New York,
giving it a market value of $222.9 billion. The price topped the
$185.21 it reached July 19.  “It’s attractive as a safer, less volatile investment in
tech in very turbulent times,” said Ed Maguire, an analyst at
Credit Agricole Securities USA in New York who rates the shares
“outperform.”  IBM, which went public in 1915, has gained 27 percent this
year, making it the best performer of the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average . The index, down 1.3 percent this year, jumped 3 percent
today as global markets rallied.  Chief Executive Officer  Sam Palmisano  divested the
company’s PC business six years ago, turning the company once
known for mainframe computers into the world’s biggest computer-
services provider. IBM is celebrating its 100th anniversary this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
