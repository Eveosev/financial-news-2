Indonesia ’s rupiah fell toward a 15-
month low as economists predicted the central bank will leave
borrowing costs unchanged for an eighth month at a meeting
tomorrow. Government bonds rose.  The currency declined for a second day as exchange data
showed foreign funds sold $120 million more local stocks than
they bought last week amid concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will
worsen.  Bank Indonesia  will keep its benchmark rate at 6.75
percent, according to all 15 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  “BI will keep the rate steady because rupiah volatility is
still too high to let  interest rates  go lower,” said Mika Martumpal, a currency analyst at PT Bank Commonwealth in
Jakarta. “The volatility in global markets is still the main
driver behind the rupiah’s movement against the dollar.”  The rupiah dropped 0.7 percent to 8,958 per dollar as of
9:34 a.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency fell to 9,115 on Sept. 26,
the lowest level since June 2010, and lost more than 4 percent
in the past month.  Policy makers will remain in the market to stabilize the
rupiah and purchase  government bonds , Hendar, Bank Indonesia’s
director of monetary policy who uses only one name, said on Oct.
3. Foreign-exchange reserves dropped $10.1 billion last month
from a record $124.6 billion in August, official data showed
last week.  The yield on the government’s 10-year benchmark bond fell
10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage point, to 6.77 percent, the
lowest level in a month, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
