Penn West Petroleum Ltd. said
production wasn’t affected after a leak from an emulsion line in
northern  Alberta .  About 12 barrels of an oil-water mix leaked outside of the
containment area, Jason Fleury, a spokesman based in the company
headquarters in Calgary, said in a telephone interview. The leak
has been cleaned up and output at the site wasn’t affected, he
said.  Emulsion lines carry unprocessed oil from wellheads to
tanks.  The pipeline is near Swan Hills, 138 miles (222 kilometers)
northwest of Edmonton, according to the Alberta Energy Resources
Conservation Board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
