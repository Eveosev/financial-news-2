South Korea , Asia’s fourth-biggest
polluter, said  Posco (005490)  and Samsung Electronics Co. are among 366
companies that should cut about 8.3 million metric tons of
greenhouse-gas emission next year.  The reductions will account for 1.4 percent of the
companies’ estimated emissions, the Ministry of  Knowledge
Economy  said today in an e-mailed statement. The government will
offer tax breaks and loans to companies to invest in energy-
saving equipments.  South Korea said in November 2009 it plans to voluntarily
cut emissions by 30 percent from expected 2020 level, or 4
percent below its 2005 emissions. The 366 companies identified
by the government would produce 585.2 million tons of carbon
dioxide next year without reduction efforts, the ministry said.  Posco, the world’s third biggest steelmaker, has a target
to cut 963,000 tons of emission, while Samsung Electronics
should reduce 429,000 tons, the statement said. LG Display Co.
and  Hyundai Steel Co. (004020)  are expected to cut carbon dioxide
emission by 327,000 tons and 192,000 tons, respectively.  Companies face fines of as much as 10 million won ($8,534)
if they don’t meet their targets, according to the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
