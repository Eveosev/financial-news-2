Research in Motion Ltd. (RIM)  said its
BlackBerry e-mail has been restored after some subscribers in
Europe, the Middle East and Africa lost access to their data.  “Some customers may continue to experience delays with
instant messaging and browsing services and our technical teams
are working to return services to normal operation as quickly as
possible,” the Waterloo, Ontario-based company said in an e-
mailed statement. “We apologize to our customers.”  The disruption affected the company’s instant messaging,
known as  BlackBerry Messenger , and other data services, mobile-
phone network operator  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  said today.  Last month, RIM missed analysts’ profit and sales estimates
after customers defected to  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone and handsets
that run Google Inc.’s Android platform. RIM’s share of the
global smartphone market dropped to 12 percent in the second
quarter from 19 percent a year earlier, according to Gartner
Inc.  RIM fell 13 cents to $23.23 today at the close of New York
trading. The shares have dropped 60 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
