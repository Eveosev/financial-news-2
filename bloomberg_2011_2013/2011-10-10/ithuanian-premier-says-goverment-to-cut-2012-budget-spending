Lithuania’s government will cut
about 300 million litai in spending from next year’s budget to
help the Baltic nation achieve a deficit of 2.8 percent of
economic output, Premier Andrius Kubilius said.  The government “can’t rule out” a possible downward
revision of the 2012 economic-growth forecast, Finance Minister
 Ingrida Simonyte  added at a press conference today where she
spoke along with Kubilius.  To contact the reporter on this story:
