The financial catastrophe in Greece
is damaging public health and wellbeing, according to six
medical academics including Alexander Kentikelenis and David
Stuckler of  Cambridge University  and Martin McKee of the  London 
School of Hygiene and  Tropical Medicine .  In a letter published in the  Lancet , a medical journal with
offices in London,  New York  and Beijing, they analyzed European
Union statistics based on replies by 12,346 and 15,045 Greeks in
2007 and 2009, respectively.  The group said 2009 saw significant increases in the number
of people reporting that they didn’t see a doctor or dentist
despite feeling it was necessary to do so, and in those
reporting that their health was “bad” or “very bad.”  Since Greece’s public health-care system entitles citizens
to visit general practitioners free of charge and to attend
hospital outpatient clinics at low cost, the reduced access
probably reflected the fact that there were cuts of about 40
percent in hospital budgets, understaffing, occasional shortages
of medical supplies, and bribery of medical staff to jump queues
at overcrowded hospitals, the group wrote.  The number of suicides was 17 percent higher in 2009 than
in 2007, unofficial figures cited in parliament mentioned a 25
percent increase in 2010 compared with 2009, and the minister of
health reported a 40 percent rise in the first half of 2011
compared with the year-earlier period, according to the letter.  Greece ’s national suicide helpline reported that 25 percent
of callers in 2010 faced financial difficulties, the group said,
concluding that “greater attention to health and health-care
access is needed to ensure that the Greek crisis does not
undermine the ultimate source of the country’s wealth -- its
people.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
