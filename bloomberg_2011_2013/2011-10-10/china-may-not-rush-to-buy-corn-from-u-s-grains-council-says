China may not need to purchase corn
from the U.S. after having a “successful” harvest, the U.S.
Grains Council said.  There is no reason for China to “rush into the market” if
prices increase to the “mid-$6.00 range,” the group said in a
web  report  dated Oct. 7. The country may continue to watch to
see if prices fall below $6.00 a bushel, the report said without
elaborating.  Prices will likely trade between $6.20 and $6.80 a bushel
before rebounding in the spring, it said.  Corn for December delivery jumped as much as 2.1 percent to
$6.125 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade today before
trading at $6.105 by 11:35 a.m. Beijing time.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
