Slovakia’s ruling coalition leaders
failed to reach an agreement before Parliament’s lawmakers vote
on a euro-area bailout plan.  Prime Minister  Iveta Radicova  and Bela Bugar, the head of
junior coalition member the Most Party, told reporters in
Bratislava today that political leaders will meet again tomorrow
to solve a dispute that threatens to delay the euro region’s
approval of the European Financial Stability Facility.  To contact the reporters on this story:
