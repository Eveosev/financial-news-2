Khalaf Al Habtoor, one of the Middle
Eastern investors who bought shares in  Barclays Plc (BARC)  as the
British lender sought funds during the credit crisis, said he
sold his stake in December 2009 at a “minor” loss.  The U.A.E.-based investor said he sold his shares in the
bank at 322 pence apiece, almost double their value today, after
being disappointed when the lender cut its dividend. The
businessman founded Al Habtoor Group, which spans hospitality,
construction, automotive and engineering businesses. He
declined to say who bought his Barclays stake.  “We sold it at the right time, and we learned a lot from
investing in international banks,” Al Habtoor said by phone
from Dubai. “The first-year dividend was excellent, but then
they decided to distribute a nominal dividend. We decided to
divest.”  In 2008, London-based Barclays sold stakes to investors
including Al Habtoor and Qatar’s sovereign-debt fund as it aimed
to raise 4.5 billion pounds ($7.1 billion) in the wake of the
failures of Bear Stearns Cos. and Northern Rock Plc.  The stock subsequently tumbled as the financial crisis
worsened and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed, reaching
47.3 pence in January 2009 before rebounding from March of that
year. Barclays scrapped its final dividend for 2008 and paid a
1-penny dividend in 2009 before increasing payments last year.  Barclays shares have resumed their descent, losing 41
percent in the past 12 months as the European sovereign-debt
crisis worsened. The shares traded at 170.7 pence as of 3:43
p.m. in  London  today.  Al Habtoor said his stake originally accounted for about 2
percent of Barclays’ equity, though that shrank to 1 percent at
the time of his divestment after the lender brought in more
investors to increase capital.  In June 2009, when he said he planned to increase his
stake, Al Habtoor called the price “attractive” and said he
had “confidence in the bank’s strength and the U.K.’s
regulatory system.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
