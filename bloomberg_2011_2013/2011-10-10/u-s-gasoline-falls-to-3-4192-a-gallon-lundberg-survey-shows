The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. filling stations fell 12.54 cents to $3.4192 a
gallon.  The price covers the two-week period ended Oct. 7 and is
derived from a survey of about 2,500 filling stations nationwide
by Camarillo, California-based  Trilby Lundberg . The average
price is about 23 percent above a year earlier, when the average
was $2.77.  “You could see an extended period of far lower prices,”
Lundberg said yesterday in a telephone interview. Any rally in
crude would spur an increase in gasoline costs as well, though
high levels of unemployment may crimp demand and limit price
gains, she said.  The front-month gasoline contract on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  rose 3.6 percent to $2.6476 a gallon in the
two weeks ended Oct. 7.  U.S. gasoline stockpiles declined 1.14 million barrels to
213.7 million in the week ended Sept. 30, according to Energy
Department data. It was the first decline in five weeks.  Crude prices may fall this week on concern that the
European sovereign-debt crisis will spread, threatening economic
growth and fuel demand, according to a Bloomberg News survey.
Oil futures for November delivery rose 4.8 percent to $82.98 a
barrel last week.  Debt Downgrades  Fitch Ratings  downgraded the government debt of Italy and
Spain on Oct. 7, citing factors that included their
vulnerability to the “euro zone crisis.” Belgium had its Aa1
local and foreign currency government-bond ratings placed on
review for possible downgrade by Moody’s Investors Service,
which cited the financing environment for euro sovereigns and
increasing risks to economic growth.  In the U.S., the  unemployment rate  in September held at 9.1
percent, according to Labor Department data. The jobless rate
has been at 9 percent or higher for 27 of the past 29 months.
Payrolls climbed by 103,000 workers after a revised 57,000
increase the prior month that was more than originally
estimated.  Pacific Investment Management Co.’s  Bill Gross  said the
employment gains aren’t enough to sustain growth. The economy
needs 200,000 to 250,000 new jobs per month to expand, Gross,
manager of the world’s biggest bond fund, said in a radio
interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene  and Ken Prewitt on Oct. 7.  On  Long Island , regular gasoline averaged $3.71 a gallon,
Lundberg said. Los Angeles-area retail stations averaged $3.77 a
gallon.  The highest price in the lower 48 U.S. states among the
cities surveyed on Oct. 7 was in  San Francisco , with $3.81 a
gallon. The lowest price was in  Albuquerque , New Mexico, where a
gallon averaged $3.07, Lundberg said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
