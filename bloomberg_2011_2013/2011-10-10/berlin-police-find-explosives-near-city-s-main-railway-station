Police in Berlin found explosives in
a tunnel leading to the city’s main train station, foiling a
possible attack in the center of the German capital hours after
a signal station caught fire northwest of the city.  Authorities closed off the station’s north tunnel at around
noon today after employees for state railway  Deutsche Bahn  AG
found a number of bottles containing flammable fluid, Federal
Police spokeswoman Nadine Marschner said. The closure disrupted
traffic in and out of the glass-and-steel terminal, which opened
in 2006 as  Europe ’s largest multilevel station.  Deutsche Bahn condemned the attack and referred to a note
claiming responsibility for the incident that criticized
Germany’s military involvement in  Afghanistan . The note, from a
group calling itself the “Hekla Reception Committee --
Initiative for More Social Eruptions,” threatened to sabotage
traffic in the city,  Bild newspaper  reported.  “This is absolutely irresponsible,” Gerd Neubeck, the
director of Deutsche Bahn’s security office, said in a
statement. “With a rail network stretching 34,000 kilometers
(21,100 miles), comprehensive security is simply impossible.”  Unidentified assailants also set fire early today to a rail
signal station on the Berlin-Hamburg route in the state of
Brandenburg, which surrounds Berlin, Marschner said.  Germany  is the third-largest troop contributor to the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization’s mission in Afghanistan with about
5,000 personnel. This week is the 10-year anniversary of the
U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
