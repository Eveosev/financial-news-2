Danish banks tightened credit
standards in the third quarter as writedowns rose and lenders
forecast more losses by the end of the year, the central bank
said.  Banks tightened standards for corporate lending, including
raising prices, as writedowns and losses by small- and medium-
sized enterprises rose, the central bank said in its quarterly
survey published on today.  Mortgage and commercial banks also tightened credit
standards for consumers to reflect growing risk and the lendersâ€™
own higher funding costs, the central bank said. The tightening
took the form of lending fees, it said. Household demand for
loans fell, while corporate borrowing was largely unchanged, the
bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
