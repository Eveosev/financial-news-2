Bandanna Energy Ltd. (BND) , an Australian
coal developer, remains in talks with potential parties for a
possible sale of the company or its assets and has recently
received approaches from new groups.  “Bandanna confirms that there remain a number of parties
involved in the strategic review process and that requests from
additional third parties to investigate potential joint venture,
off-take, investment and other opportunities have also recently
been received and the company is evaluating the opportunities,”
the Brisbane-based company said today in a statement. An Oct. 7
report from Dow Jones Newswires that the company’s review had
ended with no adequate offers is  “baseless,” it said.  Bandanna, which owns coal projects in Queensland state’s
Bowen and Galilee Basins, holds the largest power-station coal
inventory for any exploration company in  Australia , according to
its website. It said in May that a shortlist of bidders has been
selected.  Bandanna, which is being advised by UBS AG, rose 4.2
percent to 98.5 cents at 10:39 a.m. in Sydney trading, trimming
losses since the start of the year to 29 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
