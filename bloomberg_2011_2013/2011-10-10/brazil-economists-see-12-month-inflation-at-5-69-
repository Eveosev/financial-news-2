Economists covering  Brazil  raised
their 2012 inflation forecast for a sixth straight week in
expectation that a weaker real and cuts in borrowing costs will
stoke faster price increases.  Analysts raised the estimate to 5.59 percent from 5.53
percent a week earlier, according to the median estimate in an
Oct. 7  central bank survey  of about 100 economists published
today. They also raised their forecast for 2013 inflation to
4.85 percent from 4.80 percent, according to the weekly survey.  “In part this could reflect the worsening expectations for
the  exchange rate ,”  Zeina Latif , a senior economist with RBS
Securities Inc. in Sao Paulo, said in a telephone interview.
“Markets could be expecting that the drop in commodities prices
is not enough to compensate for the foreign exchange pressure.”  The faster inflation expectations could limit the central
bank’s room to reduce  interest rates , Latif said. Brazil’s
central bank President Alexandre Tombini last week said that
“moderate” cuts in rates will help shield the economy from the
European debt crisis without compromising the inflation target.
Tombini has repeatedly pledged to slow inflation to the bank’s
4.5 percent target by the end of 2012.  ‘Substantial Deterioration’  Tombini surprised analysts Aug. 31 by slashing the
benchmark Selic rate 50 basis points to 12 percent, citing a
“substantial deterioration” in the global outlook. Analysts
expect another 0.5 percentage point cut at the central bank’s
policy meeting next week, the survey showed.  The yield on the interest rate futures contract maturing in
January 2013, the most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, rose six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 10.49 percent at 8:25 a.m.
New York time. The real appreciated 1.8 percent to 1.7404 per
dollar.  Economists forecast the Brazilian currency to end next year
at 1.75 per  U.S. dollar , compared with a forecast of 1.70 a week
earlier.  This year, consumer prices as measured by the IPCA index
are forecast to rise 6.52 percent, unchanged from the previous
week’s survey.  Consumer prices rose 7.31 percent in the year through
September, exceeding the 6.5 percent upper limit of the central
bank’s target range for a sixth straight month. The bank targets
inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two percentage points.  Latin America ’s biggest economy will grow 3.50 percent this
year, less than a forecast of 3.51 percent the previous week,
according to the survey. Analysts held their 2012 growth
forecast at 3.70 percent.  The S&P GSCI Index of commodities gained 2.6 percent last
week. Commodities rose 7.8 percent in September, according to
the central bank’s commodities price index, which tracks prices
of raw materials it says are most relevant to Brazil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
