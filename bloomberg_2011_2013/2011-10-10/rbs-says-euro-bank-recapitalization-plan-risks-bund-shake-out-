The potential for euro-area policy
makers to recapitalize the region’s banks may prevent the safest
 government bonds  from extending this year’s advance, Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc said.  “We are all being a bit more circumspect and less gung-ho
about our bond-bull stance,”  Andrew Roberts , head of European
rates strategy in London, wrote in an investor report on Oct. 7.
“We are hardening this circumspection on two things: bank
recapitalization and consensus-view change.” Such a plan for
the region’s lenders “risks a bund shake-out,” Roberts wrote.  German 10-year bonds fell last week, pushing the yield up
to 2 percent on Oct. 7 from 1.89 percent on Sept. 30. Still, the
yield has slid almost 1 percentage point from 2.96 percent on
Dec. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
