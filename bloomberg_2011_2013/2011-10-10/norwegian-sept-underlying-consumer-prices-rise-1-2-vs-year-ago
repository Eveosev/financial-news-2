Norwegian inflation accelerated last
month as the central bank signaled it would delay planned
interest rate increases amid a deepening European debt crisis.  The underlying inflation rate, adjusted for taxes, fees and
energy prices, climbed to 1.2 percent in September from 0.8
percent a month earlier, Oslo-based  Statistics Norway  said
today. The rate was forecast at 1 percent, according to the
median estimate of 11 economists in a Bloomberg survey. Prices
rose 1.2 percent in the month, led by a jump in clothing costs.
Headline inflation was 1.6 percent, also faster than the 1.3
percent estimated in a survey.  The central bank, which targets price growth of about 2.5
percent, in August postponed plans to raise its benchmark rate
and last month signaled it may keep rates unchanged at 2.25
percent until next year. Norwayâ€™s government last week presented
a 2012 budget plan that will increase the use of its oil money
and stimulate the economy by 0.3 percentage point amid concern
that the euro area debt crisis will sap exports.  The krone was little changed at 7.8041 per euro and climbed
1 percent to 5.7702 per dollar as of 10:08 a.m. in Oslo.  Policy makers will meet on Oct. 19 to decide on  interest
rates  and publish updated rate expectations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
