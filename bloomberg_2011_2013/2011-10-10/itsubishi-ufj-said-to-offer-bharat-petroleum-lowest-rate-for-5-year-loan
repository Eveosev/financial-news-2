Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. is
offering a rate of about 235 basis points more than the London
interbank offered rate to lend  Bharat Petroleum  Corp. $400
million for five years, according to two people familiar with
the matter.  The rate is the lowest that Bharat Petroleum has received
for the financing, one of the people said, asking not to be
identified as details are private.  Bharat Petroleum, India’s second-largest state-run oil
refiner, also received bids from several other banks, including
one of more than 300 basis points over Libor, another person
familiar with the matter said on Sept. 26. The rate includes
interest and fees a borrower has to pay for a loan.  Proceeds will be used for capital expenditure in the second
half of this financial year and the company has no further plans
for any more overseas loans this fiscal year, the person said
today.  Bharat Petroleum Chairman R.K. Singh didn’t answer a call
to his mobile phone seeking comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
