Shares of the following companies
may have unusual moves in Malaysia trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close in  Kuala Lumpur .  Malaysia’s  FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBMKLCI)  Index fell 3.01, or 0.2
percent, to 1,397.04, its first drop in four sessions.  Guinness Anchor Bhd. (GUIN)   added 2.2 percent to 10.12
ringgit, the biggest gain since Sept. 27 and  JT International
Bhd. (RJR)   rose 4.5 percent to 6.06 ringgit, after the
government refrained from raising taxes for tobacco and alcohol
in last week’s budget. JT International and brewer Guinness are
beneficiaries, OSK Holdings Bhd. said in a report today.  KNM Group Bhd. (KNMG)  , an oil and gas services provider,
slid 2.4 percent to 1.20 ringgit. KNM will miss its internal
targets for this financial year after delays to a project with
Peterborough Renewable Energy Ltd., it said in a statement.  Tenaga Nasional Bhd. (TNB)  , Malaysia’s biggest power
producer, slid 1.7 percent to 5.29 ringgit, its biggest drop
since Oct. 3. The government’s budget, aimed at alleviating the
rising cost of living, will diminish any prospects for an
increase in electricity rates this year, ECM Libra Capital Sdn.
wrote in a report today. Tenaga’s full-year earnings results due
on Oct. 28 may also miss consensus earnings because of higher
fuel costs, Citigroup Inc. said in a separate report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
