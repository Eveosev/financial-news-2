Hungary may cut public debt to as
low as 56 percent of gross domestic product by 2020 if the
government delivers reform measures and keeps the structural
budget gap at 1.5 percent of output, the central bank said.  Government debt would probably still exceed the current
average of regional competitors, and its level “will limit the
room for fiscal maneuvers for years to come,” the  Magyar
Nemzeti Bank  said in a report today.  Hungary is raising taxes and cutting spending to trim the
2012  budget deficit  to 2.5 percent of GDP as the economy slows.
The Cabinet of Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  slashed its growth
forecast for next year in two steps to 1.5 percent, higher than
the central bank’s 1 percent projection.  Hungary “should undertake deliberate” planning for euro
adoption even without Orban aiming to start using  Europe ’s
common currency before the end of the decade, the study said.  “Fiscal policy should aim for a much stricter debt level
than the Maastricht criterion in order to have adequate room to
manoeuvre,” it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
