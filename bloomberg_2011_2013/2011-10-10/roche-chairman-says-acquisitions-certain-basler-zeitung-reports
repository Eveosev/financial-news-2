Roche Group AG Chairman Franz Humer
said that the company would “certainly” make more acquistions,
Basler Zeitung reported, citing an interview.  “We’ll certainly buy here and there” and “acquisitions
in the single-digit billions are always possible,” the Swiss
newspaper quoted Humer as saying.  Humer said he would stand for re-election next year, the
report said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
