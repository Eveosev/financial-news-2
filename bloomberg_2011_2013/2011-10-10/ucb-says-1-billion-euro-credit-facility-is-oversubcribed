UCB SA (UCB)  said the amendment and
restatement of its 1 billion-euro revolving credit facility was
successfully closed “with significant oversubscription.”  UCB entered into negotiations with its core-relationship
banks as a result of an improvement in general loan market
conditions earlier this year, the company said today in an e-
mailed statement. The amendment results in an extension of the
maturity from 2015 to 2016, reduced margin and the removal of
all financial covenants, the company said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
