Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) 
priced about $5.5 billion of bonds in dollars, British pounds
and euros backed by U.K. mortgages, according to a banker
familiar with the transaction.  Arran Residential Mortgages Funding 2011-2 Plc is tied to
GBP3.57 billion ($5.6 billion) of prime residential mortgage
loans originated through RBS and National Westminster Home
Loans, said the banker, who declined to be identified because
the deal is private.  RBS will retain some of the notes, while JPMorgan Chase &
Co. and Citigroup Inc. led investors that plan to purchase other
portions of the bonds, the banker said.  The three lenders, Bank of America Corp. and  Wells Fargo &
Co . arranged the transaction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
