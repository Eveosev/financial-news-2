Shares of  Rojana Industrial Park
Pcl (ROJNA) , a Thai developer of industrial land, dropped to a two-year
low in Bangkok trading after flooding in Ayutthaya province
forced the closure of its biggest manufacturing complex.  The shares slid 13 percent to 6.10 baht at 11:21 a.m. local
time, heading for the lowest close since Aug. 3, 2009. The stock
was the worst performer in the 485-member SET Index, which fell
1 percent.  Flooding has closed all plants at Rojana’s industrial park
in  Thailand ’s Ayutthaya province, 67 kilometers (42 miles) north
of Bangkok, the company said in regulatory filing today. The
closure will affect revenue from services and utilities, the
company said.  “The flooding has a significant impact on Rojana, as new
sales and rentals will be hurt in the short term,” Noppadol
Piriyawut, an analyst at Thanachart Securities Co. Ltd., wrote
in a report today. “Its development cost will probably
increase” following the flooding, the analyst said.  Nikon, Canon, Hitachi Metals Ltd. and Siam Cement Pcl are
among companies with operations at the estate, according to
Rojana’s website.  At least 269 people have been killed and 2.4 million
displaced as a result of seasonal monsoon rains that have hit
the country since July 25, the Department of Disaster Prevention
and Mitigation  said  on its website today. About 30 of Thailand’s
77 provinces remain underwater, the agency said.  -- Editor:  Matthew Oakley   To contact the reporter on this story:
