Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services
assigned its ‘BB’ issue rating to the proposed 100 million-euro
senior unsecured notes to be issued by a unit of Fresenius
Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA, S&P said in an e-mailed statement
today.  “We have also assigned a recovery rating of ‘3’ to the
notes, indicating our expectation of meaningful (50%-70%)
recovery in the event of a payment default,” the statement
said. “The recovery and issue ratings on FMC’s other debt
facilities remain unchanged.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
