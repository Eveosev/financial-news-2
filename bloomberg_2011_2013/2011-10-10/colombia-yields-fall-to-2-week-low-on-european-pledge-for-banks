Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields on benchmark securities to a two-week low, after a pledge
by French and German leaders to deliver a plan to support banks
led to increased appetite for higher-yielding, emerging-market
assets.  The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 10 percent bonds due in
July 2024 fell seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to
7.51 percent at 9:31 a.m. Bogota time. That’s its lowest level
on a closing basis since Sept. 27. The bond’s price rose 0.636
centavo to 119.959 centavos per peso.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  said in Berlin yesterday they have given
themselves three weeks to devise a plan to recapitalize banks
and find a “durable” solution for Greece’s debt load.  “Markets are somewhat optimistic on the bank plan,” said
Camilo Perez, head analyst at Banco de Bogota SA, Colombia’s
second-biggest bank.  Colombia’s peso jumped 1 percent to 1,914.95 per  U.S.
dollar  in the next-day market, according to the stock exchange’s
foreign-exchange electronic transactions system, known as SET-
FX. Because of the Columbus Day holiday in the U.S., Colombia’s
currency trades in the so-called next-day market, in which
payment and delivery are made the following trading day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
