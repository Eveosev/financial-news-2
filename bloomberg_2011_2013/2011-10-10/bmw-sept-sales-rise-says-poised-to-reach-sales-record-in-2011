Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , the
world’s biggest manufacturer of  luxury vehicles , expanded its
lead over  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi, buoyed by demand for the X3
sport-utility vehicle.  Sales at BMW’s namesake brand rose 9.3 percent to 128,446
vehicles in September as deliveries of the X3 more than tripled,
the Munich-based automaker said today in a statement. Audi
posted a 17 percent gain, delivering 120,200 autos on stronger
demand in  China , the Ingolstadt, Germany-based company said.  “It’s all holding up extremely well,” said  Arndt Ellinghorst , an analyst with Credit Suisse in  London . The growth
rates of about 20 percent that BMW and Audi posted in China are
“quite healthy.”  BMW, Audi, and  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz are targeting
record sales this year and anticipate demand for high-end
vehicles to outpace the broader auto market in the coming years.
European investor confidence fell to the lowest in more than two
years this month on concern that the region’s debt crisis and
weaker growth in emerging markets will hurt economic expansion.  “We made solid gains across the globe and once again
achieved record sales for September,”  Ian Robertson , BMW’s
sales chief, said in the statement. The company is “on course”
to meet its target of delivering 1.6 million vehicles this year
and aims to maintain an “upward trend” in the fourth quarter,
he said.  Shares Climb  BMW rose as much as 3.7 percent to 52.78 euros and was up
3.6 percent at 4:16 p.m. in Frankfurt. The stock has fallen 10
percent this year, valuing the company at 33.8 billion euros.
Daimler gained 3.8 percent to 35.28 euros and Volkswagen jumped
4.8 percent to 106.30 euros.  Audi aims to sell more than 300,000 vehicles in China for
the first time after already surpassing last year’s total,  Peter Schwarzenbauer , Audi’s sales chief, said in the statement. The
carmaker also increased deliveries in debt-strapped countries
such as Italy and Spain, helped by the A6 sedan and A1
subcompact, the company said.  “Growth is being driven above all by the emerging markets,
primarily from China, but also from Brazil, Russia, India and
Turkey,” said Marc-Rene Tonn, a Hamburg-based analyst with
Warburg Research, who recommends buying Daimler and Volkswagen
shares, and has a "hold" rating on BMW. “The question is how
the sales values hold up there.”  Mercedes in Third  BMW expanded its lead over Audi and Mercedes after the
first nine months of 2011, delivering 1.02 million vehicles
compared with Audi’s 973,200 and Mercedes’s 919,288. The Daimler
unit, which aims to overtake Audi and BMW by 2020, remained in
third place after sales last month edged up 2 percent to 120,982
cars and SUVs, the Stuttgart, Germany-based company said Oct. 5.  “It’s probably not going to get much better for Mercedes
before 2013,” said Ellinghorst. Consumers are looking to trade
down to smaller vehicles, a “weak” area for Mercedes, he said.  Mercedes’ best-selling C-Class will also face tougher
competition next year, as BMW prepares to introduce a revamped
version of the 3-Series sedan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
