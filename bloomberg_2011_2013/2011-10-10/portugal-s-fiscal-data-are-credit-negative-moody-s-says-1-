Portugal ’s second-quarter fiscal and
gross domestic product figures showed a higher-than-expected
government deficit equal to 8.3 percent of GDP for first half of
2011, according to Moody’s Investors Service.  The figures are “credit negative” for Portugal, Moody’s
said in its Weekly Credit Outlook today.  “A disorderly default by the Greek government would pose
the biggest near-term disruption risk to Portugal’s reform
plans,” the report said. “A market contagion likely would
spread through the euro area.”  Countries receiving support from the European Financial
Stability Facility such as Portugal and Ireland would be
especially hurt, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
