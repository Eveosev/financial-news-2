Iran  said all the phases of the
South Pars natural-gas field will come on stream by October
2015,  Shana  reported, citing Mousavi Souri, the managing
director of the South Pars Gas and Oil Co.  Iran will complete phases 15 and 16 by April 2012 and phase
11 will be the last, Souri said, according to the oil ministry’s
news website.  The Persian Gulf nation in January said that it plans to
complete the development of South Pars, which together with
Qatar’s North Field forms the world’s largest known deposit of
the fuel, by March 2015. Iran’s plans to develop South Pars have
been hampered by international economic and financial sanctions
over the state’s nuclear program. The field’s development
consists of 28 phases, Iranian officials have said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
