China ’s retail sales were “robust”
during last week’s seven-day national holiday, the Ministry of
Commerce said, signaling  consumer spending  is supporting
expansion in the world’s second-biggest economy.  Spending at shops and restaurants surveyed by the ministry
over the so-called Golden Week break jumped 17.5 percent from a
year earlier to 696.2 billion yuan ($109 billion), the ministry
said in  a statement  on its website dated Oct. 7.  Companies including Suning Appliance Co. are benefiting as
higher incomes encourage consumers in the world’s most populous
nation to boost purchases of home appliances, jewelry and mobile
phones. That’s helping sustain growth amid Wen Jiabao’s campaign
to cool inflation and rein in surging property prices.   “Chinese consumers were upbeat during the golden week,” Lu Ting, an economist at Bank of America Corp. in  Hong Kong , said 
in a report today. “We expect China’s consumption growth to 
remain stable, backed by rapid wage growth, relatively stable
confidence in the domestic economy and the rapid accumulation of
wealth of Chinese households.”  Prices of food and daily necessities were “basically
stable” over the national holiday and supplies were
“adequate,” the ministry said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
