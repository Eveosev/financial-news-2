JT International Bhd. (RJR) , Malaysia’s
second-biggest cigarette maker, rose the most in almost nine
months in Kuala Lumpur trading after the government refrained
from raising taxes for tobacco and alcohol in last week’s
budget.  JT International and local brewer  Guinness Anchor Bhd. (GUIN)  are
beneficiaries,  OSK Holdings Bhd. (OSK)  said in a report today. JT rose
5.2 percent to 6.10 ringgit at 9:05 a.m local time.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
