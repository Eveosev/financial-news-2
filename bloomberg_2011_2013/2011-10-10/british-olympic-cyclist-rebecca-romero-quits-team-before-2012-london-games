Rebecca Romero, the only British
woman to win Olympic medals in two different sports, today
dropped out of the cycling squad for next year’s Games after
setbacks in training.  The 31-year-old rider won the individual pursuit at the
2008 Games in Beijing, and had already won a silver medal as a
rower. She took up cycling in 2006 after finishing second in the
quadruple sculls in  Athens  two years earlier.  “Having suffered several setbacks at crucial points, I
believe I’m no longer on a pathway which will see me fulfill my
Olympic ambition to win a second Olympic gold medal,” Romero
 said in a statement  on British Cycling’s website. “I’m proud to
have contributed to the cycling team’s great Olympic triumph in
Beijing.”  Cycling was Britain’s most successful event in the 2008
Games, when the team won eight gold medals, four silver and two
bronze. She switched to road cycling after the individual
pursuit event was dropped from next year’s Olympics in  London .  “It’s a shame to lose an Olympic Champion going into the
Olympic year,” Performance Manager Shane Sutton said in the
statement. “We have some great young talent in addition to
experienced riders in the Team Pursuit squad. I’m confident we
can remain on track to hit our performance targets in the lead
up to and during the London  Olympic Games .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
