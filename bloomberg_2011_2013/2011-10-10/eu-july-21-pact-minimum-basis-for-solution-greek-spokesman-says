Greece ’s government said a July 21
agreement by European Union leaders is the minimum basis for a
solution for the euro area, according to government spokesman
Ilias Mosialos.    “We insist that the July 21 agreement is the minimum basis
of a solution for us,” Mosialos told reporters in Athens today.
“Anything else must be legally secure and add to that.”  Mosialos said “any euro solution for us has to be
carefully crafted and legally secure.” He said that talks with
inspectors from the European Union,  European Central Bank  and
 International Monetary Fund  in Athens would close soon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
