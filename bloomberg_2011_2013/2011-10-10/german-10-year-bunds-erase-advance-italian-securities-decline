German 10-year bund yields were
within three basis points of the highest in more than five weeks
after  Germany  and France’s leaders said they will draw up a plan
to recapitalize banks and shore up Greece’s finances.  Italian and Spanish bonds slid after  Fitch Ratings  lowered
the nations’ credit rankings. Belgian 10-year bonds slipped
after the federal government said it agreed to pay 4 billion
euros ($5.4 billion) for the local consumer-lending unit of
 Dexia SA (DEXB)  and guarantee 60 percent of a so-called bad bank to be
set up for the lender’s troubled assets.  The 10-year bund yield was little changed at 2 percent at
9:29 a.m. in London after reaching 2.03 percent on Oct. 7, the
highest since Sept. 2. The 2.25 percent security maturing
September 2021 traded at 102.2.  The rate on similar-maturity Italian debt increased five
basis points to 5.57 percent, while the yield on Spanish 10-year
bonds rose three basis points to 5.02 percent. Belgian 10-year
yields were two basis points higher at 4 percent.  Bunds have handed investors a profit of 7 percent this
year, while Treasuries have returned 8.3 percent, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
