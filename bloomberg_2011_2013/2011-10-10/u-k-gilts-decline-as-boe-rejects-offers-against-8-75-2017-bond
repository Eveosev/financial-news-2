U.K. government bonds extended
declines after the  Bank of England  rejected all bids against one
of the bonds it planned to buy today as part of its
quantitative-easing program.  Ten-year yields reached the most this month after the
central bank said in a statement it decided “to reject all
offers against UKT 8.75 25/08/17 following significant changes
in its yield in the run up to the auction.” Gilts had dropped
earlier, along with bunds, after Germany and France’s leaders
said they will draw up a plan to recapitalize banks and stop
Greece’s debt crisis spreading, sapping demand for the safest
government assets.  The bond was rejected because traders had been pushing the
price up “aggressively, obviously in the hope that they’d be
able to sell it to the Bank of England,” said  John Wraith , a
fixed-income strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global
Research in London. “The BOE rejected it and that might have
given people a bit of a shock. There would have been some people
who hoped that the bank would be willing to pay significantly
higher prices for the bonds.”  Ten-year gilt yields were eight basis points higher at 2.55
percent at 3:54 p.m. in London. The 3.75 percent security
maturing in 2021 fell 0.775, or 7.55 pounds per 1,000-pound
($1,567) face amount, to 110.415. Two-year note yields were two
basis points higher at 0.64 percent.  Asset Purchases  The 8.75 percent 2017 security fell 0.285 to 139.69 after
rising to as high as 140.78 before the BOE operation.  The Bank of  England  last week boosted its asset-purchase
program, known as quantitative easing, by 75 billion pounds to
275 billion pounds in a bid to revive U.K. growth. The central
bank, which expects to complete the new round of purchases in
four months, said slowing global growth and the turmoil in
 Europe  threaten the recovery.  The euro rose against the dollar and the yen after German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
pledged to deliver a plan to help banks and repeated a
commitment to keep Greece in the single-currency area.  “There’s a general market selloff on hopes that Europe’s
about to get its house in order,” Wraith said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
