Indian stocks rose for a second day
as concern eased the European debt crisis may escalate and hurt
local exporters after the leaders of Germany and  France  pledged
to shield banks.  Tata Motors Ltd., the owner of Jaguar Land Rover, jumped to
a two-month high. Infosys Ltd., the software maker that gets 21
percent of its sales from Europe, rallied for a third day.  The BSE India Sensitive Index, or Sensex, gained 324.69, or
2 percent, to 16,557.23 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai.
Companies in the gauge trade at 14 times future profits, down
from 21.5 times in March 2010. The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the
National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. advanced 1.9 percent to
4,979.60 and its October futures settled at 5,000.  “Global factors are determining Indian share movements,”
Ajit Dayal, Chairman of Quantum Asset Management Ltd., said in
an interview with Bloomberg UTV today. “Indian investors do not
need to worry about local factors. In terms of valuations, it’s
a very good time to continue buying into Indian shares.”  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said European policy makers
will do “everything necessary” to ensure banks have enough
capital, while  Nicolas Sarkozy  said they would deliver a plan by
the Nov. 3 Group of 20 summit, as the two leaders responded to
pressure to defuse turmoil that has raged for 18 months.  Tata Motors, the nation’s biggest truckmaker, surged 7.3
percent to 170.75 rupees, the highest price in two months. DLF
Ltd., the top developer, gained 4.8 percent to 228.65 rupees.  Reliance, Infosys  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , the owner of the world’s largest
refining complex, added 3.3 percent to 829.25 rupees after the
Financial Times reported yesterday, citing people familiar with
the matter, the company is close to a deal with Walt Disney
Co.’s local unit to get games and other content for its
telecommunications service.  Infosys rose 3.2 percent to 2,589.95 rupees. The software
maker will announce results on Oct. 12, the first company in the
Nifty to post earnings for the quarter ending Sept. 30. It may
report a profit of 18.9 billion rupees ($384 million), up from
17.4 billion a year earlier, according to the median estimate of
27 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Companies such as Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services
Ltd.,  Asia ’s biggest computer-services company, earn about
three-quarters of revenue from abroad. TCS climbed 1.5 percent
to 1,064.7 rupees.  Bharti Airtel Ltd., the largest cell-phone operator, lead
its peers higher after the government said it plans to increase
the availability of airwaves to operators. The stock rose 2.5
percent to 363.55 rupees. Idea Cellular Ltd. added 2.1 percent
to 92.1 rupees.  Citigroup Rating  Citigroup raised its recommendation on Indian stocks to
“neutral,” citing a drop in global commodity prices, lower
share valuations and a short-term peak in borrowing costs,
according to a report dated Oct. 6.  The Sensex has fallen 19 percent this year on concern the
central bank’s record interest-rate increases may compound the
effects of  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis and slowing economic
growth in the U.S. on company profits.  Earnings for 47 percent of the companies in the Sensex
trailed estimates in the June quarter, compared with 33 percent
that missed forecasts in the previous quarter, Bloomberg data
show. Industrial output grew 3.3 percent in July, the slowest
pace in almost two years, and data for August will be released
on Oct. 12. A Bloomberg News survey of 17 economists expects
production to rise to 4.7 percent from a year earlier.  Overseas funds have pulled out a net 28.3 billion rupees
from local equities this year, data on the market regulator’s
 website  show. They withdrew a net $2.4 billion in August, the
most since October 2008, the data show. That caused the Sensex
to drop 8.4 percent that month, the worst in at least a decade.  “The price of Indian shares will continue to be hostage to
what foreigners think of  India  and the world,” Quantum’s Dayal
said.  India’s $1.2 trillion stock market, Asia’s fourth-biggest,
is influenced by foreign fund flows. Inflows from abroad surged
to a record $29.4 billion in 2010, making the Sensex the best
performer among the world’s top 10 markets. The largest-ever
outflow in 2008 led the biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
