The euro and Standard & Poor’s 500
Index futures rose, while commodities climbed a fourth day after
German and French leaders pledged to devise a plan to stem the
debt crisis in three weeks and as the U.S. showed signs of
sustaining its economic recovery. European stocks erased gains.  Europe’s 17-nation currency advanced 0.8 percent against
the dollar and strengthened 0.7 percent versus the yen at 8:24
a.m. in  London . S&P 500 futures added 0.9 percent, while the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index swung between gains and losses, following
a three-day, 6.7 percent jump. S&P’s GSCI Index of raw materials
increased 0.5 percent, paced by wheat, silver and oil.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  will deliver a plan to recapitalize European
banks and address the Greek debt crisis by the Nov. 3 Group of
20 summit. Belgium will buy part of failing Dexia SA and provide
security for depositors. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Macroeconomic Advisers LLC raised their U.S. growth forecasts in
the third quarter, after an Oct. 7 report showing a 103,000 rise
in payrolls capped a string of stronger-than-projected data.  “The market was met with some above-expectations data, as
well as some warm and fuzzy talk out of the EU about the banking
sector, so ultimately the rally will likely continue” for the
next few weeks, Nick Maroutsos, who oversees the equivalent of
about $4 billion at Sydney-based Kapstream Capital, said in a
Bloomberg Television interview.  ‘Everything Necessary’  The euro traded at $1.3485 and rose to 103.49 yen after
Merkel said European leaders will do “everything necessary” to
ensure that banks have enough capital. The shared currency
weakened on Oct. 7 after  Fitch Ratings  lowered Spain’s foreign
and local currency long-term issuer default ratings to AA- from
AA+ and cut Italy’s ratings to A+ from AA-, citing an
“intensification” of the region’s sovereign-debt crisis.  Belgium’s purchase of the local consumer-lending unit of
Dexia will end a 15-year cross-border experiment with  France 
after the European debt crisis deepened. The Belgian federal
government will pay 4 billion euros ($5.4 billion) for the
division and guarantee 60 percent of a so-called bad bank to be
set up for Dexia’s troubled assets, Finance Minister  Didier
Reynders  said at a press conference today in Brussels.  The Australian dollar strengthened 0.7 percent to 98.37 U.S.
cents, while New Zealand’s currency climbed 0.7 percent to 77.48
U.S. cents. The ringgit strengthened for a fifth day, rising 0.8
percent to 3.1345 per dollar after an Oct. 7 report showed
Malaysian exports rose in August at the fastest pace in four
months and Prime Minister Najib Razak said economic growth may
quicken in 2012.  U.S. Economy  Futures indicate the  S&P 500  may rebound from its 0.8
percent decline on Oct. 7. The gauge had climbed as much as 0.6
percent after the Labor Department report on September payrolls,
which topped the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists for a rise of 60,000. Treasuries fell on Oct. 7,
pushing 10-year note yields up last week by the most since July.  “The payroll number takes some of the negativity away from
the U.S. economic outlook but the euro zone will continue to
dominate sentiment,” said  Imre Speizer , a strategist in
Auckland at Westpac Banking Corp., Australia’s second-largest
lender.  Data later this week may show U.S. retail sales increased
in September at the fastest pace in six months, helping to ease
concern the U.S. recovery is faltering. Economists at Goldman
Sachs and  Macroeconomic Advisers  lifted their third-quarter
growth forecasts to 2.5 percent from about 2 percent.  Earnings  Earnings per share for the S&P 500, excluding financial
companies, may have increased 14 percent in the third quarter,
the smallest gain since the end of 2009, analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg show. Alcoa Inc., the biggest U.S.
aluminum producer, will report earnings Oct. 11 after U.S.
markets close, the first member of  the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  to do so for the third quarter.  Investors are increasing bearish trades around the world by
the most in at least five years, convinced the lowest valuations
since 2009 will prove no barrier to losses. Borrowed shares, an
indication of short selling, climbed to 11.6 percent of stock
last month from 9.5 percent in July, the biggest increase since
at least 2006, according to information compiled for Bloomberg
by  Data Explorers , a London-based research firm.  Europe , Asia  The Stoxx 600 earlier rose as much as 0.6 percent.

percent in  China , where financial markets opened for trading
following a one-week holiday. Financial markets in  Japan  and
Taiwan are closed for holidays today.  Agile Property Holdings Ltd. slumped 13 percent, the
biggest decliner on the MSCI regional index, after housing sales
slid during China’s week-long holiday. Hanjin Heavy Industries &
Construction Co. jumped 15 percent in  Seoul  after Tong Yang
Securities Inc. said the shipbuilder may resolve disputes over
job cuts with workers.  Oil for November delivery rose 0.6 percent to $83.51 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , extending a three-
day, 9.7 percent jump. December-delivery wheat rallied 1.9

Plc prices show. That’s on track for the lowest level since Sept.
