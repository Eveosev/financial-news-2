Ireland’s sovereign debt interest
costs will absorb about 20 percent of the country’s tax revenues
by the middle of the decade, according to the  Finance
Ministry .  While the country’s debt is expected to peak at 120 percent
of gross domestic product in 2013, a proposed  interest rate  cut
in its bailout program may reduce that ratio, the ministry said
in a presentation published on its website, dated
Sept. 30 and published Oct. 7.  Sixty four directors in the country’s banks have left over
the past three years, with four non-executive and six executive
directors remaining, it said. The central bank is carrying out
fitness and probity tests on directors in government-supported
lenders who wish to remain in their posts from January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
