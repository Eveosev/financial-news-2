Uganda ’s shilling weakened for the
second day as oil importers and telecommunication companies
bought dollars to import supplies.  The currency of East Africa’s third-biggest economy
depreciated 0.2 percent to 2,870 at 11:44 a.m. in the capital,
Kampala, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It closed at
2,865 on Oct. 7.  “We are seeing demand for the dollar continuing to pile in
the market,” Faisal Bukenya, the head of  currency trading  at
Barclays Bank Uganda Ltd., said by phone from Kampala. “Demand
is coming from the energy and telecommunication sectors.”  Uganda’s shilling reached 2,897.50 on Sept. 23, the weakest
since June 1993. The currency of Africa’s second-biggest coffee
exporter has slipped 20 percent this year to the dollar, making
it the second-worst performer after  Kenya ’s shilling. A surge in
food and fuel prices pushed inflation to a more than 18-year
high of 28.3 percent this month from 22 percent in August, the
Uganda Bureau of Statistics said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
