White sugar’s premium over raw
sweetener may fall as much as 39 percent by the end of the year
as European, Indian, Thai and Central American production
surges, according to Swiss Sugar Brokers.  White, or refined, sugar for March delivery on NYSE Liffe
in  London  was $81.7623 a metric ton more expensive by 2:37 p.m.
local time than the March raw-sugar contract on ICE Futures U.S.
in  New York , data on Bloomberg showed. The premium may fall to
$50 to $60 a ton by the end of the year,  Naim Beydoun , a broker
at Rolle, Switzerland-based Swiss Sugar Brokers, said by e-mail
in response to questions today.  “The white premium is already showing some sign of fatigue
hanging close to the $100 level and will ultimately be weighed
not only from the Indian supply, but also from the EU export
quotas, Russia, Thai whites and Centrals,” Beydoun wrote in a
report e-mailed yesterday.  Cane production in  Thailand , the world’s second-largest
sugar exporter, may climb to 100 million tons, setting a record
for a second year, according to Thai Sugar Millers Corp. Output
in  India , the second-largest producer after  Brazil , will rise to
26.2 million tons in the 2011-12 season and exports may total 3
million to 4 million tons, Sucden, the trading arm of Sucres et
Denrees SA, estimates.  European Union sugar production is expected to exceed 18
million tons this year, up from 15.4 million tons in 2010 and
17.5 million tons in 2009, French crops office FranceAgriMer
said Sept. 30. Russia’s sugar output from beets is expected to
be 4.5 million to 5 million tons this marketing year, according
to First Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov.  Global sugar output will exceed demand by 4.2 million tons
in the marketing year that started this month, the  International
Sugar Organization  estimated. Raw-sugar exports will likely fall
782,000 tons to 31.3 million tons as shipments of refined sugar
gain 1.1 million tons to 20.9 million tons, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
