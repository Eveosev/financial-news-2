Joerg Asmussen, nominee for
membership of the European Central Bank’s Executive Board, said
recapitalization of banks should be done on the basis of the
European Union’s 27 member-states to avoid a “stigma effect.”  Recapitalization should be carried out for all
systemically-important financial institutions, Asmussen said at
a hearing on his candidacy in the European Parliament today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
