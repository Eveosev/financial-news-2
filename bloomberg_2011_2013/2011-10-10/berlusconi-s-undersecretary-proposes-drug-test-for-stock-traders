An undersecretary for Italian Prime
Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  has proposed a drug-testing program
for stock traders, citing studies that point to a “worrisome”
link between substance abuse and market fluctuations.  Some Italians may have entrusted savings to people “not
capable of making decisions” due to drug use, Carlo Giovanardi
said in a phone interview today from Belluno, Italy.  Giovanardi, who’s responsible for the government’s family
and  drug-abuse prevention policy , said he plans to contact
regulators and industry groups working with the stock exchange
to discuss the drug-testing plan. The program could be developed
without the passage of a new law, he said.  The Italian exchange,  Borsa Italiana , didn’t have an
immediate comment, said a spokeswoman, who declined to be
identified citing policy.  Giovanardi, who last year promoted a voluntary drug test
for members of parliament, also cited “U.S. studies” suggesting
recent market turmoil may have been amplified by “people who’ve
lost touch with reality” due to drug use. The undersecretary
said cocaine use has a “devastating” effect on individuals,
leading to “brain meltdown.”  Giovanardi’s proposal was earlier reported by the
 KlausCondicio web channel .  Italy  on Sept. 28 extended a ban on short-selling of
financial shares to Nov. 11. The country’s benchmark FTSE MIB
index has fallen 20 percent this year compared with a 17 percent
decline for the Stoxx Europe 600.  To contact the reporter on this story:
