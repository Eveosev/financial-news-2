Argentine tax collection from
soybean export duties fell 37 percent in September from a year
earlier as the price for the commodity declines, El Cronista
said, citing a research report.  The government of President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner,
which shares with provinces part of the soybean export duties,
sent the provinces 570 million pesos ($135 million) last month,
down from 902 million pesos a year earlier, the Buenos Aires-
based newspaper said, citing a report by the Argentine Institute
of Fiscal Analysis.  The funds that provinces received from the tax in the first
nine months of the year rose 5.7 percent from a year earlier, El
Cronista said.  Soybean futures have declined 15.1 percent in  Chicago  this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
