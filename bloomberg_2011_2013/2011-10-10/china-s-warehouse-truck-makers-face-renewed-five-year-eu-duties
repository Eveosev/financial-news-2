The European Union renewed tariffs
on warehouse trucks from  China  for another five years to curb
competition for EU producers including  Italy ’s Lifter Srl and a
Swedish unit of  Toyota Industries Corp. (6201)   The EU re-imposed the duties as high as 46.7 percent on
imports from China of hand pallet trucks, which are used for
moving materials placed on pallets. The EU introduced the levies
in 2005 for five years to punish Chinese exporters such as
 Ningbo Ruyi Joint Stock Co.  for selling the manually powered
equipment in  Europe  below cost, a practice known as dumping.  “There is a likelihood of continuation of dumping should
measures be removed,” the 27-nation EU said in a decision today
in Luxembourg. The five-year renewal will take effect after
being published in the  Official Journal  by Oct. 20.  China’s share of the EU market for hand pallet trucks
increased to 83 percent in the 12 months through June 2010 from
around 78 percent in 2007, according to the bloc. Over that
period, total EU consumption of the equipment declined 40
percent to 468,557 pieces, said the bloc.  Lifter, a subsidiary of  Pramac SpA (PRA) , and BT Products AB, a
unit of  Japan ’s Toyota Industries, asked in April 2010 for a
prolongation of the anti-dumping duties. The companies, which
the EU says account for “almost the total” bloc-wide
production of hand pallet trucks, claimed that letting the trade
protection expire would probably result in further dumping by
Chinese exporters and injury to the European industry.  In response, the EU in July 2010 opened a probe that
culminated with today’s decision. The original anti-dumping
duties, which had been due to lapse in July 2010, automatically
stayed in place during the 15-month inquiry into whether to
renew them. The levies range from 7.6 percent to 46.7 percent,
depending on the Chinese manufacturer.  In June 2009, the EU extended the maximum duty to  Thailand 
after concluding that Chinese exporters used the country to
evade the levy. The bloc narrowed the scope of the tariffs in
July 2008 by excluding equipment that lifts, stacks or weighs.
Today’s renewal maintains those two decisions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
