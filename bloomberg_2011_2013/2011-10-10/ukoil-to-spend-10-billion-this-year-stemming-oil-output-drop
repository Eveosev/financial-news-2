OAO Lukoil,  Russia ’s second-largest
oil producer, plans to increase spending to $10 billion this
year and more in 2012 as it taps deposits abroad and works to
stem declining output at home.  Lukoil will start projects in  Iraq , Russia’s Caspian Sea
and Uzbekistan in the “near future,” Chief Executive Officer
Vagit Alekperov told news service Interfax in comments confirmed
by his spokesman, Gleb Ovsyannikov. Capital spending amounted to
$6.84 billion in 2010, Lukoil said in a  website  presentation.  In the first half of this year, Lukoil’s crude and natural-
gas output fell for the first time in the company’s history as
Russian taxes drove it to seek more projects abroad. The Moscow-
based producer plans to return Russian output to growth in 2013.  While the proposed investment is “in line” with the
company’s development program according to Alekperov, it’s
negative for the stock, VTB Capital wrote in a note today. The
number exceeds the bank’s estimate for Lukoil’s 2011
investments, VTB said.  Lukoil has dropped 18 percent in Moscow trading in the past
six months as global economic growth slows, stoking concern that
demand for crude and fuels will decline. The shares traded up
3.5 percent at 1,670.70 rubles at the 6:45 p.m. close today.  Lukoil may spend $4 billion to $5 billion a year over the
next five years developing projects abroad, Andrei Kuzyaev, head
of the overseas division, said this month. Its Uzbek gas output
may quadruple to 20 billion cubic meters a year, or 360,000
barrels of oil equivalent a day, by 2017, he said. That’s equal
to 17 percent of Lukoil’s 2.16 million-barrels-a-day output in
the first half.  OAO Rosneft, Russia’s largest oil producer, said in
February that it expected  capital spending  to increase 23
percent to about $11 billion this year. The company spent $8.93
billion last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
