Adidas AG (ADS) , the world’s second-
largest sporting-goods maker, expects record soccer sales next
year as the European championship finals take place in Ukraine
and Poland, Chief Executive Officer Herbert Hainer said.  Revenue in the category will exceed the 1.5 billion euros
($2 billion) of 2010, after being little changed this year,
Hainer said at a press briefing in Moscow today.  “We will definitely have a new record here,” he said.  Adidas is the official partner of European soccer’s
governing body UEFA for the Euro 2012 finals, which start in
June. The Herzogenaurach, Germany-based company plans to expand
its market-leading position in Ukraine and attain leadership in
Poland by 2015, he said of the tournament’s host nations.  Russia  and the Commonwealth of Independent States will
become Adidas’s third-biggest market “in two-to-three years,”
Hainer said. Sales in the region will be more than 1 billion
euros by 2013, he said.  Adidas, which has supplied sportswear to Soviet national
teams since the 1960s and opened its Russian office in 1992,
will have 800 stores in Russia and the CIS countries by the end
of 2011 and will add another 400 by 2015, Hainer said.  Russia is Adidas’s fourth-biggest market globally after
 North America ,  China  and Japan. The three biggest sales regions
are expected to contribute 50 percent of Adidas’s revenue
growth, or 2.5 billion euros, by 2015, the CEO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
