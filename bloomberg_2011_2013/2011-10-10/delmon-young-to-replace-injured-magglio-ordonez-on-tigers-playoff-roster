Delmon Young replaced injured
outfielder Magglio Ordonez on the Detroit Tigers’ American
League Championship Series roster, the Major League Baseball
team said.  Ordonez broke his ankle prior to the start of the best-of-
seven series, which the Texas Rangers lead 1-0.  Young, also an outfielder, hadn’t been playing due to a
strained oblique muscle.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
