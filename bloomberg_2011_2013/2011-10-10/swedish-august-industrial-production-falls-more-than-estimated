Swedish industrial production fell
more than estimated in August as a deepening European debt
crisis threatens to delay a recovery and hurt exports.  Industrial production fell a monthly 3.1 percent in August
after rising a revised 2.3 percent the previous month,
Stockholm-based  Statistics Sweden  said today. Production was
expected to fall 1.5 percent, according to the median estimate
in a Bloomberg survey of eight economists. Output rose an annual
5.6 percent, compared with an expected 10 percent.  Sweden ’s central bank on Sept. 7 kept its benchmark rate
unchanged at 2 percent, interrupting a cycle of seven
consecutive increases since July last year, citing “concern
over public finances abroad.”  It predicted growth in the Swedish economy will slow to 1.7
percent in 2012 from 4.5 percent this year as exports, which
account for about half of Swedish economic output, will be hurt
by the global economic slowdown.  To contact the reporter on this story:
