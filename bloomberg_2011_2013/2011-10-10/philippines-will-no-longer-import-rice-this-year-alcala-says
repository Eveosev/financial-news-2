The  Philippines  will no longer
import rice this year even after recent typhoons that damaged
crops, Agriculture Secretary Proceso Alcala said in  Manila 
today, after a meeting of the National Food Authority council.  The import plan for next year will be discussed in November
once an audit of the damaged crops and likely harvest for the
remainder of 2011 have been completed, Alcala said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
