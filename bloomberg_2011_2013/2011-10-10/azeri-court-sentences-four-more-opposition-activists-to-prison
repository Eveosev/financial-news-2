A court in  Azerbaijan  sentenced four
more opposition members to prison terms ranging from 1 1/2 years
to three years in connection with political protests in April in
Baku, the oil-rich Caspian Sea country’s capital.  This brought to 13 the total number of opposition activists
who have been jailed for participating in rallies that sought to
replicate the uprisings in Egypt and  Tunisia .  Judge Sahin Abdullayev of Baku’s Nasimi District Court
convicted the members of the opposition parties Equality and the
People’s Front of Azerbaijan of disrupting public order,
resisting the police and damaging private property, defense
lawyer Osman Kazimli said by phone.  “This was a politically ordered verdict,” Kazimli said.  Supporters outside the courtroom chanted “Freedom” and
sang Azerbaijan’s national anthem in protest. Police dispersed
the demonstrators and detained three of them, according to the
private news agency Turan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
