Dubai Group’s debt restructuring may
be completed by the end of this year or early next year, said
the chief executive officer of Noor Islamic Bank PJSC, one the
banks negotiating the deal.  “Negotiations are still under way, but it will be a matter
of extending maturities,” Hussain al Qemzi told reporters in
 Abu Dhabi  today. “We don’t have a deadline. It can probably go
to the end of the year, or early next year. But still, this is
only my hope.”  Dubai Group, controlled by Dubai Holding LLC, is one of
several companies in the emirate seeking to alter terms on
borrowings after property prices slumped amid the global
financial crisis, limiting access to credit markets. Dubai
World, the state-owned holding company that’s restructuring
about $25 billion of debt, signed a final deal with creditors
last month, marking the end of a credit crisis that roiled
markets in 2009.  Dubai Group is restructuring $10 billion of liabilities, up
from an original estimate of $6 billion, two people with
knowledge of the discussions said in April. The company
appointed eight banks to represent creditors in two committees
in January to help speed up agreement on the restructuring.  Paris-based Natixis SA’s Nexgen unit and Dubai-based
 Mashreqbank PSC (MASQ)  make up the committee of secured lenders,
whose loans are backed by assets.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc (RBS)  and  Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES) , the  United Arab Emirates ’ biggest
bank, lead the group of partially secured and unsecured lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
