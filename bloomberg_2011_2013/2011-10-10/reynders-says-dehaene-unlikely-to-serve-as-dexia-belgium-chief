Belgian Finance Minister  Didier
Reynders  said Jean-Luc Dehaene is unlikely to serve as head of
 Dexia SA (DEXB) ’s nationalized Belgian unit.  “I don’t think Jean-Luc Dehaene will take over in  Belgium ,
but to choose the president I’d really like to have specialist
firms come up with candidates from among professionlas in this
sector,” Reynders said today on Belgium’s RTBF radio.  Reynders said the issue of bonuses for employees of the
Belgian bank will be “decided easily since the state will be a
100 percent shareholder.”  Elio Di Rupo, the president of the French-speaking
Socialist Party who’s leading talks on creating a new government
in Belgium, supported the caretaker government’s decision on
Dexia, Reynders said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
