Brazil ’s central bank will miss its
2012 inflation target by at least one percentage point,
according to estimates made by a congressional budget committee.  Consumer prices will rise 5.5 percent or more next year,
Alcir Gurgacz, the senator responsible for the congressional
budget committee’s revenue report, said in interview today.
Central Bank President Alexandre Tombini has repeatedly pledged
to slow inflation to the 4.5 percent midpoint of the bank’s
target range in 2012.  The government’s revenue will be around 20 billion reais
higher ($11.3 billion) than the 1,097 trillion reais forecasted
by President Dilma Rousseff’s government, Gurgacz said. The
senator will present his report to the committee tomorrow
morning.  Consumer prices rose 7.31 percent in the year through
September, exceeding the 6.5 percent upper limit of the central
bank’s target range for a sixth straight month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
