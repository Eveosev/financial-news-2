Zatlers Reform Party and Unity,
which together won 42 of 100 seats in  Latvia ’s parliamentary
elections held last month, called on the president to nominate
Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis for another term.  The two parties will meet today to discuss the formation of
the government and call on President Andris Berzins to name
Dombrovskis again to lead the government, the two parties said
in a joint press release today.  The Reform and Unity parties were unable to form a four-
party coalition with a nationalist party and Harmony Center,
which represents the Russian minority, according to the
statement. Today, the parties will try to agree on a third
coalition member, either forming a coalition of 56 votes with
the  National Alliance , or one with 73 seats with Harmony, which
won more seats than any other single party.  “The duty of the next government will be to introduce
reforms in higher education, work to reduce the tax burden on
labor and hold a national vote on questions on how the president
is elected and the expansion of the office’s functions,” the
statement from the two parties said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
