Britain’s leading accounting
regulator criticized French auditors for allowing France’s banks
to report smaller losses on Greek  government bonds  than some
European competitors, the Financial Times reported.  Stephen Haddrill, the chief executive officer of the
 Financial Reporting Council , told the newspaper he doesn’t see
“strong auditing going on” in France.  In the first half of this year, various French banks and
insurance companies posted 21 percent losses on “available for
sale” Greek government bonds, rather than the writedown of 50
percent implied by market prices, arguing that trading was too
sparse to be meaningful, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
