Latvian consumer-price growth slowed
in September from the previous month as the cost of health care,
entertainment and culture fell.  The inflation rate fell to 4.6 percent from 4.7 percent in
the previous month, the Riga-based  statistics office  said on its
website today. The median estimate of four economists in a
Bloomberg survey was 4.7 percent. On the month, consumer prices
grew 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
