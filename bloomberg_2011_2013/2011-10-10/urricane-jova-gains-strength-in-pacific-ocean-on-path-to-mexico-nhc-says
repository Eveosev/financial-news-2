Hurricane Jovaâ€™s winds grew to 125
miles (201 kilometers) per hour from 120 earlier in the day as
the Category 3 storm moves east in the Pacific toward  Mexico ,
the U.S. National Hurricane Center said in an advisory at about
10:45 a.m. East Coast time.  Tropical Storm Irwin lost power, its winds weakening to 40
mph from 50 mph, as it follows Jova east, the center said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
