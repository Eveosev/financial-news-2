European stocks advanced, with the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index posting its biggest four-day rally since
November 2008, as the leaders of Germany and France gave
themselves three weeks to create a plan to recapitalize banks.  BP Plc contributed the most to the gauge’s advance. Premier
Oil Plc rose 3.3 percent after HSBC Holdings Plc upgraded its
shares.  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  plunged 9.2 percent after saying it
will post a full-year loss because of writedowns at its units in
Hungary and Romania.  Dexia SA (DEXB)  dropped 4.7 percent after earlier
falling as much as 36 percent when trading in the shares
resumed.  The benchmark Stoxx 600 advanced 1.7 percent to 235.94 at
the 4:30 p.m. close in  London , extending the gauge’s rally over
the last four days to 8.5 percent. National benchmark indexes
rose in 15 of the 18 western European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE
100 Index gained 1.8 percent. France’s CAC 40 Index climbed 2.1
percent and Germany’s DAX Index jumped 3 percent. All three
gauges posted their biggest four-day rallies since 2008.  “I believe they will come up with something,” Andy Brough,  executive director  at Schroder Investment Management
Ltd. in London, which has about $324 billion in assets under
management, said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “What the
market wants to see is can we get a position and move forward.”  Angela Merkel  and  Nicolas Sarkozy , racing to stamp out the
sovereign-debt crisis that threatens to engulf the financial
system, set an end-of-October deadline to devise a plan to
recapitalize banks, get Greece on the right track and fix
 Europe ’s economic governance.  Recapitalizing Lenders  “By the end of the month, we will have responded to the
crisis issue and to the vision issue,” France’s president said
in Berlin yesterday at a joint briefing with the German
chancellor before they dined at her office. Sarkozy said they
will deliver a plan by the Nov. 3 Group of 20 summit.  The Stoxx 600 advanced 2.6 percent last week as the  Bank of
England  expanded its bond-purchase program and after Merkel said
she’s ready to discuss recapitalizing lenders. The gauge has
still retreated 19 percent since this year’s high on Feb. 17 and
is trading at 9.9 times its companies’ estimated earnings, near
the cheapest since March 2009, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  BP gained 2.9 percent to 405.15 pence as Europe’s second-
largest oil company made the biggest contribution to the Stoxx
600’s rally.  Premier Oil Plc (PMO)  gained 3.3 percent to 372.4 pence. HSBC
lifted its recommendation on the stock to “overweight” from
“underweight.”  Petroleum Geo-Services ASA (PGS)  and  Aker Solutions ASA (AKSO)  surged 11
percent to 63.50 kroner and 10 percent to 59.60 kroner,
respectively.  Ferrovial Shares Surge  Ferrovial SA (FER)  advanced 6.5 percent to 9.08 euros. The
company  agreed  to sell 5.9 percent of BAA’s parent company, FGP
Topco Ltd. to Alinda Capital Partners for 280 million pounds
($439 million), reducing its indirect holding in the owner of
London’s Heathrow airport to 49.99 percent.  Maurel SA rallied 5.5 percent to 13.42 euros. The company
said it has found oil sandstones at a well at the Sabanero
license in Colombia and oil samples taken have confirmed the
field extension to the north east. In a statement, Maurel said
it will drill three more wells in 2011 and 2012.  ABB Ltd. (ABBN) , the world’s largest maker of power-transmission
gear, added 3.5 percent to 16.99 Swiss francs. Jefferies Group
Inc. raised its recommendation on the company’s shares to
“buy” from “hold.”  Erste Group, eastern Europe’s second-biggest lender,
slumped 9.2 percent to 18.80 euros. The bank said it will post a
full-year loss of as much as 800 million euros ($1.1 billion)
after writedowns at its Hungarian and Romanian units.  Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) , eastern Europe’s third-
biggest lender, plunged 4.7 percent to 21.20 euros.  Dexia Resumes Trading  Dexia dropped 4.7 percent to 80.5 euro cents after agreeing
to a breakup plan. The Belgian federal government will pay 4
billion euros for the local unit and guarantee 60 percent of a
so-called bad bank that Dexia will set up for its troubled
assets, Finance Minister  Didier Reynders  said. The sale will cut
Dexia’s short-term funding requirement by more than 14 billion
euros, the French-Belgian bank said.  Dexia will sell assets, including its Luxembourg unit and
its French municipal-lending arm, to give the bad bank capital
to absorb future losses. Dexia’s breakup became inevitable after
its short-term funding evaporated.  Konecranes Oyj (KCR1V)  sank 2.2 percent to 14.97 euros. The company
cut its forecast for full-year operating profit, excluding
restructuring costs, saying it will be flat compared with last
year. The company had predicted an increase in operating profit
this year.  CSM (CSM)  NV slumped 20 percent to 11.22 euros, the largest
plunge since November 2008, after the company said that its
second-half earnings will fall short of its forecasts. The
world’s biggest maker of bakery ingredients also said it plans
to reduce costs by 50 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
