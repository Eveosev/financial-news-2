Ghana ’s cedi weakened for a second
day as overseas-based investors bought dollars to repatriate
earnings from bonds.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
depreciated as much as 0.4 percent to 1.6233 per dollar before
trading 0.3 percent down at 1.6220 per dollar as of 1:17 p.m. in
Accra, the capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There was dollar buying by offshore investors today,”
Jacob Brobbey, a currency trader at the local unit of Barclays
Bank Plc, said in a telephone interview. “Some offshore
investors have received coupon payments over the past week.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
