A one-day strike by workers of  Coal
India Ltd. (COAL) , the world’s biggest producer of the fuel, may result
in the company losing 1.2 billion rupees ($25 million) of sales,
Chairman Nirmal Chandra Jha said.  The company may lose 1 million metric tons of production,
after workers walked off their jobs today, demanding higher
payments, Jha said today in a telephone interview from Coal
 India ’s Kolkata headquarters. The workers will be back at their
jobs tomorrow, he said.  Five labor unions, including the Indian National Trade
Union Congress supported by the nation’s ruling Congress party,
are demanding the company give 23,500 rupees to every employee
as an extra payment during the festival season, almost 57
percent more than the 15,000 rupees paid last year.  Coal India 
has about 450 billion rupees of cash in hand, Jha said in a
Sept. 22 interview.  Coal India’s shares gained 1.8 percent to 343.65 rupees
after falling as much as 2 percent.  The company’s production during the five months ended Aug.
31 fell 6.7 percent short of a target of 163.5 million tons,
after heavy showers flooded mines. The gap may have widened in
the last month, Jha said.  “Our production growth last year was nearly zero and this
year there is a drop in output,” he said.  Environmental restrictions and delays in land acquisitions
slowed Coal India’s projects, even as demand for coal continues
to increase. Domestic supply during the year ending March 31 may
fall short of demand by 114 million tons, compared with a 83
million ton gap the previous year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
