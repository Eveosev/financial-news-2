LyondellBasel Industries NV will
begin starting up units at its Berre refinery in southern  France 
today after workers agreed to end their strike, according to a
spokesman.  Refining, olefins and polymers units at Berre will be
restarted over the week,  David Harpole  said by e-mail.  Workers at the site went on strike after the company
announced Sept. 27 a plan to permanently shut the refinery after
failing to find a buyer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
