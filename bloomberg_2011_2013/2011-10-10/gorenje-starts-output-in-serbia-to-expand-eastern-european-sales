Gorenje Group d.d. started
production of washing machines at its plant in  Serbia  as
Slovenia’s biggest appliance maker seeks to increase sales in
eastern  Europe .  Gorenje started producing plastic sinks and washing
machines in the eastern Serbian town of Zajecar in an investment
worth 2.9 million euros ($4 million) that will be sold to
consumers in Serbia,  Ukraine ,  Russia  and other markets in the
region, the Velenje, Slovenia-based company said in a  statement 
to the Ljubljana stock exchange today.  The plant in Serbia will allow Gorenje to benefit from a
customs agreement signed by Serbia with Russia and some other
countries of eastern Europe, Gorenje said.  Gorenje, which is Slovenia’s second-biggest exporter,
operates three units in Serbia, including refrigeration
appliances plant in Valjevo and a water heater plant in Stara
Pazova, employing about 1,200 people.  The announcement came as the Ljubljana stock exchange
closed for the day. Gorenje rose 15 eurocents, or 2.6 percent,
to close at 5.83 euros in Ljubljana, before the announcement.
The stock has lost 55 percent of its value this year, compared
with a 27.7 percent drop for the benchmark SBITOP index of six
most-traded shares in the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
