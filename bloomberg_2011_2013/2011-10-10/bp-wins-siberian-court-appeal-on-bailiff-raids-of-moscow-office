BP Plc (BP/)  won an appeal against a
Tyumen court decision that had allowed document searches of its
Moscow offices as a minority owner in OAO TNK-BP Holding seeks
damages after the collapse of an alliance with OAO Rosneft.  BP won the appeal in an Omsk court today, the U.K. explorer
and lawyers for the shareholder, Andrey Prokhorov, said in
separate e-mailed statements. Bailiffs conducted a two-day
search of BP Exploration Operating Co. in Moscow starting on
Aug. 31.  Prokhorov is seeking damages from BP and the U.K.
explorer’s representatives on the TNK-BP Holding board, saying
the collapse in May of a planned Arctic alliance and share swap
between BP and Rosneft caused TNK-BP to lose out on potential
profit of 154 billion rubles ($4.8 billion), according to his
lawyer’s statement.  “We can ask the court to demand the required documents in
the course of the hearing,” Prokhorov’s lawyer, Dmitry
Chepurenko, said in the statement.  BP said the Tyumen court’s earlier decision had no merit as
Prokhorov holds less than 1 percent in a minimum threshold
needed to sue the board members, and because the court had no
jurisdiction, according to the e-mailed statement from its
Moscow office. BP said TNK-BP suffered no lost profit as Rosneft
didn’t consider it a possible partner.  Prokhorov holds 0.0000106 percent of  TNK-BP Holding (TNBP) ,
according to BP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
