European Union President  Herman Van Rompuy  pushed back a planned meeting of government leaders by a
week to Oct. 23 as the region seeks to stem the Greece-
triggered debt crisis.  The summit will be preceded by a meeting of EU finance
ministers,  Van Rompuy  said today in a statement.  “This timing will allow to finalize our comprehensive 
strategy on the euro-area sovereign-debt crisis covering a
number of interrelated issues,” Van Rompuy said. “Significant
progress has been accomplished in the implementation of the July
package,” he said.  “Further elements are needed to address the situation in
Greece, the bank recapitalization and the enhanced efficiency of
stabilisation tools,” Van Rompuy said. “These elements are
closely related to the outcome of the troika mission to  Greece 
on the state of implementation of the program and to the
Commission’s plans for a framework for the bank
recapitalizations, taking into account the work of the European
Banking Authority.”  The EU’s 27 national leaders had been due to meet on Oct.
17 and euro-area leaders planned to gather on Oct. 18.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
