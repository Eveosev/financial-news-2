Redecard SA headed to a 15-month
high after a report said  Brazil ’s second-largest card payment
processor by market value dismissed about 300 employees as it
seeks to make its operations more efficient.  Redecard gained 5.1 percent to 28.60 reais at 1:34 p.m. Sao
Paulo time, the highest since June 2010. Rival Cielo SA rose 3.4
percent to 44.60 reais. The benchmark Bovespa index advanced 3.2
percent.  The company dismissed about 300 employees between July and
September, mostly in the so-called back office and customer
service departments,  Valor Economico  reported, citing an
unidentified person familiar with Redecard’s plans.  “The restructuring process will have a negative impact in
the next quarters but will improve Redecard’s margins in the
future,”  Pedro Galdi , head strategist at SLW Corretora
brokerage, said in a telephone interview from  Sao Paulo .
“Besides that, the outlook for credit-card usage in Brazil is
promising, which benefits both Redecard and Cielo.”  Part of the money saved will be reinvested in the company,
and the cost of the dismissals will be reflected in Redecard’s
third-quarter and fourth-quarter earnings reports, Valor said.  An official at Redecard’s press office who asked not to be
identified in accordance with company policy confirmed there had
been changes to the workforce to improve efficiency, without
saying how many dismissals had been made.  To contact the reporter on this story: Katerina Petroff in Sao
