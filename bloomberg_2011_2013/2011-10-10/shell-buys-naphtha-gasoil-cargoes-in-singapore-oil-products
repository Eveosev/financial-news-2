Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought naphtha
and gasoil in  Singapore , where the company is resuming some
operations at the Pulau Bukom refinery after a Sept. 28 fire.  Light Distillates  Shell bought naphtha for first-half December at $874 a
metric ton, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders
monitoring transactions on the Platts window. The seller was
Glencore International AG, which sold three times in the
previous two days.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures
declined $5.88 to $68.42 a ton at 5:45 p.m. Singapore time,
based on Bloomberg data. This crack spread, a measure of
refining profit, was the narrowest since July 7.  Middle Distillates  Vitol Group sold 150,000 barrels of gasoil, or diesel, with
0.5 percent sulfur to Shell in Singapore at $2 a barrel over
October quotes, according to the Bloomberg survey. The Geneva-
based trader also sold a similar-sized cargo with 10 parts-per-
million of sulfur to BP Plc at $2.60 over benchmark quotes.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude fell 65 cents
to $16.60 a barrel at 2:25 p.m. Singapore time, based on data
from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This crack spread was
the narrowest since Sept. 28.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil rose 5 cents to $2.50 a barrel,
PVM said. This regrade last week climbed 44 percent, the most
since May, indicating it is more profitable to produce  aviation
fuel  over diesel.  Fuel Oil   Brightoil Petroleum Holdings Ltd. bought 20,000 tons of
380-centistoke fuel oil from BP in Singapore at $7.25 a ton over
benchmark quotes, according to the Bloomberg survey. Hin Leong
Trading Pte purchased a similar-sized cargo of 180-centistoke
grade from Vitol at a $6 premium to October quotes.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 8 cents to
$4.22 a barrel at 2:25 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM.
The gap increased 58 percent last week, the most since February
2010, meaning refiners’ losses from turning crude into residual
products was growing.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade gained 25 cents to $8 a ton, based on PVM data. A widening
viscosity spread signals higher-quality fuel oil has decreased
more than bunker, or marine fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
