Ukraine’s central bank spent $1.9
billion last month to support the hryvnia as demand for foreign
currency exceeded supply, the bank said.  The  Natsionalnyi Bank Ukrainy  said it helped NAK Naftogaz
Ukrainy, Ukraine’s state-run energy company, pay for natural gas
imports in September, according to a  statement  published today
on the regulator’s website. Naftogaz paid $867 million last
month for gas deliveries, the company said last week.  Ukraine’s international reserves fell last month to the
lowest level since December to $34.95 billion from $38.2 billion
a month earlier, central bank said on Oct. 7. It was the biggest
one-month drop in Ukraine’s foreign reserves since October 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:
