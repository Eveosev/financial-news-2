The Philippine peso rose to a three-
week high after data showed U.S. companies hired more workers
than economists estimated in September, fueling optimism demand
for regional exports will grow.  American employers added 103,000 workers last month,
beating the 60,000 median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of
analysts, a Labor Department report showed on Oct. 7. The peso
gained for a fourth day before the government issues export
numbers for August tomorrow, with shipments likely to have
increased 1 percent, according to Enrico Tanuwidjaja, a
strategist at Malayan Banking Bhd. in  Singapore .  “Sentiment is much better with the jobs data, which
present good buying opportunities in Asian currencies given the
recent selloff,” he said. “We are looking for  Japan ’s recovery
to beef up Philippine exports.”  The peso climbed 0.3 percent to 43.415 per dollar as of
3:30 p.m. in  Manila , according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It reached
43.370 earlier, the strongest level since Sept. 19, after
advancing 0.4 percent last week.  Philippine exports probably declined 5.7 percent in August
from a year earlier, after shrinking 1.7 percent in July,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
nine economists.  Bond Buyback  Bonds advanced as the government said it plans to buy back
as much as $3 billion in existing foreign-currency debt. Ten-
year notes also gained as the nation received more bids than the
amount offered at a sale of securities to individuals, signaling
increasing demand.  The  Philippines  sold today a total 20 billion pesos ($461
million) of 10- and 15-year bonds to individual investors to tap
excess cash in the banking system and fund spending. The  Bureau
of the Treasury  sold 10 billion pesos of 10-year notes at 5.75
percent and the same amount of 15-year debt at 6.25 percent.
Demand amounted to was 22.98 billion pesos and 47.98 billion
pesos, respectively, it said.  “Demand was strong and that’s good for the market,” said
Fernando Mangalindan, a bond trader at Philippine Savings Bank
in Manila. “The buyback means there’s going to be less supply
in the market.”  The yield on the 6.5 percent security maturing in April
2021 dropped 12.5 basis points, or 0.125 percentage point, to
5.80 percent, according to Tradition Financial Services. The
price increased 0.93, or 93 pesos per 10,000 peso face amount,
to 105.0729.  The nation’s 4.95 percent dollar bond due January 2021
climbed for a third day. Its yield fell 14 basis points to 5.51
percent, the lowest level since Sept. 23, according to prices
from Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  The Philippine government also plans to buy back existing
“expensive” foreign-currency securities, Treasurer  Roberto Tan 
said. About $17.5 billion of worth of bonds denominated in the
dollar and euro are eligible for tender, Finance Secretary Cesar
Purisima told reporters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
