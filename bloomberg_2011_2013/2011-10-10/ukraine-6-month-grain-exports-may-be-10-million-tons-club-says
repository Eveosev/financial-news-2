Ukraine, set to become the world’s
third-biggest corn exporter, will probably ship about 10 million
metric tons of grain in the current marketing year’s first half,
according to the Ukrainian Agribusiness Club.  Deliveries may come to about 2.5 million tons of grain a
month if President  Viktor Yanukovych  signs a bill canceling corn
and wheat export taxes, Volodymyr Lapa, an analyst at the club,
told reporters in Kiev today. Legislators passed the measure
Oct. 7. The marketing year started July 1.  The country is set to pass  Brazil  as the world’s third-
biggest corn exporter, U.S. Department of Agriculture figures
show. Grain shipments in the marketing year may come to 23.4
million tons, according to a bill published Oct. 7 on the
parliamentary website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
