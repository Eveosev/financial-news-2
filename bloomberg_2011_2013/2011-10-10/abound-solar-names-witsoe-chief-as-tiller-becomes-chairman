Abound Solar Inc., which received in
December a $400 million loan guarantee to build two panel
factories, named Craig Witsoe president and chief executive
officer, replacing Tom Tiller, who will become chairman.  The changes take effect Nov. 1, the Loveland, Colorado-
based thin-film solar company said today in a statement. Tiller,
50, said he is relinquishing the CEO duties to attend to
personal issues.  “We have had some unexpected issues in our family, so I
need to transition to a role with less day-to-day involvement,”
Tiller said in the statement.  Witsoe was president and CEO of Lineage Power Holdings
Inc., a maker of electricity converters that was sold to  General
Electric Co. (GE)  in January. He’ll be tasked with helping Abound
complete factories in Colorado and  Indiana  that will make solar
panels using a cadmium-telluride semiconductor.  The U.S. Energy Department’s loan guarantee program has
come under political fire after Solyndra LLC filed for
bankruptcy Sept. 6. The Fremont, California-based solar company
received the first guarantee, worth $535 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
