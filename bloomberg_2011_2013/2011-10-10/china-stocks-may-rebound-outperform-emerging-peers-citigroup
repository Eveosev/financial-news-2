Chinese stocks may be near the
“bottom” and may outperform their emerging-market peers at
current levels, according to Citigroup Inc.  Both valuation and so-called upside/downside ratio, a
measure of market momentum, suggest that Chinese equities are
near their lows, Citigroup analysts Minggao Shen and Ben Wei
wrote in a report today. The market should rebound as concerns
over a global recession, a European Union default and a so-
called hard landing in  China  prove to be “over-done,” the
analysts said.  Investors should be “overweight” financial companies and
cyclical industries amid the rebound, the analysts said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
