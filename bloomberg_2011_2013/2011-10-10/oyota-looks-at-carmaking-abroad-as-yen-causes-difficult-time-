Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , Asia’s biggest
carmaker, may expand production outside Japan as the yen’s gains
on  currency markets  reduce earnings.  “We are struggling,” Chief Financial Officer Satoshi Ozawa said today in an interview at the automaker’s factory in
Ovar, Portugal. “We are facing a difficult time. We have to
reduce our production costs to compensate for the currency
situation,” and that may involve shifting manufacturing from
the home market of Japan “to some extent.”  The euro’s decline since April to a decade low against the
yen this month is reducing export earnings at the Toyota City,
Japan-based carmaker and competitors.  Carlos Ghosn , chief
executive officer of Nissan Motor Co., said on Oct. 6 that  Japan 
may endure a “hollowing out” of its industrial base should the
government fail to take steps to counter its currency’s gains.  Toyota’s production locations abroad as of the end of March
included 50 sites in 26 countries and regions, according to the
company’s  website . The company said on Oct. 6 that it’s hiring
more than 100 people at its European regional headquarters in
Brussels for research and development, sales and administration.  Ozawa was at the plant in Ovar for its 40th anniversary and
to see its 100,000th Dyna truck roll off the assembly line
today. The factory also makes the Hiace van.  To contact the reporter on this story:
