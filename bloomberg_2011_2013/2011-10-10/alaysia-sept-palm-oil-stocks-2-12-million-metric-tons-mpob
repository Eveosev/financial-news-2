Palm oil  stockpiles in Malaysia, the
second-largest producer, climbed more-than-expected to the
highest level since December 2009, boosted by increased
production and lower exports.  Inventory of the edible oil, used mostly in cooking, rose
12.4 percent to 2.12 million metric tons in September from a
month earlier, the  Malaysian Palm Oil Board  said in a statement
today. The median estimate was 2 million tons in a Bloomberg
News survey of three analysts and two plantation companies.  Higher supplies may extend a decline in prices, down 30
percent from a 35-month high of 3,967 ringgit ($1,266) a ton on
Feb. 10, and cut profits at producers including  Sime Darby Bhd. (SIME) 
and PT Astra Agro Lestari. Output climbed 12.1 percent to 1.87
million tons and exports fell 8.8 percent to 1.54 million tons.  “The higher inventories will be negative for CPO prices in
the near term until they can sell off these stockpiles,” Ivy Ng,
an analyst at CIMB Group Holdings Bhd., said by phone from Kuala
Lumpur, referring to crude palm oil by its initials.  Stockpiles were 1.71 million tons a year earlier and
exceeded 2 million tons last time in June, according to data
from the Board.  Palm oil for December delivery gained as much as 1.7
percent to 2,818 ringgit a ton and was at 2,777 ringgit in  Kuala
Lumpur . Futures have declined 27 percent this year.  Output Climbs  The production in September exceeded the median estimate of
1.77 million tons in the Bloomberg survey and was at the highest
level since October 2009. The output in Indonesia and Malaysia,
the biggest growers, typically peaks between July and October.  “Production may drop in October, but stockpiles may rise
due to weaker demand,” said Ker Chung Yang, an analyst at
Phillip Futures Pte.  Stockpiles will continue to stay above 2 million tons and
“may peak this month or next month,” Ng said. “The only good
thing is the festival of Diwali in  India . There will be demand
until mid of this month.”  Malaysia ’s palm oil exports climbed 31.8 percent to 496,918
tons in the first 10 days of October from the same period in
September, independent market surveyor Intertek said today.  India, the largest importer, has stepped up purchases ahead
of Diwali, which will be celebrated on Oct. 26.  To contact the reporters on this story:
