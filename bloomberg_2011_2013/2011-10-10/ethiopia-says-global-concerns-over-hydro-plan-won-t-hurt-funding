Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi said he doesn’t expect international concerns over the
country’s hydroelectric program to hurt financing plans.  “Because we are funding most of our projects from our own
resources, it should not affect it,” Zenawi said today in an
interview in Oslo.  Ethiopia  said last month it planned to offer more bonds
to finance the 5,250-megawatt Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam
after selling 7 billion birr ($408 million) of debt domestically
in the past six months. Ethiopia, source of the main tributary
of the Nile River, started building the hydro plant in April as
it seeks to become a regional power exporter.  Balancing increased investment spending and high inflation
“continues to be a challenge,” Zenawi said today. “Most of
the inflationary pressure in Ethiopia is coming from imported
inflation as global prices have gone up.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
