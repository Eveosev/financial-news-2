Portugal is carrying out an
adjustment to “stop” the country’s indebtedness as it seeks to
ensure a return to economic growth in the next few years without
the weight of high debt, Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho 
said.  Portugal aims to meet the targets that were agreed with the
European Union and the  International Monetary Fund  as part of
the financial aid program, Passos Coelho said today at an event
in Ovar, northern Portugal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
