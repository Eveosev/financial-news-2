John Vickers , chairman of the U.K.’s
 Independent Commission on Banking , said the downgrade of British
banks by Moody’s Investors Service was an “entirely benign”
development.  “In so far as that is a reflection of the step in progress
of getting the taxpayer off the hook, I would see that as an
entirely benign development,” Vickers told members of the House
of Commons  Treasury Committee  in  London  today. “I would see it
as a natural reflection of the taxpayer getting one step further
off the hook.”  Moody’s last week cut the senior debt and deposit ratings
of 12 British lenders including  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) 
and  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , saying the government would be
less likely to provide support in the event of failure. The
government-sponsored ICB’s report published last month is
“credit-negative for bondholders longer-term as they indicate
that new structures, such as ring-fencing, could be introduced
to aid resolution and allow senior bondholders to share the
burden of bank failure,” the service said.  The  Bank of England , the Financial Services Authority and
the Treasury have provided guidance that banks that fail in the
future shouldn’t expect a taxpayer-funded bailout, Moody’s said.  Lloyds TSB Bank Plc, Santander UK Plc and Co-Operative Bank
Plc had their ratings lowered one step by Moody’s, while RBS and
 Nationwide Building Society  were cut two levels. Seven smaller
building societies were cut from one to five levels, the rating
company said in a statement today. Clydesdale Bank was confirmed
at A2, with a negative outlook.  To contact the reporters on this story:
