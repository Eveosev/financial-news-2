Russia’s oilseed harvest will come
to a record 12 million metric tons this year, including 9
million tons of sunflower seeds, researcher SovEcon  said .  The crop will beat the all-time high of about 9 million
tons set in 2008, Moscow-based SovEcon said on its website
today. The harvest will exceed last year’s by 1.6 times, it
said.  The sunflower-seed crop will exceed national refining
capacity this year, which may reduce seed prices, particularly
in the Volga area, according to the researcher.  To contact the reporter on this story:
