Poland’s WIG20 Index jumped 75.24,
or 3.4 percent, to 2,265.59 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Warsaw,
climbing the most in almost two weeks.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
Warsaw Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Echo Investment SA (ECH)   rose for a second day, adding
0.19 zloty, or 5.4 percent, to 3.7 zloty as the real estate
developer controlled by billionaire Michal Solowow was upgraded
to “buy” from “hold” at UniCredit SpA.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, increased 6.5 zloty, or 4.8
percent, to 143 zloty, its fourth day of gains. Copper rose to
the highest in almost two weeks after the leaders of France and
 Germany  pledged a plan to stem  Europe ’s debt crisis in three
weeks.  Orco Property Group (OPG)  SA soared 1.1 zloty, or 6.9
percent, to 17 zloty, the biggest one-day gain since Aug. 19 in

the first time in three days.  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)  , the
second-largest refiner, climbed 1.2 zloty, or 5.2 percent, to
24.5 zloty. Oil climbed for a fourth day in  New York  as
investors bet that fuel demand may increase after a pledge by
European leaders to contain the region’s sovereign-debt crisis.  Warsaw Stock Exchange (GPW)   increased 0.95 zloty, or 2.2
percent, to 44.15 zloty, trimming this year’s decline to 9.9
percent as the operator of central Europe’s biggest equity
