Oil options volatility fell as the
underlying futures reached the highest level in two weeks after
German and French leaders pledged to halt the sovereign-debt
crisis in  Europe .  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
November, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 42.2 percent at noon in New York,
down from 43.1 percent Oct. 7.  Oil for November delivery gained $2.65, or 3.2 percent, to
$85.63 a barrel at 12:11 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile

November $80.50 puts, the next-most-active contract, sank 96
cents to 50 cents on volume of 2,078. One contract covers 1,000
barrels of crude.  The volume of puts outnumbered calls by about 57 percent to
43 percent.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
