The city of  Rio de Janeiro  plans to
sell bonds as early as next year to finance projects for the
2016 Olympic Games, Mayor Eduardo Paes said.  The city will wait to receive the second tranche of a $1.05
billion loan from the  World Bank  before offering the securities,
Paes told reporters in Rio today, declining to specify the
amount or currency of the sale. Rio needs approval from the
federal government to sell bonds because debt renegotiation in
the 1990s limited spending and debt levels of states and
municipalities.  Rio, which will host the Olympics two years after Brazil
hosts the soccer  World Cup , pledged investments of 23 billion
reais ($13 billion) for the sports event. The former seaside
capital of  Brazil , with a population of about 12 million people,
centered its bid on the use of sports as a catalyst for social
integration.  “Rio has the financial health to sell debt in global
markets and we are interested in issuing bonds,” Paes said.  The World Cup and Olympics will require 140 billion reais
of investments on stadiums, roads, airports and other projects,
Sports Minister Orlando Silva said in April.  Moody’s Investors Service in November upgraded the city’s
rating to Baa3 with a positive outlook from Ba2 “reflecting a
strong track record of financial performance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
