Joerg Asmussen, nominee to the
Executive Board of the  European Central Bank , said any leveraged
form of  Europe ’s bailout fund shouldn’t be able to tap the ECB’s
refinancing operations.  That “would be against both the letter and the spirit of
treaty article 123,” Asmussen said during a hearing on his
candidacy in the European Parliament today. He was referring to
the legal prohibition on the ECB directly financing governments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
