Thailand ’s baht advanced for a third
day after overseas investors added to holdings of the nation’s
assets last week.  Government bonds  fell.  The baht extended its first weekly gain in a month after
global funds purchased $243 million more local equities and $120
million more government bonds than they sold last week, data
from the stock exchange and the Thai Bond Market Association
show. Concern the nation’s worst floods in more than half a
century will crimp export growth may check the currency’s
appreciation, according to Disawat Tiaowvanich, a foreign-
exchange trader at Bangkok Bank Pcl.  “In the short run,  market sentiment  is improving due to
European developments,” said Bangkok-based Disawat. “The
floods are going to hurt the Thai economy since industrial hubs
have been affected and some factories need to be closed for a
while.”  The baht strengthened 0.1 percent to 30.92 per dollar as of
8:15 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It reached 30.85 on Oct. 7, the strongest level since Sept. 28.
The currency may trade between 30.80 and 31.30 this week,
Disawat said.  Flood waters broke through defenses around the Rojana
Industrial Park that is located north of Bangkok, a base for
companies that make automotive and electronics parts. Honda
Motor Co.,  Japan ’s third-largest automaker, and the world’s two
biggest makers of high-end cameras, Canon Inc. and Nikon Corp.,
are among companies that have suspended production at the
factories.  Losses may reach 130 billion baht ($4.2 billion) and cut
economic growth by as much as 1.3 percentage points this year,
the University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce said on Oct. 6.  The yield on the 5.25 percent bonds due May 2014 rose one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.52 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price dropped to
104.214 from 104.235 at the end of last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
