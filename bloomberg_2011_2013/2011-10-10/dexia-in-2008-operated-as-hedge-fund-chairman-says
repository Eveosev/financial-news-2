Dexia SA (DEXB)  Chairman Jean-Luc Dehaene
said the bank, bailed out in 2008, functioned as a hedge fund at
the time of its first rescue.  Following a 2008 analysis of the company’s operations,
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Mariani told the chairman that
“this isn’t a bank, it is a hedge fund,” Dehaene said today on
a conference call from Brussels.  Both Dehaene and Mariani took their current positions after
Dexia got a bailout from France and  Belgium  in 2008.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
