European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said the bank won’t directly fund
the European rescue fund.  “Given the situation as it is now there has been a clear
understanding that no direct ECB funds will be used,” Nowotny
told reporters in Vienna today. He said he doesn’t see the need
to renegotiate the decisions taken on July 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
