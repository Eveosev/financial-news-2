Scotts Miracle-Gro Co. (SMG) , the maker of
Scotts lawn products, said full-year preliminary earnings were
less than expected after Hurricane Irene reduced demand.  Adjusted net income was $2.70 to $2.75 a share for the year
ended Sept. 30 and sales declined 2 percent from last year, the
Marysville, Ohio-based company said in a statement today. Scotts
forecast earnings of $2.95 to $3.05 a share in August. The
company was expected to report $2.95, the average of 10
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “The weather issues that plagued us throughout fiscal 2011
remained problematic during the fourth quarter,” Jim Hagedorn,
the company’s chairman and chief executive officer, said in the
statement. “The impact of  Hurricane Irene  and other inclement
weather in September all but eliminated lawn and garden activity
in key markets.”  Scotts dropped 3.9 percent to close at $45.14 in  New York .
The company is scheduled to report earnings before the market
opens on Nov. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
