Mexico has no plans to revise its
2011 economic growth forecast of 4 percent,  Miguel Messmacher ,
the  Finance Ministry ’s chief economist, said today in Mexico
City.  ``If you had asked me two weeks ago, I would have said 
that maybe there was more of a downside risk, but in the last 
two weeks the data in the U.S. has done better than expected,''
Messmacher said. ``I would expect that we won't move it,'' he 
added, referring to the government's forecast for economic
growth of 4 percent this year.  Messmacher, speaking at an event in Mexico City, also said
that Mexico’s economy may see a significant expansion in the
newt few years and that there are no plans to revise the current
economic growth forecast for this year of 4 percent.  Speaking afterward, Messmacher said that recent U.S.
economic reports have helped to reverse the downward risk of
 Mexico ’s economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
