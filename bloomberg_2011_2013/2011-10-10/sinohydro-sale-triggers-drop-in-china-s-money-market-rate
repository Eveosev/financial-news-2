China ’s benchmark money-market rate
dropped the most in more than a month as demand for funds fell
after Sinohydro Group Ltd. completed the nation’s biggest
initial public offering so far this year.  The country’s largest builder of hydroelectric dams raised
13.5 billion yuan ($2.1 billion) from its equity offering,
according to a company statement on Sept. 29. China’s financial
markets were shut last week for the National Day holidays.  “The seven-day repurchase rate is expected to come down in
the coming days as it was held high by IPO subscriptions two
weeks ago,” said  Matthew Huang , a senior strategist at
Macquarie Group Ltd. in  Singapore .  The seven-day repo rate, a gauge of funding availability in
the financial system, decreased 37 basis points, or 0.37
percentage point, to 4.439 percent as of 4:27 p.m. in Shanghai,
according to a weighted average compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center. That was the biggest decline since
Sept. 6 and the lowest level since Sept. 26.  The one-year swap rate, the fixed cost paid to receive the
floating seven-day repurchase rate, fell four basis points to
3.6825 percent in Shanghai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The measure slid 72 basis points last month, the most
since November 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
