European Central Bank  governing
council member Marko Kranjec said banks in  France  and  Germany 
would suffer if  Greece  defaulted on its debt, and this would
cause a “domino effect.”  Kranjec, who is also governor of  Slovenia ’s central bank,
said in an interview today on TV Slovenija that he expects
Greece will restructure its debt and won’t default.  To contact the reporter on this story:
