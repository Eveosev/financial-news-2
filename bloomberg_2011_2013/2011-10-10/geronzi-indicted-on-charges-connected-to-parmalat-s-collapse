Former Capitalia SpA Chairman Cesare Geronzi must stand trial on charges of fraudulent bankruptcy and
extortion in connection with  Parmalat SpA (PLT) ’s collapse.  Ennio Amodio, Geronzi’s lawyer, said the indictment
violates the banker’s rights because he faced similar charges in
the bankruptcy case of foodmaker Cirio Finanziaria SpA. Amodio,
speaking in a telephone interview, said his client hadn’t
committed any wrongdoing.  Prosecutors are investigating the role played by Geronzi in
Parmalat’s purchase of dairy company Eurolat from Cirio. In July
a judge sentenced him to a four-year jail term for his role in
the bankruptcy of Cirio. Geronzi appealed the sentence.  The Rome judge’s decision to indict Geronzi was earlier
reported by newswire Ansa and confirmed by Amodio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
