A tax agreement that would impose
new levies on German offshore assets in Switzerland is
“effectively dead,”  SonntagsZeitung  reported, citing an
interview with Jens Bullerjahn, finance minister of Sachsen-
Anhalt.  The German state would buy data on Swiss banks’ clients
regardless of whether the accord were ratified, Bullerjahn, who
is a member of the  Social Democratic Party , was also cited as
saying in the Zurich-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
