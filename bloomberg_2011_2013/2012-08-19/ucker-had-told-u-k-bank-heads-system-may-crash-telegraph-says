Bank of England Deputy Governor  Paul
Tucker  told U.K. bank executives last year that the banking
system could collapse by that Christmas, the Sunday Telegraph
said, citing people familiar with the situation.  Tucker made the comments at an October meeting with the
chief executives of Britain’s largest banks, the newspaper said,
citing three people present at the meeting that it didn’t
identify.  Officials at the central bank were concerned a collapse of
the euro area would spark a financial crisis even greater than
the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008, the
newspaper said.  A Bank of England spokeswoman declined to comment.  -- Editor:  Keith Campbell   To contact the reporter on this story:
