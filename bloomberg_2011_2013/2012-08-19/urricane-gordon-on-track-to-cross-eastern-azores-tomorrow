Hurricane Gordon, the seventh named
storm of the Atlantic season, remains on track to cross the
eastern Azores tomorrow, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said
in its latest  advisory .  The hurricane is about 160 miles (255 kilometers) southwest
of the Azores’ Sao Miguel Island and is traveling east-northeast
at 21 miles (33 kilometers) per hour, the Miami-based center
said in its 5 p.m. Eastern time advisory. It’s a Category 1 on
the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale.  The storm has maximum sustained winds of 85 mph, down from
90 mph at 2 p.m.  Gordon will experience “some additional weakening” the
next two days, the agency said. Hurricane-force winds extend 35
miles outward from Gordon’s center, the advisory said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
