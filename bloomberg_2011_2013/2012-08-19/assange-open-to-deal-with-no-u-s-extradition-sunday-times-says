Julian Assange is willing to face
charges in  Sweden  providing he received guarantees he won’t be
extradited to the U.S., the Sunday Times said, citing the
WikiLeaks founder’s colleague Kristinn Hrafnsson.  Such an agreement with assurances from the Swedish and U.K.
authorities would be a basis for negotiations, Hrafnsson said,
according to the newspaper. Assange is due to make a public
statement outside the Ecuadorean embassy in London, where he has
sought asylum, the Sunday Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
