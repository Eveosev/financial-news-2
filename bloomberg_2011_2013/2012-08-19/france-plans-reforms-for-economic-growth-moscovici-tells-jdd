President  Francois Hollande ’s
government is preparing to introduce changes to French economic
policy to spur growth, Finance Minister  Pierre Moscovici  told  Le
Journal du Dimanche  in an interview.  “The competitiveness of our economy is one of the subjects
I’m focusing on,” Moscovici was quoted as saying by the
newspaper. “We want policies that favor enterprise and
investment, notably through the public investment bank.
Structural reforms particular to France will boost growth,” he
said.  The remarks underline the pressure Hollande’s government
faces to generate growth after the  French economy  failed to
expand for three straight quarters. Hollande will reassess the
government’s 2013 growth target of 1.2 percent in coming weeks,
Le Journal du Dimanche said.  “Once we manage to revive momentum in  Europe  and in
France, we have a real potential for growth in 2013,” Moscovici
said.  Moscovici also said the government won’t ease its deficit
targets because that would risk increasing borrowing costs.
“ France  is borrowing at very low rates, sometimes even negative
rates,” Moscovici said. “Any sign of flinching will be
sanctioned, which will increase borrowing costs.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
