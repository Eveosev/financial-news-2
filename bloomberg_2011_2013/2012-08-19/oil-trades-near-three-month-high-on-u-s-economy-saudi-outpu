Oil climbed for a fifth day in  New
York , the longest streak of gains in a month, on signs of a
strengthening U.S. economy and speculation that higher Saudi
Arabian crude output indicates increasing demand for fuel.  Futures gained as much as 0.5 percent after closing at a
three-month high on Aug. 17 as a report showed U.S.  consumer
confidence  unexpectedly improved. Home sales and orders for
durable goods probably climbed in July, economists said before
figures this week.  Saudi Arabia  pumped crude at the highest
level in more than three decades in June and monthly exports
were the most since November 2005, according to the Joint
Organization Data Initiative.  “Oil has been aided by the pickup in consumer confidence
in the U.S.,” said Ric Spooner, a chief market analyst at CMC
Markets in Sydney. The increase in Saudi production shows “the
supply capacity is there to meet increased demand,” he said.  Crude for September delivery advanced as much as 52 cents
to $96.53 a barrel and was at $96.29 in electronic trading on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 4:55 p.m. Sydney time. It
rose 0.4 percent to $96.01 on Aug. 17, the highest close since
May 11. The contract expires tomorrow. The more-actively traded
October future was at $96.57. Oil’s run of gains is the longest
since the seven days ended July 19. Front-month prices are 2.6
percent lower this year.  Brent oil for September settlement climbed 42 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $114.13 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European benchmark grade’s premium to West
Texas Intermediate was at $17.84, from $17.39 on Aug. 17.  Saudi Production  Saudi Arabia’s output increased 3 percent to 10.1 million
barrels a day in June from May, according to data submitted by
the government to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries and posted on JODI’s website yesterday. Exports were
at 7.84 million barrels a day. The Middle East nation overtook
 Russia , which pumped 9.9 million barrels a day, as the world’s
largest oil producer during the month, the data showed.  Combined purchases of new and existing homes in the U.S.
increased to a 4.89 million annual rate from a 4.72 million pace
in June, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.
The National Association of Realtors will release existing sales
on Aug. 22, with the Commerce Department publishing data on new
sales the next day.  Durable goods orders probably rose 3 percent in July, the
most since December, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey before a Commerce Department report on Aug. 24.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
August index of consumer sentiment rose to 73.6, the highest
level since May, from 72.3 the prior month. The gauge was
projected to be little changed at 72.2, according to the median
forecast of 72 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Net-long positions in oil held by money managers, including
 hedge funds , commodity pools and commodity trading advisers,
retreated by 11,764, or 7.2 percent, to 152,222 futures and
options combined in the seven days ended Aug. 14, according to
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s Commitments of
Traders report on Aug. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
