Oil rose, extending last week’s
biggest gain in a month, and U.S. equity futures climbed as
 Europe ’s leaders planned talks to help defuse the continent’s
debt crisis. The euro was little changed.  Crude in New York rose 0.3 percent to $96.33 a barrel as of
7:14 a.m. in Tokyo. Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
added 0.1 percent to 1,417.10 after capping six weeks of gains
last week, the longest stretch since January 2011. The euro
traded at $1.2338.  With the single currency’s continuing crisis threatening
the global economy, Jean-Claude Juncker, the Luxembourg premier
who heads the group of euro-area finance ministers, is expected
in Athens on Aug. 22 to discuss Greek Prime Minister Antonis
Samaras’ request for a two-year extension for the country’s
fiscal adjustment program. Samaras travels to Berlin and Paris
on Aug. 24 and 25 after French President  Francois Hollande   and
German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  meet in the German capital on
Aug. 23.  Home sales and orders for durable goods probably climbed in
July, signaling the U.S. is starting to strengthen after a
second-quarter slowdown, economists said before reports this
week. Combined purchases of new and existing houses increased to
a 4.89 million annual rate from a 4.72 million pace in June,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey. Bookings
for long-lasting goods climbed the most this year, another
report may show.  The  S&P 500  rose 0.9 percent to 1,418.16 last week,
bringing its gain for the year to 13 percent. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  added 67.25 points, or 0.5 percent, to
13,275.20 for the week. On the last day of trading, it touched
the highest level since December 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
