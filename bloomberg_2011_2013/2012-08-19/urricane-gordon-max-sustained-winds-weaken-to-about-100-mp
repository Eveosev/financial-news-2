Hurricane Gordon, the seventh named
storm of the Atlantic season, weakened as it continues to move
east toward the Azores, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said
in its latest advisory.  The storm, which has maximum sustained winds of 100 miles
(160 kilometers) per hour, weakened from 105 mph about three
hours ago, the Miami-based center said. Gordon is still expected
to be a hurricane when it passes near or over the eastern Azores
early tomorrow, the agency said.  The hurricane is about 340 miles to the west-southwest of
the Azores’ Sao Miguel Island, the center said. It’s moving east
at 23 mph. The storm is a Category 2 on the Saffir-Simpson
scale.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
