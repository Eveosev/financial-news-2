Brazil  will take back some railroad
concessions to auction them under the country’s infrastructure
plan to build 10,000 kilometers (6,215 miles) of railways,  Folha
de S.Paulo  said, citing Transport Minister Paulo Sergio Passos.  The companies have already agreed with the government to
return the concessions, Folha said, citing the minister. Brazil
will take steps to ensure the companies don’t incur any losses
in returning the railways, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
