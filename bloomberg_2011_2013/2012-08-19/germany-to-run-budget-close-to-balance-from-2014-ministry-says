Germany  will run a national budget
that’s close to balance starting in 2014, complying with
European Union rules spelled out in the fiscal pact for
budgetary discipline, according to the  Finance Ministry .  Tax revenue rose 8.6 percent in July from a year earlier,
led by Germany’s 16 states, while revenue in the first seven
months of the year increased 5 percent, the Berlin-based
ministry said in its monthly report.  Even so, economic indicators suggest that the expansion of
 Europe ’s biggest economy is likely to slow in the course of this
year, the ministry said, citing business sentiment surveys.
German companies are suffering from declining demand in the
other 16 countries that use the euro, it said.  “The debt crisis is increasingly weighing on economic
growth in the euro region, with the corresponding consequences
for Germany’s foreign trade,” the ministry said.  The euro-area economy contracted 0.2 percent in the second
quarter as austerity measures pushed at least six  member states 
including Italy and Spain into recession. Exports still rose for
a second month in June, driven by a surge in shipments from
Germany.  To contact the reporter on this story:
