President  Francois Hollande  and
 Chancellor Angela Merkel  need the latest report on Greece’s
economic situation and a precise aid request before deciding how
to help the country, France’s European affairs minister said.  “There’s a process we’re engaged in to evaluate the
efforts made by Greece in recent months, which we know was set
back by elections,” European Affairs Minister Bernard Cazeneuve
said today on Europe 1 radio. “We’ll evaluate the situation and
try to take a common position.”  The remarks come as Hollande and Merkel prepare to meet in
Berlin on Aug. 23 and Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras
travels to Berlin and Paris on Aug. 24 and 25 to discuss the
state of his nation’s economy and deficit reduction effort.  The so-called troika of the  European Central Bank , the
European Commission and the  International Monetary Fund  are
preparing a report to assess Greece’s progress.  “It’s important to let the Greeks express their request
clearly, to let the Troika report and then to hold discussions
between European countries to find the right position,”
Cazeneuve said. “We want countries to meet their commitments
and we want the European Union to create conditions that will
generate growth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
