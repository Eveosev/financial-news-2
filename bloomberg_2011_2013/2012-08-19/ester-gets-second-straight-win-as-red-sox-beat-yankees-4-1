Jon Lester  got his second straight
win as the Boston Red Sox defeated the American League-leading
New York Yankees 4-1 and even their three-game weekend series.  Lester (7-10) allowed five hits and struck out four in
seven innings yesterday at Yankee Stadium. Alfredo Aceves gave
up one hit and struck out one in the ninth for his 25th save.  “It’s always gratifying to see the fruits of your labor,
for lack of a better term,” Lester told reporters. “It’s been
a grinding season.” Yesterday’s performance cut the left-
hander’s earned run average this season to 5.03, compared to his
career 3.74 mark.  David Phelps (3-4) gave up three runs on seven hits and
struck out seven in 6 2/3 innings in taking the loss.  Adrian Gonzalez  hit a two-run homer in the first inning to
give the Red Sox a 2-0 advantage. Nick Punto added a run-scoring
double in the fifth and Scott Podsednik reached home plate on
Cody Eppley’s wild pitch in the ninth.  “We still have it,” said Red Sox manager  Bobby Valentine .
“We’ve had it. We’ve got it. We just haven’t used it as often
and saved it up.”  The Red Sox (59-62) are in fourth place in the five-team AL
East, 12 ½ games behind the Yankees (71-49).  Curtis Granderson  hit his 32nd home run of the season in
the fourth inning for the Yankees’ only score. The previous
night the Yankees slammed five home runs against the  Red Sox  to
take the first of the three games 6-4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
