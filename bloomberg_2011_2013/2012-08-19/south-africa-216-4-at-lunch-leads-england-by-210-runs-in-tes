South Africa reached 216-4 at lunch
on the fourth day of the final cricket Test against England at
Lord’s, a lead of 210 runs.  Hashim Amla is 94 not out, with AB de Villiers on 24.  Dale
Steyn  was the only batsman dismissed this morning, the
nightwatchman scoring 9 runs.  England must win to remain No. 1 in the  International
Cricket Council ’s Test rankings, while a draw is enough for
South Africa to leapfrog the hosts. The Proteas won the first
Test by an innings and 12 runs with the second rain-affected
game drawn.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
