Nigel Rudd, a former deputy chairman
of  Barclays Plc (BARC) , said a U.K. parliamentary report’s criticism of
 Robert Diamond  was “completely unacceptable,” the Sunday Times
newspaper  reported .  Rudd said the House of Commons Treasury Committee hadn’t
provided sufficient evidence to support its suggestion that
Diamond misled parliament over his testimony to lawmakers, Rudd
said, according to the newspaper. Diamond genuinely didn’t know
the answers to questions that were put to him, Rudd said, the
Sunday Times reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
