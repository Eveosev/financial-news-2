Sunderland made an approach
yesterday to sign Manchester United striker Dimitar Berbatov and
has bid 10 million pounds ($15.7 million) for Manchester Cityâ€™s
 Adam Johnson , the People reported.  United wants 5 million pounds for Berbatov, 31, who will be
allowed to leave after the club signed  Robin van Persie  from its
Premier League soccer rival Arsenal, the newspaper said, without
citing anyone.   Sunderland faces competition from Tottenham and Everton for
England winger Johnson, 25, who is frustrated at his lack of
playing time at City, the People said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
