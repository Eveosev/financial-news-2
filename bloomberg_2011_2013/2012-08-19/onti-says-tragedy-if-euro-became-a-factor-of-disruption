Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
said it would be a tragedy if European leaders are unable to
ease tension and bring stability to common currency area.  “The euro is the pinnacle of the European construction,”
he said in a speech today in Rimini,  Italy . “It would be a
tragedy if it became, because of the inability of us, heads of
governments, a factor of disruption which revives biases of the
north against south or the other way around.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
