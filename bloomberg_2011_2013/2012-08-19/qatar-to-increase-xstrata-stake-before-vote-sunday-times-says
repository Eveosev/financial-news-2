Qatar Holding LLC will continue to
raise its stake in Xstrata Plc as it seeks a higher offer for
the mining company from  Glencore International Plc (GLEN) , the Sunday
Times  reported , without saying where it got the information.  Qatar boosted its ownership of Xstrata to 11.7 percent as
of Aug. 17, the newspaper said. Qatar Holding may be able to
block Glencore’s offer for Xstrata in a Sept. 7 vote with a 12
percent stake, the Sunday Times said, citing bankers it didn’t
identify.  To contact the reporter on this story:
