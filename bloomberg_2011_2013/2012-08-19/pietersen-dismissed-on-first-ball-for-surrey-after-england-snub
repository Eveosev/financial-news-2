Kevin Pietersen  was dismissed on his
first ball in a match for Surrey today after he was left out of
the England cricket squad against South Africa in a row over
text messages.  Pietersen, facing his former county Hampshire in his first
match since being dropped by England, was bowled by slow left-
armer Liam Dawson in the Clydesdale Bank 40 game at Southampton.
His dismissal, in the fifth over, left Surrey at 14-2 and
prompted cheers from the crowd. Surrey totaled 175-9 in its 40
overs, and Hampshire ended on 176-6 to win by four wickets in
38.1 overs.  Pietersen last week apologized to the England and Wales
Cricket Board for “provocative”  text messages  he sent to South
Africa players. His actions had led to his exclusion from the
England squad for the third Test currently taking place.  The Daily Mail reported that the texts contained “less
than flattering” comments about England captain  Andrew Strauss 
and his teammates.  Pietersen has also been in a wrangle about his playing
commitments. He’d wanted to give up 50-over games for England
and play just Tests and Twenty20s but national contracts don’t
allow that.  In May he said he’d therefore focus on Tests, then a week
ago he said he’d be prepared to play all forms of the game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
