New York  Yankees’ CC Sabathia, who
threw about 20 pitches with no pain in his left elbow, said he’s
ready to return to the rotation in the team’s game against the
 Cleveland Indians  on Aug. 24.  The game against the Indians is on the day he becomes
eligible to be activated from the 15-day disabled list.  “Pending any kind of setbacks or swelling or anything, I
should be ready to go,” said Sabathia, who is 12-3 this season.
“I haven’t had any of that the past couple of days, so I should
be good.”  The left-handed pitcher said he plans to follow yesterday’s
bullpen session with another on Aug. 21, when he’ll try to throw
40 pitches.  Sabathia, 32, was placed on the disabled list for the
second time this season after feeling stiffness in his elbow
following his Aug. 8 start against the  Detroit Tigers .  The Yankees lead the American League with a 71-49 record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
