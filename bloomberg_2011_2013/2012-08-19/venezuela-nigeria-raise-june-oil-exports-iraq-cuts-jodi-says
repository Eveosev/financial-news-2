Venezuela , the holder of the world’s
largest oil reserves, and Nigeria both increased shipments of
crude in June, while  Iraq  cut exports during the month,
according to the Joint Organization Data Initiative.  Venezuelan exports rose 10.6 percent from a month earlier
to 1.72 million barrels a day and Nigeria shipped 2.49 million
barrels a day, 18 percent more than May, according to statistics

Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, decreased

a group of nations accounting for more than 90 percent of global
oil and natural-gas supply and demand, was established as a
forum for producing and consuming countries to discuss  energy
security . The U.S., China and the European Union are among the
IEF’s members, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
