U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
failed to gain a significant boost in popularity among voters
from the Olympics, a Comres poll showed.  Cameron’s Conservative party gained one point to 33
percent, with support for Labour remaining unchanged at 42
percent, the poll, commissioned by the Independent on Sunday and
Sunday Mirror newspapers, showed. Support for the Liberal
Democrats was unchanged at 10 percent.  More than half of respondents, or 51 percent, said the
Olympics will probably boost the U.K. economy, the poll showed.
Comres interviewed 2,024 people online from Aug. 15 to 17.  -- Editor:  Keith Campbell   To contact the reporter on this story:
