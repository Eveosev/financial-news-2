Demand for workers increased at a
slower pace in  Scotland  in July compared with the previous month
and recruiters placed fewer people into permanent work,
according to a report by Bank of Scotland.  Average salaries paid to permanent employees fell for the
second consecutive month and by the most since September 2010,
the report said. The Bank of Scotland Labour Market Barometer
fell to 50.2 in July from 52.3 in June, it said.  “The number of people appointed to permanent jobs declined
for the first time this year showing the effect of the current
slowdown in the economy,” Donald MacRae, chief economist at
Bank of Scotland, said in the statement. “However, the number
of vacancies continued to increase, giving hope that the upwards
trend in employment can be maintained.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
