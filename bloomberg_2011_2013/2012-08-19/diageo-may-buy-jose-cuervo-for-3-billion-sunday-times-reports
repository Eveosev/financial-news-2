Diageo Plc (DGE)  is close to agreeing on a
deal to buy  Jose Cuervo  from Mexicoâ€™s Beckmann family for $3
billion, the Sunday Times  reported , without saying where it got
the information.  The deal may be announced as soon as Aug. 23 and will
probably be funded at least in part with shares, the newspaper
said. The sale may include separate agreements for the brand,
the production facilities, and the land where the agave plant
used in tequila is grown, it said.  Diageo spokeswoman Kirsty King declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
