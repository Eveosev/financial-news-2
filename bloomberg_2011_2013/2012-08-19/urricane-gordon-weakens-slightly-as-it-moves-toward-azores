Hurricane Gordon, the seventh named
storm of the Atlantic season, has weakened “a little” as it
moves toward the Azores, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said
in its latest advisory.  The storm now has maximum sustained winds of 90 miles (144
kilometers) per hour, down from 100 mph three hours earlier, the
Miami-based center said in the advisory.  The Category 1 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson
scale is moving east-northeast at 21 mph, and is about 220 miles
southwest of the Azores’ Sao Miguel Island, the center said.  The storm is expected to weaken further during the next 48
hours, but is still expected to be a hurricane when it passes
near or over the eastern Azores tomorrow, the center said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
