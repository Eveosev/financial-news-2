(Corrects source of vote tally in first paragraph.)  American Airlines flight attendants
voted to approve cost reductions sought by the bankrupt carrier,
their union said in an e-mail.  The vote was 7,482 to 5,088, the  Association of
Professional Flight Attendants  said. They accepted a contract
with an early retirement offer that may prevent 2,300 furloughs
by  AMR Corp. (AAMRQ) , the airlineâ€™s parent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
