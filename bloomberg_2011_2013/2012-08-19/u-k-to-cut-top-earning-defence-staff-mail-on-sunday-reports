U.K. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond is planning to cut the number of top-earning defense
staff by a quarter to reduce spending, the Mail on Sunday said,
without saying where it got the information.  The posts of Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet, Naval Home
Command, Land Forces and Air will disappear, the newspaper
reported.  The four current Commander-in-Chiefs are paid 150,000
pounds ($235,455) a year and their responsibilities will be
taken over by Chief of the General Staff Peter Wall when their
terms end, the Mail on Sunday said.  In total, 26 civilian and military posts in the senior
civil service will be axed from April next year, saving almost 4
million pounds a year, the newspaper said.  A Ministry of Defence spokesman declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
