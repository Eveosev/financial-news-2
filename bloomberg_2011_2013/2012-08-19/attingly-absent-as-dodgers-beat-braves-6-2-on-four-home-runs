Los Angeles Dodgers manager  Don Mattingly  was absent as his team defeated the Atlanta Braves 6-2
with four home runs, three in the first inning.  Mattingly yesterday began a two-game suspension handed down
by  Major League Baseball  for arguing with the umpire during a
game. He will also miss today’s contest.  The Dodgers’ manager also received an undisclosed fine for
“excessive arguing” with home plate umpire Angel Campos in the
team’s 10-6 loss at Pittsburgh two days ago. Mattingly was
ejected from that game.  Hanley Ramirez, James Loney and Luis Cruz hit consecutive
home runs over four pitches by Ben Sheets in the second inning.
Ramirez added a three-run homer in the sixth at Turner Field in
Atlanta.  Martin Prado hit a run-scoring double in the first and a
solo home run in the ninth for the Braves.  Aaron Harang (9-7) gave up one run on four hits and struck
out eight in 6 2/3 innings. Kenley Jansen recorded his 25th save,
allowing one run on one hit and striking out three in 1 1/3
innings.  Sheets (4-3) surrendered six runs on four hits and struck
out three in six innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
