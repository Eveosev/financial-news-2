Bentley Motors Ltd., the British
super-luxury brand owned by  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , presented a
convertible concept version of its flagship Mulsanne model to
vie with the Rolls Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe.  The model would cost more than the Mulsanne sedan, which is
sold for $286,000, if the carmaker goes ahead with production,
the Crewe, England-based company said in an e-mailed statement
today. The engine would be a 512-horsepower turbocharged V8
engine.  “The convertible concept will extend the appeal of the
Mulsanne family, while enhancing the profile of the Bentley
brand, particularly in new and  emerging markets .” said
Bentley’s Chief Executive Officer  Wolfgang Duerheimer  in the
statement.  Bentley is extending its product offering after returning
to profitability last year. It unveiled a sport-utility vehicle
concept at the  Geneva Motor Show  earlier this year and rolled
out the Continental GT Speed, the fastest Bentley ever, to tap
demand from the growing ranks of wealthy consumers in China and
the Middle East.  Bentley’s sales grew 32 percent to 3,929 cars in the first
half of 2012 as deliveries in the U.S. outpaced China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
