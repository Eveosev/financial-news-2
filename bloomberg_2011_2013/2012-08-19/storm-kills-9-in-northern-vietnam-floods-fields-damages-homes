At least nine people were killed and
at least 14 were injured by a storm that brought heavy rains to
northern  Vietnam  over the weekend, according to the country’s
central committee for flood and storm control.  Typhoon Kai-tak also passed through southern  China , causing
floods and the evacuation of more than 500,000 people.  Three people died in Vietnam’s Vinh Phuc province, west of
the capital city of Hanoi, where one person was killed as a
result of the storm, the committee said in  a report  posted on
its website. Other fatalities took place in Bac Giang, Lao Cai,
Son La and Yen Bai provinces, according to the report.  More than 20,000 hectares of rice fields were flooded in
the region, and some provincial roads were damaged, the
committee said. More than 11,000 houses were damaged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
