Texas Keystone, the company being
sued along with  Gulf Keystone Petroleum Ltd. (GKP)  for a stake in
Iraqi oil fields, said an ex-soldier was never part of an
exploration deal covering parts of Kurdistan that turned out to
hold as much as 15 billion barrels of crude.  Rex Wempen’s company Excalibur Ventures LLC “by its own
volition was not a party to the concession in question,” Texas
Keystone’s lawyer Michael Crane said during the third day of a
London trial. The Kurdish government said it didn’t want
Excalibur to be involved, he said.  Wempen claims Texas Keystone signed a 2006 agreement to
give him a 30 percent share of any oil concessions it won in the
area and that it was an agent of Gulf Keystone. The stake was
worth as much as $1.6 billion, he said in court documents.  Gulf Keystone and its affiliate deny the claim. Wempen
didn’t hold up his end of the deal because he didn’t contribute
to the exploration costs, they said.  The case is: Excalibur Ventures LLC v. Texas Keystone Inc.
& Ors, High Court of Justice, Queen’s  Bench Division , Commercial
Court, 10-1517.  To contact the reporter on this story:
