The Prague appeal court upheld a
2010 conviction, with a 10-year prison sentence, for  Viktor
Kozeny , a Czech-born businessman who is wanted for bribery by
the U.S.,  CTK  reported.  The court lowered the same sentence for Kozenyâ€™s business
partner Boris Vostry to nine years, CTK said.  Kozeny and Vostry were sentenced in absentia in 2010 for
causing 16 billion koruna ($845 million) in losses and damage to
Harvard Industrial Holding, the Czech mutual fund created in the
1990s to buy shares in state companies that were being sold to
the public, CTK added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
