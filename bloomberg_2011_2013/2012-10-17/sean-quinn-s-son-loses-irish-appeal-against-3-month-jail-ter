Sean Quinn Jr., the son of a former
billionaire that had been Ireland’s richest man, lost a Supreme
Court appeal against his three-month imprisonment following his
conviction in July for contempt of court.  High Court Judge Elizabeth Dunne sentenced him on July 20
to three months in jail after he failed to disclose assets in
line with a court order. The younger Quinn, his father and
cousin Peter Darragh Quinn continued to place assets beyond the
reach of nationalized Irish Bank Resolution Corp., formerly
Anglo Irish Bank Corp., after the court ordered them to stop
last year, Dunne said on June 26.  Lawyers for IBRC, which is owed about 2.8 billion euros
($3.7 billion) by the Quinn family, can apply for a new order to
extend Sean Quinn Jr.’s imprisonment when his three-month
sentence ends, according to the ruling, handed out to reporters
in Dublin today. His father is scheduled to appear in court
again on Oct. 19.  The elder Quinn said “it’s very likely” he’ll face
prison for contempt of court, according to an interview with the
bankrupt businessman, aired by RTE Radio on July 29. He said his
family lost 3.29 billion euros investing in Anglo Irish before
it was nationalized more than three years ago.  “I regret ever hearing the name of the bank,” he said in
the interview. “I’ve done everything in my power to purge my
contempt.”  Quinn’s fortune was valued at $6 billion by Forbes in 2008.
He was declared bankrupt in January after a court ruled he owed
IBRC 2.16 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
