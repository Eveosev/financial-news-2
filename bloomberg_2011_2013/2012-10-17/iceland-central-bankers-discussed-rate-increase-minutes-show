Members of the Iceland central
bank’s policy board discussed increasing the benchmark  interest
rate  by 25 basis points at an Oct. 2 meeting, according to
minutes published today.  The Monetary Policy Committee “discussed leaving the
bank’s rates unchanged or raising them by 0.25 percentage
point,” the minutes said. “The central bank governor proposed
that the bank’s interest rates be kept unchanged” at 5.75
percent.  Three out of five committee members “supported the central
bank governor’s proposal,” according to the minutes. The other
two argued for raising rates by 0.25 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
