BTA Bank (BTAS) , the Kazakh lender seeking
to restructure its debt for a second time, said it won a court
case to regain control over its Kyrgyz unit that was lost in a
“raiding scheme” three years ago.  A court in the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek on Oct. 12 voided
the results of an auction sale of a 71 percent stake in ZAO BTA
Bank and ordered its return to the Kazakh parent company, the
Almaty-based bank said in a statement e-mailed today.  Investment Holding Co., BTA’s bondholder based in
Kyrgyzstan, said in October 2009 it was seeking a court order to
sell BTA assets in the country at public auction to recover its
investment after rejecting BTA’s debt-restructuring offer. The
company at the time held 28.4 million pounds ($45.9 million) of
BTA’s 7.125 percent bonds due in December 2009.  BTA’s previous court appeals had no effect “because of the
pressure applied by organizers of the raiding scheme,” the
Kazakh bank said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
