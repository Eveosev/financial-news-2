Argentina ’s Deputy Economy Minister
Axel Kicillof said the government doesn’t plan to nationalize
other energy companies, newspaper Clarin reported.  Kicillof told Senators yesterday that the country’s goal to
be energy self-sufficient won’t be reached this year, according
to the Buenos Aires-based newspaper.  He spoke as Argentina’s biggest electricity companies
 Empresa Distribuidora y Comercializadora Norte SA  and Empresa
Distribuidora Sur SA face financial difficulties, Clarin said.
