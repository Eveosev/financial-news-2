Adam Sieminski , head of the U.S.
Energy Information Administration, said falling costs for wind
power will make the alternate energy competitive with natural
gas and coal, spurring expansion in the next two decades.  Sieminski, whose office is independent and doesnâ€™t set
policies, said extending a tax credit for wind power, set to
expire in December, would help increase use of the power. Even
if that tax provision expires as scheduled, wind generation will
grow, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
