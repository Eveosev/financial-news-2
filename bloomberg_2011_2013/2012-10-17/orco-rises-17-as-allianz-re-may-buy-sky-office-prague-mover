Orco Property Group (ORC)  SA headed for
the highest level in about five months on press reports that the
developer is in advanced negotiations with  Allianz Real Estate (ALRSEAT) 
about a sale of its Sky Office building in Dusseldorf.  Orco rose 10.59 koruna, or 17 percent, to 73 koruna by 1:49
p.m. in Prague trading, extending its rally this month to 83
percent. This is the highest value of the shares since May 30,
based on closing prices. The stock turnover so far today has
been at almost five times the daily average over the past three
months.  Orco seeks 140 million euros ($184 million) for the
building, while real-estate appraisers have valued the asset at
120 million euros, Immobilien Zeitung reported earlier this week
citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.  Orcoâ€™s Chief Executive Officer Jean-Fracois Ott said on
July 30 that the developer is in talks with two institutional
investors and expects to sell the building for less than a
previously planned 140 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
