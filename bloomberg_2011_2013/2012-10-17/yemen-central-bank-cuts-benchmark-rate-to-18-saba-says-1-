Yemen ’s central bank reduced the
 interest rate  on deposits by 2 percentage points to 18 percent,
the state Saba news agency reported, citing Governor Mohamed
Awad Bin Humam.  The rate cut followed a slowdown in inflation due to the
stabilizing of the economy and an increase in foreign reserves,
to $6.2 billion at the end of September from $4.5 billion at the
end of last year, Saba said, without specifying the inflation
rate.  Bin Humam said the interest rate is still very high
compared to inflation and the rates on international markets,
according to Saba. He said commercial banks had expected the
reduction as “many citizens have faced problems in getting
loans from banks,” which charge rates of as much as 27 percent.  Bin Humam said the central bank will continue to monitor
banking developments in light of expectations that donors will
start disbursing money they pledged at recent conferences in
 Riyadh  and  New York , which amounts to $7.9 billion in aid to
support the country’s political transition.  Saudi Arabia  made a $1 billion deposit in Yemen’s central
bank last month in order to help stabilize the currency, which
plunged last year during protests demanding the ouster of former
President Ali Abdullah Saleh. The rial has now recovered to 214
per dollar from 250.  The last time Yemen’s central bank changed the deposit rate
was in 2010, when it was increased from 15 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
