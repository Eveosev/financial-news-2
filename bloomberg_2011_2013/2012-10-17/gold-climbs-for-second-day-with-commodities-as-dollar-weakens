Gold futures rose for the second
straight day as the dollar’s decline spurred demand for the
metal as an alternative investment.  The greenback fell to a four-week low against a basket of
major currencies after Spain kept its investment grade credit
rating from Moody’s Investors Service, easing European fiscal
concerns. Yesterday, gold climbed 0.5 percent as the dollar fell
0.4 percent.  “The weaker dollar is lending support to gold,”  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in
 Chicago , said in a telephone interview.  Gold futures for December delivery climbed 0.4 percent to
settle at $1,753 an ounce at 1:52 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
The price has increased 12 percent this year.  Silver futures for December delivery rose 0.8 percent to
$33.232 an ounce, extending this year’s gain to 19 percent.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
January delivery advanced 1.5 percent to $1,670.50 an ounce.
Palladium futures for December delivery surged 2.3 percent to
$653.40 an ounce, the biggest jump for a most-active contract
since Oct. 4.  To contact the reporters on this story:
