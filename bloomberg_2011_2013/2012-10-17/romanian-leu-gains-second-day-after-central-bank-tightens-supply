The leu rose for a second day after
 Romania ’s central bank capped funding for lenders at its one-
week repurchase agreements auction, tightening  money supply .  The currency gained less than 0.1 percent to 4.5738 per
euro at 12:18 p.m. in Bucharest, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Yields on 2018 euro-denominated bonds fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 4.063 percent.  The central bank capped lending to commercial banks at 6
billion lei ($1.7 billion) on Oct. 15 for a second time this
month, supporting the leu. Demand for funding at the one-week
repo auction rose to a record high of 21.4 billion lei. The
bank’s decision to limit liquidity for commercial banks on Oct.
8 followed the currency weakening to a two-month low on Oct. 5.  The central bank’s “liquidity management kept losses in
check,”  BRD-Groupe Societe Generale SA (BRD)  analysts wrote in a note
to clients today.  The analysts expect the leu to trade between 4.55 per euro
and 4.60 per euro today, according to the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
