Vietnam ’s government bonds fell,
driving the three-year yield to a five-month high, on concern
faster inflation will hurt demand for fixed-income assets. The
dong weakened.  “Inflation may continue to pick up toward the end of the
year due to holiday-season spending,” said Do Hoang Quynh
Trang, a fixed-income trader at Ocean Commercial Joint-Stock
Bank in Hanoi. “There’s very little trading since everyone
seems to wait for a clearer view of the economic situation.”  Policy makers plan to help companies boost sales to reduce
inventories that are at “high levels,” according to a posting
on the government website that cited Planning and Investment
Minister Bui Quang Vinh at a meeting with the National Assembly
yesterday. Annual  consumer-price  gains quickened to 6.48 percent
in September from 5.04 percent in August, official data show.  The benchmark  three-year  bond yield added one basis point,
or 0.01 percentage point, to 10.24 percent, the highest level
since May 3, according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by
Bloomberg.  The dong weakened to 20,865 per dollar as of 2:30 p.m. in
Hanoi, from 20,848 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The central bank set its  reference rate  at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the
fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
