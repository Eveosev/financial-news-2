Check Point Software Technologies
Ltd. (CHKP) , the world’s second-largest security networks maker,
tumbled the most since 2003 in New York on concern revenue
growth will slacken after third-quarter billings fell.  Check Point, based in Tel Aviv, sank 13 percent to $41.40
by 11:37 a.m. in New York, leading declines on the  Bloomberg
Israel-US Equity Index (ISRA25BN)  of the most-traded Israeli companies in
the U.S. Shares are down 21 percent this year, poised for the
biggest annual slump since 2002.  Third-quarter billings dropped 1 percent in the third
quarter because of falling demand in Europe, according to Nomura
Holdings Inc. and FBN Securities Inc. More competition from
Santa Clara, California-based  Palo Alto Networks Inc. (PANW) , is also
taking away market share from the company, Nomura and FBN said.  “The billings number looked quite weak,” Richard Sherlund, an analyst at Nomura Holdings said by phone in New
York today. “Europe was a big part of it and  Palo Alto  has been
taking away sales opportunities.”  Sales for the three months ended September rose 7.8 percent
to $332 million, according to an e-mailed statement today. Check
Point forecast fourth-quarter revenue of $355 million to $387
million, which compares with the $382 million average estimate
of 27 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
