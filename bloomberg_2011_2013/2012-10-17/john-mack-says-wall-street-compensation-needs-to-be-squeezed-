Former  Morgan Stanley (MS)  Chief
Executive Officer John Mack said compensation on Wall Street
needs to be lowered as firms face higher capital requirements
and focus on reducing risk.  “One area that has to be squeezed is the compensation
number,” Mack said today on Bloomberg Television in an
interview with  Erik Schatzker  and Stephanie Ruhle.  Mack said compensation before the financial crisis was
“unbelievably generous.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
