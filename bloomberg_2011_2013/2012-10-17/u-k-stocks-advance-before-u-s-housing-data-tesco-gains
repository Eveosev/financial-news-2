The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index climbed to
a one-month high after an unexpected drop in the country’s
unemployment and a surge in U.S. new-house construction.  Tesco (TSCO)  Plc increased 2.7 percent after UBS AG recommended
investors buy shares of Britain’s largest retailer. Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc rose more 2.2 percent after the lender
agreed to leave the U.K.’s Asset Protection Scheme. Rio Tinto
Group led mining shares higher, advancing 4 percent.  The FTSE 100 Index rose 40.37 points, or 0.7 percent, to
5,910.91 at the close in  London , the highest since Sept. 14. The
gauge has rallied 2 percent so far this week bolstered by
better-than-forecast U.S. retail and industrial-output data. The
FTSE All-Share Index added 0.7 percent today, while Ireland’s
ISEQ Index gained 0.2 percent.  “Economic data has helped to limit the downward pressure
in the U.S. and  Europe ,” said Ishaq Siddiqi, market strategist
at ETX Capital in London. The U.K. jobs data “is very
encouraging and will undoubtedly raise questions about the need
for more quantitative easing, but importantly, suggests the U.K.
economy is back on track to growth.”  The Office for National Statistics showed  jobless claims  in
the U.K. fell 4,000 in September from the previous month to 1.57
million, boosted by the London Olympics. The median economist
estimate in a Bloomberg News Survey called for no change in
claims.  A wider measure of unemployment, measured by International
Labor Organization methods, declined to  7.9 percent  between June
and August. Employment surged 212,000 to 29.6 million, the
highest since records began in 1971.  Stimulus Debate  The Bank of England said in minutes from its Oct. 3-4
meeting that policy makers were split on the need for more
stimulus before next month’s decision on whether to extend their
asset-purchase program or end it.  The Monetary Policy Committee had voted 9-0 to keep its
bond-purchase target at 375 billion pounds ($605 billion),
according to the minutes released today. It was also unanimous
in holding the benchmark interest rate at 0.5 percent.  In the U.S., Commerce Department data today showed new-home
construction jumped 15 percent in September to an 872,000 annual
rate, the most since July 2008 and exceeding all forecasts in a
Bloomberg survey of economists.  Tesco, RBS  Tesco gained 2.7 percent to 316.3 pence after UBS raised
its recommendation for the retailer to buy from neutral and
added the shares to its most preferred list.  UBS analysts Mike Tarrersall and Benjamin Peters cited the
company’s “cash-focused” strategy that could see Tesco buy
back almost 8 billion pounds of equity and return about 60
percent of market capitalization to investors in cash, including
dividends by February 2018.  RBS (RBS)  rose 2.2 percent to 286.1 pence after the lender agreed
to leave the Asset Protection Scheme, removing another obstacle
for its return to private ownership.  Britain’s biggest taxpayer-owned bank agreed to paid 2.5
billion pounds to the government to insure its most risky
assets. RBS was the the only lender in 2009 to join the program
which covered potential losses on 282 billion pounds of loans
and derivatives.  A gauge of U.K.-listed mining companies climbed 3.5 percent
as base metals advanced on the London Metal Exchange.  Rio Tinto rallied 4 percent to 3,184 pence after Agence
France Presse reported that the company is planning to cut 30
percent of its workforce in Europe by the end of 2013, citing
union official Veronique Roche.  The world’s third-largest mining company employs about
2,700 people in Europe, AFP reported, citing Roche.  BHP Output  BHP Billiton Ltd (BHP)  gained 3.3 percent to 2,014 pence. The
world’s largest mining company today said first-quarter iron-ore
production was little changed from the previous year at 39.77
million metric tons.  BHP also said it expects  China ’s growth to fall to about 7
to 8 percent this year and remain at that level for the next
decade as the nation becomes a consumer-led economy.  BP Plc (BP/)  rose 3 percent to 448.35 pence after people with
knowledge of the matter said the company and its Russian
billionaire partners are in talks to sell control of their TNK-
BP venture to OAO Rosneft.  The billionaires, represented by the AAR group, are seeking
to sell their 50 percent holding to Rosneft for $28 billion, one
person said, declining to be identified before a deal is
completed. BP is also negotiating to sell at least some of its
shares, another person said.  Officials from AAR, Rosneft and BP declined to comment.  Ashtead, 888  Ashtead Group Plc (AHT) , a U.K. construction-equipment rental
company, climbed 3.2 percent to 356.4 pence after U.S. peer
United Rentals Inc. reported third-quarter earnings that beat
estimates. Analysts at Jefferies Inc. and Seymour Pierce Ltd.
also raised their price estimates for Ashtead’s shares by more
than 10 percent to 400 pence.  888 Holdings Plc (888)  advanced 18 percent to 109 pence, the
highest since March 2010, after the online-gambling company said
full-year earnings will “significantly” beat market
expectations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
