Doosan Heavy Industries (034020)  &
Construction Co.,  South Korea â€™s biggest power generator
producer, won an order to build a 24-megawatt onshore wind farm
in Incheon, South Korea for a unit of  Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEP)   The Changwon, South Korea-based company was chosen by Korea
South-East Power Co. for design, procurement and construction of
the project, the unit of Doosan Group said today in an e-mailed
statement, without giving a value for the project. The farm will
begin commercial operations in July.  Doosan won a domestic wind farm order for the first time in
November 2011, and has secured orders for 72-megawatt wind
farms, including the latest one, in South Korea, it said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
