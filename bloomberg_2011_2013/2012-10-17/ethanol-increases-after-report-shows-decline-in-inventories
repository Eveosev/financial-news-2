Ethanol futures snapped a three-day
decline as the Energy Department reported that inventories fell
1.4 percent last week.  The biofuel gained as  stockpiles  fell 1.4 percent to 19
million barrels and  production  slipped 0.4 percent to 797,000
barrels a day. U.S. ethanol is made from corn and blended into
gasoline.  “There was some pessimism you might get a big inventory
build that you didn’t get this week,” said Jerrod Kitt,
director of research at Linn Group in  Chicago . “I think that
probably helped the market.”  Denatured ethanol for November delivery climbed 1.6 cents,
or 0.7 percent, to $2.391 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The price has risen 8.5 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol increased 0.5 cent to $2.47
a gallon in  New York , 2.5 cents to $2.39 in Chicago and 1.5
cents to $2.45 on the  Gulf Coast . It fell 3 cents to $2.535 on
the West Coast.  Corn for December delivery increased 7.25 cents to $7.455 a
bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of
ethanol.  Crude oil for November delivery climbed 3 cents to $92.12 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Gasoline for November delivery slid 6.36 cents to $2.7817 a
gallon on the Nymex, the fifth consecutive decline. The contract
covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol
before delivery to filling stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
