Mahindra & Mahindra Financial
Services Ltd. (MMFS) , the auto-loans unit of  India â€™s largest tractor
maker, has picked three banks including  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and JM
Financial Services Pvt Ltd. to manage a share sale to
institutions, said two people with knowledge of the matter.  Mahindra also picked Kotak Mahindra Capital Co. for the
sale, expected this quarter, the people said, asking not to be
named as the process is private. The company said on Oct. 9 that
its board approved raising 9.25 billion rupees ($175 million).  Indian companies are looking at raising equity capital as
the benchmark BSE India Sensitive Index climbed to its highest
levels in more than a year on renewed investor interest
following government reforms.  Separately,  Apollo Tyres Ltd. (APTY)  also approved a $150 million
share sale to institutions this month. Apollo has chosen
 Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  and  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  to manage the share
sale, one person with knowledge of the matter said.  Sunil Gate, a spokesman for Mahindra and Mahindra, declined
to comment. Rohit Sharan, a spokesman for Apollo, declined to
comment beyond the stock exchange notice.  To contact the reporters on this story:
