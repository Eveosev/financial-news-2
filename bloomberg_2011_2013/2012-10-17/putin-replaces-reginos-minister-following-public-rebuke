Russian President  Vladimir Putin 
fired Regional Development Minister Oleg Govorun following a
public rebuke last month.  Putin named Igor Slyunyayev, who stepped down as governor
of the Kostroma region in April, to replace him, the
presidential administration said today in an e-mailed statement.
The ministry hasn’t addressed problems faced by families with
multiple children or transport issues plaguing residents in
Siberia and the  Far East , Putin said in September.  Govorun’s dismissal is the first since the Cabinet was
formed less than five months ago by Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev , who agreed last year not to challenge Putin’s plans to
return to the presidency. Putin said he’d worked with many of
the officials for years in the government or presidential
administration, and that individuals named to lead ministries
bear a higher degree of responsibility.  “If something ordered isn’t fulfilled, then there must be
responsibility for that, and the responsibility must be carried
personally,” Putin said at a government meeting Sept. 19,
according to a Kremlin  transcript . “It’s nothing personal. I
want you to know it’s nothing personal.”  In addition to Govorun, Putin also  ordered  Medvedev to
reprimand Labor Minister Maxim Topilin and Education and Science
Minister Dmitry Livanov. At the same meeting, Putin also
criticized the government for foot-dragging on a pension-reform
overhaul being prepared by Topilin’s ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
