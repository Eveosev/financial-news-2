(Corrects currency in headline and first paragraph.)  Penn West Petroleum Ltd. (PWT)  agreed to
sell non-core properties for C$1.3 billion.  The company, based in Calgary, anticipates the sales will
close by the end of the year, according to a statement today.
Penn West didnâ€™t specify the buyer.  The assets have combined production of the equivalent of
about 12,000 barrels of oil a day. Penn West plans to use the
proceeds to repay advances under its credit facilities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
