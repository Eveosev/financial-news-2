Food security levels declined in 98
out of 105 countries between June and September because of
rising food prices, the Economist Intelligence Unit reported.  The score for affordability of food dropped to 50.5 on a
scale of 100 from 53.2 previously, the researcher wrote in an e-
mailed statement today.  Hungary , Brazil,  Argentina  and Russia
had the biggest drops in affordability of food on a combination
of economic weakness and inflation, the unit wrote.  Global food prices have advanced 7.7 percent from June,
according to the EIU. An index of 55 food items tracked by the
 United Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization climbed to a
six-month high in September.  “High and volatile food prices limit the ability of
households to climb out of poverty,” Leo Abruzzese, director of
global forecasting at the EIU, was cited as saying in the
statement. Price swings “can make it more difficult for
households to cope and can lead to a decline in purchasing power
and calorie consumption,” he said.  Among the most undernourished countries, the biggest drops
in food affordability were recorded in  South Africa , the
Dominican Republic, Guatemala and Botswana, according to the
report.  The U.S. ranks highest for food security of the 105
countries tracked by the researcher, based on affordability,
availability and quality and safety, followed by Norway and
Denmark. The  Democratic Republic  of Congo scores the lowest,
followed by Chad and Burundi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
