Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung
Chun-ying appointed Regina Ip and Jeffrey Lam as non-official
members of his executive council, according to a government
statement today.  Ip, 62, is chairperson of the New People’s Party and a
former security secretary, the government said. Lam, 60, is a
lawmaker and managing director of Forward Winsome Industries
Ltd., it said.  Ip failed in her attempt in February to win enough
nominations to enter the race to be Hong Kong’s next chief
executive.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
