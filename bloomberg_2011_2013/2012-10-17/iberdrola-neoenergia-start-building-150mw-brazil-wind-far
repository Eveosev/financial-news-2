Iberdrola SA (IBE) , the world’s second-
biggest wind-farm operator, said it started building the 150-
megawatt Calango project in  Brazil ’s  Rio Grande  do Norte state
with Brazilian group Neoenergia SA.  The project is divided into five equal-sized wind farms,
Bilbao-based Iberdrola said today in an e-mailed statement.
Iberdrola and Neoenergia are building 10 projects totaling 288
megawatts in the Latin American nation, it said. Iberdrola has a
39 percent share in Neoenergia.  The Calango project is scheduled to start operating at the
end of next year, Iberdrola said. The five 30-megawatt wind
farms, along with five other farms the partners are working on,
are using Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA wind turbines and will
provide enough power for 450,000 people, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
