Republican  Chris Christie  faces some
competition more than a year before New Jersey’s next election
for governor, a voter survey released today shows.  Newark Mayor  Cory Booker , a Democrat who has allied with
Christie on some education issues, trailed the first-term
governor by 4 percentage points in a theoretical 2013 matchup,
the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute said.  Christie, who has yet to say whether he’ll seek a second
term, would beat Booker, 46 percent to 42 percent, the survey
shows. The governor’s approval rating rose to 56 percent from 53
percent in a Sept. 5 poll, though it trails a record reached in
April, according to the school in Hamden, Connecticut.  “Booker could give Governor Christie a run for his money,
if the mayor decides to run,”  Maurice Carroll , the institute’s
director, said in a statement with the poll results. “Let’s see
how the field shapes up if Booker takes a pass.”  Booker, 43, is midway through his second four-year term as
mayor of the state’s largest city. A graduate of  Stanford
University  and  Yale Law School , he gained visibility when
Facebook founder  Mark Zuckerberg  pledged $100 million to support
the impoverished city’s school system.  More than half of those queried, 52 percent, said Christie
deserves re-election next year. The governor’s next closest
hypothetical 2013 challenger was Richard Codey, a Senate
Democrat from Roseland who served more than a year as governor
following the resignation of James McGreevey. Codey trailed
Christie 41 percent to 47 percent in the Quinnipiac poll.  Democrats hold a 700,000-voter registration advantage in
the state and control the Assembly, 48-32, and the Senate, 24-
16. Christie became the first Republican elected governor in New
Jersey since 1997 when he ousted Democrat  Jon Corzine  in 2009.
His approval rating reached 59 percent in an April Quinnipiac
Poll.  The telephone survey of 1,405 registered voters Oct. 10-14
had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.6 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
