The biggest surge in Russian share
sales since 2007 is blunting gains in the market spurred by the
 Federal Reserve ’s third round of asset buying.  Russia’s  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  climbed an average 77 percent during
the Fed’s first two courses of so-called quantitative easing and
slipped 0.6 percent during periods without stimulus, the biggest
difference of 46 emerging and developed markets tracked by
Bloomberg. Since the announcement of QE3 on Sept. 13 to
yesterday’s close, the Micex has lost 1.1 percent, compared with
a 2.2 percent advance in the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index, as  OAO
Sberbank (SBRCY)  raised 159.3 billion rubles ($5.2 billion) in the
largest share sale by a Russian company since before the global
recession.  Russia-domiciled companies have issued $6.64 billion of
stock in 2012, the most since the $22.4 billion raised in 2007,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Phone company OAO MegaFon is
poised to add to that tally, with its initial public offering
valued at as much as $11 billion, people familiar with the plans
say. The Micex Index dropped less than 0.1 percent to 1,455.47
by 12:48 p.m. in Moscow today.  “Sberbank’s secondary public offering sucked out most of
the liquidity from the Russian market,” Mikhail Akramovsky, who
manages $850 million in Russian assets at Allianz Rosno Asset
Management in Moscow, said by phone yesterday. “The free cash
that people had and wanted to use after QE3 went into Sberbank.
Now people are preparing for Megafon’s IPO, which isn’t
supporting the market either.”  The  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of Russian U.S.-listed
stocks added 0.5 percent yesterday, paring this month’s 5.6
percent drop, and  RTS stock-index futures  were steady at 148,310
in  New York .  Russia ETF Gains  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the biggest U.S.-traded
exchange-traded fund that holds Russian shares, rose 0.5 percent
to $29.02. The fund gained 10 percent in the third quarter. The
RTS Volatility Index climbed 0.9 percent to 26.76.  Output at U.S. factories, mines and utilities climbed 0.4
percent in September, beating the median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg, after a 1.4 percent drop in August that
was the biggest since March 2009, according to data from the
Federal Reserve released in  Washington  yesterday.  “People are back to taking risk,”  Alec Young , a global
equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ, said by phone from New York
yesterday. “Investors are getting more confident about global
growth.”  The Moscow-listed stock of Sberbank, Russia’s biggest
lender, has dropped 2.7 percent since its Sept. 18 offering,
while shares of VTB Group, the second-largest bank who raised $8
billion in a 2007 IPO, have slumped 5.9 percent.  Mail.ru Offerings  American depositary receipts of OAO Sberbank added 2.5
percent to $12.06 in New York yesterday, the most since Sept.
14. The ADRs settled at a 1.1 percent premium versus the bank’s
Moscow-traded shares, the widest in a week. Sberbank’s  stock 
gained 0.2 percent to 92.28 rubles in Moscow today. Each ADR
represents four ordinary shares.  The sale of a minority stake in Sberbank followed a $266
million IPO by oil exporter  RusPetro Plc (RPO)  in January, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Internet company  Mail.ru Group Ltd. (MAIL) 
had two share sales this year amounting to $530 million, OAO
Moscow Bearing, a bearing manufacturer, raised $500 million in
an additional offering, and Moscow-based retailer M.Video sold
$146 million of stock, the data show.  MD Medical Group Investments Plc, which runs Russia’s
largest chain of maternity centers and is domiciled in Cyprus,
raised $311 million in an Oct. 12 IPO in  London .  “We’ve digested a decent amount of new issuance, and in an
environment where inflows have been muted, to then add to new
issuances, it could be tricky for the engines to fully push us
forward,” Farhan Kazmi, head of emerging-market equities at
Credit Suisse Securities in Moscow, said by phone on Oct. 12.  IPO Postponed  OAO Promsvyazbank, the nation’s third-largest privately
owned lender by assets, deferred its IPO on Oct. 15, saying the
offers it was getting for its shares didn’t reflect “fair
value” for the bank. The Moscow-based lender may revisit the
postponement once market conditions improve, according to its
statement.  The Micex trades at 5.6 times analysts’ earnings estimates,
the cheapest among the largest emerging equity markets.
Companies in  India ’s BSE India Sensitive Index trade at a ratio
of 14.7, compared with 14.2 for shares in  Brazil ’s Bovespa index
and 9.8 for the Shanghai Composite Index.  Mechel Rises  OAO Mechel (MTL) , Russia’s biggest producer of coal for
steelmakers, advanced 1.6 percent to $6.83 in New York. The ADRs
were the second biggest gainers on the gauge after Sberbank. The
stock lost 0.2 percent to 210.40 rubles, or $6.83, in Moscow
today.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials
climbed less than 0.1 percent to 664.36 in New York today.  “There is a splash of optimism fueled by an increase in
commodities prices,” Vladimir Tikhomirov, chief economist at
Otkritie Capital in Moscow, said by phone from Moscow yesterday.  Crude oil for November delivery advanced 0.1 percent to
$92.20 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  today. Urals
crude,  Russia ’s chief export blend, rose less than 0.1 percent
to $113.40 per barrel yesterday.  A U.S. Energy Department report will show that U.S. crude
oil inventories rose  1.5 million barrels  last week, according to
the median of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The
department is scheduled to release its weekly report at 10:30
a.m. today in Washington.  United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer,
dropped 0.2 percent to HK$4.30 in  Hong Kong  as of the city’s
noon trading break. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 1.1
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
