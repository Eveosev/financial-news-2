Rajat Gupta, the former  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  director who’s appealing his conviction for
 insider trading , said he shouldn’t have to pay the firm as much
as $7 million in legal fees and other expenses.  Gupta, 64, who sat on the board of New York-based Goldman
Sachs and Cincinnati-based  Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) , was convicted
of passing information he gathered at board meetings to Galleon
Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam. Goldman Sachs, supported by
U.S. prosecutors in the case, is seeking restitution from Gupta
as a victim of Gupta’s fraud.  Goldman Sachs has “not even begun to satisfy its burden of
showing the fees are recoverable,” Gupta said in papers filed
today in Manhattan federal court.  Gupta was convicted by a jury in June of one count of
conspiracy and three counts of  securities fraud . The federal
appeals court in New York said that it will hear Gupta’s appeal
as early as April 1. It ruled he may remain free on $10 million
bail while it considers the case.  The case is U.S. v. Gupta, 12-4448, U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
