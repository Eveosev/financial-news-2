European Central Bank Governing
Council member Erkki Liikanen will appear before U.K. lawmakers
to testify on his proposals to overhaul European Union banks.  Liikanen will testify on Oct. 22 to the Parliamentary
Commission on Banking Standards, a cross-party panel created in
the wake of the Libor-fixing scandal. Donald Cruickshank, former
chairman of the  London Stock Exchange (LSE)  and John Kay of Oxford
University will testify later in the month.  European Union banks should be forced to push much of their
trading activities into separately capitalized units and face
extra bonus rules, a European Union-mandated working group
chaired by Liikanen has proposed.  The group also called for a toughening of Basel bank
capital rules and for a share of bonus awards for executives to
be paid in debt designed to be written down in crises. The non-
binding recommendations are part of a detailed blueprint to
protect taxpayers from bailouts.  Former Federal Reserve Chairman  Paul Volcker , who advised
President  Barack Obama , will give evidence to the same panel
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
