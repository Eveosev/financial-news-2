Apollo Group Inc. (APOL) , the largest U.S.
for-profit college chain, fell the most in two years after
forecasting revenue for  fiscal 2013  that missed analysts’
estimates and announcing it would close campuses and cut jobs.  Apollo, which operates the University of Phoenix, has
dropped 59 percent this year, making it the worst-performing
stock in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Fewer students are signing up to attend Apollo and other
for-profit colleges amid high U.S. unemployment and federal and
state investigations raising questions about the schools’ loan
defaults and marketing claims. Apollo’s results demonstrate that
investors should avoid the education industry, said  Peter Appert , an analyst with Piper Jaffray & Co. in  San Francisco .  “Education stocks are value traps, burdened by a downward
bias in estimates, limited enrollment visibility and
increasingly intense competitive dynamics,” Appert, who has a
neutral  rating  on shares, wrote in a note to investors today.  Apollo dropped 20 percent to $21.96 at 1:46 p.m. in  New
York , the most since October 2010. A Bloomberg index of 13
education stocks slid as much as 8.4 percent, the biggest drop
in more than seven months.  For the year ending in August 2013, sales will be $3.65
billion to $3.8 billion, Phoenix-based Apollo said yesterday in
a statement. Analysts on average projected revenue of $4.07
billion, based on  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Over the past
year, enrollment at the University of Phoenix fell 14 percent to
328,400 students.  ‘More Nimble’  The company said it will take steps to reduce annual
operating expenses by at least $300 million by 2014. It will
close 115 University of Phoenix locations, including 25 campuses
and 90 smaller centers. The company will continue to operate 112
locations. Apollo is also cutting 800  jobs  over the next fiscal
year, according to the statement.  “We’re positioning ourselves to be more nimble, more
competitive and more successful for all of our stakeholders in
Apollo,” Chief Executive Officer Greg Cappelli said yesterday
on a conference call with analysts.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch lowered its rating on Apollo
today to “neutral” from “buy.”  Net income in the  fourth quarter  ended Aug. 31 fell 60
percent to $75.4 million, or 66 cents a share, from $188.6
million, or $1.37, a year earlier, Apollo said. Profit excluding
some items was 52 cents a share, topping the 49-cent average of
analysts’ estimates.  Sales in the three-month period declined 11 percent to
$996.5 million, below the average $1.01 billion estimate of
analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
