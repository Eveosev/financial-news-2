The Congress of South African Trade
Unions said it will endorse President  Jacob Zuma  for a second
term as leader of the ruling African National Congress at the
party’s election in December.  Cosatu will also back Deputy President  Kgalema Motlanthe 
and Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe, the nation’s largest labor
federation said in an e-mailed statement today. Cosatu will not
support Treasurer Mathews Phoza and Deputy Secretary-General
Thandi Modise, according to the statement.  “We will engage with the current leadership and the rest
of the ANC to ensure that this nucleus is retained and that it
should not contest each other,” Cosatu said.  Zuma is running to retain his post as the number of ANC
members from his native KwaZulu-Natal province has tripled since
he ousted Thabo Mbeki as head of the party in 2007. Delegates
from the nation’s nine provinces will vote in December to elect
their leaders. Former ANC Youth League President  Julius Malema 
has said he will back Motlanthe to replace Zuma.  To contact the reporter on this story:
