Egypt’s Chemical & Fertilizers
Export Council warned that the government’s decision to cut the
amount of gas supplied to fertilizer companies by 60 percent
will reduce production and exports, and boost the black market,
the state-run Middle East  News Agency  reported.  The decision will hurt the country’s exports of
fertilizers, MENA said, citing Walid Helal, head of the group.  Egypt says it plans gradually to remove subsidies for the
cement, fertilizer and iron and steel industries in an effort to
reduce the  budget deficit .  To contact the reporter on this story:
