Gasoline fell after the Energy
Department said stockpiles increased last week more than
analysts forecast.  Prices slipped after  inventories  of the motor fuel rose
1.72 million barrels to 197.1 million in the seven days ended
Oct. 12. Supplies were expected to climb 500,000 barrels,
according to the  median  estimate of nine analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  “The inventory built far more than the market had
expected,”  Andy Lipow , president of Houston-based Lipow Oil
Associates LLC, said by phone. “And not only that, the
production of gasoline rebounded this week from low levels last
week as refiners are returning from both scheduled and
unscheduled maintenance activities.”  Gasoline for November delivery fell 5.35 cents, or 1.9
percent, to $2.7918 a gallon at 10:36 a.m. on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.  Inventories of distillates, including heating oil and
diesel, fell 2.22 million barrels to 118.7 million last week,
more than the expected decline of 1.5 million barrels, according
to survey.  November-delivery heating oil fell 2.2 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $3.1765 a gallon on the exchange.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, slipped
1.7 cents to $3.756 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA, the
nation’s largest motoring organization.  To contact the reporters on this story:
