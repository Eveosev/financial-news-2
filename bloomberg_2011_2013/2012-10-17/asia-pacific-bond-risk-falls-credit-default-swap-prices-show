The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default declined, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 6 basis points to
138 basis points as of 11:10 a.m. in Sydney, according to
 Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  The gauge is on
course for its lowest close since Sept. 19, according to data
provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 5 to 117.5 as of 8:20 a.m. in  Hong
Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices show. The measure
is also set for its lowest close since Sept. 19, according to
CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index slid 6 basis points to 212 as
of 9:08 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices show. The benchmark
is on track for the lowest close since Sept. 21, according to
CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
