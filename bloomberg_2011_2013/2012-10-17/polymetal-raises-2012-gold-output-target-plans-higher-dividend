Polymetal International Plc (POLY) , a
Russian gold miner on London’s FTSE 100 index, raised its output
target and changed the dividend policy to increase payouts.  Polymetal expects to produce 1.05 million ounces of gold
equivalent this year, 5 percent more than previously forecast,
the St. Petersburg-based company said today in a statement,
citing a “strong performance.” Third-quarter output jumped 48
percent from a year earlier to 317,000 ounces, while sales
probably rose 42 percent to $530 million, Polymetal said.  Gold producers have expanded to benefit from prices that
have advanced for 11 straight years. Polyus Gold International
Ltd., which focuses on  Russia , said in August that first-half
profit more than doubled as output climbed, while  Petropavlovsk
Plc (POG)  said yesterday that nine-month gold volumes rose 11 percent.  Polymetal’s growth this year has been led by the Dukat and
Omolon mines, Chief Executive Officer Vitaly Nesis said by phone
from  St. Petersburg . The company cut its 2013 output target to
1.2 million ounces from 1.3 million ounces after shifting the
start of its Mayskoye project to next April from December.  “If you look at the combined 2012-2013 production target,
the overall reduction is small, just 50,000 ounces,” Nesis
said. The company’s 2014 guidance of 1.4 million ounces remains
unchanged.  Polymetal’s board revised its dividend policy to boost the
payout to 30 percent of net income from 20 percent. That share
is conditional on net debt staying below 1.75 times earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, it said.  Special Dividend  The new policy structure also allows the company to pay
dividends twice a year “as  London  investors are accustomed
to,” Nesis said.  The board may discuss introducing special dividends in
December once capital-spending plans for 2013 are agreed on.
“If we see that we’ve earned a big profit, with capex not that
large, we’ll use the money to pay a special dividend,” Nesis
said, declining to comment on the likely size of the payout.  Capital expenditure in 2012 will probably reach $300
million, compared with previous guidance of $250 million,
Polymetal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
