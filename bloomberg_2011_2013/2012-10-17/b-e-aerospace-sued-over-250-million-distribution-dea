B/E Aerospace Inc. (BEAV) , a maker of cabin
interiors for commercial and business aircraft, was sued for
allegedly breaking a contract for distribution of oxygen-systems
products.  Leki Aviation, a closely held distributor of aircraft
parts, interiors and components, filed the suit today in New
York State Supreme Court in  Manhattan , accusing Wellington,
Florida-based B/E Aerospace of wrongful termination of a five-
year agreement to distribute B/E oxygen-systems products. The
value of the agreement would exceed $250 million in direct sales
of B/E products alone, Leki said in the complaint.  Leki, based in Kastrup,  Denmark , accused B/E of making
false and misleading statements to get Leki to accept a lower
discount rate on B/E products so B/E could use the agreement as
leverage in pricing sales to Airbus SAS and its Satair unit,
according to the complaint.  The suit, which seeks unspecified compensatory,
consequential and punitive damages, also accuses Toulouse,
France-based Airbus and its Satair unit of interfering with the
contract by forcing B/E to terminate the pact.  “B/E further made these material false and untrue
representations to Leki, with the intent to deceive Leki, and
with the intent to cause Leki, a Satair competitor, to change
its competitive position in the marketplace and thereby provide
B/E products an additional unfair market advantage,” Leki said
in its complaint.  Greg Powell, a spokesman for B/E Aerospace, didn’t
immediately respond to e-mail and voice messages seeking comment
on the lawsuit.  Airbus doesn’t comment on lawsuits, Mary Anne Greczyn, a
Virginia-based spokeswoman for the company, said in an e-mail.  The case is Leki Aviation A/S v. B/E Aerospace,
653625/2012,  New York  State Supreme Court, New York County
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
