Springleaf Finance Corp., the
subprime lender that’s been raising cash to repay maturing debt
by packaging older mortgages into bonds, plans to sell $787
million of home-loan securities.  The firm, which is mostly owned by Fortress Investment
Group LLC, may sell the bonds this week, including $538.5
million of debt with AAA ratings, according to a person familiar
with the offering who asked not to be identified because the
terms aren’t set. Some notes created in the $900 million
securitization aren’t being offered, the person said.  Springleaf issued mortgage bonds backed by older loans in
two deals totaling $1.4 billion earlier this year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Fortress purchased 80 percent of the
Evansville, Indiana-based lender, then known as American General
Finance Inc., from  American International Group Inc. (AIG)  in 2010 for
$125 million, taking $17 billion of debt off the bailed-out
insurer’s balance sheet.  Springleaf exited real-estate lending at the start of this
year to focus on other consumer financing and its insurance
operations, it said in March in a U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission  filing .  To contact the reporter on this story:
