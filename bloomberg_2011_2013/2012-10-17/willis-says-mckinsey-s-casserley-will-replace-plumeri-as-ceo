Willis Group Holdings Plc (WSH) , the
third-largest insurance broker, said Joe Plumeri will step down
after 12 years as chief executive officer to be replaced
McKinsey & Co.’s Dominic Casserley.  Casserley, 54, will succeed Plumeri on Jan. 7, the London-
based broker said in a statement today. Plumeri, 69, will remain
as non-executive chairman until the end of July, the firm said.  Plumeri, who became CEO in 2000 when KKR & Co. owned the
company, took the firm public the following year. Since then, he
expanded the company overseas, bought Hilb Rogal & Hobbs in
2008, and moved Willis’s corporate headquarters to  London . The
firm earns fees for arranging insurance policies for clients.  Casserley, a graduate of Britain’s Cambridge University,
joined McKinsey in 1983. He led the consultant’s operations in
China, as well as the U.K. and Ireland and has spent 12 years in
the U.S., a further 12 in Europe and five in  Asia . He will be
based in Willis’s  New York  office following a transition period
next year, the firm said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
