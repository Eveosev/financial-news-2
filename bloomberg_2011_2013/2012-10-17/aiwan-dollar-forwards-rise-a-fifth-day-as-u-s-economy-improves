Taiwan dollar  forwards rose to a
five-month high as signs of improvement in the U.S., the world’s
largest economy, spurred demand for emerging-market assets and
brightened the outlook for Asian exports.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar index rose 0.1 percent,
advancing for a fifth day, after data showed U.S. industrial
production rose and earnings topped estimates at almost three
quarters of companies in the  S&P 500  that have released results
so far.  Taiwan ’s export orders gained 1.9 percent in September
from a year earlier, after dropping 1.5 percent the previous
month, a Bloomberg survey showed before data due tomorrow.  “Global sentiment is better for Asian currencies,” said
Tarsicio Tong, a currency trader at  Union Bank of Taiwan (2838)  in
Taipei. “There could be some kind of adjustment from the
central bank, to make the appreciation in the Taiwan dollar
slower.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards traded at NT$29.110 as
of 5:17 p.m. in Taipei, from NT$29.12 yesterday, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts reached NT$29.071
earlier, the strongest level since May 9, and are at a 0.5
percent premium to the spot rate.  In the  spot market , the local currency strengthened 0.2
percent to NT$29.246 against its U.S. counterpart, data from
Taipei Forex Inc. showed. It touched NT$29.142 earlier, the
strongest level since May 2. The Taiwan dollar may reach NT$29
in the next two weeks, Tong predicted. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, increased one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
3.50 percent.  Taiwan’s central bank has intervened to stem advances in
the currency in late trading on most days in the past five
months, according to traders who asked not to be identified.  The yield on the 2 percent government bonds due July 2017
was little changed at 0.88 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market. The  overnight interbank lending  rate was
steady at 0.387 percent, a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
