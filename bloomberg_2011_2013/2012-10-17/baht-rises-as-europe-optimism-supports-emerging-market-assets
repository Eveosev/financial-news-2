Thailand ’s government bonds rose,
pushing the five-year yield down by the  most  since August 2011,
after the central bank unexpectedly cut its benchmark interest
rate for the first time since January to support the economy.  The yield dropped to the lowest level in two months after
the Bank of Thailand reduced its one-day bond repurchase  rate  by
a quarter of a percentage point to 2.75 percent, a move
predicted by only three of the 23 economists in a Bloomberg
survey. The rest forecast no change. Today’s decision to join
 South Korea  and  Brazil  in cutting borrowing costs contrasts with
Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul’s stance in an Oct. 13 interview
that there was no need for a reduction.  “The  bond market  actually expected no rate cut in October
and is adjusting to the policy” decision, said Nalin
Chutchotitham, a Bangkok-based analyst at  Kasikornbank Pcl. (KBANK) 
“Investors will probably expect more rate cuts to come because
of today’s move, which will support the bond market.”  The yield on the 3.25 percent notes due June 2017 slumped
16 basis points, or 0.16 percentage point, to 3.13 percent as of
3:21 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That is the lowest level for the note since Aug. 14.  The baht climbed 0.2 percent to 30.63 per dollar. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, was unchanged at 4.27 percent.  The monetary authority today maintained its forecast for
economic growth in 2012 at 5.7 percent, and said it would reduce
its prediction for 2013. While weak exports will affect local
demand in the future, the  interest-rate  cut is not a sign of a
downward trend, Assistant Governor Paiboon Kittisrikangwan told
a news briefing.  Exports dropped 7 percent in August from a year earlier
after a decline of 4.5 percent in July, official data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
