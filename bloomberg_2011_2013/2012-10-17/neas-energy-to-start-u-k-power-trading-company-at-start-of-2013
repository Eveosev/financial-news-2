Neas Energy A/S , a Danish power
trading company, plans to start a U.K. subsidiary at the
beginning of next year.  The company will open an office outside London in January
or February and hire five to six people, Soren Petersen, senior
vice president of Neas Energy, said today in an interview in
London. U.K. power will be handled from Aalborg,  Denmark , by the
company’s 25 continental power traders, he said.  “We are entering into physical markets and have applied
for supply licenses,” Petersen said. “As an investor you need
clarity in support schemes and regulation in the U.K. creates a
certain amount of uncertainty, in particular the terms and
conditions of the contracts for difference.”  NEAS Energy is a member of the N2EX and APX-Endex exchanges
and is already trading U.K. power on the BritNed interconnector
between the U.K. and the Netherlands, Petersen said.  The company sells 50 megawatts of wind generation in the
U.K. together with Opus Energy Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
