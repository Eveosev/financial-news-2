The  National Hurricane Center  has
ceased issuing advisories for former hurricanes Paul and Rafael
after both lost their tropical characteristics and became normal
weather systems.  Paul became what is called a remnant low in the Pacific
about 15 miles (21 kilometers) west-southwest of Punta Eugenia,
Mexico, while Rafael transitioned into a regular ocean storm in
the Atlantic about 745 miles (1,199 kilometers) southeast of
Halifax,  Nova Scotia .  Rafael will send high waves into the coast of Canada that
may cause dangerous surf and rip currents, while Paul may soak
central  Baja California  with as much as 10 inches of rain, the
Miami-based center said in an advisory just before 5 p.m.  New
York  time.  The decision to stop issuing advisories means the storms
lack the organization and the power of a tropical system.  To contact the reporters on this story:
