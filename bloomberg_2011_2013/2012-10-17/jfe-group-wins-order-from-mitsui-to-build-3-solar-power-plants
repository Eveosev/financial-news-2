JFE Holdings Inc. (5411)  won an order from
 Mitsui & Co. (8031)  and Tokio Marine Asset Management Co. to build
three solar power plants in Japan through subsidiaries.  Four units of JFE Steel, 100 percent owned by the Tokyo-
based company, will supply the plants with the combined capacity
of 8.3 megawatts in Yamaguchi and Wakayama prefectures in
western Japan, the companies said today in a  statement , without
providing the value of the order. The plants will be operational
in the first half of 2013, they said.  Mitsui, Japanâ€™s second-biggest trading company, and Tokio
Marine Asset Management, are working on a project to construct
10 solar power stations across Japan at a total cost of 9
billion yen ($114 million).  The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in  Japan  has
approved clean energy projects totaling 1,780 megawatts of
capacity, with solar accounting for 83 percent, as of the end of
September under a government incentive program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
