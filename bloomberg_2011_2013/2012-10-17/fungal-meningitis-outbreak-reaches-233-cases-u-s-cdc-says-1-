The fungal meningitis outbreak
triggered by a contaminated medication for back pain has been
linked to 16 deaths in the U.S. after  Virginia  authorities said
today that a second patient had died in the state.  Earlier today,  233 illnesses  has been reported in 15
states, killing 15 people, including one in Virginia, according
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A second
Virginia death connected to the outbreak was confirmed later,
the state Department of Health said in a  statement .  A steroid, methylprednisolone acetate, manufactured by New
England Compounding Center in Framingham,  Massachusetts , is
believed by authorities to have triggered the outbreak. About
14,000 people received shots of the drug, contaminated with a
strain of fungus, that were sold by the compounding pharmacy to
75 hospitals and clinics in 23 states, U.S. health regulators
have said. The pharmacy suspended operations two weeks ago and
recalled 17,676 doses of the medicine used as an injection for
back pain.  Meningitis is an inflammation of the lining of the brain
and spinal cord usually caused by an infection from a virus or
bacteria. The version of the illness linked to the outbreak
isnâ€™t contagious and can be treated with anti-fungal medication,
the CDC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
