European Central Bank Executive
Board member Benoit Coeure said policy makers’ pledge to buy the
bonds of distressed euro-area nations is helping to foster
confidence in the irreversibility of the single currency.  “Preserving price stability over the medium term is the
best contribution that monetary policy can make to economic
stability,” Coeure said in a speech in Brussels today. “Our
recent decision to undertake Outright Monetary Transactions can
also be seen in this context, to the extent that it helps to
restore confidence in the integrity and irreversibility of the
single currency.”  Coeure said the ECB’s non-standard measures, which also
include record liquidity provision to the region’s banks, have
prevented “more adverse economic outcomes” by focusing policy
on those countries most affected by the crisis, and ensuring
small- and medium-sized companies can obtain funding.  “The monetary policy measures taken by the ECB have helped
to avoid a collapse in money and credit and to eliminate the
specter of the Great Depression,” Coeure said. “They have not
only avoided a collapse of the financial system, but also, and
more importantly, prevented a surge in unemployment and poverty
in the euro area.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
