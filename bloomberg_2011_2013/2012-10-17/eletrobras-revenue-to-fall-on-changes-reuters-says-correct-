(Corrects the source of the original story in headline,
first and second paragraphs.)  Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) ,
the state-run power utility known as Eletrobras, may see revenue
decline by as much as 8 billion reais annually because of
changes to government concessions in the energy sector, Reuters
reported on its website.  Eletrobras will compensate by reducing costs and overhead
and through payments from the government for investments that
havenâ€™t been amortized, Reuters reported, citing Chief Executive
Officer Jose da Costa Carvalho Neto, who spoke at an event in
 Sao Paulo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
