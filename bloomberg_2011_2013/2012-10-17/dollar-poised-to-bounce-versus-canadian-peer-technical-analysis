The  U.S. dollar  may rally against
its Canadian counterpart this week if it fails to break a trend
line at 97.40 cents, according to FX360.com, a foreign-exchange
research and analysis website.  “That’s going to be the key thing to watch for the next
eight to 24 hours -- whether we can hold that trend line or
not,” Matthew Weller, technical analyst at FX360.com, said in a
phone interview. “If we do start to see some signs of a bottom,
start to see maybe the dollar-CAD get back above 98 soon, the
thesis for a bounce would still be intact.”  The U.S. currency is consolidating just below the 97.80
level, he said. Investors should buy the greenback if it rises
above 98.15, Weller said, with a target of 98.60. A slide to
97.35 is likely if 97.70 is broken, he said.  The U.S. dollar traded below its 50-day moving average on
Oct. 16 and yesterday while trading above its 100- and 200-day
moving averages.  The U.S. currency declined 0.9 percent to 97.79 Canadian
cents yesterday, the biggest decrease on a closing basis in more
than a month. It rose 0.6 percent on Oct. 16, the most in almost
three months. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0224.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
