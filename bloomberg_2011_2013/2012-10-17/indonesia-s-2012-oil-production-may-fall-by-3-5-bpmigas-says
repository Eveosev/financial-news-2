Indonesia’s crude and condensate
output may fall 3.5 percent this year because of problems
including unplanned shutdowns and reduced production in older
 oil fields .  Indonesia may pump an average 870,000 barrels a day of
crude and condensate, down from 902,000 barrels in 2011, R.
Priyono, head of the nation’s oil and gas regulator BPMigas,
said in a meeting with parliament in Jakarta today. Production
may recover to 900,000 barrels a day next year, he said.  “As major oil fields are yet to be discovered, we are in
the period of declining production,” Priyono said. The nation
is relying on the Cepu block, which is operated by Exxon Mobil
Corp., to lift output to exceed 1 million barrels, he said.  The nation withdrew from the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries in 2008 amid falling petroleum shipments
after output from older fields declined.  Indonesia ’s natural gas output may rise to 8,690 million
cubic feet a day in 2013 from an estimated 8,412 this year as
some gas fields will start operations, Priyono said.  BPMigas targets $34.46 billion of oil and gas revenue this
year, more than the state budget target of $33.5 billion because
of higher prices, Priyono said. Indonesia’s crude stockpiles
amount to 11 million barrels, including 5 million barrels which
are ready to be sold, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
