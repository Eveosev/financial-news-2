Michael Corbat , who was named chief
executive officer of Citigroup Inc. yesterday, said he is likely
to update employees today about any preliminary changes in
management.  “We’ll send out a note probably later today detailing an
interim reporting structure,” Corbat said on a conference call
with the New York-based bank’s managing directors. Dow Jones
reported the remark earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
