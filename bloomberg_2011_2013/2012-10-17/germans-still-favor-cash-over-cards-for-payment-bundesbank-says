Cash remains Germansâ€™ preferred
method of payment, according to a Bundesbank study.  More than half of all purchases, 53 percent, are paid for
in cash, followed by debit cards at 28 percent and credit cards
with 7 percent, the Frankfurt-based Bundesbank said today. A
similar survey carried out four years ago found that 58 percent
of all transactions were settled in cash and 25.5 percent by
debit cards, the Bundesbank said.  Germans on average carry 103 euros ($135) in cash on their
person, down from 118 euros in 2008, the study found.  To contact the reporter on this story:
