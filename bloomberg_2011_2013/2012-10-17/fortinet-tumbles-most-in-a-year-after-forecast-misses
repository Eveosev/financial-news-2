Fortinet Inc. (FTNT) , a provider of
computer-network security, fell the most in more than a year
after narrowing its annual forecast and predicting fourth-
quarter results that trailed analysts’ estimates.  The shares tumbled 19 percent to $20.14 at the close in New
York, for the biggest drop since July 2011. The stock has
declined 7.7 percent this year.  Fortinet, whose Chief Financial Officer  Ken Goldman  is
slated to take the same role at  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  on Oct. 22,
yesterday forecast fourth-quarter earnings and sales that
trailed analysts’ estimates after citing weaker results from
 China  in the third quarter. The Sunnyvale, California-based
company reported billings for last quarter that declined from
the prior period.  “We were expecting stronger performance from China,”
Goldman said on an analyst call. “The volatility we often face
in that market was accentuated by a reliance on large deals.”  The company has taken steps to “enhance our channel and
management of sales teams and expect performance there to
improve over time,” Goldman said.  Fourth-quarter earnings will be about 15 cents per share,
the company said on the call. That trailed an average estimate
of 16 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue
for the period will be $142 million to $146 million. Analysts
had projected $146.3 million.  Full-year sales will be $524 million to $528 million, the
company said on the call. Fortinet had  previously  projected
sales of $525 million to $530 million.  Billings for the third quarter were $145 million, from
$145.8 million in the second quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
