Crude oil options volatility
declined as underlying futures changed by less than 25 cents for
a fourth day, the longest string of such moves since 2003.  Implied volatility for options expiring in December, a
measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, was 29.43 percent at 4:20 p.m. in New York, down
from 30.84 yesterday. November options expired today.  Crude oil for December delivery rose 5 cents to settle at
$92.59 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while the
November contract gained 3 cents to $92.12. The settlement price
for front-month futures has changed less than 25 cents for four
consecutive days, the first time thatâ€™s happened since October
2003, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
December $85 puts, which dropped 12 cents to 74 cents a barrel
at 4:26 p.m. with 2,424 lots trading. November $92 puts were the
second-most active, with 2,356 lots exchanged as they declined
57 cents a barrel to 8 cents.  Bearish bets accounted for 60 percent of the 55,040
contracts in electronic trading. One contract covers 1,000
barrels of oil.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bets that prices would fall made
up 73 percent of the 134,331 contracts traded.  January $60 puts were the most actively traded options
yesterday with 35,038 lots changing hands. They fell 4 cents to
6 cents a barrel. November $90 puts declined 17 cents to 10
cents on volume of 5,412.  Open interest was highest for December $120 calls with
67,839 contracts. Next were December $80 puts with 51,604 lots
and December $125 calls with 45,418.  To contact the reporters on this story:
