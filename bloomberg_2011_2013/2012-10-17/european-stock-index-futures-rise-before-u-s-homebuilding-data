European stock-index futures gained
before a report that may show American new-home construction
climbed to the highest level in four years. Asian shares rallied
while U.S. futures were little changed.  Futures on the  Euro Stoxx 50 Index (SX5E) , a benchmark for the
euro region, increased 0.4 percent to 2,551 at 7:06 a.m. in
 London . Contracts on the U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index rose less than
0.1 percent. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures slipped 0.1
percent, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index jumped 1 percent.  New-home construction in the U.S. probably rose in
September to the highest level in four years, economists said
before a report today. Builders broke ground on 770,000 houses
at an annual rate, up from 750,000 starts in August and the most
since October 2008, according to the median estimate of 80
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
