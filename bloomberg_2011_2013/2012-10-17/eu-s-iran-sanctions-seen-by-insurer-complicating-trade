Following are comments by the
Standard Club, a provider of marine insurance, on the impact of
new European Union sanctions against  Iran  approved this week.  The club commented in a  statement  on its website today.  “These regulations will make it more difficult for EU
entities and individuals to do business with the listed
entities. The practicalities of the prohibitions against the
transport/supply of certain goods will become clearer with the
anticipated publication of implementing regulation (s).  ‘‘However, members should take stock of any trade with
Iran/Iranian entities and consider in particular whether any
cargoes may have dual uses. Members should also ensure that any
cargoes destined for Iran are fully and accurately described in
any contracts of carriage and that appropriate due diligence is
carried out in relation to all contractual partners.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
