UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH)  raised $2.5
billion in a four-part, dollar-denominated debt offering to help
finance the biggest U.S. health insurer’s plan to buy 90 percent
of  Amil Participacoes SA. (AMIL3)   UnitedHealth sold equal $625 million portions of 0.85
percent, three-year notes that yield 45 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, 1.4 percent, five-year debt with a
65 basis-point spread, 2.75 percent bonds due in February 2023
that pay 95 basis points more than benchmarks and 3.95 percent,
30-year securities with an extra yield of 110 basis points,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Proceeds will fund a portion of the $4.9 billion
acquisition price, Minnetonka, Minnesota-based UnitedHealth said
today in a regulatory filing. The company’s $1.1 billion of
2.875 percent notes maturing in March 2022 traded at 103 cents
on the dollar on Oct. 12 to yield 2.5 percent with an 85 basis-
point spread over Treasuries, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Buying the Rio de Janeiro-based insurer and hospital chain
would give UnitedHealth a stake in the world’s second-biggest
emerging economy as U.S. insurers snap up smaller rivals while
preparing for tighter profit margins under President  Barack Obama ’s health-care overhaul.  The new bonds are expected to be rated A3 by Moody’s
Investors Service, which signals the debt is subject to low
credit risk, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
