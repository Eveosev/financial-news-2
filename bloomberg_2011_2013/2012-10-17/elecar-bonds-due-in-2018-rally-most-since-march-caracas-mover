Bonds sold by Venezuelan state-owned
utility  Electricidad de Caracas  rallied, pushing yields down the
most since March 19, as investors sought the highest yield in
 Venezuela .  Yields on the 8.5 percent bonds due in 2018 fell 53 basis
points, or 0.53 percentage point, to 14.76 percent at 3:19 p.m.
in Caracas, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bond’s
price rose 1.64 cent to 77.04 cents on the dollar.  “Elecar offers the highest yield in Venezuela and is the
farthest outlier on the Venezuela curve at over 14 percent,”
Russ Dallen, the head bond trader at Caracas  Capital Markets  in
Miami, said today in an e-mail. “It is being drawn back down
toward the curve.”  Elecar rose the most today among bonds issued by
Venezuela’s government and state oil company  Petroleos de
Venezuela SA  as investors turned to higher yielding assets, said
Dallen. The bonds, with $650 million outstanding, have returned
37.2 percent this year, outpacing the 31.5 percent return this
year for Venezuelan government dollar debt.  Electricidad de Caracas, which sold the bonds in 2008 after
being nationalized by the government in 2007, is rated B by
 Standard & Poor’s , compared to Venezuela’s B+ rating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
