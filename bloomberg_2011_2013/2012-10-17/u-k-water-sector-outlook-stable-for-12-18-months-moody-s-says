The U.K. water sector is stable and
likely to remain that way for 12 to 18 months, reflecting steady
operating performance and price increases sufficient to offset
rising costs, Moody’s Investors Service said today.  The industry outlook from analysts including Neil
Griffiths-Lambeth said investor interest in  England  and  Wales ’
water sector has remained strong though credit pressures will
build due to “a shifting regulatory landscape.”  A draft bill on planned regulatory and legal changes that
the report said was “short on detail” is due to be considered
by the U.K.’s Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select
Committee this fall and may go to Parliament for the next
legislative session, May 2013 to May 2014.  That may lead to “a tougher operating environment for
companies and a potential deterioration in the overall credit
quality of the water sector,” the analysts wrote. “However,
these changes will not take effect before the start of the next
regulatory period in April 2015 and competition will not come
quickly.”  The report made no mention of  United Utilities Group Plc (UU/)  or
other water companies receiving a takeover bid as has been
speculated in the U.K. press in recent months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
