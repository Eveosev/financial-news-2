Colombia ’s peso bond yields extended
their increase from a record low as legislation that would
reduce taxes foreigners pay on fixed-income investments awaited
approval by Congress.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso-denominated
bonds due in July 2024 rose for a second day, climbing two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.07 percent, according to
the central bank. It fell to 6.03 percent on Oct. 12, the lowest
level on a closing basis since the debt was first sold in 2009.
The price decreased 0.236 centavo to 132.288 centavos per peso.  “The rally went too far too soon, especially in the long
end” of the bond curve, said  Andres Pardo , the Bogota-based
head analyst at Corp. Financiera Colombiana SA, a financial
services holding company. “The bill hasn’t been approved yet.”  Legislation sent to Congress this month would reduce taxes
foreigners pay for profits on fixed-income investments to 12.5
percent from 33 percent. The bill includes government peso bonds
sold in the local market and corporate debt. Finance Minister
 Mauricio Cardenas  has said he hopes the legislation will be
approved by year-end.  The peso advanced 0.1 percent to 1,797.98 per  U.S. dollar ,
extending its rally this year to 7.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
