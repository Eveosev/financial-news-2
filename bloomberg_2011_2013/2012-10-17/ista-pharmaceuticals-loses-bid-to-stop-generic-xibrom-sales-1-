ISTA Pharmaceuticals Inc. has lost a
bid to stop sales of a generic version of its anti-inflammatory
eye drop Xibrom after a judge ruled July 9 the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration properly approved the copy sold by Coastal
Pharmaceuticals.  U.S. District Judge James Gwin rejected ISTA’s claim that
FDA’s approval of the generic copy was arbitrary and capricious
because Xibrom’s label wasn’t “currently approved” at the time
and therefore couldn’t serve as a reference drug. Gwin re-issued
the ruling today to amend the original decision.  ISTA, based in  Irvine ,  California , sued the FDA last year
arguing that agency approval of twice-a-day Xibrom, a solution
used to reduce pain and inflammation following cataract surgery,
had expired once the FDA approved a labeling change for the
product.  The case is ISTA Pharmaceuticals v. Food and Drug
Administration, 11-cv-0907, U.S. District Court,  District of
Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
