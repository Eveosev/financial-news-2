Wheat rose in  Chicago  as dry weather
in  Australia  added to global supply concerns after the worst
U.S. drought in half a century parched crops. Corn gained.  Wheat reserves in Australia, the second-largest exporter,
fell 14 percent from a year earlier at the marketing season’s
end on Sept. 30, the government said today. It expects
production of the grain to drop to 22.5 million metric tons this
year from the prior period’s record. Western Australia will
remain dry in the next seven days, increasing risks of winter-
crop damage, Telvent DTN Inc. said today.  “The dry weather in Australia is still a concern,” Victor Thianpiriya, an agricultural commodity analyst at  Australia &
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) , said by phone from Singapore.  Wheat for December delivery advanced 0.5 percent to $8.5225
a bushel by 6:56 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices slid
4.3 percent in the previous three days. In Paris, milling wheat
for November delivery rose 0.2 percent to 258 euros ($339) a ton
on NYSE Liffe.  Algeria  issued a tender to buy 50,000 tons of wheat, which
“held European wheat prices steady” before the results, French
farm adviser Offre &  Demande Agricole  wrote in an e-mailed
comment. “French wheat is in a good position and Algeria
usually buys much more than it initially sets out to buy.”  Corn for delivery in December rose 0.6 percent to $7.4275 a
bushel in Chicago. The grain has dropped 13 percent since
concerns about the U.S. drought lifted prices to a record $8.49
a bushel on Aug. 10.  Corn Premium  The  premium  companies pay for corn delivered to U.S. Gulf
export elevators was 65 cents a bushel yesterday, up from 37
cents on Aug. 31, before the current marketing year began, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show. About 79 percent of the
U.S. corn crop was  collected  as of Oct. 14, the USDA said the
next day. The harvest was forecast to  shrink  to the smallest
since the 2006-07 season because of the drought, the USDA said
Oct. 11.  “The cash market for corn in the U.S. interior is still
tight,” ANZ’s Thianpiriya said. “The market is still trying to
find the right price to ration demand.”  Soybeans for delivery in November were little changed at
$14.935 a bushel.  To contact the reporters on this story:
