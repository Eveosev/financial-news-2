Nigeria ’s naira declined after the
country’s inflation slowed to a nine-month low and on
speculation importers demanded more dollars for transactions.  The currency of  Africa ’s largest oil producer slipped 0.2
percent to 157.525 per dollar as of 1:48 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital. The naira has increased 3 percent this year,
after reaching a record low of 165.25 in December, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nigeria relies on imports to meet 70 percent of its fuel
needs because of inadequate refining capacity, according to the
Petroleum Ministry. The inflation rate fell to 11.3 percent in
September, from 11.7 percent in August, the Abuja-based
statistics agency said. The  Central Bank of Nigeria , led by
Governor Lamido Sanusi, has left its benchmark interest rate
unchanged at a record 12 percent this year to help support the
naira. The bank’s goal is to bring the inflation rate down to
less than 10 percent.  “Despite the fall in  core inflation , which is mostly the
result of base effects, we view that the CBN will keep monetary
policy tight over the near-term, with  interest rates  firmly on
hold for the remainder of the year,” Thalma Corbett, chief
economist at Paarl, South Africa-based NKC Independent
Economists, wrote in an e-mailed note today. “Cutting rates too
soon could undermine the stability of the naira and hence fuel
inflationary pressures again.”  Yields on Nigeria’s 16.39 percent debt maturing January
2022 rose five basis points to 13.67 percent, according to
yesterday’s data on the  Financial Markets Dealers Association 
website. The yield on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due
January 2021 were little changed at 4.675 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi strengthened less than 0.1 percent to 1.8865 a
dollar in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
