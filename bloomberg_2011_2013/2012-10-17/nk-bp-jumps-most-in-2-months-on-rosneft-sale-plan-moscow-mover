OAO  TNK-BP Holding (TNBP)  surged the most
in eight weeks on speculation  BP Plc (BP/) ’s billionaire partners plan
to sell their stake in the company to OAO Rosneft.  TNK-BP Holding, the traded unit of BP’s Russian venture,
jumped as much as 4.5 percent before finishing 3.8 percent
higher at 82.96 rubles by the close in Moscow, the biggest gain
since Aug. 22.  The billionaires, represented by the AAR group, are looking
to sell their 50 percent holding to Rosneft for $28 billion, one
person, who declined to be identified before a deal is
completed, said. Officials from AAR, Rosneft and BP declined to
comment.  “Speculators are buying up the stock hoping for a premium
sale payout,” Sergey Vakhrameev, a senior analyst at IFC
Metropol in Moscow, said by phone.  President  Vladimir Putin  has used Rosneft to consolidate
the government’s grip on  Russia ’s energy industry. Headed by
 Igor Sechin , a Putin associate for more 20 years and former
deputy prime minister, the Moscow-based company would produce
more than 3.5 million barrels a day of oil and gas should the
deal with AAR go ahead.  BP shares surged as much as 4.3 percent in  London  and
closed 3 percent higher at 448.35 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
