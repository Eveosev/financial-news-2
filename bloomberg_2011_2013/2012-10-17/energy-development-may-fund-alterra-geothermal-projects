Energy Development Corp. (EDC) , the
largest Philippine geothermal company, may form a joint venture
to fund as many as six South American projects being developed
by  Alterra Power Corp. (AXY)   Under an agreement announced today, Energy Development
would get a 70 percent stake in the venture if it provides $58.3
million to develop Alterra’s Mariposa project in Chile or $8
million for five Peruvian concessions, Anders Kruus, a spokesman
for Vancouver-based Alterra, said in a phone interview.  Energy Development, based in Pasig, Philippines, will carry
out due diligence and decide within six months whether to
proceed with the deal, Alterra said in a statement. Energy
Development, controlled by Red Vulcan Holdings Corp., was
founded in 1976 as part of the Philippine National Oil Co.,
according to its website.  Geothermal power plants produce electricity by tapping
underground pockets of steam or thermal fluid. Alterra has
several early-stage geothermal projects in the southern volcanic
belt of  Peru  and the Mariposa project has an “inferred resource
estimate” of 320 megawatts of generating capacity, Kruus said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
