Kevin Love  of the Minnesota
Timberwolves broke two bones in his right hand yesterday during
a workout, forcing him out for six to eight weeks.  All-Star forward Love averaged 26 points and 13.3 rebounds
a game for the Timberwolves last season and led the National
Basketball Association by reaching double figures in both points
and rebounds in 48 games.  “You hate to lose anybody, but certainly Kevin, who has
been our leading scorer and rebounder,” Timberwolves owner Glen
Taylor said, according to the team’s website. “My hope is the
coach working with these players will make something positive
out of it and a couple guys will step up. Then we’ll be better
prepared for the future.”  The Timberwolves open the regular season on Nov. 2 against
the  Sacramento Kings , so Love, 24, will probably miss at least
the first 14 games.  The 6-foot-10 Love has averaged 17.3 points and 12 rebounds
over four NBA seasons. He led the league in rebounding during
the 2010-11 season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
