Egypt  launched a campaign to protect
women from sexual harassment by videotaping attackers and
broadcasting the images, state-run Middle East  News Agency  said.  Cameras will be sited in major squares and streets to
capture images of men harassing women, MENA reported today,
citing the  Interior Ministry .  Sexual harassment is one the most common problems facing
girls and women in Egyptâ€™s streets and public places.  The National Council for Women is preparing a full anti-
harassment campaign with help from the Interior Ministry, and
had suggested harsher penalties for such offenses, MENA said,
citing the council. The project would be finalized before the
Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha. The festival often witnesses the
highest rates and worst cases of sexual harassment, said Mervat
El-Talawy, the council chairwoman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
