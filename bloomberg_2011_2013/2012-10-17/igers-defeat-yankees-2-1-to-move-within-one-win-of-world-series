The Detroit Tigers defeated the New
York Yankees 2-1 to move within one win of the  World Series .  The Tigers lead the Yankees by three games to none in the
American League Championship Series and can close the best-of-
seven contest with a home win tomorrow.  The 2004 Boston Red Sox are the only team to rally from a
3-0 deficit to win a Major League Baseball playoff series.  The Yankees won a record-extending 27th World Series in
2009, while the Tigers are chasing a fifth title and first since
1984.  The National League Championship Series resumes tomorrow in
 St. Louis  with the Cardinals and San Francisco Giants tied at a
game apiece.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
