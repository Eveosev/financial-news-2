M&T Bank Corp., the lender that
counts  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. among its
largest shareholders, rose the most in almost a year after
posting a third-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates.  M&T climbed 6.4 percent to $103.57 at 9:49 a.m. in New
York, the most since November. Shares advanced 28 percent this
year through yesterday, matching the gains of the  24-company KBW
Bank Index. (BKX)   Net income rose 60 percent to $293 million, or $2.17 a
share, compared with $183 million, or $1.32, a year earlier, the
Buffalo, New York-based lender said today in a statement.
Excluding merger-related costs and other non-operating expenses,
profit was $2.24 cents a share, beating by 38 cents the  average
estimate  of 26 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Loan growth, wider margins, prudent expense management
and continuing improvement in  credit quality  combined for an
impressive quarter,” Chief Financial Officer Rene F. Jones said
in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
