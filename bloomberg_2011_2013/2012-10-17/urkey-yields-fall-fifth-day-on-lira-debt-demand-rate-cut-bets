The Turkish lira declined for the
first time in three days against the dollar on speculation the
central bank will cut its overnight lending rate today. Bonds
fell for the first time in six days.  The lira weakened 0.2 percent against dollar to 1.8020 at
11:21 a.m. in Istanbul, and dropped 0.1 percent against euro to
2.36. Yields on two-year benchmark debt rose 3 basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 7.35 percent.  The central bank will cut the upper end of its so-called
interest-rate corridor by 50 basis points to 9.5 percent to
support the economy, according to the  median estimate  of eight
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Governor Erdem Basci
introduced the rates band in October 2011 to rein in credit
growth and control inflation.  “People have started to talk more loudly of a shock cut
from the central bank in the last a few days,” Cem Tozge, a
fund manager at Ata Invest in Istanbul, said by telephone. “A
50 basis point cut is more probable but we don’t rule out a 100
basis-point cut.” A 1 percentage point cut may send the lira to
1.83 against dollar, he said.  Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc., Sekerbank TAS and Yatirim
Finansman forecast a reduction in the overnight rate to 9.5
percent, while BNP Paribas SA and JPMorgan Chase & Co. predict a
cut to 9 percent, according to the Bloomberg survey. ING Groep
NV estimates the rate will be left unchanged. All forecast the
benchmark repurchase rate will be unchanged at 5.75 percent.  Reports in the past month showed growth in  gross domestic
product  slowed to 2.9 percent in the second quarter from 9.1
percent a year earlier.  Industrial output  shrank in August for
the first time since 2009 and the  current-account deficit 
narrowed for the 10th straight month to a three-year low,
according to separate data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
