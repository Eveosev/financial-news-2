Michael Corbat , who replaced  Vikram Pandit  as  Citigroup Inc. (C)  Chief Executive Officer yesterday,
named Bill Mills the interim head of the Europe, Middle East and
Africa unit that Corbat ran.  Japanese operations will report on an interim basis to
Eugene McQuade, 63, head of the Citibank N.A. unit, according to
a staff memo from Corbat today. All other executives who
reported to Pandit and former Chief Operating Officer John Havens will report to Corbat, according to the memo.  Corbat, who previously headed the EMEA unit, is reviewing
the management of New York-based Citigroup as he takes over the
lender after directors ousted Pandit yesterday. The lender
employs 262,000 people and is the third-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, with operations in more than 100 countries.  “I am going to take the next several weeks to immerse
myself in the businesses and the budget process as well as
review reporting structures,” Corbat said in the memo.  Executives who will report to Corbat, 52, include the head
of trading and  investment banking , Jamie Forese, 49, consumer-
banking chief Manuel Medina-Mora, 62, and chief risk officer
Brian Leach. Mills is 57.  To contact the reporter on this story:
