Oil was little changed as U.S. new-
home construction rose and crude supplies climbed to the most
for this time of year since government records began in 1982.  Futures gained 3 cents as housing starts surged in
September to the highest level in four years. U.S. oil demand
increased the most in two months last week, an Energy Department
report showed. Oil fell in intraday trading as the report also
said  inventories  jumped with output.  “The  U.S. economy  is modestly growing and the numbers
coming out indicate that,” said Marshall Berol, co-portfolio
manager of the Encompass Fund in  San Francisco , which has about
$300 million in assets. “There is good supply out there, but
there is also decent demand and it’s holding futures prices in a
pretty narrow range.”  Crude oil for November delivery rose for a second day to
settle at $92.12 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Futures have gained 6.7 percent in the past year.  Prices changed less than 25 cents for a fourth consecutive
day, the longest streak of moves that small since 2003. Implied
volatility for at-the-money options expiring in December, a
measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, was 29.4 percent at 3:20 p.m. in New York, the
lowest level in two months.  Brent for December settlement fell 78 cents, or 0.7
percent, to end the session at $113.22 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures  Europe . November futures expired yesterday.  Housing Starts  U.S. housing starts jumped 15 percent last month to an
872,000 annual rate, the most since July 2008, the Commerce
Department said. Starts exceeded all forecasts in a Bloomberg
survey of economists that ranged from 735,000 to 800,000.
 Building permits , a proxy for future construction, jumped to the
most since July 2008.  Total petroleum  demand  gained 4.3 percent, the biggest
single-week gain in two months, to 19.5 million barrels a day,
the Energy Department said in the weekly report. Consumption of
gasoline increased 1.7 percent to 8.73 million barrels a day.  Oil also rose as the euro strengthened to a one-month high
against the dollar after  Spain  kept its investment-grade  credit
rating  from Moody’s Investors Service, spurring a rally in
Spanish and Italian bonds.  “The housing number is supportive,” said  Gene McGillian ,
an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut . “The dollar-to-oil connection has been strong.”  The 17-nation European currency appreciated as much as 0.7
percent to $1.314, the highest level since Sept. 17. A stronger
euro and weaker dollar increase oil’s appeal as an investment
alternative.  U.S. Inventories  Oil fell as much as 0.6 percent in intraday trading after
the Energy Department report showed U.S. stockpiles grew 2.86
million barrels in the seven days ended Oct. 12 to 369.2
million, more than the 1.5 million-barrel median estimate by
analysts polled by Bloomberg.  “There is a lot of crude out there, and it’s pushing
prices lower,” said  Kyle Cooper , director of commodities
research at IAF Advisors in Houston. “Supply is not tight and
prices are on the upper end of the range.”  U.S.  production  increased for a sixth week to 6.61 million
barrels a day, the department said. That’s the highest level
since May 1995. Oil imports grew for a third week, up 126,000
barrels a day to 8.35 million.  ‘Major Headwinds’  “Oil should be a lot lower based on these figures today,”
said Rich Ilczyszyn, chief market strategist and founder of
Iitrader.com in  Chicago . “Oil is stuck in this range of $91 to
$93. It’s having major headwinds anywhere between $93 to $100.”  The report also showed gasoline  inventories  climbed 1.72
million barrels to 197.1 million last week. They were expected
to increase 500,000 barrels.  Gasoline futures for November delivery slumped 6.36 cents,
or 2.2 percent, to $2.7817 a gallon on the Nymex, the lowest
settlement since July 11.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 500,679
contracts as of 4:02 p.m. Volume totaled 531,339 contracts
yesterday, 0.6 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.58 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
