Mexico ’s peso rebounded from its
first loss in four days as a surge in U.S. new-home construction
boosted the economic outlook for the Latin American country’s
biggest trading partner.  The currency gained 0.4 percent to 12.7875 per  U.S. dollar 
at 4 p.m. in Mexico City. The peso’s 9 percent rally in 2012 is
the biggest among the dollar’s 16 most-traded counterparts
tracked by Bloomberg.  Housing starts in the U.S. jumped in September to the
highest level in four years, Commerce Department data showed
today. Mexico depends on exports for about 30 percent of its
gross domestic product, sending almost 80 percent of them to its
northern neighbor.  “The data came out well,” Roberto Galvan, a currency
trader at Intercam Casa de Bolsa SA, said by phone from Mexico
City. “The measure that liquidity is flowing through U.S.
businesses shows that Mexican businesses are going to have
better sales.”  Starts jumped 15 percent to an 872,000 annual rate last
month, the most since July 2008 and exceeding all forecasts in a
Bloomberg survey of economists, the data showed. The median
estimate of 81 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for
770,000.  Optimism about the  U.S. economy  is mounting after reports
also showed this week that industrial production and retail
sales gained more than forecast last month.  Mexican fixed-rate, local-currency bonds had their fourth
straight day of declines, following U.S. Treasuries lower, as
the data is reducing demand for assets seen as a refuge.  Yields on Mexico’s peso bonds due in 2024 rose six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 5.5 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.65 centavo to
139.81 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
