Palm oil  gained on speculation that
India, the largest consumer, is buying before the festival
season this month and November.  The contract for January delivery, which has the largest
open interest and volume, rose 0.2 percent to close at 2,471
ringgit ($815) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange. The most-active contract has lost 22 percent this
year, touching a three-year low this month, as demand slowed and
reserves rose.  The world’s second-most populous country celebrates several
religious festivals in October and Diwali in November. Dorab Mistry, a director of Godrej International Ltd., told a
conference in Kuala Lumpur yesterday that futures may drop to
2,200 ringgit, the lowest level since November 2009, in the next
six weeks as crude oil drops amid a global slowdown.  “There should be some restocking from  India  ahead of the
festival season,” said James Ratnam, an analyst at TA
Securities Holdings Bhd. “However, taking into account
yesterday’s bearish views at the conference, I don’t think there
will be any sustained interest on the upside for today.”  Reserves increased to a record 2.48 million tons last
month, data from the Malaysian Palm Oil Board show. Mistry
forecast a further increase to 3 million tons or more on Jan. 1.  India’s  crude palm oil imports  climbed 32 percent to
722,754 tons in September, while refined purchases fell 22
percent to 111,163 tons, the  Solvent Extractors’ Association of
India  said Oct. 15.  Soybean oil  for December delivery advanced 0.4 percent to
50.69 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for
November delivery were little changed at $14.955 a bushel.  Palm oil for January delivery lost 0.6 percent to close at
6,884  yuan  ($1,101) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
Soybean oil for delivery in May dropped 0.3 percent to end at
9,188 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
