Serbia’s current-account deficit
widened in the first eight months of the year as foreign
investments and capital inflows were insufficient to cover the
widening foreign trade gap.  The shortfall grew 34 percent from a year earlier to 2.2
billion euros ($2.9 billion), the Belgrade-based Narodna Banka
Srbije said on its website today. The monthly gap rose 2.9
percent to 136 million euros.  The trade deficit expanded 14 percent from a year ago to
3.67 billion euros as export growth slowed to 0.8 percent
because of weak demand for Serbian goods and services in the
crisis-hit European Union, the Balkan nation’s main export
market.  Remittances dropped 8.5 percent through August to 1.34
billion euros and foreign direct investment remained negative
for an eighth month, the bank said. Portfolio investment fell to
74.1 million euros, compared with 904.5 million euros for the
January-August period last year.  The central bank sees the full-year current-account gap at
3.1 billion euros, or 10.7 percent of gross domestic product.  To contact the reporter on this story:
