The most violent mining strikes in
 South Africa  since the end of apartheid are hobbling an economy
that’s faced with a 25 percent  jobless rate  and threatened by
further credit rating downgrades.  Growth in Africa’s largest economy will ease to 2.3 percent
this year, the slowest pace since a 2009 recession, according to
the median estimate of eight economists surveyed by Bloomberg
this week. That’s down from 2.5 percent before the mining
strikes began in August and 3.1 percent in 2011. The estimates
range from 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent.  Illegal strikes that spread from  Lonmin Plc (LMI) ’s Marikana mine
in August prompted  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS)  to fire 12,000
workers on Oct. 5.  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)  said 11,000 workers returned
to work today and 1,500 who didn’t will be fired. That may put
President  Jacob Zuma ’s pledge of slashing the jobless rate to 14
percent by 2020 out of reach.  “A meaningful amount of jobs” may be lost in the next
year,  Mike Schussler , chief economist at independent research
group Economists.co.za, said in a phone interview from
Johannesburg. “To carry on like this, we are destroying the
future of our country.”  Schussler estimates the  unemployment rate , which is already
the highest of more than 60 nations tracked by Bloomberg, will
exceed 25 percent for the next two to three years. The economy
may lose about 85,000 jobs this year, Michael Kafe, an economist
at Morgan Stanley in Johannesburg, said in a note to clients on
Oct. 15.  Rand Slumps  Investor confidence has been shaken by the strikes, which
left at least 46 people dead at Lonmin’s Marikana mine,
including 34 protesters killed by police on Aug. 16. The rand
has slumped 4.8 percent against the dollar since then, the worst
performer of 25 emerging market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.
The currency dropped 0.3 percent to 8.629 per dollar at 6:19
p.m. in Johannesburg today.  Moody’s Investors Service and  Standard & Poor’s  lowered
South Africa’s credit rating in the past three weeks, citing
rising political risk, slower economic growth and a weakening in
government finances. They left the rating on a negative watch,
indicating the chance of further downgrades if economic
conditions don’t improve.  “In 30 years, we haven’t seen such a spread of wildcat
strikes in the mining sector,” Peter Major, head of mining at
Cadiz Corporate Solutions, said at a panel discussion hosted by
Bloomberg in  Cape Town  on Oct. 16. “It’s going to take a few
years for normality to return.”  Wage Boosts  Wage settlements above the 5 percent inflation rate are
boosting costs for mining companies, threatening jobs. Lonmin
ended the six-week strike at Marikana by giving workers pay
rises of as much as 22 percent.  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP) 
gave workers a second salary boost this year to bring the
average increase to 15 percent. The two companies employ about
60,000 workers in total.  Anglo American Platinum said today it will delay firing
striking workers at its Union and Amandelbult mines as it moves
salary talks forward. While the company won’t reinstate the
12,000 workers fired at the Rustenburg operation, it plans to
discuss this further with labor unions, Johannesburg-based Anglo
American Platinum said in a statement.  Manufacturing Shrinks  “If you assume some of the mining companies are going to
have to cut costs because of the longer-term effects of the
salary increases, it’s not unrealistic to estimate we could lose
between 55,000 and 70,000 jobs in the short to medium term,”
Claude Baissac, the founder of country-risk consultants Eunomix,
said in a phone interview from Johannesburg.”  The  Reserve Bank , led by Governor  Gill Marcus , already
lowered its growth forecast to 2.6 percent in September and may
review it again because of the strikes, Deputy Governor  Daniel Mminele  said in  Tokyo  on Oct. 14. Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  may adjust his 2.7 percent growth estimate in his mid-
term budget next week.  The labor unrest is putting pressure on an economy already
hit by falling manufacturing output as the debt crisis in Europe
curbs export demand.  Factory output , which makes up 15 percent
of the economy, contracted 1 percent in the second quarter,
while South Africa posted its biggest current-account deficit in
almost four years of 6.4 percent of gross domestic product in
the period.  The shortfall is undermining the rand and adding to
pressure on  inflation , making it more difficult for the central
bank to lower borrowing costs. The bank left its key rate
unchanged at 5 percent in September, after lowering it for the
first time in 20 months in July.  “It is difficult to see where the potential good news will
come from at this point,”  Razia Khan , head of Africa economic
research at Standard Chartered Plc in  London , said in a phone
interview. Aside from interest rate cuts “there is very little
else the authorities can do in terms of engineering some sort of
economic resurgence.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
