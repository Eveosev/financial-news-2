A group of lawmakers from the Czech
ruling coalition is against a compromise tax-increase proposal
presented by Premier Petr Necas, MF Dnes reported, citing deputy
Petr Tluchor.  Necas proposed raising only one of two sales-tax rates,
compared with the government’s original plan to increase both
rates by one percentage point to 15 percent and 21 percent,
respectively, the newspaper said.  Six lawmakers from Necas’s Civic  Democratic Party ,
including Tluchor, joined the opposition on Sept. 5 and voted
against a government bill that included the tax increases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
