(Corrects length conversion in third paragraph of story
originally published Sept. 4, 2012.)  Boeing Co. (BA)  said work has begun on
the new 787-9 jet, a stretched version of the 787-8 Dreamliner,
as  Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. (7012)  began installing door frames
in part of the fuselage.  Final assembly will be completed next year at Boeing’s main
wide-body jet plant in Everett,  Washington ,  Randy Tinseth , the
planemaker’s marketing chief, said in a blog post on the company
website. The first flight will be next year as well, and the
plane will be delivered to the first customer in 2014, Tinseth
wrote.  The 787-9 is 20 feet (6 meters) longer than the 787-8 and
will carry 16 percent more passengers as far as 8,500 nautical
miles (15,700 kilometers), he wrote. The 787-8, the first
version of the plane, carries as many as 250 people on routes of
up to 8,200 nautical miles.  The Dreamliner is the world’s first composite-plastic
airliner. It was 3 1/2 years late when it entered service last
year, after Boeing struggled with the new materials and
manufacturing processes it developed for the plane.  To contact the reporter on this story:
