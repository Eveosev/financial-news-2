Young U.S. voters support President
 Barack Obama  by a narrower margin than they did in the 2008
election and backers of Republican challenger  Mitt Romney  are
more enthusiastic about going to the polls, according to a poll
released today.  In a  survey  by Harvard University’s Institute of Politics
of likely voters under 30 years of age, Obama led Romney 55
percent to 36 percent. Exit polls of voters in the 2008 election
showed Obama defeating Republican Senator John McCain of  Arizona 
among those 18 to 29 years of age by 34 percentage points, a key
to the president’s victory.  Participants in the latest Harvard poll who were eligible
to vote four years ago backed Obama over McCain by a margin of
25 points, 58 percent to 33 percent.  The poll shows young Romney supporters are more
enthusiastic than those backing Obama. Sixty-five percent of
those who favored the former Massachusetts governor said they
will “definitely” vote in the Nov. 6 election, compared with
55 percent of the Obama supporters who said they would
“definitely” go to the polls.  Harvard’s poll of young voters in 2008 surveyed 18- to 24-
year-olds, and that slice of the electorate may be less engaged
this time. Those in that age group in the latest survey are less
likely to vote by 16 percentage points than four years ago.  ‘Broken’ Washington  “As enthusiasm for voting continues to slip among
America’s 18- to 29-year olds, the IOP’s latest poll shows a
clear sentiment by young adults that  Washington  is broken,”
Trey Grayson, director of the Institute of Politics, said in a
statement.  Voters under 30 trust Obama more than Romney on issues
including the economy, women’s and youth concerns, and foreign
policy, the poll shows.  Romney’s selection of Wisconsin Representative Paul Ryan,
42, as his running mate hurt more than helped the Republican
ticket among young voters, according to the survey. Nine percent
of respondents said Ryan made them “much more likely” to vote
for Romney, while 40 percent said the selection made them “much
less likely” to support him.  Harvard’s survey of 2,123 U.S. citizens who are 18 to 29
years old was conducted between Sept. 19 and Oct. 3 and has a
margin of error of plus or minus 2.1 percentage points. Obama,
51, and Romney, 65, squared off in their first debate Oct. 3 in
Denver, and dueled in their second debate last night in
Hempstead, New York. They are to meet for their final face-off
Oct. 22 in Boca Raton,  Florida .  To contact the reporter on this story:
