Stockland,  Australia ’s biggest
diversified property trust, sank by the most in more than two
months after forecasting a 10 percent decline in earnings per
share in the year ending June 30, and sluggish conditions in the
housing market.  Stockland  shares  fell 3.7 percent to A$3.42 at the close of
trading in Sydney, the most since Aug. 8. They’ve risen 7.2
percent this year,  compared  with a 12 percent gain in the
benchmark S&P/ASX 200  Index. (AS51)   Profit at the Sydney-based company’s residential business
will be A$50 million ($51.4 million) lower this year than last,
according to a regulatory filing of statements made at its
annual shareholder meeting. If conditions in Victoria state,
where profit per lot is typically higher than in other parts of
the country, don’t improve,  Stockland (SGP) ’s  earnings  per share could
be a further 5 percent lower, it said.  The forecast comes as the company continues its search for
a new managing director to replace Matthew Quinn, who will step
down in February. Stockland will maintain its 24 cent dividend
for the 12 months ending June 30. The payout will equate to
between 90 percent and 95 percent of underlying profit this
year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
