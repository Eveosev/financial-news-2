Danske Bank (DANSKE)  A/S’s hybrid core
capital note advanced to a 16-month high in Copenhagen after
Jyske Bank A/S said the paper offered better returns than
similar bonds issued by Nykredit A/S.  Danske Bank’s perpetual, euro-denominated 4.878 percent
note rose to 93.058, its highest since June 2011, outperforming
Nykredit’s perpetual, euro-denominated 9 percent bond.  Danske’s note “will not only give a higher yearly return
but will do so for a longer period of time,” Christian Hede, an
analyst at Silkeborg, Denmark-based Jyske Bank, said by phone.
Hede cut recommendations on Nykredit’s 9 percent bond to sell
from buy and Nykredit’s 4.901 percent note to hold from buy.  Record low yields on government and covered bonds have
prompted a hunt for riskier assets offering higher returns.
That’s helped turn around demand for hybrid debt, which had seen
an outflow of foreign interest earlier this year, Hede said. At
the same time, a slowdown in writedowns probably will boost
profits starting next year, particularly at Danske, he said.  “People are more certain that Danske Bank will be able to
make money in coming years,” Hede said. “The whole situation
with Eivind Kolding being the new chief executive officer and
coming up with a new strategy plan in October will also help the
price.”  Danske Bank is due to report third-quarter earnings on Oct.
