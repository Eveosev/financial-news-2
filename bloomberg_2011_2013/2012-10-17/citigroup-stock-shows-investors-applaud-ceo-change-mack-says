The jump in  Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s share
price shows investors were pleased with the board’s decision to
replace Chief Executive Officer Vikram Pandit, said  John Mack ,
the former chairman and CEO of  Morgan Stanley. (MS)   “There was a view clearly by shareholders that change was
a good thing,” Mack told Erik Schatzker and Stephanie Ruhle on
Bloomberg Television’s “Market Makers.” New York-based Citigroup
rose 59 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $37.25 yesterday and were up 
to $37.89 at 10:29 a.m. today in New York.  “Clearly there was unhappiness with the board,” Mack said
of Pandit’s departure. “At the end of the day, a CEO has to
have a close relationship with his board.” Pandit was replaced
by Michael Corbat, who previously led Citigroup’s business in
Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  Mack, who joined private-equity firm KKR & Co. as a senior
adviser in March, stepped down as chairman of Morgan Stanley at
the end of last year, two years after ceding the CEO role he
held at the Wall Street bank from 2005 to 2010 to James Gorman.  To contact the reporters on this story:
