TeliaSonera AB (TLSN) ,  Sweden ’s biggest
phone company, plans to cut 2,000 jobs after reporting third-
quarter earnings that missed analysts’ estimates as increased
competition caused slowing sales in the Nordic region.  The reductions, equivalent to 7 percent of the workforce,
are aimed at lowering costs by 2 billion kronor ($304 million)
in the next two years. Earnings excluding interest, taxes,
depreciation, amortization and one-time items dropped 6.3
percent to 9.26 billion kronor, the Stockholm-based company said
in a statement today. Analysts  predicted  9.42 billion kronor on
average in a Bloomberg survey.  TeliaSonera, which made more than 60 percent of its  revenue 
in Nordic countries last year, is facing slowing growth in its
home markets and increasing competition for mobile services.
Earnings are still bolstered by double-digit growth in the
Eurasia unit, which includes mobile operations in  Turkey ,  Russia 
and several former Soviet Union countries.  TeliaSonera must “speed up the implementation of a new,
sustainable business model to defend our revenues and deal with
the increasing challenges that this industry is facing,” Chief
Executive Officer Lars Nyberg said in the statement.  Efficient  Even before the job cuts unveiled today the Stockholm-based
carrier is one of the most efficient operators in  Europe . Its
reported  sales per employee  of $566,369 for 2011 is more than 60
percent higher than the $347,332 at German rival Deutsche
Telekom AG and almost 50 percent higher than the
$380,854 of sales for each worker at  France Telecom SA. (FTE)   The job cuts were “unexpected, but should be seen as a
positive” as it “increases chances of maintaining
profitability,” Lars Soederfjell, a Stockholm-based analyst at
Aalandsbanken, said in an e-mail.  Sales fell 3.2 percent to 25.8 billion kronor, compared
with an average estimate of 26.1 billion kronor. Net income
declined 1.2 percent to 4.8 billion kronor, or 1.11 kronor a
share, from 4.86 billion kronor, or 1.12 kronor, a year earlier.  The company maintained its 2012 earnings forecast, saying
adjusted Ebitda margin for the year will be about 35 percent.  TeliaSonera plans to reduce its 35.6 percent stake in OAO
MegaFon as part of the Russian mobile operator’s planned initial
public offering. MegaFon should trade at a fair value of about
$12 billion to $16 billion, analysts at banks involved in the
IPO said in notes to investors.  TeliaSonera shares, which have declined 3 percent this
year, traded 1.6 percent lower at 45.38 kronor at 9:25 a.m. in
 Stockholm .  To contact the reporter on this story:
