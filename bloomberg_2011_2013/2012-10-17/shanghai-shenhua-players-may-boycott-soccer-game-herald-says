Shanghai Shenhua, the Chinese soccer
team that signed  Didier Drogba  and  Nicolas Anelka , may see its
players boycott an upcoming match because of a dispute over
unpaid wages, the Xiaoxiang Morning Herald reported today,
without citing anyone.  Players including Anelka boycotted a practice on Oct. 15 by
walking in street clothes around a track encircling the field
instead of training, the newspaper reported. Some players said
they won’t rule out boycotting Shenhua’s next match in the
Chinese Super League if they still aren’t paid, the report said.  The dispute comes as Shanghai Shenhua Chairman Zhu Jun’s
bid to become the club’s controlling shareholder has met with
opposition from other shareholders, the Xiaoxiang Morning Herald
reported. Shenhua is facing “difficulties” because “some
relationships” are not clear, the newspaper cited an
unidentified team official as saying when asked why player wages
haven’t been paid.  Zhu, the founder and chairman of online game developer  The9
Ltd. (NCTY) , has asked other shareholders to meet with him to discuss
his intentions, according to the newspaper. It’s possible that
Zhu may cut his investment in the club, according to the report.  In an interview with the official Xinhua News Agency, Sui
Guoyang, chairman of Shanghai’s soccer association, said Zhu
need greater “coordination and communication” with the club’s
other five shareholders.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
