Sales at major South Korean
department stores declined for the fourth straight month in
September as slowing economic growth weighed on confidence.  Outlays at the three biggest chains declined 0.8 percent
from a year earlier in September after a 6.9 percent drop in
August, the Ministry of  Knowledge Economy  said in a statement
today.  Discount-store sales  increased 0.2 percent last month,
the report showed.  Fewer purchases from consumers highlight slowing economic
activity that led the  Bank of Korea  to cut borrowing costs for
the second time this year on Oct. 11. The central bank lowered
its forecast for 2012 growth to 2.4 percent last week and will
report preliminary gross domestic product for the third quarter
on Oct. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
