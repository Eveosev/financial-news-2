Airbus SAS said it may surpass
 Boeing Co. (BA) , its only rival, in jetliner deliveries for the 10th
straight year even though the U.S. planemaker is ahead through
the third quarter and has a higher full-year forecast.  “Regarding deliveries, I think we are still ahead of
Boeing,” Airbus Chief Executive Officer Fabrice Bregier said in
an interview yesterday with Pimm Fox on Bloomberg Television’s
“Taking Stock” in  New York .  In the year through Sept. 30, Chicago-based Boeing had
handed over 436 aircraft to customers, compared with 405 by
Toulouse, France-based Airbus. Boeing has been forecasting 585
to 600 deliveries for the full year, against the target Airbus
has given for 570. Airbus, the civil aircraft unit of  European
Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. (EAD) , overtook Boeing in 2003 and has
held the top spot for annual deliveries since then.  “We might just beat Boeing” for 2012 deliveries, Mary Anne Greczyn, a spokeswoman for Airbus in  Washington , said in an
e-mail. “We’re looking good so far.”  A spokesman for Boeing wasn’t immediately available for
comment after business hours yesterday.  Both planemakers, whose duopoly is set to be challenged by
new competitors in Canada and  China , are building jets at record
rates and boosting production even higher to meet demand for
more fuel-efficient aircraft. Deliveries are key as that’s when
airlines make the final payments, which are usually a large
chunk of the purchase price.  Order Forecasts  While Boeing had about a 2-to-1 lead in orders through the
third quarter, Airbus expects to be ahead in the two years
through 2012, Bregier said. That period encompasses when both
companies began offering a revamped version of their single-
aisle jets, the most widely flown planes.  Airbus expects to have sold about 2,000 planes in 2011 and
2012 combined, Bregier said. The company began offering its
single-aisle A320neo in December 2010. It won total orders for
1,419 of all its planes last year and had sold 437 through
September this year, stripping out cancellations.  Boeing, which doesn’t give order forecasts, began offering
its 737 Max late last year. It had net orders for 805 jets in
2011 and for 879 through Oct. 2 this year.  “We will still lead this market,” Bregier said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
