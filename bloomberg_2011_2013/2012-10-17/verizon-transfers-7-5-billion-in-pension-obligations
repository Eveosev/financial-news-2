Verizon Communications Inc. will
transfer pension assets to Prudential to settle about $7.5
billion of its $30 billion in outstanding obligations.  The plan will purchase a group annuity contract from
 Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) , which will then assume the obligation
to make future annuity payments to certain Verizon management
retirees, according to a statement today.  With the agreement, Verizon expects to lower risks related
to the  pension plan  while improving its longer term financial
profile. The pension transfer won’t change the amount of the
monthly pension benefit received by affected retirees and
surviving beneficiaries, Verizon said.  The transaction affects U.S. management pension benefits
covering about 41,000 current management retirees. It excludes
current management employees and those who retired after Jan. 1,
2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
