Egypt â€™s decision to order shops and
cafes to close at 10 p.m. and midnight, respectively, will lead
to losses of 25 billion Egyptian pounds ($4.1 billion), Al-Ahram
said, citing the head of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce.  The move will also increase unemployment by 3 percent to 4
percent and affect tourism, the Cairo-based daily cited
Federation chief Ahmed El-Wakeel as saying. The order was
announced last week to curb electricity consumption in the
nation, the paper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
