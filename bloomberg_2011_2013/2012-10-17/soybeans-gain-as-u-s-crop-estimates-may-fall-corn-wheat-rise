Soybeans advanced for a second
straight day on speculation that the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  won’t raise its domestic  production  estimate again
as the harvest nears completion. Corn and wheat also climbed.  Farmers will collect 2.86 billion bushels of soybeans, the
fewest since 2008, the USDA estimated on Oct. 11. While the
projection was 8.6 percent more than a month earlier, the
department probably will lower or leave its forecast unchanged
in next month’s report because farmers are getting smaller
yields, said Jason Britt, the president of Central States
Commodities Inc.  “The USDA said we just increased production, but guys are
saying we didn’t gain a bushel,” Britt said by telephone from
 Kansas City ,  Missouri . “The harvest is so far along, and I
don’t see any big revisions.”  Soybean futures for November delivery gained 1 percent to
settle at $15.0925 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade. The price has climbed 25 percent in 2012 as the worst
U.S. drought since 1956 curbed production. The USDA will update
its global crop outlook on Nov. 9.  Corn futures for December delivery rose 1 percent to $7.455
a bushel in Chicago. The most-active contract is up 15 percent
this year because of dry weather.  Wheat futures for December delivery advanced 1 percent to
$8.5625 a bushel on the CBOT. The grain has surged 31 percent
this year as dry weather in Russia and  Australia  cut world
production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
