China’s stocks  rose, sending the
benchmark index up by most in a week, on speculation the economy
is stabilizing before the release of a government report
tomorrow on third-quarter growth.  Anhui Conch Cement Co. (600585)  led a gauge of industrial stocks
higher after Credit Suisse Group AG said the worst is probably
over based on data such as housing starts and manufacturing
indexes. Fortress Investment Group LLC turned bullish on  China ’s
yuan and equities on the prospect of pro-growth measures after
the Communist Party congress in November. GF Securities Co.
advanced 1 percent after the China Securities Journal reported
regulators may allow brokerages to expand their business scope.  China’s “growth is continuing and doing very well,”  Mark Mobius , executive chairman of the Templeton  Emerging Markets 
Group,  said in a Bloomberg Television interview today from  Hong
Kong . Mobius said he’s buying consumer stocks and considers
smaller companies to be cheap.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  added 0.3 percent to 2,105.62
at the close, erasing a 0.5 percent loss. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  rose
0.1 percent to 2,300.80. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) 
of Chinese companies traded in Hong Kong climbed 1.1 percent.
The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-traded
U.S.-listed Chinese companies, gained 0.7 percent in  New York 
yesterday.  The Shanghai Composite has rebounded 5.1 percent since
reaching a three-year low on Sept. 26 on expectations regulators
will introduce measures to stabilize the market ahead of a once-
in-a-decade power transition of the Communist Party in November.
The gauge is valued at 9.8 times estimated earnings, compared
with the 17.9 average since Bloomberg began compiling the weekly
 data  in 2006.  GDP Report  The National Bureau of Statistics is scheduled to release
third-quarter gross domestic product data tomorrow. The  economy 
probably expanded 7.4 percent, the slowest pace in more than
three years, according to the median estimate of 43 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Industrial production, fixed-asset
investment and retail sales data are also due the same day.  Anhui Conch, China’s biggest cement maker, rose 1.5 percent
to 16.14  yuan .  Gansu Qilianshan Cement Group Co. (600720)  gained 1.8
percent to 10.73 yuan. SAIC Motor Corp., China’s largest
carmaker, added 1.3 percent to 13.01 yuan.  China’s worst is probably over as infrastructure
investment, housing starts, retail sales, manufacturing indexes
and construction machinery sales all indicate the economy is
stabilizing, Vincent Chan and Peggy Chan, analysts at Credit
Suisse, wrote in a report dated yesterday.  Turn Bullish  Fortress turned bullish on the yuan and Chinese equities,
after betting on declines earlier in the year, as it predicts
the government will arrest a seven-quarter slowdown in the
world’s second-largest economy.  China showed signs of “stabilization and modest
improvement” last month and pro-growth measures are likely once
the nation’s new leadership is appointed in November, Adam Levinson, chief executive officer of the hedge fund’s Singapore
unit and manager of its Asia Macro Fund, said in an interview
yesterday.  Fortress (FIG)  manages $47.8 billion of assets globally.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398)  Ltd., the nation’s
biggest listed lender, rose 0.8 percent to 3.85 yuan.  Shanghai
Pudong Development Bank Co. (600000)  gained 1.2 percent to 7.55 yuan.
Ping An Bank Co. added 1.1 percent to 13.36 yuan.  Credit Suisse raised its recommendation on Chinese banks to
overweight from market weight, citing signs the Chinese economy 
is bottoming.  GF Securities, the third-largest listed brokerage by market
value, added 1 percent to 13.63 yuan. Industrial Securities Co.
advanced 2.7 percent to 10.65 yuan.  Profit Drop  Innovation policies will include relaxing limits on
brokerages’ operations and investment methods, accelerating new
product launches and supporting cross border operations and
brokerages’ listing, the China Securities Journal reported.  China’s publicly traded non-financial companies’ profits
for the first nine months probably dropped 17 percent from the
year-earlier period, almost unchanged from the first half,  Li Peng , Huang Xindong and Chen Jianxiang, analysts at Shenyin &
Wanguo Securities Co., wrote in a report today.  The Chinese currency touched 6.2525 per dollar in Shanghai
today, the strongest level since the government unified the
official and market exchange rates at the end of 1993. It has
advanced 2.3 percent from a 2012 low of 6.3967 on July 25.  Mitt Romney , neck-to-neck in polls with President  Barack Obama , reiterated today during their second debate he will
declare China a currency manipulator on his first day in the
White House, a precursor to import duties not taken since 1994.  Thirty-day  volatility  in the Shanghai Composite was at 19.6
today, compared with this year’s average of 17.2. About 5.9
billion shares changed hands in the gauge, 23 percent lower than
the daily average in 2012.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
