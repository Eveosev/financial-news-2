Kinder Morgan  Energy Partners LP,
the biggest U.S. pipeline operator, said third-quarter profit
rose as higher crude prices boosted revenue at its oil-producing
unit.  Net income increased to $379 million in the quarter from
$215 million a year ago, Houston-based Kinder Morgan said in a
statement today. After payments to Kinder Morgan Inc., its
parent company, Kinder Morgan lost 6 cents per partnership unit,
compared with a loss of 25 cents per unit in the same quarter of
2011.  Distributable  cash flow , a measure of the company’s ability
to make payments to its unit holders, rose to $455 million from
$394.1 million a year ago.  Kinder Morgan was expected to earn more money from its
carbon dioxide division, which produces oil from fields in
 Texas , Tanjila Shafi, an analyst with Standard & Poor’s Equity
Services, said in an interview before the earnings were
released. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude averaged
$92.20 a barrel during the third quarter, compared with $89.54
in 2011.  Kinder Morgan Inc. bought El Paso Corp. in May for $22.8
billion. Kinder Morgan took non-cash writedowns totaling $634
million during the first two quarters of 2012 to account for the
value of pipelines it agreed to sell to gain regulatory approval
the El Paso purchase.  Kinder Morgan rose 0.4 percent to $85.96 at the close in
 New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
