The number of people falling ill
from tuberculosis dropped last year, though the decline for the
world’s second-biggest infectious killer in  Europe  and  Africa  is
not on target, the World Health Organization said.  About 8.7 million people were newly diagnosed with the
disease, compared with  8.8 million  in 2010, the Geneva-based
United Nations health agency said today in an e-mailed
statement. Deaths caused by the airborne bacteria fell to 1.4
million globally from 1.45 million, the WHO said.  While the rate of new cases and deaths declined in all six
WHO regions, Africa and Europe aren’t on schedule to meet goals
to halve 1990 levels of mortality in the next three years, the
agency said. Only 20 percent of patients with a form of
tuberculosis that resists treatment with multiple drugs have
been diagnosed, the WHO estimated. The first new medicines to
combat the disease in more than 40 years may reach the market in
2013, the organization said.  “We are now at a crossroads between TB elimination within
our lifetime, and millions more TB deaths,” Mario Raviglione,
director of the  World Health Organization ’s Stop TB Partnership,
said in the statement.  The WHO report, to be published on its  website , contains
information from 204 countries and territories.  To contact the reporter on this story:
