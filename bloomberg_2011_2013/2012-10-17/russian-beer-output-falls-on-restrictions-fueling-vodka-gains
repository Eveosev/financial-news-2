Russian beer output fell for a
second consecutive month in September after the country imposed
restrictions on sales in July.  Production fell 6.2 percent from a year earlier to 67.9
million decaliters, the Russian Statistics Service, or  Rosstat ,
said in a statement today. Output declined 1.8 percent in August
to 90.9 million decaliters, Rosstat reported Oct.1.  Russia banned kiosks from selling beer containing more than
5 percent of alcohol from July 1 and outlawed beer advertising
on television, radio, billboards and internet from July 23. The
measures, designed to fight alcoholism in the country, led to
increased output of vodka and cognac. Vodka production rose 15
percent in September to 9 million decaliters, while cognac
output gained 26 percent to 843,000 decaliters, Rosstat said.  Carlsberg A/S (CARLA) ,  Heineken NV (HEIA)  and  Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI)  are
among the largest beer producers in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
