The pound extended an advance
against the dollar and pared its drop against the euro after the
Bank of England said policy makers were split on the need for
more stimulus at their Oct. 3-4 meeting.  Sterling rose 0.2 percent to $1.6149 at 9:32 a.m. London
time. It was 0.2 percent weaker at 81.19 pence per euro after
depreciating as much as 0.4 percent.  Policy makers voted 9-0 to keep the central bank’s bond-
purchase target at 375 billion pounds ($605 billion), according
to the minutes.  “Some members felt that there was considerable scope for
asset purchases to provide further stimulus,” the central bank
said. “Other members, while acknowledging that asset purchases
had the scope to lower long-term yields further, questioned the
magnitude of the impact that lower long-term yields on corporate
debt and equity would have on the broader economy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
