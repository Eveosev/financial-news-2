Poland is seeking to host next
year’s  United Nations  climate summit, which is scheduled to take
place in an eastern European country, Environment Minister
Marcin Korolec said.  “We have experience organizing the 2008 Conference of
Parties and heading the European Union delegation at the
previous climate summit,” Korolec said by e-mail yesterday.
“We know how to grow and cut emissions. All ingredients are
there for a good negotiation session.”  Climate envoys worldwide aim to negotiate a new global
agreement to cut  greenhouse gases , which scientists blame for
 climate change . At the last summit in Durban,  South Africa , more
than 190 nations agreed to adopt by 2015 a pollution-curbing
deal with legal force to be enacted by 2020 and to include both
industrialized and poor countries.  The decision on which country will host the 2013 gathering
will be taken during this year’s summit in Doha, Qatar, next
month. The Polish candidacy, which has already been approved by
the government, now needs backing from eastern European
countries, according to the  Environment Ministry . The hosting of
the meetings rotates between regional groups.  “By aspiring to organize the next conference of parties we
are sending a clear signal that the main priority of climate
policy should be the signing of a global deal,” Korolec said.
“Europe will only be able to lead the process if we manage to
convince our partners to join.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
