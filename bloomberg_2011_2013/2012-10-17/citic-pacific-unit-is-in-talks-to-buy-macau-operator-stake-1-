Citic Pacific Ltd. (267) , controlled by
 China ’s biggest state-owned investment company, said a unit is
in talks to buy  Cable & Wireless Communications Plc (CWC) ’s stake in a
Macau service operator to increase its shareholding.  Citic Telecom International Holdings Ltd. (1883)  plans to buy
Cable & Wireless’s 51 percent stake in  Companhia de
Telecomunicacoes de Macau, S.A.R.L.  to boost its holding to 71
percent, Citic Pacific said today in a statement. Cable &
Wireless confirmed the talks in a separate statement. The
companies didn’t provide financial details of the planned deal.  The purchase would be Citic Pacific’s first since 2009,
when it bought a 10 percent stake in a Shanghai real estate
management company, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.
Acquisitions of telecommunication companies have slowed
worldwide, with $83.9 billion of completed purchases so far this
year, compared with $180.3 billion in the same period of 2011,
the data show.  Citic Telecom  climbed  6.1 percent to close at HK$1.73 in
Hong Kong trading, the highest level since March 16. Citic
Pacific closed 1 percent higher at HK$9.72. Cable & Wireless
advanced 3.7 percent to 37.54 pence as of 9:30 a.m. in London,
poised for the largest gain in a month.  Citic Telecom expects to fund the proposed acquisition with
internal resources, bank loans or debt, or equity financing,
according to the Citic statement.  Citic Pacific is a steelmaker and property developer that
is building an $8 billion iron ore mine in Western Australia.
The Hong Kong-based company is considering selling part of its
controlling stake in Citic Telecom to its parent in order to
focus on its core business, it said.  Cable & Wireless Communications, based in  London , was split
from Cable & Wireless Worldwide in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
