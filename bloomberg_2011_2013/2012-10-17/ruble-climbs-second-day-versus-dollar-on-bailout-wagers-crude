The ruble advanced for a second day
after Spain kept its investment-grade  credit rating  from Moody’s
Investors Service, boosting investor appetite for riskier
assets.  The ruble appreciated 0.6 percent to 30.7350 per dollar at
7 p.m. in Moscow. The Russian currency dropped 0.3 percent
versus the euro to 40.3700 and was up 0.1 percent against the
central bank’s euro-dollar target basket.  Moody’s kept Spain’s credit rating at Baa3, its lowest
investment grade, as the risk that the country would lose  market
access  had fallen because of the  European Central Bank ’s
willingness to purchase its bonds. The euro gained as much as
0.6 percent to $1.3137, the highest level since Sept. 17. Oil in
 New York  traded 0.2 percent down at $91.86 a barrel after
advancing as much as 0.8 percent.  “We see everything is positive for the ruble, the euro is
growing and oil is not falling a few percent a day,” Igor Akinshin, a currency trader at Moscow-based OAO Alfa Bank, said
by phone. “There is appetite for risk.”  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.2125 per
dollar in three months compared with 31.3470 yesterday.  The extra yield investors demand to own  Russia ’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries fell seven basis points to 171,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index
of five-year government bond yields fell 15 basis points to 6.98
percent, the steepest drop since Aug. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
