Carbon dioxide emissions from
Finnish power producers fell by 43 percent in the first nine
months of 2012 compared with the same period last year,
according to the country's Energy Industries Association.  Increased imports of electricity from  Sweden  together with
high domestic hydropower output displaced generation from carbon
dioxide-emitting thermal power stations, according to  data 
published on the associationâ€™s website today.  Net power imports to  Finland  rose 31 percent to 13.2
terawatt-hours in the nine months, mainly due to a more than 23-
fold increase to 11.2 terawatt-hours in net imports from Sweden.
The increased imports caused thermal power output to decline by
27 percent to 20 terawatt-hours, the data showed.  Finnish hydropower output rose by 45 percent to 12.1
terawatt-hours, according to the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
