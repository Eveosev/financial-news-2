BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  Chief Executive
Officer Laurence D. Fink said his firm won’t chase
“unattractive” or low-fee business to bolster assets under
management.  BlackRock said today in a statement announcing third-
quarter earnings that a single institutional investor pulled
more than $72 billion from a fixed-income portfolio, after the
firm didn’t want to rebid for the business at lower fees.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
