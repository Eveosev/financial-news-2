California , the most indebted U.S.
state, may sell $7.5 billion of bonds in the next fiscal year,
Treasurer Bill Lockyer said, 42 percent more than the current
year.  About $5.27 billion of the securities would be general-
obligation bonds and the rest lease-revenue debt, Lockyer said
today at a Bond Buyer conference in San Francisco. For the
present fiscal year that began July 1, Lockyer has said he
expects to offer $5.25 billion. He’s already sold $1.174 billion
of that total.  The amount of debt sold in the next fiscal year must still
be approved in the budget that Governor Jerry Brown will propose
in January.  A California bond maturing in 10 years traded yesterday at
an average yield of 2.289 percent, or 64 basis points more than
 top rated bonds , according to Bloomberg data. That’s down from
68 basis points when the bonds were sold in September.  To contact the reporters on this story:
