U.S. regulators ratified a proposal
from  AT&T (T)  Inc. and Sirius XM Radio Inc. that would let the
mobile phone provider offer more wireless data service while
protecting satellite radio subscribers from interference.  The rules, approved today by the Federal Communications
Commission on a 5-0 vote, affect airwaves known as the Wireless
Communications Service band and nearby frequencies used by
Sirius to reach 23.4 million subscribers.  AT&T has proposed buying Wireless Communications Service
airwaves from Comcast Corp.,  Nextwave Wireless Inc. (WAVE)  and Horizon
Wi-Com LLC, according to  an FCC notice  seeking comments on the
acquisitions.  Limitations intended to protect Sirius have kept mobile
service providers from making intensive use of the Wireless
Communications Service band, AT&T and Sirius said in a June 15
filing that offered what they called a compromise.  Sirius (SIRI)  has
operated with uncertainty about whether the FCC would change the
rules in ways that would permit interference with satellite
signals, the companies said.  The FCC is trying to free more airwaves for use by high-
speed wireless devices such as Apple Inc.â€™s iPhone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
