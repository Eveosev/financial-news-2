Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  said it expects
the U.S. Justice Department will complete a review of the
company’s agreement to sell a majority stake to  Softbank Corp. (9984) 
within an initial 30-day period and won’t warrant an extended
investigation.  Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust law, if regulators
need more time to analyze a transaction, they can issue a
“second request” extending the review period beyond 30 days.  “We expect the Justice Department antitrust review will be
complete within the initial 30-day waiting period, without the
need for a second-phase investigation,”  John Taylor , a
spokesman for  Overland Park , Kansas-based Sprint, said yesterday
in a telephone interview. “We don’t expect significant
regulatory concerns.”  Taylor said the companies haven’t yet filed for antitrust
approval. Sprint has said it expects the deal to win all
regulatory approvals required by mid-2013 when it expects to
close the transaction.  Gina Talamona, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined
to comment on the possible review.  Editors: Fred Strasser, Michael Hytha  To contact the reporter on this story:
