American International Group Inc. (AIG) 
warrants jumped to a 20-month high as the stock rallies amid
optimism for improved business performance as the U.S. winds
down a bailout of the insurer.  The  warrants  advanced 1.6 percent to $15.42 at 10:43 a.m.
in  New York . The contracts allow investors to buy AIG common
stock at $45 apiece by Jan. 19, 2021. Shares of the New York-
based insurer climbed 1.4 percent to $36.85.  AIG’s  stock  has surged 59 percent this year, the best
performance among 22 companies on the  Standard & Poor’s 500
Insurance Index (S5INSU) , as the U.S. Treasury Department sold a majority
stake acquired in the company’s bailout. AIG will record a
fourth straight  profit  when the insurer reports quarterly
results Nov. 1, according to  analysts’ estimates , as the insurer
works to improve results at its Chartis international property-
casualty unit by shunning lower-priced business.  “AIG’s turnaround will be driven by management’s efforts
to fix Chartis,” Josh Stirling, an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein & Co., wrote in a research note yesterday. “With
clear catalysts to outperform in a stable market as the Treasury
exits, and yet less downside than many more-levered financial
names, AIG is our favorite ‘risk-on’ trade.”  The U.S. cut its  stake  in AIG to 16 percent from 77 percent
in four share sales this year, after acquiring 92 percent in a
bailout that swelled to $182.3 billion during the financial
crisis. The insurer bought back $13 billion of stock, helping
boost per-share earnings.  The AIG warrants changed hands for more than $23 in January
of 2011 in their first week of trading. They fell by more than
half that year as the insurer faced losses from the earthquake
and tsunami in  Japan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
