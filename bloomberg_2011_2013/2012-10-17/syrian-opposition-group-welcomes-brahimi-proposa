The opposition  Syrian National
Council  welcomed a proposal by United Nations special envoy to
 Syria  Lakhdar Brahimi to halt fighting during the Islamic Eid
holiday,  Al Arabiya  television reported.  “We welcome any end to the killing of Syrian civilians,
but all responsibility falls on the regime regarding this,”
Abdelbaset Sieda, the head of the council, told Al Arabiya in an
interview. “If the regime stops the shelling, normally, the
defensive acts will cease in turn.”  Brahimi asked the Iranian authorities to help arrange a
cease-fire in Syria during Eid al-Adha, one of the holiest
holidays celebrated by Muslims around the world, according to an
e-mailed statement from his spokesman on Oct. 15. Any initiative
“requires commitment by all sides in order for it to succeed,”
including from countries that have “influence over armed
groups,” the  Syrian Arab News Agency  reported yesterday, citing
Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi.  International efforts to end the 19-month conflict in Syria
have failed as various rebels group across the country battle to
oust President Bashar al-Assad from power, The fighting has
killed more than 30,000 people, according to the opposition
Syrian Observatory for  Human Rights .  Syrian security forces killed at least 134 people across
the country yesterday, among them six women and 17 children, the
opposition group, Local Coordination Committees, said in an e-
mail.  To contact the reporters on this story:
