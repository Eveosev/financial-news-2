Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the accused
chief plotter of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, returned
to court today after voluntarily skipping yesterday’s hearing at
the U.S. Navy base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  Mohammed for the first time wore a military-style
camouflage vest, a day after the military judge ruled that such
attire would be permitted as long as it’s not a part of any U.S.
military uniform.  Mohammed’s attorney yesterday argued for the right to wear
such clothing, saying it resembles what the defendant wore as a
member of the Mujuahadeen force in  Afghanistan  when it was under
Soviet occupation. Prosecutors opposed the measure, saying
camouflage could pose a security threat if it could be confused
with a U.S. military uniform.  To contact the reporter on this story:
