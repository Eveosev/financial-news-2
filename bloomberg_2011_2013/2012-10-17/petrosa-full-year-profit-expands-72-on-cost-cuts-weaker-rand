PetroSA Ltd.,  South Africa ’s state
oil and gas company, said full-year profit rose 72 percent as it
cut costs and the rand fell, raising local-currency earnings.  Net income grew to 1.37 billion rand ($157 million) in the
year ended in March from 799 million rand, and sales gained 37
percent to 14.4 billion rand, it said today in a statement.  “We continue with our cost containment,” Chief Financial
Officer Nkosemntu Nika said. “A feature of the balance sheet is
that it’s debt-free, providing us with a base to grow.”  PetroSA operates a gas-to-liquid refinery at  Mossel Bay 
about 390 kilometers (242 miles) east of  Cape Town  that’s able
to produce the equivalent of about 45,000 barrels of oil a day.
Offshore gas fields supplying the plant with feedstock are
depleting and the company is developing its five-well Ikhwezi
project with the aim of sustaining production until 2020.  Drilling is due to begin by the year-end and the first gas
output should start in the second half of 2013, Chief Executive
Officer Nosizwe Nokwe-Macamo told lawmakers today. “The focus
we have is on sustaining our gas-to-liquid plant,” she said.  Founded in 2002, Cape Town-based PetroSA produces about 5
percent of South Africa’s fuel and has stakes in oil and gas
fields in  Ghana  and  Equatorial Guinea . The company and China
Petroleum & Chemical Corp. agreed to study building South
Africa’s biggest oil refinery near the southern town of  Port
Elizabeth . The Mthombo plant will cost an estimated $10 billion.  PetroSA will need support for the project as South Africa
faces “a real risk” of fuel supply shortages in the short- to
medium-term, the company said in a presentation to lawmakers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
