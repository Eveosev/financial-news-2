Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. (KIO)  expects to
restart production within days at its Sishen mine in South
Africa after a two-week strike at the  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  unit
ended with police arrests.  “Production itself should start on Friday,” Gert Schoeman, a company spokesman, said today in a telephone
interview. “Won’t be full production from day one but things
are looking quite good at the moment.”  About 300 workers at Sishen downed tools on Oct. 3 to
demand higher pay as wildcat stoppages spread from the platinum
industry to gold, chrome and iron-ore. Police arrested more than
40 striking Kumba miners yesterday, after the company, which is
losing 120,000 metric tons of production a day, brought criminal
charges against the workers and recovered 3.3 billion rand ($376
million) of equipment.  Kumba rose to a  three-week high  in Johannesburg trading,
climbing as much as 2.3 percent to 516.3 rand, the highest
intraday level since Sept. 21. It was at 512.55 rand at 1:56
p.m. The benchmark FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index  was 0.8
percent  higher.  “There is high police visibility, which does help to calm
things down,” Schoeman said.  South African workers who go on strike without following
resolution procedures laid down under labor laws lose legal
protection and can risk dismissal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
