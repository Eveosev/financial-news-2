Hong Kong’s former secretary for
development Mak Chai-kwong and an assistant director of the
highways department have been charged with a housing fraud
involving more than HK$700,000 ($90,296).  Mak and the other official, Tsang King-man, face a joint
charge of conspiracy to defraud the Hong Kong government between
1985 and 1990, the  Independent Commission Against Corruption 
said in a  statement  on its website.  Mak and Tsang were arrested in July by the agency just days
after the new government of Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying was
sworn in. They will appear in the Eastern Magistrates’ Court
tomorrow for a mention of the charges that they falsely claimed
housing allowances from the government.  The two men concealed that they had an interest in the
flats that they leased from each other’s wives, the ICAC said.  Mak, 62, resigned from the government on the day of his
arrest in July. He and Tsang, 57, have been released on bail
pending their court appearance, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
