Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  may have sold out of
the initial run of the $499 version of its Surface tablet,
according to ordering information on the company’s website.  The device, a 32-gigabyte machine, was offered yesterday
for a limited number of early orders ahead of the Oct. 26
release. Microsoft’s orders site has gone from guaranteeing the
$499 model -- the cheapest -- for delivery by Oct. 26 to
requesting that customers “order now for shipment within three
weeks,” indicating the first batch has sold out.  The $599 model, which includes a black touch cover, and the
$699 64-gigabyte Surface, also with a black cover, are still
available for delivery by the 26th.  To contact the reporter on this story:
