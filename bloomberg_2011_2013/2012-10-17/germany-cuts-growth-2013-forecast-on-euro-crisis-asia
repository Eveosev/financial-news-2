The German government cut its
economic outlook for next year, citing stalling effects from the
debt crisis in the euro area and slower growth in Asia hurting
exports.  Europe’s largest economy will expand 1 percent in 2013,
compared with a forecast for gross domestic product growth of
1.6 percent projected in May, Economy Minister Philipp Roesler
said in Berlin today. He raised this year’s GDP forecast to 0.8
percent from 0.7 percent, citing a better-than-expected autumn.  “ Germany  is crossing through stormy waters because of the
European sovereign-debt crisis and economic weakening in
 developing countries  in Asia and  Latin America ,” Roesler said
in an e-mailed statement.  While he lauded the economy’s ability to hold up against
the global strain, Roesler pointed to the three-year-old crisis
that has sapped investor confidence as  Greece  struggles to stay
afloat and  Spain  mulls a request for aid. Slower growth in
countries such as China will also impact exports, which will
climb 4.4 percent next year instead of 5 percent.  Even though the outlook for German growth in the second
half of 2012 is better than expected in May, waning investment
will increasingly impact the economy over the winter months,
Roesler said. He predicted that the world economy will “come
back into swing” next year.  The economy minister also forecast a steady labor market,
with an average of 2.9 million Germans out of work over the
course of 2013.  To contact the reporters on this story:
