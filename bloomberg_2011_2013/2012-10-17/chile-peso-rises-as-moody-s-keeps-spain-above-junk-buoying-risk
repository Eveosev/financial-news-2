Chile ’s peso gained as Spain kept
its investment-grade credit rating from Moody’s Investors
Service, easing sovereign-debt concern and buoying emerging-
market assets.  The peso advanced 0.1 percent to 472.35 per U.S. dollar at
10:35 a.m. in Santiago. The currency has closed in a range of
470 to 476 per dollar in each session for the past six weeks as
speculation that Chile’s central bank may try to block an
advance prevented it from appreciating.  All except five of the 25 emerging-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg rallied against the dollar today as Moody’s
maintained Spain’s Baa3 credit rating, one step above junk,
while assigning a negative outlook. The company said Spain’s
refinancing risk has been reduced because of the European
Central Bank’s willingness to buy the nation’s debt.  “Spain is the main driver today,” said Andres de la Cerda, a money markets trader at Bice Inversiones. “The peso is
marginally higher than yesterday, in line with the external
environment. Everything’s positive.”  It will be difficult for the peso to trade weaker than 470
per dollar “because of concern about central bank
intervention,” he said.  International investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
cut their short peso position by $406 million to $7.7 billion on
Oct. 12, the lowest in two months, according to data published
today by the central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
