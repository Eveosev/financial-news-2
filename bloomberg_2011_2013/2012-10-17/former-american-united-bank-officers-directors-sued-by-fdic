Former American United Bank officers
and directors were sued by the  Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation  for $45.2 million over their alleged negligence in
managing the bank’s lending operations.  The lawsuit, filed today in federal court in Atlanta, names
as defendants former President and Chief Executive Officer T.
Glenn Thompson, former Senior Vice President and Chief Lending
Officer Joel C. Taylor, and six former directors.  “Rather than manage the bank’s lending function in a sound
and responsible manner, the defendants took unreasonable risks
with the bank’s loan portfolio,” the FDIC said in the
complaint.  American United Bank, based in Lawrenceville,  Georgia , was
closed by state regulators in 2009. Ameris Bank of Moultrie,
Georgia, agreed to assume all American United Bank’s deposits,
the FDIC said in 2009.  The case wasn’t immediately available in electronic court
records and information on attorneys for the defendants wasn’t
available.  The case is FDIC v. Thompson, 12-cv-03620, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of Georgia (Atlanta).  To contact the reporter on this story:
