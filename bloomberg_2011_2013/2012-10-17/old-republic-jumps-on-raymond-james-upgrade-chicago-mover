Old Republic International Corp. (ORI) 
climbed the most since May as Raymond James & Associates
upgraded the insurer to outperform, saying its main mortgage-
insurance unit may avoid being put into receivership.  Old Republic  jumped  4.6 percent to $10.54 at 4:01 p.m. in
New York. The Chicago-based insurer has advanced 14 percent this
year, matching the gains of the 400-member Standard & Poor’s
 Midcap 400 Index. (MID)   Raymond James upgraded the company after attending a
hearing in  North Carolina  addressing the corrective-action plan
on the insurer’s mortgage-guaranty unit. The state Department of
Insurance put Old Republic under supervision rather than
receivership.  “We believe the accelerated prepayment risk for the
company’s convertible debt is off the table,” C. Gregory Peters, an analyst at  Raymond James , said in a note today.
“Therefore, we are upgrading the stock based on its attractive
valuation and dividend yield.”  The Department of Insurance is expected to issue a final
plan in the next few weeks, according to Raymond James. The firm
has a $12 target price on Old Republic and lifted its rating
from market perform.  To contact the reporter on this story:
