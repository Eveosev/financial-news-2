Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  has
shifted “tens of thousands” of cars that were originally
targeted for  Europe  to the U.S. and Asia this year as sales
weaken in the crisis-hit region.  “Challenges in Europe are getting greater,”  Ian Robertson , sales chief for the world’s largest luxury-car brand,
said to reporters today at a company event in Munich. The region
faces “a lot of bumps on the road” before it stabilizes and an
auto-market recovery could take years, he said.  Europe’s car industry is poised to suffer its biggest
annual sales drop in 19 years in 2012. Munich-based BMW has
avoided the brunt of the European sovereign-debt crisis thanks
to demand in the U.S. and China for models like the new 3-Series
sedan. The brand sold 14 percent more cars and sport-utility
vehicles in September globally, helping boost nine-month
deliveries 8.6 percent to 1.11 million vehicles.  Robertson said he expects “good” growth in the U.S. in
October and November, and  China  is still attractive, even if
growth has slowed since the beginning of the year.  “The slowdown in China is part of what’s happening in
Europe,” as the effects of the debt crisis ripple beyond the
continent, he said.  The growth elsewhere doesn’t help BMW’s partners in Europe,
and the company may need to help dealers through the crisis,
especially in  Spain  where it faces “some very difficult
decisions” on restructuring the dealership network, Robertson
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
