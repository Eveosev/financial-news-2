Weight-loss  surgical procedures such as stomach stapling and gastric banding reduce the warning signs of  heart disease  more dramatically than drug treatments and can be life-saving, according to a survey of 73 previous studies.  For more than half of the almost 20,000 patients included in the research, risk factors for stroke, heart attack and heart failure -- such as high  blood pressure , diabetes and high cholesterol -- significantly improved or were resolved, said researchers led by Amanda Vest of the Cleveland Clinic in  Ohio .  The survey  was published yesterday in the U.K. journal Heart, which commissioned the research.  At least  2.8 million  adults die each year as a result of being overweight or obese, according to the Geneva-based  World Health Organization . Candidates for bariatric surgery, designed to limit food intake, include those who are more than 100 pounds (45 kilograms) over their ideal body weight.

Complications  include wound infection, bleeding, gallstones and nutritional deficiencies, according to the  Cleveland Clinic .  Almost half of patients undergoing gastric banding for obesity needed to have the device removed, often because of erosion, according to a  study  published by the Archives of Surgery this year.  Weight-loss surgery is too often thought of as a “quick fix” that patients choose without properly assessing the risks, according to the Obesity Management Association, a UK-based patient advocacy group.  “Bariatric surgery does have a role to play in obesity management, but we should explore every other option before we resort to surgery,” Robert Houtman, director of the OMA, said in a statement today.  Still, severely obese people benefit from weight-loss surgery, the  American Heart Association  said in a policy statement March 14. The group, for the first time, said the risks of the procedure aren’t as great as the help provided by the reduction in the risk of diabetes, high cholesterol and heart ailments associated with obesity.
