Natural gas futures climbed in New
York for the first time in three days on speculation that
government data may show a smaller-than-normal increase in
stockpiles for last week.  Gas advanced as much as 1.3 percent before the Energy
Department report tomorrow that may show an inventory gain of 47
billion cubic feet in the week ended Oct. 12, according to the
median of 15 analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The five-
year average gain for the week is 71 billion.  “It was a little colder last week, so the storage
injection may be a bit smaller than average,” said  Phil Flynn ,
senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group in  Chicago .
“Traders have been anticipating the upcoming winter demand.”  Natural gas for November delivery rose 1.9 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $3.456 per million British thermal units at 11:52
a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The futures are down
6.3 percent from a year ago. Prices reached $3.611 per million
Btu on Oct. 12, the highest settlement since Dec. 1.  December $3.05 puts were the most active gas options in
electronic trading. They were 0.2 cent lower at 0.8 cent on
volume of 821 contracts as of 11:41 p.m. Puts accounted for 46
percent of options volume.  Inventories of gas totaled 3.725 trillion cubic feet in the
week ended Oct. 5, 7.8 percent above the five-year average. The
 surplus  to the average was down from 61 percent on March 30.
Stockpiles may reach 3.903 trillion by Oct. 31, below estimated
capacity of 4.239 trillion, Energy Department data show.  Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland ,
predicted cooler-than-normal weather in the central U.S. from
Oct. 27 through Oct. 31.  Cooler Weather  The low in Chicago on Oct. 27 may be 27 degrees Fahrenheit
(minus 3 Celsius), 15 below normal, according to  AccuWeather
Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania . The low in  Minneapolis  may
be 24 degrees, 12 less than the usual reading.  About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
according to the Energy Department.  The winter of 2012-2013 will probably boost the use of
heating fuels compared with last year and leave above-normal
snowfall from  Massachusetts  to  Alabama , AccuWeather said.  The coldest part of the winter will probably be in
February, with slightly warmer-than-average weather in December
that may bring the entire season near normal, said  Paul Pastelok , long-range forecaster for AccuWeather.  A boom in oil and natural gas production helped the U.S.
cut its reliance on imported fuel. America met 83 percent of its
energy needs in the first six months of the year, department
data show. If the trend goes on through 2012, it will be the
highest level of self-sufficiency since 1991.  The number of rigs drilling for natural gas in the U.S.
fell by 15 to 422 last week, the lowest level since June 1999,
according to data released Oct. 12 by Baker Hughes Inc. in
Houston. The rig count has dropped 48 percent this year.  U.S. natural gas may need to rise to $6 per million Btu to
spur enough production to meet liquefied natural gas export
demand, Howard Rogers, director of natural gas research at the
Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, said in a report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
