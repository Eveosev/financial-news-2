Kuwait  Oil Co. is burning an oil
well in northern Kuwait to contain a poisonous gas leak,
Chairman Sami Al-Rushaid said.  The area surrounding Rawdatain, where the well is located,
was evacuated, Al-Rushaid said.  Production from the well was halted. Residents in Kuwait
were told to stay indoors and close windows as the smell of
hydrogen sulphide affected all residential areas in the country.  “All readings are down now, of H2S, since they started
burning the well,” KOC spokesman AbdulKhaleq al-Ali said by
phone. “The well is being dealt with as a fire now, not as a
gas. The gas danger is gone.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
