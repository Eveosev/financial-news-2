The  New York  Knicks exercised their
third-year option on guard Iman Shumpert, who is going through
rehabilitation for a left knee injury, said General Manager Glen Grunwald.  The 22-year-old Shumpert is recovering from a torn anterior
cruciate ligament and lateral meniscus. He was injured in a
100-67 playoff loss to the Miami Heat on April 28.  Shumpert averaged 9.5 points, 3.2 rebounds, 2.8 assists and
1.7 steals in 59 National Basketball Association games last
season.  Selected in the first round of the 2011 draft, Shumpert was
named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team last season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
