ThinkEquity LLC is closing its
stock-trading business today amid a market slump and preparing
to transfer its remaining investment-banking unit to another
firm, Chief Executive Officer Greg Wright said.  ThinkEquity, which employs a total of about 100 people, is
determining how many jobs will be cut, he said in a telephone
interview. Wright said another firm, which he declined to
identify, has offered to take over San Francisco-based
ThinkEquity’s investment-banking business and hire some workers.
Details may be announced as soon as tomorrow, he said.  ThinkEquity joins other firms closing or shrinking their
stock-trading businesses as investors trade less and pay lower
commissions. Nomura Holdings Inc.,  Japan ’s biggest brokerage,
cut as many as 30 jobs in its Americas equity division in
September and New York-based Oscar Gruss & Son Inc. closed its
merger-arbitrage unit last week.  Average daily volume  for U.S.
equities was 6 billion shares in the third quarter, the lowest
since at least 2008.  “It’s an impossibly tough business,” Wright said.
“Spreads are compressing, of course, but volumes have
collapsed. There aren’t enough commission dollars today for the
number of market participants so there will be further
consolidation.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
