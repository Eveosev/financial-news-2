Argentina  plans to increase corn
export quotas for the 2012-2013 crop as the government seeks
additional revenue for energy subsidies, said a government
official.  The additional quota would be announced in late December or
early January, if the cereal’s estimated planted area remains at
4 million hectares, rain continues benefiting the crop and
there’s no repeat of last year’s drought, said the official, who
asked not to be named because the decision relies on weather
conditions. Argentina charges export taxes on agricultural
products including corn and soybeans, its biggest source of
export revenue.  Authorities will allow the export of an additional 7
million metric tons of corn to an announced 15 million metric
tons, the official said.  The Agricultural Ministry is forecasting a 2012-2013
harvest of at least 28 million tons. Argentina, the second-
largest corn exporter, was listed as an approved supplier to
 China , the second-biggest consumer of the crop, in April.  Alejandra Koser, a press officer at the agriculture
ministry in  Buenos Aires , declined to comment on an expanded
quota.  To contact the reporter on this story:
