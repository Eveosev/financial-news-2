Japanese  shares  gained, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rising to its highest in nearly two
weeks, after U.S. industrial production and corporate earnings
beat expectations.  Uniden Corp. (6815) , an electronic-equipment maker that counts
North America as its biggest market, rose 2.9 percent.  Sony
Corp. (6758) , a consumer electronics company that gets a fifth of its
sales in Europe, gained 2 percent after German officials eased
rhetoric over aid to nations in the monetary union.  Misumi Group
Inc. (9962)  jumped 3.7 percent after the distributor of precision
machine parts said it will acquire Dayton Progress Corp. of the
U.S. and the components division of Canada’s Anchor Danly Co.  The Nikkei 225 rose 1.2 percent to 8,806.55 at the 3 p.m.

have started pouring money into shares. Investors are gradually
moving into risk as they see more figures confirming that the
U.S. economy and corporate earnings aren’t as bad as thought.”  The Topix has risen 2.9 percent from Sept. 6, when the
 European Central Bank  initiated a global wave of stimulus to
boost growth, with the U.S. Federal Reserve and the  Bank of
Japan  following suit. Shares on the stock gauge traded at 0.89

Tokyo, compared with 102.32 at the close of stock trading
yesterday. A weaker yen boosts the value of income at Japanese
companies when repatriated.  Misumi advanced 3.7 percent to 1,948 yen after saying it
will spend about $200 million to acquire Dayton Progress and the
components division of Anchor Danly from Connell Ltd.
Partnership of Boston.  Companies that supply  Intel Corp. (INTC)  declined after the
