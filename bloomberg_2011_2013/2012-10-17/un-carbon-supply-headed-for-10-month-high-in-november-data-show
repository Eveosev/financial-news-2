Supply of United Nations carbon
offsets, known as Certified Emission Reductions or CERs, in
November is headed for the most since January, UN data show.  The executive board of the UN’s Clean Development
Mechanism, the body responsible for regulating CERs,  is
scheduled  to deliver a total of 28 million metric tons of
credits from Nov. 1 through Nov. 15, compared with 27 million in
October, according to UN data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
biggest monthly volume since January and the seventh-largest on
record, the data show. The schedule for the remainder of
November is yet to be completed.  Prices for UN offsets for December fell to a record 1.43
euros ($1.85) a ton on Sept. 18 after total supply of CERs
reached 1 billion tons a week earlier. They rose 2.6 percent to
1.58 euros at 3:07 p.m. London time.  CERs are generated by clean-technology projects in
 developing countries  that reduce pollution compared with a
business-as-usual scenario. Factories and power stations
participating in carbon markets in the European Union,  Australia 
and  New Zealand  may use CERs to meet part of their cap on
greenhouse-gas emissions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
