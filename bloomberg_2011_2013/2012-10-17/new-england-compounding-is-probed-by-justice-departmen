New England Compounding Pharmacy
Inc., which does business as New England Compounding Center, is
being investigated by the U.S.  Justice Department  after an
outbreak of fungal meningitis was linked to steroid shots it
manufactured.  “This office and our law enforcement partners are
investigating allegations concerning the New England Compounding
Center,” U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz in Boston said yesterday in
a statement. “It is entirely premature to suggest what the
results of the investigation will be.”  The U.S. fungal meningitis outbreak that began with a
steroid used for back pain has led to 233  infections , killing 16
people, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the
Virginia Department of Health said yesterday. Any drug meant to
be injected that was manufactured by New England Compounding
Center may be tainted, the  Food and Drug Administration  said
Oct. 15 on its website.  Krista Robinson, an outside spokeswoman for Framingham,
Massachusetts-based New England Compounding, didn’t immediately
return a call for comment on the Justice Department’s statement
after regular business hours yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
