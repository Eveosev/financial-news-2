U.S. President Barack Obama has more
support among backers of President  Vladimir Putin ’s United
Russia party than among all Russians in his bid for reelection,
an opinion poll showed.  Forty-four percent of respondents who back the governing
party say Obama would be a better U.S. leader for Russia, more
than the average 42 percent for all Russians, the state-run All-
Russian Center for the Study of  Public Opinion , or VTsIOM, said
today in an e-mailed  statement . Five percent of United Russia
backers said challenger Mitt Romney would be better for Russia’s
national interests,  Just 40 percent of Russians know that the U.S. presidential
elections will be this year. The poll of 1,600 Russians was
conducted Sept. 15-16. It has a margin of error of 3.4
percentage points.  Putin, who helped found United Russia a decade ago, handed
the party’s chairmanship to Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev  last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
