China Life Insurance Co. (2628) , the
nation’s biggest insurer, said profit for the first nine months
of this year may fall about 55 percent because of lower
investment yields and bigger impairment losses.  The estimated decline in net income, based on unaudited
numbers, is a result of “continued weakness in the  capital
markets ,” the Beijing-based company said in a statement to the
Hong Kong stock exchange today. Profit for the same period in
2011 was 16.7 billion  yuan  ($2.7 billion), it said.  China Life in August reported a 26 percent profit decline
for the first half year after an almost 20 percent slump in the
benchmark  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  in the year ended June 30
crimped investment returns and premiums income dropped. The
equity gauge slid a further 6 percent in the third quarter as
the nation’s economic expansion cooled.  “That’s below market consensus,” said Olive Xia, a
Shanghai-based analyst at Core Pacific Yamaichi International
Ltd., citing a third-quarter loss of about 3 billion yuan based
on her calculations. “The stock market really did poorly last
quarter and insurers’ profitability remains quite sensitive to
investment returns.”  China Life fell 1.7 percent to HK$23.00 today in Hong Kong
trading, trimming this year’s gain to 20 percent. The  Hang Seng
Index  rose 1 percent today. The company’s Shanghai-traded shares
slumped 4 percent, the most in more than two months.  China Life is scheduled to report nine-month results on Oct.
