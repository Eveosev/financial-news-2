Canadian  stocks  rose to their
highest level in a month as energy shares rallied after  Exxon
Mobil  Corp. agreed to acquire oil and gas producer Celtic
Exploration Ltd. and U.S. housing starts jumped to a four-year
high.  Celtic Exploration jumped 45 percent after agreeing to a
C$2.86 billion ($2.91 billion) sale to Exxon Mobil.  Encana Corp. (ECA)

gains in the benchmark equity gauge as six of 10 industries
advanced on trading 16 percent higher than the 30-day average.  “There’s a positive tone in oils because of the surprise
takeover of  Celtic Exploration, (CLT) ” said  Bob Decker , a  money
manager  at Aurion Capital in Toronto. His firm manages about
C$5.5 billion.  “It’s put a bid on most of the E&P companies with similar
assets and put a general positive tone on the sector,” Decker
said, referring to energy exploration and production companies
that also have interests in the Montney and Duvernay shale
fields in which Celtic operates.  Celtic surged 45 percent to C$26.29. Shareholders will
receive C$24.50 a share and half a share of a new company that
will hold assets not included in the agreement, Calgary-based

world’s largest energy company, significant new production in
the Alberta shale fields, where oil and gas are extracted by
horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing.  Shale Plays  Among Montney and Duvernay shale companies,  Cequence Energy
