U.S. stocks may have little more to
gain from the  Federal Reserve ’s third round of bond buying even
though the purchases have only begun, according to Gina Martin Adams, a Wells Fargo & Co. strategist.  As the CHART OF THE DAY depicts, the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index’s price-earnings ratio since June has tracked an expansion
that started in August 2010, when Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
foreshadowed the prior round of so-called quantitative easing
with a speech in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming. The P/E might be about a
month away from peaking, assuming the pattern holds.  “Over the last four years, investors have become
accustomed to one consistency in the equity market -- when the
Fed moves, stocks follow,” Martin Adams wrote two days ago in a
report featuring a similar chart. “Investors may have priced in
a new round of liquidity before it happened this time.”  Fed policy makers announced a plan on Sept. 13 for the
central bank to buy $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities
each month. The purchases will persist as long as the labor
market doesn’t “improve substantially,” according to a
statement they released that day.  The S&P 500’s higher valuation bolsters the argument for
buying defensive stocks, or shares of companies that are least
affected by economic swings,  Martin Adams  wrote. The New York-
based strategist favors investing in companies that sell food,
beverages and other consumer staples, along with health care.  To contact the reporter on this story:
