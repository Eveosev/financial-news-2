Oil fell in  New York  after trading
close to a one week-high amid signs that supply is plentiful.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its Brent price forecast for 2013
by 15 percent.  West Texas Intermediate futures dropped as much as 0.8
percent after closing at the highest level since Oct. 9. Crude
inventories in the U.S., the world’s biggest oil consumer,
gained 2.9 million barrels last week to 369 million, the highest
for this time of year since government records began in 1982,
the Energy Department said in a report yesterday. Goldman cut
its forecast for Brent to $110 a barrel from $130.  “There are very weak fundamentals in the oil market,”
said  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt .
“The U.S. data shows there is no bottleneck at all in supply.”  Crude for November delivery was at $91.63 a barrel, down 49
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 1:50 p.m. London time. The contract closed yesterday at
$92.12. Futures are down 7.3 percent this year.  Brent for December settlement dropped 87 cents to $112.35 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe . The front-month
European benchmark grade’s premium to the corresponding WTI
contract was at $20.27 a barrel. It settled at $23.95 on Oct.
15, the widest gap since reaching a record on Oct. 14, 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
