Turkey ’s reduction in bank borrowing
costs won’t deter Japanese demand for lira that has produced
carry returns of almost 16 percent this year, according to
Barclays Plc.  Issuance of lira-denominated uridashi bonds has jumped more
than 50 percent from the whole of last year to $3.2 billion in
2012. That’s the most foreign currency total after the
Australian dollar and compared with the next biggest $2.66
billion in Brazilian reais, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Uridashi bonds are typically issued in non-yen currencies and
sold to individual Japanese investors.  “The flows we saw in Turkey this year are still not at the
levels we saw in Brazil in 2009-2010 and the first half of
2011,” said Christian Keller, the London-based head of  emerging
markets  research at Barclays. “If that is any guide, you will
think that potential flows to Turkey have still a way to go.”  The lira fetched 1.8013 per dollar and 43.69 yen as of 1:43
p.m. in Tokyo. Turkey’s currency has risen 5 percent against the
U.S.’s and 7.4 percent against  Japan ’s in 2012. Economists in a
Bloomberg survey estimate the currency to appreciate to 1.79 per
dollar by the end of this year, and to 1.75 in 2013.  Carry trades that involve borrowing in a low-borrowing cost
nations to invest in higher-interest rate economies have been
popular among investors in Japan, where government bonds have
the world’s third-lowest yields. Those investors are sometimes
called “Mrs. Watanabe” as a reference to housewives who
control household purse strings.  Sharpe Ratio  The Sharpe ratio, a measure of return per unit of risk,
from borrowing in yen to buy lira was 1.9 since the end of 2011,
the highest among 44 currencies tracked by Bloomberg after the
Argentine peso. Two-year Turkish government debt  yielded  7.31
percent yesterday, the second-highest after  Brazil  in emerging
markets.  “We have had a long period where the Turkish lira has been
the lowest volatility, highest yielding carry currency,” Keller
said at an interview in Tokyo on Oct. 12. “If you are investing
in bonds longer term, the lira is a good currency to be long.”
A long is a bet that an asset’s price will increase.  Keller was a resident representative in Turkey at the
International Monetary Fund from 2005 to 2007. Prior to that, he
was based at the IMF headquarters in  Washington , working on
programs with emerging market economies in  Europe , Latin America
and Asia.  Turkish Central Bank Governor Erdem Basci reduced average
bank borrowing costs to 5.75 percent on Oct. 4, the lowest level
in 11 months, after he cut the upper end of his interest-rate
corridor by 150 basis points last month to spur growth.  To contact the reporters on this story:
