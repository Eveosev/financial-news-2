Fleet Aviation LLC , a charter-flight company servicing East Coast vacation destinations including the Hamptons on  New York ’s Long Island, filed to liquidate in bankruptcy.  Fleet Aviation, which flies out of New York’s Westchester County Airport, provides service to East Hampton and Montauk on Long Island, Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket in Massachusetts and Cape May in  New Jersey , according to its website.
