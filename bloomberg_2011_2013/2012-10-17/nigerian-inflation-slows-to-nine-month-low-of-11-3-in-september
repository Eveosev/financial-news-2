Nigeria ’s  inflation  rate fell to a
nine-month low of 11.3 percent in September as the impact of
rising fuel prices eased.  Inflation in Africa’s largest-oil producer slowed from 11.7
percent in August, the Abuja-based National Bureau of Statistics
said in an e-mailed report. The median estimate of 10 economists
 surveyed  by Bloomberg was 11 percent. Prices rose 1 percent in
the month.  The Central Bank of Nigeria, led by Governor Lamido Sanusi,
left its benchmark  interest rate  unchanged at a record 12
percent on Sept. 18 to help support the naira. The bank’s goal
is to bring the inflation rate down to below 10 percent.  Food prices, which account for more than half of the
 consumer price index , rose 10.2 percent in September, compared
with 9.9 percent in the previous month, the statistics office
said. The core inflation rate, which excludes agricultural food
products, fell to 13.1 percent from 14.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
