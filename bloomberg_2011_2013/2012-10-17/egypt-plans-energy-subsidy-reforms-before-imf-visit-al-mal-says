Egypt  plans energy-subsidy reforms
in two phases, the first to be implemented before an
International Monetary Fund delegation arrives at the end of the
month for talks on a $4.8 billion loan, Al Mal reported, citing
an unidentified person with knowledge of the matter.  The prices of 95 octane gasoline,  fuel oil  used in
factories and electricity consumed by households will be raised
in the next few days, the newspaper said.  Egypt plans to build up its strategic supplies of gasoline
and fuel oil, Al Mal said, citing Osama Kamal, the petroleum and
mineral resources minister. At present, butane gas supplies are
enough for 3.5 days, fuel oil for eight days and 90 octane
gasoline for six days, he said.  Officials may tie Egypt’s electricity network to those of
neighboring countries and talks on the country’s nuclear power
project take place this week, the newspaper said.  The Petroleum Ministry owes the Electricity Ministry 50
billion Egyptian pounds ($8.2 billion), Kamal told  Al Mal .
Petroleum subsidies are costing 10 billion pounds a month and
total subventions for the three months to September reached 28
billion. If that continues, subsidies are likely to reach 120
billion pounds by the end of the current fiscal year, the
minister said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
