Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Norway ’s biggest oil
company, joined Statkraft AS to buy an offshore wind project
from Warwick Energy Ltd., their third U.K. venture together.  Statoil will take a 70 percent share and Statkraft will own
the rest of the Dudgeon project, which has government consent to
install as much as 560 megawatts of turbines in the sea off
Norfolk in eastern  England , the oil producer said today in a
statement on its website. Terms weren’t disclosed.  “Warwick Energy has successfully progressed the technical
and commercial basis” for the wind farm, Statoil Vice President
for Renewable Energy Siri Kindem said in the statement.
“Statoil and Statkraft will now take this work forward.”  The U.K. has installed more offshore wind-power capacity
than any other country. Statoil and Statkraft, seeking to take
advantage of government incentives for clean-energy development,
completed a 317-megawatt wind project off Norfolk last month,
bringing Britain’s offshore capacity to more than 2.5 gigawatts.  The two companies are also collaborating with  RWE AG (RWE)  and
 SSE Plc (SSE)  to get consent for the Dogger Bank wind farm, 120
kilometers (75 miles) off northeastern England. At a planned 2.4
gigawatts, it has the potential to be the world’s largest
offshore wind project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
