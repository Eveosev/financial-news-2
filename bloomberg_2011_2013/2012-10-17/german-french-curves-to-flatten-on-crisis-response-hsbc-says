German and French bond yield curves
will flatten as a result of the introduction of measures to
tackle the euro-area debt crisis, according to  Steven Major ,
global head of fixed-income research at HSBC Holdings Plc.  The  difference  in yields between two- and 10-year German
bonds is 154 basis points, or 1.54 percentage points. The  gap 
between similar French securities is 205 basis points.  “ Germany  can get even flatter,” and the 10-year bund
yield may fall to 1 percent, Major said at a seminar in  London 
today. The yield slid to its record-low 1.127 percent for the
first time in June and closed at 1.63 percent today in London
trading. Similar-maturity French government debt yielded 2.25
percent.  Two-year German bunds yield 0.1 percent, compared with 0.2
percent for French sovereign debt of the same maturity.  The yield curves of the region’s so-called peripheral
nations, such as Spain and  Portugal , will steepen as the
European Central Bank introduces its plan to purchase unlimited
quantities of the debt of struggling economies, Major said. The
program, called Outright Monetary Transactions, will target
government bonds with maturities of one to three years, ECB
President Mario Draghi said on Sept. 6.  The  additional yield  investors demand to hold Spain’s 10-
year bonds over two-year notes was 271 basis points today, up
from as little as 73 basis points on July 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
