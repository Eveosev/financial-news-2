Punjab Biomass Power Ltd., a
developer of clean-energy projects in  India , plans to set up 96
megawatts of plants fueled by rice straw by 2017.  The company, backed by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial
Services Ltd. and Bermaco Energy Ltd., expects to raise 800
million rupees ($15.2 million) by February for its next plant in
northern Punjab state, Bermaco Managing Director Monish Ahuja
said in a phone interview today from Mumbai. It has an existing
12-megawatt plant in Patiala district.  India, the second-largest producer of rice and sugar,
estimates it has the potential to produce 17,536 megawatts of
power from burning crop waste, the equivalent capacity of about
16 nuclear plants. It has built 3,319 megawatts of biomass
capacity, including plants fueled by sugar-cane pulp that
produce both electricity and heat, according to  data  from the
Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.  Punjab Biomass plans seven more 12-megawatt projects that
will sell power to Punjab State Power Corp. That expansion may
include the purchase of a shuttered plant owned by the state
government, he said.  IL&FS owns 51 percent of Punjab Biomass, and the remainder
is held by Bermaco.  Gammon Infrastructure Projects Ltd. (GISP)  exited
the company last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
