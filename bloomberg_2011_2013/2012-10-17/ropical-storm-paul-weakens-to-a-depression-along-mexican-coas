Tropical Storm Paul has weakened to
a tropical depression and all warnings along  Mexico ’s Baja
California coast have been dropped.  Paul’s top winds have fallen to 35 miles (56 kilometers)
per hour as it churns along the Baja’s Pacific coast about 85
miles southeast of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, according to the U.S.
 National Hurricane Center .  “Paul is expected to degenerate into a remnant low-
pressure area later today,” according to a hurricane center
advisory at 8 a.m. Pacific time.  Paul may still cause life-threatening mudslides in the area
and leave as much as 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain before
it breaks up in the ocean off Mexico.  In the Atlantic, Hurricane Rafael swept past  Bermuda 
yesterday and is now 545 miles south-southeast of Halifax, Nova
Scotia, moving north-northeast at 35 mph, the center said.  Rafael will lose its tropical characteristics while
remaining a strong ocean storm today, according to the hurricane
center. Tropical systems have their strongest winds at their
core, while other systems aren’t that well organized.  It will move into the North Atlantic between  North America 
and  Europe  later this week.  -- Editors: Richard Stubbe, David Marino  To contact the reporters on this story:
