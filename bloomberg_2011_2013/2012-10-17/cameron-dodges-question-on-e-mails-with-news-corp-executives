U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
refused to say if he will submit private e-mails between him and
 News Corp. (NWSA)  executives to the Leveson Inquiry into media ethics.  Cameron was challenged today by opposition Labour lawmaker
 Chris Bryant , whose phone was hacked by the now-defunct News of
the World newspaper, to explain why he was withholding the e-
mails and text messages from the inquiry.  “I’m not going to answer any of his questions” until
Bryant apologizes about previous allegations he’s made, Cameron
told lawmakers in the House of Commons in London today.  Private e-mails exchanged with former News International
Chief Executive Officer Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, when he
was still editor of the News of the World, were withheld from
the Leveson Inquiry after Cameron sought legal advice, the
 Independent  newspaper reported yesterday without saying where it
got the information.  “All the material that the inquiry asked for was
provided,” Cameron’s spokeswoman, Vickie Sheriff, told
reporters yesterday. “We’ve cooperated fully with the inquiry
and we look forward to its report.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
