The  Bank of Japan (8301)  this month will
probably predict it will miss a 1 percent inflation goal in the
next two fiscal years, according to people familiar with the
matter.  BOJ board members will at month-end release updated
economic projections for the 2012 and 2013 fiscal years and the
first set of forecasts for the year beginning in April 2014. The
figures will probably show consumer prices, excluding fresh
food, rising less than 1 percent, the people said on condition
of anonymity because the discussions are private.  Price declines have  steepened  since May, showing the BOJ’s
struggle to attain its inflation target and adding pressure on
the bank to reverse deflation and aid growth. JPMorgan and UBS
AG are among those predicting the BOJ will boost asset purchases
for the second time in two months at the Oct. 30 board meeting.  “Achieving the 1 percent goal looks difficult,” said
 Hideo Kumano , chief economist at Dai-Ichi Life Research
Institute in Tokyo and a former central bank official. “I
expect the BOJ will put out a figure of 0.5 or 0.4 percent for
fiscal 2014, and the market will expect more easing until the
bank achieves its goal.”  Prices fell 0.3 percent in August from a year earlier, down
for the fourth straight month and matching the steepest decline
in 16 months. Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. expect the
Japanese economy to contract in the third and fourth quarters of
this calendar year.  The BOJ said in July that it expected prices to grow 0.7
percent in fiscal 2013 after a 0.2 percent gain this fiscal
year. At its last meeting that ended on Oct. 5, the central bank
held off from more easing after adding to stimulus in September.  To contact the reporters on this story:
