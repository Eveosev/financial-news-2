New York  City construction spending
will probably rise this year to the highest level since 2008 as
the rebuilding of the World Trade Center and demand for luxury
housing fuel a rebound, the New York Building Congress said.  About $30.7 billion will have been spent by the end of
December, up more than 9 percent from 2011, the trade group said
in a report today. It would be the first time in four years that
spending exceeded $30 billion, and it will probably stay above
that level in 2013, according to the report. The record of $31.1
billion was set in 2007, the group said.  The industry has had “a swift and rather remarkable
resurgence,”  Richard Anderson , president of the Building
Congress, said in a statement. “From the recently topped-out  1
World Trade Center  to the Second Avenue subway below, New York’s
private and public sector is investing heavily in its future.
The only disappointment in 2012 is that industry employment has
not kept pace with spending.”  Spending and employment plunged after the 2008 credit
crisis caused developers to postpone work on new office towers
and residential buildings. Rising public construction by the
city and the  Metropolitan Transportation Authority , which runs
New York’s subway and commuter trains, helped sustain the market
while the financial industry regained its footing.  Jobs Decline  Construction employment probably fell 0.6 percent this year
to 110,800 jobs, the fewest since 1998. Increased building
costs, better technology and productivity are holding down
hiring, according to the Building Congress, which represents New
York’s construction industry and unions. The group projected an
increase in the next two years to 113,400 jobs, still well below
the 2008 peak of 132,600.  Construction of commercial buildings including hotels,
 offices  and sports arenas such as  Brooklyn ’s new Barclays Center
is poised to reach a record of $12.6 billion this year, up from
$10.5 billion in 2011, according to the report. Such “big-
ticket” projects as 1 and 4 World Trade Center,  Boston
Properties Inc. (BXP) ’s office tower in progress at 205 West 55th St.
and the renovation of Madison Square Garden are leading the
surge, the group said.  Such spending will probably decline to about $8.8 billion
in 2014 as those developments wind down, according to the
report.  Spending on new housing should reach $3.2 billion this year
and keep climbing to $5.3 billion by 2014, an 83 percent
increase over 2011’s $2.9 billion, the group forecast. The city
is expected to add about 10,000 residential units in 2012, up
from the average of 7,300 in each of the past three years.  The city is experiencing a “mini-boom” in luxury housing
development because of high international demand and more widely
available financing, according to the report.  The Building Congress projected 12,500 housing units would
be added next year and 15,000 in 2014, still only about half of
the more than 30,000 constructed in 2006 and 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
