The Philippine peso advanced to a
four-year high on speculation fund inflows into  emerging markets 
will increase as central banks in developed economies loosen
monetary policies to spur growth.  Foreign investors bought $1.9 billion more local shares
than they sold this year, according to stock exchange data. The
Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank announced steps
last month to pump money into financial markets.  “The whole of emerging-market Asia foreign exchange is now
driven by anticipation of capital inflows,” said Wee-Khoon Chong, a strategist at Societe Generale SA in Hong Kong. “This
expectation has seen a rise in equities.”  The peso gained 0.4 percent to 41.175 per dollar in  Manila ,
according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It touched 41.165, the
strongest level since March 11, 2008. It strengthened 6.5
percent this year, the second-best performance among Asia’s 10
most-active currencies excluding the yen.  The  Philippines  plans to increase sales of government debt
in the local market this year by 9 percent to 585.1 billion
pesos ($14.2 billion), a funding plan obtained from the
Department of Finance showed today.  One-month implied volatility for the peso, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, fell 20 basis points
to 5.10 percent.  The yield on the government’s 5.75 percent bonds due August
2037 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.19
percent, according to noon fixing prices from the Philippine
Dealing & Exchange Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
