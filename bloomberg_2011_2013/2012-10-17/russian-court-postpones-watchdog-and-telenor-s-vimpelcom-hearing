A Russian court today postponed a
hearing with the country’s Anti-Monopoly Service against
Norwegian operator  Telenor ASA (TEL)  to Nov. 27, said Andrey Bykasov,
a Telenor spokesman in Moscow.  Russia’s anti-monopoly regulator wants to annul deals that
earlier this year boosted Telenor’s holdings in Amsterdam-based
mobile operator  VimpelCom Ltd (VIP) , which has large assets in Russia.  The Nordic region’s biggest phone company and Russian
billionaire Mikhail Fridman’s Altimo have been fighting since
February for influence over VimpelCom, which also owns assets in
Italy,  Africa  and Asia. Altimo owns 41.9 percent of the voting
shares, while Telenor controls 43 percent.  “Telenor has never expressed the intention to control
VimpelCom bypassing Russian laws,” Bykasov said by e-mail. “We
are still open to an out-of-court solution of the dispute and
will continue the dialogue” with  Russia ’s antitrust regulator.  Ukrainian billionaire Viktor Pinchuk’s 6 percent stake in
VimpelCom may be converted into voting shares starting this
week. Russia’s antitrust watchdog has proposed that Altimo and
Telenor buy Pinchuk’s stake jointly to end the feud, Vedomosti
reported Oct. 4.  Telenor spokesman Tor Odland said in an e-mail that the
court’s decision was not a surprise for Fornebu, Norway-based
Telenor, because the regulator has said it would propose an
adjournment to allow for a possible settlement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
