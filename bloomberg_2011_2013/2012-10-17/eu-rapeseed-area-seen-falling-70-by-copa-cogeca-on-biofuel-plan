Rapeseed planting in the European
Union may plunge 70 percent if plans to limit the bloc’s usage
of biofuels made from crops take effect, farming lobby Copa-
Cogeca said.  A European Commission proposal today for a 5 percent limit
on use of biofuels from arable crops means farmers may grow the
oilseed on about 2 million hectares (4.9 million acres), the
Brussels-based group said in an e-mailed statement. That
compares with about 6.7 million hectares now, it said. The plan
would eliminate  food  crops in biofuels after 2020.  The proposal would “have a severe impact on farmers’
income,” Copa-Cogeca Secretary-General Pekka Pesonen said in
the statement. It also may reduce livestock feed supplies
because byproducts from making biofuels can be fed to animals,
he said.  Phasing out biofuels also may hurt the EU trade balance and
harm employment, Pesonen said.  Europe ’s biofuels industry is
worth about 14 billion euros ($18.4 billion) and is a source of
100,000 jobs, he said. The proposal still needs approval by the
EU’s 27 national governments and the European Parliament.  Rapeseed for delivery in November recently slipped 0.1
percent to 473 euros a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in Paris. The
most-active contract reached 463.25 euros, the lowest level
since June, on Oct. 3. Prices are up 7.9 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
