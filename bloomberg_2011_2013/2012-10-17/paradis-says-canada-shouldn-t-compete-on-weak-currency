Canadian manufacturers should take
advantage of the increased purchasing power from a strong
currency to grow their businesses, Industry Minister Christian
Paradis said.  “Canadian manufacturers know that competitiveness based on
a low dollar is artificial,” Paradis said in the text of a
speech he’s giving today in Hamilton, Ontario. “A high dollar
brings challenges but it also brings new opportunities, new
purchasing power, and – played right – a strategic advantage.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
