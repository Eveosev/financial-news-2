Former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
 Paul Volcker  said the successful ringfencing of banks’
operations is very difficult to maintain and financial
institutions will seek to unwind separations over time.  “Based on the American experience, the concept that
different subsidiaries of a single commercial banking
organization can maintain total independence either in practice
or in public perception is difficult to sustain,” Volcker said
in comments submitted to the U.K. parliament’s Commission on
Banking Standards.  Attending a hearing of the panel in London today, Volcker
said the recommendations of Britain’s Independent Commission on
Banking may be eroded by financial institutions looking to take
advantage of “exceptions” in the proposals. The
recommendations include having lenders insulate consumer units
from investment banking operations.  “I understand the need for exceptions, but that gives the
leverage,” Volcker told lawmakers at the hearing. “Once you do
this, have these exceptions, the banks will say, ‘let’s make
this exception a little bigger, this is a little awkward.’”  He said the rules “tend to be permeable over time.”  “In my experience they tend to break down over time
because pressures from the institution itself,” Volcker said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
