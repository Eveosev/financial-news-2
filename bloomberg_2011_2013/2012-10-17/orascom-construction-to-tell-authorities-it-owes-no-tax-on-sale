Orascom Construction Industries (OCIC) ,
 Egypt ’s largest publicly traded company, will tell the
authorities next week that it has no unpaid tax, said investor
relations manager Omar Darwazah.  OCI was indirectly accused by President Mohamed Mursi in an
Oct. 6 speech of avoiding tax on the 8.8 billion-euros ($11.5
billion) sale of its cement unit to  Lafarge SA (LG)  in 2007, two
months after listing it on the Cairo bourse. The company said
the profit is exempted from tax under Egyptian law. OCI is also
bidding for power and steel contracts in Iraq and Egypt.  “This is the first year after the 2003 war, in which
you’re really seeing significant infrastructure spending in
Iraq,” Darwazeh said in a telephone interview. “ Iraq  and Saudi
Arabia are key markets for us.”  The company expects to complete the separation of its
construction and fertilizer units in November, Darwazah said.  OCI’s share price rose 2.1% to 271.1 pounds at the market
close in Cairo, extending a 35% rise for the year. Egypt’s EGX30
Benchmark Index has increase 61% in the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
