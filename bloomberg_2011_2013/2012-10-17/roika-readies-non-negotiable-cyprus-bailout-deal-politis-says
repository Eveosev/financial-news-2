The so-called troika that oversees
euro-area bailouts is preparing a non-negotiable aid agreement
for Cyprus even as the Cypriot government rushes to hammer out
its own proposal, Politis reported.  The troika, comprised of officials from the European
Commission, the  European Central Bank  and the  International
Monetary Fund , wants to impose across-the-board cuts in Cypriot
public payrolls, the Nicosia-based newspaper reported today
without saying where it got the information.  The troika mission will return to Cyprus early next week,
Politis said.  Spokespeople for the government couldnâ€™t immediately be
reached for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
