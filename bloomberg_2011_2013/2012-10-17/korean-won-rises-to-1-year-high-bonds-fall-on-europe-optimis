South Korea’s won strengthened to an
almost one-year high and bonds fell as optimism  Spain  is moving
closer to receiving a bailout ahead of a meeting of European
leaders supported demand for riskier assets.  Germany  is open to Spain seeking a precautionary  credit
line  from the region’s rescue fund, two senior coalition
lawmakers said yesterday. European Union leaders hold a summit
in Brussels starting tomorrow. The dollar index retreated for a
second day after data showed U.S. industrial output expanded a
0.4 percent last month, beating the 0.2 percent gain forecast in
a Bloomberg survey. The  Kospi (KOSPI)  index of shares rose following the
biggest gain in a month in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  “With the U.S. stock moves positive and a weakening of the
greenback, the won will face appreciation pressure again,” said
Lee Jin Ill, a Seoul-based currency trader for Hana Bank.
“Still, there is caution the government may intervene to smooth
currency gains, so steep appreciations may be limited.”  The won advanced for a fifth day, the longest winning
streak in a month, gaining 0.3 percent to 1,104.23 per dollar as
of 9:16 a.m. in  Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency touched 1,102.50 earlier, the strongest level since
0ct. 31, 2011. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, slipped 23 basis
points, or 0.23 percentage point, to 5.79 percent.  The yield on the 3.25 percent notes due June 2015 climbed
three basis points to 2.81 percent, a three-week high, Korea
Exchange Inc. prices show. The one-year interest-rate swap
advanced two basis points to 2.83 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
