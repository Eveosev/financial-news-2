India ’s 10-year bond yields held at
a one-week low on optimism the central bank will buy government
debt in the market to boost cash in the banking system and
counter slowing economic growth.  Lenders  borrowed  862.6 billion rupees ($16.3 billion) from
the monetary authority’s overnight repurchase window today, the
most this month, according to  Reserve Bank  of India data. Asia’s
third-largest  economy  grew 5.5 percent in the three months
through June, after expanding 5.3 percent in the previous
quarter, the least since 2009.  “There is some speculation the RBI will resume buying
government securities pretty soon to support growth,” said
Arvind Chari, a senior  fund manager  at Quantum Asset Management
Co. in Mumbai. “That’s keeping bonds supported.”  The yield on the benchmark 8.15 percent notes due June 2022
held at 8.15 percent in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s
trading system.  Chari predicted the central bank will buy as much as 500
billion rupees of notes before the end of the financial year in
March. The Reserve Bank has purchased 820 billion rupees of
 government securities  so far this fiscal year.  The one-year interest-rate swap, derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell one basis
point to 7.61 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
