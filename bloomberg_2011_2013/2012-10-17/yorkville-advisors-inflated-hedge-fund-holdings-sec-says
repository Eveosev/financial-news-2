Yorkville Advisors LLC and two of
its top officials were sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission for allegedly inflating the value of securities held
in  hedge funds  managed by the firm.  Yorkville, its founder and president, Mark Angelo, 40, and
Chief Financial Officer Edward Schinik, 47, reported inflated
values for convertible debentures, convertible preferred stock
and promissory notes held by the hedge funds since at least
2008, the SEC claimed in a complaint filed today in  Manhattan 
federal court.  Yorkville, a  Jersey City , New Jersey-based investment
adviser, made more than $10 million in fees from the
overstatements, according to the SEC. Yorkville also misled
investors about its risky and illiquid investments from April
2008 to January 2010, the SEC said.  The agency is seeking disgorgement of unspecified gains to
Yorkville, civil penalties and an order barring the defendants
from violating securities laws in the future.  A call to Yorkville seeking comment on the SEC allegations
wasnâ€™t immediately returned.  The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Yorkville
Advisors LLC, 12-CV-7728, U.S. District Court, Southern District
of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
