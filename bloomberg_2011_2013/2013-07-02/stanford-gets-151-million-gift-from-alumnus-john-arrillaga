Stanford University  is getting a $151
million gift from alumnus John Arrillaga, the school’s largest
donation from an individual living person.  The undesignated gift will be used over time to support a
variety of university projects, Stanford, which is located near
 Palo Alto , California, said today in a  statement .  Arrillaga, a billionaire real estate developer, came to
Stanford in 1955 on a basketball scholarship. His previous
donation of $100 million in 2006 was the school’s biggest gift
from a single living donor at that time, and several buildings
and facilities on campus bear his name.  To contact the reporter on this story:
