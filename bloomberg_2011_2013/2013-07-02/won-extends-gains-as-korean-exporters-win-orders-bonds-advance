The won halted its longest run of
gains in two months on speculation importers bought dollars
after the South Korean currency rallied 2.6 percent over the
previous five days. Government bonds advanced.  The won slipped 0.2 percent to 1,134.03 per dollar in
 Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It rose 0.3
percent to 1,129.5 earlier, the strongest level since June 18.
The currency has weakened 6.1 percent this year.  Exports fell 0.9 percent in June from a year earlier,
compared with a 3.2 percent advance in April and the median
estimate for a 0.1 percent increase in a Bloomberg survey,
official data showed yesterday. Samsung Heavy Industries Co.
received an 825.5 billion won ($728 million) contract for a
semi-submersible rig and Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine
Engineering Co. got a 469.6 billion won order for two ships, the
companies said in separate filings.  “Importers are pursuing dollars to pay the bills, which
must have offset the amount of the dollars sold by heavy
industry companies from the orders abroad,” said Jude Noh,
chief currency trader at Suhyup Bank in Seoul. “It’s a thin
market today, the currency’s movement may be limited in either
direction.”  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a report yesterday that
South Korean exports are likely to recover in the coming months,
while renewed weakness in the yen could hurt some industries,
especially automobiles, auto parts, steel and machinery.  One-month implied volatility in the won, a gauge of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options, fell
58 basis points, or 0.58 percentage point, to 10.48 percent, the
data show. This was the sixth day of decline.  The yield on the 2.75 percent government bonds due June
2016 fell six basis points to 2.94 percent, prices from Korea
Exchange Inc. show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
