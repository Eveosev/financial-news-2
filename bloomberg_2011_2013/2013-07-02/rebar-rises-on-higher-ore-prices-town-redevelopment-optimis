Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  rose, heading for the highest close in five weeks, as
iron ore prices climbed and policies to redevelop shantytowns
boosted optimism for construction.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange gained 0.7 percent to 3,559 yuan ($581) a metric ton at
11:35 a.m. local time, set for the highest closing price since
May 24. Futures fell 7.2 percent last quarter, the most since
the three months ended in September.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port in  China 
gained for the third day yesterday, adding 0.3 percent to
$116.90 a dry ton, the highest level since June 21, according to
The Steel Index Ltd. The raw material is a key ingredient for
steel production. China may release details of policies to
redevelop shantytowns in the second half of this year, China
Securities Journal reported on June 27.  “Sentiment is improving,” Zheng Ge, an analyst at Wanda
Futures Co., said today by phone from Beijing. “The market
seems to have stabilized somewhat after the cash crunch in the
past week and turned its focus to the possible shantytown
development and the demand outlook.”  The average  spot price  for rebar in China was little
changed at 3,357  yuan  a ton yesterday, according to data from
Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
