Coffee exports from  Peru , the third-largest grower in South America, sank 31 percent in the first
five months of the year as buyers turn to rival producers
including  Brazil , an industry group said.  From Jan. 1 to May 30, shipments dropped to 450,350 bags
from 650,353 a year earlier, Eduardo Montauban, head of the
nation’s Chamber of Coffee and Cocoa Exporters, said today in a
telephone interview from  Lima .  “We have a big problem with the weak Brazilian real, which
is making their coffees more attractive,” Montauban said.  In the past 12 months, the currency of Brazil, the world’s
biggest coffee producer and exporter, has depreciated 13 percent
against the dollar, and is on pace for the third annual decline,
the longest slump since 2002, as  South America ’s biggest economy
is seen heading into recession by Nomura Holdings Inc. The
Peruvian sol fell 5 percent against the greenback in the past
year.  Brazilian coffee exports jumped 24 percent to 2.083 million
bags in June from a year earlier, the country’s Trade Ministry
said yesterday. From January to May, total shipments surged 17
percent from a year earlier, according to data from the nation’s
council of green coffee exporters, or  Cecafe . This year,
Brazilian farmers will harvest record output for the low-yielding half of the biennial harvest, Conab, the government’s
crop-forecasting agency projects.  Peruvian growers may produce 4.5 million bags in 2013, down
10 percent from a year earlier, as farmers battle leaf rust, a
fungus that curbs productivity, the chamber estimates.  Colombia 
is the second-largest grower in South America. A bag weighs 60
kilograms, or 132 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
