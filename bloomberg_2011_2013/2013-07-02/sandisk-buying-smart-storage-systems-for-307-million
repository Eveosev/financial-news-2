SanDisk Corp. (SNDK) , a maker of  flash
memory  for mobile devices, agreed to acquire Smart Storage
Systems for about $307 million, gaining technology that improves
the performance of chips.  The transaction has been approved by the boards of both
companies and is expected to close in August, Milpitas,
California-based SanDisk said today in a statement. About 250
employees from Smart Storage will join SanDisk.  SanDisk Chief Executive Officer Sanjay Mehrotra has been
using acquisitions -- including the purchases of FlashSoft and
Pliant Technology Inc. -- to add technology that makes the chips
that store data in phones, tablets and some computers faster and
more energy-efficient. Smart Storage generated sales of about
$25 million in the fiscal quarter ended in May.  “SanDisk is excited to build upon its leadership position
with its fourth acquisition in the enterprise storage market,”
Sumit Sadana, executive vice president and chief strategy
officer at SanDisk, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
