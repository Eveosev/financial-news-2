A Russian judge found newspaper
tycoon  Alexander Lebedev  guilty of punching property developer
Sergei Polonsky on national television and sentenced the former
KGB agent to 150 hours of community service.  Lebedev, who served in the Soviet Embassy in London during
the  Cold War , faced as many as five years in prison over the
2011 incident until prosecutors dropped the more serious charge
of hooliganism last month.  “The verdict will be appealed,” Lebedev told a Moscow
courthouse packed with reporters and television cameras today.
“I insist on my innocence.”  Lebedev has called the case against him political
retaliation for his funding of  Novaya Gazeta , a Moscow-based
newspaper that investigates corruption and is critical of
President  Vladimir Putin . Lebedev also finances the U.K. Evening
Standard and Independent newspapers, which are run by his son
Evgeny, who was in court today.  The investigation into Lebedev’s attack on Polonsky during
a talk show began in September 2011, days after then-Prime
Minister Putin branded Lebedev’s actions “hooliganism” at a
meeting with his All- Russia  People’s Front. Lebedev has said his
personal fortune has fallen to several hundred million dollars
from more than $2 billion since the case was opened.  Lebedev has said crooked businessmen in collusion with
public officials have “embezzled and siphoned off” at least
$700 billion from Russia during the past 15 years, citing data
from the Web-based Tax Justice Network.  To contact the reporter on this story:
