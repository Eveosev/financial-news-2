Roche Holding AG (ROG)  said it bought
Constitution Medical Investors Inc., a U.S. blood-testing
company, for $220 million plus payments related to development
of products.  CMI, based in Boston, Massachusetts and created and funded
by private-equity company  Warburg Pincus  and CMI’s management,
will serve as a ’’center of excellence’’ in the field of
hematology within Roche’s diagnostics unit, the Basel,
Switzerland-based company said today in a  statement .  CMI makes the Bloodhound system, a product that tests blood
samples for diseases that’s fully automated and replaces several
work stations with a single unit. Roche said the blood-testing
market was worth more than $2 billion in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
