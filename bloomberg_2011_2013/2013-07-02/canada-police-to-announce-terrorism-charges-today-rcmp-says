Canadian federal police said they
will announce terrorism charges later today in British Columbia.  The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said the charges will be
announced at a press conference in Surrey, near Vancouver, at 2
p.m.  New York  time today.  The notice didn’t give further details on the types of
charges, and the RCMP didn’t immediately respond to a telephone
message left at their national headquarters in Ottawa by
Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
