The  New York Islanders  will place
goaltender Rick DiPietro on waivers and buy out the remainder of
the former No. 1 draft pick’s contract for $24 million over the
next 16 years,  Newsday of New York reported .  DiPietro, 31, will get a compliance buyout, meaning the
$1.5 million the Islanders will pay him annually through 2029
won’t count against the National Hockey League team’s salary
cap, the newspaper said, citing General Manager Garth Snow.  DiPietro was selected by the Islanders with the first
overall pick in the 2000 NHL draft and signed a 15-year, $67
million contract with the team in 2006.  DiPietro ends his Islanders career with a 130-136 record.
He was limited to a total of 50 games over the past five seasons
because of injuries and a loss of playing time. He played in
three games last season, going 0-3 with a 4.09 goals against
average before being sent to Bridgeport of the American Hockey
League.  To contact the reporter on this story:
