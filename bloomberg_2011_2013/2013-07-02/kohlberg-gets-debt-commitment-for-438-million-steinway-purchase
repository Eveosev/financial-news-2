Macquarie Group Ltd and General
Electric Capital Corp. are providing financing to support
Kohlberg & Co.’s $438 million acquisition of  Steinway Musical
Instruments Inc. (LVB) , owner of the 160-year-old piano maker.  The private equity firm will contribute a portion of cash
to back the transaction, the company said today in a regulatory
filing. There’s a termination fee of as much as $13.35 million.  Steinway agreed to be taken private following 17 years as a
publicly traded company. Under terms of the agreement, a
Kohlberg affiliate will tender for all of the company’s
outstanding shares, according to a statement yesterday.  The deal includes a 45-day period in which Waltham,
Massachusetts-based Steinway can solicit other proposals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
