U.S. banks may face  capital
requirements  that exceed the so-called Basel III minimum when
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. considers a new proposal
next week.  The FDIC -- one of three agencies that must approve the
rules cleared today by the  Federal Reserve  -- added a vote on
“enhanced supplementary  leverage ratio  standards” to its July
9 meeting  agenda .  Basel III, the  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ’s
latest set of global standards, requires banks to hold loss-absorbing capital equal to 3 percent of total assets, known as a
leverage ratio. The U.S. is considering doubling that
requirement for its largest lenders, people familiar with the
talks have said.  Andrew Gray , an FDIC spokesman, declined to comment on the
details of the proposal. FDIC Vice Chairman  Thomas Hoenig  has
repeatedly called for a ratio of 10 percent tangible equity to
tangible assets.  The FDIC will consider Basel III as an “interim final
rule” rather than as a final rule as the Fed did, according to
the agenda. Gray said the agency is doing so in order to move
the other rules forward while leaving the process open-ended as
a new leverage ratio rule is considered. U.S. Comptroller of the
Currency  Thomas Curry , who also must approve Basel III, said in
a statement today that he would do so next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
