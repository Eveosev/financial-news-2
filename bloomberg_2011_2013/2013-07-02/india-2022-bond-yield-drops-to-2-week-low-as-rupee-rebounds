The yield on Indian bonds due 2022
slid to the lowest level in almost two weeks as a rebound in the
rupee tempered concern inflation will quicken.  The currency has climbed 2.6 percent from an all-time low
of 60.765 per dollar reached on June 26. A weaker currency
increases the cost of imported goods, fueling consumer prices.
International investors  pulled  more than $5 billion from local
debt in June, exchange data show, as the rupee lost 4.9 percent
in the biggest decline since May 2012.  “The rupee’s rebound is helping ease worries about
inflation,” said Srinivasa Raghavan, Mumbai-based executive
vice president of treasury at Dhanalaxmi Bank Ltd. “A
strengthening of the rupee beyond the 59-per-dollar level will
provide a psychological boost to bond markets.”  The yield on 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 slid four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.6 percent as of
9:27 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. That’s the lowest level since June 19. The rate climbed
18 basis points last month, the most since the securities were
issued in June 2012.  The rupee fell 8.6 percent in the quarter through June, the
most since 2011, as U.S. policy makers signaled they may rein in
stimulus measures, which have boosted dollar supply, should the
 U.S. economy  perform in line with central bank estimates. The
currency rose 0.32 percent today to 59.331.  Reserve Bank  of  India  Governor Duvvuri Subbarao kept the
repurchase  rate  steady at 7.25 percent at the latest policy
meeting on June 17, citing inflation risks, even after  wholesale
prices  rose the least since 2009 in May. India’s monetary-policy
stance will be determined by the evolution of economic growth,
inflation and the balance of payments in the months ahead, the
central bank said in a statement the same day.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, dropped two
basis points today to 7.52 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
