Japanese  stocks  rose, with the  Topix (TPX) 
index capping the biggest four-day rally since April, as the yen
weakened after U.S. manufacturing expanded more than expected.
 Tokyo Electric (9501)  Power Co. surged by its daily limit.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , a carmaker that gets 31 percent of
sales in  North America , increased 2.8 percent. Tokyo Electric,
the utility at the center of the 2011 nuclear disaster, jumped
19 percent on a report it will apply to restart reactors. Power
producers led gains as all 33 Topix subsectors climbed. Sharp
Corp., an unprofitable TV maker, soared 10 percent.  The Topix increased 1.8 percent to 1,171.84 at the close in
Tokyo, with volume 22 percent below the 30-day average. The
gauge climbed 9.6 percent over the past four trading days, the
most since April 8. The  Nikkei 225  Stock Average added 1.8
percent to 14,098.74.  “Earnings at Japanese companies are likely to beat
estimates because their yen forecasts are pretty conservative,”
said Kuninobu Takeuchi, Tokyo-based executive portfolio manager
at DIAM Co., which oversees more than $124 billion globally.
“The yen comes under selling pressure when risk sentiment
improves globally.”  Today’s advance pares the Topix’s losses from an almost
five-year high on May 22 to 8.2 percent. The gauge is up 36
percent this year amid optimism  Japan  may beat deflation and
achieve sustainable growth.  Bullish Bets  Investors using borrowed money to trade Japanese stocks are
the most bullish since 2000, signaling expectations the rally
will continue. The number of Japanese shares bought through
margin accounts that profit when stocks rise outnumbered those
that make money during declines by about 7 to 1, the highest for
13 years, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.4
percent, after the gauge climbed 0.5 percent yesterday. The
 Institute for Supply Management ’s manufacturing index increased
to 50.9 in June from 49 in May, beating the 50.5 forecast in a
Bloomberg survey. A reading above 50 signals expansion.  The yen touched 99.91 per dollar today, the weakest since
June 5. A falling yen boosts the value of overseas earnings at
Japanese companies when repatriated.  Companies in the Bank of Japan’s Tankan survey, which was
released yesterday, forecast the yen to average 91.20 per dollar
in the fiscal year ending March 2014, compared with a projection
of 85.22 in the previous report.  Carmakers Advance  Makers of cars and electric appliances provided the most
support to the Topix. Toyota added 2.8 percent to 6,230 yen.
 Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , a carmaker that gets 73 percent of its
revenue abroad, gained 4.4 percent to 428 yen.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the
world’s biggest camera maker, advanced 3.7 percent to 3,360 yen.
 Sony Corp. (6758) , which gets 68 percent of sales overseas, climbed 2.5
percent to 2,186 yen.  Tokyo Electric, also known as Tepco, jumped 19 percent to
623 yen for the biggest gain on the Nikkei 225. Japan’s public
broadcaster NHK said the utility will apply to restart reactors
at its Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant. Tepco said it would
make the application in a statement after the market closed.  Sharp soared 10 percent to 436 yen for the second-biggest
gain on the Nikkei 225. The company said it is considering
building a 38-megawatt solar power station in Hokkaido.  GPIF Results  Fast Retailing Co. (9983)  gained 4.1 percent to 35,300 yen. After
the market closed,  Asia ’s biggest apparel maker reported June
same-store sales at Uniqlo Japan outlets increased 20.5 percent
from a year ago.  Also after the close, Japan’s Government Pension Investment
Fund, the world’s largest manager of retirement savings, said it
posted a record 10.2 percent annual return as stocks surged and
a weaker yen boosted the value of overseas assets.  The Topix will rise to 1,270 by year-end, according to 18
analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News . It’s the first time the
median estimate has fallen since the rally in Japanese equities
began in mid-November.  The gauge has swung an average of about 3 percent daily
since May 22. The measure’s 30-day historic volatility closed at
43.22, its highest since the 2011 earthquake. The Topix  traded 
at 14.8 times average estimated earnings, compared with 14.7 for
the S&P 500 and 12.8 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
