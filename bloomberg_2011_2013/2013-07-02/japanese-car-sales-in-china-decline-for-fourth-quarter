Japan ’s three biggest automakers saw
their combined sales in China fall for a fourth consecutive
quarter, showing they’re still recovering from the backlash
against Japanese brands.  Total sales at  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  and
Honda Motor Co. last quarter declined 4.9 percent from a year
earlier, according to monthly figures released yesterday.
Individually, Nissan and Honda saw lower deliveries, although
their drops narrowed, while Toyota posted a 0.6 percent gain.  The results illustrate how Japanese automakers continue to
struggle winning back customers after last year’s territorial
dispute between China and Japan led to demonstrations at major
cities across China. Toyota last year reported its first sales
decline since at least 2002 and pushed back a plan to make the
country its third million-unit market.  “Their total sales will recover in the second half,” said
Vivien Chan, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Oriental Patron
Holdings. “In terms of market share, however, it will be
impossible for the Japanese cars to rebound to the 22 percent
level they had before the island disputes” as competitors offer
or plan to sell more affordable, smaller cars, Chan said.  Toyota’s recovery has been the fastest, with sales rising 9
percent in June, the second straight monthly gain. For the year,
the maker of the Corolla and Camry sedans is targeting
deliveries to rise about 7 percent to 900,000 in the country
this year.  Nissan and Honda’s June sales in  China  fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
