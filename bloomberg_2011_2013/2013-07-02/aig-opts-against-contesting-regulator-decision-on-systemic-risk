American International Group Inc. (AIG) ,
the insurer that repaid a U.S. bailout last year, won’t
challenge a decision by regulators that it poses a potential
risk to the economy.  AIG opted against filing an appeal with the U.S. Treasury
Department over its proposed status as a systemically important
financial institution, Jon Diat, a spokesman for the New York-based insurer, said in an e-mail today.  “AIG welcomes supervision by the  Federal Reserve , and is
already working closely with the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York as our regulator,” Diat said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
