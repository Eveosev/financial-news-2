Singapore deployed anti-pollution
craft and patrol vessels to clean up an  oil spill  after two bulk
carriers collided.  About 100 metric tons of fuel oil leaked after a bunker
tank on the South Korean-registered Oriental Pioneer was damaged
in the collision with the Bahamas-registered Atlantic Hero, the
Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore said in a statement.
The accident occurred about 6.6 kilometers (4 miles) south-west
of Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal, the MPA said today.  No one was injured, and port operations and traffic in the
Strait of Singapore are unaffected, the authority said. The two
vessels are now anchored.  “Good progress has been made in containing and cleaning up
the oil spill,” the MPA said in a  second statement . “There has
been no further spillage of  fuel oil  from Oriental Pioneer.”  A total of 11 craft and 100 personnel have been deployed to
clean up the oil spill. The authority is coordinating the action
with other government agencies and ship owners, it said in the
statement.  The Oriental Pioneer is beneficially owned by Tokyo-based
 Nippon Yusen K.K. (9101) , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
company’s South Korean subsidiary is aware of the incident and
is preparing for repairs to the ship, Jiro Tanida, a spokesman
for  Nippon Yusen  said by telephone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
