U.K. construction  expanded for a
second month and at the fastest rate since May 2012 as new
orders rose to the highest in 13 months.  An index of activity rose to 51 in June from 50.8 in May,
Markit Economics and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and
Supply  said today in London. Economists forecast 51.2, according
to the median of 16 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. That’s
above the 50 mark that divides expansion from contraction.  “Although the construction sector faces a long and fragile
road to recovery, June’s survey highlights a nascent turnaround
in optimism about future output,” said Tim Moore, Senior
Economist at Markit.  The survey follows reports yesterday showing manufacturing
also strengthened in June and the housing market picked up.
Governor  Mark Carney  leads his first  Bank of England  policy
meeting this week, when officials will probably maintain their
 bond-purchase program  at 375 billion pounds ($571 billion).  The pound weakened against the dollar after the report, and
traded at $1.5199 as of 9:51 a.m. London time, down 0.1 percent
from yesterday.  The increase in construction in June was led by housing as
activity in commercial and civil engineering stabilized, ending
several months of decline, Markit said.  Markit’s manufacturing index climbed to a two-year high of
high of 52.5 in June. A gauge of service companies to be
published tomorrow will probably show a drop to 54.5 from 54.9,
according to a survey of 33 economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
