Poland’s Agnieszka Radwanska defeated
Li Na to set up a semifinal against Germany’s Sabine Lisicki at
the Wimbledon tennis tournament.  Radwanska, the fourth seed, won 7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 6-2 in a
rain-disrupted match. Radwanka, who lost last year’s final to
 Serena Williams  of the U.S., won in her eighth match point
during a 10-minute last game under the closed roof on Centre
Court.  Lisicki defeated Kaia Kanepi of Estonia 6-3, 6-3. The
German, who knocked out top-seeded Williams in the last round,
also reached the semifinals at the All England Club in 2011.  In the other half of the draw, France’s Marion Bartoli
leads Sloane Stephens of the U.S. 5-4 in the first set on Court
1, which is under rain covers. The quarterfinal between 2011
champion Petra Kvitova of the  Czech Republic  and Kirsten
Flipkens of  Belgium  was delayed by Radwanska’s match.  To contact the reporter on this story:
