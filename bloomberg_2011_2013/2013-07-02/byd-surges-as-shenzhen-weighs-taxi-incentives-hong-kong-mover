BYD Co. (1211) , the Chinese electric
carmaker partly owned by  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A) , rose the most in two months in Hong Kong as Shenzhen City
said it is considering incentives to promote electric vehicles.  The carmaker gained as much as 13 percent and was trading
11 percent higher at 28.50 yuan as of 14:51 p.m., poised for the
biggest one-day gain since April 26. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang
Seng Index fell 0.3 percent.  The southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, where BYD is based,
is considering incentives to encourage taxi operators to replace
their 15,000 vehicles with electric cars, Lu Xiangzhen, director
assistant of the city’s Energy Efficiency and New Energy
Vehicles Pilot City Leading Group Office, said in a phone
interview today. The news is fueling the shares, said  Janet Lewis , a Hong Kong-based analyst at  Macquarie Research .  Given that the life cycle of a taxi is usually five years,
replacements will occur gradually and taxi operators will make
the final decision on whether to make the switch, said Lu, who
declined to provide details on the government incentives being
considered.  The taxi orders in Shenzhen would be “a drop in the ocean
for sales” at BYD, said Lewis, who rates the shares
underperform.  BYD also won a contract to produce as many as 25 all-electric buses for the Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority as part of a $30 million clean-air bus
technology pilot project, according to a June 27 statement.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
