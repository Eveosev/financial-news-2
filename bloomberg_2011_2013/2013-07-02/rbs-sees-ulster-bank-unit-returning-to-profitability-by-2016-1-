(Corrects date in headline.)  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc 
expects its Ulster Bank unit, which has cost 14.3 billion pounds
($21.7 billion) to rescue, will return to profit by 2016 as the
Irish lender eliminates jobs and closes branches.  RBS forecasts that the core Ulster Bank operation will
reach break-even by the end of 2014 after closing as many 63
branches, according to a  presentation  to analysts published on
the Edinburgh-based bank’s website today. Ulster Bank, which is
in the process of eliminating about 950 jobs, will shrink its
workforce to between 4,000 and 4,500 full-time employees by 2016
from 5,800 at the end of 2012, it said.  Ulster Bank has been unprofitable and received multiple
capital injections from its parent since the collapse of
Ireland’s real-estate bubble in 2008. The bank, once Ireland’s
third-largest consumer lender, was split in 2009 into a core
bank and non-core bank, which includes assets the lender plans
to sell over time.  “The macro-economic environment across the island of
Ireland has shown improvement,” Ulster Bank Chief Executive
Officer Jim Brown said in slides prepared for the presentation
due to start at 3 p.m. today. “Investor confidence in Ireland
is returning.”  RBS said revenue at Ulster Bank is “broadly stable,” with
impairment losses falling 154 million pounds in the first
quarter from the year-earlier period. It didn’t give a profit
forecast for 2016.  To contact the reporters on this story:
