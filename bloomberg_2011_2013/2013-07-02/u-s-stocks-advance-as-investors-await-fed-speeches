U.S. stocks gained, led by financial
and consumer companies, as investors awaited data on factory
orders and speeches from Federal Reserve officials  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index added 0.4 percent to
1,621.44 as of 9:51 a.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average increased 46.9 points, or 0.3 percent, to 15,021.86.  The S&P 500 has dropped 3.3 percent since May 21, the day
before Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke signaled the central bank
could scale back asset purchases if the economy improves in line
with forecasts. The benchmark equity gauge climbed 0.5 percent
yesterday after data showed manufacturing grew faster than
forecast in June and construction spending increased.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
