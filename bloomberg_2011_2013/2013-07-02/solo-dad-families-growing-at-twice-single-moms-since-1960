The number of single-father
households in the U.S. has grown nine-fold over the last half-century, increasing at twice the pace of those led by single
mothers, according to a study released today.  Almost 2.7 million U.S. households with children, or 1 in
every 12, were headed by an unmarried dad in 2011, the Pew
Research Center said in its analysis of census data. Only
297,000, or 1 in 100, were led by fathers in 1960.  The analysis underscores social changes that have swept the
U.S. in the last half-century, including rising divorce rates
and growing numbers of children raised by families that don’t
include two married people.  “The role of fathers has evolved, and the public now
acknowledges their importance not only as breadwinners, but also
as caregivers,” the Washington-based research organization said
in its report.  Slightly more than 9 of 10 U.S. households with children
were headed by married couples in 1960. The figure had fallen to
two-thirds by 2011, the latest year for which data are
available.  Single fathers typically have less education and income
than married dads, Pew said in its report. Like single moms,
they also are younger and more likely to be minorities.  Unmarried dads reported median household income of $40,000,
about $14,000 more than single mothers. The figure is still 57
percent of the median $70,000 earned by married fathers.  Poverty Common  About 1 in 4 of single dads are poor, compared with 43
percent of unmarried mothers living in poverty. About 8 percent
of married fathers are poor, Pew reported.  Single dads also were less likely to have a bachelor’s
degree. About 17 percent of unmarried fathers reported earning
college degrees, less than half of the 40 percent of married
dads with that level of education.  Census data show 1.6 million single fathers, about 59
percent, aren’t living with a partner. The Pew report
highlighted differences between those fathers and dads who are
cohabitating.  Single fathers who weren’t living with a partner reported
median annual income of $43,000, while unmarried, cohabitating
fathers made $38,000. One in 5 single fathers living alone with
a child was poor. Thirty percent of dads with a partner fell
below the poverty line.  To contact the reporter on this story:
