The pound strengthened for the first
time in five days against the euro after an industry report
showed U.K. construction expanded in June, adding to signs
Britain’s economy is gaining momentum.  Sterling rose from the lowest level in more than a month
versus the shared currency after data yesterday showed
 manufacturing  grew last month.  Mark Carney  began as governor of
the  Bank of England  yesterday and will lead his first policy
meeting this week. Carney must focus on boosting lending to help
maintain the recovery, the British Chambers of Commerce said.
U.K. gilts rose after the Debt Management Office sold 3.5
billion pounds ($5.31 billion) of 10-year securities.  “The data seems to be providing a little bit of a shield
to a dip lower for now,” said Lee McDarby, head of dealing on
the corporate and institutional treasury desk at Investec Bank
Plc in  London . “There’s some nervousness before Carney’s first
policy meeting this week so you won’t see any big shifts in the
pound before that.”  The pound appreciated 0.1 percent to 85.79 pence per euro
as of 12:25 p.m. London time after weakening 1.2 percent in the
previous four days. Sterling slipped 0.2 percent to $1.5186
after falling to $1.5166 on June 28, the lowest since May 31.  An index of construction rose to 51 in June from 50.8 the
previous month, Markit and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing
and Supply  said in London. Economists predicted 51.2, according
to a Bloomberg survey. A reading above 50 signals expansion.  The pound has strengthened 4.1 percent in the past three
months, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that
track 10 developed-market currencies. The euro gained 5.2
percent and the dollar climbed 3.4 percent.  Policy Meeting  Carney will lead his first meeting of the Monetary Policy
Committee this week and all 44 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey forecast the central bank’s  bond-buying target  will be
kept at 375 billion pounds. The majority of the nine-member MPC
have voted to keep the target unchanged since August.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., among those predicting no change,
said it is “more likely than not” the MPC will issue a
statement after the meeting, something it typically doesn’t do.  “The recovery in the U.K. is gaining traction,” Anders Vestergaard Fischer, an analyst at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Copenhagen
wrote in a report today. Carney’s arrival won’t change the
balance of opinion among the policy makers immediately, he
wrote, but the pound “is vulnerable to expectations of
aggressive monetary policy. If MPC policy changes more than
expectations it could be a trigger for renewed weakening.”  The British Chambers of Commerce said in a survey in London
its measures of sales at manufacturers and service companies
rose in the second quarter. Still, the report also showed
declines in some investment gauges and “weak cashflow.”  Growth ‘Warning’  “They are a warning that economic growth could be slow,
and a reminder that a sustained upturn cannot be taken for
granted,” BCC Director General John Longworth said in a
statement. “For these reasons, business access to finance, and
working capital in particular, must be assured.”  The benchmark 10-year gilt yield fell four basis points to
2.38 percent. The 1.75 percent security maturing in September
2022 rose 0.315, or 3.15 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to
94.85. The rate on two-year gilts dropped two basis points to
0.36 percent.  The U.K. sold securities due in September 2023 at an
average yield of 2.584 percent, the highest at an auction since
September 2011 and up from 2.365 percent at a previous sale on
June 11. That compares with a  record-low  1.719 percent set at a
sale on July 12, 2012.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 3.2 percent this year
through yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.
German bonds dropped 1.6 percent and Treasuries declined 2.8
percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
