IC Companys A/S (IC)  rose for a sixth day
in Copenhagen trading, the longest winning streak in five
months, after Nordea Bank AB recommended investors buy the stock
because of its  dividend  yield.  IC rose as much as 1.2 percent to 125 kroner. The stock
also traded at that price at 11:14 a.m. in the Danish capital
with volume at 153 percent of the three-month daily average.  IC is a  relatively cheaper  investment than its Swedish
peer, Stockholm-based  Hennes & Mauritz AB (HMB) , which has become too
expensive after recent advances, Nordea said today. Copenhagen-based IC, which is  Denmark ’s largest listed clothing company,
has paid dividends for its last three fiscal years and on May 15
reported rising revenue and net income.  “IC Companys is well underway to improving profitability
and there are prospects of higher dividends in coming years,”
Nordea in Copenhagen said in a note to customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
