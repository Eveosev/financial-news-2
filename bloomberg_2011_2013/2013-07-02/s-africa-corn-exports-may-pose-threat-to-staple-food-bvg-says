South Africa, the continent’s largest
producer of corn, may run out of the yellow variety if exports
of the grain rise further, pushing up the cost of white corn,
one of the nation’s staple foods, BVG (Pty) Ltd. said.  The nation shipped 79,055 metric tons of yellow corn in the
week to June 28, including 54,112 tons to  Japan  and 23,043 tons
to  Taiwan , the Pretoria-based South African Information Service
said in a statement on its website. The country has exported
377,367 tons of the grain since the start of the marketing year
in May, according to Sagis. That compares with 18,333 tons in
the same period a year earlier and 413,152 tons for the entire
2013 marketing year that ended in April.  “If we continue at this brisk pace, we will definitely
have shortages of yellow corn,” Brink van Wyk, a trader at BVG,
said by phone from  Pretoria . “What we have available this year
for exports of yellow corn is 1 million tons.”  South Africa uses yellow corn as animal feed, while meal
made from the white variety is one of the country’s dietary
staples. The country will probably consume 4.54 million tons of
yellow corn and could supply 5.74 million tons in the marketing
year through April, the Grain and Oilseeds Supply and Demand
Estimates Committee said in its first-ever report, released on
June 28.  “We either need to export less, or we use more white corn
for cattle feed, or we import more yellow corn,” Van Wyk said.  Forecast Lowered  The Crop Estimates Committee cut its forecast for corn
output by 0.6 percent to 11.38 million tons, it said in a June
25 report. South Africa produced 12.8 million tons in 2010, the
biggest harvest since 1982.  Grain SA, the biggest representative of farmers in South
Africa, says the nation has 620,000 tons of yellow corn, also
known as maize, available for export.  “If the average weekly export tempo of the past eight
weeks should be maintained, the remaining export maize of
321,688 tons should be exported within the next nine weeks,”
the organization said in an e-mailed newsletter yesterday.
“This means that the yellow maize available for export should
be completed by the end of August. South Africa can potentially
experience a shortage in yellow maize for the biggest part of
this marketing year.”  Yellow corn for delivery in September, the most active
contract, declined 0.4 percent to 2,176 rand ($220) a ton, the
lowest since May 21, by the close on the South African Futures
Exchange. The white variety fell 0.6 percent to 2,236 rand a
ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
