Doric Lease Corp. and Nimrod Capital
LLP sold shares backed by leasing revenue from Airbus SAS A380
superjumbos operated by Emirates, the third such investment
asset tied to the world’s largest passenger plane.  The companies issued shares in Doric Nimrod Air Three Ltd.
in  London  today at 100 pence, with an initial market value of
220 million pounds ($334 million), according to a statement. The
shares opened at 107.5 pence and rose as high as 109.5 pence.  DNA3 is the duo’s third offering of shares tied to the
ownership and stream of leasing revenues for the double-decker
A380. Investors buying DNA3 will get quarterly dividends of 8.25
percent a year, based on the 100-pence issue price. Once the
plane comes off lease, they will get the proceeds when the
aircraft is sold.  Doric, a Dublin-based aircraft lessor, and Nimrod, a
specialist investment fund, have built a business on financing
A380s for airlines including Emirates and  Singapore Airlines
Ltd. (SIA)  Doric Nimrod sell shares backed by the value of the A380
based on monthly leasing revenue and for the plane’s residual
value at the end of the leasing term.  The four A380s financed by DNA3 are scheduled for delivery
between this September and November 2013 and will be on lease
for terms of as long as 12 years, said Irena Badelska, a partner
in Doric Lease Corp. Partners.  Doric Lease Corp. has already done 18 sale-and-leaseback
transactions with Emirates and  Singapore . Last month, Doric
placed an order for 20 A380s at the  Paris Air Show . It plans to
lease the planes to airlines and then refurbish them when leases
end to find second lessors or purchasers.  Doric and Nimrod have also financed aircraft through bonds.
In mid 2012, Doric Nimrod Air Finance Alpha Ltd. sold $587.5
million in debt secured by four A380s operated by Emirates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
