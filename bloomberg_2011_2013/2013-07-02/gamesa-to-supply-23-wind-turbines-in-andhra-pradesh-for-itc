Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA (GAM)  will
supply 46 megawatts of wind power to a unit of India’s ITC Ltd.
as the Spanish turbine manufacturer seeks to grow in the nation
seeking alternatives to fossil fuels.  Gamesa will install 23 machines each with a 2-megawatt
capacity to ITC Paperboards and Specialty Papers Division for
the plant at Tagguparthi in  Andhra Pradesh , the Zamudio-based
company said today in a statement. The project will be
commissioned early next year.  Gamesa has installed more than 830 megawatts in India, as
Asia’s second-biggest energy consumer targets doubling
renewable-energy capacity to about 60,000 megawatts by 2017 to
help reduce blackouts and diversify generation away from fossil-fuel power plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
