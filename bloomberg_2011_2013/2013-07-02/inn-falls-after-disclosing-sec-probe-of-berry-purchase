Linn Energy LLC (LINE) , the oil and natural
gas partnership that agreed to buy Berry Petroleum Co. in
February, fell the most in at least three years after disclosing
a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry of the
transaction.  Linn, based in Houston, dropped 9.6 percent to $30.10 at
8:24 a.m. before regular trading began in  New York . As of
yesterday, Linn had declined 5.5 percent this year.  Commission staff notified the partnership of a “private,
non-public inquiry” of Linn and affiliate  LinnCo LLC (LNCO) , the
companies said in a statement after markets closed yesterday.
Investigators want documents preserved that relate to the Berry
deal as well as hedging strategies and certain financial
measures, according to the statement.  “The SEC has stated that the fact of the inquiry should
not be construed as an indication that the SEC or its staff has
a negative view of any entity, individual security,” Linn said
in the statement. “The impact of the inquiry on the timing of
LinnCo’s proposed merger with  Berry Petroleum Co. (BRY)  is difficult
to predict.”  Berry agreed to be bought by Linn for $2.42 billion in
stock. The companies, which are cooperating with the probe, said
they remain committed to closing the transaction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
