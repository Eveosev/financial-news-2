Japanese  stock futures  rose as the
yen weakened beyond 100 per dollar for the first time in a month
and investors awaited reports on U.S. jobs to assess the outlook
for monetary stimulus.  American Depositary Receipts  of Nissan Motor Co., a
carmaker that gets more than 70 percent of revenue outside
Japan, gained 0.8 percent. ADRs of  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker
that gets about 80 percent of sales abroad, climbed 0.7 percent
as the weaker yen lifted the profit outlook for the nation’s
exporters. Those of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest
mining company, sank 1.4 percent as metals prices retreated.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
September closed at 14,170  Chicago , up from 14,130 at the close
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 14,200 in
Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index retreated 0.5 percent and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
fell 0.2 percent. Futures on Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained
0.2 percent.  “Markets are pretty mixed, with all eyes on the non-farm
payrolls data due at the end of the week and the impact that
could have on the tapering talk,” Chris Green, director of
economics and strategy at First NZ Capital Ltd., said by phone
from Auckland. The weaker yen is “a stimulatory factor for that
economy” in Japan.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the benchmark regional
equities gauge, retreated 8.9 percent through yesterday from the
closing level on May 20, which was the highest since June 2008.
That left the gauge trading at 12.7 times average estimated
earnings compared with 14.6 for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) 
and 12.7 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed after the measure yesterday slid 0.1 percent. Data today
from the ADP Research Institute may indicate American companies
increased employment in June.  Investors will watch the monthly U.S. labor report later
this week for further signs of economic strength. Employers in
the U.S. probably created 165,000 jobs in June, almost the same
as in May, according to the median forecast of economists in a
Bloomberg survey ahead of July 5 figures from the Labor
Department. The  unemployment rate  probably fell to 7.5 percent,
matching April’s four-year low.  The London Metal Exchange LMEX Index of industrial metals
dropped 0.4 percent yesterday.  Futures contracts on the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index
of mainland Chinese companies trading in  Hong Kong  advanced 0.2
percent. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. dropped 2.2 percent in New York
yesterday. Non-manufacturing and services reports are scheduled
for today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
