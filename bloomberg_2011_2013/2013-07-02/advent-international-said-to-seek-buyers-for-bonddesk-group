Buyout firm Advent International
Corp. is seeking buyers for BondDesk Group LLC, a debt-trading
technology firm it bought in 2006 for an undisclosed amount,
people with knowledge of the matter said.  BondDesk could fetch $200 million, said the people, who
asked not to be identified because the matter is private.
Advent, based in  Boston , is working with investment bank
Broadhaven Capital Partners LLC to solicit buyers for BondDesk,
the people said.  London Stock Exchange Group Plc and Ipreo Holdings LLC are
among the potential buyers that have expressed interest in the
company, the people said. MarketAxess Holdings Inc. and Tradeweb
Markets LLC also may bid for the company, they said.  Advent, BondDesk and Broadhaven didn’t return calls seeking
comment. Representatives for London Stock Exchange, MarketAxess
and TradeWeb declined to comment on their interest in BondDesk.
A representative for Ipreo didn’t immediately respond to a
request for comment.  BondDesk, founded in 1999, offers fixed-income trading
execution and analysis services and is the largest retail bond-trading venue in the U.S., according to its  website .  The company has about $20 million in annual earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, said one of the
people familiar with the situation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
