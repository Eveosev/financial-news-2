Brazil ’s industrial production fell
in May more than economists forecast, as the government’s fight
against inflation complicates its strategy to revive growth.
Swap rates fell.  Industrial output fell 2 percent in May after jumping a
revised 1.9 percent in April, the national statistics agency
said today in Rio de Janeiro. The fall was greater than every
forecast from 29 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, whose median
 estimate  was for a 1.1 percent decline. Production rose 1.4
percent from the  year  before.  President Dilma Rousseff’s administration has slashed
payroll taxes for dozens of industries and cut electricity rates
in a bid to boost production. At the same time, the central bank
started raising rates in April to tame inflation above the upper
range of the target. Amid slower-than-forecast growth, industry
 confidence  in June fell to its third-lowest level since 2009.  Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2015, the
most traded in Sao Paulo today, fell 10 basis points, or 0.10
percentage point, to 9.80 percent at 9:05 a.m. local time. The
real weakened 0.5 percent to 2.2404 per U.S. dollar.  Industry contracted 0.3 percent in the first quarter from
the previous three months. That drag on Brazil’s economy caused
total gross domestic to grow 0.55 percent, below the 0.9 percent
median economist forecast in a Bloomberg survey. Economists
surveyed by the central bank reduced their 2013 growth forecast
for the seventh straight week to 2.4 percent.  Brazil’s central bank accelerated the pace of interest rate
increases in May in a bid to slow inflation that is hurting
economic growth. The bank, which has increased its Selic rate by
75 basis points since April, will hold its next monetary policy
meeting on July 9-10.  Consumer price inflation accelerated to 6.67 percent in the
year through mid-June, exceeding the top range of the central
bank’s target of 4.5 percent plus or minus two percentage
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
