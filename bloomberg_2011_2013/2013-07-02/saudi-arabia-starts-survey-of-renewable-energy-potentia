Saudi Arabia started a program to
assess its potential for generating renewable energy, part of an
effort to lure $109 billion for building a solar industry that
will free up more of its crude oil for export.  King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy, the
organization responsible of devising the kingdom’s strategy,
will install at least 70 stations nationwide to measure the
ability to produce electricity from the sun, wind, geothermal
and waste sources, according to a statement issued yesterday and
carried by official Saudi Press Agency. The agency known as Ka-Care said 10 stations already have been installed.  The findings will be published in a national atlas by year
end, which will guide investors and researchers studying where
to place generation plants.  Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest crude oil exporter, will
present a national policy statement on renewable and nuclear
power generation later this year as it seeks to diversify energy
resources, Khalid Al Sulaiman, vice president at Ka-Care, said
in January.  The kingdom has said it plans to attract about $109 billion
to create a solar industry that will generate a third of its
electricity by 2032, or about 41,000 megawatts. It’s part of a
wider program to generate 54 gigawatt from different sources
including nuclear.  Currently, about 3 megawatts of solar power plants are
working in Saudi Arabia, a capacity that trails  Egypt ,  Morocco ,
Tunisia,  Algeria  and the U.A.E., according to Bloomberg New
Energy Finance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
