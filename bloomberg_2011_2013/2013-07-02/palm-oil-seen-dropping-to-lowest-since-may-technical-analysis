Palm, the most-consumed cooking oil,
will probably decline 4.5 percent in the next two weeks to the
lowest level since May as it remains in a downward trend,
according to a  technical analysis  by RHB Investment Bank Bhd.  The most-active contract on Bursa Malaysia Derivatives may
drop to 2,250 ringgit ($710) a metric ton, a support level that
the commodity couldn’t break in late April and early May, said
analyst Mohammad Ashraf Abu Bakar, who has predicted prices for
the past five years. The oil’s long-term trend is definitely
still down, Mohammad Ashraf said by phone in Kuala Lumpur.  Support levels refer to prices at which buy orders may be
clustered. Futures ended at 2,250 ringgit on May 6, the lowest
price at close for the most-active contract since December. Palm,
used in foods and fuels, has dropped 3.4 percent this year and
was at 2,355 ringgit at the market’s midday break.  “Weakness is reinforced by the longer-term, negative death
cross of the 50-day and 200-day moving average lines,” he said.
“The death cross is a long-term indicator. The series of lower
highs that started in April 2012 is still not broken. That’s the
clearest indicator that things are really still weak.”  Palm oil’s 50-day moving average has been below the 200-day
moving average since June 29, 2012. The pattern, known as a
death cross, is a bearish indicator to investors and analysts
who study charts of trading patterns and prices to predict
changes in a security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
