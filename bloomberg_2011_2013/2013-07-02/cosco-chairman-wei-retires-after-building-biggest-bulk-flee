Wei Jiafu retired as chairman of
 China  Ocean Shipping Group Co. after expanding the company’s
commodities fleet into the world’s largest as demand for iron-ore imports fueled a boom that led to a glut of vessels.  Wei was replaced by Ma Zehua, the group’s president,
according to a  statement  posted on the Cosco Group’s website
today. Li Yunpeng took over for Ma and the appointments were
announced July 1, it said, without saying why the changes were
being made. Two calls to the company were not returned.  Cosco Group is restructuring assets of its listed flagship
 China Cosco (1919)  Holdings Co. to help it return to profit after two
straight annual losses. Freight rates for hauling containers,
commodities and crude have slumped because of weak demand and
excess capacity.  Under Wei’s helm, Cosco’s fleet expanded to 800 ships,
according to the company’s website. The chairman also helped
build a group that has interests in 32 ports and 1.8 million
containers globally, along with shipyards and rig-makers that
hold one-third of China’s offshore equipment orders.  Cosco controls or owns stakes in six listed companies.
China Cosco, which runs container and commodities transportation
business, is its biggest listed firm. The group’s fleet of
commodities ships is the world’s largest according to a Nippon
Yusen K.K. annual report citing data from industry researcher
Clarkson. NYK has the second-biggest bulk fleet.  China Cosco rose 1.8 percent to HK$3.46 at the close in
 Hong Kong  trading today. The stock has slumped 43 percent over
the past two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
