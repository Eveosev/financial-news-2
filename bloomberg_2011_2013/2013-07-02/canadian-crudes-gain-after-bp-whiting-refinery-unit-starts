Canadian oils strengthened on the
 spot market  after  BP Plc (BP)  finished starting a new crude unit at
its Whiting, Indiana refinery, increasing demand.  The restart of the unit brings the plant back to its
nameplate capacity of 413,000 barrels a day, company said
yesterday. The refinery will initially process mostly light
sweet grades, the company said, and will increase heavy, sour
crude to about 80 percent of its total after new coking and
hydrotreating units are commissioned.  Western Canadian Select, a blend of heavy oil including
bitumen from the oil sands, strengthened by $2.15 a barrel to a
$12.10 discount to WTI at 1:33 p.m. mountain time, according to
Calgary oil broker Net Energy Inc.  Syncrude, a light crude from  oil-sands  bitumen processed in
an upgrader, strengthened $3.25 a barrel to a premium of $6.25
to WTI, according to Net Energy.  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  restarted its Wood Buffalo pipeline that
connects to Edmonton-bound Line 18, the Waupisoo line, the
pipeline company based in Calgary said in a release today. It
and other lines connecting oil sands production with storage in
Hardisty, Alberta, and Edmonton were closed after a leak on June
22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
