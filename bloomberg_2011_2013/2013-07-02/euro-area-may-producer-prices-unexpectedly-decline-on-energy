Euro-area  producer prices 
unexpectedly decreased for a second month in May, as the 17-nation currency bloc struggled to emerge from a  record-long
recession .  Factory-gate prices in the 17-nation economy slipped 0.1
percent after a 0.2 percent annual decrease in April, the
European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today.
Economists had projected that prices would remain stable,
according to the median of 16 estimates in a  Bloomberg News
survey. (EUPPEMUY)   Energy prices fell 1.8 percent in May, a third straight
decline, and intermediate goods dropped 0.5 percent. Prices of
capital and durable consumer goods rose 0.6 percent and 0.7
percent, respectively, the same pace as in April.  Euro-area annual consumer-price growth has been below the
ECB’s 2 percent ceiling for five months, though the rate
increased to 1.6 percent in June. The ECB will keep its
benchmark rate at a record low of 0.5 percent when the Governing
Council meets on July 4, according to the median of 62
economists in a separate  Bloomberg survey .  To contact the reporter on this story:
