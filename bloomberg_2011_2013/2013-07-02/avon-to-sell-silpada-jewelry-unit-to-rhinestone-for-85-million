Avon Products Inc. (AVP) , the door-to-door
cosmetics retailer, agreed to sell its Silpada Designs jewelry
unit to Rhinestone Holdings Inc. for $85 million in cash, about
one-seventh the amount it paid to buy the company in 2010.  The agreement also includes an earn-out payment of as much
as $15 million if Silpada meets certain profit targets over a
two-year period, the New York-based makeup company said today in
a statement. Avon said it expects to take an $80 million pretax,
noncash charge on the estimated loss from the sale. Rhinestone
is a new company created by Silpadaâ€™s founders.  Avon said in February it was looking for alternatives for
the unit as Chief Executive Officer Sheri McCoy tries to
stabilize the company after four years of declining profit.  Avon bought Silpada in July 2010 for about $650 million to
broaden its product line. Sales at the time of purchase were
about $230 million a year,  compared  with $155 million last year.
McCoy, a former Johnson & Johnson executive, took over last year
from  Andrea Jung .  Avon rose 0.7 percent to $21.29 at the close in  New York .
The shares have gained 48 percent this  year .  To contact the reporter on this story:
