Crude oil options volatility rose for
the first time in six days as the underlying futures advanced on
speculation that U.S. stockpiles fell last week.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
August, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options, was 20.12 percent at 3:40 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , up from 19.44 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery gained
$1.61, or 1.6 percent, to $99.60 a barrel on the Nymex, the
highest settlement since May 3, 2012. The futures rose before a
government report that may show stockpiles fell to the lowest
level since May 31.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
August $90 puts, which fell 3 cents to 7 cents a barrel on
volume of 4,922 lots. August $105 calls were the second-most
active, up 10 cents to 20 cents a barrel on volume of 2,501
contracts.  Puts, or bets that prices would fall, accounted for 57
percent of electronic trading volume. In the prior session,
bearish bets and calls, which are bets that prices would rise,
were evenly split on volume of 97,441 contracts.  August $90 puts were the most-active options traded
yesterday as they dropped 13 cents to 10 cents a barrel on
volume of 7,103 contracts. August $83 puts slid 1 cent to 2
cents a barrel as 4,685 lots exchanged hands.  Open interest was highest for September $85 puts, with
39,406 contracts. Next were December $105 calls with 37,649 and
December $80 puts with 36,786.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
