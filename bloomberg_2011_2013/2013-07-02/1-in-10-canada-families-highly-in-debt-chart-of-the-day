Canada ’s housing boom created a
nation where more than one in 10 families are what the central
bank calls “highly indebted,” data from polling firm Ipsos
Canada shows.  The share of households with debts greater than or equal to
250 percent of gross income reached a record 13.5 percent last
year, according to Ipsos, the CHART OF THE DAY shows.  “Looking at these figures one would think Canadians are
accumulating debt at an alarming rate,” said Michael Hsu, vice
president at Ipsos in Toronto. Still, he said “most of the debt
Canadians are accumulating is going into real estate and right
now the real estate market is holding up quite nicely.”  The  Bank of Canada , which calls households owing more than
250 percent of their gross income “highly indebted,” said last
month that household imbalances remain the biggest domestic risk
to the financial system. Deputy Governor Timothy Lane said June
26 that while there has been a moderation in household
imbalances, policy makers are still “watching very closely.”  Ipsos data shows the percentage of heavily indebted
Canadians had fallen to 11.4 in the first quarter. Another more
widely tracked sign of consumer finances also shows that debt
levels peaked last year and have begun to decline.  Statistics
Canada  reported the ratio of  household debt  to disposable income
fell to 161.8 percent in the first quarter from a record 162.8
percent in the third quarter of last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
