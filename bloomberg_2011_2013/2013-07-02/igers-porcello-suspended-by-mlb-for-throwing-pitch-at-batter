Detroit Tigers pitcher Rick Porcello
was suspended for six games for intentionally throwing a pitch
at Ben Zobrist of the Tampa Bay Rays two days ago,  Major League
Baseball  announced.  Porcello also was fined an undisclosed amount, Joe
Garagiola, Jr., MLB’s senior vice president of standards and
operations, said today in a news release.  Zobrist was hit in the wrist by a pitch in the first inning
of the Rays’ 3-1 win June 30 at Tropicana Field in St.
Petersburg, Florida. A day earlier, Detroit’s  Miguel Cabrera 
yelled at the Tampa Bay dugout after Rays reliever Fernando
Rodney threw a high-and-tight fastball before striking out
Cabrera.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
