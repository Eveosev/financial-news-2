Kedco Plc (KED) , an Irish developer, agreed
to build a biomass-fed power station in southwest  England  after
the U.K. guaranteed electricity prices from clean-energy plants.  Kedco will construct the heat and power plant for property
developer London & Devonshire Trust Ltd., the Cork-based company
said today in a statement. The facility will have a capacity of
as much as 10 megawatts.  The government, seeking to spur expansion of clean energy
to meet demand while cutting emissions, published proposals last
week for guaranteed electricity prices. New biomass heat and
power plants may receive 120 pounds ($182) a megawatt-hour,
according to the plans under the  Electricity Market Reform .  Kedco, whose plant would be built in an energy park being
developed by London & Devonshire in Plymouth, expects to sign a
binding contract with the trust this month. The park already has
a grid connection, it said.  Kedco is also in “advanced” talks to build a similar
facility in Ireland and expects to sign an agreement before the
end of July, according to the statement.  The U.K. Department of Energy and Climate Change estimates
that bioenergy plants that use feedstocks such as wood chips and
organic waste may meet 8 percent to 11 percent of the nation’s
primary energy demand by 2020. Bioenergy accounted for the
largest share of renewable-power output at the end of the first
quarter, reaching 34 percent, government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
