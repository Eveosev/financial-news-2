Barry Diller  agreed to pay $480,000
to settle a U.S. Federal Trade Commission complaint that he
broke antitrust law by purchasing almost a million shares of
Coca-Cola Co. without reporting the transactions.  Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act, Diller should
have notified the FTC and the Justice Department when he bought
the stock between 2010 and 2012, according to statements from
both agencies today. The law also requires a waiting period
before a transaction over the reporting threshold closes so one
of the agencies can evaluate whether it hurts competition.  Diller, co-creator of the Fox Broadcasting Co. and the
billionaire chairman of  IAC/InterActiveCorp (IACI) , bought 120,000
shares of Atlanta-based Coca-Cola on Nov. 1, 2010, according to
the FTC complaint, which was filed today in federal court in
 Washington  by the  Justice Department .  As a result of those purchases, he held voting shares worth
more than $63.4 million, which was the reporting threshold under
Hart-Scott-Rodino at the time, the FTC said.  Between Nov. 1, 2010, and April 26, 2012, Diller bought an
additional 605,000 shares of Coca-Cola voting securities and on
April 27, 2012, he acquired 264,000 more shares, the FTC said.
He failed to make the necessary filings for all of the
transactions, according to the agency. Diller subsequently made
corrective filings.  The FTC took action after warning Diller in 1998 to
establish an effective compliance program after he failed to
report the acquisition of voting shares in CitySearch Inc. The
FTC declined to seek penalties at that time.  Kent Landers , a spokesman for Coca-Cola, said in an e-mailed statement that Diller is a “valued member” of the board
and his status remains unchanged.  Justine Sacco, a spokeswoman for New York-based
IAC/InteractiveCorp., declined to comment on the FTC penalty.
