Talvivaara Mining Co. (TALV)  slumped the
most in almost three months in London trading after saying
prices were weak in the first half, forcing the Finnish nickel
company to fire as much as 40 percent of its employees.  The producer tumbled 14 percent by the close in the city,
the steepest drop since April 8, to 11 pence, the lowest level
since the company sold shares to the public in May 2007.  Talvivaara may fire or temporarily lay off as many as 250
of its 600-strong workforce to cut costs, the Espoo-based
company said today in a statement. Nickel for three-month
delivery on the London Metal Exchange declined 12 percent in the
first half from a year earlier to average $16,207 a metric ton.  “The company has invited representatives of employee
groups to co-operation consultations in accordance with
applicable law,” the nickel mining company said.  Talvivaara, which suffered from excess water at the site of
its open-pit mine and an 11-day leak of waste water in November,
was forced to cut its output forecast three times last year to
about 13,000 tons from an initial estimate of as much as 30,000
tons. In April, it completed a 261 million-euro ($340 million)
underwritten rights offer to stave off default and bankruptcy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
