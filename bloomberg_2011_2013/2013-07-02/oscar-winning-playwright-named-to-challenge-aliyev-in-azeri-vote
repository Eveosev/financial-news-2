An Oscar-winning screenwriter will
challenge Azeri President  Ilham Aliyev  as the representative of
the country’s secular opposition in an October election.  The National Council of Democratic Forces nominated Rustam
Ibrahimbayov, 74, as its single candidate, the opposition
alliance announced today at a meeting in the capital Baku. The
candidacy needs approval of the Central Electoral Commission.  If elected, Ibrahimbayov has pledged to oversee a peaceful
transition to democracy within two years and ensure free and
fair polls in which he won’t seek re-election, according to a
statement released by the alliance in May.  Aliyev, 51, who took over from his father in disputed
presidential elections 10 years ago, was nominated last month
for a third term by the ruling New Azerbaijan Party, or YAP. The
Caspian Sea nation, where  BP Plc (BP/)  and partners have invested more
than $40 billion in energy projects since 1994, is the largest
oil producer in the former  Soviet Union  after Russia and
 Kazakhstan .  Ibrahimbayov, also known as Ibragimbekov in the Russian
transliteration of his name, co-wrote with Nikita Mikhalkov the
1994 film “ Burnt by the Sun ” that won an Oscar for best
foreign language movie.  To contact the reporter on this story:
