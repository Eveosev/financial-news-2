London Mayor  Boris Johnson  said he’s
open to fracking for gas under the U.K. capital to meet the
city’s demand for energy.  The headroom between  energy supply  and demand will drop to
just 2 percent in two years, which will force some industries
not to operate at peak times, Johnson said in a letter published
in the Times newspaper today.  “If reserves of shale can be exploited in London we should
leave no stone unturned, or unfracked, in the cause of keeping
the lights on,” Johnson wrote. “It’s time for maximum boldness
in energy supply.”  The U.K. government said June 27 that shale-gas fields in
northern  England  are potentially big enough to meet demand for
47 years. The countryside south of Britain’s biggest city may
hold 700 million barrels of recoverable shale oil, according to
the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, which involves blasting
a mixture of water, sand and chemicals underground, is
nonetheless a controversial drilling technique because of
concerns that it will damage the landscape and contaminate
groundwater.  To contact the reporter on this story:
