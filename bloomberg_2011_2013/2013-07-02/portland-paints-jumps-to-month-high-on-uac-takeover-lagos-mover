Portland Paints & Products Plc (PORT) , a
Nigerian company that manufactures paints, rose for a fourth day
to the highest in a month after  UAC of Nigeria Plc  said it
acquired a majority stake.  The stock advanced 10 percent to 4.95 naira by the close in
Lagos, the commercial capital, its highest since June 4,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. UAC acquired 51 percent
of  Portland  Paints, UAC spokesman Mike Asuquo said by phone. A
statement will be issued later today, he said.  “The acquisition is expected to boost Portland’s
operations,” Raheem Mohammed, the chief executive officer of
Lagos-based Kundila Finance Ltd., said in a telephone interview
today. Brokers were notified of the deal this morning, he said.  Portland’s profit in the first quarter dropped to 20.1
million naira ($125,359) from 75 million naira a year earlier,
the Lagos-based company said on May 2.  No one was immediately available to comment, according to a
woman who answered a call made to Portland’s Lagos office. The
shares have risen 14 percent this year while the Nigerian Stock
Exchange All-Share  Index (NGSEINDX)  gained 28 percent.  UAC’s stock fell a second day, dropping 0.2 percent to 54
naira. The stock has gained 54 percent in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
