Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  extended Robert Iger’s tenure as chief executive officer of the world’s largest
entertainment company to June 2016, a move that delays his
planned succession for 15 months.  Iger, 62, will now continue in both the chairman and CEO
positions until mid-2016, Burbank, California-based Disney said
yesterday in a statement. He was scheduled to relinquish the CEO
title on April 1, 2015.  The company cited a need for continuity and Iger’s record
of success. Analysts have long cited Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo and Tom Staggs, who leads the parks and resorts division,
as probable replacements. The two swapped roles in January 2010.
This year, Disney amended its compensation plan to allow for the
creation of new senior positions, such as chief operating
officer or president.  “Either the company does not believe that its current CEO
candidates are ready to take the helm or that Iger is not ready
to step down,” said Janna Sampson, co-chief investment officer
of Lisle, Illinois-based OakBrook Investments LLC, which
reported owning about 441,000 Disney shares as of June 28. “I
doubt the Disney board would force Iger to retire at this point
anyway.”  The company credits Iger’s leadership for total shareholder
return of 193 percent during his tenure, beating the 54 percent
return for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, said Orin Smith,
Disney’s independent lead director. Iger was named CEO in
September 2005.  Disney Shares  “Now, Disney will continue to have the full benefit of Mr.
Iger’s leadership as CEO and chairman for the duration of his
tenure,” Smith said in the statement, adding that the board
remains focused on finding a successor when his term ends.  Disney fell 1.1 percent to $63.26 at the close in New York.
The shares have risen 27 percent this year, compared with 13
percent for the S&P 500.  The company said there will be no change to the terms of
Iger’s compensation. He earned $40.2 million in 2012 in total
compensation last year, based on regulatory reporting rules, a
20 percent increase from the previous year. The company says 92
percent of his 2012 pay was performance based.  To contact the reporter on this story:
