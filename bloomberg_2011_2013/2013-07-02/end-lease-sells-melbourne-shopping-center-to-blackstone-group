Lend Lease Group agreed to sell a
mall it runs in  Melbourne  to  Blackstone Group LP (BX) , the world’s
biggest manager of alternative assets. Lend Lease shares jumped
the most in two-and-a-half years.  Blackstone paid A$360 million ($332 million) for
Greensborough Plaza, according to a person familiar with the
transaction, who asked not to be identified as the price hasn’t
been disclosed. Vivienne Bower, a spokeswoman at Sydney-based
Lend Lease, confirmed the sale by the developer’s unlisted
Australian Prime Property Fund Retail of the mall 23 kilometers
(14 miles) northeast of Melbourne’s center.  Blackstone, which is seeking $4 billion for its first Asian
property fund, had $1.5 billion as of June 7, according to a
letter sent to investors on June 12. The New York-based firm is
focusing on  China ,  India , Australia and  Japan , a person with
knowledge of the plans said in December, as the Asia-Pacific
region’s economic growth attracts private-equity investors.  Blackstone’s New York-based spokesman Peter Rose didn’t
respond to phone calls and an e-mail seeking comment.  Blackstone in November bought Top Ryde City shopping center
in Sydney for A$341 million from receivers. The firm, in April
2011, bought Sydney-based Valad Property Group, which was
struggling to pay off debt, for about A$700 million.  The shares of Lend Lease, Australia’s biggest developer,
advanced the most since December 2010, closing 5.3 percent
higher at A$8.58 in Sydney. Blackstone shares slipped 0.3
percent to $20.99 at the close of trading in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
