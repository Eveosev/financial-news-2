UAC of Nigeria Plc , an investor in
foods, logistics and real-estate services, agreed to acquire 51
percent of  Portland Paints & Products Nigeria Plc. (PORT)   The deal has been approved by authorities, Mike Asuquo, a
spokesman for Lagos-based UAC, said by telephone today. No one
was immediately available to comment at Portland, which is also
based in  Nigeria ’s commercial capital.  “The acquisition provides UAC with the opportunity to
diversify its paints revenues by gaining entry into the mid-tier
decorative and marine paints market where Portland Paints has a
leading position,” Larry Ettah, chief executive officer of UAC,
said in an e-mailed statement.  UAC said May 2 that net income for the year through
December jumped to 7.1 billion naira ($44.3 million) from 3.9
billion naira a year earlier. Portland’s profit in the first
quarter dropped to 20.1 million naira from 75 million naira a
year earlier, the company said on May 2.  UAC’s stock fell a second day, dropping 0.2 percent to 54
naira. The shares have gained 54 percent this year.  Portland 
Paints rose a fourth day, advancing 10 percent to 4.95 naira,
its highest since June 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
