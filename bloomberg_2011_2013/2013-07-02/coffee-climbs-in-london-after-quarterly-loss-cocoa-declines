Robusta coffee climbed to the highest
in almost three weeks in  London  on speculation prices that fell
in the last quarter by the most since 2011 slipped too far, amid
declining stockpiles in  Europe  and high premiums in growing
nations. Cocoa slipped.  Futures tumbled 14 percent from April to June, the worst
quarterly loss since the third quarter of 2011. Stockpiles with
a valid grading certificate in warehouses monitored by NYSE
Liffe fell 1.3 percent to 119,580 metric tons in the two weeks
to June 24, exchange data showed. Beans from leading grower
 Vietnam  and third-ranking Indonesia were trading at a premium to
the exchange price last week, according to Volcafe Ltd.  “It’s still predominantly technical trade after the losses
we’ve seen,”  Andrea Thompson , the Belfast, Northern Ireland-based head of research and analysis at CoffeeNetwork, a unit of
INTL FCStone Inc., said by phone today. There’s “really light
support from the fact that certified stocks eased at the end of
last week. That would be the only support from fundamentals.”  Robusta coffee for September delivery gained 1.5 percent to
$1,811 a ton by 10:55 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London. Prices,
which gained 1.5 percent yesterday, touched $1,812, the highest
for a most-active contract since June 12. Arabica coffee for
delivery in September gained 1.2 percent to $1.2305 a pound on
ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  “The scope for downside potential is greatly reduced from
a week ago,” Thompson said, adding that the market was testing
the upside on the $1,800 a ton level. “The negative
fundamentals some say have already been factored in the price
and therefore we don’t have much further to fall.”  Indonesian Coffee  Coffee from  Indonesia  was last week at a premium of $230 a
ton to the exchange price, Volcafe, the coffee unit of
commodities trader ED&F Man Holdings Ltd. said in a report e-mailed on June 28. Beans from Vietnam were at a premium of $140
a ton, data from the trader showed. While Indonesia is gathering
its 2013-14 crop, the next harvest in Vietnam will only start in
October. Beans in the physical market trade at a differential to
the futures, which could be a premium or a discount.  “The robusta differentials have firmed in this off-season
peak and should not be weaker up until after the end of the
Ramadan, or even up to the end of August/beginning of
September,”  Rodrigo Costa , a trading director at Caturra Coffee
Corp. said in a report e-mailed yesterday. “After this, I think
the Liffe contract should suffer new selling waves.”  Cocoa for September delivery slid 0.2 percent to 1,449
pounds ($2,203) a ton in London. Cocoa for September delivery
was down 0.3 percent to $2,153 a ton in New York. Futures

past 100 days for this time of day, according to data compiled

$480.90 a ton on NYSE Liffe. Raw sugar for delivery in October
