Fresenius Medical Care AG won a U.S.
appeals court ruling today that will end a patent-infringement
claim brought against it by  Baxter International Inc. (BAX)  over
kidney dialysis machines.  The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has canceled the
Baxter patent after a review while the civil suit was still
pending, so there is no longer any basis for Baxter’s claim, the
 U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Federal Circuit ruled in
 Washington  today. The opinion was posted on the court’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
