Dialog Semiconductor Plc (DLG) , the German
maker of chips used in  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone, agreed to buy  IWatt
Inc. (IWAT)  of the U.S., gaining power management technology for
tablets and smartphones in a deal worth as much as $345 million.  Dialog, based in Kirchheim, said it will pay about $310
million in cash as well as additional revenue-based payments of
as much as $35 million in a statement to the stock exchange
today. It expects the acquisition to add to earnings per share
in the first quarter after the deal is closed.  The German company, which relies on Apple for more than
one-third of its revenue, is diversifying its product portfolio
with the purchase of IWatt, which is based in Silicon Valley,
 California . The deal gives it access to a market that may grow
to $11.5 billion by 2015, according to estimates by research
Gartner Inc., cited by Dialog in the statement.  “This acquisition underscores Dialog’s strategy to
diversify our markets and growth opportunities through select
strategic acquisitions,” Chief Executive Officer Jalal Bagherli
said in the statement.  Dialog shares rose as much as 5.8 percent and traded 3.2
percent higher at 10.10 euros as of 11:41 a.m. in Frankfurt,
valuing the company at 689 million euros ($897 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
