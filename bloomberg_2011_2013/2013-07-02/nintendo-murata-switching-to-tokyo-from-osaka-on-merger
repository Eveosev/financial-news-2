Nintendo Co., Murata Manufacturing
Co. and  Nidec Corp. (6594)  are among companies that will be switching
their main market from Osaka to Tokyo from July 16 as the two
bourses merge their cash-equities trading platforms,  Japan
Exchange Group Inc. (8697)  said today.  The three stocks will automatically be moved to the  Tokyo
Stock Exchange’s first section , according to Japan Exchange
spokeswoman Miwa Aonuma. Shares of Yahoo Japan Corp., Japan
Exchange Group and JIN Co., which are among those listed on both
Tokyo’s main market and Osaka’s JASDAQ exchange, will trade on
the TSE’s first section, Japan Exchange Group said today in a
statement.  The new bourse operator was formed this year from the
merger of Tokyo Stock Exchange Group Inc. and  Osaka  Securities
Exchange Co. There are 1,600 companies listed in Osaka,
consisting of 1,099 solely listed in the city and 501 cross-listed stocks,  according to  the OSE. A total of 5.43 trillion
yen ($54 billion) in shares was traded in Osaka in June,
compared with 1.37 trillion yen the month before,  according to 
data from the OSE.  Companies listed on both the TSE main market and Osaka’s
JASDAQ must choose between the TSE main market and TSE JASDAQ,
while shares cross-listed on the TSE Mothers and OSE JASDAQ can
select either the TSE Mothers or TSE JASDAQ, according to a
Japan Exchange statement on Jan. 30.  To contact the reporters on this story:
