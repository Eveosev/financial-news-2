Asian  stocks  rose, with the regional

two that fell. The gauge last week capped its first quarterly
slump in a year amid signs of an economic slowdown in  China  and
after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said policy
makers may start dialing down stimulus if the U.S. economy shows
sustained improvement.  “Economic fundamentals in most areas have been
improving,” said  Angus Gluskie , managing director at White
Funds Management in Sydney who helps oversee about $450 million.
“Markets have some potential to pick up from here. There’s
still a degree of nervousness out there as we’re at the juncture
when the Federal Reserve is signaling it may reduce stimulus
measures. There’s also a clear change of policy direction in
China.”  Japan ’s  Topix index  and the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock
Average both increased 1.8 percent.  Singapore ’s Straits Times

erasing earlier losses of as much as 0.8 percent. The nation’s
benchmark one-day repurchase  rate , a gauge of funding
availability in the interbank market, fell about 71 basis points
to 3.71 percent, a weighted average shows. That compares with a
record high of 13.91 percent on June 20.  “People are breathing a sigh of relief as the worst of the
volatility seems to be behind us,” said Tim Condon, head of
Asian research at ING Groep NV in Singapore. “Liquidity in
China has improved as the interbank rate is coming off highs.”  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 0.7 percent as it
resumed trading following yesterday’s holiday. South Korea’s
Kospi Index was little changed, while  Taiwan ’s Taiex index slid
0.3 percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index retreated 9.4 percent through
