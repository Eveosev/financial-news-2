A gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk
was little changed before the release of a factory-orders
report.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, increased
0.3 basis point to a mid-price of 84.7 basis points at 8:14 a.m.
in  New York , according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The
measure closed at 84.4 basis points yesterday, the lowest level
since June 18.  Investors are looking at economic indicators to gauge the
strength of the recovery and to assess companies’ ability to
repay their obligations. Factory orders in the world’s largest
economy probably increased 2 percent in May, up from 1 percent
in April, according to the median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg survey before a Commerce Department report at 10 a.m.  The credit-swaps index typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
