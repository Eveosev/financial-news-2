The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region from non-payment
dropped, according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index declined 4 basis points
to 134 basis points as of 10:19 a.m. in Sydney, according to
National Australia Bank Ltd. The gauge, on course to fall for
the first time in three days, is headed for its lowest close
since June 19, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index decreased 3 basis points to
103 as of 9:19 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. The
index is poised for its sixth consecutive decline to its least
since June 12, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill
Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan fell 1 basis point to 148.5 basis points
as of 8:46 a.m. in  Singapore , Westpac Banking Corp. prices show.
The gauge, which has ranged from 99.5 to 177.8 this year, is
also poised for its first decline in three days, according to
CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
