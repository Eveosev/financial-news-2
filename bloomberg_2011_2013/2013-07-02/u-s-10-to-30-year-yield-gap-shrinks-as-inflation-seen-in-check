The difference between 10- and 30-year Treasury yields approached the narrowest level in 17 months
on speculation inflation will hold in check as the  Federal
Reserve  reduces its efforts to spur economic growth.  The so-called  spread  was 1 percentage point. The gap was 97
basis points last week, or 0.97 percentage point, which was the
least since Jan. 3, 2012, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The longest maturities are those most influenced by
the outlook for prices in the economy. While U.S. government
securities have fallen 2.5 percent this year, Treasury Inflation
Protected Securities tumbled 8 percent, Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes show.  “The economy is not growing fast enough to bring on an
inflation acceleration,” said Marc Fovinci, the head of fixed
income in  Portland ,  Oregon , at Ferguson Wellman Capital
Management Inc., which has $3.5 billion in assets. “I certainly
wouldn’t be a holder of TIPS.”  Benchmark 10-year  yields  were little changed today at 2.49
percent as of 10 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader data. The price of the 1.75 percent note due in May 2023
was 93 19/32.  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and same-maturity TIPS, a gauge of trader expectations for consumer
prices over the life of the debt, was 2.04 percentage points.
The average over the past decade is 2.22 percentage points.  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , fell 44 percent yesterday
to $250.9 billion, the least since May 7. June’s average was
$446.2 billion.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Merrill Lynch
Option Volatility Estimate MOVE Index was 101.32 yesterday. It
climbed to 110.98 on June 24, the highest since November 2011.  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities each month to support the economy by putting
downward pressure on borrowing costs. Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said on June 19 that policy makers may begin slowing bond
purchases this year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
