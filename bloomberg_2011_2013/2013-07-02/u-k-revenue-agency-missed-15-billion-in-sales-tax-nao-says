Britain’s tax-collection agency,  Her
Majesty’s Revenue and Customs , failed to collect 9.6 billion
pounds ($14.6 billion) in  sales tax  in the year ended March,
auditors said.  The “tax gap” in value-added tax, levied on most goods
and services sold in the U.K., amounted to 10 percent of the
amount HMRC should have collected, the National Audit Office
said in a report published in  London  today. The missing VAT is
the equivalent of a third of the U.K.’s estimated 32 billion-pound tax gap, it said.  “That is a huge amount of money,”  Margaret Hodge , the
Labour Party lawmaker who chairs Parliament’s Public Accounts
Committee, said in a statement. “Yet despite some progress,
HMRC still does not comprehensively check all VAT returns and
its response to the emerging threat from online trading has
been far too slow.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
