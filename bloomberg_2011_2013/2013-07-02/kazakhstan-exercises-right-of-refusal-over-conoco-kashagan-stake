The Kazakh government will exercise
its right of first refusal and acquire the stake held by
 ConocoPhillips (COP)  in the nation’s biggest oil field, squeezing out
Oil &  Natural Gas  Corp.  The Kazakh Oil and Gas Ministry has informed ConocoPhillips
it will buy the U.S. oil company’s 8.4 percent interest in the
Caspian Sea oil project, the Astana-based ministry said today in
an e-mailed statement. State-owned KazMunaiGaz National Co. will
carry out the purchase on behalf of the government.  ConocoPhillips said in November it intended to sell its
stake in Kashagan for about $5 billion to Oil & Natural Gas,
 India ’s biggest energy explorer. Kazakh law allows the central
Asian nation to exercise an option to step in and buy that stake
in place of the Indian company.  China National Petroleum Corp. will acquire an 8.33 percent
holding in the Kashagan project from KazMunaiGaz for about $5
billion, people with knowledge of the matter said June 28.  After KazMunaiGaz completes both deals it will hold a stake
of 16.88 percent in the Kashagan project, one of the people
said.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ,  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Total SA (FP)  and  Eni
SpA (ENI)  have 16.81 percent each.  Japan ’s  Inpex Corp. (1605)  owns 7.56
percent.  The initial development of Kashagan, due to start
production in September, cost $48 billion, double early
estimates.  To contact the reporters on this story:
