Heliotrop , the French maker of
concentrating solar panels, expects to find a buyer this year
for electricity from a 40-megawatt power plant it’s developing
in northern  Mexico .  The company plans to begin construction in 2015 on the
Proyecto 1024 Soles plant in Sonora state, Paul Bellavoine, a
spokesman for Lyon, France-based Heliotrop, said today in a
telephone interview.  Heliotrop will be able to sell electricity from solar
plants in Mexico for $60 a megawatt hour in 2020, less than half
what some businesses pay for power now, he said. The closely
held company’s panels use lenses that focus sunlight on solar
cells, boosting electricity output compared to conventional
photovoltaic technology.  Heliotrop expects to deliver “hundreds of megawatts” of
panels annually to Mexican clients once Proyecto 1024 Soles is
complete, he said. The company has built several small solar
projects in  Europe  and expects to have 10 megawatts of capacity
online by the middle of next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
