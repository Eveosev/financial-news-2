U.K. stocks were little changed,
after the FTSE 100 Index yesterday rallied the most in a month,
as investors awaited reports on British construction activity
and U.S. factory orders.  The FTSE 100 Index lost 2.4 points, less than 0.1 percent,
to 6,305.38 at 8:36 a.m. in  London . The benchmark yesterday rose
1.5 percent, the most since May 28, as British manufacturing
data beat estimates. The FTSE All-Share Index was little changed
today, while Irelandâ€™s ISEQ Index added 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
