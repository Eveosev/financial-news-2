SK Hynix Inc. (000660)  fell the most in 13
months in  Seoul  after CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets advised selling
the stock on expectations memory-chip prices will drop.  Shares in the world’s second-largest maker of computer-memory chips tumbled 8.7 percent at the close, its steepest
slide since May 16, 2012. The stock is the biggest decliner in
the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index. CLSA cut SK Hynix’s rating to
sell from outperform, it said in a report today. South Korea’s
benchmark index was little changed.  Earnings will peak in the third quarter, CLSA said in the
report. Demand for dynamic random access memory chips for
personal computers is weaker than what spot prices indicate, it
said. The DRAM business accounted for about 70 percent of SK
Hynix’s total sales in the first quarter, according to Seong Ae Park, a company spokeswoman.  “Recent experience suggests it will be difficult for SK
Hynix’s stock price to increase if the spot price is falling,”
Matt Evans, a CLSA analyst based in Seoul, wrote in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
