Brazil ’s securities regulator is
investigating a $1 billion  put option  granted by billionaire
 Eike Batista  to his flagship company  OGX Petroleo & Gas
Participacoes SA. (OGXP3)   The regulator, known as CVM, requested a review of the
option announced by the crude oil producer on Oct. 24 to fund
its investments, according to a statement yesterday on the
regulator’s website, without providing reasons for the probe.  OGX has until April 30 to request that its billionaire
controller pay the put option as its  cash position  dwindles. The
company yesterday said that it may shut its only producing oil
field next year after a technical review and scrapped three
other fields. Batista has lost as much as $30 billion of his
personal wealth in the past 16 months after missed targets and
production delays at his resources and logistics startups.  “We were surprised with the announcements that the put was
not exercised as it has become more critical than ever,” Banco
Santander SA analysts Christian Audi and Vicente Falanga Neto
said in a note to clients today. “While we previously estimated
the company would run out of cash by mid-2014 (without the put),
this potential situation is now anticipated to the end of this
year.”  Fitch Ratings  last month cut OGX’s rating to CCC, or seven
levels below investment grade, citing increased uncertainty
about Batista’s ability to honor the option.  To contact the reporter on this story:
