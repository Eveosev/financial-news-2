Japan ’s Ministry of the Environment
set up a fund to invest in clean energy projects to support
regional companies and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.  The ministry has set aside 1.4 billion yen ($14 million)
for the fund for fiscal 2013, said Kazuhiro Okuma, an official
in charge of the fund. The fund will invest in projects with
private investors for as much as a half of equity.  “We want to support projects that are led by regional
companies and financial institutions,” Okuma said at a briefing
in  Tokyo  today. “It’s important to create a model for
sustainable society by promoting low carbon projects and
revitalizing local communities at the same time.”  The move came a year after Japan introduced an incentive
program for clean energy. The program has boosted solar capacity
more than any other renewable source. Solar is faster to build
than other types such as geothermal or wind, both of which must
be assessed for their environmental impact.  “There are many large-scale solar projects by big
companies but not much else is really increasing,” Okuma said.
For renewable projects that require a lot of initial investment,
regional companies tend to lack capital and local lenders do not
have much experience in  project financing , he said.  Green Finance Organization will manage the fund and pick
about five to 10 projects for the year through March 31,
according to Yoshihiro Toyofuku, the organization’s secretary-general.  To contact the reporter on this story:
