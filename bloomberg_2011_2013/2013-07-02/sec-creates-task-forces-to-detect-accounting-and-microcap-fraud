The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission has formed two enforcement task forces aimed at
rooting out improper accounting and fraud at small companies,
the agency said.  The SEC’s enforcement division also created a Center for
Risk and Quantitative Analytics to identify risks and threats
that could harm investors, the agency said in a statement today.  “By directing resources, skill and experience to high-impact areas, we will increase the potential for uncovering
financial-statement and microcap fraud early and bring more
cases aimed at deterring these types of unlawful activity,” co-director of enforcement Andrew Ceresney said in the statement.  The financial reporting task force will concentrate on
publicly filed statements, issuer reporting and audit failures,
the SEC said. The group will also focus on a review of financial
restatements and revisions. The group will be led by David Woodcock, head of the SEC’s regional office in  Fort Worth ,
 Texas , and will work in consultation with the enforcement
division’s chief accountant, according to the statement.  In fiscal 2012, the SEC brought the fewest number of
accounting-fraud cases since at least 2003.  To contact the reporter on this story:
