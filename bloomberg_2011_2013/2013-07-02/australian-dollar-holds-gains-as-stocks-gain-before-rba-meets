Australia’s dollar held its biggest
gain in more than two weeks versus the greenback as global
stocks rallied ahead of central bank policy meeting today.  Traders see a 79 percent chance the  Reserve Bank  of
Australia will refrain from cutting  interest rates  today.
Governor  Glenn Stevens  signaled at the last meeting on June 4
there is still room to reduce borrowing costs and the local
dollar remained high. The Aussie traded near the lowest in 4 1/2
years against its New Zealand counterpart.  “The RBA said last time the exchange rate remained high
considering the decline in export prices, so it will be
interesting to see whether they will simply reiterate that
message or dilute that message somewhat,” said Alvin Pontoh, a
Singapore-based Asia-Pacific strategist at TD Securities Inc.
“If they refrain from saying anything about the currency, then
the currency will bounce because that will be interpreted as the
RBA as being happy with the current  exchange rate .”  The Australian dollar was little changed at 92.40 U.S.
cents as of 10:10 a.m. in Sydney from yesterday, when it gained
1.1 percent, the biggest increase since June 13. The same day it
touched 91.10, the lowest since September 2010.  The Aussie was unchanged at NZ$1.1813. It dropped to
NZ$1.1753 on June 20, a level unseen since January 2009.
Australia’s currency bought 92.01 yen from 92.08 yesterday, when
it climbed 1.6 percent.  New Zealand’s dollar was little changed at 78.20 U.S.
cents, after yesterday rising 1.1 percent. It slid 0.1 percent
to 77.85 yen.  The  yield  on Australia’s 10-year government bond slid four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.78 percent. The
MSCI World Index of stocks gained 0.8 percent yesterday, while
the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  of U.S. shares added 0.5
percent. MSCI’s Asia Pacific Index added 0.7 percent today.  December Odds  Twenty-five of 28 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News 
expect  Governor Stevens  and his policy board to hold the
Australia’s benchmark interest rate at 2.75 percent today.
 Interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg show traders see
a 84 percent chance of a reduction by December.  “The exchange rate has depreciated since the previous
board meeting, although, as the board has noted for some time,
it remains high considering the decline in export prices that
has taken place over the past year and a half,” Stevens said on
June 4, after unexpectedly lowering borrowing costs in May.  ANZ Bank  New Zealand  Ltd. releases monthly price index of
New Zealand’s commodity exports for June at 1 p.m. in
Wellington. The RBA price index of Australian commodities
dropped 10.5 percent from a year earlier to 88.9 last month from
a revised 87.4 in May, data released on its website yesterday
showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
