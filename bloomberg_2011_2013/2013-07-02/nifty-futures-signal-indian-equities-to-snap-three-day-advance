Indian stocks declined after the
benchmark  stock index  posted its biggest three-day gain since
September 2011. Utilities and energy companies led the retreat.  The S&P BSE  Sensex (SENSEX)  retreated 0.6 percent to 19,463.82 at
close in Mumbai. The measure’s 30-day  volatility  climbed to the
highest in more than a year.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , owner of
the world’s largest refining complex, fell for the first time in
four days. Power generator  NTPC Ltd. (NTPC)  dropped 1.7 percent, ending
two days of gains.  The Sensex jumped 5.5 percent in the past three days after
the government agreed to raise natural-gas prices as part of a
policy overhaul to revive an economy that grew at a decade-low
rate of 5 percent in the year ended March. The gauge has fallen
4.1 percent from its two-year high reached on May 17 as the
prospect of reduced U.S. stimulus spurred global funds to pull a
net $1.76 billion from Indian stocks last month through June 27,
ending 12 months of buying, data from the regulator show.  “India remains an overweight position for us, however, the
short term is terribly difficult to call,” Adrian Lim, a senior
investment manager with  Aberdeen Asset Management Plc (ADN) , said in
an interview to Bloomberg TV India. “India remains one of those
markets that are prone to foreign capital movements that can be
quite dramatic.”  Reliance fell 1.6 percent to 871.85 rupees, the most since
June 20. The stock jumped 8.8 percent last week, the  sharpest 
weekly advance since the period ended Sept. 4, 2011.  Oil &
Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) , the nation’s largest state explorer, lost 1.9
percent to 321.9 rupees. The stock rallied 7.6 percent last
week, ending three straight weeks of losses.  Doubling Prices  India’s cabinet approved a gas pricing formula recommended
in December by a panel led by chief of the prime minister’s
Economic Advisory Council. The new rates, which may increase to
as much as $8 per million British thermal units, or double the
current levels, will come into effect from April 1, 2014.  NTPC dropped 1.7 percent to 145.60 rupees, after rising 3.1
percent yesterday. Tata Power Ltd. decreased 2.2 percent to
86.70 rupees, the most since June 20. Engineering firm  Larsen &
Toubro Ltd. (LT)  lost 1.5 percent to 1,429.5 rupees.  HDFC Bank (HDFCB)  decreased 1.8 percent to 656.55 rupees, the most
since June 20.  State Bank of India  lost 1.3 percent to 1,989.9
rupees.  Tata Motors (TTMT)  Ltd., owner of Jaguar and Land Rover, slid
1.2 percent to 286.45 rupees, the most in a week. Tractor maker
 Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM)  lost 0.8 percent to 978.9 rupees.  The rupee weakened 0.2 percent to 59.6650 per dollar at the
5 p.m. close, after earlier rising as much as 0.6 percent. The
currency sank to a record 60.765 on June 26.  The three-day advance pushed up Sensex’s valuation to 13
times projected 12-month earnings yesterday, the highest level
in three weeks and 33 percent more than MSCI  Emerging Markets 
Index’s multiple of 9.8, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange of India
fell 0.7 percent to 5,857.55. Its July futures settled at
5,863.05. India VIX, which measures the cost of protection
against losses in the Nifty, rose 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
