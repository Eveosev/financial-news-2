Gunvor Group, Trafigura Beheer BV and
Total SA failed to buy North Sea Forties, while OAO Lukoil was
unable to buy Russian Urals crude in the Mediterranean at the
highest differential to Dated Brent in 16 months.  Production at the Nexen Inc.-operated Buzzard field is back
at full rates, pumping approximately 204,000 barrels a day after
four days of reduced output, according to one person with
knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified because
the information is confidential.  North Sea  Total failed to buy Forties for loading July 16 to July 23
at 25 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, a Bloomberg survey
of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window
showed.  Trafigura and Gunvor placed bids for Forties for loading
July 24 to July 28 without attracting any sellers. Trafigura bid
a premium of 15 cents a barrel and Gunvor bid 25 cents a barrel,
5 cents less than its bid for the same loading dates yesterday.  Total was also unable to buy Ekofisk for loading July 17 to
July 24 at 95 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, while
 Statoil ASA (STL)  didn’t manage to sell an Ekofisk cargo loading July
23 to July 25 at a premium of $1.15 to Dated Brent.  There were no bids or offers for Brent and Oseberg crude.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days was 31 cents more than Dated Brent, compared with
a premium of 11 cents on July 1, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Brent for August settlement traded at $103.66 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $103.07 in the previous session. The September
contract was at $103.15 at the same time today, a discount of 51
cents to August.  Production at the North Sea Buzzard field has returned to
full capacity. The field had been running at reduced levels of
150,000-170,000 barrels a day since June 28 due to valves being
changed at some of the field’s wells, according to a person
familiar with the matter.  A Nexen media official, Karen Fordyce in Aberdeen,
 Scotland , wasn’t immediately available for comment by phone and
didn’t return a voice mail seeking comment.  The proportion of Buzzard crude in the Forties stream fell
to 42% in the week ending June 30, down 1% from a week earlier,
according to a statement on BP’s website.  Mediterranean/Urals  Lukoil failed to buy 80,000 metric tons of Urals for July
14 to July 18 loading at 55 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent
on a delivered basis to Augusta,  Italy , the survey showed. That
is the highest bid since Feb. 9, 2012.  Urals in the Mediterranean rose by 33 cents to a premium of
38 cents a barrel to Dated Brent, the most since Aug. 17, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed. In northwest Europe, the  grade 
rose by 18 cents to 43 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, the
highest since Aug. 15.  Gunvor failed to buy a 600,000 barrel cargo of Azeri Light
crude for loading July 28 to Aug. 1 at a premium of $3.25 a
barrel to Dated Brent, the survey showed.  Russia boosted crude and condensate production by 2.1
percent in June from a year earlier to a post-Soviet era record
of 10.53 million barrels a day, according to preliminary data
sent by e-mail today from the Energy Ministry’s CDU-TEK unit.  West Africa  Total offered 950,000 barrels of Angolan Cabinda crude for
loading on Aug. 2 to Aug. 3 at 20 cents a barrel more than Dated
Brent, 10 cents less than its last offer on June 28, the survey
showed.  Nigerian benchmark Qua Iboe rose 3 cents to $2.20 a barrel
more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  China International United Petroleum & Chemical Co., known
as Unipec, was said to have sold a cargo of Qua Iboe for loading
August 14 to August 15 to Bharat Petroleum, according to two
traders who participate in the market, who asked not to be
identified because the information is confidential. Qua Iboe
cargoes have been offered at premiums of about $2.70-$2.80/bbl
to Dated Brent this month.  Eight out of 56 cargoes of Angolan crude remain available,
according to three traders who participate in the market, who
asked not to be identified because the information is
confidential. The unsold cargoes are mainly Nemba and Cabinda
crude grades, the traders said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
