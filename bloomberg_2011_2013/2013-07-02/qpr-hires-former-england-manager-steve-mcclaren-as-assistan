Queens Park Rangers hired former
England soccer team manager  Steve McClaren  as an assistant
coach, the club said on its website.  McClaren, 52, quit in February as manager of FC Twente in
the Netherlands, ending his second stint with the club. He’s
also managed at Middlesbrough, Wolfsburg and Nottingham Forest.  “Everyone in the game knows what a top coach he is and
he’ll add something different to the group, regardless of how
long he is with us for,” QPR manager  Harry Redknapp  said.
“Steve adds to the excellent staff I already have here.”  QPR was relegated to the second-tier Championship last
season after finishing last in the Premier League.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
