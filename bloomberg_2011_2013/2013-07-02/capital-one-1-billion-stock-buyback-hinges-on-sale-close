Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) ’s board
authorized a plan to repurchase as much as $1 billion of the
company’s stock if it completes the sale of its portfolio of
 Best Buy Co. (BBY)  private label and co-branded credit cards to
Citigroup Inc.  If the sale closes, the  Federal Reserve  told Capital One it
may buy back the shares through March 31, the McLean, Virginia-based lender said today in a statement. The company expects the
sale to be completed in the third quarter, according to the
statement.  Capital One, led by Chief Executive Officer Richard
Fairbank, 62, agreed in February to sell the Best Buy credit-card business to New York-based Citigroup for an undisclosed
price. After this year’s annual stress test by the Fed, Capital
One said it would boost its dividend to 30 cents from 5 cents,
according to a statement at the time.  The timing and size of the share buyback will depend on
“closing of Capital One’s sale of the Best Buy portfolio,
market conditions, Capital One’s capital position, and internal
capital generation,” the company said today.  Capital One climbed 1.2 percent to $63.59 yesterday in New
York. The shares have advanced 9.8 percent this year, compared
with the 21 percent jump in the 24-company  KBW Bank Index. (BKX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
