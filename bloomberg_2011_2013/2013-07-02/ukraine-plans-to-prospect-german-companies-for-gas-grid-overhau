Ukraine plans to use German companies
such as  Siemens AG (SIE) , Deutsche Bank AG and Ferrostaal GmbH to
renovate its gas transportation network, Foreign Minister Leonid Kozhara said in Berlin today.  Ukraine’s government, seeking closer ties with the European
Union and improved security for gas delivery, intends to expand
a project forged with the three companies last year to modernize
a section of the Soyuz  gas pipeline , Kozhara said in a speech to
the German Council of Foreign Relations.  Ukraine is especially interested in developing underground
storage facilities, Kozhara said, referring to the Soyuz
project. “Our ambition is to extend this project to the whole
Ukrainian gas transportation system.”  Pricing disputes with OAO Gazprom,  Russia ’s natural-gas
export monopoly, have cut Ukrainian gas supplies to the EU at
least twice. Gazprom said last month that Europe deliveries in
the coming winter may be threatened by insufficient volumes in
Ukrainian storage.  Ukraine’s government-owned Naftogaz company forged a
project with German engineering company Ferrostaal GmbH and
finance from Deutsche Bank AG to modernize a gas compressor
station of the Soyuz pipeline last year, according to the Web
sites of  Naftogaz  and  UKrinform,  the national  news agency .  To contact the reporter on this story:
