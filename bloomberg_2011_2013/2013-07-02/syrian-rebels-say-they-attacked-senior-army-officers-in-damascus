A Syrian rebel group said it bombed a
government security office in the capital, Damascus, last night,
targeting a group of senior officers loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. There was no word on casualties.  Sham Brigade group released two videos claiming
responsibility for what one member said was the start of a
string of attacks against “commanders of Assad’s militias.” He
said the group would release the names of the targeted officers
later.  One video on YouTube showed plumes of smoke rising in the
dark from what the group said was the scene of the attack.
Gunshots could be heard, followed by the sound of sirens.  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist group
based in Coventry,  England , that reports casualties on both
sides of the conflict, said on its Facebook page that several
security personnel were injured in the attack.  Syria ’s state-run SANA news agency said a mortar fell near
the parking lot of the governor’s office, causing minor damage.  Rebels have targeted senior members of the Assad regime for
more than a year. One bomb last year killed members of Assad’s
top military establishment who were leading the fight against
the Syrian insurgency. They included Assad’s brother-in-law,
Assef Shawkat, Defense Minister Dawoud Rajhah and the vice
president’s military adviser, Hasan Turkmani. The men were the
most senior officials killed since the anti-Assad uprising
started in March 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
