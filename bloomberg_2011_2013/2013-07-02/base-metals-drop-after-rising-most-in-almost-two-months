Industrial metals declined as
concerns remained that economic growth in  China , the biggest
user, is slowing.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange declined as much as 0.9 percent to $6,919 a metric ton
and was at $6,937.75 by 10:28 a.m. in  Shanghai . Metal for
delivery in September on the Comex fell 0.4 percent to $3.146 a
pound.  China’s economic expansion in the second quarter may slow
to about 7.5 percent, the China Securities Journal reported
today, after two gauges of manufacturing released yesterday
showed growth slowing. Chinese bank valuations are close to
their lowest on record as the interbank funding crisis
exacerbates investors’ concern that earnings growth will stall
and defaults may surge.  “Concerns that China’s growth is slowing persist, leading
to some profit-taking after the gains yesterday,” Xu Liping, an
analyst at HNA Topwin Futures Co., said by phone from Shanghai.  Copper for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange climbed 1.2 percent to 50,000  yuan  ($8,159) a ton.  On the LME, aluminum, nickel, zinc, tin and lead fell.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
