Austria ’s top court upheld a 3 ½-year
jail sentence against Wolfgang Kulterer, the former head of Hypo
Alpe-Adria-Bank International AG, in a case over charges he
improperly loaned investors money for a 2004 share sale.  Verdicts against another board member, Guenter Striedinger,
a lawyer and a tax consultant in the case, were also upheld, the
court said on its website. The ruling means that Kulterer will
have to begin serving his sentence after he is contacted by
prison officials.  Austria, which nationalized Hypo Alpe in 2009 to avoid its
collapse under bad loans, has sought to prosecute former
managers it found responsible for the losses. A number of other
cases against Kulterer and other Hypo Alpe managers are still
pending in Austrian courts.  Kulterer’s lawyer Ferdinand Lanker didn’t immediately
return a call to his office seeking a comment. Kulterer pleaded
guilty in a separate case in 2008 to false accounting to hide
swaps losses at Hypo Alpe while he was chief executive officer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
