Gold declined for the first time in
three sessions as improving U.S. economic data strengthened the
case for the  Federal Reserve  to slow the pace of stimulus and as
a rising dollar cut the appeal of alternative investments.  Orders placed with U.S. factories rose in May, the Commerce
Department said today. Bullion futures slid 23 percent in the
second quarter, the most since at least 1975, as Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said that the central bank may slow its
bond-buying program this year. The dollar gained as much as 0.5
percent against a basket of six currencies, extending the year’s
advance to 4.6 percent.  “The market is nervous about what the Fed wants to do and
wants more clarity,” Phil Streible, a senior commodity broker
at R.J. O’Brien & Associates in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview. “Also, the stronger dollar continues to hurt gold.”  Gold futures for August delivery slid 1 percent to settle
at $1,243.40 an ounce at 1:42 p.m. on the Comex in  New York ,
after climbing as much as 0.9 percent. The metal gained 3.6
percent in the previous two sessions.  The metal has slipped 26 percent this year, wiping $59.8
billion from the value of gold-backed  exchange-traded product
holdings , as some investors lost faith in it as a store of
value. ETP assets fell 1.5 metric tons to 2,043.9 tons
yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Silver futures for September delivery fell 1.4 percent to
$19.309 an ounce on the Comex.  Trading was 48 percent lower than the average in the past
100 days for this time of day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery declined 1.1 percent to $1,367.80 an ounce.
Last month, the metal dropped 8.3 percent, the fifth straight
loss and the longest slump since October 2001.  Palladium futures for September delivery rose 0.3 percent
to $688.90 an ounce, the fourth straight advance and the longest
stretch of gains in more than a month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
