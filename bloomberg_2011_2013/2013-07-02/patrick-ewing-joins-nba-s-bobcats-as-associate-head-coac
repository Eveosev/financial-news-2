Patrick Ewing  was hired as associate
head coach of the Charlotte Bobcats, who are owned by former
National Basketball Association rival and Olympic teammate
 Michael Jordan .  Ewing, 50, joins the staff of coach Steve Clifford, who was
appointed by the Bobcats on May 29 after spending the past 13
years as an NBA assistant. Ewing worked with Clifford in Houston
(2003-08) and Orlando (2008-12).  The Bobcats yesterday also named Bob Beyer, Stephen Silas,
Bob Weiss and Mark Price as assistant coaches.  Ewing had interviewed for the Bobcats’ coaching vacancy in
2012 before it went to Mike Dunlap, who was fired in April after
going 21-61 in his first season. Charlotte’s 21 wins were the
second fewest in the NBA. Ewing also interviewed for the Detroit
Pistons’ coaching job in 2011.  Ewing and Jordan were rivals during their Hall of Fame
playing careers, meeting in the playoffs six times when Ewing
led the  New York  Knicks and Jordan was with the  Chicago Bulls .
They also played together on gold medal-winning teams for the
U.S. at the Olympics in 1984 and 1992.  To contact the reporter on this story:
