Canadian stocks rose a third day,
reaching the highest close in almost two weeks, as health-care
shares surged and energy producers rallied on higher crude
prices to offset losses among metal producers.  Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. (VRX)  added 4.8
percent after setting up a physician  loyalty program  in the U.S.
with Mentor Worldwide LLC. Penn West Petroleum Ltd. and
Athabasca Oil Corp. jumped more than 5 percent as crude rallied
to a 14-month high on concern that protests in  Egypt  will
threaten supplies. Barrick Gold Corp. and Silvercorp Metals Inc.
plunged at least 7.1 percent as prices for the metals retreated.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 49.27
points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,178.38 at 4 p.m. in Toronto, the
highest since June 19. The gauge has fallen 2.1 percent this
year. Trading volume was in line with the 30-day average.  “There’s concern in Egypt, oil is up,” said  Ian Nakamoto ,
director of research with MacDougall MacDougall & MacTier Inc.
in Toronto. The firm manages about C$4 billion ($3.8 billion).
“We’re waiting for Friday’s non-farm payroll reports. The best
thing for the equity market is if the  U.S. economy  continues to
improve, but at a slower pace than the Fed expects, which will
push out the end of QE.”  Markets in Toronto were closed yesterday for the Canada Day
holiday, while the S&P 500 rose 0.5 percent in the U.S.
Investors there continue to weigh data and statements from
Federal Reserve officials to determine whether the world’s
largest economy is strong enough for the central bank to scale
back stimulus measures. The  S&P 500  slipped 0.1 percent, ahead
of the monthly jobs report on July 5. The U.S. is Canada’s
largest trading partner.  Health-care Stocks  Seven of 10 industries in the S&P/TSX  advanced , extending
the index’s three-day rally to 1.9 percent. Health-care stocks

this year and closed today at its highest since 2000.  Valeant Pharmaceuticals jumped 4.8 percent to C$95, the
biggest jump since May 27. The company’s Medicis skin care
division is introducing a five-year loyalty program in the U.S.
that will include Mentor’s line of breast implant products. The
program gives physicians incentives for using Medicis and Mentor
products.  Telus Corp. (T)  rallied 3.1 percent to C$31.66 after analysts
with Canaccord Financial Inc. said investors had overestimated
how much Verizon Communications Inc. may shake up  Canada ’s
wireless market. Verizon said last month it was considering
entering the Canadian mobile-phone market, and the Globe and
Mail reported June 26 the company had submitted a bid for
Toronto-based Wind Mobile.  Telus, Rogers  Telus plunged 8 percent on the June 26 report, and Rogers

C$42.37 today.  Penn West Petroleum climbed 5 percent to C$11.65 and
Athabasca Oil rose 6.1 percent to C$6.91, driving the S&P/TSX
Energy Index to a 1.4 percent gain, the most in six weeks.  The price of crude rallied 1.6 percent to $99.60 a barrel,
the highest settlement since May 2012, on speculation U.S.
inventories may have dropped 2.25 million barrels last week to
the lowest level since May 31, according to a Bloomberg survey
before a report tomorrow. Oil extended gains as the political
showdown escalated in Egypt, which controls the  Suez Canal , a
key transit point for  oil tankers .  Materials Slump  Raw-materials producers led declines in the S&P/TSX,
falling 2.1 percent as a group. Gold slid for the first time in

percent June 28. Silvercorp Metals plunged 7.1 percent to
C$2.74.  Barrick Gold, the world’s largest producer, slumped 7.7
percent to C$15.32, the lowest level since 1992. Jefferies LLC
analyst Peter Ward downgraded the stock to hold from buy. The
gold miner on June 28 said it may write down as much as $5.5
billion on its Pascua-Lama project in the Andes after the price
of the metal plunged close to a three-year low.  Barrick is also likely to take other “significant”
impairment charges for the second quarter as it reviews goodwill
and other assets, the Toronto-based company said.  BlackBerry slumped 7.3 percent to C$10.22, its lowest close
since November. The BlackBerry 10 smartphone maker has plunged
35 percent in the past three days, after reporting a  surprise 
loss in its first quarter due to lackluster sales of the Z10
touchscreen phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
