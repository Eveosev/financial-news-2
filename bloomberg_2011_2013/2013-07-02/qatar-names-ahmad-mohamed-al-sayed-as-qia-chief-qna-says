Ahmad Al-Sayed, who headed Qatar
Holding LLC, was appointed chief executive officer of the Qatar
Investment Authority, the sovereign wealth fund of the world’s
richest nation, the country’s official  news agency  said today.  Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani will chair the wealth fund
and  Sheikh Abdullah  was named the vice chairman, the  Qatar News
Agency  reported, citing a royal decree. Finance Minister Ali Al Emadi was appointed a board member, it said.  The announcement came about about a week after Sheikh Hamad
Bin Khalifa Al Thani, who stripped his father of the title in a
1995 coup, handed power to his son. Sheikh Tamim, 33, assumed
leadership of a country of 1.9 million people that has developed
into a regional power during his father’s 18-year reign.  Al-Sayed replaces Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Al Thani. Hamad
Bin Jassim led Qatar’s government since 2007 as both premier and
foreign minister. He was replaced by Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa Al Thani as prime minister and Khalid bin Mohammad
Al Attiyah as foreign minister when Sheikh Tamim formed his
Cabinet, the official news agency said on June 26.  Hamad Bin Jassim was also chairman of Qatar Holding, the
foreign investment arm of the country’s sovereign wealth fund,
at a time when the fund bought stakes in  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  and  J
Sainsbury Plc. (SBRY)  The emirate’s money helped to support Barclays
Plc during the 2008 financial crises and bought  London ’s Harrods
department store in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
