The U.S. Energy Department said it is
 restructuring  a loan guarantee program designed to reduce  carbon
emissions  from coal, oil and natural gas after an effort focused
solely on coal failed to back any projects.  The reshaped plan, announced today by Energy Secretary
Ernest Moniz, is part of President  Barack Obama ’s strategy to
reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent from 2005
levels by 2020.  Power plants  are responsible for about 40 percent of U.S.
greenhouse gas emissions, with coal accounting for the bulk of
the CO2 released from electric utilities. Most scientists say
carbon emissions are contributing to the planet’s warming.  “These investments will play a critical role in
accelerating the introduction of low-carbon fossil fuel
technologies into the marketplace and reduce greenhouse gas
pollution,” Moniz said in a statement.  The Energy Department hasn’t touched its $8 billion in loan
guarantee authority that Congress provided in a 2005 energy law
for advanced fossil-energy projects. A 2008 solicitation for
companies’ bids focused solely on carbon capture projects at
coal plants.  The Energy Department may now back projects that capture
waste heat from industrial plants and limit methane emissions
during oil production, as well capture and store carbon from
coal-fired plants.  The solicitation will be completed probably sometime in
September after a public comment period ends, Moniz told
reporters today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
