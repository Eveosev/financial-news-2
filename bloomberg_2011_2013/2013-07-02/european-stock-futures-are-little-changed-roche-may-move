European stocks fell, following
yesterday’s rally for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, as a report
showed that U.K. construction expanded less than forecast.  Fresenius Medical Care AG plunged the most in more than a
decade as the U.S. Medicare program proposed cutting spending on
dialysis. Telefonica Deutschland Holding AG lost 1.7 percent as
Commerzbank AG lowered its recommendation for the mobile-phone
operator. Dialog Semiconductor Plc rose 7.6 percent after the
German maker of chips used in Apple Inc.’s iPhone agreed to buy
IWatt Inc. for as much as $345 million.  The Stoxx 600 slipped 0.4 percent to 287.13 at the close of
trading. The equity benchmark advanced yesterday as euro-area
factory output contracted in June less than estimated and
 Japanese manufacturers  turned optimistic for the first time
since the third quarter of 2011.  “Markets need a major catalyst to revive the uptrend,”
said Benedict Goette, chief executive officer of Compass Capital
AG in Zurich, which helps oversee about 700 million Swiss francs
($737 million). “We expect that the correction will continue.”  The Stoxx 600 advanced 1.7 percent last week as China
sought to ease a cash crunch. The gauge still lost 5.3 percent
in June after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the
central bank could reduce stimulus measures if the U.S. economy
improves in line with its forecasts.  U.K. Manufacturing  In the U.K., a report showed that construction rose less
than forecast in June. An  index of activity  in the industry
climbed to 51, from 50.8 in May. That missed the median
economist estimate in a Bloomberg survey for a reading of 51.2.  In the U.S., a Commerce Department release showed that
 orders placed  with U.S. factories climbed 2.1 percent in May,
following a revised 1.3 percent advance in April. The  median
forecast  of 61 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had called
for a 2 percent gain.  New York Fed President William C. Dudley speaks on regional
and national economic conditions at 12:30 p.m. in  Connecticut .
Fed Governor Jerome Powell will address a Deutsche Bundesbank
reception about reforming international financial regulations at
5:45 p.m. in New York.  Fresenius Medical Care slumped 8.7 percent to 49.71 euros
as the U.S. government’s Health and Human Services Department
 proposed  cutting payments to kidney-dialysis centers from next
year. Payments to the German company, which runs clinics
offering the procedure in the U.S., may drop 9.4 percent in 2014
under the plans to reduce spending on Medicare.  Telefonica Deutschland  Telefonica Deutschland declined 1.7 percent to 5.44 euros
after Commerzbank cut the German business of Telefonica SA to
hold from buy. The brokerage said that new uncertainties,
including a probable spectrum auction in Europe’s largest
economy in the next two years, limit the shares’ upside.  RWE AG and EON SE led a gauge of European utilities lower,
declining 4.1 percent to 22.30 euros and 2 percent to 12.18
euros, respectively. Morgan Stanley removed RWE from the list of
its best ideas. The brokerage reduced its earnings-per-share
estimates for 2014-15 by as much as 13 percent, saying that
 Germany ’s second-largest power producer faces a difficult market
in the near term.  Erste Group Bank AG lost 2 percent to 20.01 euros as
 Austria ’s biggest lender sold 661 million euros ($860 million)
of new shares to help repay state aid in a deal that reduces the
stakes of its key shareholders.  European Lenders  A gauge of European banks declined, contributing the most
to the Stoxx 600’s retreat. Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank,
Germany’s largest lenders, slid 4.6 percent to 6.16 euros and
1.5 percent to 31.92 euros, respectively.  Dialog Semiconductor surged 7.6 percent to 10.53 euros. The
German company said it will pay about $310 million in cash for
IWatt, which makes power-management technology for tablets and
smartphones. It may make an additional revenue-based payment of
as much as $35 million. Dialog also said it expects the
acquisition to add to earnings per share in the quarter after it
closes the deal.  Banco Sabadell SA rallied 14 percent to 1.53 euros, posting
the best performance on the Stoxx 600 and its largest rally
since September 2008.  Michelin & Cie. (ML)  increased 2 percent to 70.55 euros after

citing improved cost positions that enable more competitive
pricing and higher profits.  National benchmark indexes retreated in 13 of the 18
western-European markets today.  France ’s CAC 40 dropped 0.7
percent and Germany’s DAX slipped 0.9 percent. The U.K.’s FTSE
100 lost 0.1 percent.  Greece ’s ASE Index tumbled 3.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
