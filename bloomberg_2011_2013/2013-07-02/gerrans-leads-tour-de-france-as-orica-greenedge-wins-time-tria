Simon Gerrans took the Tour de
 France ’s race-leading yellow jersey for the first time as his
Orica-GreenEdge team won the time trial.  The Australian squad, in its second year at cycling’s elite
race, covered the 15.5-mile course through the streets of Nice
in 25 minutes, 56 seconds. Omega Pharma-Lotto was one second
back in second place and Team Sky third, two seconds further
back.  Gerrans took the lead from Jan Bakelants, a Belgian with
the RadioShack team. Race favorite Chris Froome is three seconds
further back in seventh place after building a  six-second
advantage  over Alberto Contador.  “It’s the pinnacle of this sport, to get the yellow
jersey,” Gerrans, 33, said in a televised interview. “So few
guys have had that honor.”  Gerrans had won yesterday’s hilly 90-mile stage in  Corsica ,
beating Peter Sagan in a photo finish.  Froome, a Kenya-born Briton who was second last year, is
the favorite to win the 100th edition of the race, according to
seven bookmakers’ odds on  oddschecker.com .  Two-time champion Contador of Team Saxo Bank is second
favorite with the seven bookmakers. The 2012 champion Bradley Wiggins is absent because of injury.  Tomorrow’s fifth stage is a 142-mile ride on rolling
terrain between Cagnes-sur-Mer and Marseille. The Tour, which
covers 2,116 miles, ends July 21 in Paris.  To contact the reporters on this story:
