Telus Corp. (T)  rose after Canaccord
Financial Inc. said investors had overestimated how much  Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ)  may shake up Canada’s wireless market.  Telus shares climbed 3.1 percent to C$31.66 at the close in
Toronto. Larger mobile-phone rival  Rogers Communications Inc. (RCI/B) 
advanced 2.8 percent to C$42.37.  The companies’ shares were oversold amid concern that
Verizon would usher in more intense competition, said
Canaccord’s Dvai Ghose and Sanford Lee. Verizon said last month
it was considering entering the Canadian mobile-phone market,
and the Globe and Mail reported June 26 the company had
submitted a bid for Toronto-based Wind Mobile. New York-based
Verizon may only be focused on the corporate and urban markets
of Canada, where it has more experience, the analysts said.  “These differences are important for investors, consumers
and the government, which may be naively assuming that Verizon
is the savior for wireless competition in Canada,” the analysts
said in a report today. They advise buying Telus and Rogers.  The analysts downgraded  BCE Inc. (BCE)  to hold from buy. Because
of its landline business, BCE has less exposure to the wireless
market than Vancouver-based Telus and Toronto-based Rogers. BCE
shares have fallen 2.8 percent since June 17, when the Globe and
Mail reported Verizon’s interest. Telus shares have dropped 9.4
percent and Rogers shares have declined 7.8 percent in that
span.  BCE fell less than 1 percent today to C$43.01.  To contact the reporter on this story:
