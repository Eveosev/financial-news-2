Serco Group Plc (SRP)  jumped to the highest
price in more than 12 years after the U.K. services company won
a  contract  worth as much as $1.25 billion for support tasks for
U.S. Medicare and Medicaid health plans.  The operator of prisons and  London ’s Docklands Light
Railway  rose  as much as 6.6 percent to 666 pence in London, the
highest price since October 2000. The stock was up 5.4 percent
at 659 pence as of 10:38 a.m., extending the Hook, England-based
company’s gain this year to 23 percent.  Serco was awarded a cost plus fixed-fee contract by the
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for a 12-month base
period starting on Oct, 1, with an option for four more 12-month
periods. The company’s duties will include intake and
troubleshooting of applications for programs including
children’s health insurance and the basic health program. A
Serco spokesman declined to comment.  The company may try to increase its U.S. work in areas such
as health care, air traffic control and business process
outsourcing to help offset government spending declines, Chief
Executive Officer Christopher Hyman said in August. The company
operates in more than 30 countries and has more than 120,000
employees, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
