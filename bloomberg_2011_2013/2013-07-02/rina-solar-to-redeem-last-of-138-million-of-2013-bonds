Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL)  said it expects to
retire the last of $138 million in bonds it issued in 2008 by
the deadline for repayment on July 15.  The Chinese solar panel maker said it has $57 million more
to repay on the principle of the bonds after it started making
repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2011, according to a
statement released today from the company’s headquarters in
Changzhou.  Trina’s competitors,  Suntech Power Holdings (STP)  Co. Ltd. and
LDK Solar Co. Ltd., both have failed to fully repay their debts
in the past year as manufacturing overcapacity depressed panel
prices worldwide.  Trina had $84 million of the notes outstanding at the end
of the first quarter and has purchased $27 million since then.
The company had $822.3 million in cash at the end of the first
quarter and bank borrowings of $1.2 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
