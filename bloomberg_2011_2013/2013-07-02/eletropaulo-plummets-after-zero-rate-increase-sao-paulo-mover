Eletropaulo Metropolitana de
Eletricidade de Sao Paulo SA,  a Brazilian power distributor,
slumped to a record low after getting an average electricity
rate increase equal to zero from the country’s regulator.  Eletropaulo dropped 7.2 percent to 5.78 reais at the close
in Sao Paulo, the lowest since the shares started trading in
September 2006.  Brazil ’s electricity regulator, known as Aneel, set revised
caps on how much Eletropaulo can charge different types of
consumers that will amount to a weighted-average increase of
zero in a vote today. The decision comes as President Dilma
Rousseff grapples with inflation that has helped trigger
nationwide street protests and follows an 18 percent cut on
household rates for some utility concessions renewed this year.  “This can’t be good news,” Luiz Roberto Monteiro, a
broker at Renascenca DTVM, said in a telephone interview from
Sao Paulo. “Everyone is concerned about who is going to be next
in not getting an increase.”  The government will give Sao Paulo-based Eletropaulo 506
million reais ($226 million) of aid in compensation for higher
costs with thermal electricity during a drought that undercut
hydro-power generation, Chief Executive Officer Britaldo Soares
told reporters in Brasilia after the Aneel vote. This will help
offset the zero increase, he said.  Aneel rules on rate changes based on criteria such as the
company’s performance, costs and efficiency.  To contact the reporters on this story:
