The European Commission said it won’t
let the furor over alleged U.S. snooping on European diplomatic
outposts get in the way of next week’s planned start of trans-Atlantic free-trade talks.  “While the beginning of EU-U.S. trade negotiation should
not be affected, the EU side will make it clear that for such a
comprehensive and ambitious negotiation to succeed, there needs
to be confidence, transparency and clarity among the negotiating
partners,” the commission said in a  statement  after it met
today in Strasbourg,  France .  French President Francois Hollande, already a skeptic of
the market-opening initiative, yesterday led calls for the
European Union to consider pushing back the negotiations
following the espionage charges by  Germany ’s Der Spiegel
magazine.  France was countered by the U.K., northern European
governments and the commission, which estimates that a jump in
trans-Atlantic commerce could pump an annual 119 billion euros
($155 billion) into the crisis-hit  European economy .  EU and U.S. officials are scheduled to start the talks on
July 8 in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
