New York’s Long Island Power
Authority and  National Grid Plc (NG/) , which operates the utility’s
electricity network, were sued by residents of Breezy Point, a
Queens neighborhood devastated by fire in Superstorm Sandy.  More than 100 homes were destroyed in Breezy Point, a
beachfront hamlet at the western tip of the Rockaways Peninsula,
after Sandy made landfall on Oct. 29, bringing 85 mile-per-hour
(137 kilometer-per-hour) winds and record-setting floods to New
York and New Jersey.  Residents sued LIPA and London-based National Grid in New
York State Supreme Court in Queens today. The residents accuse
the companies of failing to de-energize  power lines  in Breezy
Point that the residents say sparked the fires when they came
into contact with floodwaters.  LIPA and National Grid said in e-mailed statements that
their actions taken during Sandy were “reasonable and
appropriate” and that the companies believe the claims don’t
have merit.  The case is Heeran v. Long Island Power Authority,
705558/2013,  New York  State Supreme Court, Queens County.  To contact the reporter on this story:
