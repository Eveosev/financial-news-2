Gasoline gained as reports indicate a
stronger manufacturing outlook for the U.S. and the potential
for greater fuel demand. Crack spreads widened.  Futures rose as the Commerce Department reported  orders 
placed with U.S. factories jumped 2.1 percent in May. A report
yesterday showed the  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory
index rose to a three-month high of 50.9 from May’s 49, with a
reading above 50 indicating expansion. Prices have gained three
of the past four days as the U.S. approaches the July 4 holiday.  “Strong economic data is giving support,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago .
“Some of this may be short-covering and nervous buying going
into the holiday.”  August-delivery gasoline gained 4.22 cents, or 1.5 percent,
to $2.7801 a gallon at 10:35 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  on trading volume that was 0.4 percent above the 100-day average.  Gasoline’s  crack spread  versus WTI widened 76 cents to
$17.76 a barrel, the first gain in seven days. The fuel’s
 premium  over Brent gained $1.99 to $13.08.  Large speculators reduced net-long positions in gasoline
futures and options by 16,218 contracts to 23,544 contracts in
the week ended June 25, the lowest level since Oct. 1, 2010, the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission reported June 28.  “Over the past week, the market liquidated a significant
amount of its gasoline positions and it it’s reestablishing
longs in anticipation of increased demand for the July 4
holiday,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates
LLC in Houston.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 0.9 cent to $3.478 a
gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website.
Retail costs have retreated 20 consecutive days, dropping to the
lowest level since Jan. 31.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel, or ULSD, for August delivery rose
2.16 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.8952 a gallon on trading
volume that was 43 percent below the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate crude
fell 8 cents to $22.62 a barrel. The  premium over Brent  rose 18
cents to $17.87.  To contact the reporter on this story:
