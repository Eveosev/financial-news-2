Aldar Properties PJSC (ALDAR) ,  Abu Dhabi ’s
biggest developer, fell for the first time since acquiring
Sorouh Real Estate Co. on June 30 as investors speculated gains
were overdone.  The shares  fell  2.6 percent to 2.25 dirhams at the close in
Abu Dhabi today, trimming this year’s gain to 77 percent. Aldar
shares were the most-active in the  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  of
the  largest companies  in the Gulf, with more than 117 million
changing hands today. Aldar’s stock gained 11 percent in the
previous three days. Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  fell 0.7
percent to 3,583.74, trimming this year’s gain to 36 percent.  Aldar completed the acquisition of Sorouh on June 30,
creating a company with $13 billion in assets. The smaller
builder’s shares were delisted from Abu Dhabi’s bourse after
shareholders received 1.288 Aldar shares for each share held in
an all-stock transaction.  “If not fairly valued, the share is now very close,” Fadi Al Said, senior  fund manager  at ING Investment Management in
Dubai, said by phone. “Today’s drop is profit taking after
yesterday’s gains.” Aldar rose 6.45 percent yesterday.  HSBC Bank Middle East Ltd.’s analyst Patrick Gaffney on
June 23 set the price estimate for Aldar at 2.6 dirhams, the
highest among eight analysts in a Bloomberg  survey . Gaffney has
a neutral rating on the stock. Three analysts recommend
investors buy Aldar shares while three advise holding the stock,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Moody’s Investors Service yesterday raised Aldar’s rating
to B1 from B2 and said it was keeping the company on review for
an upgrade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
