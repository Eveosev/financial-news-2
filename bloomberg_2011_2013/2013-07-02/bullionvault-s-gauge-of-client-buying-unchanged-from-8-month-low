BullionVault , an online service for
investors to buy and sell physical gold and silver, said its
Gold Investor Index was unchanged in June from May’s eight-month
low, as prices slumped 11 percent.  The gauge held at 53, the London-based company said today
in an e-mailed report. It reached a 16-month high of 58.6 in
April. A reading above 50 means more buyers than sellers. The
company’s users still sold 3.7 percent of their holdings last
quarter. The metal fell 25 percent this year to $1,264.50 an
ounce by 8:32 a.m. in London.  Bullion slid 23 percent last quarter, the most since at
least 1920, as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
that the Fed may slow its bond-buying program this year. While
Standard Bank Plc’s SBG Securities (Pty) Ltd. unit said July 1
that physical demand has been “strong” at prices below $1,600,
Barclays Plc said the purchases have been weaker than when gold
entered a  bear market  in April, partly because  India , the top
buyer, imposed curbs on imports.  “The sharp drop in gold prices is starting to polarize
private investor attitudes,” Adrian Ash, head of research at
BullionVault, said in the report. “June’s torrid price action
led some long-term holders to take profits. But other people are
taking this opportunity to buy gold near three-year discounts.”  Gold trading volume increased 31 percent to 7.3 metric tons
in the second quarter from the first three months of the year.
The client buying gauge peaked at 71.7 in September 2011, the
month gold reached a record $1,921.15.  BullionVault’s customers own about $1.2 billion of gold,
the company said. The metal is stored in vaults in  London ,
Zurich,  New York  and  Singapore .  To contact the reporter for this story:
