Sabine Lisicki defeated Kaia Kanepi
of  Estonia  to reach the semifinals of the Wimbledon tennis
tournament as rain disrupted other matches.  Lisicki, 23, won 6-3, 6-3. The German, who knocked out top
seed Serena Williams in the last round, will play the winner of
the match between China’s Li Na and Agnieszka Radwanska of
 Poland . Lisicki also reached the semifinals at the All England
Club in 2011.  “It’s so nice,” Lisicki said in a televised interview.
“I did it two years ago, and today I felt even better. There’s
no pressure because it’s a game I love, and I still do. I just
want to go out and enjoy myself.”  Radwanska is leading 4-1 in the third set after losing the
second set to Li to even the quarterfinal, which was halted
because of the downpour. Wimbledon closed the roof over Centre
Court to allow the match to continue.  In the other half of the draw,  France ’s Marion Bartoli
leads Sloane Stephens of the U.S. 5-4 in the first set on Court
1, which is under rain covers. The quarterfinal between 2011
champion Petra Kvitova of the Czech Republic and Kirsten
Flipkens of  Belgium  won’t start until the end of the Li-Radwanska match.  To contact the reporter on this story:
