Sugar production in  Pakistan ,  Asia ’s
fourth-largest producer, may jump as much as 20 percent to a
record next year as higher state-set cane prices spur farmers to
boost planting, potentially increasing exports.  Output may expand to 6 million metric tons in the marketing
year starting Nov. 1 from 5 million tons this year, said Shunaid Qureshi, chairman of the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association. That
may boost surplus for exports, he said.  Futures tumbled to the lowest since July 2010 in  New York 
on June 4 on signs the harvest is accelerating in  Brazil , the
world’s largest grower. Production globally will be 10 million
tons more than than consumption in 2012-2013, boosting a glut,
according to the London-based International Sugar Organization.  “The growers are getting good prices for their sugar
cane,” Qureshi said in an interview. “There is a chance that
the government might increase cane prices in the coming crushing
season” from an all-time high 172 rupees ($1.73) per 40
kilograms in the 2012-2013 season, he said.  The area under cane may increase about 10 percent from 1.7
million hectares (4.2 million acres) in 2012-2013 and yields may
climb because of good monsoon rainfall, he said.  A bigger harvest may leave about 1 million tons for exports
after setting aside 4.5 million tons for domestic consumption
and 500,000 tons as government reserves, Qureshi said.  The country  exports  mainly to the  Middle East , the Far East
and  Africa , he said. Shipments totaled 900,000 tons since May
2012 and mills are planning to ship a further 300,000 tons
before the next harvest, he said on June 27.  Raw sugar for October delivery fell 1.4 percent to settle
at 16.69 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York
yesterday, capping the longest decline since June 4. Futures are
down 14 percent this year, set for a third straight annual
decline, the longest losing streak since 1992.  To contact the reporter on this story:
