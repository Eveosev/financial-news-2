Ethanol weakened against gasoline on
concern that record-high seasonal stockpiles of the motor fuel
will diminish consumption of the additive.  The spread, or price difference, widened 5.74 cents to
47.23 cents a gallon after  gasoline stockpiles  in the week ended
June 21 jumped to the highest level since March 1, U.S. Energy
Information Administration data show. Ethanol, with inventories
at the lowest for the time of year in data going back to 2010,
is blended with the motor fuel to stretch supply and meet
federal mandates.  “We’re low on ethanol stocks, but we’re high in gasoline
stocks,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at Intl FCStone in
 Des Moines ,  Iowa .  Denatured ethanol for August delivery fell 1.2 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $2.311 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The July contract, which expires tomorrow, was unchanged at
$2.41. Prices have gained 10 percent this year.  Gasoline for August delivery gained 4.54 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $2.7833 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol is produced from corn in the U.S., with one bushel
of the grain making at least 2.75 gallons of the renewable fuel.  Corn Supply  Farmers planted 97.4 million acres of corn, the most since
1936, the Agriculture Department said June 28, as they seek to
rebound from last summer’s U.S. drought that ravaged crops and
forced ethanol plants to temper operations in the face of higher
costs.  The prospect of more corn and lower ethanol production
costs is lowering prices, said Justin Dirico, manager of the
biofuels desk at Eagle Energy Brokers LLC in  New York .  “Corn continues its weakness in new crop and is putting
substantial pressure on ethanol prices down the curve,” he
said.  Corn for July delivery climbed 17.25 cents, or 2.6 percent,
to $6.7275 a bushel in Chicago. The more actively traded
December contract advanced 1.5 cents to $5.0275 a bushel.  The corn crush spread, or the cost difference between a
gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, was minus 5
cents, down from 3 cents yesterday and compared with minus 35
cents on Dec. 31, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  RINs Prices  Compliance with a law that requires refiners to use 13.8
billion gallons of ethanol in gasoline is tracked by Renewable
Identification Numbers, or RINs. Companies can submit the
credits to the government or trade them.  Corn-based ethanol RINs  fell 3 cents to $1, while  advanced
RINs , which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based
ethanol, declined 1 cent to $1.08, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  In cash market trading, ethanol decreased 4 cents to $2.47
a gallon in New York, 3 cents to $2.40 in  Chicago , 4 cents to
$2.47 on the  Gulf Coast  and 3 cents to $2.62 a gallon on the
West Coast, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  New York Harbor’s premium over Chicago shrank by 1 cent to
7 cents, while the Gulf Coast’s discount to New York Harbor
expanded 1 cent to 15 cents, the widest since June 24.  Ethanol  production  gained 15 percent to 885,000 barrels a
day in the week ended June 21 from an all-time low in January,
data from the EIA, the Energy Department’s research arm, show.  Inventories that week fell 1 percent to 16.3 million
barrels, 22 percent below a year earlier.  Ethanol  imports  fell 42 percent to 38,000 barrels a day
from the previous week, the EIA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
