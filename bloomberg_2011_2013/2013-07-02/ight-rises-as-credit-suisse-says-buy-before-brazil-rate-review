Light SA (LIGT3) ,  Brazil ’s second-cheapest
electric utility on a price-to-earnings basis, rose the most on
the Ibovespa as Credit Suisse Group AG recommended buying the
stock before a rate adjustment scheduled for November.  The  shares  added 2.9 percent to 15.86 reais at 1:02 p.m. in
Sao Paulo. The benchmark stock gauge  declined  2.5 percent. The
stock trades at 6.2 times its estimated earnings, about one-third the average for Brazilian electricity companies, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Credit Suisse raised its recommendation on Light from the
equivalent of hold, saying it is well positioned to make a case
for financial losses and capital spending to be considered by
regulators when they determine rate increases, according to a
research note dated today.  “It now offers a combination of attractive valuation and
more balanced risks,” Credit Suisse analysts Vinicius Canheu
and Pedro Manfredini wrote in the note. “As newsflow on the
tariff review should start in mid-July, we believe it is now a
good time to start adding positions to the stock.”  The power company’s press office didn’t immediately respond
to an e-mail and phone call seeking comment.  Light has dropped 29 percent this year, the third-worst
performance on the Bovespa Electric Energy Index of 16 power
companies, which fell 14 percent. Its price-to-earnings ratio
among Brazilian utilities is higher only than that of Cia.
Energetica de Sao Paulo, which is up 1.6 percent in 2013 and
trades at a multiple of 5.3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
