NRG Energy Inc. (NRG) , the largest
independent U.S. electricity generator, agreed to install a 6.2-megawatt solar system at  MGM Resorts International (MGM) ’s Mandalay
Bay resort convention center in Las Vegas.  The 20,000-panel solar array will produce enough power for
1,000 homes and at peak production will meet about 20 percent of
Mandalay Bay’s demand, Las Vegas-based MGM said in a statement
today. The casino operator will buy the electricity from NRG
under a long-term contract. Terms weren’t released.  To contact the reporter on this story:
