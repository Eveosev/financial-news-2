Yakutsk, the largest city where the
soil is perennially frozen, won a 2.1 billion-ruble ($64
million) loan from the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development for a new reservoir and water-treatment plant.  The eastern Siberian city will receive funding for the
biggest water project the  development bank  has financed in
 Russia  to help raise drinking water to European Union and
Russian standards as supplies have reached a critical level, the
bank said in a statement.  The 13-year loan to the city of 270,000 people is important
as Yakutsk tries to adapt to changes in the course of the Lena
River, the sole source of city water, as well as reduced depth
that’s affecting the region, the bank said.  Severe climate significantly increases the cost of
operating Yakutsk’s water supply and treating wastewater. During
Siberia’s long winter, its drinking water has to be heated
before being pumped through the distribution system to stop
pipes from freezing. Hot water also has to be injected into
sewer pipes to make wastewater treatment possible in Arctic
temperatures, the EBRD said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
