Veolia Environnement, Europe’s
biggest water company, won a contract to build a desalination
plant in Saudi Arabia that will supply a petrochemicals factory.  The design and construction will generate $310 million in
revenue, and operations will deliver $92 million over 10 years,
the Paris-based company said today in a statement. The order,
awarded by Saudi utility Marafiq, may be extended by 20 years.  Saudi Arabia, with the Arab world’s largest economy and a
growing population, is expanding water projects to supply
households and industrial plants. The kingdom is the world’s
biggest producer of desalinated water, attracting foreign
investors including Veolia competitor Suez Environnement.  The new plant, which will use ultrafiltration and reverse-osmosis technologies, will have a capacity of 178,000 cubic
meters a day and start production in June 2015. It will supply
the Sadara petrochemical complex built by Dow Chemical Co. and
Saudi Arabian Oil Co. in Jubail.  The contract reflects Veolia’s increased focus on fast-growing markets such as the Middle East and industrial clients.
Chief Executive Officer Antoine Frerot is seeking to counter
narrowing profit margins back home amid greater competition for
municipal contracts to supply drinking water and waste handling.  The company said last month it’s building a seawater
desalination plant in Lamberts Bay on the southwest coast of
South Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
