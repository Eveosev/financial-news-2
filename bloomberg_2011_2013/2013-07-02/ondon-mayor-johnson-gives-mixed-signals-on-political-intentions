Boris Johnson  gave mixed messages
about his political intentions, hinting he may fight for a third
term as mayor of London after 2016 and then saying he will
definitely stand down.  Johnson has repeatedly refused to rule himself
out as a future leader of the  Conservative Party , although he
would have to return to Parliament as a lawmaker in order to
stand. Prime Minister  David Cameron  is currently trailing in
opinion polls and there is speculation he may face a leadership
challenge if the Tories lose the 2015 general election.  Asked about his leadership ambitions on a radio
phone-in show today, Johnson said standing for a third term is
“something I think about and something I talk to friends
about” because there will be unfinished business he wants to
complete.  “You mean, if it was a sort of a ’reverse Mursi’
situation?” Johnson joked on LBC radio, referring to Egyptian
President Mohamed Mursi. “If there were hundreds of thousands
of people actively calling for an extension of the
administration” he would stay on for a further four-year term,
he said.  Moments later, Johnson added, “the truth is, I’m stepping
down in 2016. After that, who knows what will happen.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
