German stocks  dropped, erasing
yesterday’s rebound, led by a selloff in Fresenius Medical Care
AG, as investors awaited a report that may show U.S. factory
orders increased in May.  Fresenius Medical, the world’s biggest provider of kidney
dialysis, tumbled 9 percent after the U.S. government proposed
cutting payments for center operators next year, while major
shareholder Fresenius SE slid 4.4 percent.  RWE AG (RWE)  extended a 21-month low after Morgan Stanley downgraded Germany’s second-largest utility.  The  DAX (DAX)  fell 0.9 percent to 7,914.82 at 10:26 a.m. in
 Frankfurt . The index rose 0.3 percent yesterday as  equities 
around the world rallied after manufacturing data from  Japan  to
the U.S. bolstered confidence in the global economy. The gauge
has lost 7.3 percent since the Federal Reserve signaled on May
22 that it may start to pare stimulus if the U.S. economy
strengthens. The broader HDAX Index also slid 0.9 percent today.  “This will be a short term correction,” Ramin Nakisa,
global asset allocation strategist at UBS AG, told Francine Lacqua on Bloomberg Television in  London . “We view this period
as buying opportunity, a chance to load up on risk.”  A U.S. Commerce Department report at 10 a.m. in  Washington 
today may show orders placed with factories rose 2 percent in
May, according to the median economist forecast in a Bloomberg
survey. They rose 1 percent the previous month.  Fresenius Medical  Fresenius Medical dropped 9 percent to 49.54 euros after
the U.S. government proposed cutting payments to kidney-dialysis
center operators by 9.4 percent next year.  “This is a very dramatic cut,” Robert Sepucha, Fresenius’
senior vice president for government affairs in the U.S., said
by telephone. “We’re concerned it would push dialysis clinics
under the cost of care, which is not the right thing for
Medicare to be doing.”  Fresenius SE, which owns a 31 percent stake in the kidney
dialysis operator, lost 4.4 percent to 91.25 euros. Chief
Executive Officer Ulf Mark Schneider told Euro am Sonntag in May
that Fresenius Medical will account for 20 percent to 30 percent
of the company’s profit in the future.  RWE Downgraded  RWE dropped 2.9 percent to 22.57 euros after Morgan Stanley
lowered its recommendation for the utility to equal weight from
overweight. The bank also removed the company from its “best
ideas” list and cut its 2014 to 2015 earnings estimate by 12 to
13 percent.  RWE slipped to a 21-month low yesterday after saying its
outlook for 2013 was unchanged even as a court ruled in its
favor in a dispute over gas payments to Gazprom.  EON AG,  Germany ’s largest utility, fell 3.3 percent to
12.02 euros. A gauge of utility stocks declined the most of the
19 industry groups on the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Talanx AG slid 4.3 percent to 23.44 euros after major
shareholder HDI Haftpflichtverband der Deutschen Industrie VaG
announced plans to sell a 3.2 percent stake in the insurer. The
shares are being offered at 23.20 euros to 23.80 euros apiece
via an accelerated bookbuild, according to the terms obtained by
