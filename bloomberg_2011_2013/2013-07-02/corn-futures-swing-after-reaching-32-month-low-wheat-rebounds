Wheat rose in Chicago, snapping the
longest string of declines in eight years, as  Egypt  bought
180,000 tons of the grain. Corn gained, while soybeans fell.  Egypt, the world’s biggest importer, bought 180,000 tons of
Ukrainian and Romanian wheat today in its first tender since
February, the state-run buyer said. The nation’s cabinet said
June 26 that national stockpiles would meet demand until Nov.
17. The country has struggled to pay for food and fuel as
foreign-currency reserves dwindled amid political upheaval and
social unrest.  “This tender supports the theory that Egypt doesn’t have
as much wheat as they said they did,” Mike Zuzolo, the
president of Global Commodity Analytics & Consulting in
Lafayette,  Indiana , said in a telephone interview. “This breaks
the idea that they’re insulated with five or six months of
supplies. It’s more like they have 45 to 60 days of supplies.”  Wheat futures for September delivery rose 0.5 percent to
settle at $6.5825 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade. Prices slid 8.3 percent in eight sessions before today,
capping the worst run since June 2005, as global production is
forecast to reach a record by the Agricultural Market
Information System.  Egypt bought 3.53 million tons of domestic wheat by June
15, up from 3.2 million tons at the same time in 2012, amid
expectations that the country would harvest a record 9.5 million
tons. The nation’s military issued a 48-hour ultimatum to
President Mohamed Mursi yesterday to find a solution to the
country’s political impasse.  Corn futures for December delivery gained 0.3 percent to
$5.0275 a bushel in Chicago, the first increase in nine
sessions. Earlier, prices fell to $4.965, the lowest since
October 2010.  Soybean futures for November delivery fell 0.1 percent to
$12.425 a bushel on the CBOT. The price reached $12.35, the
lowest for a most-active contract since February 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
