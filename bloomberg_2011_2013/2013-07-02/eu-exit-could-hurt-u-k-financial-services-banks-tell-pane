A U.K. exit from the European Union
could hurt the country’s financial-services industry, banks told
a parliamentary inquiry.  “Our ability to provide services to clients and engage in
investment activities throughout  Europe  is dependent on the
passport that London-based firms enjoy to operate on a cross-border basis within the union,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
JPMorgan Chase & Co. wrote in evidence to the Parliamentary
Commission on Banking Standards, which published its final
report on June 19.  “If the U.K. leaves, it is likely that the passport will
no longer be available, thereby forcing firms that wish to
access EU markets to move their operations to within those
markets,” the banks wrote.  The comments were reported in a House of Commons paper on
the impact of an EU exit. Prime Minister  David Cameron  said in
January he wants a referendum on membership by the end of 2017,
following a renegotiation of Britain’s relationship with the
bloc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
