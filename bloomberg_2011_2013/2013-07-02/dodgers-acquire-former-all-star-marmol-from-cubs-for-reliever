The  Los Angeles Dodgers  acquired
relief pitcher Carlos Marmol from the  Chicago Cubs , a week after
the former All-Star was designated for assignment.  The Dodgers received the 30-year-old Marmol for relief
pitcher Matt Guerrier, who was also designated for assignment
last week, the Major League Baseball team said today on its
Twitter account.  Los Angeles  also received an undisclosed amount
of cash and an international signing bonus slot valued at
$209,700.  Marmol opened the season as the Cubs closer and lost the
role after giving up five earned runs and recording five outs
over his first three appearances of year. He is 2-4 with a 5.86
earned run average with 21 walks and 32 strikeouts in 27 2/3
innings.  An All-Star in 2008, Marmol had at least 20 saves in each
of the three seasons before 2013. Since 2007, he leads all MLB
relief pitchers with 644 strikeouts and ranks fourth with a .174
batting average against, according to the Dodgers.  Los Angeles, which opened the season as the National League
favorite to win the  World Series , is 38-43, in last place in the
NL West. Guerrier, 34, was 2-3 with a 4.80 ERA.  The Dodgers will pay about $500,000 of the remaining $5
million on Marmolâ€™s contract, according to MLB.com. Guerrier has
about $1.8 million left on a three-year, $12 million agreement.  -- Editors: Michael Sillup, Jay Beberman  To contact the reporters on this story:
