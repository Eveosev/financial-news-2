Deutsche Annington Immobilien SE (ANN) ,
 Germany ’s largest residential landlord, has received demand for
more than 80 percent of the shares being offered in a 1.1
billion-euro ($1.4 billion) initial public offering, according
to a message sent to investors.  Books for the sale will close at 3 p.m. in  London  and more
investors have indicated they will buy shares, according to the
message obtained by Bloomberg News. Shares expected to be sold
within their price range of 18 to 21 euros apiece, according to
the message.  Deutsche Annington, the second German real estate company
to list this year, is attempting to attract investors as market
indexes are losing their gains. China money-market rates have
reached a record, a sign of a cash squeeze, and the Federal 
Reserve recently said it may pare bond buying should the U.S. 
economy improve. The Stoxx 600 index had its first monthly loss 
in over a year in June.  HD Supply Holdings Inc. and CDW Corp., two U.S. companies
backed by private-equity firms, had to price their IPOs below
their original targets last month. Votorantim Cimentos SA,
 Brazil ’s biggest cement producer, rescheduled a planned $3.7
billion IPO for September.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley are leading
Deutsche Annington’s IPO. Other managers include Bank of America
Corp., Deutsche Bank AG, Societe Generale SA, Berenberg Bank,
Commerzbank AG and Kempen & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
