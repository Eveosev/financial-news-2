Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) , which derived
11 percent of sales from the Pacific region last year, said a
weak yen has curbed unit revenue for the fourth month in a row.  Revenue for each seat flown a mile rose 1 percent in June,
as gains in the trans-Atlantic and Latin American regions were
partially offset by the yen’s devaluation, according to a
statement today.  The Japanese currency, weakened by unprecedented monetary
easing, has pressured Delta’s unit revenue every month since
March, according to the last four monthly statements from the
Atlanta-based company. The yen has slumped about 14 percent
against the  U.S. dollar  in 2013 as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
pledged to reverse more than 10 years of deflation. Abenomics,
as the current policies are known, have been cutting into sales
of multinational companies exporting to the region.  Delta fell 1.9 percent to $18.99 at the close in  New York .
The shares have rallied 60 percent this year, surpassing a 38
percent gain in the Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
