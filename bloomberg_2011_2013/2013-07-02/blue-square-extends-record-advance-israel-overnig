Alon  Blue Square (BSI)   Israel  Ltd. rallied,
extending the supermarket operator’s record annual advance in
 New York , to trade at a premium over its Tel Aviv shares.  Blue Square jumped almost 6 percent to $3.47 in New York
yesterday, extending a 12-month rally to 54 percent and leaving
the stock 1.2 percent above the shares in Israel. The Bloomberg
Israel-US Equity Index fell for the first time in three days as
SodaStream International Ltd. dropped to a one-week low.  Elbit
Systems Ltd. (ESLT) , an Israeli defense developer, closed at a 0.5
percent discount to its Tel Aviv-traded shares.  Israeli grocers that tumbled in June, including  Shufersal
Ltd. (SAE) , the nation’s largest supermarket chain,  Rami Levi Chain
Stores Hashikma Marketing 2006 Ltd. (RMLI)  and Blue Square,
outperformed the  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  in  Tel Aviv  yesterday. Blue Square,
which owns the Mega, Shefa Shuk and Eden Nature chains, is
trading at 0.7 times book value, or assets minus liabilities,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s about half the
valuation of the last five years.  “There has been a bit of a rally in the sector recently,”
Zach Herzog, head of international sales at Psagot Investment
House Ltd. in Tel Aviv, said by phone yesterday. “People think
that maybe the sector is getting some strength and the shares
are undervalued.”  The Bloomberg Israel-US gauge slipped 0.7 percent to 90.88
yesterday, compared with a 0.3 percent advance for the benchmark
TA-25, which capped its third day of gains.  Blue Square, based in Rosh Ha’Ayin, Israel, jumped the most
in three months in New York. Its Tel Aviv-listed shares gained
3.6 percent to 12.48 shekels, or $3.43.  SodaStream (SODA) , a home soda-machine maker, had the largest
decline in the index of the biggest Israeli companies in New
York. The Airport City, Israel-based company fell 4.2 percent to
$67.41.  Elbit, based in Haifa, Israel, rose 1.2 percent to $42.97
in New York. The Tel Aviv-listed shares gained 1.6 percent to
157.30 shekels, or $43.19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
