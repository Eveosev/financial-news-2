Persimmon Plc (PSN) , the U.K.’s largest
homebuilder by market value, said first-half revenue climbed 12
percent as the government’s Help to Buy loan program lifted
demand.  Revenue rose to about 900 million pounds ($1.4 billion)
from 806.7 million pounds a year earlier, the York, England-based company said today in a statement. The operating margin
widened to about 15 percent from 12.1 percent as prices rose,
Persimmon said.  “There’s certainly more confidence in the market, which is
being supported by more mortgage lending,” Chief Executive
Officer Jeff Fairburn said in a telephone interview.  The Help to Buy program, introduced in March, offers loans
of 20 percent of the value of a property worth as much as
600,000 pounds to buyers of new homes. The number of homes being
reserved by Persimmon’s customers each week rose 30 percent
since the program started compared with a year earlier, the
company said. Most of these reservations resulted in sales.  Persimmon was down 1.3 percent at 1,224 pence at the 4:30
p.m. close of trading in  London . The shares have gained 64
percent this year, the best performance in the Bloomberg EMEA
Home Builders Index, which has risen 31 percent.  Price Increase  Persimmon’s average home selling price increased 5 percent
to about 179,200 pounds in the first half, according to the
statement. The company completed 5,022 homes during that time, 7
percent more than last year.  The government is underwriting mortgages and providing
cheap funding to banks in an attempt to boost the economy
through construction. Total gross mortgage lending in the U.K.
rose about 20 percent in May from the previous month to 14.7
billion pounds, the most since October 2008, the  Council of
Mortgage Lenders  said on June 20.  Persimmon said 1,124 of its customers reserved homes using
Help to Buy.  The initiative “has generated interest in the market and
it’s bought potential purchasers to site,” Fairburn said. “It
has demonstrated to people that there is affordability out there
and they do have the opportunity to buy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
