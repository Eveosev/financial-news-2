India ’s rupee fell, reversing earlier
gains, on speculation importers stepped up purchases of the
dollar.  The currency rose as much as 0.6 percent today on optimism
foreign funds would buy more Indian stocks. Provisional data
from BSE Ltd. show overseas investors bought a net 11.2 billion
rupees ($188 million) of equities on June 28, ending 13 straight
days of outflows, after the government agreed to raise natural-gas prices to encourage exploration. This is part of a policy
overhaul to revive an economy that grew at a decade-low rate of
5 percent in the year ended March 31.  “The drop in the rupee was largely due to importers’”
purchases of dollars, said Ashtosh Raina, head of foreign-exchange trading at  HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB)  in Mumbai. “We saw some
corporate inflows earlier.”  The rupee weakened 0.2 percent to 59.6650 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. One-month
implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the exchange
rate used to price options, rose 15 basis points, or 0.15
percentage point, to 12.25 percent.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards fell 0.5 percent to
60.62 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Offshore non-deliverable contracts fell 0.4 percent to 60.72.
Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and
date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
