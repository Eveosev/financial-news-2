The Canadian dollar fell to a 20-month low as U.S. manufacturing picked up in May, adding to
evidence a strengthening U.S. economy is outpacing its neighbor.  The currency weakened after a report June 28 showed
Canada’s economy slowed in April, with 0.1 percent growth
domestic product growth from 0.2 percent the previous month.
U.S. 10-year yields traded at almost a two-year high as factory
orders grew 2.1 percent in May, compared with a revised 1.3
percent in April. The U.S. is forecast to have added jobs last
month while Canada’s payrolls declined, according to separate
surveys by Bloomberg before reports July 5.  “We’re still biased to see yields move higher and a
stronger U.S. dollar, so Canada will get caught in that
crossfire,” said  David Tulk , chief macro strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank’s TD securities unit in Toronto.  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known, fell 0.5
percent to C$1.0544 per U.S. dollar at 5 p.m. in Toronto,
reaching the weakest level since Oct. 4, 2011. One loonie buys
94.84 U.S. cents.  The currency’s 14-day relative strength index against the
dollar was at 67.7, almost the 70 level that some traders see as
a signal an asset has moved too far, too fast and may be due to
reverse course.  Bonds Gain  Canada’s benchmark 10-year government bond rose, with
yields falling four basis points, or 0.04 percentage points, to
2.40 percent. The 1.5 percent security maturing in June 2023
added 30 cents to C$92.08. U.S. 10-year yields fell one basis
point to 2.47 percent in New York.  Canadian corporate bond issuance reached a record high in
the first half of this year, fueled by debt sales of the
country’s biggest financial firms.  BCE Inc. (BCE) , Canada’s largest telecommunications provider, and
toll-road operator 407 International Inc. were among firms that
sold C$55 billion ($52 billion) in bonds this year, 25 percent
higher than the first six months of 2012 and the most since at
least 1999, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. BCE was the
biggest issuer of debt excluding the banks, which accounted for
half of corporate bond issuance in the period.  U.S. nonfarm payrolls increased 165,000 in June, while the
unemployment rate declined to 7.5 percent from 7.6 percent the
previous month, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.
Canada sends nearly 70 percent of its exports to the U.S.  Jobs Reports  Canada ’s payrolls dropped 5,000 drop in June, according to
a Bloomberg survey. That would compare with a 95,000 increase in
May, the nation’s largest one-month employment increase in more
more than a decade.  “The data seems to be favoring the U.S. lately and that’s
seen Canada fall behind a little bit,” said Don Mikolich,
executive director of foreign exchange sales at Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce, by phone from Toronto.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities rose 0.8
percent, while crude oil advanced 1.7 percent to $99.63 a barrel
in New York, touching the highest level since September 2012.  U.S. President  Barack Obama  said last week his
administration would approve  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Keystone XL
pipeline if it “does not significantly exacerbate the problem
of carbon pollution.” The administration has said a decision on
Keystone will come in months.  “When the Keystone was in play, the loonie was at multi-year highs,” said  Dean Popplewell , head analyst in Toronto at
the online currency-trading firm Oanda Corp. “It is still
considered a commodity currency.”  The loonie is down 0.2 percent this year against nine
developed-nation currencies tracked by the Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Index. The greenback gained 6.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
