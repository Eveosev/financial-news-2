Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  sold $28.5 million
of notes tied to  Lennar Corp. (LEN) , the largest such offering in at
least three and a half years.  The one-year securities, issued June 27, yield 8 percent a
year plus 65 percent of any gains if Lennar rises more than 16.8
percent, according to a prospectus filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. If the stock fails to climb at least 11.5
percent, investors can lose as much as 28.25 percent of their
principal.  Lennar, the third-biggest U.S. homebuilder by revenue, fell
9.5 percent this year to $34.99 as of the close of trading
today.  Increasing mortgage rates could affect home sales, said
 David Williams , equity research analyst at Williams Financial
Group Inc. in Dallas. The average cost of new 30-year, fixed-rate home loans has  climbed  to 4.34 percent from a record low
3.36 percent in December, according to Bankrate.com data.  “The concern for us isn’t the rising rates and what that
does to monthly payments,” he said in a telephone interview.
“It’s more about the appreciation combined with the interest
rates that make the qualifying income out of reach for some
buyers.”  Elise Wilkinson, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo, declined to
comment on the securities.  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in  interest rates  or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
