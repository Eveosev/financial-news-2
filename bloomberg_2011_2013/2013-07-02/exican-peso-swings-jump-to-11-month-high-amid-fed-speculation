Mexico  peso volatility rose to an 11-month high, extending a five-week surge, as investors weigh an
improving export outlook against speculation that the Federal
Reserve will scale back U.S. stimulus measures.  Three-month historical volatility, a measure of the
magnitude of the peso’s fluctuations during the period, rose to
12.78 percent at 9:21 a.m. in Mexico City, the highest since
August, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The peso was
little changed at 12.9582 per dollar.  While data showing improvements in U.S. manufacturing and
the labor market are fueling speculation the Fed will taper a
bond buying program that’s boosted demand for higher-yielding
Mexican debt, the reports are also bolstering confidence in
Latin America’s second-biggest economy. Mexico sends about 80
percent of exports to its northern neighbor.  “This optimism, the underlying variables for Mexico
haven’t changed,” said  Rafael Camarena , an economist at Grupo
Financiero Santander Mexico SAB in Mexico City. “What’s
fundamentally changed are the conditions of global liquidity.”  Yields on benchmark government bonds due 2024 have
increased 20 basis points, or 0.2 percentage point, in the past
two weeks to 5.64 percent. The yield fell five basis points
today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
