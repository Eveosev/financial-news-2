Canadian police have arrested two
people who intended to detonate a bomb in Victoria, British
Columbia during national holiday celebrations.  The Canadian-born suspects were “inspired by al-Qeada
ideology,” a Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer said during
a televised press conference today. “Our investigation
demonstrated that this was a domestic threat, without
international linkages.”  The people intended to use bombs made from pressure
cookers, the RCMP official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
