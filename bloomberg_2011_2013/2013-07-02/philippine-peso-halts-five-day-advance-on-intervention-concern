The Philippine peso snapped a five-day advance on speculation the central bank intervened,
suggesting the monetary authority judged the currency’s gains to
be excessive. Government bonds due 2031 declined.  The peso climbed 1.2 percent last week, the most in a year,
as foreign funds turned net buyers of local shares for the first
time in June, according to exchange data. Central bank Governor
Amando Tetangco said on June 26 that the authorities will
maintain a strategic presence in the market.  “There’s a sense there’s some intervention,” said Antonio Espedido, treasurer at China Banking Corp. in  Manila . “That
somehow capped the peso’s appreciation.”  The currency dropped 0.4 percent to 43.285 per dollar as of
11:04 a.m. in Manila. It fell to 44.20 per dollar on June 21,
the lowest level since January 2012, and lost 5.5 percent in the
quarter through June.  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. raised its
forecast for the  Philippines ’ gross domestic product growth for
this year to 7.1 percent from 6.5 percent and to 6.5 percent
from 6 percent for 2014.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the exchange rate used to price options, increased 14 basis
points, or 0.14 percentage point, to 7.80 percent.  The yield on the 8 percent sovereign bonds due July 2031
climbed 10 basis points to 5.05 percent, according to prices
from Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
