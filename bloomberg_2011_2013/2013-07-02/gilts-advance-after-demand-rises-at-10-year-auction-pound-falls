U.K. government bonds advanced, with
benchmark gilts rising for a second day, after demand rose at a
3.5 billion-pound ($5.31 billion) sale of 10-year securities.  Five-year gilts gained for a sixth day after  Bank of
England  Deputy Governor  Paul Tucker  told U.K. lawmakers that the
economy faces a “bumpy” road.  Mark Carney  began as governor of
the Bank of England yesterday and will lead his first policy
meeting this week. Carney must focus on boosting lending to help
maintain the recovery, the British Chambers of Commerce said.
The pound weakened against the dollar even after an industry
report showed U.K. construction expanded in June.  “There’s been a bit of a pullback in yields,” said Simon Peck, a rates strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in
London. “Today, you can attribute that to a relatively solid
2023 auction, there was pretty solid demand across the board.”  The benchmark 10-year gilt yield fell three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 2.38 percent at 1:03 p.m.  London 
time. The 1.75 percent bond maturing in September 2022 rose
0.275, or 2.75 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 94.81. The
five-year yield dropped three basis points to 1.39 percent.  The U.K. sold 2.25 percent securities due in September 2023
at an average yield of 2.584 percent, the highest at an auction
since September 2011 and up from 2.365 percent at a previous
sale on June 11. That compares with a  record-low  1.719 percent
at a sale on July 12, 2012.  Investors bid for  1.76 times  the number of securities on
offer, up from 1.52 times at the previous auction.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 3.2 percent this year
through yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.
German bonds dropped 1.6 percent and Treasuries declined 2.8
percent, the indexes show.  The pound declined 0.3 percent to $1.5169 after falling to
$1.5157, the lowest level since May 31. Sterling was little
changed at 85.86 pence per euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
