Time is running out for western
powers and Iran to engage in constructive talks over the Persian
Gulf country’s nuclear program, a former chief of Iran’s Atomic
Energy Organization said.  “We are reaching the end of the game,” Gholam Reza
Aghazadeh, who resigned from the agency in July 2009 after
leading it for 12 years, told the  Islamic Republic News Agency 
in an interview published today. “Both the Islamic republic and
Western nations must enter into serious negotiations.”  President-elect Hassan Rohani last month pledged to bring
more transparency to  Iran’s nuclear program  in a bid to roll
back some U.S. and European Union economic sanctions.  Iran and world powers failed to reach an accord after
several rounds of nuclear negotiations over the past year.
Iran’s interlocutors are calling for a halt in enrichment of
uranium to 20 percent purity. The Islamic republic says it is
entitled to carry out the work and needs the medium-enriched
uranium for isotopes to treat cancer patients. The U.S. and its
allies say it may further enrich the uranium to create material
to build nuclear weapons.  “Iran and the Westerners must win each other’s trust,”
Aghazadeh said according to IRNA. “It’s a mutual issue.”  The Atomic Energy Organization was established over three
decades ago to supervise  Iran ’s atomic research. The agency is
in charge of planning and logistics of Iranian nuclear
activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
