Allstate Corp. (ALL) , the largest publicly
traded U.S. home and auto insurer, said it will cut about 379
employees next month, or about 1 percent of its workforce, by
closing a call center in Woodridge, Illinois.  The call center will close on Aug. 11, Chris Bauer, a
spokesman for Northbrook, Illinois-based Allstate, said today in
an e-mailed statement. The  Chicago Tribune  reported Allstate’s
plans earlier today.  “More of our calls are now being sent directly to our
agencies,” Bauer said. “This has resulted in lower call
volumes to our call centers, so the difficult decision was
made.”  Allstate had about 38,000 full-time employees at year-end,
according to a filing. It is among insurers including Axa SA and
Sun Life Financial Inc. that have sought to sell life and
annuities assets as low interest rates pressure returns.  The Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic
Opportunity said in a  report  today that Allstate notified the
state in June that it will cut 348 jobs in Woodridge next month
and 31 in Northbrook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
