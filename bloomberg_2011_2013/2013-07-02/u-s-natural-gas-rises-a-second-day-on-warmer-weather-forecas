Natural gas rose for a second day in
New York on speculation that above-normal temperatures in the
Eastern U.S. may stoke demand for cooling.  Gas for August delivery increased as much as 0.6 percent
today in electronic trading and was up less than 0.1 percent at
$3.579 per million British thermal units on the New York
Mercantile Exchange as of 3 p.m. Singapore time. The contract
rose 0.3 percent yesterday to $3.577.  The MDA Weather Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland ,
forecast above-normal Northeast temperatures that will include
days of moderate weather. While the forecast turned hotter for
the Northeast heading into mid-July, parts of the South and
Central states will see cooler weather, MDA said.  The high temperature in New York City on July 9 may be 90
degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius), 6 degrees above normal, before
dropping to the high 70s on July 12, according to AccuWeather
Inc. in State College,  Pennsylvania .  Dallas  may see a high of 90
degrees on July 12, 6 lower than the usual reading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
