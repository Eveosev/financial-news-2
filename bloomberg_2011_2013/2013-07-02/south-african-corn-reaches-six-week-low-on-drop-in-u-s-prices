South African corn futures fell for
an eighth session to a six-week low after prices dropped in the
U.S., the world’s largest producer of the grain.  White corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, slid 0.6 percent to 2,236.40 rand ($225.40) a metric
ton by the close on the South African Futures Exchange in
Johannesburg. That was the lowest since May 21 and the longest
losing streak since Feb. 11. The yellow variety for delivery in
September declined 0.4 percent to 2,176 rand a ton.  U.S. farmers seeded 97.4 million acres with corn, the most
since 1936, the Department of Agriculture reported June 28. The
grain for delivery in December slumped for an eighth session
yesterday in Chicago trading.  “We are following the U.S. after they had an excellent
development in their new crop,” Brink van Wyk, a trader at BVG
(Pty) Ltd., said by phone from  Pretoria  today. “They are
planting more.”  South Africa  is the continent’s largest producer of corn.
Meal from the white variety is a staple food, while yellow corn
is mainly used as  animal feed .  Wheat for delivery in December lost 0.5 percent to 3,332
rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
