Former Philadelphia Phillies All-Star
catcher Darren Daulton had surgery to remove two brain tumors,
and next will have radiation and speech treatments.  Daulton, 51, hadn’t been feeling well in recent weeks and
was struggling to fully express himself, prompting him to visit
a doctor who discovered the tumors. His diagnosis was disclosed
last week in a statement released by  97.5 The Fanatic  radio
station in Philadelphia, on which Daulton hosts a show.  Daulton was sedated and awake yesterday as the tumors were
removed, so doctors could talk to him during the seven-hour
procedure to avoid any damage to his speech functions. Kevin
Judy, who performed the surgery at Thomas Jefferson University
Hospital in Philadelphia, said the main uncertainty in Daulton’s
recovery process will be his speaking ability.  “Strength is not a concern,” Judy was quoted as saying by
MLB.com. “The concern is his language function. The problems he
had been having brought this to attention, and we’ll have to see
how that evolves.”  Daulton played 14 seasons in Philadelphia from 1983 to 1996
before a final season with the  Florida Marlins , who won the
 World Series . He was also on the Phillies’ team that took the
National League pennant in 1993.  Daulton had a .245 career batting average with 137 home
runs and 588 runs batted in, earning All-Star Game invitations
in 1992, 1993 and 1995.  Nicknamed “Dutch,” Daulton hosts the 97.5 radio show
“Talking Baseball With Dutch.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
