Sharp Corp. (6753) , a Japanese solar panel
maker, is considering building a 38-megawatt solar power station
in northern Japan.  The plant may be built in Tomakomai city, Hokkaido,  Miyuki Nakayama , a Sharp spokeswoman, said by phone today, declining to
confirm details included in a June 29 story in the Nikkei
newspaper. No decision has been made on the plant, she said.  The station may cost more than 10 billion yen ($100
million) and start running as early as 2015, Nikkei reported,
without saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
