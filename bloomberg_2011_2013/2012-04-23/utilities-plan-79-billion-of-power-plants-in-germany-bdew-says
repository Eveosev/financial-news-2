Utilities and investors plan to
spend 60 billion euros ($79 billion) to build and modernize
 power plants  in Germany as the country closes its nuclear
reactors over the coming decade, the BDEW utility lobby said.  The 84 projects, of which 69 are at least in the permitting
stages and scheduled to start operating by 2020, have a combined
capacity of 42,056 megawatts, the BDEW said in an e-mailed
statement today. They include 23 sea-based wind farms, 29 gas-
fired stations, 17 coal generators and 10 hydro-power pump
stations, it said.  While the investments by companies including EON AG,  RWE AG (RWE) 
and  Iberdrola SA (IBE)  are positive for Germany’s future energy mix,
“this shouldn’t hide the fact that there are obstacles not just
for renewable power but also coal and gas-to-power projects,”
Hildegard Mueller, the head of the BDEW, said in the statement.  Germany ,  Europe ’s biggest economy, aims by 2022 to replace
nuclear reactors that supplied about a fifth of its electricity
with renewables such as solar and wind as well as a fresh fleet
of fossil fuel-fired plants.  Chancellor Merkel  shuttered the
country’s oldest reactors last year after the accident at the
Fukushima nuclear plant in  Japan .  While authorities permitted several of the 29 gas
generators in planning, companies haven’t yet committed to the
investments amid fears that the generators won’t make money
because of fewer operating hours, Mueller said. Renewables get
priority access to the grid in Germany, wiping out earnings at
gas stations.  Utilities in Germany were losing 12.26 euros a megawatt-
hour as of 12:10 p.m. Berlin time, based on so-called clean-dark
spreads for next month that take account of gas, power and
emissions prices, compared with a profit of 20.95 euros in
October 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. U.K.
generators earned 1.82 pounds ($2.93) a megawatt-hour, down from
a profit of 7.02 pounds in October.  Politicians “must tackle” the future design of the power
market to by 2015 create conditions facilitating investments in
new generators by 2020, Mueller said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
