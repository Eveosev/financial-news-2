Oil dropped from the highest
closing price in three days in  New York  after a report showed
that Chinese consumption growth is slowing.  Futures slid as much as 1.2 percent as Chinese customs data
showed the country’s apparent oil demand dropped to the lowest
level since October. A separate report indicated Chinese
manufacturing may shrink for a sixth month. Hedge funds and
other money managers raised bullish bets on  Brent crude ,
according to data from ICE Futures Europe exchange.  “Negative data from China is contributing to oil’s
weakness today,” said  Christopher Bellew , a senior broker at
Jefferies Bache Ltd. in London, who correctly predicted Brent’s
advance to $120 a barrel earlier this year. “Brent has slipped
into a lower range.”  Crude for June delivery fell as much as $1.19 to $102.69 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
and was at $102.79 at 1:16 p.m. London time. The contract
climbed 1.1 percent to $103.88 on April 20, the highest close
since April 17. Prices are up 4 percent this year.  Brent oil for June settlement on the London-based ICE
exchange was down 95 cents, or 0.8 percent, at $117.81 a barrel.
The European benchmark contract was at a premium of $14.85 to
New York futures, compared with $14.88 on April 20.  Slowing Growth  China’s apparent oil demand dropped to 9.51 million barrels
a day in March, the lowest level since October, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg based on customs data released today.
The measure is calculated by adding production and net imports
of oil products.  China  accounted for 11 percent of the world’s oil
consumption in 2010, compared with 21 percent for the U.S.,
according to BP Plc’s Statistical Review of World Energy. China
raised retail gasoline and diesel prices last month, which the
 International Energy Agency  said may reduce demand further.  “Traditionally strong second-quarter demand, with diesel
demand supported by the spring ploughing season, should be
restrained in the second quarter of this year,” the agency said
in its monthly Oil Market Report on April 12.  Manufacturing may contract this month, according to a
preliminary reading of a purchasing managers index for China by
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics. It came in at 49.1 for
April, compared with a final 48.3 in March. A number below 50
points to a contraction.  Bullish Bets  Hedge funds  and other money managers raised bullish bets on
Brent crude by 545 contracts in the week ended April 17,
according to ICE data.  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 122,884 lots,
the London-based exchange said today in its weekly Commitment of
Traders report.  Money managers, including hedge funds, commodity pools and
commodity trading advisers, increased bullish oil wagers by
7,477, or 3.9 percent, to 199,304 futures and options combined
in the seven days ended April 17, according to the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s Commitments of Traders
report on April 20. That’s the first gain in five weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
