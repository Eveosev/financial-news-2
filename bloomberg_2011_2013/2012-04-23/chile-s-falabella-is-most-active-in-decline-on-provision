SACI Falabella (FALAB) ,  Chile ’s largest
retailer by market value, retreated the most in a week after
announcing a $40 million provision at its credit card unit.  Falabella slid 1.7 percent to 4,625 pesos at 10:25 a.m. and
declined as much as 2.8 percent, the biggest intraday drop since
April 13. The stock was the most active in Santiago trading with
2.3 billion pesos ($4.7 million) changing hands.  Credit card unit Promotora CMR Falabella SA will set aside
$40 million to cover funds unduly retained by Cuentas Punto Com
SA, an online bill-paying system, Falabella said in a statement
posted April 20 on the website of Chile’s securities regulator.  “We are expecting a year-on-year decrease in first-quarter
net income of 17.4 percent given that the provision will be part
of the financial results of the first quarter,” Banco Santander
SA’s analysts Francisco Errandonea and Adolfo Ortuzar wrote in
an e-mailed note to clients today.  A representative of Grupo Capitales, which owns Cuentas
Punto Com, was not immediately available to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
