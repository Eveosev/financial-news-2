Hellenic Telecommunications
Organization SA (HTO) , Greece’s largest phone company, is planning to
reduce its staff by about 2,000 people in a voluntary redundancy
program,  Imerisia  reported, without saying how it got the
information.  Most of the reductions will be from staff nearing
retirement, and the program will reduce the company’s operating
costs by about 150 million euros ($197 million) over the next
three years, the Athens-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
