Philippine bonds gained after
policy makers cut the 2013 inflation forecast, following
official data that showed prices rose at the slowest pace in 30
months in March. The peso dropped.  Inflation will probably average 3.3 percent next year,
compared with a previous prediction of 3.4 percent, central bank
Deputy Governor Diwa Guinigundo said on April 19. The  Bureau of
Internal Revenue  collected 75.2 billion pesos ($1.8 billion) in
March, an increase of 3.64 billion pesos from a year earlier,
the tax office reported today. Collections missed the goal of
82.26 billion pesos, the government said in a  Twitter account .  “There’s a sense that inflation may remain benign, which
is translating to better prices for  government securities ,”
said Rafael Algarra, executive vice president of financial
markets at Security Bank Corp. in  Manila .  The yield on the 6.5 percent bonds due April 2021 fell five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 5.35 percent as of
4:13 p.m. in Manila, according to ICAP Plc.  The peso slipped 0.2 percent to 42.673 per dollar, prices
from Tullett Prebon Plc showed. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, dropped
to 5.1 percent from 5.3 percent.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas kept its benchmark  interest
rate  at a record-low 4 percent last week and held the inflation
estimate for this year at 3.1 percent. The central bank’s
official price target is an average 3 percent to 5 percent for
this year and next. The cost of goods in the economy rose 2.6
percent in March, slowing from 2.7 percent the previous month.  Foreign investment totaled $158 million last month after
outflows of $305 million in February, Bangko Sentral reported on
April 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
