Ottawa Senators captain Daniel Alfredsson said he will return from a concussion tonight against
the  New York Rangers  in Game 6 of their opening-round playoff
series, after being sidelined the last three games.  Alfredsson, 39, told reporters after practice that he will
play tonight at Scotiabank Place in Ottawa, the National Hockey
League team said on its Twitter page. The Senators lead the
best-of-seven series, 3-2.  A six-time All-Star, Alfredsson suffered a concussion in
the second period of the Senators’ 3-2 overtime victory in Game
2 when he was elbowed in the head by Rangers forward Carl
Hagelin. Hagelin will also return to the lineup after serving a
three-game ban for the hit.  Alfredsson has spent his entire 16-year career in Ottawa.
He’s led the team in scoring five times, and his 1,082 career
points rank fourth among active NHL players.  To contact the reporter on this story:
