Norway’s Board of Forensic Medicine
had objections to the second evaluation that found confessed
mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik to be sane and asked for
additional information.  The board demanded more investigation into Breivik’s
childhood and the time he was living with his mother among other
issues, Judge Arne Lyng said today at the end of the sixth day
of the trial.  The second evaluation, which was released this month, found
the 33-year-old not to be psychotic and therefore
accountable for his actions. The assessment contradicted an
evaluation from last year, which concluded that he was
delusional and suffers from paranoid schizophrenia, meaning he
would face compulsory treatment, potentially for life, rather
than prison.  To contact the reporter on this story:
