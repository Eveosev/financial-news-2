The International Monetary Fund’s
doubling of pledges to its defense fund to more than $430
billion last week is adequate to combat further threats from
 Europe ’s debt crisis, said IMF First Deputy Managing Director
 David Lipton .  Countries now must turn from emergency steps to balancing
budgets and building sustainable longer-term spending plans,
Lipton said today in an interview on Bloomberg Radio’s
“Bloomberg Surveillance” with Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt.  “The firewalls are very reasonably sized for the risks
that we see out there and it’s time for everyone now to turn the
focus to how to avoid ever needing to use them,” Lipton said of
the financial defenses set up by the IMF and European
governments.  “I don’t think there’s any firewall that can substitute
for a good set of policies, countries grappling with their
fiscal problems and establishing credible policies for the
future,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
