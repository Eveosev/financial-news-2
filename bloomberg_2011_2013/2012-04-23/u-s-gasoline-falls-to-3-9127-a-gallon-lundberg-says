The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. filling stations fell 5.44 cents to $3.9127 a
gallon, according to  Lundberg Survey Inc.   The survey covers the two-week period ended April 20 and is
based on information received from about 2,500 stations by the
Camarillo, California-based company. The price is 3.27 cents
higher than a year earlier, when the average was $3.88.  Relatively stable crude-oil prices coupled with
“sufficient supplies” of gasoline have led to the price drop,
 Trilby Lundberg , president of Lundberg Survey, said yesterday in
a telephone interview. The decline was the first in her twice-
monthly surveys since December, she said.  The average U.S. price has fallen 5 cents since peaking so
far this year on April 6, when the average was $3.9671, Lundberg
said. In  California , where prices had climbed to an average of
$4.3162 on March 9 due to reduced production at West Coast
refineries, the average price has fallen in the past six weeks
to $4.1669.  “Gasoline prices have slipped, and if crude-oil prices
remain stable, then we may see another 5 cent to 10 cent decline
at the pump,” Lundberg said.  The price of gasoline has become an issue in the 2012  U.S.
presidential election . President  Barack Obama  urged Congress on
April 17 to bolster federal supervision of oil markets,
including bigger penalties for market manipulation and greater
power for regulators to increase the amount of money traders
must put up to back their energy bets.  ‘Short End’  “We can’t afford a situation where some speculators can
reap millions, while millions of American families get the short
end of the stick,” Obama said in remarks in the White House
Rose Garden.  Mitt Romney , the likely Republican nominee, has accused the
Obama administration of thwarting domestic oil production
through regulations.  Prices fell as West Texas Intermediate crude in  New York 
was little changed in the two weeks ended April 20. Crude for
May delivery on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  fell 26 cents,
or 0.3 percent, to $103.05 a barrel.  Prices also fell as the London benchmark crude, Brent, has
weakened relative to WTI. A weaker Brent compared with U.S.
benchmark West Texas Intermediate oil can reduce the cost of
imports from  Europe  and of fuel refined on the East and Gulf
coasts, where refineries process crude priced off Brent.  The  premium of Brent , traded on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange, to Nymex-traded WTI, based on June
contracts, was $14.88 on April 20, down from $20.12 two weeks
before.  Gasoline Futures  Gasoline futures on the Nymex fell 19.78 cents, or 5.9
percent to $3.1427 a gallon in the two weeks ended April 20.
Since March 26, when gasoline reached $3.4166, the front-month
contract has fallen 8 percent, narrowing the year-to-date gain
to 17 percent.  Oil may fall this week on speculation that a slowing U.S.
economic recovery will reduce demand, a Bloomberg News survey
showed.  Seventeen of 30 analysts, or 57 percent, forecast oil will
decline through April 27. Seven respondents, or 23 percent,
predicted prices will rise and six estimated there will be
little change. Last week, 49 percent of surveyed analysts
expected a decline.  On  Long Island , regular gasoline fell to $4.14 a gallon,
according to Lundberg. Los Angeles-area retail stations averaged
$4.1824.  The highest price in the lower 48 U.S. states among the
cities surveyed was in  Chicago , where the average was $4.26 a
gallon, Lundberg said. The lowest price was in Tulsa,  Oklahoma ,
where customers paid an average of $3.52 a gallon.  To contact the reporters on this story:
