Phil Falcone ’s Harbinger Capital
Partners made a $48 million payment on its $190 million loan
from  Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF) , a week early and a half million
dollars more than what’s due on April 30, according to a person
familiar with the fund.  Jefferies lent New York-based Harbinger the money in
January at an effective interest rate of 24 percent. Harbinger
owes another $47.5 million at the end of July and the balance on
Oct. 31.  Falcone raised money for the loan by selling assets, said
the person, who asked not to be named because the fund is
private. Lew Phelps, a spokesman for Harbinger, declined to
comment.  Harbinger’s biggest asset is a majority stake in
LightSquared Inc., a company that planned to build a nationwide
U.S. broadband network. The Federal Communications Commission
pulled its permission in February for the network, citing
interference with global-positioning devices used in navigating
everything from fighter jets to minivans.  LightSquared had made an outstanding $56.3 million payment
to Britain’s  Inmarsat Plc (ISAT)  related to a spectrum-cooperation
accord and was granted an extension on further installments,
gaining more time to win approval from U.S. regulators for a
wireless service.  The broadband venture won’t need to make any additional
payments until April 2014 as part of the new agreement,
Inmarsat, the biggest provider of satellite services to the
maritime industry, said in an April 20 statement. LightSquared
will no longer be in default, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
