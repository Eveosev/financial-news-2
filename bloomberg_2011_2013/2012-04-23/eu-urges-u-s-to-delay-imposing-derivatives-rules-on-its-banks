The European Union is urging the
U.S. to delay enforcing over-the-counter derivatives rules on EU
banks amid concerns that the measures are unclear and may create
unnecessary costs.  Requirements for EU-based banks and other companies to
register with U.S. regulators “are creating confusion” for
firms operating in the U.S.,  Chantal Hughes , a spokeswoman for
 Michel Barnier , the EU’s financial services commissioner, said
in an e-mail.  Barnier has sent letters to U.S. regulators this month
“encouraging them to delay” the process “until there is legal
clarity about the substantive conditions that such registration
will entail,” Hughes said. The commissioner is seeking
“further in-depth discussion and collaboration” on the rules,
she said.  The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and
Securities and Exchange Commission adopted criteria last week
defining which firms will face requirements that are being drawn
up for companies involved in OTC derivatives trading.  The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 called for most OTC trading to
be guaranteed by central clearinghouses and traded on exchanges
or other platforms. It also sets out rules governing clearing,
trading and capital that are being fleshed out by regulators.  Global regulators in the Financial Stability Board have
called for nations to regulate OTC derivatives by end-2012,
including by pushing trades through clearinghouses. EU
legislators approved measures to do this last month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
