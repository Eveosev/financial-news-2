Kellogg Co. (K)  said it expects to have
2012 profit of $3.18 to $3.30 per share, reducing its outlook
for the year after a first quarter in which sales fell 1.3
percent.  First-quarter preliminary earnings were $1 a share,
including a 5-cent benefit on hedges related to Kelloggâ€™s
planned purchase of the Pringles brand. The company said sales
were weaker than it expected in  Europe  and in some U.S. product
lines.  For the year, Kellogg had expected $3.24 to $3.37 in
profit. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected $3.48.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
