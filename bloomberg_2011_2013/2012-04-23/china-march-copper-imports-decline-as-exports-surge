Refined-copper  imports  by China
declined 8 percent in March from a month earlier while exports
surged on high inventories and tepid demand.  Inbound shipments were 345,667 metric tons last month,
according to data e-mailed by the General Administration of
Customs today. This compares with 375,831 tons in February and
192,161 tons a year ago. Exports totaled 26,537 tons, the
highest since April 2011, customs data showed.  Re-exports of the metal may help run down domestic supplies
as manufacturing is poised to shrink for a sixth month in the
world’s second-largest economy. Stockpiles at Shanghai Futures
Exchange-monitored warehouses declined most in four months last
week, losing 4.8 percent to 211,170 tons.  “April exports will probably be even higher than March,”
said Wang Lixin, a Beijing-based analyst with researcher
Custeel.com. “The domestic market faces huge pressure from the
high inventories, which should cap imports in coming months.”  Inventories at bonded warehouses, which are located in
 Shanghai ’s free-trade zones, were about 600,000 tons, compared
with less than 100,000 tons in 2008, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
said in a report on April 19. Inventories at LME warehouses in
 Asia  climbed to 38,625 tons, a four-month high, as of April 20.  The metal for immediate-delivery on Changjiang Nonferrous
Metals Market in Shanghai was quoted at a discount of about 70
yuan ($11) a ton to the front-month futures contract on the
Shanghai exchange today.  ‘Bad News’  “The bad news is that copper fabricators now even have
inventories of their products, which was rarely seen in the
past,” Wang said.  China’s flash purchasing manager index stood at 49.1 for
April, according to a preliminary reading from HSBC Holdings Plc
and Markit Economics today. This indicates manufacturing may
shrink for a sixth month in April, as a number below 50 points
to a contraction.  Real copper demand grew 4.6 percent in the first quarter in
 China , and net imports in the April-to-June period are likely to
fall to 720,000 tons from 1.07 million tons in the first
quarter, China International Capital Corp. analysts led by James Luke said in a research report on April 18.  “Although downstream consumption is not good, financing
demand will prevent any sharp decline in imports,”
Custeel.com’s Wang said. Trading companies receive a letter of
credit for copper imports and then get a window of a few months
of cheap loans. They can sell the metal and use the proceeds for
higher-yielding investments, or submit a warehouse receipt or a
warrant to use it as collateral for a discounted loan.  China’s copper  concentrate  imports rose 18 percent in March
from a year ago to 530,606 tons, leading total arrivals in the
first quarter to rise 24 percent to 1.76 million tons, customs
data showed today.  Inbound shipments of primary aluminum surged to 63,634
tons, while exports advanced to 12,288 tons last month,
according to the customs data.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
