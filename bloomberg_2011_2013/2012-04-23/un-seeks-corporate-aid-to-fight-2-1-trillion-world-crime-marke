The  United Nations  wants corporate
aid to fight corruption and stem a global crime market estimated
to generate $2.1 trillion of illicit profit annually, officials
at the UN Office on Drugs and Crime said.  The UN is in talks with a “handful” of companies willing
to donate $2 million each to fund anti-corruption programs,
UNODC Executive Director Yury Fedotov said today in an interview
in Vienna. Fedotov said he hatched the idea in Davos,
 Switzerland , at the  World Economic Forum .  “The private sector is suffering from corruption,” he
said. “We estimate that about 10 percent of business earnings
are lost as a result of corruption.”  The UN is trying to tap corporate aid as governments cut
spending and curtail services because of weak economies. The
UN’s Convention Against Corruption, which calls for cooperation
between government officials and company executives, is overseen
by the Vienna-based UNODC, which wants the extra money to help
countries adopt laws, improve legislation and collect good
practices.  “We don’t have money because our budget is funded by
voluntary contributions,” Fedotov said. “Member-state
capacities are exhausted.”  The UNODC, using World Bank data, estimates that criminals
earn $2.1 trillion annually through human trafficking, drug
smuggling,  identity theft  and other illicit activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
