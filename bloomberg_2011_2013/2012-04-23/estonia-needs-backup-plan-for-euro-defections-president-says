Estonia, which adopted the euro at
the start of last year, needs a “plan B” to weather defections
from the single-currency region, President Toomas Ilves said.  “We must be honest with ourselves and the European Union
in general,” Ilves said in a meeting with Finnish Prime
Minister  Jyrki Katainen  in Tallinn today. “We also need to be
prepared for considerable future changes to the current euro
area, where some of us will move on and others will remain.”  Estonia and  Finland , “with their responsible and
conservative fiscal policy, have repeatedly proven that they are
among those that are making progress,” Ilves said in comments
distributed by e-mail after the talks.  Estonia, whose  public debt  stood at 6 percent of gross
domestic product at the end of 2011, is among the three least
risky euro states. Its five-year credit-default swaps closed at
110 basis points yesterday, behind Finland’s 76 basis points and
 Germany ’s 87 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
