London Mayor  Boris Johnson ’s lead
over his Labour challenger,  Ken Livingstone , narrowed to two
percentage points in the latest poll before next week’s
election, reflecting a fall in support for the government.  Johnson, the candidate of Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s
Conservative Party, led Livingstone by 51 percent to 49 percent
in a head-to-head contest between the two main challengers,
according to the YouGov Plc poll for the Evening Standard
newspaper. Johnson had a six-point lead in the last YouGov poll
published a week ago.  The poll showed Labour had the support of 50 percent of
voters in the capital, extending its lead over the Tories to 19
points from 17 points. Backing for Cameron’s government has
fallen since the March 21 budget, criticized by Labour for
helping the rich at the expense of pensioners and charities. The
prime minister said today the government needs to “do better.”  “The narrowing of the polls is Ken gaining from the rising
national tide of Labour support and the coalition government’s
troubles, rather than any improvement in the public’s perception
of him personally,” YouGov pollster  Anthony Wells  wrote on his
 UK Polling Report website .  YouGov questioned 1,138 London adults from April 20 to
yesterday for  its survey , for which it didn’t give a margin of
error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
