Sony Corp. (6758) ’s ambition to create
synergies between its hardware-making  units  and software
affiliates is “an illusion,” said Yasunori Tateishi, author of
‘Sayonara! Bokurano Sony’ - or Goodbye Our Sony.  Tateishi spoke to reporters in Tokyo today.  “Sony hasn’t been able to create synergies between its
hardware and software sections for a long time, but the company
hasn’t even realized that.  ‘‘Sony makes  DVD players . Has Sony’s picture unit ever
provided content freely to buyers of Sony DVD players? It never
worked because of copyright issues. I believe it’s an illusion
that synergies can be created between the company’s software
units and hardware units.  ‘‘It may be difficult for president Kazuo Hirai’s team to
unload non-core businesses such music and film. An easier way
may be to sell those affiliates to public and use the proceeds
to revive its electronics businesses.  ‘‘Then the affiliates can be run independently. They can
work with Sony only when it’s the best for them to do so. That
is an ideal way of restructuring the company from my point of
view.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
