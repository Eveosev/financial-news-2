The  World Bank  will provide $300
million to Serbia this year to support reforms, including
restructuring of state-owned companies,  Tanjug  news agency
reported, citing Deputy Finance Minister Goran Radosavljevic.  An initial $100 million is expected “during the summer”
and the rest in November, the newswire quoted the official as
saying during a visit to  Washington .  An International Monetary Fund delegation will visit Serbia
immediately after the country’s May 6 general elections to
discuss the possible unfreezing of a $1.3 billion precautionary
loan program, the newswire also reported, citing Radosavljevic.
The arrangement was suspended earlier this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
