The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Argentine trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and share prices are as of 3:18 p.m. in Buenos
Aires. The  Merval (MERVAL)  index fell 1.2 percent to 2,309.60.  Empresa Distribuidora & Comercializadora Norte SA (EDN)  ,
Argentina’s largest power distributor, rose 1.4 percent to 0.74
pesos, ending a seven-day losing streak. Investors are using
last week’s 6.5 percent drop in the Merval index to buy some of
the country’s most-active stocks such as Edenor, said Leonardo Chialva, a partner at Buenos Aires-based asset manager Delphos
Investment, in a phone interview.  Tenaris SA (TEN)   fell 1.3 percent to 96.20 pesos in its
third straight day of losses. The world’s largest producer of
seamless-steel pipes used in the oil industry declined in line
with the price of crude.  YPF SA (YPFD AF) dropped 5.5 percent to 77.50 pesos. The
newspaper La Nacion reported Argentina aims to pay nothing for
the 51 percent of  YPF SA (YPFD)  it seized from  Repsol YPF SA (REP)  last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
