The German government has abandoned
an attempt to fend off a lawsuit by the European Commission on
turning European guidelines on data retention into law,  Bild 
said, citing unidentified people close to the European Union.  An agreement between the interior and justice ministries
won’t be reached in time to fend off a lawsuit and “massive
fines” could result, the German newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
