Poland’s benchmark  WIG20 Index (WIG20) 
slumped the most in more than five months as data showed
manufacturing shrank in the euro-area and China.  The gauge declined 2.5 percent to 2,167.13, the steepest
decline since Nov. 21 by the close in Warsaw trading.  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS) , the country’s second-largest oil refiner,
and  Synthos SA (SNS) , the chemicals producer controlled by Polish
billionaire Michal Solowow, were among the biggest decliners.  Euro-area services and manufacturing contracted more than
estimated in April, to a five-month low. Chinese manufacturing
also shrank for a sixth month in April, according to a survey of
companies. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte offered his Cabinet’s
resignation after one of the parties in his minority coalition
withdrew support.  The  SXXP Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  lost 2.3 percent to 251.75 at
4:36 p.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
