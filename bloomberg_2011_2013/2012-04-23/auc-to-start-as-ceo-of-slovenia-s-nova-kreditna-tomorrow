Ales Hauc will take the helm of
 Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor (KBMR)  d.d. tomorrow after he won approval
from the central bank to become the chief executive officer of
Slovenia’s biggest publicly traded lender.  Hauc, 48, was appointed last month and will lead the bank
for a five-year period, the Maribor-based lender said in an e-
mailed statement today. He will replace Andrej Plos, who
resigned less than two months on the job. Plos was named to the
post after the previous chief, Matjaz Kovacic, stepped down in
December.  Hauc will have to tackle rising bad loans at Slovenia’s
second biggest lender by assets, which said last week that its
2011 loss was 81 million euros ($106 million), revising an
earlier figure of 53.6 million euros reported on March 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
