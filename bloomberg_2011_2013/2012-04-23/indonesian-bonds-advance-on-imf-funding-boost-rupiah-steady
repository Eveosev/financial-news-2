Indonesia ’s rupiah and bonds fell,
pushing 10-year yields to snap a three-day decline, after
 Standard & Poor’s  kept the nation’s rating unchanged.  S&P maintained its assessment of Indonesia’s sovereign debt
at BB+, one step below investment grade, it said in a statement
today. The rating agency said the country’s plan to lure
investment is at risk from “policy slippages” such as the
administration’s failure to reduce fuel subsidies. The nation is
rated investment grade at Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch
Ratings.  “S&P’s delay in upgrading Indonesia resulted in downward
pressure for the rupiah and the  bond market ,” said Putu Andi
Wijaya, a Jakarta-based foreign-exchange dealer at PT Bank
Rakyat Indonesia. “There was expectation that S&P would follow
in the footsteps of Moody’s and Fitch.”  The  yield  on the 7 percent bonds due May 2022 climbed one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.90 percent,
according to closing prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association. The yield fell four basis points this month.  The rupiah dropped 0.1 percent to 9,188 per dollar as of
4:34 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency has declined 0.3 percent
this month. One-month implied volatility, which measures
exchange-rate swings used to price options, was unchanged at 6.5
percent for a third day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
