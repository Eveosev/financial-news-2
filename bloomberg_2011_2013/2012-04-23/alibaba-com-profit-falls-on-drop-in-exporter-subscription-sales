Alibaba.com Ltd. (1688) , the unit of
China’s biggest e-commerce company that’s under a buyout offer,
reported its smallest quarterly profit in two years after
selling fewer website subscriptions to exporters.  Net income declined to 339.2 million yuan ($54 million), or
0.07 yuan a share, from 452.5 million yuan, or 0.09 yuan, a year
earlier, Alibaba.com said in a statement yesterday. Profit
missed the 468 million yuan median of four analysts’ estimates
in a Bloomberg survey, and was the lowest since the first
quarter of 2010. Revenue rose 3.7 percent to 1.59 billion yuan.  Parent Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., controlled by
billionaire Jack Ma, said in February it may offer as much as
HK$19.6 billion ($2.5 billion) to buy out minority shareholders
at Alibaba.com. The unit’s export-promotion business weakened
after February 2011, when it said it would tighten vendors
screening on its website after some buyers were defrauded.  “The company has been undergoing a business
transformation,” Richard Ji, an analyst at Morgan Stanley,
wrote in an April 20 report. “Alibaba.com has been under
pressure due to its exposure to  China ’s export business.”  Alibaba.com was unchanged at HK$13.30 in  Hong Kong  trading
yesterday. In February, Alibaba Group said it will buy the
Alibaba.com shares it doesn’t own at HK$13.50 each.  Subscribers for Alibaba.com’s Gold Supplier program for
Chinese exporters fell more than 11,000 last quarter to 87,544
the company said. In 2011, Alibaba lost more than 22,000 Gold
Supplier members.  Membership Revenue  The company posted a drop in membership revenue last
quarter compared with a year earlier, while spending on product
development and upgrades increased operating expenses 8.2
percent, Alibaba.com said yesterday.  The plan for a “complete transformation” of the business
is expected to “adversely affect our revenue growth” in the
future, the company said in its earnings statement.  Alibaba.com is the unit of Hangzhou, China-based Alibaba
Group that is focused on business owners. The closely held
parent, 40 percent-owned by  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) , also operates online
commerce businesses such as Taobao and Juhuasuan that are aimed
at consumers.  The proposed buyout of Alibaba.com will let the unit
reorganize for the long term, free from the “pressure of market
expectations,” Alibaba Group said in February.  Minority Alibaba.com shareholders should approve the
buyout, said Somerley Ltd., a financial firm hired by the
Chinese company to advise independent directors. The
recommendation was included in a circular Alibaba filed to the
Hong Kong exchange yesterday.  The company will hold a shareholders meeting on May 25 to
vote on the buyout, according to the circular.  Ma sold 12 million shares in parent Alibaba Group at $13.50
each in two transactions between October and December, according
to the circular. He now owns 185.97 million Alibaba Group
shares,a 7.41 percent stake, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
