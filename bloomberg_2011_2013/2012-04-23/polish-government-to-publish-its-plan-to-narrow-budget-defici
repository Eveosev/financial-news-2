Poland will publish its euro-
convergence plan today to show how the largest economy among the
European Union’s eastern members will cut its budget deficit to
maintain the inflow of grants from the trading bloc.  Finance Minister  Jacek Rostowski  will release the plan at
10:50 a.m. in Warsaw before submitting it to Brussels along with
a so-called fiscal notification on 2011 economic growth, the
budget deficit and public debt. The statistics office will
report the data at 11 a.m.  Poland must convince the EU it is able to cut its deficit
to within the bloc’s limit of 3 percent of gross domestic
product this year to escape cuts in grants. The funds helped the
country avoid a recession in 2009 and are set to keep economic
expansion at the fastest pace in the 27-nation bloc this year at
2.5 percent, according to the EU.  Poland targets a deficit of 2.9 percent of GDP this year.
The goal is “a bit too optimistic, though  deficit reduction  to
below 3.5 percent will enable Poland to leave the excessive
budget procedure,”  Piotr Kalisz , chief economist at Citibank’s
Polish unit, said in a note to clients on April 18.  The convergence plan will show cutting the shortfall to 0.9
percent of GDP in 2015, the PAP news service reported on April
17, citing the convergence plan. PAP didn’t say how it obtained
the document and the  Finance Ministry  didn’t confirm the
information.  Last year’s deficit was 5.1 percent of GDP, Belka said on
April 12, which is 0.5 percentage point less than the
government’s target.  To contact the reporters on this story:
