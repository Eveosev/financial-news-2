Canadian natural gas rose amid
forecasts of cooler-than-normal weather in the U.S. Midwest and
Northeast that could boost furnace use.  Alberta  gas rose 6 percent. Demand for heat in the Midwest
will be 37 percent above normal through April 30 and the
Northeast will top seasonal norms by 25 percent, according to
Weather Derivatives. Chicago’s low May 1 will drop to 40 degrees
Fahrenheit (4 Celsius), 7 degrees below normal, forecaster
AccuWeather Inc. said.  “We’re getting a bit of a bounce,” said Brad Florer, a
trader with Kottke Associates in Louisville,  Kentucky . “With
the cooler temperatures we’re seeing, it’s a bit of a knee-jerk
bullish reaction.”  Alberta gas for May delivery advanced 8.75 cents to C$1.535
a gigajoule ($1.47 per million British thermal units) as of 4
p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.
NGX gas is down 46 percent this year.  Natural gas for May delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose 8 cents to settle at $2.007 per million Btu.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago gained
4.02 cents, or 2 percent, to $2.0353 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas advanced 7.53 cents, or 4.4 percent, to $1.7728
per million Btu. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded
for California markets, prices rose 8.41 cents, or 4.7 percent,
to $1.8587.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.6 billion cubic
feet, 216 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.1 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.16 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at  Kingsgate  was 1.04 billion cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.61 billion cubic feet today, or 61 percent
of its capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy ’s British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.22
billion cubic feet at 2:50 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
