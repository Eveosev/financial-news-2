Chile ’s peso declined to the lowest
level since March as copper fell on signs manufacturing in China
may shrink for a sixth month and politics undermined confidence
in Europe’s economic recovery.  The currency fell 0.8 percent to 490 per  U.S. dollar  as of
10:20 a.m. in Santiago and earlier reached 490.15. The currency
has traded between 491 and 480 per dollar for more than a month.  A preliminary Chinese purchasing managers’ index indicated
manufacturing may contract in the biggest buyer of Chile’s main
export, copper. In Europe Dutch Prime Minister  Mark Rutte  will
resign after his coalition split on austerity plans and first-
round election results in France left  Nicolas Sarkozy  in second
place and dependent on votes from the anti-euro National Front
for victory in the second round.  “Bad manufacturing in China, French elections and the
early elections in the Netherlands have all generated negative
sentiment, but there’s still a lot of dollar selling at 490,’
said Cristian Donoso, a trader at Banchile Corredores de Bolsa
SA in Santiago. ‘‘If things get worse we could go through 491 to
494 or 495.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
