Workers at a hydroelectric power
plant under construction in northern  Brazil  are striking, the
group responsible for building the project said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The group, Norte Energia SA, didn’t say how many people
have walked off the job at the Belo Monte plant in Altamira. The
workers have barricaded a road lead to the construction site,
preventing vehicles from reaching the plant.  The power plant, one of country’s biggest electricity
projects, will have as much as 11,233 megawatts of capacity,
according to Norte Energia, which is backed by  Centrais
Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) , Neoenergia SA, Cemig Geracao e
Transmissao SA,  Light SA (LIGT3) ,  Vale SA (VALE3)  and pension funds.  Norte Energia said they are seeking judicial measures to
end the strike. Nobody at the workers’ union was immediately
available to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
