The Serbian central bank sold euros
to support the dinar, preventing its slide through 112 to the
euro.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije said it sold 20
million euros ($26.3 million) to “enable the smooth
functioning” of the market. The National Bank of Serbia has
sold 588.5 million euros since the start of 2012 to prop up the
dinar.  It left its  benchmark  interest rate unchanged at 9.5
percent on April 12 and amended reserve-requirement rules,
releasing foreign-currency liquidity and draining dinars to
stabilize the Serbian currency and avoid inflationary pressures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
