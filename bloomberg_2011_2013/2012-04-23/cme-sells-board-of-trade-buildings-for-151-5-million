CME Group Inc. (CME) , the world’s largest
futures exchange, sold the north and south towers of its Chicago
Board of Trade complex for about $151.5 million.  CME, which occupies 150,000 square feet (14,000 square
meters) of the 1.3 million-square-feet Art Deco property at 141
W. Jackson Blvd., will lease its space back for a 15-year term,
the Chicago-based company said in a statement today. The
buildings, put up for sale in June, were purchased by a joint
venture of GlenStar Properties LLC of Chicago and USAA Real
Estate Co. of San Antonio, Texas.  The exchange said it will continue to own the complex’s
east building, which has 288,000 square feet and no third-party
tenants. The east building’s address will be changed to 333 S.
LaSalle St., according to the statement.  CME Group was created in 2007 when the  Chicago  Mercantile
Exchange bought the Chicago Board of Trade. It purchased the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  the following year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
