Krka Group d.d. , Slovenia’s biggest
drug company, said an Oslo court ruled that its Swedish unit
breached  AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) ’s patent over the drug esomeprazole.  The Norwegian court ruled Krka infringed the patent because
the drug contained an optical purity above 98 percent, the Novo
mesto, Slovenia-based company said in a regulatory  statement 
today. Krka said it was ordered to pay AstraZeneca about 1.9
million euros ($2.5 million) to compensate for lost profit from
the reflux drug.  Krka said it will appeal the decision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
