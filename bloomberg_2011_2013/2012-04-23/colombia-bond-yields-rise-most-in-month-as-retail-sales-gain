Yields on Colombia’s peso bonds
rose the most in five weeks as retail sales increased in
February more than economists forecast, adding to speculation
the central bank will raise  interest rates  further.  “People are betting the central bank hasn’t reached the
end of its hiking cycle,” said William Florez, an analyst at
Helm Bank SA’s brokerage unit in Bogota. “Surprises like we had
with retail sales show growth remains strong.”  The yield on Colombia’s 9.25 percent peso-denominated bonds
due in May 2014 climbed eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage
point, to 5.87 percent, according to the central bank. It was
the biggest increase since March 14. The bond’s price fell 0.186
centavo to 106.357 centavos per peso.  The central bank has raised the overnight lending rate nine
times since February 2011, boosting it to 5.25 percent, from a
record low 3 percent. The next monetary-policy decision is
slated for April 30.  Colombia ’s retail sales increased 9.4 percent in February
from a year earlier, after a 4.9 percent gain in the prior
month, the national statistics agency said in an April 20
report. The median forecast of 15 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey was for a 6.4 percent advance.  The peso erased an earlier drop, gaining 0.1 percent to
1,769.83 per dollar from 1,771.10 on April 20. The currency is
up 9.5 percent this year, the biggest rally among all of the
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The Colombian currency will strengthen to 1,725 at the end
of the year amid rising foreign direct investment flows into the
South American country, according to HSBC Holdings Plc.  HSBC View  HSBC revised its 2012 year-end peso estimate from 1,800
previously, currency strategist Marjorie Hernandez in  New York 
and economist Ramiro Blazquez in  Buenos Aires  wrote in a report.  The central bank may increase the amount of dollars it buys
in the  spot market  in the second half of 2012 to ease gains in
the local currency, Hernandez and Blazquez wrote. Colombia
probably won’t impose capital inflow restrictions, they wrote.  Banco de la Republica has said it will purchase a minimum
of $20 million daily in the foreign-exchange market until at
least Aug. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
