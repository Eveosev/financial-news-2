Japan  may announce preferential
price rates this month for electricity generated from renewable
energy in a program that will start in July to encourage
investment in non-fossil fuel power plants.  A five-person panel have been discussing the preferential
rates, known as feed-in tariffs, since March 6 and will hold
their sixth meeting on April 25.  Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry hopes to
receive the recommended rates by April 27, which will then need
government approval, Keisuke Murakami, who heads clean energy
programs at the ministry, said today.  The feed-in tariff guarantees above-market rates for solar,
wind, geothermal, biomass and hydroelectric power. The Japan
Photovoltaic Energy Association proposed 42 yen (52 cents) a
kilowatt-hour for 20 years for solar power. For wind, the Japan
Wind Power Association suggested as much as 25 yen a kilowatt-
hour for the same period.  Murakami said no decision had been made about rates for
solar power in response to a Nikkei newspaper  report  today that
said the rate will be 42 yen a kilowatt-hour for about 20 years.
