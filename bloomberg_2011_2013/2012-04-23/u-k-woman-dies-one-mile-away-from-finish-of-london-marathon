A 30-year-old woman who collapsed
and died less than a mile from the finish of yesterday’s  London 
marathon was identified as a hairdresser from the English
midlands, the  Daily Mail  said.  Claire Squires lived in North Kilworth in Leicestershire
and was attempting her second marathon, the newspaper said. She
collapsed on Birdcage Walk in central London, just short of the
finish line of the 26.2-mile run, and was given immediate
medical attention, organizers said.  Squires was the 10th participant to die during the race
since it started in 1981, with the last fatality coming in 2007.
More than 37,000 people took part in the event through central
London yesterday. She was raising funds for Samaritans, a U.K.
counseling service for people with depression. More than 5,100
people had donated on her  website , pledging more than 60,000
pounds ($97,000), most of which came after her death.  Wilson Kipsang won the men’s race on a day of Kenyan
domination. His compatriot Mary Keitany won the women’s event,
her second straight victory in the race.  Kipsang clocked a time of two hours, four minutes and 44
seconds, four seconds slower than the course record. The race
started in southeast London and ended at the Mall, near
 Buckingham Palace .  Three-time London champion Martin Lel of  Kenya  was second
in 2:06:51 as he overtook  Ethiopia ’s Tsegaye Kebede, the 2010
winner, in the final stages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
