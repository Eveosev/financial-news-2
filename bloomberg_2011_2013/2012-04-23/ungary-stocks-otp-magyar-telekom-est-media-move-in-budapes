Hungary ’s benchmark  BUX (BUX)  stock index
rose 1.3 percent to 17,352.61 by 10:58 a.m. in Budapest.  The following were among the most active shares in the
Hungarian market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Mol Nyrt. (MOL)  , Hungary’s largest refiner, rose 1.4
percent to 17,140 forint, rebounding from the lowest in three
months at yesterday’s close after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
raised its target price for the stock.  Est Media Vagyonkezelo Nyrt. (ESTMEDIA HB), a Hungarian
entertainment company, plunged for a fourth day. The stock slid
11 percent to 74 forint, a record low. An auction of the
company’s shares failed on April 20.  No bids were accepted at the auction on the Budapest Stock
Exchange on April 20, broker Equilor Befektetesi Zrt., which
conducted the sale, said in a statement sent by e-mail. The
company offered 2.7 million shares at the auction.  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP)  , Hungary’s largest lender, rose 1.9
percent to 3,433 forint, rebounding from the lowest close in
three months yesterday. OTP’s 2.9 percent drop yesterday pushed
the stock’s 14-day  relative strength index  to 30 yesterday. An
RSI of 30 or lower suggests to some technical analysts that a
stock is oversold. The RSI last traded at 36. European stocks
rebounded before reports on American consumer confidence and
home sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
