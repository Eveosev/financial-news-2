Asia  refining profits from gasoil
rose for the fifth time in six days. Naphtha and  fuel oil  swaps
declined, reducing producers’ margins from these fuels.  Middle Distillates  The premium of gasoil to Dubai crude, a benchmark price for
Asia, rose 37 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $16.93 a barrel at 2:28
p.m. Singapore time, according to data from PVM Oil Associates
Ltd., a broker. That would be the highest for the  crack spread 
since Feb. 17.  Singapore  gasoil  swaps for May rose 30 cents to $132.20 a
barrel. Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil rose to 50 cents from 45
cents on April 20. The  regrade  has doubled since the end of
March, signaling it is more profitable for refiners to make
 aviation fuel  over diesel.  Fuel Oil  High-sulfur fuel oil  swaps for May fell $2.25, or 0.3
percent, to $719.50 a metric ton, PVM data showed.  Singapore fuel oil’s  discount  to Dubai crude, a measure of
refining losses from the fuel, widened to $4.58 a barrel from
$4.30 on April 20.  The  premium  of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade was unchanged at $9.75 a ton and has narrowed from $10.50
a week earlier.  Light Distillates  Naphtha swaps for May fell $4, or 0.4 percent, to $1,007 a
ton.  Japan naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude
futures slid to $111.01 from $116.26 on April 20. The spread
fell 10 percent last week, the biggest decline since March 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
