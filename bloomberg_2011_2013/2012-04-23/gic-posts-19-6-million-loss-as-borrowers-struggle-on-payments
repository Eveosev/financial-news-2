MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG) , the mortgage
insurer that requested waivers from its regulator to keep
writing new policies, was unprofitable for a seventh straight
period as homeowners struggled to make their payments.  The first-quarter  net loss  narrowed to $19.6 million, or 10
cents a share, from $33.7 million, or 17 cents, a year earlier,
as results improved on investments, the Milwaukee-based company
said today in a statement.  Mortgage insurers have “stressed capital positions” after
defaults drained funds amid the deepest housing slump in seven
decades, Moody’s Investors Service said last month. Home prices
have fallen 34 percent since their peak in 2006 through January,
according to the S&P/Case-Shiller  index  of property values in 20
U.S. cities. Mortgage insurers pay lenders when homeowners
default and foreclosures fail to recoup costs.  “They’re still dealing with books that were written before
the crisis,” Bose George, an analyst at KBW Inc. in New York,
said by phone before results were announced. “ Home prices  were
30 plus percent higher and a lot of the buyers from the 2006 to
2007 books are significantly underwater.”  The inventory of delinquent loans fell to 160,473 from
175,639 on Dec. 31 and 195,885 at the end of last year’s first
quarter. MGIC slumped 6.8 percent to $3.43 at 4:05 p.m. in New
York.  Risk Ratio  The risk-to-capital ratio was unchanged at 20.3-to-1 on
March 31, the insurer said. Some states require mortgage
insurers to keep the ratio below 25 and the company reiterated
that it may miss that standard in the second half of this year.  Policy sales fell 7.1 percent to $255 million from $274.5
million a year earlier. MGIC’s cost of claims from mortgage
defaults rose to $337.1 million from $310.4 million.  The insurer spent $1.45 on claims and expenses at its
mortgage unit for every dollar it collected in premiums in the
quarter. The ratio is up from $1.24. Units of Old Republic Inc.
and PMI Group Inc. have stopped selling policies and been
ordered by regulators to pay only a portion of claims.  MGIC’s operating loss, which excludes some investment
results, was 48 cents a share, missing by 10 cents the average
estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Investment
gains jumped to $77.6 million, compared with $5.8 million a year
earlier. Book value per share, a measure of assets minus
liabilities, slipped to $5.60 from $5.95 as of Dec. 31.  MGIC  was  unprofitable for 18 of the last 19 quarters and
 plummeted  by half in the past 12 months through April 20 in  New
York . The insurer said last month that it cut Chief Executive
Officer Curt Culver’s bonus by more than 40 percent to $743,300
from $1.3 million for 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
