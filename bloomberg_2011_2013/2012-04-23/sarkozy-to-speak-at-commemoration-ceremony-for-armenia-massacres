French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
will speak at a ceremony tomorrow to commemorate the “Armenian
genocide”  last century, the presidential office said today in
an e-mailed statement.  In January, France’s Senate voted to approve legislation
making it a crime to deny that the mass killing of Armenians
early last century was genocide, infuriating Turkey and damaging
relations between the two countries. France’s constitutional
court subsequently ruled the legislation was invalid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
