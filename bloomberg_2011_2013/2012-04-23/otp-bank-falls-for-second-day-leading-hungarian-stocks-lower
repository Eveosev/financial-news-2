OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest
lender, fell to the lowest in three months as the government
said it plans to tax financial transactions and concern
increased the euro-area debt crisis will escalate.  OTP’s shares dropped 2.9 percent to 3,307 forint by the end
of trading in Budapest, the lowest level since Jan. 12. The
benchmark BUX stock  index  weakened 2.2 percent to 17,125.37.  Hungary will levy a 0.1 percent tax on bank transactions
from 2013, yielding between 130 billion forint ($570 million)
and 228 billion forint in revenue a year, the government said in
a document published on the  Economy Ministry ’s website today.
The tax will apply to private and corporate  bank transactions ,
including cash deposits and withdrawals, bank card transactions
as well as financial transactions carried out at post offices.  A contraction in euro-area manufacturing, French elections
and the Dutch prime minister’s offer to quit drove investors
from riskier emerging-market assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
