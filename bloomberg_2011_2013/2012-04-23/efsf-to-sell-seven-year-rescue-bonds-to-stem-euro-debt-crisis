The euro area’s bailout fund is
selling seven-year bonds in euros as part of efforts to contain
the region’s debt crisis.  The European Financial Stability Facility appointed HSBC
Holdings Plc, Morgan Stanley and Natixis SA as joint managers
for the issue, the Luxembourg-based issuer said in a statement.
The EFSF is planning to disburse 21 billion euros ($27.5
billion) this quarter in rescue programs for Ireland,  Portugal 
and  Greece .  Since its inception, the EFSF issued a total of 54.5
billion euros of bonds to help fund the sovereign bailouts and
Greece’s debt exchange. The 440 billion-euro fund has  committed
192 billion euros for rescue programs in Greece, Ireland and
Portugal.  Euro-area finance ministers capped fresh rescue lending at
500 billion euros last month after a German-led coalition
opposed further expansion of the anti-crisis firewall.  The EFSF is rated AA+ by  Standard & Poor’s , Aaa by Moody’s
and AAA by Fitch.  The EFSF’s 4 billion euros of 2 percent bonds due 2017
yield 37 basis points more than the benchmark swap rate,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The spread has
widened from a low of 24 basis points on March 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
