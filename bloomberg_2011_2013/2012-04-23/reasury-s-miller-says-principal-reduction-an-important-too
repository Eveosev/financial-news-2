Principal reduction is an
“important tool” in the effort to repair damage from the U.S.
housing crisis, a U.S. Treasury official said.  “In some targeted cases, principal reduction makes
economic sense for both the homeowner and the lender -- helping
reduce investor losses and preventable foreclosures over the
long term,”  Mary Miller , the Treasury’s undersecretary for
domestic finance, said in remarks prepared for a speech in
 Washington  today.  Miller said the housing market “remains weak, although it
has begun to show some signs of stabilization.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
