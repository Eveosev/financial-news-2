JBS SA (JBSS3) , the world’s largest beef
producer, made an offer to buy six plants owned by Independencia
SA, the Brazilian meatpacker under bankruptcy protection, for
268 million reais ($142 million).  JBS offered to pay about 133 million in cash and the rest
in stock, at 7.91 reais apiece, according to a regulatory filing
today. The bid doesn’t include the assumption of debt from
Independencia, the Sao Paulo-based company said.  The offer includes four slaughterhouses, two tanneries and
other assets owned by Independencia, which has been under
bankruptcy protection since 2009. The proposal will be submitted
to Independencia’s creditors including  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , which are slated to meet on April 30., JBS
said.  Independencia’s lawyer Renata Pimenta Bertolini didn’t
return calls from Bloomberg News seeking comment.  The Cajamar, Brazil-based meatpacker missed an interest
payment on its 2015 senior notes in September, 2010. It was due
to pay about $12 million on $165 million of its 15 percent
bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It reported debt
of 1.5 billion reais on June 30, 2010, the last data available.  JBS shares slumped 5.4 percent to 7.25 reais at 2:22 p.m.
in  Sao Paulo . Earlier the stock fell as much as 6.4 percent, the
most since March 22. The Bovespa stock index declined 1.8
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
