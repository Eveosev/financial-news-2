Kenya ’s shilling weakened for the
second trading session on increased interbank demand for dollars
as importers sought the U.S. currency to pay bills.  The currency of  East Africa ’s largest economy depreciated
as much as 0.2 percent and traded less than 0.1 percent lower at
83.20 per dollar by 12:49 p.m. in Nairobi, the capital.  “There is a build-up in interbank demand as the dollar
inflows from tea, horticulture, tourism are not as good as they
were last week,” Duncan Kinuthia, a currency dealer with
Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said by phone from Nairobi.
Dollar demand is “mostly coming from importers,” he said.  Kenya’s average interbank rate increased to 15.14 percent
during the week ending April 18, from 11.27 percent a week
earlier, while the average volume traded fell to 9.9 billion
shillings ($119 million) from 12.2 billion shillings, according
to the central bank in a  weekly bulletin .  The Ugandan currency strengthened as much as 0.7 percent
and was unchanged at 2,515 per dollar, while Tanzania’s shilling
declined for the first time in four trading days, slumping 0.2
percent to 1,588.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
