Rapeseed in  France ’s northeast is
flowering, and plants that haven’t been affected by freezing
weather are benefiting from cool and wet conditions, oilseed
researcher Cetiom reported.  The earliest crops have passed peak flowering, while late
rapeseed is starting to bloom, Paris-based Cetiom wrote in a
 report  on its website dated April 20.  “All the rapeseed crops in regions that were not or barely
affected by the frost should benefit from the current weather
conditions, cool temperatures and rain,” Cetiom wrote.  Rapeseed in Lorraine, Champagne and parts of Burgundy and
Franche-Comte regions  were “very affected” by freezing in
February and suffered additional frost damage at the start of
last week, while fungal infections are also causing losses,
according to the researcher.  To contact the reporter on this story:
