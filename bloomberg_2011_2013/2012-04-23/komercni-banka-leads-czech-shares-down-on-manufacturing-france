Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  fell to a three-
month low, leading Czech shares down, after manufacturing shrank
in the euro area and China and French President Nicolas Sarkozy
lost ground in elections, driving investors from riskier assets.  The Czech unit of Societe Generale SA slumped as much as
2.8 percent to the lowest intraday level since Jan. 19 and
traded down 2.1 percent to 3,350 koruna by 11:52 a.m. in Prague.
The 14-member  PX (PX)  equity gauge, where Komercni Banka has a 17
percent weighting, slipped 1.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
