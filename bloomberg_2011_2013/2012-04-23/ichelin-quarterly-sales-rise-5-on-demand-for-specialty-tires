Michelin & Cie. (ML) , the world’s
second-largest tiremaker, said first-quarter revenue rose 5.1
percent on higher demand for specialty tires to equip
earthmovers, aircraft and agricultural vehicles.  Sales advanced to 5.3 billion euros ($6.96 billion) from
5.1 billion euros a year earlier, Clermont-Ferrand, France-based
Michelin said in a statement today.  The company reiterated its forecast for stable 2012 sales
volume, saying that the market environment is “more uncertain
in Europe” and “resilient in  North America ,” and stuck with
its full-year profit target.  “Michelin reaffirms its 2012 objective of reporting a
clear increase in operating income and positive free cash
flow,” the company said in a statement emailed today.  The tiremaker, which ranks behind  Bridgestone Corp. (5108)  in
global production, said it projected full-year capital
expenditures of 1.9 billion euros. The annual additional costs
from rising raw material prices are estimated at 300 million
euros to 350 million euros, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
