Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  expects
the pace of sales growth in China to ease in the coming months,
 Ian Robertson , the company’s sales chief, told reporters at a
briefing in Beijing today.  The company continues to expect double-digit sales growth
in China this year, Robertson said. The environment in Europe
will be “challenging,” he said. BMW has seen some easing of
prices in China, Robertson said.  BMW is working on a China brand of electric cars, he said.
The company plans to open about 50 dealers in China during the
next 12 months, Robertson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
