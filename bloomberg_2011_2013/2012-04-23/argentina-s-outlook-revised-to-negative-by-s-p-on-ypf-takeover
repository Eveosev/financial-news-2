Argentina ’s credit rating outlook
was revised to negative from stable by  Standard & Poor’s , which
cited recent policies put in place since President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner’s re-election in October.  Measures including the nationalization of YPF SA, the
Argentine unit of Spanish oil company Repsol YPF SA, and
increasing international trade restrictions, “could increase
risks to Argentina’s macroeconomic framework, squeeze its
external liquidity and hinder medium-term growth prospects,”
S&P wrote.  Fernandez announced the takeover of YPF in a televised
national address on April 16, saying the company had failed to
boost investment and production. Repsol may sue any company that
invests in YPF after the seizure, spokesman Kristian Rix said
yesterday. Argentina’s Senate will vote tomorrow on Fernandez’s
proposal to take a 51 percent stake in YPF. Congress will
probably pass the measure quickly, S&P said.  The nationalization will “contribute to Argentina’s
deteriorating economic and political links with the
international community,” S&P wrote. “As a result, we do not
expect Argentina to progress on resolving its now long-standing
impediments to regaining access to international markets, or
curing the now 10-year-old default to the bilateral creditors of
the  Paris Club .”  S&P rates Argentina B, five levels below investment grade.
A negative outlook places the odds of a downgrade during the
coming year of at least a one-in-three.  To contact the reporter on this story:
