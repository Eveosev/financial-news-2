Iran’s grain imports are expected
to decline 5.8 percent in the year through March 2013 after
purchases in the beginning of this year boosted stockpiles, the
 United Nations ’  Food and Agriculture Organization  said.  Grain imports in 2012-13 may slip to 7.3 million metric
tons from 7.75 million tons in the previous year, the Rome-based
FAO wrote in a  report  on its website dated April 19. Wheat
imports may slump 32 percent, according to the UN agency.  Iran has completed its 2012 barley harvest, and farmers
will start to bring in the wheat crop in June, according to the
FAO. Wheat production is forecast to decline on below-average
rainfall from late November to mid January, it said.  “Despite the anticipated lower production in 2012, wheat
imports in the new marketing year are forecast at 1.7 million
tons, some 32 percent below the previous year mainly due to
higher carryover stocks from the current season due to large
purchases in early months of 2012,” the FAO wrote.  Total grain imports are expected to remain high on imports
of corn and rice, according to the agency.  Iran ’s 2012 barley crop is estimated to be little changed
at 3 million tons, while paddy rice production is estimated to
be stable at 2.4 million tons, the report showed. The wheat
harvest may slip 3.6 percent to 13.5 million tons.  “Wheat is the dominant cereal in the country,” the FAO
wrote. “Irrigated wheat covers only one-third of the total
wheat area, thus the majority of wheat crops depends on the
performance of the rains.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
