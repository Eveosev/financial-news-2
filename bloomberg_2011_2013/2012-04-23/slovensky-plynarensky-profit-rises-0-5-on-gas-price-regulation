Slovensky Plynarensky Priemysel AS,
Slovakiaâ€™s dominant natural-gas company, said net income rose
0.5 percent last year as price regulation affected
profitability.  Consolidated net income rose to 564 million euros ($741
million) from 561 million euros a year earlier, the Bratislava,
Slovakia-based  company , also known as SPP, said on its website
today. Revenue increased to 3.16 billion euros from 3.02 billion
euros in 2010.  Slovensky Plynarensky reported a 50 million-euro loss on
sales to local households, where the government has put a cap on
prices. Total domestic sales declined 4.9 percent to 2.13
billion euros.  GDF Suez (GSZ)  and E.ON Ruhrgas AG own 49 percent of SPP, with
Slovakia holding the rest. SPP makes most of its revenue from
operating a section of the pipeline transporting Russian gas to
western  Europe .  To contact the reporter on this story:
