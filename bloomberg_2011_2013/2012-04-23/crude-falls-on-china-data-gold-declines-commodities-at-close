The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities gained 0.7 percent to 679.79 at 8:10 p.m.
Singapore time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
rose 0.7 percent to 1,573.675.  CRUDE OIL  Oil traded near the highest level in a week in  New York  after
the  American Petroleum Institute  said crude inventories fell in
the U.S., the world’s biggest consumer of the commodity.  Crude for June delivery advanced as much as 65 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $104.20 a barrel in electronic trading on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange . The contract was at $104.10 at
12:35 p.m.  London  time. U.S. crude rose 44 cents to $103.55
yesterday, the highest close since April 17. Prices are up 5.4
percent this year.  NATURAL GAS  OIL PRODUCTS  The premium of gasoil , or diesel, to Asian benchmark Dubai
crude fell 21 cents to $16.78 a barrel at 6:22 p.m. Singapore
time, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd. , a broker.
This crack spread, a gauge of processing profit, narrowed for
the second time in eight days.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil dropped 5 cents to 35 cents a
barrel, PVM said. This regrade is the lowest in more than a
week, indicating a decline in the profitability of making
 aviation fuel  over diesel.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold for June delivery was little changed at $1,643.90 an
ounce by 8:06 a.m. on the Comex in New York. Bullion for
immediate delivery was little changed at $1,643.25 in London.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
