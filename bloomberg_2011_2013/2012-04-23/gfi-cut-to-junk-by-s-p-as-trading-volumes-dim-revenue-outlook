GFI Group Inc. (GFIG)  had its credit
ratings cut to below investment grade by  Standard & Poor’s  as
the broker of transactions between banks faces lower trading
volumes.  S&P cut the New York-based company’s issuer credit and
senior unsecured grades one level to BB+ with a negative outlook
on the company, the ratings firm said in a statement today. S&P
said GFI will struggle to improve credit measures amid
“competitive and slow trading conditions” that are pressuring
revenue from arranging transactions electronically or over the
phone.  The ratings “reflect the company’s position as a small
firm in the intensely competitive, low-margin, and relatively
narrow institutional agency brokerage business,” S&P said in
the statement.  GFI is scheduled to report its first-quarter earnings on
April 26 after markets close.  Shares of GFI, which have dropped 21 percent this year, 
rose  1.9 percent to $3.24 today in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
