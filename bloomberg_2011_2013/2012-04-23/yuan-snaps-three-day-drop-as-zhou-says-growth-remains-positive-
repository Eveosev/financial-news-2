The yuan rose, halting a three-day
decline, after People’s Bank of  China  Governor Zhou Xiaochuan
said the country’s growth prospects “remain positive.”  Zhou made the comments in a statement in  Washington , where
he was attending the spring meetings of the  International
Monetary Fund  that ended yesterday. A wider yuan trading band
means investors can play a bigger role in determining the value
of the currency, which has been a “persistent two-way bet” for
some time, PBOC Deputy Governor Yi Gang said in Washington. The
central bank raised the daily  reference rate  by 0.11 percent,
the most since April 13, to 6.2970 per dollar today.  “The stronger fixing seems to reflect the central bankers’
remarks,” said Patrick Cheng, a Hong Kong-based foreign-
exchange analyst at Haitong International Securities Co. “The
yuan will appreciate but at a slower pace this year as investors
are still cautious on global growth. There’ll be more two-way
fluctuations.”  The yuan advanced 0.03 percent to 6.3064 per dollar as of
10:20 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System.  The currency is allowed to trade 1 percent on
either side of the fixing.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan rose 0.02 percent
to 6.3045. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards gained 0.03
percent to 6.3385, a 0.5 percent discount to the onshore spot
rate. One-month implied volatility for the currency, a measure
of exchange-rate swings used to price options, was unchanged at
2.1 percent.  China’s economy  expanded 8.1 percent in the first quarter,
above the 7.5 percent annual growth target that Premier Wen
Jiabao set in March. The IMF said last week the economy will
grow 8.2 percent this year, more than a previous forecast of 8.1
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
