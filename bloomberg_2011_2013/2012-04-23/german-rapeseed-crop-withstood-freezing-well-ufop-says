Germany ’s rapeseed crop on a whole
withstood a freezing spell in late January and early February
“well,” unlike plants in parts of France and Poland, the
German oilseed-industry association said.  Some farmers in Germany were forced to plow under their
rapeseed and replant fields, the Union zur Forderung von Oel-und
Proteinpflanzen e.V., or UFOP, wrote in a  statement  on its
website today. The rapeseed harvest is expected in August, the
group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
