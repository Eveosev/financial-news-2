Swedish Finance Minister Anders Borg said he sees “very dark clouds” over the Spanish banking
system.  Borg, in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Bottom
Line” with Mark Crumpton, said today that  Europe  basically has
 price stability  and the “fiscal side has improved.”  “On the banking side, where there are some very dark
clouds hanging, particularly over the Spanish banking system, I
think there is a necessity for liquidity support, but also to do
recapitalization eventually,” Borg said.  Europe needs to do more on the fiscal side and for growth,
Borg said.  “There are too much regulations in Italy, Spain and many
other European countries,” Borg said. “Our labor market is
lacking in flexibility.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
