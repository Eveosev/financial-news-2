Gulf Coast gasoline fell after
Motiva Enterprises LLC started a new delayed coker at its
refinery in  Port Arthur , Texas.  The new coker, which will support production of distillate
fuels and gasoline, began running April 15, a person with
knowledge of the refineryâ€™s operation said. The person said the
refinery has since shut a sulfur recovery unit and its original
coker for several weeks of planned maintenance.  The refinery is expanding to become the largest in the
nation, with the capacity to process 600,000 barrels a day.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast widened 0.75 cent to 16.25 cents a gallon below
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:40
p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The same fuel in New York fell 0.25 cent to a discount of
6.63 cents.  Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  said today that it may sell a majority stake in
its 330,000-barrel-a-day Philadelphia refinery to  Carlyle Group (CG) 
and keep the plant running. Sunoco said it delayed plans to idle
the facility while the discussions continue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
