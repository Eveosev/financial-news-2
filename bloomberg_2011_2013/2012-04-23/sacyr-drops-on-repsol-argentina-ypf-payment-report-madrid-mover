Sacyr Vallehermoso SA (SYV) , the Spanish
builder that owns 10 percent of oil company  Repsol YPF SA (REP) , fell
to the lowest in almost 20 years after an Argentinian newspaper
reported the government may not pay for a nationalization move.  Sacyr dropped as much as 11 percent to 1.42 euros, the
lowest intraday price since September 1992, and traded down 9.9
percent at 1:57 p.m. in Madrid, valuing the construction company
at 608.5 million euros ($800 million). The stock was the worst
performer on the benchmark IBEX 35 Index.  Repsol declined as much as 4.5 percent after La Nacion
 reported  today that Argentina’s government aims to pay nothing
for the 51 percent of YPF SA that it seized from Madrid-based
Repsol,  Spain ’s biggest oil company. Argentinian President
 Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  announced the nationalization on
April 16, wiping 3.8 billion euros off Repsol’s market value.  “Sacyr moves along with Repsol, as it’s the asset that
could make a difference either for good or bad,” Juan Carlos Calvo, a Madrid-based analyst at Banco Espirito Santo, said
today by phone. “This is a convulsive time for Repsol, with big
uncertainty on how the whole deal over YPF is going to wrap up,
whether or not Repsol will cut the dividend or raise capital, or
if it’s going to get paid by Argentina.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
