The cost of insuring Australian
corporate bonds from non-payment decreased, according to traders
of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index fell 1 basis point to 158
as of 10:33 a.m. in Sydney,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  prices show. The
measure has traded between 128.2 and 182.8 this year, according
to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  was unchanged at 167.5 basis points as
of 8:33 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Credit Agricole prices show. The
index rose 1.5 basis points to 166.8 last week, CMA prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was unchanged at 173 basis
points as of 9:34 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG prices show.
The index rose 3.3 basis points to 171.9 last week, according to
CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
