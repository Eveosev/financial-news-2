Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. (1171) , China’s
fourth-largest producer, recorded an 11 percent drop in first-
quarter profit as prices fell and operating costs increased.  Net income declined to 2.2 billion yuan ($349 million), or
0.4457 a share, from 2.48 billion yuan, or 0.5034 yuan, a year
earlier, the Shandong-based company said today in a statement.
Sales gained 54 percent to 14.4 billion yuan.  Chinese coal prices in the first quarter fell from a year
earlier as inventories climbed on slowing demand and the
government announced a price cap. Salable coal production rose
30 percent to 14.7 million metric tons in the quarter, while
cost of coal sales rose, Yanzhou Coal said.  The average price of the company’s coal products fell 10
percent to 654.1 yuan a ton in the first quarter from a year
earlier, Yanzhou Coal said. Spot prices at northern Chinese
ports were capped by the National Development and Reform
Commission at 800 yuan a ton since the start of the year.  The benchmark price of thermal coal with an energy value of
5,500 kilocalories a kilogram at  Qinhuangdao port  rebounded to a
13-week high of 780 yuan to 790 yuan a ton as of yesterday,
according to data today from the  China  Coal Transport and
Distribution Association. That’s down 2.2 percent from a year
earlier.  The cost of coal sales more than doubled to 9.03 billion
yuan in the first quarter after the company sold more of the
commodity from external purchases than from its own mines,
according to the statement.  Yanzhou, which acquired Felix Resources Ltd. for A$3.1
billion ($3.2 billion) in 2009, received approval last month
from the Australian government for its A$2.05 billion takeover
of  Gloucester Coal Ltd. (GCL)  The company is seeking assets in  Canada ,
Indonesia and Mongolia to boost overseas output.  The  shares  fell 1.7 percent to close at HK$16.50 in  Hong
Kong , before the earnings announcement. The benchmark  Hang Seng
Index  dropped 1.8 percent. Yanzhou’s stock in  Shanghai  gained
0.7 percent to 23.71 yuan.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
