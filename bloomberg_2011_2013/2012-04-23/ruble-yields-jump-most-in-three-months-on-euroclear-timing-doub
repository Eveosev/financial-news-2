Ruble bonds plunged, lifting yields
the most in almost three months, on concern plans to allow
trading by foreign investors may get delayed.  Russia ’s 119 billion rubles ($4 billion) of domestic OFZ
bonds due 2021 fell for the first day in three, lifting the
yield nine basis points to 8 percent at the close in Moscow.
That’s the biggest daily increase since Jan. 24.  The majority on President  Dmitry Medvedev ’s working group
voted against allowing Euroclear Bank SA and Clearstream
International SA direct access to the Russian market on April
20, Interfax reported today, citing three unidentified
participants. Russia’s financial regulator is considering the
doubts raised by market participants, Ruben Aganbegyan,
president of the Micex-RTS exchange, said in an interview with
Bloomberg in  London  today.  “It now looks uncertain whether Euroclear will be able to
open direct accounts with the central depositary this year,”
Dmitry Dudkin, head of fixed-income research at UralSib
Financial Corp. in Moscow, said by e-mail. “Some investors
bought OFZs in light of this liberalization in January, so they
may be disappointed. We could see less foreign participation in
the primary auctions going forward.”  The government had planned to allow OFZs to settle through
Euroclear from July 1, Konstantin Vyshkovsky, head of the
 Finance Ministry ’s debt department, said in February.  Ruble  Euroclear has received no official comment from the
government since the meeting on April 20, Philippe Laurensy,
head of sales for central and northern  Europe , said by phone
from Brussels today.  The ruble slid 0.4 percent to 29.57 per dollar and gained
0.2 percent to 38.8124 per euro, leaving it steady at 33.7291
against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket. Investors
increased bets on the currency weakening, with non-deliverable
forwards showing the ruble at 29.9447 per dollar in three
months, compared with expectations of 29.8105 per dollar on
April 20.  Government ruble debt due August 2016 yielded three basis
points more than on April 20, at 7.4 percent.  China Manufacturing  Brent crude  slipped 1 percent to $117.59 per barrel, the
first decline since April 18. Chinese customs data showed the
country’s apparent oil demand dropped to the lowest level since
October, and a separate report indicated its manufacturing may
shrink for a sixth month.  Russia’s dollar-denominated bonds due April 2015 fell,
increasing the yield one basis point to 2.169 percent. Similar-
maturity Eurobonds from OAO Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender,
yielded one basis point more than on April 20 at 3.658 percent,
while the yield on 2015 dollar debt issued by state gas monopoly
OAO fell five basis points to 3.408 percent.  The cost of insuring Russian Eurobonds against nonpayment
over five years with credit default swaps climbed six basis
points to 206, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That
compares with 206 basis points for contracts on the French
government’s debt, rated eight levels higher than Russia at AAA
by  Fitch Ratings .  To contact the reporter on this story:
