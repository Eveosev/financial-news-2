Repsol YPF SA (REP)  may sue any company
that invests in  YPF SA (YPFD)  after it was seized by the Argentine
government last week, company spokesman Kristian Rix said.  The Argentine government needs to raise financing for YPF
so that it can pay to develop oil fields such as the shale
deposits in Vaca Muerta and boost the country’s fuel supplies.  “Repsol reserves the right to take legal action against
any investor in YPF,” Rix said in a telephone interview today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
