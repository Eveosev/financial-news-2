Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) ,  India ’s biggest
wind turbine maker, lost its second senior manager in less than
a month after the chief financial officer of its German unit
Repower SE resigned.  Derrick Noe resigned from Repower’s executive board of
directors on April 19 “due to different views on the company’s
future business strategy,” the company said in a  website
statement  dated yesterday.  Suzlon, struggling to meet debt repayments, is studying
options for Hamburg-based Repower including a sale or a stake
listing, Bloomberg reported April 6, citing people with
knowledge of the matter. Suzlon lost its chief financial officer
last month when  Robin Banerjee  quit. Kirti Vagadia, the head of
corporate finance, has assumed his responsibilities.  Wind turbine makers face narrowing margins after reducing
prices to compete for orders as U.S. and European governments
cut clean-energy incentives to curb budget deficits. Losses at
Suzlon grew to 2.86 billion rupees ($54 million) in the three
months through December, the most in five quarters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
