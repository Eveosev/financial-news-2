General Electric Co. (GE) , the biggest
maker of power-generation equipment, will join with  Arista Power
Inc. (ASPW)  to sell systems that store electricity for commercial
customers and release it when demand is highest, helping to cut
bills.  The system, which will use GE’s Durathon batteries, can
store power from on-site wind or solar sources or from the grid
and deliver it during peak periods, when commercial customers
are subject to “demand charges,” according to a statement
today.  The charges  can account for as much as 70 percent of an
electric bill for commercial customers, which include shopping
centers and office buildings.  It gives business owners control over their power “much
more effectively and efficiently,” William Schmitz, chief
executive officer of Rochester, New York-based Arista, said in a
phone interview today. GE and Arista will promote and market the
system.  Customers can see returns from the systems in two to five
years typically, cutting costs by 15 to 25 percent, said  Mark
Matthews , Arista’s vice president of sales and marketing. Arista
is focused on areas like the Northeast and Southern California
where grids are strained, he said.  Arista rose 7 percent to $3.21 at 12:34 p.m. in  New York .
The shares have gained 79 percent this year. GE, based in
Fairfield,  Connecticut , fell 1.9 percent to $18.99.  GE’s Durathon  nickel-salt battery  can last as long as 20
years, operate in extreme temperatures and is marketed for
telecommunications, utilities and uninterruptible power supply
applications, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
