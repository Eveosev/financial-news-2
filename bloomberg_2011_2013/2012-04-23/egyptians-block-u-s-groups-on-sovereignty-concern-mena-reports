Egypt  has refused to authorize
permits for eight U.S. non-governmental organizations, including
the  Carter Center , saying their work runs counter to the
country’s sovereign interests, the state-run Middle East News
Agency reported.  The organizations carry out their missions in a manner that
“contradicts Egypt’s sovereignty,” the Cairo-based agency
reported, quoting an unidentified official in the country’s
Ministry of Social Affairs. The official said that while Egypt
didn’t object to the groups’ stated goals, it disliked the way
these were implemented.  The decision follows a dispute with the U.S. following
Egypt’s decision to bar several American NGO workers, including
the son of U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, from
leaving the country. The Americans were part of a group of 43
people working for five different groups whose offices were
raided and a criminal case launched on the grounds that they
were operating illegally in the country. Two have links to the
two main U.S. political parties.  The U.S. and other foreign nationals were eventually
allowed to leave the country after paying what amounted to bail
of about $5 million. The dispute prompted a backlash in the
U.S., and raised doubts at the time about whether Egypt would be
given more than $1 billion in annual military aid.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
