Q-Cells SE (QCE)  rose the most in six
weeks in  Frankfurt  after an administrator said several parties
had shown interest in the German solar-cell and module maker
that filed for insolvency this month.  Q-Cells climbed 21 percent to 16 euro cents at the close,
the steepest gain since March 12, after preliminary insolvency
administrator Henning Schorisch said  “interested parties”
including financial and strategic investors in  Germany  and other
countries contacted him after the April 3 insolvency filing.  “Our aim is to save as much of Q-Cells as possible,”
Schorisch said today in a statement. “The next few weeks will
show the extent of investors’ interest.”  German solar companies have struggled with reduced
 government aid  and competition from Chinese companies that
created a glut of solar panels. Q-Cells, once the biggest solar-
cell maker,  Solon SE (SOO1) ,  Solar Millennium AG (S2M)  and  Solarhybrid AG (SHL)  all
filed for insolvency since December.  Schorisch hired Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd.’s Frankfurt
office to search for investors amid a plan to sell Q-Cells to
one or several buyers, according to the statement. The company
based in Thalheim, Germany, has resumed production of cells and
modules, according to the statement.  The company has lost 70 percent of its value this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
