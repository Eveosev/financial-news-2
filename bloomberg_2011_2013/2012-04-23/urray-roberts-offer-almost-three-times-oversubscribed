Murray & Roberts Holdings Ltd. (MUR) ,
 South Africa ’s second-biggest construction company, said its
rights offer announced in February was almost three times
oversubscribed.  Investors sought 110.5 million rights-offer shares,
equivalent to 97.9 percent of the 112.8 million offered,
Johannesburg-based Murray & Roberts said in a statement today.
Holders of rights willing to buy more stock applied for a
further 207 million shares, equivalent to 183.5 percent of the
total offered. The subscription price was 18 rand a share.  “The net proceeds from the rights offer will be deployed
to reduce the group’s debt,” Chief Executive Officer Henry Laas
said in a statement. The strengthening of Murray & Roberts
finances “will provide additional support to our recovery and
growth plan.”  Murray & Roberts posted a loss of 528 million rand ($67
million) in the six months through December. Last year it
resolved not to pay dividends until liquidity improves following
a slowdown in South African spending on infrastructure and
unresolved claims with projects in its home market and Dubai.
Murray & Roberts, which helped build the Gautrain rapid-rail
network that links Johannesburg and  Pretoria , also has
operations in  Australia .  Murray & Roberts fell 3.8 percent to 27.29 rand at the
close in Johannesburg, the biggest drop since Jan. 31. The stock
has climbed 18 percent this year, compared with a 19 percent
gain in the  FTSE/JSE Africa Construction & Building Materials (JCBDM) 
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
