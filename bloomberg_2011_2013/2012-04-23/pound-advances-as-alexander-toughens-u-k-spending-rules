U.K. 10-year gilts rose for the
first time in five days as investors sought the safety of
British debt on concern political turmoil in the Netherlands and
French elections may disrupt efforts to stem the debt crisis.  The pound climbed to the strongest level in 20 months
against the euro after Socialist challenger  Francois Hollande 
progressed to the final round of the French presidential
election ahead of incumbent  Nicolas Sarkozy . The Netherlands
faces early elections after one of the parties in the minority
ruling coalition withdrew. Sterling rose against most of its 16
major peers.  “It will remain the European story that drives gilts,”
said  Elisabeth Afseth , an analyst at Investec Bank Plc in
London. “You’ve got all the usual spreads quite a lot wider,
including  France  after the election, and things in the
Netherlands are being stirred up as well. It’s the benefit of
not being part of it” that is supporting gilts, she said.  U.K. 10-year bond yields fell five basis points to 2.12
percent at 4:25 p.m.  London  time. The yield slid as much as
eight basis points, the biggest intraday drop since April 10.
The 4 percent security due March 2022 rose 0.505, or 5.05 pounds
per 1,000-pound ($1,610) face amount, to 116.630.  German 10-year bunds rose, pushing the yield on the
securities to a euro-era record low 1.633 percent today.
Similar-maturity Dutch bonds slid, pushing the yield difference,
or spread, between the two to a three-year high.  European Elections  Dutch Prime Minister  Mark Rutte  offered to quit, a move
that would trigger elections, as he sought to win parliamentary
support for additional budget cuts after the minority government
lost the support of the  Freedom Party .  In France, Hollande took 28.6 percent of the vote against
27.1 percent for Sarkozy, the  Interior Ministry  said. The second
round of voting takes place on May 6.  The pound appreciated 0.5 percent to 81.57 pence per euro
and reached 81.49 pence, the strongest level since August 2010.
Sterling was 0.2 percent weaker at $1.6097. It touched $1.6149
on April 20, the most since Oct. 31.  U.K. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said
today that government departments must hold 5 percent of their
non-capital budgets in reserve to allow them to meet unforeseen
spending needs, according to the text of a speech published on
the Treasury’s  website  today. He’s aiming to prevent slippage in
the country’s fiscal plans.  Gilt Yields  Gilt yields “might be in a bit of a 2 percent to 2.25
percent corridor for the time being,” said Afseth. “As far as
austerity and doing the right thing, the U.K. is in the good
books of investors and rating agencies, largely.”  The weighted average of 13 estimates in a Bloomberg survey
calls for the yield to climb to 2.38 percent by the end of June.  The yield on 10-year gilts rose  last week  for the first
time since the five days ended March 16 as investors bet the
 Bank of England  will pause its stimulus plan after stronger-
than-forecast inflation and retail sales data.  A report in two days will show Britain’s  gross domestic
product  expanded 0.1 percent in the first quarter after a 0.3
percent contraction in the previous three months, according to
the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Sterling has climbed 1.8 percent in the past month, the
second-best performer after the yen among the 10 developed-
nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes. The euro dropped 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
