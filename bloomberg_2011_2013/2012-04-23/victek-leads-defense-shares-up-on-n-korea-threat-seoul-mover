Victek Co. (065450)  led South Korean
defense-related shares higher after North Korea’s military said
it will soon take “special action” against South Korean
President Lee Myung Bak’s government.  Victek, a maker of electronic warfare equipment, gained by
the daily limit of 15 percent to close at 3,045 won.  Speco Co. (013810) 
jumped 13 percent to 3,205 won.  Huneed Technologies (005870) , a military
communications equipment maker, rose 5.9 percent to 3,950 won.
The benchmark  Kospi (KOSPI)  index fell 0.1 percent.  A North Korean special action squad will turn Lee and his
government into ashes within three to four minutes using
“unprecedented peculiar means and methods of our own style,”
the military said today in a statement carried by the official
Korean Central News Agency, without giving further details.  While the totalitarian country often issues threats of war,
the North has boosted its rhetoric against Lee this month while
marking the centennial of state founder  Kim Il Sung . A rocket
launched on April 13 as a centerpiece of the celebrations
disintegrated after liftoff, prompting speculation the regime
would detonate a nuclear weapon to regain face.  South Korea’s military didn’t raise its alert levels as no
special North Korean troop movements were sighted today, said a
Defense Ministry official who declined to be named, citing
military policy. Lee’s office didn’t have any comment,
spokeswoman Lee Mi Yon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
