The French soft-wheat crop rated
“excellent” increased in the latest week, while the conditions
of durum wheat and barley also improved, crop office
FranceAgriMer reported.  Twelve percent of  France ’s soft wheat was rated
“excellent” in the week ended April 16, up from 11 percent a
week earlier, while 50 percent was rated “good,” compared with
51 percent the previous week, FranceAgriMer  reported  on its
website. The crop rated “fair” was unchanged at 26 percent.  The ratings are the average for eight regions that
represent 54 percent of French soft-wheat production, according
to the Montreuil-sous-Bois, France-based office.  Durum wheat was 41 percent rated “good” and 4 percent
“excellent,” compared with 39 percent and 3 percent the
previous week, based on three regions making up 58 percent of
French production of the grain.  The amount of winter barley rated “good” advanced 1
percentage point to 47 percent, while “excellent” was stable
at 9 percent, based on conditions in seven regions that
represent 56 percent of average national output.  For spring barley, the “good” rating remained in place
for 62 percent of the crop, while grain rated “excellent”
climbed to 15 percent from 14 percent, based on data from five
