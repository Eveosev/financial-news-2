YPF SA (YPFD) , Argentinaâ€™s largest energy
company, and  ConocoPhillips (COP)  officials met today to discuss
possible investments to develop shale-oil deposits in the South
American country, YPF said in an e-mailed statement.  Planning Minister Julio De Vido, who was put in charge of
YPF after the government seized control of the company last
week, met with David Jones, head of upstream business
development in Latin America at ConocoPhillips, according to the
