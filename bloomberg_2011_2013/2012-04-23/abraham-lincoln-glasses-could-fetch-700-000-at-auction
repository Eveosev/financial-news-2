The opera glasses held by  Abraham Lincoln  when he was assassinated 147 years ago are coming to the
auction block next week.  Los Angeles-based auctioneer  Nate D. Sanders  estimated that
they might fetch $500,000 to $700,000.  Lincoln was fatally shot at Ford’s Theatre in  Washington  on
April 14, 1865, while attending “Our American Cousin,” a play
starring Laura Keene. During the comedy, actor and Confederate
sympathizer John Wilkes Booth entered Lincoln’s box and shot him
in the head.  The president’s black enameled and gold glasses were picked
up on the street by Captain James M. McCamly, a Washington City
Guard who was helping transport Lincoln from the theater to the
Petersen House, where the president died hours later.  “You can imagine all the commotion,” said Laura Yntema,
auction manager at Sanders. “They probably just fell down as he
was being moved across the street to the hospital. They are very
well documented. We have James McCamly’s military records and a
notarized letter from the McCamly’s family as well.”  Made by German company Gebruder Strausshof Optiker Berlin,
the glasses remained in McCamly’s family for three generations.  Magazine publisher Malcolm Forbes Sr. bought them in 1979.
The current owner is anonymous. The glasses last came up for
sale at  Sotheby’s (BID)  in June 2011, with the estimate of $500,000 to
$700,000. There were no takers.  Bids can be placed online or by phone at +1-310-440-2982
through April 30 at 5 p.m. PDT. The current bid is  $19,263 ,
according to the auction house website.  To contact the reporter of this story:
