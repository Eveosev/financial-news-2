Denmark Trade Minister Pia Olsen Dyhr said today she expects the European Union and  Canada  will
conclude a free trade agreement within six months.  “We are actually at the end game,” Dyhr told reporters
after meeting Canadian Trade Minister Ed Fast in Ottawa. Denmark
holds the presidency of the Council of the European Union.  She acknowledged that Canada’s quota system on dairy and
poultry products, known as supply-management, as well as how
rules of origin are determined, remain issues for the EU.  Fast said he is “quite satisfied” with the progress by
the two sides.  “We are hoping for the most comprehensive and ambitious
trade agreement that Canada has ever signed,” said Fast. The
government “will not sign an agreement unless it’s in the best
interests of Canadians,” he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
