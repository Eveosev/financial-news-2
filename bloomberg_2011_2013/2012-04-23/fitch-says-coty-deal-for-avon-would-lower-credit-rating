An acquisition of  Avon Products
Inc. (AVP)  by Coty Inc. would be “credit negative,” according to
analysts at  Fitch Ratings .  “We expect it might be challenging for Coty to maintain
investment-grade ratings after an acquisition, even at the
initial offer price of $23.25 per share,” Kellie Geressy-Nilsen
and Grace Barnett, Fitch analysts, wrote in a report today.  “While Avon’s current $400 million dividend could be
diverted to debt service, the consolidated entity’s credit
measures and financial flexibility would be materially lower.”  Avon rejected Coty’s $10 billion offer on April 2, saying
it undervalued the company. Coty, the New York-based maker of
perfumes by Heidi Klum and  Beyonce Knowles , is working to build
support among Avon shareholders for the offer. Last week, Coty
said it’s confident in its financing for a deal. Buying Avon,
the world’s largest door-to-door cosmetics seller, would give
Coty access to emerging markets such as  Brazil .  Avon’s quick dismissal of the offer, along with Coty’s
statement it would not undertake a hostile bid, “lessen the
prospects of a takeover,” the analysts wrote. Fitch  rates 
Avon’s long-term debt BBB, the second-lowest level of investment
grade debt, and has a negative outlook on the company.  Avon fell 1.4 percent to $21.69 at the close in  New York .
The shares have gained 24 percent this year.  Closely held Coty is owned by Joh A. Benckiser SE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
