Chinese solar stocks, led by  LDK
Solar Co. (LDK) , tumbled in New York as data signaled Chinese
manufacturing is shrinking and U.S. panel maker  First Solar Inc. (FSLR) 
was cut to sell by Maxim Group LLC.  LDK, the world’s second-largest maker of solar wafers,
slipped 8.6 percent to $2.97 in New York, the lowest level since
Nov. 21.  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL) , China’s third-biggest maker of solar
panels, declined 5.8 percent to $6.38, while  Suntech Power
Holdings Co. (STP) , the world’s largest manufacturer of panels, fell
4.6 percent to $2.49, the least since Jan. 9.  China’s purchasing managers’ index shrank to a preliminary
reading of 49.1 in April, signaling manufacturing may have
contracted for a six month, according to HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics. A number below 50 points to a contraction.
Tempe, Arizona-based First Solar, the world’s largest thin-film
panel maker, was cut from hold by Maxim because of an excess
supply of polysilicon in the industry, according to a report.  “Investors and analysts are trying to determine who are
going to be the survivors in the industry in the long term,”
said  Michael Obuchowski , chief investment officer at First
Empire Asset Management, which has $4.5 billion under
management.  “The manufacturing numbers out of China are apparently
panicking people and downgrades don’t help either,” Obuchowski,
who sold shares in First Solar last year and continues to
monitor the industry, said in a phone interview from Hauppauge,
New York.  First Solar tumbled 6.8 percent in New York to $19.25, a
record low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
