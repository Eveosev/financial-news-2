Hong Kong  stocks  fell, with the
city’s benchmark index falling the most in almost seven weeks,
after  China Mobile (941)  Ltd. missed profit estimates and a report
signaled mainland manufacturing may shrink for a sixth month.  China Mobile slid 3 percent after higher costs to attract
customers ate into earnings at the world’s biggest phone company
by users. China National Materials Co. slumped 4.4 percent after
the manufacturer of cement-making equipment said it may post a
first-quarter loss. Mainland refiner  China Petroleum & Chemical
Corp. (600028)  slid 1.9 percent after China National Radio reported the
government may cut fuel prices next month as the slowing economy
reduces demand.  The Hang Seng Index slid 1.8 percent to 20,624.39 at the
close, its steepest drop since March 6. All but three stocks
declined in the 48-member gauge. Volume on was 22 percent below
the 30-day intraday average. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies fell 2.2 percent to 10,810.48.  “With a lot of companies issuing profit warnings, it’s
making investors cautious,” said Francis Lun, managing director
at Hong Kong-based Lyncean Holdings Ltd. “ China’s economy  is
slowing, and that has a direct impact on corporate earnings.”  The Hang Seng Index has fallen about 4.9 percent from this
year’s peak on Feb. 29 as China targeted the slowest economic
growth since 2005 and amid speculation the gauge had risen too
fast after an 18 percent advance in the first two months of the
year. Companies on the index trade at an average of 10.4 times
 estimated earnings , up from 10 times on Dec. 30 according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
trades at 13.1 times.  Shrinking Manufacturing  Futures on the  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  retreated 2 percent to
20,568. The HSI Volatility Index rose 6.7 percent to 20.50,
indicating options traders expect a swing of 5.9 percent in the
benchmark over the next 30 days.  Stocks fell today after a report from HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit showed China’s manufacturing may contract for a sixth
month in April. The  Purchasing Managers ’ Index rose to 49.1 from
48.3 in March and was below the 50 threshold that signals growth.  China Mobile dropped 3 percent to HK$84.80, the  second-
biggest drag  on the Hang Seng Index, after posting first-quarter
profit of 27.8 billion yuan ($4.4 billion), missing the 28.2
billion yuan median estimate of four analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Margins fell as the carrier increased spending
to draw new customers amid tighter competition, it said.  Profit Warning  China  National Materials declined 4.4 percent to HK$3.06
after saying it may swing to a loss in the three months through
March on falling prices and sales. The company issued the profit
warning after the close of markets on April 20.  Changan Minsheng APLL Logistics Co., a supply-chain
management company, slid 10 percent to HK$5.73, a six-month low.
Profit probably fell in the first quarter as production and
sales declined among customers in the  auto industry , it said in
a statement that didn’t provide figures.  Ten of the 19 companies listed in Hong Kong that reported
quarterly earnings so far this month posted lower profits than
last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China Petroleum & Chemical slumped 1.9 percent to HK$8.14,
while PetroChina Co., a Beijing-based refiner, declined 1.8
percent to HK$11.20. China may cut gasoline and diesel prices
next month, China National Radio reported yesterday, citing
Zhang Bin, an analyst at researcher Chem99.com.  Dongyue Group (189) , a chemicals maker, slumped 11 percent to
HK$6.61 as it resumed trading after being suspended on April 19.
Dongyue said it hasn’t reached an agreement on the terms of
share and bond sales.  Tencent Climbs  Among stocks that advanced,  Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700)  rose 1.1
percent to HK$236.60 after Bank of Communications Co. said the
popularity of one the online company’s new games is growing
faster than rivals’ offerings. An increase in Internet searches
for the new game suggests growing customer interest, said Connie
Gu, an analyst at Bank of Communications. Tencent had the
 biggest gain  on the Hang Seng Index today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
