The leader of Ontario’s opposition
 New Democratic Party , Andrea Horwath, said she will speak with
her caucus to discuss a meeting she had with Liberal Premier
Dalton McGuinty about the provincial budget.  “It was an interesting conversation and I’ll be likely
talking to you all a little bit later on,” Horwath told
reporters in Toronto. “We’re going to have time to have a more
formal conversation with you and Ontarians very shortly, but
first I need to speak to my caucus.”  The Liberals hold 53 of the provincial legislature’s 107
seats, meaning they need some opposition support to pass so-
called confidence motions such as budgets to remain in power.
The Progressive Conservatives led by Tim Hudak have 37 seats,
and Hudak has said all of his members will vote against the
budget. Horwath’s NDP has 17 seats.  To contact the reporter on this story:
