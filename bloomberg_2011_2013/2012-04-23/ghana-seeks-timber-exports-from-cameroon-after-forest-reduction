Ghana is seeking to purchase timber
from Cameroon after its own forestry resources were depleted,
said Lands and Natural Resources Minister Mike Hammah.  “We are here to explore what Cameroon has in terms of
forestry and wildlife and to discuss what Ghana can offer in the
spirit of intra-African trade,” he told reporters in Yaounde,
the Cameroonian capital, today. “Ghana could buy logs from
Cameroon and in turn share its reforestation experience with the
country,” Hammah said.  Cameroon wants to reduce its dependence on the
international market following economic uncertainty in  Europe ,
which accounts for 80 percent of wood sales, said Ngole Philip
Ngwese, Cameroon’s minister of forestry and wildlife.  To contact the reporter on this story:
