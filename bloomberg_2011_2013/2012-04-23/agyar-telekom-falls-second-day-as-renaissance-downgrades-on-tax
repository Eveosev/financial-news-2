Magyar Telekom Nyrt. (MTEL) , Hungary’s
former phone monopoly, fell for a second day as  Renaissance
Capital  cut its recommendation to hold from buy citing a report
that the government plans to tax phone and internet usage.  The shares of the company, which is controlled by  Deutsche
Telekom AG (DTE) , dropped 0.9 percent to 533 forint by 10:19 a.m. in
Budapest. Renaissance cut its price target for the stock to 573
forint from 641 forint, according to a report sent by e-mail
today.  The government may raise as much as 50 billion forint ($220
million) from the new tax to help plug budget holes next year
based on the Economy Ministry’s proposal, Origo reported on
April 20, citing unidentified people at the ministry.  “We think operators are unlikely to transfer the tax to
consumers via price increases” if the duty is imposed,
Alexander Kazbegi, an analyst at Renaissance, and colleagues
wrote in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
