Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann
said the German central bank wants to ensure that the euro
remains on a stable foundation.  “What we are doing is preserving the stability foundation
of the single currency,” Weidmann said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television’s “In the Loop” with Betty Liu. “If the
stability foundation of the euro is eroded, then we will also
see the acceptance of the single currency eroded.”  The Bundesbank has faced criticism, including from
billionaire  George Soros , for speaking out against some European
Central Bank crisis-fighting measures such as government bond
purchases. Weidmann said Soros’s charge that the Bundesbank is
preparing for the end of the euro is “ridiculous.”  “We shouldn’t get so excited about bond yields rising for
a limited period of time,” Weidmann said. “They also
constitute an incentive to reform, to embark on consolidation.”  The ECB, which has pumped more than 1 trillion euros ($1.3
trillion) into the banking system since December in a bid to
avert a credit crunch, has “done its job,” Weidmann said. He
added that governments must now press on with budget cuts and
structural reforms to encourage economic growth.  “It’s important to get the message to governments, ‘this
is your job now,’” Weidmann said.  The interview is scheduled to be broadcast at 2:35 p.m.
