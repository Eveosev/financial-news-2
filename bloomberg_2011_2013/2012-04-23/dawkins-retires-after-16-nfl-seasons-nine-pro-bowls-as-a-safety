Safety Brian Dawkins has retired
from the  National Football League  after a 16-year career that
included nine Pro Bowl selections and a Super Bowl appearance
with the  Philadelphia Eagles .  Dawkins, an unrestricted free agent, announced his
retirement today on his Twitter page. The 38-year-old safety
spent the last three years as a member of the  Denver Broncos ,
and missed four of the teamâ€™s final five games last season with
a neck injury.  Dawkins was a second-round pick of the Eagles in the 1996
NFL Draft, and became a starter during his rookie year. In 13
seasons with Philadelphia, which included four National Football
Conference title games and a Super Bowl appearance in 2005, he
had 21 sacks, 34 interceptions and 32 forced fumbles.  Dawkins signed with Denver prior to the 2009 season, when
he finished second on the team with 116 tackles. He was also
named a member of the NFL All-Decade Team for the 2000s.  -- Editors: Jay Beberman  To contact the reporter on this story:
