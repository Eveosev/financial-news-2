The U.S. Supreme Court let stand
the conviction of a former  Merrill Lynch & Co. (BAC)  banker for lying
to a grand jury about a fraudulent barge sale by Enron Corp.,
the now-defunct energy trader.  For the second time since 2007, the justices rejected an
appeal by James A. Brown, who has served a year in prison and is
seeking to avoid additional time.  Brown argued that his conviction should have been
overturned because prosecutors failed to turn over statements,
collected from Enron officials, that might have led the jury to
acquit him. A federal appeals court upheld a trial judge’s
conclusion that Brown’s rights weren’t violated.  The government is seeking to have Brown imprisoned for an
additional six to 12 months.  The case stems from Enron’s 1999 effort to disguise a loan
from Merrill as proceeds from the sale of three power-generating
barges moored off the coast of  Nigeria . Enron recorded $12
million in sham earnings from the transaction.  Brown was accused of lying when he told the grand jury he
wasn’t aware of promises by Enron that Merrill wouldn’t lose
money on the deal.  The case is Brown v.  United States , 11-783.  To contact the reporter on this story:
