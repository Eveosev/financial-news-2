Wheat traded in  London  and Paris
may have a “downside risk” compared with grain prices in
 Chicago  if European crop conditions improve and no crop issues
are seen in the U.S., the Home-Grown Cereals Authority said.  Feed wheat in London and milling wheat in Paris on NYSE
Liffe have advanced faster than grain prices on the Chicago
Board of Trade “due to current EU crop concerns,” the
Kenilworth, England-based HGCA said in a  report  on its website
today. Recent rains have helped European crops, while cool
weather slowed plant development, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
