Kellogg Co. (K) , the largest U.S. maker
of breakfast cereal, declined the most in more than five months
after reducing its full-year earnings forecast, citing weaker-
than-expected results in the first quarter.  Kellogg  fell  6.1 percent to $50.70 at the close in  New
York , for the biggest drop since Nov. 3. The shares have gained
0.3 percent this year.  Earnings per share, including the impact of its acquisition
of Pringles potato chips, will be $3.18 to $3.30, the Battle
Creek, Michigan-based company said today in a statement. Kellogg
previously predicted $3.25 to $3.37 a share. Analysts projected
$3.48, the average of  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer John Bryant said Kellogg faced
“more significant challenges” in  Europe  and some categories in
the U.S. in the first quarter than was expected. Net sales in
the first quarter declined about 1.3 percent while earnings of
$1 a share were unchanged from a year earlier, Kellogg said.  “We are obviously disappointed with the performance of the
company,” Bryant said in the statement.  In February, Kellogg agreed to buy  Procter & Gamble Co.’s (PG) 
Pringles business for about $2.7 billion in cash to triple its
global snack sales. The acquisition will lower full-year profit
by 6 cents to 11 cents a share, Kellogg said.  Full-year internal net sales, which exclude the impact of
foreign exchange translation and acquisitions and divestitures,
will increase at a rate of 2 percent to 3 percent. Internal
operating profit will decrease at a rate of 2 percent and 4
percent, Kellogg said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
