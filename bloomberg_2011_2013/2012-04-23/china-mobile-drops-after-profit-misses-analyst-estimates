China Mobile Ltd. (941) , the world’s
biggest phone carrier by users, fell the most in more than six
months in Hong Kong trading after the company reported profit
that missed analysts’ estimates.  China Mobile fell 3 percent to close at HK$84.80, the
biggest decline since Oct. 7. It had the third-biggest
percentage loss today on the city’s benchmark  Hang Seng Index (HSI) ,
which lost 1.8 percent.  First-quarter profit rose 3.5 percent to 27.8 billion yuan
($4.4 billion), China Mobile reported after the close of Hong
Kong markets on April 20. That compared with the 28.2 billion
yuan median of four analysts’ estimates in Bloomberg News survey.  Profit  margin  in the first-quarter fell to 21.8 percent
from 22.7 percent a year earlier because of stronger competition,
China Mobile said in its earnings release. The Beijing-based
carrier increased spending to attract users.  To contact the reporter on this story:
