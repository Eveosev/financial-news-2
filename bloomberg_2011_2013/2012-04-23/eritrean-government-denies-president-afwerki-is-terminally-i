Eritrea’s government denied what it
said was an “intensive campaign of rumor” in recent weeks
suggesting that President Isaias Afwerki is terminally ill and
his health is deteriorating.  “President Isaias is in robust health, and by all means of
medical standard is at the peak of his health,” the Asmara-
based Information Ministry said in a statement on its website
today. It didn’t say where the speculation had been reported.  Eritrea has been ruled by Afwerki, a former rebel leader,
since it gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993. The  United
Nations  has imposed sanctions on the Horn of Africa nation for
supporting al-Qaeda-linked militants fighting to topple the UN-
backed government of Somalia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
