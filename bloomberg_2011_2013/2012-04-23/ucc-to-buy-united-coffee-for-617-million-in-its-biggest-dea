UCC Holdings Co. will buy United
Coffee of  Switzerland  for about 50 billion yen ($617 million),
in the biggest acquisition the Japanese coffee maker has made so
far.  The closely held company will buy the Geneva, Switzerland-
based  coffee maker  from investment fund CapVest and the
management of the United Coffee, according to a statement today.
It is the biggest deal the company has made so far, according to
UCC Vice President Yasumasa Shimura.  The buyout enables UCC to enter  Europe  for the first time
and will bring the company’s sales from overseas markets to
about 20 percent from 3 percent. United Coffee operates in at
least in five European countries, including the Netherlands and
U.K., and had sales of 422 million euro in fiscal 2011.  “We will further propel the overseas business,” said Gota
Ueshima, UCC’s chief executive officer, said at a press
conference in  Tokyo  today. UCC plans to use borrowings from
banks and cash to finance the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
