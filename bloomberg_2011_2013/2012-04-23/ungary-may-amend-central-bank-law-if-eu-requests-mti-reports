 Hungary may further change its
central-bank law if amendments presented by the government last
week aren’t accepted by the European Union, state-owned news
service  MTI  reported, citing ruling-party lawmaker Antal Rogan.  The amendments didn’t address all the criticism from the
Hungarian central bank and the  European Central Bank , Andras Simor, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank’s president, told a parliamentary
committee hearing today, which Rogan led, MTI said.  The appointment of a third vice president and additional
members to the rate-setting Monetary Council, which would be
allowed under the law, would be “unjustified,” Simor told the
hearing today, MTI reported. Central bank salaries also remain
as a dispute to be solved, Simor said, according to MTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
