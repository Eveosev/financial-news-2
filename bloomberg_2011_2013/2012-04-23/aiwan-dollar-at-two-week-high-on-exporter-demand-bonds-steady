high as speculation the central bank will favor appreciation to
combat inflation encourages exporters to repatriate income.

island’s export orders fell 1.6 percent from a year earlier in
March, the government reported April 20. Data today showed

fourth drop in five months.  Consumer prices  rose 1.21 percent,

counterpart, and touched NT$29.395 earlier, the strongest level

gains today are mainly being driven by exporters selling the
greenback,” said Tarsicio Tong, a currency trader at  Union Bank
of Taiwan (2838)  in Taipei. “The currency has been hovering around
NT$29.50 for months. It’d be interesting to see if the central
bank will tolerate more appreciation to fight inflation.”  Inflation Fight  The central bank may allow faster gains in the local dollar
