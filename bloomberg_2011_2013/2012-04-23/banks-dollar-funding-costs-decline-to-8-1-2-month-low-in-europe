The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars fell for the fifth day to the lowest in more
than eight months, according to a money-market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 47 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:30 a.m. in
 London  from minus 47.5 on April 20, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The measure, which was 114 basis points at the start of
the year, is the cheapest level since Aug. 1.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 54 basis
points less than Euribor. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the
borrowing benchmark and overnight indexed swaps, rose. The
measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another was 40 basis
points from 39 on April 20, which was the lowest since Aug. 1.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
 European Central Bank  on April 20, placing 776 billion euros ($1
trillion) with the ECB from 746 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
