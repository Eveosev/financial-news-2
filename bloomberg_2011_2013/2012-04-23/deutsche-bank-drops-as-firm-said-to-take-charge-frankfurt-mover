Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  dropped as much as
2.1 percent in Frankfurt trading after the bank was said to
probably book an additional charge of as much as 400 million
euros ($528 million) tied to the sale of  Actavis Group hf .  The stock was down 1.9 percent at 33.83 euros as of 9:09
a.m. local time, valuing the company at about 31.4 billion
euros.  The bank may say it took an impairment of 300 million euros
to 400 million euros when it reports first-quarter results April
26, said people familiar with the process, who declined to be
identified because talks are private. Watson probably will
announce as early as tomorrow that it has agreed to buy Actavis
for about 4.5 billion euros, less than the value of the debt
Deutsche Bank holds, resulting in the charge, they said.  “A charge would be very disappointing,” said  Dirk Becker ,
a Frankfurt-based analyst at Kepler Capital Markets who
recommends investors buy Deutsche Bank shares. “I had thought a
gain to have been possible after they wrote down Actavis
several times over the last years.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
