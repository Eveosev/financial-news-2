Industrial espionage will cost
German companies about 4.2 billion euros ($5.5 billion) this
year,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported, citing a study by security
firms Corporate Trust and Brainloop, and TUEV SUED.  Almost every second company said it had fallen victim to
industrial espionage, with 20 percent citing attacks by one of
their competitors and 33 percent suffering from unidentified
information leaks, according to the report. The companies
surveyed said they were most exposed to attacks from  China ,
post-Soviet states and the U.S., the newspaper said. The study
surveyed 600 German companies in January and February this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
