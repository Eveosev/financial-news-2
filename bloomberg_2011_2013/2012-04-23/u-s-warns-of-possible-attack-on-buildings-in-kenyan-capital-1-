The U.S. Embassy in  Kenya  said it
received “credible” information about a possible attack on
hotels and government buildings in the East African country’s
capital, Nairobi.  While the “timing of the attack is not known,” the
Nairobi-based embassy said in an e-mailed statement today, “the
embassy has reason to believe that the potential attack is in
the last stages of planning.” It urged Americans in Kenya to
remain “vigilant” about their personal security.  Somalia’s al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabaab militia threatened to
carry out attacks in Kenya after the country deployed its army
in southern Somalia in mid-October to fight the militants. The
rebel group has waged a campaign since 2007 to topple Somalia’s
United Nations-backed government and establish an Islamic state.  Two weeks after the Kenyan incursion began, one person died
and at least 20 were injured in two separate bomb blasts in
Nairobi that the government said were inspired by al-Shabaab.  At least six people died and 68 were injured on March 10
when hand grenades were thrown from a moving car at people
waiting at a bus station on the outskirts of Nairobi. Al-Shabaab
denied responsibility for the attack.  The U.K. government in January updated its travel advice
for Kenya and advised its nationals to exercise “extra
vigilance and caution in public places.” Any attack may be
indiscriminate and target Kenyan institutions as well as places
where expatriates and foreign travellers gather, the Foreign
Office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
