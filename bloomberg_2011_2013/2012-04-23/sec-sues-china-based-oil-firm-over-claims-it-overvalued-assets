The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission sued a China-based oil field services company and two
senior executives over claims they deliberately misled investors
about the value of its assets and the use of $120 million from
its 2010 initial public offering.  SinoTech Energy Ltd. (CTESY)  told investors that the company
purchased $94 million worth of lateral hydraulic drilling units
when it had actually only bought $17 million worth, the SEC said
in a complaint filed today at U.S. District Court in the western
district of  Louisiana .  The company’s chairman was accused in the complaint of
siphoning $40 million in company funds. SinoTech didn’t record
the chairman’s withdrawal of company funds and kept him as
chairman even after he admitted to the conduct, according to the
SEC.  “SinoTech’s brief life as a public company in the U.S.
markets has been rife with falsehoods,” David Woodcock, head of
the SEC’s Fort Worth, Texas, office in  said in a statement.
“Investors deserve the utmost honesty and transparency from
companies and their officers when they tap public markets.”  Steven Schatz, an attorney for SinoTech at  Wilson Sonsini
Goodrich & Rosati , declined immediate comment.  The SEC is seeking unspecified financial penalties and
industry bars against the individuals.  To contact the reporters on this story:
