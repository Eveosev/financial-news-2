Oil fell from the highest price in
three days in  New York  after Chinese oil demand declined to the
lowest level in five months.  Futures slid as much as 0.7 percent, after gaining 0.2
percent last week.  China ’s apparent oil demand, or domestic
production minus net imports, slid to 9.51 million barrels a day
in March, the lowest level since October, according to Bloomberg
calculations from Chinese customs data released today. A
separate report indicated Chinese manufacturing may shrink for a
sixth month. The nation is the second-biggest oil consumer,
after the U.S.  “Negative data from China is contributing to oil’s
weakness today,” said  Christopher Bellew , a senior broker at
Jefferies Bache Ltd. in London, who correctly predicted Brent’s
advance to $120 a barrel earlier this year. “Brent has slipped
into a lower range, with the bottom around last week’s low at
$116.70, and resistance at $120.50.”  Crude for June delivery fell as much as 74 cents to $103.14
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $103.26 at 3:53 p.m. Singapore time. The
contract climbed 1.1 percent to $103.88 on April 20, the highest
close since April 17. Front-month prices have advanced 4.5
percent this year.  Brent oil for June settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange was down 46 cents, or 0.4 percent, at
$118.30 a barrel. The European benchmark contract was at a
premium of $15.04 to New York futures, compared with $14.88 on
April 20.  A preliminary reading of a purchasing managers index for
China by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics came in at 49.1
for April, compared with a final 48.3 in March. A number below
50 points to a contraction. China accounted for 11 percent of
the world’s oil consumption in 2010, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s
Statistical Review of World Energy. The U.S. accounted for 21
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
