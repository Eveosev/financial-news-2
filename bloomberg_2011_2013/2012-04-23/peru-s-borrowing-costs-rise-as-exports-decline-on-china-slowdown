Peru ’s benchmark borrowing costs in
dollars rose the most in two weeks as a slowing Chinese economy
curbs exports in the third-largest copper producer.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian government
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries  climbed  10 basis points, or 0.1
percentage point, to 172 at 3:34 p.m. in Lima, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  China’s purchasing managers’ index shrank to a preliminary
reading of 49.1 in April, compared with a final 48.3 in March,
according to HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics. A number
below 50 indicates a contraction. Peru’s exports fell 3.5
percent to $3.62 billion last month from the year-ago period
after metal prices declined, Lima-based exporter group Comexperu
said today in an e-mailed statement.  “There’s some slowing in  China  and that’s going to be
reflected in Peru’s export numbers,” said  Enrique Alvarez , the
head of Latin America fixed-income research at IdeaGlobal in New
York.  China is the top destination for Peru’s exports and
accounted for 17 percent of total shipments in the first
quarter, according to Comexperu.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose one basis point to 5.33
percent, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The price
fell 0.06 centimo to 116.61 centimos per sol.  The sol was little changed at 2.6520 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.6510 on April 20, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  The central bank didn’t  buy dollars  in the  spot market 
today, it said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
