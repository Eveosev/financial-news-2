A  BP Plc (BP/)  unit sued Bridas Corp. in
a U.S. court seeking a declaration that the South American oil-
exploration company’s agreement to buy BP’s controlling stake in
 Pan American  Energy LLC is valid.  BP Argentina Exploration Co., based in Houston, also asked
a judge to rule that Bridas isn’t entitled to a $700 million
termination fee if the agreement is deemed invalid, according to
a filing today in federal court in Manhattan.  The unit of London-based BP agreed in November 2010 to sell
its 60 percent stake in Pan American to Bridas, which held
40 percent, for $7.1 billion. In November, Bridas notified BP it
considered the purchase agreement “null and void” and said BP
failed to disclose certain “facts,” according to court papers.  “Bridas seeks to rescind” the agreement while the
contract terms “specifically provide that rescission is not an
available remedy,” BP said in the complaint.  Officials at Bridas offices in Buenos Aires didn’t
immediately return a phone call seeking comment on the lawsuit.
Bridas is owned by China’s  Cnooc Ltd. (883)  and Argentina’s
billionaire Bulgheroni family.  The case is BP Argentina Exploration Co. v. Bridas Corp.,
12-cv-3170, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York ,
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
