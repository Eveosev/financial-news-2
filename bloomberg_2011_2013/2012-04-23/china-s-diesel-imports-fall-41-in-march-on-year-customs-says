China ’s gasoline exports rose to
the highest level in 14 months in March after refineries ramped
up run rates to a record in the first two months of the year and
domestic fuel demand slowed.  Net gasoline exports, or imports minus exports, jumped to
520,008 metric tons last month, more than double February’s
206,075 tons, according to Bloomberg calculations based on
customs data released today. That’s the highest level since
January 2011. Apparent demand for all oil products, or domestic
production plus net imports, slid to a five-month low of 9.51
million barrels a day.  “Gasoline exports will probably return to normal levels at
around 300,000 tons a month from April as refineries enter
maintenance season,” Liao Kaishun, an analyst with C1 Energy,
said by telephone from Guangzhou.  China’s oil-refining volumes were at 9.32 million barrels a
day in February and a record 9.38 million in January. The
nation’s biggest oil refineries reduced operating rates to 79
percent of capacity as of April 12, the lowest level since
October, according to Oilchem.net.  China’s fuel demand rose 2.9 percent in the first quarter,
compared with 10 percent growth a year earlier, the National
Development and Reform Commission, the country’s top economic
planner, said April 19. Gasoline demand in January to March
expanded 8.8 percent from a year earlier, while diesel
consumption was little changed, it said.  The nation’s commercial gasoline inventory stood at 6.26
million tons at the end of February and 6.22 million at the end
of March, the highest levels since May last year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg based on reports from China Oil, Gas
& Petrochemicals, a newsletter published by the official Xinhua
News Agency.  China had net diesel exports of 96 tons in March, according
to today’s data. The nation imported 462,374 tons of jet
kerosene and exported 467,540 tons.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
