Ethanol climbed in  Chicago  as corn
and gasoline advanced on speculation that demand will improve.  The biofuel gained on optimism that corn’s 5 percent
decline this month will stoke global orders for the grain, the
primary ingredient for making ethanol in the U.S. Gasoline,
known as reformulated gasoline or RBOB, increased on speculation
that consumption will jump as the summer driving season nears.  “You have the strength in corn and the strength in RBOB,
and ethanol rallied with it,” said Matt Janney, a trader at
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in Chicago.  Denatured ethanol for May delivery advanced 1.6 cents, or
0.7 percent, to settle at $2.164 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Prices have dropped 1.8 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast dropped 2
cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.285 a gallon and in  New York  the
additive lost 1.75 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.2425, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago increased 0.5 cent to $2.135 a gallon
and in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel dropped 1 cent to $2.20.  Gasoline for May delivery jumped 4.46 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $3.1873 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Corn for July delivery advanced 9.5 cents, or 1.6 percent,
to $6.125 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
