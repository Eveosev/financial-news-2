Check Point Software Technologies
Ltd. (CHKP) , the world’s second-largest maker of security network
equipment, headed for the biggest decline since 2008 on concern
earnings growth will slow.  Shares of the Tel Aviv-based company dropped 8.1 percent to
$58.86 at 1:28 p.m. in New York, set for the steepest retreat
since Oct. 15, 2008.  Check Point  said first-quarter product licenses revenue
rose 5 percent from last year after growing 13 percent in 2011,
according to a Marketwire statement.  The company reported adjusted earnings of 74 cents per
share, beating the 72-cent median estimate of 27 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Check Point reaffirmed its forecast for
the year, Chief Executive Officer Gil Shwed said today in the
earnings call.  “Investors likely are concerned with full-year 2012
guidance being kept intact rather than upped, and product
license revenue growth of 5 percent year-on-year potentially
indicating decelerating growth in 2012,” Shaul Eyal, an analyst
at Oppenheimer & Co. in  New York , wrote in an e-mailed report
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
