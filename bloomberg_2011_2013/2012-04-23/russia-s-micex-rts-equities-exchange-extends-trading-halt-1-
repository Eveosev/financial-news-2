Russia’s Micex-RTS Exchange has
extended a technical halt and the situation is considered an
emergency, according to a  statement  on its website.  The reasons for the halt in trading “are unclear,” Micex-
RTS technical aide Artem Payzanskiy said by phone from Moscow.
The exchange is investigating the interruption, he said.  The halt has stopped trading of stocks during the evening
session of the  Micex Index (INDEXCF) ,  Luis Saenz , chief executive officer
of Otrkritie Financial Corp.’s New York unit, said by phone.
Trading in RTS Index  futures  is not being affected, Saenz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
