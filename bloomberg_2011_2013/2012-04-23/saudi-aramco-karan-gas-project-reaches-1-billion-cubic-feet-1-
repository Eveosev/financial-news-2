Saudi Arabian Oil Co. increased
production capacity at its offshore Karan natural-gas project to
1 billion standard cubic feet of fuel a day ahead of schedule
after completing treatment and sulfur-recovery units.  The Karan Gas Project will reach full planned capacity of
1.8 billion cubic feet a day by the second quarter, seven weeks
earlier than scheduled, the company known as  Saudi Aramco  said
in a  statement  on its website today.  Saudi Arabia holds the world’s largest oil reserves and the
fifth-largest gas deposits, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical
Review of World Energy. The country seeks to produce more gas to
run  power plants  and save crude for export as local electricity
demand grows by about 8 percent a year.  Saudi Aramco sped up development of the project with the
aim of completing the expansion this summer, a year ahead of
schedule, Chief Executive Officer Khalid al-Falih said in
January. The company originally aimed to produce 1.5 billion
cubic feet a day by June, according its 2010 annual review.  Dhahran-based Saudi Aramco started producing about 400
million cubic feet a day of gas from Karan last July to help
meet fuel demand during the peak Persian Gulf summer months when
air conditioning use stretches power supplies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
