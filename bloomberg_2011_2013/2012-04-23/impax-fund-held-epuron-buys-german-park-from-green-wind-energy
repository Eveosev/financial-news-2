Epuron Holding GmbH, a wind-power
developer held by an Impax Asset Management Ltd. fund, bought a
German wind park from a unit of Green Wind Energy A/S, which is
in “reconstruction proceedings” in  Denmark .  Epuron bought the 28-megawatt Cottbuser Halde park in
eastern  Germany  that has 14 turbines made by Vestas Wind Systems
A/S and has operated since early 2009, London-based Impax said
in a statement today without giving the terms of the deal. The
farm has a long-term loan from Deutsche Kreditbank AG, it said.  Green Wind “is currently in reconstruction proceedings
under Danish bankruptcy law,” Impax said. When contacted by
phone, officials at Green Wind’s Copenhagen office referred
questions to Danish law firm Gorrissen Federspiel, which didn’t
immediately provide a comment.  The purchase was funded by Impax New Energy Investors II
LP, the owner of Epuron since early 2011, according to the
statement. Green Wind’s listing on Nasdaq OMX Copenhagen was
deleted April 11, the exchange said in a statement at the time.  Impax Asset Management Ltd. is a wholly owned unit of  Impax
Asset Management Group Plc. (IPX)   To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
