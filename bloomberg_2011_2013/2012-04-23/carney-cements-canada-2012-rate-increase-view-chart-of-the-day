     April 23 (Bloomberg) --Investors have increased bets that
the Bank of Canada will move this year to raise  interest rates 
after Governor  Mark Carney  said on April 17 that removing
stimulus “may become appropriate” in light of stronger growth
and inflation.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows traders have priced in almost a
full quarter-percentage point of tightening by the central
bank’s Dec. 4 meeting, according to Bloomberg calculations on
overnight index swaps. That compares with about seven basis
points the day before the bank’s announcement and less than five
basis points April 11.  “By tweaking its forward-looking language, the bank has
put the prospect of a 2012 hike on the radar screen,” said
 David Tulk , chief Canada macro strategist at  Toronto-Dominion
Bank (TD) ’s TD Securities unit. “Expectations have shifted
dramatically to anticipate a hike by the end of the year.”  Carney, who has held the policy rate at 1 percent since
September 2010, is weighing the risks to inflation posed by
stronger growth and record household debt against an uneven
global recovery and the unresolved euro zone debt crisis. The
bank’s statement last week said “in light of the reduced slack
in the economy and firmer underlying inflation, some modest
withdrawal of the present considerable monetary policy stimulus
may become appropriate.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
