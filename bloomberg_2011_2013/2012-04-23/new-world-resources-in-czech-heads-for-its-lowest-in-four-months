New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the Czech
Republic biggest coking-coal producer, headed for the lowest in
more than four months as manufacturing shrank in the euro area
and  China , hurting demand for riskier assets.  The stock slumped 2.7 percent to 124 koruna by 1:40 p.m. in
Prague, on course for the lowest close since Dec. 19.  Services and manufacturing in the euro region, the biggest
buyer of Czech exports, contracted more than estimated in April,
to a five-month low, according to an index based on a survey of
purchasing managers by Markit Economics. The median estimate of
17 economists in a Bloomberg survey was for an increase to 49.3.  Chinese manufacturing remained in contraction territory for
a sixth month in April, according to a survey of companies. The
49.1 preliminary reading of the purchasing managersâ€™ index from
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics today compares with 48.3
the previous month. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
