Kenya Electricity Generating Co. (KEGC) ,
the east African nation’s biggest power producer, jumped to the
highest level in more than three months on improving market
share.  The stock rose by the daily limit of 10 percent before
trading 5.6 percent higher at 8.45 shillings by the close in the
capital, Nairobi. That’s the strongest level since Jan. 10 on a
closing basis, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “It has been recovering its lost market share from the
independent power producers with the onset of rains and
commissioning of new power stations,” Rufus Mwanyasi, head
trader at Nairobi-based Canaan Capital Ltd., said in a phone
interview today.  The market share of KenGen, as the company is known, has
recovered to about 60 percent after sliding to less than 50
percent 1 1/2 years ago, Mwanyasi said.  KenGen expects to produce 585 megawatts of electricity from
geothermal sources by 2018 and is also targeting production of
80 megawatts of thermal power and 120 megawatts of  wind energy 
by 2014, Managing Director Edward Njoroge said Feb. 29.
Hydroelectric plants provide about 65 percent of  Kenya ’s power
generation, according to the company’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
