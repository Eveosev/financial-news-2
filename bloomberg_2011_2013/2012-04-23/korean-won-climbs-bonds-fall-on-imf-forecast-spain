South Korea’s won halted a two-day
decline after the  International Monetary Fund  was pledged more
than $430 billion to safeguard the world economy.  Government
bonds  were little changed.  The near-doubling of the IMF’s firepower was announced
after Group of 20 finance ministers and central bankers met last
week in Washington. South Korea’s finance minister Bahk Jae Wan
visited  Standard & Poor’s  on April 20 and asked for an upgrade
on the nation’s sovereign rating, Maeil Business Newspaper
reported today. The won erased earlier gains as  North Korea 
threatened through its state media today that it will take
“special action” against the South’s President  Lee Myung Bak .  “The IMF’s boost in lending power and South Korea asking
for a rating upgrade are positive for the won, but effects will
be limited as the IMF report was pretty much expected,” said
Hong Seok Chan, a Seoul-based currency analyst at Daeshin
Economy Research Institute. “With events including the Federal
Reserve meeting coming up this week, the won will continue to
trade within a range.”  The won closed at 1,139.50 per dollar in  Seoul , compared
with 1,139.55 at the end of last week, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency earlier gained as much as
0.2 percent. One-month implied volatility for the won, a measure
of exchange-rate swings used to price options, dropped 23 basis
points, or 0.23 percentage point, to 7.80 percent.  Federal Reserve officials release their projections for U.S.
economic growth and the appropriate path for the benchmark
interest rate this week. South Korea’s  economy  probably expanded
2.9 percent in the first quarter, the least since the three
months ended September 2009, according to the median estimate in
a Bloomberg News survey. Official figures are due April 26.  The yield on South Korea’s 3.25 percent bonds due December
2014 was steady at 3.47 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show.
Three-year debt futures declined 0.03 to 104.13 and the one-year
 interest-rate  swap was little changed at 3.50 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
