The  Bank of England ’s new powers
have saddled the governor with so many responsibilities that the
job is almost impossible, opposition Labour Party lawmaker  Ed Balls  wrote in today’s Financial Times.  The person who replaces  Mervyn King  when his term ends in
June 2013 “will face a near-impossible task,” said Balls, who
speaks for Labour on financial matters. The position “is made
all the harder by the flaws in the Bank of England reform
bill,” to be discussed in Parliament today.  The bill needs to establish greater clarity over the bank’s
multiple goals and accountability over its powers, Balls said.
Parliament should also have scope to debate the Financial Policy
Committee’s proposed regulations, and the chancellor of the
exchequer should make clear who is responsible during a crisis.  King’s replacement could come from outside the bank or an
internal candidate, Balls wrote.  “Wisdom and experience are vital for good leadership --
qualities that in my view could be found equally well in an
external as an internal successor,” Balls wrote. “If the
governor is to have a fair chance of success, the flaws in
objectives, accountability and  crisis management  must be
resolved immediately.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
