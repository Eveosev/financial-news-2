Eurasia Drilling Co. (EDCL)  climbed for a
third day after  Russia ’s largest traded oilfield services
company said it expects to beat last year’s onshore drilling
record as demand increases.  Eurasia’s global depositary receipts advanced 0.4 percent
to $28 as of 10:19 a.m. in  London .  The Russian Depositary Index (RDXUSD) 
of London-traded shares of Russian companies sank 2.9 percent to
1,726.07, while Russia’s benchmark Micex stock gauge slid 2.5
percent to 1,468.14.  Net income rose 34 percent in 2011 to $277 million after
Eurasia drilled 4.8 million meters onshore, the Moscow-based
company said today on its website. The number of meters will
likely rise a further 15 percent this year, Chief Financial
Officer  Richard Anderson  said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
