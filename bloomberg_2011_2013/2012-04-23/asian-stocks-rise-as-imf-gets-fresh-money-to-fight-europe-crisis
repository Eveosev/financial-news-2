Asian  stocks  fell, with the
regional benchmark index heading for a third straight decline,
after companies from Daewoo Engineering & Construction Co. to
 Tokyo  Steel Manufacturing Co. posted weaker earnings and a
report  China ’s manufacturing may shrink for a sixth month.  Daewoo Engineering dropped 4.4 percent in  Seoul  after the
construction company posted a 38 percent drop in first-quarter
operating profit. Tokyo Steel slumped 7.6 percent as the
steelmaker’s full-year loss widened.  China Mobile Ltd. (941) , the
world’s biggest carrier by subscribers, fell 3 percent in  Hong
Kong  after posting first-quarter net income that missed
analysts’ estimates.  “Investors are taking a wait-and-see attitude as some
earnings disappoint,” said Ng Soo Nam, Singapore-based chief
investment officer at Nikko Asset Management Asia Ltd., which
oversees about $165 billion. “Even if more earnings were to
come in at below expectations, we are still staring at very
cheap equity valuations. There’s still scope for the market to
move up.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 0.5 percent to 123.61
as of 5:08 p.m. in Tokyo, erasing gains of as much as 0.3
percent. More than two shares fell for each that rose in the
measure. The gauge posted its fourth weekly retreat this year
last week as the Group of 20 nations warned  Europe ’s debt crisis
still threatens global growth and as reports showed economic
expansion is slowing in the U.S. and China.  China Manufacturing  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  dropped 0.2 percent,
erasing gains of as much as 0.9 percent. South Korea’s Kospi
Index lost 0.1 percent and  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
declined 0.3 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index sank 1.8
percent.  China’s Shanghai Composite Index slid 0.8 percent as a
survey showed the nation’s manufacturing may contract for a
sixth month in April. The 49.1 preliminary reading of the
Purchasing Managers’ Index from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics today compares with a final figure of 48.3 in March. A
number below 50 points to a contraction.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 9.1 percent this year
through last week, compared with a 9.6 percent advance by the
 S&P 500  and a 5.4 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600
Index. Stocks in the Asian benchmark were valued at 12.7 times
 estimated earnings  on average, compared with 13.1 times for the
S&P 500 and 10.8 times for the Stoxx 600.  Of the 50 companies on the regional benchmark index that
reported quarterly net income since April 10, 31 exceeded
analysts’ estimates, while 15 missed expectations, according to
 data  compiled by Bloomberg News.  Earnings Performance  Daewoo Engineering dropped 4.4 percent 9,800 won in Seoul.
Operating profit fell to 51.2 billion won ($45 million) in the
three months that ended March 31 from 82.3 billion won a year
earlier, Daewoo said on April 20.  Tokyo Steel (5423)  sank 7.6 percent to 642 yen after saying losses
widened to 14.3 billion yen ($176 million) in the year ended
March 31 from 10.4 billion yen 12 months earlier on higher
production costs.  Nippon Yusen K.K., Japan’s largest shipping line by sales,
slid 1.7 percent to 237 yen after reporting a preliminary full-
year loss of 73 billion yen, wider than its forecast of a 26
billion yen loss, due to a slowdown in its logistics business
and the reversal of deferred taxes assets.  China Mobile slid 3 percent to HK$84.80 in Hong Kong after
reporting first-quarter profit rose 3.5 percent from a year
earlier to 27.8 billion yuan ($4.4 billion). That compared with
the 28.2 billion yuan median estimate of four analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg News.  U.S. Futures  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 1
percent today. The index gained 0.1 percent in  New York  on April
20 as profits from companies including Microsoft Corp. and
General Electric Co. beat estimates and a report showed German
business confidence improved.  Asian stocks initially advanced today after the
 International Monetary Fund  received more than $430 billion in
pledges at the G-20 meeting in  Washington  over the weekend,
nearly-doubling the IMF’s firepower in addressing Europe’s debt
crisis. The group said in a statement that downside risks remain
in the world economy and that volatility is high in part because
of pressures in Europe.  Among stocks that advanced, Yakult Honsha Co. jumped 12
percent to 3,075 yen, its highest close since October 2008,
after the Nikkei newspaper reported Danone may increase its
stake in  Japan ’s largest non-alcoholic beverages maker. Paris-
based Danone owns about 20 percent of Yakult, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
