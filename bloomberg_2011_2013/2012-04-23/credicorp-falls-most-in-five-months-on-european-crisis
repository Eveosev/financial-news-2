Credicorp Ltd. (BAP)  fell the most in
more than five months as investors concerned about Europe’s debt
crisis sold Peruvian banking stocks.  Credicorp, which owns the country’s largest bank, dropped
2.3 percent to $128.09 at 2:56 p.m. in Lima trading, the
steepest decline on a closing basis since Nov. 9.  “There was a contagion effect because of Credicorp’s New
York-traded ADR,” Edwin Paz, a Lima-based trader with Provalor
SAB, said today in a telephone interview. “We could see further
declines due to the European crisis.”  U.S. stocks including  Bank of America Corp.  and Citigroup
Inc. joined a global sell-off as the prospect of imminent
changes in government in France and the Netherlands intensified
concern about  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis.  Socialist Francois Hollande and President Nicolas Sarkozy
progressed to the final round of France’s election, with the
incumbent’s hopes of victory resting on winning supporters from
Marine Le Pen’s anti-euro National Front.  Dutch Prime Minister  Mark Rutte  is set to test opposition
backing for fresh austerity measures aimed at shielding the
Netherlands from the debt crisis after he pulled the plug on his
government and offered early elections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
