Spain ’s economy contracted 0.4
percent in the first quarter, the Bank of Spain estimated, as
the economy officially entered a recession that threatens to
undermine its deficit goals.  Gross domestic product fell 0.5 percent from a year ago,
the Bank of Spain said, citing estimates based on data that’s
still incomplete. The National Statistics Institute publishes
its first estimate on April 30.  Spain’s government is struggling to convince investors it
can narrow the deficit by 3 percentage points of its GDP this
year even as the economy contracts and unemployment exceeds 23
percent. The government forecasts a contraction of 1.7 percent
this year.  Spain’s 10-year bond yield rose to 5.99 percent today from
5.96 percent on April 20, widening the gap over German
equivalents to 432 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
