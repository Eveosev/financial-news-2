The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
fund guaranteeing customer deposits in U.S. banks is rebuilding
at a faster pace as  bank failures  slow from their 2010 peak, the
agency said in a report today.  The federal backstop, funded by assessments on  banks , was
at $11.8 billion at the end of 2011, up from a deficit of $20.9
billion at the end of 2009 as the credit crisis caused banks to
fail. The FDIC predicted it will spend $12 billion to cover bank
shutdowns through 2016, according to a report updating the
fund’s health. That five-year cost is $7 billion less than the
FDIC’s last five-year projection in October.  The fund remains below its required reserve ratio of 1.15
percent of the deposits it insures and the agency expects it to
reach that goal by the latter half of 2018. The FDIC says it
anticipates this year’s assessments on banks to stay at about
the same $13.5 billion level as in the previous two years. The
reserve ratio was at 0.17 percent at the end of 2011, the agency
said. The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 required the FDIC to increase
the target ratio to 1.35 percent -- a level it must reach by
Sept. 30, 2020.  The fund returned to a positive balance last year. Last
week,  Fort Lee  Federal Savings Bank of Fort Lee,  New Jersey 
became the 17th FDIC-insured institution to fail this year,
estimated to cost the fund $14 million.  ‘Problem List’ Shrinks  The number of banks on the FDIC’s confidential “problem
list” has been declining, going from 844 to 813 in the final
quarter of 2011, according to the agency’s quarterly banking
profile.  “The FDIC has been overly conservative in setting aside
reserves for possible failures that did not occur,” said  James Chessen , executive vice president and chief economist of the
Washington-based  American Bankers Association , in a statement
that argued assessments are too high for what the fund needs.
“Banks will provide more than $65 billion in revenue over the
next five years, more than five times what the FDIC expects in
failure costs.”  The FDIC reports new five-year projections for the fund’s
health twice a year. Today’s meeting of the board was the first
for new members  Thomas Hoenig  and Jeremiah O. Norton, who were
sworn in last week after recent Senate confirmations, which also
established FDIC board member Thomas J. Curry as chief of the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
