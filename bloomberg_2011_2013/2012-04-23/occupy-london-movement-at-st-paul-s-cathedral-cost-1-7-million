Occupy  London  protesters who camped
outside  St. Paul’s Cathedral  for more than four months cost the
City of London and its police authority more than 1.06 million
pounds ($1.7 million) in legal and monitoring costs, according
to their response to a Freedom of Information request.  The protest encampment, the anti-capitalism campaigners’
largest in London, cost the financial district 120,000 pounds in
legal fees and 28,000 pounds in health and safety expenses, City
of London Police said in an e-mail. The neighborhood’s police
authority spent 525,257 pounds to move officers from other
duties and 386,434 pounds in expenses such as overtime.  Wealth disparities fueled protests around the globe last
year. The Occupy Movement began in September, when protesters
took up residence in  New York ’s Zuccotti Park to highlight the
plight of Americans who suffered even as the largest U.S. banks
recovered from the 2008 financial crisis.  Demonstrators inspired by the Occupy Wall Street protests
in New York moved to St. Paul’s in October, leading to the
cathedral’s temporary closure later that month. Police
dismantled tents and makeshift shelters when they evicted Occupy
London demonstrators from their campsite outside St. Paul’s on
Feb. 28.  The last remaining camp in Finsbury Square cost Islington
council 10,000 pounds to monitor, according to a response from a
separate Freedom of Information request. Bloomberg LP’s European
headquarters are located on Finsbury Square.  Evicting protesters from their encampment around  City Hall 
in November cost Los Angeles taxpayers $2.35 million, officials
said Dec. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
