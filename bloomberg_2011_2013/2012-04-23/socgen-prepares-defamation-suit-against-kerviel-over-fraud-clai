Societe Generale SA (GLE)  has asked its
lawyers to prepare a defamation complaint against its former
trader,  Jerome Kerviel , following his lawyer’s announcement that
a fraud complaint was filed against the bank.  Kerviel, found guilty in 2010 for the bank’s 4.9 billion-
euro ($6.4 billion) trading loss and ordered to repay the
amount, accused  Societe Generale  of deceiving the judges on the
amount of the loss by hiding a 1.7 billion-euro tax credit it
received on the loss, his lawyer, David Koubbi, said on  Europe 1 
radio on April 20.  Societe Generale “takes note of the complaint by Jerome
Kerviel,”  France ’s second-largest bank said in an e-mailed
statement after Koubbi’s announcement. “Societe Generale has
asked its lawyers to file a defamation complaint as soon as
possible and will make its case during the appeal” by Kerviel
against the lower court judgment, scheduled for June.  Kerviel, 35, was found guilty of breach of trust,
forging documents and computer hacking. He amassed 50 billion
euros in unauthorized positions concealed with faked hedges. The
lower court judges rejected arguments that his superiors knew he
exceeded his limits and the bank made a mistake by unwinding the
bets over three days of falling markets in 2008.  Koubbi didn’t return messages left at his office and on his
mobile phone seeking comment.  Agence France-Presse reported the complaints earlier  To contact the reporter on this story:
