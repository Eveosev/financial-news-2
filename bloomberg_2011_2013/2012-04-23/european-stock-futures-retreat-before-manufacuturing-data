European stocks  fell to a three-
month low as manufacturing contracted in the euro area and China
and as Dutch Prime Minister  Mark Rutte  offered to resign after
struggling to clinch an austerity deal.  Renault SA (RNO)  and  ArcelorMittal (MT)  led a selloff in automakers
and commodity companies.  ING Groep NV (INGA)  and  Aegon NV (AGN)  tumbled more
than 6 percent amid concern the Netherlands may lose its AAA
rating. Royal Philips Electronics NV rallied 3.3 percent after
earnings beat analysts’ estimates.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped 2.3 percent to
251.75 in London, the lowest since Jan. 16. The gauge last week
snapped a four-week losing streak after the International
Monetary Fund raised its global growth forecast and U.S. company
earnings beat estimates.  “There is every reason for this market to correct today,”
said Patrick Moonen, a senior strategist at ING Investment
Management in The Hague, which manages $163 billion. “The
political environment in Europe has not improved over the
weekend and we’ve had some weaker-than-expected macro data that
is clearly disappointing. The overall market sentiment has
turned bearish, but I am not at all concerned that this is more
than a correction.”  Euro-area services and manufacturing contracted more than
estimated in April, to a five-month low. A  composite index  based
on a survey of purchasing managers in both industries fell to
47.4 from 49.1 in March, London-based Markit Economics said in
an initial estimate. Economists had forecast an increase to
49.3, according to a Bloomberg News survey. A reading below 50
indicates contraction.  Chinese Output  Chinese manufacturing also shrank for a sixth month in
April, according to a survey of companies. The 49.1 preliminary
reading of the purchasing managers’ index from HSBC Holdings Plc
and Markit today compared with a final 48.3 the previous month.  In the Netherlands, Rutte offered his Cabinet’s resignation
after one of the parties in his minority coalition withdrew
support.  Queen Beatrix  will consider the resignation, the
government’s information service said.  National benchmark indexes dropped in all of 18 western
European markets except Iceland. The Netherlands’ AEX declined
2.6 percent to the lowest level this year. France’s CAC 40 lost
2.8 percent, the U.K.’s FTSE 100 slid 1.9 percent and Germany’s
DAX retreated 3.4 percent. Sweden’s OMX tumbled 4.6 percent, the
biggest drop since September.  French Elections  Elsewhere, French President Nicolas Sarkozy became the
first incumbent since 1958 not to win the first round of the
nation’s election.  Socialist Francois Hollande won 28.6 percent of the vote
against 27.2 percent for Sarkozy. The anti-immigrant Marine Le
Pen got 17.9 percent, a record for her party that surpassed the
predictions of all pollsters. The second round of elections
takes place on May 6.  “One potential change of government in the euro zone is
bad enough,” said Chris Beauchamp, a markets analyst at IG
Index in London. “With the Dutch government falling apart as
well, investors  have been well and truly spooked,”  A gauge of auto-industry companies was the second-worst
performer among the  19 industry groups  in the Stoxx 600,
tumbling 3.7 percent.  Daimler AG (DAI)  lost 4.2 percent to 39.50
euros,  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , which today said it expects
the pace of sales growth in China to ease, fell 4.1 percent to
67 euros and Renault SA sank 5.1 percent to 33.70 euros.  Commodity Shares Fall  Basic-resource companies also retreated. ArcelorMittal, the
world’s largest steelmaker, dropped 5.3 percent to 12.25 euros.
 Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  declined 5.7 percent to 1,167 pence and
 Antofagasta Plc (ANTO)  slid 3.2 percent to 1,140 pence.  In Madrid, construction shares tumbled, led by Actividades
de Construction y Servicios S.A., the biggest Spanish builder,
which lost 10 percent to 13.50 euros.  Fomento de Construcciones
y Contratas SA (FCC)  dropped 7.2 percent to 12.15 euros and  Sacyr
Vallehermoso SA (SYV)  plummeted 12 percent to 1.40 euros.  “People are running away from anything that is Spanish and
leveraged,” said Luis Benguerel, a trader at Interbrokers
Espanola in Barcelona. “Banks are being dumped because they
have the credit and builders being sold because they took money
to build up their business and cannot pay back now.”  Ericsson AB, the biggest maker of wireless  network
equipment , declined 4.4 percent to 61.60 kronor in Stockholm,
while STMicroelectronics, Europe’s largest semiconductor maker,
declined 14 percent to 4.31 euros in Paris. The chipmaking joint
venture of the two companies plans to cut 1,700 jobs and reduce
costs by $320 million a year by the end of 2013.  ING, Aegon Retreat  ING, the largest Dutch financial-services company, dropped
6.1 percent to 5.23 euros as Dutch 10-year bonds fell, driving
the yield difference to German bunds to a three-year high.
Aegon, owner of U.S. insurer Transamerica Corp., plunged 6.7
percent to 3.40 euros and  SNS Reaal NV (SR) , a Dutch lender and
insurer, plunged 9.1 percent to 1.40 euros.  “The risk has heightened the Netherlands may be downgraded
and lose its AAA rating,”  Nick Kounis , head of macro research
at ABN Amro Group NV in Amsterdam, said in a telephone interview
yesterday. “I don’t see a majority in parliament to bring the
deficit to 3 percent. So hopefully the politicians will get
their act together as the country has a long history of fiscal
prudence,” Kounis said.  Deutsche Bank Charge  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  paced a selloff in European banks, falling
4.4 percent to 32.98 euros in Frankfurt. Germany’s largest
lender will probably book an additional charge of as much as 400
million euros ($528 million) tied to the sale of Actavis Group
hf, according to people familiar with the transaction.  Natixis (KN)  retreated 8.2 percent to 2.12 euros and  Credit
Agricole SA (ACA)  dropped 4.5 percent to 3.57 euros in Paris trading,
while  KBC Groep NV (KBC)  sank 7.3 percent to 13.01 euros in Belgium.  Philips limited losses in Amsterdam, rallying 3.3 percent
to 14.82 euros, after the world’s biggest light-bulb maker
reported profit that beat analysts’ estimates after cutting
costs and selling assets.  Cable & Wireless Worldwide Plc (CW/)  jumped 12 percent to 35.9
pence after  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  agreed to buy the U.K. company
for 1.04 billion pounds ($1.7 billion). The world’s largest
wireless operator offered 38 pence a share after India’s Tata
Communications Ltd. last week failed to agree on a price.  Danone (BN)  gained 1.3 percent to 53.13 euros after  Nestle SA (NESN) 
agreed to buy Pfizer Inc.’s baby-food unit for $11.9 billion,
edging out the French company in a contest for a business that
gets most of its sales in emerging markets.  Nestle’s offer beat a bid of about $11 billion from Danone,
according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Nestle
gained 0.6 percent to 55.50 euros in Zurich, adjusted for lost
dividend rights.  To contact the reporter on this story:
