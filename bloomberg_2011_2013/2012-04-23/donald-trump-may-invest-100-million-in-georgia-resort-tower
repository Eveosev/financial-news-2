Donald J. Trump , the U.S. real-
estate developer, said he may invest more than $100 million in a
residential high-rise on the Black Sea coast of  Georgia  as he
considers projects in other former Soviet Union countries.  “I’ll be putting something in, but that has not been
determined yet,” Trump said in an April 21 interview in the
Georgian capital, Tbilisi. “For the job itself, it will be more
than $100 million.”  Trump, who traveled to Georgia after a visit to Istanbul,
unveiled the 47-story Trump Tower Batumi project with Georgian
President Mikheil Saakashvili and partner  Silk Road Group , one
of the country’s biggest private-investment companies. A deal to
develop the project was signed in  New York  in March.  “Batumi is becoming quite a place, it’s the best location,
the  Monte Carlo  of the region,” Trump said. Silk road will be
responsible for fundraising, he said.  Trump was approached by a Russian real estate developer a
few months ago about “something very substantial in Moscow,”
he said.  Georgia was ranked as the world’s third-fastest growing
tourist destination last year, with a 39 percent increase in
international arrivals, according to a March report by the World
Tourism Barometer.  The country’s $11.6 billion economy grew about 7 percent in
2011, the statistics office said, citing preliminary data. Gross
domestic product rose 8.8 percent from a year earlier in the
fourth quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
