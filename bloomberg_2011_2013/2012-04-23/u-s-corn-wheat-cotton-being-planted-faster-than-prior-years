U.S. corn, spring-wheat and cotton
crops are being planted faster than the previous five-year
average after unusually warm March temperatures and April rain
left soils ready for fieldwork, the government said.  About 28 percent of the corn crop, the worldâ€™s biggest,
was planted as of April 22, up from 17 percent a week earlier
and 8 percent a year earlier, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said today in a  report . The average was 15 percent
at this time of year from 2007 to 2011.  About 57 percent of the spring-wheat crop was seeded as of
yesterday, up from 37 percent a year earlier, the department
said. The average for the date for the previous five years is
19 percent.  Cotton planting  was 17 percent completed, compared with 13
percent a week earlier and 13 percent on average the prior five
years, the USDA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
