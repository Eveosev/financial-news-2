Thailand ’s baht fell, extending
this year’s biggest weekly decline, on speculation China’s
economic slowdown and Europe’s debt crisis will hamper a
recovery in the Southeast Asian nation’s exports.  The currency touched the weakest level since April 11
before a report this week that may show overseas sales rose 0.1
percent in March from a year earlier, compared with a 0.9
percent gain the previous month, according to the median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey. Asian stocks fell
for a third day as European officials resisted calls from the
 International Monetary Fund  and  U.S. Treasury  to do more to stem
debt troubles.  “The weakness in the  Thai baht  is due to the situation in
 Europe  that’s causing some small capital outflows,” said Kampon Adireksombat, an economist in Bangkok at Tisco Securities Co.
Ltd. “Apart from a base effect, exports are also affected by
the slowdown in China and Europe.”  The baht retreated 0.2 percent to 30.97 per dollar as of
3:35 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It fell to 31.00 earlier, the weakest level since April 11. The
currency lost 0.6 percent last week, the most since the five
days ended Dec. 30.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of foreign-exchange
swings used to price options, fell to 4.52 percent from 4.54
percent on April 20. The MSCI  Asia Pacific (MXAP)  Index of stocks lost
0.1 percent.  Baht Outlook  The baht will trade between 30 and 31 this year,
Adireksombat said. The nation’s exports may grow 10 percent this
year, compared with the government’s forecast for a 15 percent,
he predicted.  China  and Europe each accounts for 10 percent of
Thai shipments, according to him. An HSBC Holdings Plc/Markit
report today showed manufacturing in China likely contracted for
a sixth month in April.  The yield on the Thai government’s 3.25 percent bonds due
June 2017 dropped four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point,
to 3.48 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
fell 17 basis points in a three-week rally through April 20.  The government will auction 8 billion baht ($258 million)
of 2027 bonds on April 25, according to its sale calendar. It
last sold 10 billion baht of similar-maturity notes on Feb. 29
at 3.775 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
