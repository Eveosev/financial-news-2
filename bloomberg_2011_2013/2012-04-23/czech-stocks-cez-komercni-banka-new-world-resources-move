The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
dropped 1.7 percent to 911.2 at its close in  Prague , the lowest
in three months.  The following were among the most active  equities  on the
Prague Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  CEZ AS (CEZ)  , the country’s biggest power utility, slid
1.8 percent to 758.9 koruna, its largest drop and lowest closing
price in a week. Electricity for next-year delivery in Germany,
where CEZ exports part of its output, retreated 0.6 percent to
50.85 euros per megawatt-hour.  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  , Societe Generale SA’s Czech
unit, slumped 3.1 percent to 3,315 koruna, its lowest in more
than three months. Financial stocks were among the biggest
losers as manufacturing shrank in  China  and the euro area and
concern rose that Europe will struggle to contain budget
deficits.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)  , the biggest Czech coking-
coal producer, slumped to its lowest in since July 2009, sliding
4.6 percent to 121.51 koruna. Europe’s benchmark  coal 
derivatives slid 0.9 percent to $111 a metric ton in the
Netherlands, the lowest in 16 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
