BTG Plc (BGC) ’s Varisolve treatment for
varicose veins led to “a significant improvement” in symptoms
in a late-stage clinical trial, and the company plans to seek
U.S. regulatory approval by the end of the year.  The Vanish-1 trial is the second late-stage study to show
the drug works, London-based BTG said in a statement today.  The medicine, also called by its chemical name PEM, would
be the first non-surgical treatment for varicose veins on the
legs, according to the company. No serious or unexpected side
effects were reported across the two late-stage studies, in
which 590 patients received treatment, BTG said.  “With these strong efficacy results and the demonstrated
safety profile, PEM should become an important new treatment
option,” Ted King, national medical director of Vein Clinics of
America in Greenwich,  Connecticut , and one of the trial’s
researchers, said in the statement.  BTG  declined  as much as 1 percent to 381.4 pence at 8:10
a.m. in  London . That pared the stock’s gain this year to 22
percent.  Varisolve works by being injected into a vein, where it
displaces the blood and then chemically excises the inner lining
of the vein wall, causing the vein to close. Peak annual sales
of the drug may reach as much as $500 million, BTG said last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
