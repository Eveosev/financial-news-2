OAO Sberbank,  Russia ’s largest
bank, will be the “key investor” in Luxembourg-based Russian
equity and bond funds being created by its Troika Dialog Asset
Management unit.  The equity and bond funds will be structured as
Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable
Securities, or UCITS, a regulated European fund format. They’ll
be offered to international and Russian domestic investors, with
the equity and bond funds getting $50 million apiece, the
statement said.  Troika Dialog Asset Management has a total of $3.2 billion
in funds under management, according to the statement. The  fund
manager  is being integrated into state-controlled Sberbank,
which acquired the Troika Dialog brokerage group in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
