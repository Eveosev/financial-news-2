Kuwait  National Petroleum Co.
started the “prequalification exercise” for engineering,
procurement and construction contractors to build a new 4
billion-dinar ($14.4 billion) oil refinery and upgrade two
existing refineries, a KNPC official said.  “We started the prequalification exercise yesterday, by
announcing whoever is interested to participate in the two big
projects should come to collect documents for evaluation by
KNPC,” Hatem Al-Awadhi, deputy managing director for projects,
said in a phone interview today from Kuwait. “By October, our
target is to issue the tender documents for both projects.”  The projects include a new 615,000 barrel-a-day refinery
and a Clean-Fuels Project, which involves the upgrade of two of
Kuwait’s three existing refineries. Kuwait in January 2009 put
on hold the planned new oil refinery after coming under pressure
from opposition lawmakers who said the awarding of contracts to
international companies circumvented the law by not going
through the Central Tenders Committee.  KNPC obtained final approval from all internal committees,
including the CTC and Supreme Petroleum Council, the country’s
highest oil decision-making body, Al-Awadhi said. The company
has also issued tender documents for project management
consultants for both projects, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
