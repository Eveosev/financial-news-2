     April 23 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  stocks  fell for a third
day, extending a three-week decline, as utility shares dropped
on public opposition to nuclear power and shipping companies
slid on disappointing earnings.  Kansai Electric Power Co. (9503)  dropped 4.2 percent after a poll
showed more than half the public was critical of the
government’s plan to restart the utility’s nuclear reactors.
Nippon Yusen K.K., Japan’s top shipping line by sales, fell 1.7
percent after posting a wider-than-expected loss. Mitsui
Chemicals Inc. retreated 4.1 percent after an explosion at its
industrial glue factory killed a worker yesterday.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  fell 0.2 percent to 9,542.17
at the 3 p.m. trading close in Tokyo after earlier rising as
much as 0.9 percent. The broader Topix Index lost 0.3 percent to
809.54. Trading volume was 30 percent below the 30-day average
ahead of policy meetings by the U.S. Federal Open Market
Committee and the  Bank of Japan  this week.  “Investors would like to sit on the fence ahead of major
events such as the FOMC and BOJ meetings,” said Takeru Ogihara,
chief strategist in Tokyo at Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., a unit
of Japan’s third-largest lender by market value. “We are not
seeing big factors moving the market.”  The benchmark Nikkei 225 has retreated 7 percent since
March 27 on renewed concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis is
spreading and signs  China’s economy  is slowing. Japan’s central
bank is expected to expand asset purchases further at a meeting
on April 27, Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities Co., Mizuho and SMBC
Nikko predict. The Fed is scheduled to announce its rate
decision on April 25.  Utilities Drop  Power companies fell the  most  among the Topix’s 33 industry
groups after the Nikkei newspaper reported today 54 percent of
the respondents to a survey were critical of the government’s
assessment that it was safe to restart two of  Kansai Electric ’s
idled nuclear reactors. The stock slid 4.2 percent to 1,206 yen.  Shikoku Electric Power Co. fell 5.2 percent to 2,113 yen.
Tokyo Electric Power Co., owner of the crippled Fukushima Dai-
Ichi nuclear plant, declined 2.5 percent to 197 yen.  Nippon Yusen led shippers lower. The company slid 1.7
percent to 237 yen after reporting a 73 billion yen ($898.5
million) loss in the year ended March 31, wider than its
forecast of 26 billion yen, due to the reversal of deferred tax
assets, according to a preliminary earnings statement.  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. (9104) , Japan’s second-biggest shipper by
sales, lost 1.9 percent to 319 yen.  Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. (9107) 
dropped 4.6 percent to 165 yen.  IMF Firepower  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  fell 0.3 percent
today. The gauge gained 0.1 percent in  New York  on April 20 as
earnings from companies including Microsoft Corp. and General
Electric Co. beat estimates.  Japanese stocks rose earlier after pledges to increase the
International Monetary Fund’s firepower to $430 billion to fight
the European debt crisis were announced after Group of 20
finance ministers and central bankers met last week in
 Washington . The group said in a statement that downside risks
remain in the world economy and that volatility is high in part
because of pressures in Europe.  Fanuc Corp. fell on a report  China ’s manufacturing may
contract for a sixth month in April, according to the purchasing
managers’ index from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
today. Fanuc, a maker of robotics for mainland factories,
declined 1 percent to 14,530.  Mitsui Chemicals Explosion  Mitsui Chemicals Inc. dropped 4.1 percent to 232 yen after
an explosion at its industrial adhesives plant near Hiroshima
killed and employee and injured 22 others yesterday.  Among stocks that rose, Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.,  Japan ’s
biggest drugmaker by market value, advanced 2 percent to 3,505
yen. Japan’s health ministry plans to expand the insurance
coverage of cancer drugs and subsidize some costs, the Nikkei
newspaper reported without saying where it obtained the
information.  The Nikkei 225 Volatility Index increased 3.8 percent to
19.86, indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.7 percent on
the benchmark equity gauge over the next 30 days.  Shares on the Topix are  valued  at 0.99 times book value,
compared with 2.2 times for the S&P 500 and 1.4 times for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index. A number below one means that investors
can buy companies for less than the value of their assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
