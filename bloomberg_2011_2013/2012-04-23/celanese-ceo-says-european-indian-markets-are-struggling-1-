Celanese Corp. (CE) , the Dallas-based
maker of plastics used in autos, said demand for cars and other
industrial goods in  Europe  and  India  has dropped because those
markets “are struggling.”  Demand has fallen in Europe this year as the financial
crisis weighs on consumer sentiment, Mark Rohr, chairman and
chief executive officer of Celanese, said in a phone interview
today. Similar trends are evident in India, he said.  “Some of the strong legacy economies like Europe are
struggling, and some of the younger and emerging economies like
India are struggling,” Rohr said. “We are not sure exactly
what is going on in India.”  China demand is improving every month after a “horrible”
fourth quarter, he said. Asia and  Australia  accounted for 29
percent of Celanese’s revenue last year, with  41 percent  from
Europe and Africa, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Rohr, 60, said he wants to increase the company’s market
value by reducing earnings fluctuations and increasing sales.  The company is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings
tomorrow. Rohr took over as CEO of Celanese on April 2,
succeeding David Weidman, who retired.  To contact the reporter on this story:
