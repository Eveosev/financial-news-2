The  European Central Bank  said
financial institutions will have to provide additional
information on asset-backed securities they pledge as collateral
in exchange for loans.  The Governing Council decided last week that banks will
have to inform the region’s central banks, known as the
Eurosystem, “one month beforehand of any planned modification
to an ABS that it has submitted as collateral,” the ECB said on
its  website . Lenders will also have to inform the Eurosystem
“upon submission of an ABS, of any modification made to that
ABS in the six months prior to its submission, if the ABS is
‘own-used’.”  The ECB is trying to reduce the risk it has taken in
providing banks with more than 1 trillion euros ($1.3 trillion)
of cheap liquidity to avert a credit crunch and unlock financial
markets. The Frankfurt-based central bank last changed the rules
on the asset-backed securities it accepts in refinancing
operations in October, when it gave itself more discretionary
power to reject collateral if needed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
