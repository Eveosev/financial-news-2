U.S. corn, spring-wheat and
cotton planting are being planted faster than the previous
five-year averages after unusually warm March weather and
April rains left soil ready for fieldwork, the government
said.  About 28 percent of the corn crop, the world’s
biggest, was planted as of yesterday, up from 17 percent a
week earlier and 8 percent a year earlier, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said today in a  report . The
average was 15 percent at the end of the year’s 16th week
from 2007 to 2011.  “It’s been a fast start for the planting season,”
Lawrence Kane, a market adviser for the Stewart-Peterson
Group in West Bend,  Wisconsin , said in a telephone
interview. “Some farmers are already finished planting
corn and started seeding soybeans.”  The report was issued after the close of trading on
the  Chicago  Board of Trade, where corn futures for July
delivery rose 1.6 percent to close at $6.125 a bushel. The
most-active contract has dropped 4.9 percent this month on
speculation that rapid U.S. planting will boost yields.  Record Acreage Forecast  Farmers are expected to increase corn sowing by 4.3
percent to 95.864 million acres this year, the most since
1937, the USDA said on March 30, after surveying growers.  About 9 percent of corn had emerged from the ground as
of yesterday, up from 2 percent a year earlier, the USDA
said.  Farmers had sown 6 percent of the soybean crop as of
yesterday, compared with 2 percent a year earlier, the USDA
said. It is the second time since 1980 that the USDA
released a soybean planting estimate for the third week of
April.  About 57 percent of the spring-wheat  crop  was seeded
as of yesterday, up from 6 percent a year earlier, the
department said. The average for the date for the previous
five years is 19 percent.  The winter-wheat crop was in better shape than a year
earlier, as above-normal rains in parts of the southern
Great Plains offset declining conditions in parts of the
Midwest from wet, cold weather, Stewart-Peterson’s Kane
said.  An estimated 63 percent of the crop was in good or
excellent  condition , compared with 64 percent a week
earlier, the USDA said. During the same week last year, 35
percent had the top ratings.  Cotton planting  was 17 percent completed, compared
with 13 percent a week earlier and 13 percent on average
the prior five years, the USDA said. Rice  planting  in the
top six producing states was 65 percent completed, up from
56 percent a week earlier and 43 percent on average from
2007-2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
