National Water Co., Saudi Arabia’s
state-owned utility, plans to spend $66.4 billion on plants and
repairs over the next 10 years, said Osama Dardeer, senior
manager for corporate projects.  The spending plan includes wastewater facilities, an
airport water-treatment plant at the Red Sea port of  Jeddah  and
repairs to leaking pipes, he said today in a speech at a
conference in the eastern city of Khobar.  The company has a project in the Saudi capital of  Riyadh  to
generate 5 megawatts of electricity turning wastewater into
methane gas, Dardeer said. National Water plans to build a
similar plant in Jeddah to produce about 7.5 megawatts of power,
he said. It will announce bids soon for this plant and Dardeer
said the facility may be ready in two to three years.  The state-run utility has repaired leaks in Saudi Arabia’s
water transmission network, saving 67 million cubic meters of
water since 2008, Dardeer said. The value of water saved is
about 402 million riyals ($107 million), he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
