Oil options volatility was little
changed as the underlying futures fell after reports indicating
manufacturing is weakening in China and  Europe , raising concerns
that fuel demand will decline.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 24.21 at 3:35 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , compared with 24.47 on April 20. It was the
third straight decline.  “Volatility was up pretty good for a while, but oil held
above $102 and there was not a lot of option activity to really
affect anything,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of
Paramount Options Inc. in  New York .  Crude oil for June delivery fell 77 cents to settle at
$103.11 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after
touching $101.82. Crude has traded in a range of $100.68 to
$105.07 since April 4. Futures have declined 6.1 percent since
reaching a high of $109.77 on Feb. 24.  The most-active oil options in electronic trading today
were June $100 puts, which gained 3 cents to $1.41 a barrel at
3:44 p.m. with 2,729 contracts trading. June $95 puts were the
second-most active with 2,176 lots changing hands. They fell 2
cents to 49 cents.  Puts accounted for 58 percent of electronic trading volume.
