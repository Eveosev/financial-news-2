SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI) , the eighth-
largest U.S. lender by deposits, said first-quarter net income
rose 39 percent, beating analysts’ estimates, as mortgage income
rebounded.  Net income increased to $250 million, or 46 cents per
share, from $180 million, or 8 cents, in the year-earlier
period, the Atlanta-based bank said in a statement today.
Analysts had estimated the lender would post earnings per share
of 33 cents, according to 31 surveyed by Bloomberg.  Revenue climbed to $2.22 billion from $2.16 billion as
mortgage production income surged to $63 million from $1 million
in the first quarter last year, SunTrust said. SunTrust cut its
provisions for credit losses to $317 million in the period from
$447 million a year earlier.  “Improved revenue, as well as continued favorable trends
in loans, deposits, and credit metrics were hallmarks for the
quarter,” Chief Executive Officer William Rogers said today in
the statement.  SunTrust said last month it would have met Federal Reserve
standards for withstanding a severe economic slump without its
submitted plan for capital actions, which may have included
dividend increases or share buybacks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
