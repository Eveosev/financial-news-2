The White House counsel’s office
found no evidence of misconduct by members of the president’s
staff in  Colombia , where 12 members of the Secret Service
ensnared by a prostitution scandal,  Jay Carney , President Barack Obama’s spokesman, said.  There is “no indication” that members of the White House
advance team engaged in inappropriate behavior while in Colombia
preparing for Obama’s arrival at the Summit of the Americas,
Carney said today at a briefing.  The Secret Service and Congress are investigating an
incident involving agents who allegedly consorted with
prostitutes at their hotel in Cartagena, Colombia. Six members
of the Secret Service have been forced out. A separate
investigation is being conducted by the Defense Department.  To contact the reporters on this story:
