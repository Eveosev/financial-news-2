Mexico’s ruling party candidate
moved back into second place after her rival in third position
threatened to overtake her last week, according to the latest
poll ahead of the July 1 vote.  Josefina Vazquez Mota of President  Felipe Calderon ’s
National Action Party won 21.7 percent support and Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who narrowly lost to Calderon in the 2006
election, had 17.2 percent, Grupo Economistas Asociados-ISA said
last night in its daily poll.  Vazquez Mota had received 17.9 percent backing in the April
19 poll and Lopez Obrador had gained 19.3 percent.  Mexico’s leading presidential candidate, Enrique Pena Nieto
of the once-dominant  Institutional Revolutionary Party , won 36.7
percent support in the survey.  Gabriel Quadri de la Torre, of the New Alliance Party, had
0.9 percent support, and 23.5 percent of those polled remained
undecided, according to the study.  The poll included 1,152 people interviewed from April 20 to
April 22 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
