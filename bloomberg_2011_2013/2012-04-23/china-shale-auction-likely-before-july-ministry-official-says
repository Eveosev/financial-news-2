China will likely hold its second
auction of shale-gas exploration areas before July, an
official at the Ministry of Land and Resources said.  More than 100 Chinese companies have qualified to
participate in the auction, and the goverment will offer at least
20 areas, Zhang Jianfeng, a director at the ministryâ€™s research
institute, said in an interview in Beijing. Overseas companies
will remain barred from bidding directly and can invest in
ventures led by local explorers, he said.    To contact the reporter on this story:
