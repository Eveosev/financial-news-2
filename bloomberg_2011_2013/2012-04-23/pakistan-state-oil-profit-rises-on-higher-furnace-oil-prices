Pakistan State Oil Co. (PSO) , the
nation’s biggest fuel retailer, said third-quarter profit
doubled after gains in furnace oil prices.  Net income rose to 4.4 billion rupees ($48.4 million), or
25.60 rupees a share, in the three months ended March 31, from
2.1 billion rupees, or 12.40 rupees, a year earlier, the
Karachi-based company said in a statement to the  Karachi Stock
Exchange  today. Sales rose 22 percent to 286.6 billion rupees.  “The price of furnace oil rose 26 percent compared to the
same quarter last year,” Sana Abdullah, a research analyst for
IGI Finex Securities Ltd., who has a buy recommendation on the
stock, said before the earnings announcement. “The margins on
high-speed diesel and petrol also increased.”  Furnace oil accounts for 56 percent of the company’s gross
profit, while high-speed diesel and gasoline contribute 30
percent and 13 percent, respectively, Abdullah said.  Pakistan State Oil  shares  rose 2.4 percent, the most since
Feb. 7, to 252.75 rupees at the close on the Karachi Stock
Exchange. The stock has gained 11 percent this year.  The company plans to pay a midyear cash dividend of 3
rupees a share, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
