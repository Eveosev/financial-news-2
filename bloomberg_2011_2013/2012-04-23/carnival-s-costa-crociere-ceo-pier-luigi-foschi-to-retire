Carnival Corp. (CCL) ’s Costa Crociere
unit, owner of the Concordia cruise ship that ran aground in
January, killing at least 25 people, said chief executive
officer Pier Luigi Foschi will retire effective July 1.  Michael Thamm, president of Germany-based AIDA Cruises,
will succeed Foschi, Miami-based Carnival said today in a
statement. Foschi, 65, will remain chairman and managing
director of the unit and a director of the parent company.  The change is part of a long-term  succession plan  that
included the scheduled retirement of Foschi at age 65, Carnival
said in the statement. He will continue to oversee government
relations for Costa, including matters related to the Costa
Concordia accident.  Thamm will relocate to Genoa,  Italy , and serve as CEO of
the Costa group, which includes AIDA and Spanish ship operator
Ibero Cruises.  Carnival, the world’s largest cruise ship operator, awarded
the job of removing the Costa Concordia wreckage to Titan
Salvage and Micoperi. The operation will begin next month and is
expected to take a year, the company said.  Carnival  fell  1.2 percent $31.31 at 12:59 p.m. in New York.
The shares had declined 2.9 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
