New Zealand central bank Governor
Alan Bollard should keep the official cash rate at a record-low
2.5 percent this week, according to the shadow board set up by
the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research Inc.  Seven of the boardâ€™s nine members said no change was the
most appropriate decision while two prefer a rate cut, according
to an e-mailed statement today. Bollard, a former director of
the NZIER, announces his decision in Wellington on April 26.  Bollard has kept the  cash rate  at 2.5 percent since March
last year as the economic recovery has been hampered by weak
global demand while a rising currency curbs inflation. All 16
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast no rate change
this week, with just two expecting an increase before September.  The board comprising academics, economists and business
executives is a pilot run by the Wellington-based institute to
encourage debate on each rate decision. The participants
indicate where they think rates should be not what they expect
will happen, the institute said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
