The following companies had unusual
price changes in Mexico trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the close of trading.  The IPC index fell 1 percent to 38,961.79.  Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB  (WALMEXV MM),  Latin America ’s
largest retailer, slumped 12 percent to 37.89 pesos. Walmex fell
the most since 1998 after its parent company announced an
investigation into allegations that representatives in the
country bribed local officials to get stores opened faster. The
investigation following a story in The  New York  Times yesterday
may slow Wal-Mart’s growth in Mexican authorities give its
permits more scrutiny, Robert Carroll, an analyst at UBS AG in
New York, said today in a report.  Walmex doesn’t believe corruption allegations against the
company will adversely affect its earnings and cash flow, it
said today in a statement.  Grupo Modelo SAB (GMODELOC)  , the brewer of Corona beer,
climbed 1.9 percent to 95.17 pesos after saying first-quarter
profit rose 5.4 percent as higher prices and sales volumes
countered an increase in the effective  tax rate . Net income
climbed to 2.3 billion pesos ($174.3 million) from 2.1 billion
pesos a year earlier, the Mexico City-based company said today
in a statement to the Mexican stock exchange.  Organizacion Soriana SAB (SORIANAB)  , a Mexican grocery
store chain, increased 2.4 percent to 38.82 pesos. A government
report showed Mexican retail sales rose 7.6 percent in February
from the same month last year, exceeding the 4.8 percent median
estimate of 14 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Controladora Comercial Mexicana SAB (COMERUBC)  , a
Mexican supermarket chain known as Comerci, gained 1.8 percent
to 27.84 pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
