 Baltika AS, the third-biggest listed
Baltic clothing company, rose the most in eight months after
sales grew in October for the first time since July.  The stock rose 8 percent to a four-week high of 0.635 euro
in  Estonia ’s capital, Tallinn, where the retailer is based.
Volume of 40,617 shares was more than double the three-month
daily average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales at Baltika’s 121 stores in the three Baltic
countries, Ukraine and Russia increased 6 percent in October
from a year earlier to 5.48 million euros ($7.4 million), the
company said today in a statement. The shares fell more than 15
percent over the previous month after Baltika cut this year’s
profit target by half, citing slower third-quarter sales.  The fashion retailer has faced “intensified competition”
in recent months as chains including  Sweden ’s  H&M (HMB)  and
 Lithuania ’s Apranga expand in the Baltic region, Swedbank
analyst Maart Kroodo said in a report last month. Warmer weather
in the region probably also delayed purchases of items in
Baltika’s fall collection, he said.  Swedbank on Oct. 3 lowered its price target for Baltika to
0.55 euro, from 0.642 euro on Sept. 5, and kept its sell
recommendation for the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
