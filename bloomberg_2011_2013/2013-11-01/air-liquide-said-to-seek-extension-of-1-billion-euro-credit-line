Air Liquide SA (AI) , the French maker of
industrial gases, is seeking to extend the maturity of a 1
billion-euro ($1.4 billion)  credit line  three years before its
maturity, according to three people with knowledge of the
request.  The company has asked lenders for a five-year extension of
the facility, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the discussions are private. The Paris-based firm is
offering to pay an interest margin of 25 basis points, or 0.25
percentage point, more than benchmark rates, 20 basis points
lower than it paid on the existing debt.  Air Liquide joins Electricite de France SA and Pernod
Ricard SA in seeking to capitalize on competition among banks
keen to lend to the most creditworthy companies. The interest
margin paid by  Europe â€™s investment-grade borrowers fell to an
average of 61 basis points this year, the lowest since an
average 75 basis points paid in 2007, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  A spokeswoman for Air Liquide, who asked not to be named
citing company policy, declined to comment on the financing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
