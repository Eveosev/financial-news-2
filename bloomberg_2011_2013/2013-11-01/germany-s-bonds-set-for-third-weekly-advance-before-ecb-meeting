Italy’s government bonds rose, with
10-year yields falling to the lowest level since June, amid
speculation the  European Central Bank  will cut  interest rates  as
soon as its meeting next week.  Spain ’s securities advanced for a second day as Bank of
America Corp., UBS AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc all
forecast that policy makers will lower borrowing costs this
month after data yesterday showed inflation slowed to the least
since 2009. Greek  10-year yields  dropped below 8 percent for the
first time since June 2010 amid bets the ECB led by President
 Mario Draghi  will conduct a further longer-term refinancing
operation to help revive growth.  “The inflation data does increase a prospect of a rate cut
and another round of LTRO,” said  Steven Major , global head of
fixed-income research at HSBC Holdings Plc in London. “We are
likely to get both although it may not happen next week. If the
ECB moves at the November meeting, it would appear a bit hasty
and Draghi may have to backtrack a bit on some of what the ECB
said about the recovery.”  Italy’s  10-year yield  fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 4.09 percent at 4:49 p.m. London time after
dropping to 4.08 percent, the lowest level since May 29. The 4.5
percent bond due in March 2024 rose 0.37, or 3.70 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,349) face amount, to 103.795.  Spanish 10-year yields declined five basis points to 3.98,
the least since May 3.  Two-year rates  fell 10 basis points to
1.42 percent, having dropped 22 basis points this week.  Record Low  Spain’s bonds extended gains after  Fitch Ratings  revised
the nation’s outlook to stable from negative and affirmed its
rating at BBB.  Bank of America, UBS and RBS all predict the ECB will cut
its main refinancing rate by 25 basis points on Nov. 7. BNP
Paribas SA, Societe Generale SA, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and
Scotiabank forecast a reduction in December, when the central
bank will publish new economic projections. The ECB last lowered
its  benchmark rate  on May 2 to a record 0.5 percent.  Since taking over as head of the Frankfurt-based ECB in
November 2011, Draghi has cut the refinancing rate, flooded the
banking system with more than 1 trillion euros of three-year
loans and pledged in July 2012 to do “whatever it takes” to
safeguard the single currency.  “There’s a good chance of a rate cut next week,” said
Peter Osler, head of interest-rate strategy at broker Marex
Spectron Group Ltd. in  London . “It comes down to the
deflationary trends which I think are building. Shorter-dated
bonds are likely to outperformed longer maturities.”  Rate Outlook  The implied yield on Euribor contracts expiring in December
2014, a measure of the outlook for three-month money-market
rates, dropped as much as five basis points to 0.355 percent,
the lowest since May 23.  Greece ’s 10-year yield fell as much as 18 basis points to
7.90 percent, the lowest since June 2, 2010. The  rate surged  to
44.21 percent in March 2012 as the government forced losses on
investors as part of a debt swap that saw it issue new
securities at less than 30 percent of face amount.  German benchmark 10-year yields rose two basis points to
1.69 percent.  Two-year rates  were little changed at 0.11 percent
after declining to 0.087 percent, the lowest level since July
22.  Euro-area inflation unexpectedly slowed to 0.7 percent in
October, the ninth straight month it has been less than the
ECB’s 2 percent ceiling, European Union data showed yesterday. A
separate report yesterday showed unemployment climbed to a
record 12.2 percent in September.  Belgian Yields  Volatility on Dutch bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by those of Spain and  France , according
to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and
10-year securities and credit-default swaps.  Belgian  two-year yields  dropped one basis point to 0.26
percent, having fallen seven basis points this week. Similar-maturity  French rates  also declined one basis point, to 0.28
percent, having slid 10 basis points since Oct. 25.  Italy’s bonds returned 6.5 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Spain’s
returned 11 percent, while  Germany ’s lost 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
