Oil delivered by rail to  California ,
the world’s ninth-largest economy, tumbled 29 percent in the
third quarter as shipments from  Canada  were halted and
deliveries from states including  North Dakota  dropped.  The most populous U.S. state received 531,766 barrels of
crude in rail-cars from July through September, down from
748,802 barrels in the prior three months, data posted on the
state Energy Commission’s  website  show. Rail imports from Canada
dropped to zero after totaling 76,648 barrels a quarter earlier.
North Dakota, where fields in the Bakken formation are producing
a record volume of crude, cut rail deliveries by 17 percent.  Third-quarter rail shipments were up 9.5 percent from a
year ago as West Coast refiners, facing declining supplies from
California and  Alaska , build rail offloading terminals to reach
a glut of oil being extracted from shale formations in the
middle of the country. Alaska  supplied  12 percent of
California’s oil in 2012, down from 22 percent a decade ago,
according to the state Energy Commission.  Oil-by-rail receipts to California from  Colorado  fell to
142,939 barrels in the third quarter, down from 225,201 in the
three months ended June. North Dakota shipments totaled 263,072
barrels.  New Mexico  sent 108,999 barrels to state, slipping from
104,855 in the second quarter.  Oil produced in Alaska’s North Slope is set to become an
“advantaged crude,” meaning it will sell at a discount to oils
priced against North Sea Brent, as cheaper, domestic oil makes
its way to the West,  Phillips 66 (PSX)  Chief Executive Officer Greg Garland said on a conference call Oct. 30 with analysts and
investors.  Alaskan Decline  Alaskan oil output  has declined every year since 2002 as
the yield from existing wells shrinks. Alaska North Slope crude
production averaged 534,306 barrels a day in  October , down from
572,589  a year earlier , data posted on the Alaska Department of
Revenue’s website today showed.  “The actions we’re taking, the actions others are taking,
put pressure on some of these crudes,” Garland said on the
call. “And so I think we do get 100 percent advantaged crude
over the next couple of years.”  ANS stockpiles at the Valdez Marine Terminal, the delivery
point of the Trans Alaskan Pipeline System, known as TAPS, rose
5.9 percent to 3.13 million barrels last month from the same
period in 2012, the state website shows.  The  premium  for ANS versus the U.S. benchmark West Texas
Intermediate crude shrank $1 to $7.75 a barrel at 4:16 p.m.  New
York  time, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The spread has
narrowed by more than half since the beginning of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
