Crude options volatility rose as the
underlying futures slipped below $95 a barrel for the first time
since June.  Implied volatility for at-the-money December options, a
measure of expected futures swings and a key gauge of value, was
19.96 percent at 4:25 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
up from 19.11 percent yesterday. Puts protecting against a 10
percent drop in prices increased to 28.43 percent compared with
27.63 in the prior session.  West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery
declined $1.77, or 1.8 percent, to $94.61 on the Nymex, the
lowest settlement since June. 21. Futures sank amid surging
stockpiles and a stronger dollar versus the euro.  “The weaker euro was the trigger,” said  Tim Evans , an
energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in  New York . “But
the real underlying fundamental weakness is in the U.S. crude
market, where inventories have risen nearly 8 percent in the
last six weeks.”  Puts, or bets that prices would fall, accounted for eight
of the nine most-popular options and 59 percent of electronic
trading volume today.  The most-active options were December $90 puts, which rose
13 cents to 30 cents a barrel with 5,233 lots trading as of 4:30
p.m. December $100 calls declined 18 cents to 11 cents on volume
of 4,703 lots.  In the previous session, puts accounted for 57 percent of
the 106,196 lots traded. December $95 puts rose 1 cent to 95
cents a barrel with 6,140 contracts trading. December $100 calls
fell 15 cents to 29 cents on volume of 4,560 lots.  Open interest in the prior session was highest for December
$80 puts, with 42,812 contracts. Next were December $90 puts
with 42,563 lots and December $85 puts with 35,831.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
