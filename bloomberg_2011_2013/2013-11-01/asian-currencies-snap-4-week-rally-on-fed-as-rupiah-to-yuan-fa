Asian currencies ended a four-week
advance as U.S. economic data fueled speculation the  Federal
Reserve  will taper its stimulus sooner than economists expected.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index slumped by the
most in more than two months as China’s yuan had its worst five-day drop in more than a year. Malaysia’s ringgit,  Thailand ’s
baht and the Philippine peso fell by the most in a month and
India’s rupee posted a third weekly decline.  Global funds pulled money out of equities in  Indonesia ,
Thailand and the  Philippines  and cut buying of Indian stocks.
The  Federal Open Market Committee  maintained its $85 billion in
monthly bond purchases on Oct. 30, noting the world’s largest
economy is showing signs of “underlying strength.” U.S. data
released Oct. 31 showed a drop in jobless claims, while a gauge
of business activity jumped the most in three decades.  “Speculation on the timing of the FOMC’s tapering has
increased after the Fed’s positive tone on the economy,” said
Hong Seok Chan, a currency analyst at Daishin Economy Research
Institute in Seoul. “Foreign fund flows into equities have
slowed.”  The Asia Dollar Index lost 0.4 percent after gaining 1.2
percent in the preceding four weeks. The rupiah slumped 2.8
percent in the five days to 11,334 per dollar and the  yuan ,
which touched a 20-year high on Oct. 25, retreated 0.25 percent
to 6.0995. The rupee weakened 0.4 percent to 61.73 and the
ringgit fell 0.4 percent to 3.1707.  Tapering Bets  Economists at Citigroup Inc. and Barclays Plc said the
Fed’s policy statement opens the possibility of a reduction in
bond purchases as soon as December. The odds of tapering in
January rose to 45 percent, from 25 percent before the FOMC
decision, according to Citigroup. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg Oct. 17-18 had predicted the Fed would begin paring
stimulus in March.  Jobless claims decreased by 10,000 to 340,000 in the week
ended Oct. 26 from 350,000 in the prior period, the Labor
Department reported Oct. 31 in  Washington . The median forecast
of 49 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a decrease to
338,000. The MNI Chicago Report business barometer climbed to
65.9 in October from 55.7 in September.  The  Taiwan dollar  slipped 0.1 percent against the greenback
for the week to NT$29.47. The island’s central bank intervened
to prevent its currency from gaining beyond NT$29.40, the
Economic Daily reported yesterday, citing unnamed traders.  South Korea’s won was 0.1 percent stronger for the week at
1,060.80 per dollar, and has gained 5.8 percent in the past
three months. The currency touched a two-week low of 1,065.45
yesterday. The government will take steps to curb “herd
behavior” in the  currency market , Finance Minister Hyun Oh Seok
said in Seoul on Oct. 31.  Thailand’s baht weakened 0.6 percent to 31.20 per dollar,
halting two weeks of gains. The Southeast Asian nation’s lower
house passed a bill granting amnesty for political offenses
yesterday, stoking street protests. Elsewhere, the  Philippine
peso  declined 0.4 percent to 43.215 and Vietnam’s dong was
little changed at 21,095 per dollar.  To contact the reporters on this story:
