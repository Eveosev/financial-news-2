Billionaire hedge-fund manager  Steven A. Cohen  is selling artworks from his collection during the big,
semi-annual auctions in New York this month.  Most of the sales will be at  Sotheby’s (BID)  contemporary-art
evening sale on Nov. 13, according to a person familiar with the
matter. Cohen’s works by  Andy Warhol ,  Gerhard Richter , Brice
Marden,  Cy Twombly  and Joan Mitchell have been estimated at as
much as $85 million, or 20 percent of the $424.6 million
auction.  Christie’s has “minor” works from Cohen’s collection,
estimated at less than $5 million, according to  Brett Gorvy ,
chairman and international head of postwar and contemporary art
at Christie’s.  Cohen regularly buys and sells at auction. The current
group is hitting the market when his firm, SAC Capital Advisors
LP, is accused in a grand-jury indictment of encouraging insider
trading. The company was told it would have to pay $1.8 billion
and admit wrongdoing to resolve securities-fraud charges. That
includes a previous penalty of about $600 million.  Warhol’s 1963 “Liz #1 (Early Colored Liz)” leads the
Sotheby’s group, for an estimated $20 million to $30 million.
The 40-inch-square canvas depicts  Elizabeth Taylor ’s face on an
acid-yellow background.  Richter’s 1986 abstract painting “A.B. Courbet” is
estimated at $15 million to $20 million. The 10-by-8-foot canvas
was last shown publicly on the Pace Gallery stand at the Art
Basel fair in 2012. Its asking price was between $20 million and
$25 million.  Warhol Deaths  Warhol’s 1963 square canvas “5 Deaths on Turquoise” is
valued at $7 million to $10 million. Like “Liz #1” it had
belonged to the late art dealer Ileana Sonnabend.  Marden’s 7-foot-tall painting “The Attended” was also
estimated at $7 million to $10 million. Painted in 1996-99, it
depicts snaking lines in red, green, white and yellow on gray
background. Cohen bought the painting from Matthew Marks Gallery
in New York  Joan Mitchell ’s 1960-61 abstract painting “Atlantic Side”
is expected to bring $5 million to $7 million. Cohen bought the
work at Christie’s for $5.1 million in 2007, during the last
art-market boom.  Rudolf Stingel’s 11-foot-tall, black-and-white self-portrait as a young man is estimated at $3 million to $5
million. The 2010 painting was acquired from Gagosian Gallery
where it was on view in 2011.  Cy Twombly’s 2009 bronze sculpture “Untitled (The
Mathematical Dream of Ashurbanipal)” is estimated at $2 million
to $3 million. Cohen purchased it from Thomas Ammann Fine Art
gallery in Zurich.  All of these Sotheby’s works, except for the Mitchell
painting, have been guaranteed, according to the catalog.  Muse highlights include  Greg Evans and Craig Seligman  on
movies,  Zinta Lundborg  on NYC Weekend.  To contact the reporters of this story:
