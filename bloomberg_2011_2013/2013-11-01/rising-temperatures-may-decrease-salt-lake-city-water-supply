The annual flow of streams supplying
water to  Salt Lake City ,  Utah , may decline by an average of 3.8
percent for every degree Fahrenheit of warming in the region,
according to research published in the Earth Interactions
journal.  Warmer temperatures may cause more of the region’s
precipitation to fall as rain rather than snow, which leads to
earlier runoff and less water in creeks, according to the report
authored by experts from the Cooperative Institute for Research
in Environmental Sciences, the National Center for Atmospheric
Research and other organizations.  “We are using the findings of this sensitivity analysis to
better understand the range of impacts we might experience under
climate change scenarios,” Laura Briefer, a co-author of the
study and water manager at the Salt Lake City Department of
Public Utilities, said in a statement today.  Temperatures in northern Utah have already risen about 2
degrees Fahrenheit in the last century, the report showed. A 5
degree increase in temperature would need to be offset by a 10
percent annual increase in precipitation, the study said.  The research team also included experts from the University
of Utah and the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration ’s Earth System Research Laboratory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
