CTBC Financial Holding Co. (2891)  fell in
Taipei trading after announcing the acquisition of  Taiwan Life
Insurance Co. (2833)  and  Japan ’s Tokyo Star Bank Ltd. for about $1.4
billion as it seeks to diversify and expand abroad.  Shares in the island’s fourth-largest financial firm by
market value fell 2.5 percent to a one-month low of NT$19.40 at
11:15 a.m. Taiwan Life rose 1.2 percent to NT$26.40, while the
benchmark Taiex index slipped 0.5 percent. Tokyo Star isn’t
publicly traded.  At about two times the insurer’s book value, the NT$26.6
billion ($904 million) acquisition is expensive compared with
similar deals, according to Fan Wen-Yen, a banking analyst at
KGI Securities in Taipei. The purchase of the first life insurer
established in  Taiwan  will give CTBC access to 870,000 clients
on the island of 23 million people.  “TLI may have a legacy book with high liability costs as
it has been in operations since 1947, so this deal could expose
CTBC to greater earnings/book value volatility,” Vincent Chang,
an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., wrote in a note. The
purchase will allow the firm to develop new products,
“strengthening its leadership in  wealth management ,” he wrote.  The valuation of the all-share purchase of 100 percent of
Taiwan Life, given by CTBC yesterday, is based on a reference
share price of NT$19 for the acquirer. CTBC also agreed to buy
98 percent of Tokyo Star Bank Ltd. for 52 billion yen ($529
million) in cash.  “Getting a life insurance business could dilute what CTBC
is good at” because returns may be lower,  Jerry Yang , an
analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets Hong Kong Ltd., said by
telephone. “Global investors generally prefer pure insurers or
pure banks, it’s better not growing their life arm too big.”  In buying the Japanese lender, CTBC Financial follows
competitors in expanding outside a home market where competition
has squeezed lending margins to the second-lowest in Asia
Pacific.  Bloomberg News  reported the planned acquisition in
July, with two people with knowledge of the matter saying it’s
the first takeover of a Japanese commercial lender by a foreign
bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
