Malaysia’s ringgit dropped the most
in a month after a jump in U.S. business activity spurred
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will start trimming its stimulus
earlier than predicted.  Government bonds  retreated.  The MNI Chicago Report  business barometer  climbed to 65.9
in October from 55.7 in September, data showed yesterday. That
was the biggest increase in more than three decades and exceeded
the median estimate of 55 in a Bloomberg survey. The ringgit may
weaken should the Fed decide to reduce its debt purchases this
year, Saktiandi Supaat, head of foreign-exchange research at
Malayan Banking Bhd. in  Singapore , said in an interview.  “The strong Chicago PMI boosted the dollar,” said  Nizam
Idris , head of strategy for fixed income and currencies at
Macquarie Bank Ltd. in Singapore. “The Chicago PMI renewed
expectations that the Fed could still taper in December.”  The ringgit depreciated 0.7 percent, the biggest drop since
Sept. 30, to 3.1770 per dollar as of 10:33 a.m. in  Kuala Lumpur ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency declined
0.6 percent this week. It gained 3.3 percent in October, the
best performance among more than 100 global currencies tracked
by Bloomberg.  The Fed maintained its $85 billion monthly bond-buying
program this week, while noting signs of “underlying strength
in the broader economy.” Policy makers will hold off from
trimming the debt purchases until March, according to analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg Oct. 17-18. A reduction was earlier
forecast for December in a similar survey a month before.  Bond Holdings  The ringgit trimmed the day’s losses after a report showed
Chinese manufacturing expanded more than economists forecast in
October, Maybank’s Saktiandi said today. The currency fell as
much as 1 percent earlier to 3.1879 per dollar, the weakest
level since Oct. 22.  The  Purchasing Managers ’ Index was at 51.4, the National
Bureau of Statistics and China Federation of Logistics and
Purchasing said today in Beijing. That compares with 51.1 in
September and the 51.2 median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. A
separate manufacturing gauge from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics rose to 50.9 from 50.2.  Maybank raised its year-end forecast for the ringgit to
3.15 per dollar from 3.20, after the government announced
measures in last week’s budget to cut the fiscal deficit,
according to a research note yesterday, written by analysts
including Saktiandi.  Overseas investors  boosted holdings of Malaysian government
debt by 7.6 percent to 228.6 billion ringgit ($72 billion) in
September from a month earlier, after three straight months of
declines, central bank data showed yesterday.  One-month implied volatility in the ringgit, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose
38 basis points to 7.73 percent. The rate fell 59 basis points,
or 0.59 percentage point, this week.  The yield on the government’s 3.172 percent notes due July
