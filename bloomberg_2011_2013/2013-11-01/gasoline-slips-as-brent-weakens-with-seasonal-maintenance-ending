Gasoline and diesel fell as Brent
tumbled and seasonal maintenance in the U.S. was poised to taper
over the next few weeks.  Futures slipped as reports that  Libya  was producing more
oil sent  Brent crude  lower. The U.S. fall maintenance season
typically peaks in October and  refiners  begin bringing units
back just as gasoline demand may weaken in colder weather.  “Indications that more Libyan oil may return to the market
in the next two weeks is pressuring Brent and taking gasoline
and diesel fuel down with it,” said  Andy Lipow , president of
Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston. “The market is also
looking ahead over next few weeks as refiners return from
maintenance in the U.S. Gulf Coast.”  Gasoline for December delivery fell 2.54 cents, or 1
percent, to $2.5616 a gallon at 9:30 a.m. on the  New York

0.1 cent.  Brent for December delivery on the ICE Futures Europe

Ibrahim Al Awami, the oil ministry’s head of measurement and
inspection, said by phone yesterday, or about 100,000 barrels a
day more than earlier this week.  Maintenance Ends  Phillips 66 (PSX)  said yesterday that it completed maintenance at
its 146,000-barrel-a-day Borger, Texas,  refinery . Delta Air
Lines Inc.’s Monroe Energy LLC subsidiary said yesterday that it
was operating the fluid catalytic cracker at its 185,000-barrel-a-day Trainer,  Pennsylvania ,  plant  after unplanned repairs.  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude narrowed 21 cents to $12.06 a barrel. The
