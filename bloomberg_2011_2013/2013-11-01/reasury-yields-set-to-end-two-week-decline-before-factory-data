Treasury 10-year note  yields (USGG10YR)  rose to
the highest levels in three weeks after a gauge of U.S.
manufacturing expanded at a faster pace than forecast, weakening
the case for the  Federal Reserve  to maintain stimulus.  The benchmark  securities  extended the first five-day drop
in three weeks as Fed Bank of  St. Louis  President  James Bullard 
said labor market gains in the past year could warrant a cut in
the bond buying. Fed policy makers said Oct. 30 that the economy
showed signs of “underlying strength” even as they maintained
their $85 billion of monthly asset purchases.  “The Institute for Supply Management factory data was a
little on the strong side, so it puts the tapering fear back
into the market and we start to get higher yields,” said
 William Larkin , a fixed-income portfolio manager at Cabot Money
Management in Salem,  Massachusetts , in a telephone interview.
“It’s become a Fed-centric environment.”  The 10-year  yield  rose seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 2.62 percent at 5 p.m.  New York  time,
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices showed, after touching 2.63
percent, the highest since Oct. 17. The 2.5 percent note due
August 2023 fell 1/2, or $5 per $1,000 face amount, to 98 31/32.  Yields have risen 11 basis points since Oct. 25 after
dropping 18 basis points in the preceding two weeks.  Gross’s Advice  “Stay at the front end of the yield curve,”  Bill Gross ,
co-founder of Pacific Investment Management Co. and manager of
the world’s biggest bond mutual fund, wrote today in a comment
on Twitter. “Taper may come but policy rate hike is another
matter.”  The Fed has kept the  target rate  at zero to 0.25 percent
since December 2008. Policy makers said this week they will
continue to divide their monthly  purchases  between $40 billion
of mortgage bonds and $45 billion in  Treasury securities  as they
await more evidence of a strengthening economy.  “Two key labor market indicators have shown clear
improvement over the last year: Unemployment and nonfarm payroll
employment,” Bullard said today in St. Louis. “This provides
the most powerful part of the case for tapering.”  The  unemployment rate  has dropped to 7.2 percent from 7.8
percent in September 2012, while nonfarm payroll gains have
averaged 185,420 a month after over the past year after an
average of 130,000 in the preceding six months.  A Bloomberg survey of analysts taken on Oct. 17-18 forecast
a tapering of the purchases in March, later than previous polls
indicated as the government’s 16-day closure dented expectations
for economic growth. The  Federal Open Market Committee   next
meets  Dec. 17-18.  April Tapering  “We’ve been in the April camp,” said Jacob Oubina, senior
economist at RBC Capital Markets LLC in New York. “About 65
percent of the data has disappointed relative to consensus. We
don’t think the Fed engages in tapering in 2013 and there’s not
enough time to see a robust trend in the jobs data for them to
consider tapering in January.”  The  U.S. economy  will probably expand at a 2 percent
annualized rate in the final three months of the year, less than
economists projected at the start of the budget impasse that
resulted in a 16-day government shutdown.  The median projection of 71 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg yesterday compares with a 2.4 percent forecast in an
Oct. 4-9 survey. Gross domestic product, the sum of all goods
and services produced in the nation, will accelerate to a 2.6
percent growth rate in the first three months of 2014, unchanged
from the previous survey, economists said.  Treasuries gained 0.5 percent last month, cutting their
decline this year to 1.9 percent, according to Bloomberg World
Bond Indexes.  Business Barometer  U.S. government debt extended declines today after the ISM
factory index rose to 56.4 in October, the highest since April
2011, from 56.2 a month earlier, the Tempe, Arizona-based
group’s report showed. Readings above 50 indicate growth. The
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists was 55.  Yields rose yesterday after the MNI  Chicago Report (CHPMINDX)  business
barometer climbed to 65.9 in October from 55.7 a month earlier,
the fastest pace since March 2011. Readings above 50 signal
expansion.  “The correlation between the Chicago PMI and ISM is
strong,” said  Sean Murphy , a trader in New York at Societe
Generale SA, one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed.
“We may see a better buying opportunity if the 10-year gets to
2.61-2.62 percent.”  A report from the Commerce Department on Nov. 4 will show
that orders placed with U.S. factories increased 1.8 percent in
September from a month earlier, according to a separate survey
of economists. The August figure will also be released after
being postponed last month because of a partial government
shutdown.  Dealer Reductions  Primary dealers reduced their holdings of Treasuries by the
most in 14 months for the five-day period ended Oct. 23,
according to Bloomberg data. The dealers cut their holdings by
$37.7 billion or 25.8 percent to $108.3 billion, the biggest
reduction since the period ended Aug. 1, 2012.  The average weekly volume for primary dealer trading of
 U.S. government debt  in October dropped to $531.87 billion from
$576.6 billion the previous month, according to Fed data. It
touched a 2013 high of $668.3 billion in June and a low of $481
billion in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
