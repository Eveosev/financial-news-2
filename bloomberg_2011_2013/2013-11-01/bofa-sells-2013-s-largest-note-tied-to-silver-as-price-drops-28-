Bank of America Corp.  sold $15.3
million of one-year notes tied to the spot price of silver, this
year’s largest such offering tied to the most volatile metal.  The securities, issued Oct. 29, yield 22 percent at
maturity if they aren’t automatically called after six or nine
months, which occurs when the commodity’s value rises, according
to a prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. The bank estimated their initial value as 97.2 cents
on the dollar, according to the prospectus.  One month at-the-money implied volatility for silver
futures was 28.81 today, the highest of any metal, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Slow industrial growth in  China , which is a major buyer of
the commodity, led to a decrease in the precious metal’s value,
said Michael Gayed, co-portfolio manager of the ATAC Inflation
Rotation Fund in  New York . The price of silver in  London  fell 28
percent this year to $21.88 a troy ounce.  Growth in China’s yearly gross domestic product has
 declined  to 7.8 percent in the third quarter from 7.9 percent at
the end of 2012, according to data from the National Bureau of
Statistics of China.  Investors have bought $20.8 million of notes tied to silver
this year, down 64 percent from the same period of 2012,
Bloomberg data show.  Susan McCabe, a spokeswoman for Bank of America, didn’t
return an e-mail seeking comment on the notes.  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts with
values derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in  interest rates  or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
