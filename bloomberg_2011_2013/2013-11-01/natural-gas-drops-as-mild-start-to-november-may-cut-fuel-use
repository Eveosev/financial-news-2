Natural gas futures fell in  New York ,
heading for a third weekly loss, as the outlook for a mild start
to November signaled reduced heating-fuel demand.  Gas slid as much as 2 percent as forecasters including MDA
Weather Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , predicted seasonal
or above-normal temperatures in the eastern U.S. through Nov.
15. Gas  inventory gains  have topped five-year averages in five
of the past six weekly government reports as mild weather
limited demand.  “The next six to 10 days look a little above normal in the
gas-consuming region,” said Tom Saal, senior vice president of
energy trading at FCStone Latin America LLC in Miami. “As the
weather stays moderate, we will probably grind down.”  Natural gas for December delivery fell 6 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $3.521 per million British thermal units at 10:43
a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 27
percent above the 100-day average. Gas has declined 5 percent
this week and advanced 5.1 percent this year.  The discount of December to January futures, the most
actively traded gas spread, narrowed 0.2 cent to 8 cents from
9.1 cents yesterday. March gas traded 1.8 cents above the April
contract, compared with 2.3 cents yesterday.  December $3.50 puts were the most active options in
electronic trading. They were up 2.8 cents at 10.4 cents per
million Btu on volume of 1,170 at 10:48 a.m. Putts accounted for
65 percent of trading volume. Implied volatility for December
at-the-money options was 31.95 percent at 10:45 a.m., compared
with 30.35 percent yesterday.  Washington Temperatures  The low in  Washington  on Nov. 6 may be 59 degrees
Fahrenheit (15 Celsius), 15 above average, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in State College  Pennsylvania . Louisville,
 Kentucky , may be 1 higher than the usual reading at 44 degrees.  About 49 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
according to the Energy Information Administration, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm.  Gas demand during the first half of this month “will
likely be below normal and thus the weekly inventory injections
over the same time frame will likely outperform the historical
data,” Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy
Management Institute in New York, said in a note to clients
today.  “There will be an ample amount of nat gas available this
winter, thus reducing the likelihood of any major price spikes
during the heating season,” he said.  Marcellus Pipeline  Spectra Energy Corp. began service with a new gas pipeline
today, adding 800 million cubic feet of daily capacity to  New
Jersey  and  New York City , according to an e-mailed statement.
The $1.2 billion project added 16 miles of pipeline connecting
to the Leidy hub, a delivery point for the Marcellus shale in
Pennsylvania, and expands Spectra’s Texas Eastern Transmission
and Algonquin Gas Transmission Systems.  Gas inventories in the consuming East region rose by 17
billion cubic feet last week to 1.965 trillion, 5.8 percent
below year-earlier levels, the EIA said in a report yesterday.  Total stockpiles  across the lower 48 states expanded 38
billion to 3.779 trillion, EIA data show. The normal gain for
the week ended Oct. 25 was 57 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
