Cia. de Saneamento Basico do Estado
de Sao Paulo,  Brazil ’s biggest water utility, was authorized to
increase rates for water and sewage services by 3.14 percent.  The increase, which will be effective Dec. 11, was
calculated considering annual inflation through July, an
efficiency rate and a 2.35 percent adjustment that was granted
in April to Sabesp, as the company is known, Arsesp, the Sao
Paulo state’s water and energy regulator, said in an e-mailed
statement.  Sabesp, based in the city of Sao Paulo, serves 27.7 million
people in the southeastern Brazilian state, according to the
company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
