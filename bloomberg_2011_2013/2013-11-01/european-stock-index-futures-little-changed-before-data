European stocks  dropped, paring a
weekly gain, as Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Renault SA
fell, while investors weighed the U.S. manufacturing data to
gauge the outlook for the  Federal Reserve ’s stimulus program.  RBS slid 7.5 percent after predicting a “substantial”
annual loss because of writedowns. Renault declined 5 percent
after its partner Nissan Motor Co. cut its full-year profit
forecast. Vodafone Group Plc rose to the highest price in 12 1/2
years after people familiar with the matter said AT&T Inc. is
exploring a takeover of the company.  The Stoxx 600 lost 0.3 percent to 321.5 points. The gauge
climbed 0.4 percent this week, yesterday closing at its highest
level since May 2008, as the Federal Reserve refrained from
paring bond buying and as companies from BNP Paribas SA to
Volkswagen AG reported better-than-forecast profit.  “With markets at new highs, we need a breather,” Karim Bertoni, a Geneva-based European equities analyst at De Pury
Pictet Turrettini & Co., which manages about $3.3 billion, said
by telephone. “We could see the markets go slightly down for a
couple of weeks before going up again. Recent data indicate
we’re seeing a subdued improvement in the global economy but not
a huge rebound.”  National benchmark indexes fell in 11 of the 16 western
European markets open today. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 added less than
0.1 percent.  Germany ’s DAX lost 0.3 percent.  France’s CAC 40 (CAC) 
slid 0.6 percent. Stock markets in Austria and Luxembourg were
closed, with Sweden open for half a day, for All Saints Day.  Manufacturing Gauges  In the U.S., the  Institute for Supply Management ’s
manufacturing  index  rose to 56.4 last month from September’s
56.2. Readings above 50 indicate expansion. Economists had
projected a drop to 55. The report follows data from  China ,
where the official manufacturing gauge rose more than forecast
to an 18-month high. A Chinese PMI from HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics also topped projections.  Investors are watching data to gauge the health of the  U.S.
economy  after the Federal Reserve this week said it needs to see
more evidence of sustained improvement before slowing the pace
of its monthly bond purchases.  RBS (RBS)  fell 7.5 percent to 340 pence, its biggest retreat
since June 2012. Britain’s biggest publicly owned lender said it
will write down as much as 4.5 billion pounds ($7.2 billion) in
the fourth quarter after transferring 38.3 billion pounds of its
riskiest loans to an internal bad bank. RBS also posted a net
loss of 828 million pounds in the third quarter.  Nissan Outlook  Renault dropped 5 percent to 61.29 euros. Nissan lowered
its full-year profit forecast by 15 percent.  Japan ’s second-biggest carmaker expects to post net income of 355 billion yen
($3.6 billion) in the year ending March, compared with its
previous estimate of 420 billion yen and the average projection
of 440.3 billion yen in a Bloomberg survey.  Meggitt Plc tumbled 11 percent to 509 pence, its largest
decline since September 2001. The world’s biggest provider of
wheels and brakes for military aircraft cut its full-year sales
forecast, citing short-term production problems at a unit.
Meggitt predicted sales growth in low single digits, compared
with a previous forecast for a mid-single-digit increase.  Vodafone advanced 3.6 percent to 232.5 pence, its highest
price since May 1, 2001. People familiar with the matter said
that AT&T plans to create the world’s largest telecommunications
operator by acquiring  Europe ’s biggest mobile carrier next year.
AT&T executives are discussing internally which of Vodafone’s
assets the U.S. company could retain if a deal happened, the
people said.  New CEO  OC Oerlikon Corp. climbed 3.5 percent to 13.15 Swiss
francs. The largest textile-machinery maker appointed Brice Koch
as chief executive officer, seven months after Michael Buscher
quit. Koch previously led ABB Ltd.’s power-systems division.  Pandora A/S gained 2.9 percent to 269.60 kroner, its
highest price since March 2011. The Danish jeweler raised its
full-year sales forecast to 8.6 billion kroner ($1.56 billion),
from a previous projection of 8 billion kroner. Pandora expects
the margin on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization will be about 30 percent, compared with a previous
prediction of about 27 percent.  ASM International NV, which makes machines used to turn
silicon wafers into chips, rose 3.9 percent to 25.26 euros after
reporting third-quarter sales of 116.4 million euros ($158
million). The surpassed the 110.4 million euros forecast on
