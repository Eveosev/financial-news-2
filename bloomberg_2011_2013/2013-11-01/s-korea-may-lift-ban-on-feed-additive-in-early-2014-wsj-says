South Korea  may lift a ban on the use
of an animal feed additive in meat early next year, a move that
could lead to the resumption of some U.S. beef imports suspended
last month, the Wall Street Journal reported.  A government risk assessment has determined that zilpaterol
could be permitted at certain levels, the newspaper said, citing
Son Seong Wan, a director at South Koreaâ€™s Ministry of Food and
Drug Safety. The substance is banned in South Korea.  South Korea last month halted beef imports from a U.S. unit
of JBS SA after finding traces of zilpaterol in a consignment of
the meat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
