Kansai Electric Power Co. (9503) ,  Japan ’s
second-biggest power company, expanded its sources of crude to
include Malaysia, Russia and  Angola  as consumption increased
fivefold following the Fukushima disaster in 2011.  Kansai Electric imported 5.42 million kiloliters of oil, or
about 93,000 barrels a day, from seven countries in the year
ended March 31, Akihiro Aoike, a Tokyo-based spokesman for the
company, said by phone. That’s compared with 1.07 million
kiloliters from five suppliers in fiscal 2010, he said.  Kansai Electric, the country’s most nuclear-reliant
utility, is burning more fossil fuels as its reactors remain
shut after the Fukushima crisis in March 2011. The Osaka-based
utility shut its last operating reactor in September with no
official schedule set for restarting any of its 11 units,
leaving it little choice but to use more crude amid limited
spare coal and gas capacity.  “The top priority was to secure enough volume, and it was
impossible to cover the increased amount without expanding
sources,” Aoike said. The company plans to maintain diversified
suppliers of imports for the time being, Aoike said. He declined
to identify the grades of crude the utility imported from each
country.  The following table shows Kansai Electric’s fiscal 2010 and
2012 crude imports by country.  To contact the reporters on this story:
