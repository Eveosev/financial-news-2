Edgen Group Inc. (EDG) , a distributor of
oilfield pipes and valves, sued to block a shareholder lawsuit
filed in Louisiana over the companyâ€™s agreement to be acquired
by  Sumitomo Corp. (8053)  of America.  Shareholder Jason Genoud should be barred from prosecuting
claims in Louisiana state court because he consented to
exclusive jurisdiction in  Delaware  when he acquired an interest
in shares of the company, Edgen said in a complaint filed
yesterday in Delaware Chancery Court.  Edgen, based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said Oct. 1 that it
agreed to be bought by Sumitomo for $12 a share in cash. The
deal, which is expected to be completed by the end of the year,
has a termination fee of $20 million.  Genoud, an Alberta, Canada, resident, filed a proposed
class-action lawsuit on behalf of other Edgen shareholders on
Oct. 11 alleging company directors breached their fiduciary duty
by agreeing to an inadequate sale price. Edgen has asked the
court to dismiss that case, according to a company filing.  The Louisiana case is Genoud v. Edgen Group Inc., 625244,
Nineteenth Judicial District Court, East  Baton Rouge  Parish. The
Delaware case is Edgen Group Inc. v Genoud, CA9055, Delaware
Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
