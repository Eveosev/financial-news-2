Palm oil advanced, sending futures
into a bull market and capping the biggest weekly gain in almost
three years, on speculation that rain may have reduced
production in top suppliers Indonesia and  Malaysia .  Futures rose 1.2 percent to 2,623 ringgit ($827) a metric
ton on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives, the highest close since
September 2012. That’s 21 percent more than the 2,167 ringgit
settlement on July 29, meeting the common definition of a bull
market. Palm increased 7.3 percent this week, the most since
2010, and is heading for its first annual gain in three years.  Prices climbed on concern that output is less than analysts
expected and that the start of the monsoon this month would
further curb supply. While palm is produced year-round, output
 peaks  from July to October. Several major plantations in
Indonesia reported production unexpectedly fell 7 percent to 10
percent in the first 10 months because of rain and the growing
cycle, said Derom Bangun, chairman of the palm oil board.  “It’s a combination of lower stocks and lower-than-expected production year-to-date from  Indonesia ,” Ivy Ng, an
analyst at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd., said by phone from Kuala
Lumpur. “The third quarter is the peak-production season and
the fact that it’s not matching last year’s production has
gotten people a bit excited.” Stockpiles are also lower, she
said.  Discount Shrinks  Inventories in Malaysia were probably 1.83 million tons
last month, Ng wrote in a report today, lowering her estimate by
about 3 percent. That’s 27 percent less from a year earlier and
the lowest level for October since 2010, according to data from
the palm oil board. Prices rose 12 percent in October 2010 and
extended gains by 24 percent through December that year.  The commodity tumbled into a bear market in June 2012 as
production outpaced demand. Concern that rains are curbing
output contrasts with estimates of increasing supply from the
U.S. Department of Agriculture. World  production  will advance 5
percent to 58.1 million tons, boosting stockpiles by 17 percent
to an all-time high of 9.2 million tons, the USDA estimates.  “The price improvement could be sustained, although the
upside may be capped” as palm’s discount to soybean oil
narrows, Ng said in the report.  The  gap  shrank to $91.58 a ton, the smallest since May 2012
and compared with $379 in October last year. The 14-day relative
strength index for palm was 78.8. Some traders see readings
above 70 as a sign a drop in prices is imminent.  Soybean oil for December delivery advanced 0.9 percent to
41.72 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, while
soybeans for January were little changed at $12.665 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for May delivery gained 1.3 percent to end
at 6,374  yuan  ($1,045) a ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange
and soybean oil rose 1.2 percent to end at 7,302 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
