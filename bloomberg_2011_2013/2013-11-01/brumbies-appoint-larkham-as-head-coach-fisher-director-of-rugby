The ACT Brumbies appointed
 Australia ’s 1999 World Cup-winning fly-half Stephen Larkham and
former head coach Laurie Fisher to lead the team for the next
two Super Rugby seasons.  Larkham was named as head coach and will work with director
of rugby Fisher, who coached the Canberra-based franchise from
2005 to 2008 before returning as an assistant in 2012.  The Brumbies opted for the new structure after the shock
resignation of Jake White in September, who requested a release
from his contract seven weeks after taking the side to the final
of southern hemisphere rugby’s elite provincial competition.  Under White, the Brumbies went from 13th place in 2011 to
runners-up in 2013. As well as reaching the Aug. 3 Super Rugby
final, where they lost 27-22 to  New Zealand ’s Chiefs, the
Brumbies became the first provincial team since 1997 to beat the
touring British and Irish Lions in June. Larkham and Fisher had
been White’s assistants.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
