Sales of American Eagle gold  coins  by
the  U.S. Mint  this year have surpassed the total for all of 2012
as the futures market, which tumbled into a  bear market  in
April, heads for the first annual decline since 2000.  In 2013, 755,500 ounces of the coins were sold as of today,
compared with 753,000 ounces last year, according to data on the
mint’s  website . In the month of April,  sales  surged to 209,500
ounces, the most since December 2009, after futures posted the
biggest two-day slump in three decades.  Gold prices on the Comex in New York have climbed 11
percent from a 34-month low of $1,179.40 an ounce in June,
partly as demand for coins, bar and jewelry increased in  Asia .
 China ’s imports of the metal from  Hong Kong  more than doubled to
826 metric tons in the nine months ended Sept. 30 from a year
earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Demand remains healthy, and there are lot of people out
there who want physical gold as hedge against economic
uncertainties,” Miguel Perez-Santalla, a vice president at New
York-based BullionVault, an online service for buying physical
metal, said in a telephone interview  The mint suspended sales of gold coins weighing a 10th of
an ounce from April 23 to May 28 because of a lack of inventory.  Gold futures for December delivery declined 0.8 percent to
close at $1,313.20 today. They have dropped 22 percent this
year. Some investors lost faith in the metal amid a rally to a
record in U.S. equities and muted inflation.  Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-traded product backed by the metal, have dropped 36 percent this
year to the lowest since February 2009, data showed today.  Gold futures rose to a record $1,923.70 on Sept. 6, 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
