Pirates off the Horn of  Africa  pocket
as little as 1 percent of ransoms, which they tend to spend on
alcohol, expensive cars and prostitutes, while financiers keep
as much as three-quarters of the loot, a new  report  shows.  The 129-page joint report by the  World Bank , Interpol and
the  United Nations ’s crime unit opens a window into their
operating rules and lifestyle. It also shows the crime has
evolved from locally funded operations to transnational
networks, costing the global economy about $18 billion in
increased trade expenses.  Piracy has resurfaced in recent years as a menace that’s
disrupting international shipping and hurting the region’s
economy. Groups using rocket-propelled grenades, AK-47s and
tracking devices collected about $400 million from 179 ships
hijacked from April 2005 to December 2012, according to the
report.  “The vast amounts of money collected by pirates, and the
fact that they have faced virtually no constraint in moving and
using their assets, have allowed them not only to thrive, but
also to develop their capacities on land,” Tofik Murshudlu,
chief of the implementation support section in the Organized
Crime and Illicit Trafficking Branch of the UN’s Office of Drugs
and Crime, said in a statement.  The study includes interviews of more than 30 people
involved in piracy off the coast of Somalia. When a ransom is
received, the low-level pirates who hijacked the ship, or “foot
soldiers,” receive $30,000 to $75,000, which amounts to 1
percent to 2.5 percent of the average payment. The first pirate
on board can get as much as much as $10,000 extra, according to
the report.  Financiers receive 30 percent to 75 percent of the total,
according to the report. The proceeds are often reinvested
within Somalia, including in legitimate business activities for
money-laundering purposes, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
