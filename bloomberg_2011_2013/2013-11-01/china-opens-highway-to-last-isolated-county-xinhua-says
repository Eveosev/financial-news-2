China opened a highway in  Tibet 
connecting the nation’s last county without roads to a
neighboring area, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.  The 117-kilometer highway linking Medog county with
neighboring Bome county opened to traffic yesterday, Xinhua
reported. Construction of the road started in April 2009 and
cost 950 million yuan ($156 million), according to Xinhua.  Prior to completion of the road, travel out of Medog
required people to climb two mountains each rising more than
4,000 meters about sea level, Xinhua reported. In 1992, it took
retired Medog official Gyaltsen 14 days to walk to Bome so that
he could travel to Beijing to attending the annual gathering of
the National People’s Congress, Xinhua reported.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
