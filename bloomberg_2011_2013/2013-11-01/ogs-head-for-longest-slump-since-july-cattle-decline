Hog futures fell, heading for the
longest slump in three months, on signs that U.S. pork demand is
easing. Cattle prices dropped to a one-week low.  On Oct. 30,  wholesale pork  slumped 1.5 percent to 92.63
cents a pound, the lowest since May 15, according to the latest
U.S. government data. Yesterday, the cash  price  of hogs for
immediate delivery fell to a six-month low.  “Demand seems to be a bit on the soft side,” Doug Houghton, an analyst at Brock Associates in  Milwaukee , said in a
telephone interview. “It is normal for the hog market to be
weak in this time of the year.”  Hog futures for December settlement fell 0.6 percent to
88.65 cents a pound at 10:58 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The price dropped for the fourth straight day, heading
for the longest slump since July 30.  Cattle futures for December delivery fell 0.3 percent to
$1.32375 a pound. Earlier, the price touched $1.3195, the lowest
for a most-active contract since Oct. 22.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement rose 0.1
percent to $1.639.  To contact the reporter on this story:
