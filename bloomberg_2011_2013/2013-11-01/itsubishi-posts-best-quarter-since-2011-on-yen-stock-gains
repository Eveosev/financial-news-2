Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , Japan’s largest
trading house, recorded its best quarter since the three months
ended June 30, 2011, as a weaker yen helped sell more autos in
 Asia  and a domestic stock rally boosted equity holdings.  Net income jumped 47 percent to 132.7 billion yen ($1.35
billion) in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from 90 billion yen a
year earlier, Tokyo-based Mitsubishi said in a statement today.
First-half profit was 248.4 billion yen, beating the 234.6
billion yen  mean forecast  from three analysts compiled by
Bloomberg.  Mitsubishi and  Mitsui & Co. (8031) , the nation’s two largest
trading companies, forecast in May that a weakening of the
Japanese currency may add almost $1 billion to profit this year.
The yen’s decline has helped inflate U.S. dollar-based commodity
sales while the run-up in Japanese stocks bolstered the value of
domestic equity investments.  Mitsubishi, which adds 2.5 billion yen to profit with every
1 yen drop against the greenback, made 76 billion yen on the
rising value of listed stocks from April to October. The
Japanese currency has declined 11 percent against the  U.S.
dollar  this year.  Lower costs and rising volumes at Mitsubishi’s Australian
coal mines, most of which are part of a joint venture with  BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , helped boost earnings at the Japanese trader’s
mining unit by 71 percent to 22.8 billion yen.  “Coal prices may have hit a bottom in the three months
through September,” Chief Financial Officer Shuma Uchino said
in Tokyo today. “However, the uptrend in prices is taking more
time than we imagined.”  Mitsubishi’s machinery division, which sells autos and
other equipment, contributed the biggest boost to operating
profit. Net income at the unit rose 19 billion yen in the first
half to 50.6 billion yen thanks to the weaker yen and Asian
sales, the trader said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
