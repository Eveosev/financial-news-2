Astro group, controlled by Malaysian
billionaire Ananda Krishnan, will get less than 0.3 percent of
the $250 million it had sought from Lippo group for a failed
pay-television venture,  Singapore ’s highest court ruled.  Lippo units  PT First Media (KBLV)  and PT Ayunda Prima Mitra are
required to pay about $700,000 to five units of Astro, a three-judge panel of the Singapore Court of Appeal decided yesterday.
The ruling overturns a judge’s decision last year that upheld
the $250 million arbitration award.  Eight  Astro  units had sued three units of  Lippo  to enforce
the arbitration award in Singapore. Three of the Astro units,
which were claiming the bulk of the amount, had no arbitration
agreement with First Media and therefore no award could be
enforced, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon wrote on behalf of the
panel in the 119-page ruling.  “First Media is grateful for the decision,” said Edmund
Kronenburg, a lawyer for the Indonesian group.  Tammy Toh, a spokeswoman for Astro, didn’t immediately
reply to an e-mailed request for comment on the ruling.  First Media and Ayunda Prima were ordered to pay the
remaining five Astro units $608,177, 22,500 British pounds
($36,000) and S$65,000 ($52,000), or about $700,000 in total.  Krishnan, who has a net worth of about $8.9 billion
according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and Lippo set up
the TV venture in 2005 and went on to do deals including in
telecommunications. Lippo, founded by Indonesian tycoon Mochtar
Riady, have faced off in courts in U.K.,  Indonesia ,  Malaysia ,
 Hong Kong  and Singapore over the failed venture.  Krishnan’s Astro All Asia Networks had said it ended the
venture in 2008 after the Lippo partners failed to pay 805
million ringgit ($254 million) in bills.  The cases are PT First Media TBK v Astro Nusantara
International BV, CA150/2012, and Astro Nusantara International
BV v PT Ayunda Prima Mitra, CA151/2012. Singapore Court of
Appeal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
