Derek Jeter signed a one-year, $12
million contract with the New York Yankees, remaining with the
only Major League Baseball team he’s played for after a season
he described as an injury-filled nightmare.  The Yankees’ starting shortstop and captain with five World
Series championship rings, Jeter is a 13-time All-Star and the
major leagues’ active hits leader. He will turn 40 during the
2014 season, his 20th in New York, where he holds franchise
records for hits, games played, stolen bases, at-bats and
singles.  The signing, announced by the Yankees yesterday in a news
release, follows a season in which Jeter was placed on the
disabled list four times with ankle and leg injuries and played
in just 17 games. He hit a career-low .190 in 73 plate
appearances.  “This entire year has been pretty much a nightmare for me
physically, so I guess it’s fitting it ends like this,” Jeter
said at a news conference on Sept. 12, the day the Yankees
placed him on the disabled list for the last time this season.  Hit by injuries throughout their roster, the Yankees
finished 85-77, their highest loss total in 21 seasons. Winner
of a record 27 World Series titles, New York missed the playoffs
for the second time since 1995, the year Jeter was called up to
the majors.  The team’s 2013 opening day payroll was $228.8 million,
according to CBS Sports. Team ownership has said it would like
the Yankees to be below $189 million next year to save luxury
tax payments that can be as high as 50 percent of any amount
over that threshold.  ‘Core Four’  Jeter was taken by the Yankees with the No. 6 pick in the
1992 amateur draft. He and two other career-long Yankees, Jorge Posada and Mariano Rivera, made their major league debuts in
1995, forming the nucleus of a team that won the World Series in
1996, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2009. Posada, a catcher, retired
after the 2011 season, and Rivera and Andy Pettitte, pitchers
who completed what was known as the Yankees’ “Core Four,” said
2013 was their final year.  Jeter has batted .312 over 19 seasons with 3,316 hits, 10th
on the career list. He and Hall of Fame outfielder Willie Mays
are the only major league players to have at least 3,000 hits,
250 home runs, 300 stolen bases and 1,200 runs batted in.  New York signed manager Joe Girardi to a four-year contract
extension last month. Outfielder Curtis Granderson and second
baseman Robinson Cano are among the Yankees who will become free
agents on Nov. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
