Hong Kong  stocks  swung between losses
and gains as investors weighed a report showing  China ’s
manufacturing exceeded estimates against the outlook for a
reduction in unprecedented Federal Reserve stimulus.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  dropped 0.2 percent to 23,162.68 as of
9:48 a.m. in Hong Kong, after climbing as much as 0.1 percent.
Property shares advanced while materials companies declined. The
Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, also known as the H-share
index, fell 0.2 percent to 10,610.79.  The  Hang Seng Index  last month gained 1.5 percent, its
first back-to-back monthly advance since January, as China’s
data added to signs the world’s second-largest economy is
stabilizing. Still, the gauge is the second-worst performer this
year among developed markets tracked by Bloomberg. The equity
benchmark traded at 11.1 times estimated earnings yesterday,
compared with 15.9 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  China’s manufacturing  Purchasing Managers ’ Index was 51.4
in October, the National Bureau of Statistics and China
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said today in Beijing.
The reading compares with the median estimate of 51.2 in a
Bloomberg News survey of 31 economists and 51.1 in September. A
number above 50 indicates expansion.  Futures on the  S&P 500  rose 0.2 percent. The U.S. equity
gauge dropped 0.4 percent yesterday on speculation the Fed will
scale back stimulus in coming months as investors assessed
earnings.  Economists at Citigroup Inc. and Barclays Plc said this
week’s Fed policy statement opens the possibility of reduced
bond purchases as soon as December. Strategists surveyed by
Bloomberg Oct. 17-18 had predicted the Fed would begin paring
stimulus in March.  Hong Kong ’s September retail sales rose 4.9 percent by
volume from a year earlier, and climbed 5.1 percent by value,
both missing economists’ estimates, data showed yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
