Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. said third-quarter profit climbed 29 percent on investments
and gains at non-insurance businesses including railroad
Burlington Northern  Santa Fe .  Net income  rose to $5.05 billion, or $3,074 a share, from
$3.92 billion, or $2,373, a year earlier, the Omaha, Nebraska-based company said yesterday in a statement. Operating earnings,
which exclude some investment results, were $2,228 a share,
missing the $2,403 average  estimate  of three analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  Berkshire has benefited from an expanding U.S. economy and
stands to make further gains as consumer demand picks up and the
housing market recovers. The company’s subsidiaries haul
freight, insure cars, generate electricity, make building
supplies and sell products from running shoes to diamond rings.  Acquisitions (BRK/A)  and investments have positioned Berkshire to
be “an all-in bet on the U.S.,” said Bill Smead, chief
executive officer of Smead Capital Management, which oversees
about $680 million including shares of Buffett’s company.
“There’s a lot of earnings leverage.”  Class B shares slipped 0.2 percent to $114.99 at 7:56 p.m.
in New York after the results were released. They had rallied 29
percent this year through yesterday’s close, compared with the
24 percent advance in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Gains on investments, including bets on  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) , General Electric Co. and Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co., added $1.86
billion to earnings before tax, compared with $917 million a
year earlier. Berkshire posted a $427 million gain on
derivatives in the quarter, compared with a $118 million loss a
year earlier. Buffett, 83, uses the contracts to wager on stock
markets and the creditworthiness of borrowers.  Buffett’s Warrants  Buffett, Berkshire’s chairman and CEO, exchanged warrants
in Goldman Sachs and GE after the quarter for common stock. Both
deals stem from investments made during the 2008 financial
crisis. Berkshire booked a profit of $680 million as Mars Inc.
agreed to pay a premium to repurchase bonds that Buffett bought
to help the candy company acquire Wrigley.  BNSF contributed $989 million to earnings, compared with
$937 million a year earlier. Utility unit MidAmerican Energy
Holdings Co. added $472 million, up from $438 million.  Earnings from manufacturing, service and  retailing  units
increased to $1.16 billion in the three months ended Sept. 30
from $991 million in the same period in 2012.  The  U.S. economy  probably expanded at a 1.9 percent
annualized rate in the third quarter, according to the average
estimate in a Bloomberg survey. That’s slower than the 2.5
percent pace in the three months ended June 30.  Housing Market  The housing market rebound cooled in July and August.
Buffett said last week that the U.S. economy is making progress
and that residential real estate still has a way to go in
recovering.  “It’s coming back,” he said at an Oct. 23 event at the
 New York Public Library . “Pricing is better in almost all
markets by a reasonable percentage from a few years ago.”  Berkshire’s book value, a measure of assets minus
liabilities that Buffett uses to gauge his performance, rose in
the quarter to $126,766 per Class A share from $122,900 at the
end of June. Class A shares closed yesterday at $173,123 in  New
York . Each one can be converted into 1,500 Class B shares.  The cash pile climbed to $42.1 billion at the end of
September from $35.7 billion three months earlier. Buffett spent
more than $12 billion in the second quarter in a deal that took
ketchup maker HJ Heinz Co. private.  Insurance Results  Underwriting profit at insurance units declined 57 percent
to $170 million as the frequency and severity of claims
increased at Geico. The loss widened at the reinsurance unit run
by Ajit Jain and hailstorms in  Europe  pressured results at the
General Re business.  Investment income from insurance operations added $861
million to the company’s profit, compared with $733 million in
last year’s third quarter.  Berkshire’s  stock portfolio  was valued at $106.8 billion on
Sept. 30, up from $103.3 billion at the end of June. Buffett and
his deputies spent $1.16 billion on fixed-maturity securities
and $1.77 billion on equities in the quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
