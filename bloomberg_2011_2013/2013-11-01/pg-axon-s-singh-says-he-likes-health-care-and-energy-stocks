Dinakar Singh , founder of $4 billion
hedge-fund firm TPG-Axon Capital Management LP, said he likes
energy and health-care stocks in a market where it’s harder to
find value.  “I’m not worried about the U.S. market, but finding value
is hard,” Singh said today in an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s “Market Makers” with  Erik Schatzker  and Stephanie
Ruhle. “Hospitals and energy are the few areas where there is
real change in the U.S.”  Singh, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partner who co-founded New York-based TPG-Axon in 2004, said most of his
largest investments are outside of the U.S., focusing on Japan,
Asia and Europe because U.S. valuations are “full” and margins
are high. Valuations in Asia are low as investors are shunning
the emerging markets, yielding some “great gems,” he said.  Japan is the best “stock-picking market right now”
because of the government’s economic growth strategy, Singh
said. He said  Hitachi Ltd. (6501)  is a “very good company.”  Singh said he doesn’t think there will be much activism,
where shareholders to push for change in companies, outside of
the U.S.  “It doesn’t work structurally in Japan and the rest of
Asia,” he said. “We would not pick a fight with Sony.”  Sony Corp. (6758) , based in Tokyo, has rejected U.S. hedge-fund
manager Daniel Loeb’s push for a partial sale of its
entertainment assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
