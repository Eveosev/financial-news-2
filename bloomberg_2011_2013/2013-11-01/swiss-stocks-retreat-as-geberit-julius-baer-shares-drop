Swiss stocks  slipped , extending their
loss this week, as  Geberit (GEBN)  AG and  Julius Baer  Group Ltd.
declined and a report showed that Switzerland’s manufacturing
industry expanded at a slower-than-expected pace last month.  Geberit fell 1.3 percent after the maker of toilets
yesterday rallied to the highest price since its initial public
offering in 1999. Julius Baer lost 1.8 percent after Deutsche
Bank AG lowered its rating for Switzerland’s third-largest
wealth manager. ABB Ltd. slid 1.1 percent.  The Swiss Market Index lost 0.4 percent to 8,203.52 at
10:11 a.m. in Zurich, extending its decline this week to 0.6
percent. The gauge rallied 2.6 percent in October, completing
its  biggest two-month advance  since the beginning of the year,
after U.S. lawmakers agreed on a new budget to avoid a sovereign
default and end a partial government shutdown. The broader Swiss
Performance Index also retreated 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
