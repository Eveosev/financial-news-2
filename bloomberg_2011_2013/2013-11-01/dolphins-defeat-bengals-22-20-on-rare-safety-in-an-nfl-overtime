Cameron Wake tackled Cincinnati
quarterback Andy Dalton in the end zone for a two-point safety
to give the Miami Dolphins a 22-20 overtime win against the
Bengals in a National Football League game.  Wake sacked Dalton three times during the game, including
the final play for a loss of eight yards.  “Talk about a team win,” Wake said in a televised
interview. “Everybody had to dig down deep. It was one of those
situations where you had to give it all you had.”  The Dolphins improved to 4-4 and ended a four-game losing
streak, while the Bengals fell to 6-3 on the loss that followed
four straight victories. The game ended with a safety in
overtime for the third time in NFL history.  “The defense played great all day,” said Miami
quarterback Ryan Tannehill, who threw for 208 yards. “When the
game counted at the end, Wake stepped up and it was huge.”  Mike Nugent put the Bengals on the scoreboard in the second
quarter with a 31-yard field goal. The Dolphins rallied for a
10-3 halftime advantage on Tannehill’s one-yard run and Caleb
Sturgis’s 36-yard field goal.  In the second half, Brent Grimes intercepted a Dalton pass
and ran 94 yards for a Dolphins touchdown. Giovani Bernard then
had back-to-back scores on a three-yard sprint and a 35-yard run
to tie the game at 17-17.  Nugent kicked a 54-yard field goal with 84 seconds left in
regulation to give the Bengals a short-lived three-point lead
until Sturgis sent it into overtime with a 44-yarder with 11
seconds remaining.  Dalton passed for 338 yards and three interceptions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
