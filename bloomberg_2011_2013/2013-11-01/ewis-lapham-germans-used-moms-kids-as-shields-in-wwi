During the early months of World War
I, German atrocities were common, approved by the military and
praised by the Kaiser.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  A German brigade commander was killed in Aarschot,  Belgium ,
on Aug. 19, 1914, likely by “friendly fire.” In retaliation, 76
male hostages were murdered, and the town was looted and burned.  A wounded Irish soldier reported seeing Germans using
civilians, including women and children, as human shields.  At Seilles, Belgium, 200 civilians were rounded up and
shot, the town torched. A German officer wrote in his diary on
Aug. 22: “A family sits on the pavement before one house that is
still burning: they watch until the last rafters collapse,
crying and crying...Our soldiers get used to drinking and
looting.”  During -- and even after the war -- these atrocity stories
were often discounted as propaganda, but recent scholarship
records 129 “major” and 383 “minor” documented incidents, with
6,427 civilians known to have been murdered by the Germans
during 1914 alone.  I spoke with Max Hastings, author of “Catastrophe 1914:
Europe Goes to War,” on the following topics:  1. Western Front.  2. Schlieffen Plan.  3. German Atrocities.  4. Definitive Marne.  5. Battle of Ypres.  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  (Lewis Lapham is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
