JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  traders
generated profits every day in the third quarter, extending
their perfect record for 2013 as the  Federal Reserve  backed off
plans to curtail a bond-purchase program.  Traders made more than $200 million on three days this
year, JPMorgan said today in a regulatory  filing . The New York-based company is the biggest U.S. lender by assets.  Wall Street  has been whipsawed as the Federal Reserve
debates whether the economy is strong enough to justify reducing
monthly bond purchases of about $85 billion that have kept
borrowing costs low. Ten-year Treasury yields, which are used to
set rates for some consumer and corporate loans, rose from this
year’s low of 1.63 percent on May 2 to 3 percent on Sept. 5.  Trading revenue at JPMorgan’s corporate and investment
bank, run by Daniel Pinto and  Michael Cavanagh , fell 2 percent
to $4.69 billion in the third quarter, the bank said when it
reported earnings on Oct. 11. Fixed-income trading revenue
declined 8 percent to $3.44 billion from a year earlier while
equity-trading revenue rose 20 percent to $1.25 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
