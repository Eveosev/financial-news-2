Dustin Johnson tied the course record
with a 9-under-par 63 to take a five-stroke lead after two
rounds of the HSBC Champions in  China .  Johnson birdied six of the first seven holes today at
Sheshan International Golf Club in  Shanghai . The American made
his only bogey at the 10th hole before adding four more birdies
and is 12 under for the tournament, which is part of the World
Golf Championships.  “It was a lot of fun out there today,” Johnson, the sixth
golfer to shoot 63 at Sheshan, said in an interview on the
European Tour website. “I hit the ball really well, drove it
well and made some good putts. Even the putts I missed, they
looked like they were going in.”  Northern Ireland’s Rory McIlroy is tied for second at 7
under with Americans Boo Weekley and Bubba Watson.  McIlroy shot even-par 72 after bringing a two-shot lead
into today’s play. He birdied the sixth through eighth holes to
become the first player to get to 10 under before three bogeys
over his final eight holes.  “Disappointing, frustrating,” McIlroy said on the PGA
Tour’s website. “Played nicely the front nine and then started
to hit a lot of sloppy shots on the back. Missed the last six
greens in a row.”  Defending champion Ian Poulter of  England  and Ernie Els of
South Africa are among six golfers at 6 under, with American
Phil Mickelson and U.S. Open champion Justin Rose of England
part of a group another shot back.  To contact the reporter on this story:
