West Texas Intermediate headed for
its longest run of weekly declines since June 2012 as an
increase in Chinese manufacturing failed to counter signs that
oil markets are well supplied.  Futures have lost 1.7 percent this week in  New York  for a
fourth weekly drop. Prices will probably extend losses next week
because of rising  crude stockpiles  in the U.S., the world’s
largest oil consumer, according to a Bloomberg survey.  China ’s
 Purchasing Manager’s Index (CPMINDX)  was 51.4 in October, the highest in
18 months and more than the median estimate of 51.2 in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists. A separate manufacturing
indicator also climbed.  “A sharp slowdown in refiner demand and continued strong
inventory builds” in the U.S. have weighed on prices, said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank A/S in
Copenhagen. “We’ve seen a bit of a recovery in China, but this
quarter may be the best for a while.”  WTI for December delivery was at $96.20 a barrel in
electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , down 18
cents, at 11:18 a.m. London time. The U.S. benchmark fell to
$96.38 yesterday, the lowest since June 26, and lost 5.8 percent
in October, the most in a year. The volume of all futures traded
was about 60 percent below the 100-day average.  Brent for December settlement was down 25 cents at $108.594
a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
European benchmark crude was at a premium of $12.39 to WTI
futures, from $12.46 yesterday.  Chinese Factories  Economic data from China released last month showed the
first acceleration in growth in three quarters, with gross
domestic product gaining 7.8 percent from a year earlier. China
will account for about 11 percent of global oil demand this
year, compared with 21 percent for the U.S., according to
forecasts from the  International Energy Agency .  The October PMI released today by the National Bureau of
Statistics and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing is
higher than the level of 51.1 recorded for September. A separate
 manufacturing gauge  from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
increased to 50.9 from 50.2, matching a preliminary figure.
Readings above 50 signal expansion.  Twenty of 29 analysts and traders, or 69 percent, in a
separate Bloomberg survey predicted WTI futures will decrease
through Nov. 8. Seven respondents, or 24 percent, said there
will be an advance and two projected little change.  Crude Supplies  U.S.  crude inventories  climbed by 4.1 million barrels to
383.9 million last week, the highest level since June, data from
the Energy Information Administration showed on Oct. 30. That
was the sixth week of gains.  “Rising stockpiles in the U.S. could keep downward
pressure on prices in the short term, but these inventories will
decline in the weeks ahead as refineries return to production
from autumn maintenance,” said  Gordon Kwan , the regional head
of oil and gas research at Nomura Holdings Inc. in  Hong Kong .  WTI’s slide may slow as a technical indicator shows futures
may be falling too quickly to sustain further losses. The 14-day
relative strength index dropped below 33 yesterday, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. A reading of less than 30 typically
signals a market is oversold. Crude rebounded on Oct. 23 when
the RSI sank to 30.2, the lowest since April.  OPEC’s crude production increased in October after the
completion of maintenance work in  Iraq , a separate Bloomberg
survey showed yesterday. The 12-member Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries boosted daily output by 38,000 barrels to an
average of 30.621 million barrels, up from a revised 30.583
million in September, according to the survey of  oil companies ,
producers and analysts.  Libya, Nigeria  Libya  was producing 350,000 to 400,000 barrels a day,
Ibrahim Al Awami, the oil ministry’s head of measurement and
inspection, said by phone yesterday, or about 100,000 barrels a
day more than earlier this week. The nation reopened a port,
Hariga, though several others remain shut, preventing exports.  U.S. imports of Nigerian crude averaged 134,000 barrels a
day in August, the lowest since February 1985, EIA data showed
this week. West Africa’s biggest oil exports to  Asia  in almost
two years are threatened by competing Russian supply and new
refineries capable of processing cheaper crude from the  Middle
East .  To contact the reporter on this story:
