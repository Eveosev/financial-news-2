General Motors Co. (GM)  and  Ford Motor Co. (F) 
reported U.S. sales gains for October as demand recovered
following the 16-day government shutdown and remained on pace
for the best year since 2007.  Sales of cars and light trucks rose 16 percent at GM, 14
percent at Ford and 11 percent at Chrysler Group LLC. The
results compared with analysts’ average estimates for increases
of 7.9 percent for GM, 16 percent for Ford and 14 percent for
Chrysler in a survey by Bloomberg News. Toyota Motor Corp.,
 Honda Motor Co. (7267)  and Nissan Motor Co. gains trailed estimates.  Showroom traffic and sales accelerated after Congress and
President  Barack Obama  agreed to fund the government and lift
the debt limit Oct. 17, automakers said. Automakers came within
6,000 deliveries of 13 million through the year’s first 10
months. Annual sales failed to cross that threshold in the three
years through 2011.  “We’re seeing the resiliency of the consumer yet again,”
Michelle Krebs, an analyst at auto researcher Edmunds.com, said
in a telephone interview. “While we saw a little bit of
slowdown during the shutdown, it picked right back up. We’re
expecting a strong close and then a strong 2014.”  Sales of cars and light trucks climbed 11 percent to 1.21
million, researcher Autodata Corp. said in an e-mail. That
trailed the 1.22 million average of nine estimates in the
Bloomberg survey. The annualized industry  sales rate , adjusted
for seasonal trends, rose to 15.2 million, missing the 15.4
million average estimate of 14 analysts. The sales pace was 14.4
million a year earlier.  Major Purchase  Deliveries for GM rose at all four brands, led by Buick’s
31 percent gain. Sales of the Silverado and Sierra large pickups
increased 10 percent and 13 percent, respectively. The Detroit-based company this week posted third-quarter profit that beat
estimates on demand for the redesigned Silverado truck, Impala
sedan and Cadillac cars.  “What’s going on in  Washington  does have an impact at the
margin, but it’s more like what we’ve seen with oil prices in
recent years,” Mustafa Mohatarem, GM’s chief economist, said
today on a conference call. “It may change people’s perspective
on exactly when to pull the trigger on buying a new vehicle,
which is a major purchase.”  Ford’s Fusion sedan sales climbed 71 percent to 21,740. The
Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker has gained share in the mid-size car market, long dominated by  Toyota (7203) ’s Camry, the top
seller for the segment and among all passenger cars.  “What we saw early in the month was some softness, but we
were very encouraged when we saw the retail demand in the
industry bounce back,” John Felice, Ford’s vice president of
U.S. marketing, sales and service, said on a conference call.  Fusion, Camry  Toyota sales climbed 8.8 percent, missing the 13 percent
average estimate of six analysts. The Toyota City, Japan-based
company delivered 29,144 Camrys in October, down 2.6 percent.
Sales of the car through the year’s first 10 months rose 1
percent to 348,134, while Fusion was up 20 percent to 248,033.  GM rose 1.2 percent to $37.39 at the close in New York
while Ford fell 1.3 percent to $16.89. The shares have gained 30
percent for each automaker, as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
increased 24 percent.  Chrysler, majority-owned by  Fiat SpA (F) , reported its first
579 sales for the Cherokee sport-utility vehicle, which
originally was supposed to begin deliveries months earlier.  “After a choppy start to the beginning of the month,
Chrysler Group sales accelerated in the second half of the month
with renewed  consumer confidence  and the launch of our all-new
Jeep Cherokee,”  Reid Bigland , head of U.S. sales for the Auburn
Hills, Michigan-based automaker, said in a statement.  Burgundy’s Durango  Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne is introducing
redesigned SUVs including Cherokee and the Dodge Durango,
featured in co-branded ads for the movie “Anchorman 2: The
Legend Continues,” to extend Chrysler’s sales-gain streak
beyond 3 1/2 years.  Durango monthly sales rose 59 percent to 5,120. Actor Will Ferrell starred in 70 television and online  promotions  for the
new Durango and Paramount Pictures’ “Anchorman 2,” which
features him as Ron Burgundy and will be released Dec. 20.
Chrysler said the SUV’s campaign generated more than  7 million
views  as of Oct. 30.  “Consumers showed resiliency in October with steady auto
sales despite headwinds caused by the government shutdown,”
Bill Fay, group vice president of Toyota brand sales, said in an
e-mailed statement.  Deliveries rose 7.1 percent for Honda and 14 percent for
Nissan. The automakers trailed the average estimates of six
analysts for gains of 12 percent by Tokyo-based Honda and 17
percent by Yokohama, Japan-based Nissan.  Hyundai-Kia  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  and affiliate  Kia Motors Corp. (000270) ’s combined
deliveries advanced 0.6 percent, missing the 2.8 percent average
estimate of six analysts. The Seoul-based carmakers have trailed
the industrywide sales pace each month since September 2012.  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  reported an 11 percent decline in combined
October sales for the Wolfsburg, Germany-based company’s VW and
Audi brands. That trailed the 3.3 percent gain that was the
average the average of three estimates.  Deliveries for VW brand, which plunged 18 percent to 28,129
in October, are at risk of missing the company’s 2018 U.S. sales
target by 33 percent, IHS Automotive estimates. The goal for
800,000 sales in the market is part of a broader aim to become
the world’s biggest automaker in the same time frame.  “We understand Europe, we understand  China  and we
understand  Brazil ,” VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech told Bloomberg
News at an event in Vienna last month. “But we only understand
the U.S. to a certain degree so far.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
