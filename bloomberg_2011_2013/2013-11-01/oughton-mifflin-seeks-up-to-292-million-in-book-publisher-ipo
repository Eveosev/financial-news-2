Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Co., the
educational  book publisher  backed by hedge-fund manager  John
Paulson , is planning an initial public offering that may raise
as much as $292 million.  The company’s selling stockholders, including Paulson &
Co., Avenue Capital Group and  Blackrock Inc. (BLK) , are offering 18.3
million shares for $14 to $16 apiece, according to a regulatory
filing today. The existing shareholders will receive all the
proceeds from the offering.  Houghton Mifflin  emerged from bankruptcy  in June of last
year, issuing all of its outstanding common stock to the lenders
in exchange for canceling its secured debt. These shareholders
are offering a 13 percent stake in publisher. At the high end of
the marketed range, Houghton Mifflin would be valued at about
$2.24 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Houghton Mifflin, based in Boston, has been publishing
since 1832 and obtained 88 percent of revenue from its
educational segment last year, mostly in the U.S. Other sales
come from its trade segment, which is driven by bestselling
titles such as “The Hobbit” and “Life of Pi.”  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley are managing
the Houghton Mifflin IPO. The company applied to list its shares
on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol HMHC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
