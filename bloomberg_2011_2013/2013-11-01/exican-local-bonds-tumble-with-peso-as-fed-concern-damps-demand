Mexico ’s benchmark peso bonds headed
for their worst week since August on speculation the U.S.
Federal Reserve will curtail a monetary stimulus program that
has buoyed emerging-market assets.  Yields on the securities due in 2024 climbed eight basis
points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 6.11 percent at 8:38 a.m.
in Mexico City, the fifth straight daily increase, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The yields have risen 41 basis
points this week, the most since the five days ended Aug. 16.
The currency fell 0.4 percent to 13.0762 per  U.S. dollar  today,
extending its drop since Oct. 25 to 1.5 percent.  “Any possibility that tapering is on earlier than expected
will take everybody out, especially Mexico, because there’s a
lot of liquidity there,  Pedro Tuesta , a senior economist at
4cast Ltd., said in a telephone interview from  Washington .  The slump in the Mexican government’s local-currency debt
deepened this week after the Fed said it saw improvement in the
world’s largest economy, a sign the central bank may soon taper
stimulus that has helped fuel foreign demand for the Latin
American nation’s bonds. U.S. manufacturing grew in October at a
faster pace than forecast, a report showed today.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s index for U.S.
manufacturing climbed to 56.4, the highest since April 2011, the
Tempe, Arizona-based group said today. The median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 55. Readings above 50
indicate growth. Mexico sends almost 80 percent of its exports
to its northern neighbor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
