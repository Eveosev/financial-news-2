Asian  stocks  fell, with the regional
benchmark index paring its weekly advance, as speculation the
 Federal Reserve  will reduce stimulus in coming months
overshadowed improving  China  manufacturing data.  Sony (6758)  Corp. slumped the most in five years in  Tokyo  after
the television and digital camera maker unexpectedly lowered its
full-year profit forecast by 40 percent. Sydney Airport sank 3.6
percent after its largest shareholder Macquarie Group Ltd.
announced plans to give some of its stake to its investors.
Panasonic Corp. surged 6.2 percent, a fifth day of gains, after
doubling its full-year profit forecast.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 0.5 percent to 141.61 as
of 6:56 p.m. in  Hong Kong , as all 10 industry groups retreated.
More than two shares declined for each that rose. The measure
has advanced 0.2 percent this week and climbed 2.7 percent in
October for its first back-to-back monthly rally since April.  This is “the start of a phase of consolidation that should
last a few weeks,” Michael Bogoevski, head of sales trading at
CMC Markets in Sydney, said in an e-mail. “There is the
likelihood that the Fed is looking to cut back on its bond-buying program in the coming weeks or months, not in March as
previously forecast.”  U.S. data yesterday showed the biggest jump in a gauge of
business activity in more than three decades and a drop in
jobless claims, before a report today projected to show American
factory output expanded. Chinese manufacturing grew in October
at a faster pace than the previous month, according to an
official report today.  Regional Gauges  Japan ’s Topix index lost 0.9 percent and Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.3 percent.  Singapore ’s Straits Times
Index declined 0.3 percent and Taiwan’s  Taiex Index  retreated
0.7 percent. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index gained 0.1 percent. Hong
Kong’s Hang Seng Index added 0.2 percent and China’s Shanghai
Composite gained 0.4 percent. South Korea’s Kospi Index rose 0.5
percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index’s October advance pushed its
price-earnings ratio to 13.7  times  estimated earnings from 12.7
at the end of August, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That compares with 15.9 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and
14.9 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index yesterday.  A little more than a half of the 307 companies in the Asia-Pacific measure tracked by Bloomberg that reported results this
quarter and for which estimates are available have missed
 analyst predictions  for profit, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Sony sank 11 percent to 1,668 yen, the biggest slump since
Oct. 24, 2008, as stalling television and digital camera demand
and box office flops curbed its outlook.  NTT, Panasonic  NTT Data Corp. (9613)  declined 4.8 percent to 3,095 yen after the
network-service provider cut its full-year net-income and
operating-profit forecasts.  Panasonic surged 6.2 percent to 1,046 yen.  SoftBank Corp. (9984) 
advanced 3.4 percent to 7,550 yen after quarterly profit at
Japan’s No. 3 wireless carrier beat analyst estimates.  Japan’s Topix trailed every other developed market last
month, with the steepest rally in 40 years petering out on
concern a higher  sales tax  will curb growth while U.S. stimulus
bolsters the yen. The gauge rose less than 0.1 percent in
October, the smallest gain among 24 developed markets tracked by
Bloomberg. The measure remains the best performer this year with
a 37 percent surge.  Futures on the  S&P 500  rose 0.1 percent today. The equity
gauge yesterday slipped 0.4 percent on speculation the Fed will
scale back stimulus in coming months as investors assessed
earnings.  Sydney Airport  lost 3.6 percent to A$4.04. Macquarie plans
to issue about 340 million of the company’s shares to its
holders on Jan. 13 and to distribute one Sydney Airport share
for each Macquarie share.  To contact the reporters on this story:
