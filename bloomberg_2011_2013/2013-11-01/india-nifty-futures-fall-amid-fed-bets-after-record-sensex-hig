Indian (SENSEX)  stock-index futures fell after
the benchmark index closed at a record high yesterday and
speculation increased that the U.S. Federal Reserve may soon
reduce monetary stimulus.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for November delivery dropped
0.3 percent to 6,303 at 10:48 a.m. in  Singapore . The underlying
CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index gained 0.8 percent to 6,299.15 yesterday, its
highest level since Nov. 9, 2010. The S&P BSE Sensex increased
0.6 percent, extending this week’s gain to 2.3 percent. The Bank
of  New York  Mellon  India  ADR Index of U.S.-traded shares slipped
0.1 percent.  U.S. data yesterday showing a jump in business activity and
fewer jobless claims in the world’s biggest economy fueled
concern that the Fed will begin paring its bond-purchase program
as soon as December. Monetary stimulus has helped spur $2.6
billion of net foreign inflows into Indian shares this month
through Oct. 30 and $16 billion of purchases in 2013, the most
among 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg after  Japan .  “Profit booking is likely on rallies, though corrections
must be seen as good opportunity for taking fresh longs,”
Rakesh Goyal, a senior vice president at Bonanza Portfolio Ltd.,
wrote in an e-mail yesterday.  The Sensex advanced 9.2 percent last month, the most since
January 2012. The gauge is up 9 percent this year, the best
performance among the four-largest  emerging markets . It trades

posted results surpassed analyst estimates, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. About 47 percent of the 30 companies in the
index missed forecasts in the previous quarter.  Multi Commodity Exchange of India Ltd. may be active.
