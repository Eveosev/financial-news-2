Advisers to  Norwegian Energy Co. ASA (NOR) ,
a North Sea oil producer facing insolvency, are proposing better
terms on part of a 3.1 billion kroner ($520 million) refinancing
after  bondholders  threatened to scupper the plan.  Pareto Securities AS and Arctic Securities ASA are
proposing improved terms to the holders of Noreco’s three
unsecured bonds, according to a copy of a document sent by the
company’s advisers today. The three bonds have an outstanding
value of 1.3 billion kroner.  Chief Executive Officer Svein Arild Killingland declined to
comment on whether Noreco had offered better terms, saying it
was “always open to alternative proposals that safeguard the
balance” of its initial plan.  Noreco, based in Stavanger, is seeking bondholder approval
to replace six bonds with four new ones carrying lower interest
rates and longer maturities.  The company has suffered intermittent output at the
Huntington field in the U.K. North Sea and a slew of shutdowns
at Oselvar in  Norway  as well as at Nini, Nini East and Cecilie
in the Danish North Sea. It may also need to raise 500 million
kroner ($85 million) to cover the cost of abandoning facilities
off  Denmark ’s shores.  Bankers at Pareto and Arctic weren’t immediately available
when Bloomberg called their offices in Oslo seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
