Tranmere Rovers midfielder Joe
Thompson has been diagnosed with cancer, the third-tier English
soccer club said on its website.  Thompson, 24, underwent medical tests after feeling ill
which confirmed he contracted nodular sclerosing Hodgkin’s
disease, the club said. He’ll shortly begin a six-month course
of chemotherapy.  Thompson has two goals in eight apperances this season, but
hasn’t played since September. He joined Tranmere from Rochdale
in 2012.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
