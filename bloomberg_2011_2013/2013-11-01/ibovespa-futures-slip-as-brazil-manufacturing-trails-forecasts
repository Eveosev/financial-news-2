Ibovespa  futures  fell after a report
showed Brazil’s industrial production increased less than
analysts forecast in September.  OSX Brasil SA (OSXB3) , the shipbuilder founded by former
billionaire  Eike Batista , may move after saying in a regulatory
filing it may submit a request for bankruptcy protection.
Insurance company  Sul America SA (SULA11)  may move after Banco Santander
SA cut its recommendation on the stock to hold.  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in December declined
0.3 percent to 54,370 at 9:22 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real
dropped 0.3 percent to 2.2459 per dollar. The Bloomberg Base
Metals 3-Month Price index added 0.4 percent after an official
manufacturing gauge released by China’s statistics bureau and
its logistics federation reached an 18-month high of 51.4 in
October, beating the 51.2 median estimate among analysts.  In Brazil,  industrial production  expanded 2 percent in
September from a year earlier, the national statistics agency
reported. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast an
increase of 3 percent.  The Ibovespa entered a bull market Sept. 9 after rising 20
percent from this year’s low on July 3 through that day. The
gauge is still down 19 percent in dollar terms this year,
compared with a decline of 2.4 percent for the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume of stocks in  Sao Paulo  was 7.95 billion
reais yesterday, compared with a daily average of 7.61 billion
reais this year through Oct. 22, according to the latest data
available from the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
