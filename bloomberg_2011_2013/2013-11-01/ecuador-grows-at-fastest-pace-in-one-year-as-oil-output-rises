Ecuador’s economy in the second
quarter grew at the fastest pace in a year as increased  consumer
spending  and crude output offset slowdowns in construction and
retail.  Gross domestic product rose 1.2 percent from the previous
 quarter , its fastest pace since the second quarter of 2012, the
central bank said today in a report on its  website . The economy
expanded 3.5 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier,
unchanged from the prior three months.  Ecuador, an OPEC nation that relies on oil exports for
about a third of its budgeted revenue, boosted crude output as
investments in new technology at so-called mature  oil wells  came
online, the bank said. The increase helped the government
finance public spending and drive economic growth, said
Francisco Briones, an analyst at the Guayaquil-based economic
and political research company  Inteligencia Estrategica .  Oil revenues “directly affect growth by affecting
government revenue and hence  government spending ,” Briones, who
forecast an expansion of 3.5 percent in the second quarter from
the prior year, said in an e-mailed response to questions before
the data was released. “A large part of public spending is
channeled to  road construction , infrastructure and mortgage
lending.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
