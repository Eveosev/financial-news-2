HS2 Ltd., the company building a
high-speed rail line from  London  to the north of  England , has
been ordered to study ways of improving journey times to
 Scotland , U.K. Transport Minister Susan Kramer said.  The 50 billion-pound ($80 billion) line, which will connect
London to Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds, can benefit Scotland
if connections to existing lines to the north are properly
managed, Kramer said today.  “Scotland will already benefit from day one with reduced
journey times to and from London, and once the full network is
open these times will be reduced by up to an hour,” Kramer said
in an e-mailed statement. “We want to see if more can be done
and so we are commissioning this study.”  Lawmakers in the House of Commons yesterday voted through
the latest stage of the legislation needed for the line to be
built, giving the government powers to pay for property
purchases, surveys and compensation for affected homeowners.  HS2 trains are intended to reach speeds as high as 225
miles (362 kilometers) an hour on the proposed 335 miles of
track from London to the northern cities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
