Private-equity firms Pamplona Capital
Management LLP and Rhone Capital LLC are considering bids for
Innovia Films Ltd., the U.K. food and tobacco packaging maker
owned by Arle Capital Partners LLP, according to four people
with knowledge of the matter.  Platinum Equity LLC may also make an offer for the Wigton,
England-based company, which is valued at about 500 million
euros ($676 million), said the people who asked not to be
identified because the talks are private.  Initial bids are likely to be made at the end of November,
two of the people said. Candover Partners Ltd., the former
manager of Arle’s investments, acquired the business in a
transaction valued at about 320 million euros in 2004.  Innovia is the last company remaining in the 2001 Candover
fund, which has been managed by Arle since 2011, following the
sale of defense company Qioptiq Ltd. to Excelitas Technologies
Corp. for an undisclosed sum in September.  Officials at Arle and Pamplona declined to comment, while
spokesmen for Rhone, Platinum and Innovia didn’t respond to an
e-mail and telephone requests seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
