India ’s 10-year government bonds and
the rupee headed for a third weekly loss as the central bank
increased borrowing costs for the second time in less than two
months to rein in inflation.  Reserve Bank  of India Governor Raghuram Rajan, who has said
containing inflation is his top priority, raised the key
repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 7.75 percent on Oct. 29.
This came after data showed  wholesale prices  rose 6.46 percent
in September, the most in seven months, while consumer-price
gains accelerated to 9.84 percent. The RBI will today auction
debt maturing between 2020 and 2041.  The yield on the 7.16 percent government notes due May 2023
climbed six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, this week to
8.64 percent as of 10:15 a.m. in Mumbai, prices from the RBI’s
trading system show. The rate rose one basis point today.  The rupee weakened 0.7 percent from Oct. 25 and 0.6 percent
today to 61.8937 per dollar, according to prices from local
banks compiled by Bloomberg.  “Inflation concerns do remain in the market,” said  Paresh Nayar , head of money-market and currency trading at FirtRand
Ltd. in Mumbai. “I’d expect the 10-year yield to trade between
8.40 percent and 8.80 percent until December.”  The RBI expects WPI inflation to remain higher than current
levels during most of the rest of the fiscal year through March,
with consumer prices staying around or above 9 percent, it said
Oct. 29. The central bank also cut its  economic growth  forecast
for the year to 5 percent from 5.5 percent.  Rate Swaps  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose two basis
points this week to 8.41 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. It was little changed today.  One-month implied volatility in the rupee, a gauge of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
dropped 142 basis points, or 1.42 percentage points, this week
to 10.25 percent. It jumped 66 basis points today.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards fell 0.7 percent today
to 63.23 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Offshore
non-deliverable contracts declined 0.7 percent to 63.41.
