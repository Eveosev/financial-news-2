Best Buy Co. (BBY)  Chief Executive Officer
Hubert Joly wants to ring up sales tied to the PlayStation 4 and
Xbox One even before the new game consoles go on sale.  The world’s largest consumer-electronics retailer will open
most of its approximately 1,050 U.S. stores as early as 10 p.m. 
on Nov. 14, before  Sony Corp. (6758)  starts selling the PlayStation 4 in 
North America, Chris Koller, Best Buy’s vice president of gaming, 
said in an interview yesterday. The stores also will open early 
when  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s Xbox One goes on sale Nov. 22.  Best Buy is trying to reverse a slide in entertainment
sales caused in part by aging gaming systems and competition
from  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  and  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  Joly, 54, is
betting that customers who otherwise would wait in line outside
of Best Buy stores will instead linger inside and grab gaming
accessories.  “This is the first time we’ve ever done this,” Koller
said by telephone from Richfield, Minnesota, where Best Buy is
based. “Everybody will be able to come in and get everything
they want to go with the console.”  Best Buy is informing employees about plans for selling the
consoles and posting information online for consumers today.  Best Buy shares more than tripled this year through
yesterday, the best performance in the  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index. (SPX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
