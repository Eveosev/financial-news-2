(Corrects gas rig move in second paragraph.)  Rigs targeting oil and natural gas in
the U.S. increased by four this week to 1,742, according to
 Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)   Oil rigs  rose by 19 to 1,376, data posted on the company’s
website show. The  gas  count fell 16 to 360, the Houston-based
field services company said. Miscellaneous rigs rose one to six.  The  total count  gained for the second time in seven weeks.
Rigs have fallen from 1,800 a year earlier as producers use new
technologies to shorten well-boring time and boost productivity
in shale formations. The improvements have driven crude output
to the most in two decades, helping the U.S. meet 86 percent of
its energy needs in the first seven months of 2013, on pace to
be the highest annual rate since 1986.  “Technological advances have led the way to the widespread
use of new oil and natural gas extraction techniques that have
opened up a hydrocarbon resource base dramatically larger than
previous estimates,” the Energy Information Administration, the
Energy Department’s statistical arm, said in an  Oct. 28 report .
“Natural gas production has steadily risen, while the number of
active rigs characterized as targeting natural gas has fallen
dramatically.”  Natural gas for December delivery fell 5.2 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $3.529 per million British thermal units at 1:11
p.m. on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, down 4.6 percent from
a year ago.  U.S. gas stockpiles  rose 38 billion cubic feet in the week
ended Oct. 25 to 3.779 trillion, the highest since December, the
EIA said yesterday.  U.S. oil output fell 0.5 percent to 7.85 million barrels a
day last week, slipping from the highest level since March 1989,
data compiled by the EIA show. Crude  stockpiles  climbed 1.1
percent to 383.9 million barrels, the highest level for this
season in at least 10 years.  West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery
declined $1.37, or 1.4 percent, to $95.01 a barrel on the Nymex,
up 9.1 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
