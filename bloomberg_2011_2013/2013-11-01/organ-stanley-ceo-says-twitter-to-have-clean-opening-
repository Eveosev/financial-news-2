Morgan Stanley Group Inc. (MS)  Chief
Executive Officer James Gorman said he anticipates Twitter Inc.
will have a “cleaner” initial public offering than  Facebook
Inc. (FB)   “We’d like a cleaner opening,” he said on Bloomberg
Television with  Erik Schatzker  yesterday. “For the market’s
integrity, transparency, that would be a very good thing. I
think we’ll get one.”  Morgan Stanley led Facebook’s IPO last year and is now one
of the underwriters of Twitter, which is set to start trading on
the New York Stock Exchange next week. Facebook’s debut on the
Nasdaq Stock Market last year was marred by a software
malfunction that delayed trading for the social network. Nasdaq
OMX Group Inc. paid $10 million to settle regulatory charges
that the error violated securities laws.  Facebook also bumped up the price of its offering before
its debut. The shares later cratered and took more than a year
to recover.  “I don’t think it was an underwriting issue, let me just
leave it at that,” Gorman said in the interview.  Twitter is scheduled to set a final price for its shares on
Nov. 6, and start trading the next day. Twitter had already
gotten enough demand to sell all of its shares before it started
taking orders. The San Francisco-based microblogging site is
offering 70 million shares for $17 to $20 each, indicating it
plans to raise as much as $1.4 billion.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  is leading the offering, working
with Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
