Japanese lawmakers plan to question
 Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411)  officials this month on its loans to
crime groups, ramping up political pressure on top executives at
the country’s third-biggest bank by market value.  The lower house financial affairs committee will seek
testimony as part of plans to discuss the crime-loan issue in
the week starting Nov. 11, ruling Liberal Democratic Party
lawmaker Isshu Sugawara told Bloomberg News in  Tokyo  today.  Mizuho President Yasuhiro Sato is under pressure to explain
how his bank failed to address 200 million yen ($2 million) in
loans made to members of criminal organizations. The Financial
Services Agency is broadening its probe to include inspections
of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. and  Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc. (8316)  from Nov. 5.  Tokyo-based Mizuho this week submitted plans to improve
internal controls and cut pay for executives including Sato, who
has said he was in a position to know about the transactions
from documents circulated in executive meetings. He said this
week he doesn’t recall seeing the issue highlighted in the
reports.  Shinsei Bank Ltd. (8303)  yesterday became the second lender to
reveal loans with crime syndicates. President Shigeki Toma said
his company’s Shinsei Trust & Banking Co. unit had more than 10
transactions with so-called antisocial groups through a consumer
credit company. Tokyo-based Shinsei discovered the loans
following an internal probe after Mizuho was penalized by the
FSA, Toma said at a briefing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
