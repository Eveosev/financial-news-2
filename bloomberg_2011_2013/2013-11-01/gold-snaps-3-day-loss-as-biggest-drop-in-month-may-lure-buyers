Gold advanced, trimming the first
weekly loss in three, as the biggest price drop in a month may
have lured buyers. Platinum and palladium climbed.  Bullion for immediate delivery gained as much as 0.3
percent to $1,326.80 an ounce, and traded at $1,326.25 at 9:06
a.m. in Singapore. Prices that fell 1.6 percent yesterday, the
most since Oct. 1, are down 1.8 percent this week on speculation
the  Federal Reserve  will pare stimulus sooner than expected.  The U.S. central bank said this week there are signs of
“underlying strength” in the largest economy even as policy
makers maintained the $85 billion-a-month in bond buying,
signaling the possibility of reduced purchases as soon as
December, according to Citigroup Inc. and Barclays Plc.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg Oct. 17-18 had predicted the
Fed would begin tapering stimulus in March.  “While monetary policy remains accommodative, the downside
may be limited for now,” said Mark To, head of research at Wing
Fung Financial Group, a Hong Kong-based trader and refiner.
While the Fed’s decision to stand pat this time was expected,
what policy makers said had some Fed watchers speculating that a
policy change could come sooner than expected, To said.  Gold tumbled 21 percent in 2013 after rallying for 12
years, as unprecedented money printing failed to spur inflation
and as investors sold metal at a record pace from exchange-traded products. Assets in  bullion-backed ETPs  contracted for a
10th month in October and are down 29 percent this year after
climbing every year since the first product was listed in 2003.  Trading Volume  Gold for delivery in December traded 0.2 percent higher at
$1,326 an ounce on the Comex in  New York  after dropping 1.9
percent yesterday. Trading volume was 66 percent below the
average for the past 100 days for this time of day.  Spot silver added 0.3 percent to $21.9785 an ounce after
slumping 3.7 percent yesterday. The metal is still heading for a
weekly loss. Platinum rose 0.3 percent to $1,453.43 an ounce and
is little changed this week. Palladium climbed 0.3 percent to
$739.40 an ounce.  South Africa ’s National Union of Mineworkers said it would
strike at Northam Platinum Ltd. Nov. 3, while Solidarity
rejected an offer by Lonmin Plc. Members of the Association of
Mineworkers and Construction Union voted on Oct. 28 to strike at
Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd.’s operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
