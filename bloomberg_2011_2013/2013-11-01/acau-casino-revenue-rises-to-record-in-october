Macau casino revenue jumped 32
percent to a record of 36.5 billion patacas ($4.57 billion) in
October, boosted by mainland Chinese visitors who spent their
Golden Week holiday in the world’s largest gambling hub.  The monthly casino revenue was in line with an average
consensus of 36 billion patacas from seven analysts surveyed by
 Bloomberg News . The previous record was 31.34 billion patacas in
March.  Casino operators such as  Sands China Ltd. (1928)  and  Galaxy
Entertainment Group Ltd. (27)  have been adding entertainment shows
and hotel rooms to draw Chinese tourists to the former
Portuguese enclave. Mainland visitors to Macau rose 12.1 percent
to 722,746 over the October Golden Week holiday from a year
earlier, according to the  Macau Government Tourist Office .  Gambling revenue in the Chinese city gained 18 percent to
297.1 billion patacas ($37.2 billion) in the first 10 months of
this year, close to the $38 billion revenue the city raked in
for the whole of 2012, which was six times of that the  Las Vegas
Strip .  Total visitor arrivals grew 5.7 percent to 896,847 during
the holiday between Oct. 1 and Oct. 7. Mainland visitors have
helped fuel a boom in Macau, the only place in China where
casinos are legal.  Double-Digit Growth  Sands China,  MGM China Holdings Ltd. (2282)  and  Wynn Macau  Ltd.
have all reported double-digit earnings growth in casino revenue
in the third quarter amid an improving Chinese economy. China’s
economic growth accelerated for the first time in three quarters
with gross domestic product rising 7.8 percent in the July-September period from a year earlier.  MGM China reported overnight that third-quarter profit
missed analyst estimates amid rising competition. Bigger rivals
such as Sands and Galaxy Entertainment already have projects on
the increasingly popular Cotai Strip in Macau, a piece of
reclaimed land that is Asia’s equivalent of the Las Vegas Strip.  MGM has one Macau casino on the peninsula and is building
its second resort in Cotai.  MGM shares rose 1 percent to close at HK$27 in Hong Kong
trading today, Sands China and Galaxy gained 1.8 percent while
Wynn Macau dropped 0.8 percent and Melco Crown Entertainment
fell 0.6 percent.  SJM Holdings Ltd. (880) , founded by Macau casino
mogul  Stanley Ho , was unchanged. The Hong Kong benchmark Index
advanced 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
