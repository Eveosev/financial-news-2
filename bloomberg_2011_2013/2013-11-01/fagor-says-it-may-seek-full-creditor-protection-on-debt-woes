Fagor Electrodomesticos Soc. Coop.
said it may seek full protection from creditors if the Spanish
appliance maker can’t refinance debt.  The manufacturer of refrigerators, washing machines and
ovens is in talks with lenders after seeking preliminary
creditor protection on Oct. 16, the employee-owned company said
in a regulatory  filing  today. Its Polish unit, Fagor Mastercook
SA, filed for protection at a court in San Sebastian, northern
Spain yesterday.  Fagor had 850 million euros ($1.16 billion) of debt as of
June 30, Elena Goirizelaia, a spokeswoman for the company said
in a telephone interview yesterday. That figure includes 185
million euros of subordinated debt and creditors include
employees, she said.  “Fagor continues to carry out all possible steps to
refinance its debts and to use any alternative ways of resolving
the situation,” the company said in the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
