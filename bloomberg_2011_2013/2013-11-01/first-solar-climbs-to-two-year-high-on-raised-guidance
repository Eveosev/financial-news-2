First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the largest U.S.
solar-panel manufacturer, climbed to a two-year high after the
company boosted its profit forecast for the year.  First Solar rose 18 percent to $59.14 at the close in New
York, the highest closing price for the Tempe, Arizona-based
company’s shares since Oct. 10, 2011.  Sales of solar power plants First Solar built in  Canada ,
and accelerated recognition of revenue from a plant under
construction in California will boost per-share profit for the
year to $4.25 to $4.50 a share, up from an August estimate of
$3.75 to $4.25, Chief Executive Officer Jim Hughes said
yesterday on a conference call with analysts and investors.  First Solar also reported third-quarter net income doubled
to $195 million, or $1.94 a share, from $87.9 million, or $1, a
year earlier. That beat the 95-cent average of 13 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 51 percent to a
record $1.27 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
