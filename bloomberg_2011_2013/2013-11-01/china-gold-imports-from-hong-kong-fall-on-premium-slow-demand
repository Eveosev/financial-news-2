Gold shipments to  China  from  Hong
Kong  fell for a second month after the premium to take immediate
delivery declined, indicating waning physical demand in the
nation poised to become the largest consumer.  Net imports, after deducting flows from China into Hong
Kong, were 109.4 metric tons in September, from 110.2 tons a
month earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations based on data
e-mailed from the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department.
Still, the amount has more than doubled to 826 tons in the first
nine months of the year, the data show.  Gold prices dropped in September for the first loss in
three months amid speculation at the time that the U.S. Federal
Reserve would slow its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases.
The average  premium  that Chinese buyers paid to take gold for
immediate delivery in  Shanghai  fell to $8.97 in September,
compared with $13.57 a month earlier.  “Demand eased a bit in September as investment in China
remained sensitive to the gold price outlook,” said Wang
Weimin, an analyst at Dalian Fortune Futures Co., before the
announcement. “A lower premium was a good indicator that
Chinese investment demand slowed after more sell-offs following
the gold rout in April and in June.”  Gold for immediate delivery in  London  traded at $1,323.91
an ounce at 10:18 a.m. Beijing time. Bullion, which dropped as
low as $1,180.50 an ounce on June 28, has declined 21 percent
this year as investors reduced holdings in  exchange-traded
products  on prospects for a global economic recovery.  Overtaking India  China’s total gold consumption this year may jump 29
percent to reach 1,000 tons, overtaking  India  to become the
world’s largest user, according to the World Gold Council. China
and India combined account for more than half of the world’s
demand, according to the WGC.  Mainland buyers purchased 116.3 tons in September,
including scrap, compared with 131.4 tons in August, data from
the Hong Kong government showed.  China’s purchases in September were 67 percent higher than
the 69.7 tons a year earlier, according to the Hong Kong data.
Mainland China doesn’t publish such data.  Exports to Hong Kong from China were 6.9 tons in September,
according to the e-mail today, compared with 21.3 tons in August
and 28.2 tons in September 2012.  Bullion of 99.99  percent purity on the Shanghai Gold
Exchange fell for the first time in three months in September,
dropping 4.4 percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
