Russian stocks  extended a weekly
advance after Chinese manufacturing improved and OAO GMK Norilsk
Nickel, the world’s biggest producer of the metal, gained.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  rose 0.3 percent to 1,515.15 by the close
in Moscow, taking the weekly increase to 0.7 percent. Oil
producer OAO Surgutneftegas added 1.9 percent to 28.77 rubles.
Norilsk,  Russia ’s largest mining company, snapped three days of
declines, increasing 0.8 percent.  Manufacturing strengthened from  China  to South Korea last
month in a sign that growth risks are abating in Asia and
expansion may pick up this quarter. Russian equities have the
cheapest  valuations  among 21 developing economies monitored by
Bloomberg and the index trades at 4.3 times projected 12-month
earnings, compared with 10.5 times for the MSCI Emerging Markets
Index, which lost as much as 0.7 percent today.  “Russia’s feeling better than Europe and some  emerging
markets  today as there is simply nothing to take profits from,”
Kirill Yankovskiy, director for equity sales at UralSib Capital
in  London , said in e-mailed comments.  The dollar-denominated RTS Index slid 0.4 percent to
1,475.18 today, bringing its decline since the beginning of the
year to about 3.2 percent. That compares with a 2.6 percent
retreat for the MSCI Emerging Markets index.  Industrial metals gained after China’s Purchasing Managers
Index rose to 51.4, the National Bureau of Statistics and China
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said today. That compares
with 51.1 in September and the 51.2 median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
