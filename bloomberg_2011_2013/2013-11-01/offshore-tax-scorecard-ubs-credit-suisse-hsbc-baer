H. Ty Warner , the billionaire creator of Beanie Babies plush toys, pleaded guilty last month to evading taxes on secret Swiss bank accounts that held as much as $107 million.  Warner, 69, is the most prominent defendant in a U.S. crackdown since 2008 on offshore tax evasion that led to charges against about 70 American taxpayers and 30 bankers, lawyers and advisers.  Beanie Baby Billionaire Sentence Comes Amid Tax Leniency The crackdown has led to charges against  UBS AG , the largest Swiss bank; a guilty plea by Wegelin & Co., Switzerland’s oldest private bank; and criminal investigations of 14 Swiss banks. At least 38,000 avoided prosecution by entering a limited amnesty program at the Internal Revenue Service known as the Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program.  Warner owns TY Inc., which makes Beanie Babies, and Ty Warner Hotels & Resorts, which runs the Four Seasons Hotel in New York and other properties. He opened a UBS account in 1996 and transferred $93.6 million in 2002 to a secret Swiss account at Zuercher Kantonalbank.  In 2002, he failed to report his UBS income of $3.2 million to the IRS, and he didn’t file a required Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts, or FBAR. He agreed to pay a civil FBAR penalty of $53.6 million. He faces as many as five years in prison when he is sentenced Jan. 15 in federal court in Chicago.  Cases in the crackdown involve accounts at banks including UBS; Credit Suisse Group AG, Switzerland’s second-largest bank;  HSBC Holdings Plc , Europe’s biggest bank; and Wegelin.  Below is a summary of U.S. federal court cases:  Banks  UBS AG : In February 2009, U.S. prosecutors charged the Zurich-based bank with aiding tax evasion by thousands of U.S. clients.
