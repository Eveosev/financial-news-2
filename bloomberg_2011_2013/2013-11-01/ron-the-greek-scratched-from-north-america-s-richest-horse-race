Ron the Greek, winner of the Jockey
Club Gold Cup, was scratched from the $5 million Breeders’ Cup
Classic when the thoroughbred developed a crack in his right
front hoof from an abscess.  Eleven entries, including favorite Game On Dude, will run
in the Classic, North America’s richest horse race, tomorrow at
Santa Anita Park in Arcadia,  California .  “Ron the Greek’s out; he’s got a quarter crack,” trainer
Bill Mott told reporters. “Long term it’s not a problem, but
he’s not going to run in the Classic.”  The 6-year-old, winner of more than $2.7 million in
earnings, will be able to resume training in two weeks after a
patch is placed on the injury, Mott said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
