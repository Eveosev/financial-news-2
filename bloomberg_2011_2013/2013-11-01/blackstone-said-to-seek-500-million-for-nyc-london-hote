Blackstone Group LP (BX)  hired Eastdil
Secured LLC to sell the leasehold on the London NYC hotel in
midtown Manhattan, two people with knowledge of the matter said.  Blackstone is seeking $500 million for the leasehold, which
has 123 years remaining, according to the people, who asked not
to be named because the details are private.  The private-equity firm bought the leasehold on the 54-story luxury  hotel , formerly known as the Rihga Royal, for $193
million in 2005 and renovated the property, adding a restaurant
and cafe by celebrity chef  Gordon Ramsay . The hotel, at 151 W.
54th St. between Sixth and Seventh avenues, offers views of
 Central Park .  A deal would include a carriage house on 55th Street that’s
connected to the north side of the hotel, the people said.  Peter Rose , a spokesman for New York-based Blackstone,
declined to comment on the planned sale, which was reported
yesterday by the Real Deal. Roy March, chief executive officer
of Eastdil, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail.  Blackstone last month sold the London West Hollywood hotel
for $195 million to Northwood Investors LLC, a private-equity
firm started by John Kukral, Blackstone’s head of real estate
until the end of 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
