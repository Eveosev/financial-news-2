Qunar Cayman Islands Ltd. (QUNR) , the
Chinese travel-booking service controlled by  Baidu Inc. (BIDU) , surged
on its first day of trading after raising $167 million in a U.S.
initial public offering that priced above a marketed range.  Qunar, which means “where to go” in Chinese, jumped 92
percent to $28.75 at 2:17 p.m. in  New York . The company sold
11.1 million American depositary receipts at $15 apiece, higher
than its initial target of $9.50-$11.50, which was later boosted
to as much as $14, according to filings of the Beijing-based
company. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and Stifel
Financial Corp. managed the offering.  The share sale is the second U.S. IPO by a Chinese company
this week to price above its marketed range after  58.Com (WUBA)  Inc,
underscoring investor confidence in Chinese debuts even as Muddy
Waters LLC said Beijing-based security software maker  NQ Mobile
Inc. (NQ)  had inflated sales. Baidu, operator of  China ’s largest
search engine, purchased in 2011 a majority stake in Qunar,
which reported a net loss of $2.8 million in the first six
months this year.  “Short term, we are going to focus on market share as well
as cash flow balance,” Cc Zhuang, chief executive officer and
co-founder of Qunar, said in a phone interview in New York. “We
are trying to build something that can generate long-term
profitability.” Being controlled by Baidu means that “if we
have a new product, we can go through the Baidu search engine
and easily get through to the customers,” he said.  Active Users  Qunar’s sales jumped 75 percent from a year earlier to
358.8 million  yuan  ($58.5 million) for the six months ended June
30, while its net loss narrowed from 64 million yuan a year
earlier, according to the company’s IPO  prospectus .  The number of Qunar’s active web users grew to 31.4 million
for the 12 months through June, from 12.6 million in 2010, the
company said in its filing.  58.Com, which raised $187 million in its IPO yesterday,
priced its sale of 11 million ADRs at $17 apiece, higher than
its initial target range of $13 to $15. Web retailer
LightInTheBox Holding Co. raised $91 million in June, followed
by China Commercial Credit Inc. and Montage Technology Group
Ltd.  To contact the reporters on this story:
