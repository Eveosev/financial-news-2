Jacksonville Jaguars wide receiver
Justin Blackmon was suspended indefinitely for violating the
National Football League’s substance-abuse policy, the team
said.  Blackmon, 23, also was banned for the first four games of
the season for a substance-abuse violation. He will be eligible
to apply for reinstatement before the start of the 2014 season,
the NFL said yesterday in a statement.  “All of us who are a part of the Jaguars family care very
deeply about Justin and his well-being,” Jacksonville General
Manager David Caldwell said in a statement. “That said, he must
be held accountable and accept the consequences.”  Neither the league nor the team specified the nature of
Blackmon’s violation. He pleaded guilty to driving under the
influence last July in  Oklahoma  and also was arrested on a DUI
charge in  Texas  in 2010.  The No. 5 pick in the 2012 draft, Blackmon had 29 catches
this year for 415 yards and one touchdown. The Jaguars are 0-8
this season, the only American Football Conference team without
a victory. The team’s 86 points scored are the fewest in the
NFL. The only other winless NFL team so far this season is the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers (0-7).  To contact the reporter on this story:
