President Narayana Kocherlakota said local leaders in La Crosse,
Wisconsin, view the Affordable Care Act as a “positive step”
in broadening access to low-income households.  “Several organizations” expressed concerns such as the
increased costs that may come with more record-keeping, he said
in the prepared text of remarks given today in St. Paul,
 Minnesota .  The district bank chief didn’t comment on monetary policy
or the economic outlook in the prepared remarks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
