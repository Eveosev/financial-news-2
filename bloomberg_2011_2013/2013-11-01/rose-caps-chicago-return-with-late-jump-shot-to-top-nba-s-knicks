Derrick Rose  capped his first home
game in more than a season by hitting a short baseline jump shot
with five seconds left to give the Chicago Bulls an 82-81
National Basketball Association win against the New York Knicks.  The Knicks had rallied from a 10-point deficit at the start
of the fourth quarter to take an 81-80 lead with 10 seconds
remaining when  Tyson Chandler  made the second of two free
throws.  Rose, who was the NBA’s Most Valuable Player three years
ago and missed all of last season due to a knee injury, was 7-for-23 from the field while leading the Bulls with 18 points.  Carmelo Anthony had 22 points and Chandler had 19 rebounds
for New York, which shot just 36 percent and hurt itself with 15
turnovers. The Knicks, who were best in the NBA last season with
an average of 12 turnovers per game, had 13 turnovers in the
first half last night at Chicago’s United Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
