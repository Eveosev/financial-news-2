China ’s lead market, the world’s
largest, is poised to swing into a deficit in 2014 for the first
time in five years as production of lead-acid batteries boosts
demand, according to Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  The deficit will be 13,000 metric tons, said Feng Juncong,
a senior analyst with the state-backed researcher who’s been
studying the market for almost 30 years.  The glut is easing as smelters shut just as global sales of
cars, whose batteries are the single biggest source of demand,
expand to a record. Dozens of smelters in China have idled
plants as part of government efforts to curb pollution and as
prices in  London  tumbled 11 percent since Feb. 5.  Lead on the  Shanghai  Futures Exchange may reach 15,300  yuan 
($2,510) as demand from battery production is seen to grow by 5
to 6 percent to about 5.02 million tons. Lead traded at 14,475
yuan per ton at 2:51 p.m. in Shanghai and $2,192 a ton on the
London Metal Exchange.  Refined lead consumption in China will grow 6.3 percent to
5.26 million tons next year, while production may rise 5 percent
to 5.25 million tons, Feng said at a conference in Beijing
today.  China’s consumption of zinc, used to galvanize steel, will
grow about 5 percent as Premier  Li Keqiang ’s vow to meet major
economic goals this year will lead to stable growth in
infrastructure and construction, Feng added.  The country’s smelters will import more than 800,000 tons
of zinc concentrates next year, encouraged by relatively high
treatment charges, Feng said.  Refined zinc production in China is forecast to rise 5.8
percent to about 5.5 million tons, while consumption will likely
rise to about 5.93 million tons, Feng said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
