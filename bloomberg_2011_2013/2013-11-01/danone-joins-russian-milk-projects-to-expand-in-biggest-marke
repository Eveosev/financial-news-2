Danone (BN) , the world’s biggest yogurt
maker, said it is joining forces with Russian entrepreneur Naum
Babaev to expand further in the French company’s biggest market.  The Activia maker will provide an undisclosed amount of
financial support to Babaev’s  Damate Group  in the construction
of several milk farms in  Russia ’s Bashkortostan and Tyumen
regions, according to a statement released today. The entire
output of the farms will be sold to Danone factories, it said.  The two projects require combined investments of 14.4
billion rubles ($450 million), Damate has said previously.  The factories will together produce 193,000 metric tons of
raw milk per year.  Russia became Danone’s largest market by sales after the
French company acquired local producer Unimilk in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
