Sony Corp. (6758) ’s credit rating may be
downgraded to junk by Moody’s Investors Service Inc. after the
Japanese electronics company posted a loss and cut its earnings
forecast, signaling that its turnaround effort is faltering.  Moody’s has placed Sony’s Baa3 long-term senior unsecured
bond rating on review for a downgrade, the credit-rating company
said today in a statement. Baa3 is Moody’s lowest investment-grade rating.  The move represents the latest blow for the Tokyo-based
electronics pioneer, which once dazzled consumers with compact
discs, Trinitron color TVs and the Walkman. After years of
losing ground to Asian rivals such as  Samsung Electronics (005930)  Co.,
the company is struggling to mount a comeback under Chief
Executive Officer  Kazuo Hirai .  “The rating actions reflect the slow progress being made in
improving overall profitability,’’ Moody’s said in its
statement. “Weak earnings across the majority of reporting
units suggests the potential for a much longer period of
restructuring and financial weakness than previously expected.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
