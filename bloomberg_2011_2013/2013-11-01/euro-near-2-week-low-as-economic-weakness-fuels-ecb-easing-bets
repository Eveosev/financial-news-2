The euro fell for a fifth day against
the dollar as signs of economic weakness in the single-currency
bloc fueled speculation the  European Central Bank  will cut
 interest rates  as soon as at its meeting next week.  The 17-nation currency lost the most in a week since July
2012 after data yesterday showed the region’s inflation
unexpectedly slowed and the jobless rate climbed to a record.
The dollar gained versus 14 of its 16 major peers as a gauge of
U.S. manufacturing rose to a two-year high.  South Africa ’s rand
slid after the nation’s trade deficit grew more than forecast. A
gauge of currency volatility increased for a second day.  “A disflationary environment, combined with a strong euro,
is a dangerous combination,”  Camilla Sutton , Toronto-based head
of currency strategy at Bank of  Nova Scotia , wrote in a note to
clients. The ECB “will turn far more dovish at its Nov. 7
policy announcement.”  The euro sank 0.7 percent to $1.3487 at 5 p.m. in New York,
extending this week’s slide to 2.3 percent, the most since the
five days ended July 6, 2012. It touched $1.3480, breaching its
50-day moving average of $1.3487. The shared currency declined
0.4 percent to 133.08 yen after sliding to 132.61, the lowest
since Oct. 11. The yen lost 0.3 percent to 98.67 per dollar and
slid 1.3 percent on the week.  Higher Volatility  A measure of price swings among the currencies of Group of
Seven nations rose to a two-week high. JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s G7
 Volatility Index  reached 8.12 percent, the highest since Oct.
15. It dropped to 7.48 percent Oct. 28, the lowest this year.
The 2013 average is 9.37 percent.  The South African rand weakened for a sixth day against the
dollar, the longest stretch of losses in five months, after the
nation posted a trade deficit of 18.9 billion rand ($1.9
billion) in September. Economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast
a gap of 16.4 billion rand.  The currency sank 1.4 percent to 10.1898 per dollar after
falling to 10.2174, the weakest since Sept. 6.  Sweden ’s krona dropped versus all of its 16 major peers
except the rand after a report showed manufacturing expanded
less than forecast. Swedbank Markets said its index of  factory
output  fell to 52 in October from 56 the previous month. A
Bloomberg News survey  predicted  a decline to 54.5.  The krona dropped 0.9 percent to 6.5395 per dollar in its
fifth straight daily loss. The Swedish currency has depreciated
2.3 percent versus the greenback since Oct. 30, the biggest two-day decline since June. It declined 0.2 percent versus the euro
today to 8.8203.  Krone Climbs  Norway’s krone rose to a five-week high versus the euro
after an  index of manufacturing  based on a survey of  purchasing
managers  climbed to 53.6 last month, the highest since May 2012,
damping speculation the central bank will cut borrowing costs.  The krone advanced as much as 0.6 percent to 8.0263 per
euro, the strongest level since Sept. 24, before trading at
8.0543, up 0.2 percent. The currency depreciated 0.5 percent to
5.9716 per dollar.  “Today’s PMIs do not seriously question the Scandi
recovery story,” Christin Tuxen, a senior analyst at Danske
Bank A/S in Copenhagen, wrote in a note to clients. “Overall
growth in the manufacturing sector is accelerating, hence
reducing the risk of a Norges Bank cut. Euro-krone lower is
indeed a natural reaction.”  Fed Stimulus  The dollar extended gains as the  Institute for Supply
Management ’s  factory index  for October climbed to 56.4, the
highest since April 2011, weakening the case for the  Federal
Reserve  to maintain stimulus. Readings above 50 signal growth. A
Bloomberg survey forecast 55.  The Fed said Oct. 30 it would keep purchasing $85 billion
of bonds per month to put pressure on borrowing costs and spur
growth as it awaited more evidence the economy is improving.  The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index gained for a sixth day,
rising 0.4 percent to 1,015.69. It touched 1,016.58, the highest
since Sept. 18.  The euro area’s annual  inflation rate  declined to 0.7
percent last month, the least since November 2009, from 1.1
percent in September, the European Union’s  statistics office 
said yesterday. Unemployment in the region was at a record 12.2
percent in September, separate data showed.  Bank of America Corp., UBS AG and Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc forecast the ECB will cut rates on Nov. 7. BNP Paribas
SA, Societe Generale SA, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Scotiabank
predict a reduction in December, when the central bank will
publish new economic projections. The ECB last lowered its
 benchmark rate  on May 2 to a record 0.5 percent.  ‘Fragile’ Recovery  “The European recovery, which we always knew was a bit
fragile, just looks that much weaker,”  Richard Franulovich , the
chief currency strategist for the northern hemisphere at Westpac
Banking Corp. in New York, said in a phone interview. “As a
result of those numbers from yesterday, there are quite a few
people formally calling for the ECB to ease policy.”  The euro will test support between $1.3450 and $1.3570,
 Jeremy Stretch , head of currency strategy at Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce in  London , said in a phone interview, referring
to technical levels where there may be buy orders.  The euro has slumped 1 percent this week among 10
developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. It was the worst performer after Sweden’s
krona. The dollar strengthened 1.6 percent, while the yen
increased 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
