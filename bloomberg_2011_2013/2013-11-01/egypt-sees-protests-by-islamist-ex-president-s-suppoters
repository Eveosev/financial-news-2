Thousands of Egyptians heeded calls
to join nationwide protests today in a show of support for
former President Mohamed Mursi, whose trial begins Nov. 4.  Al Jazeera television broadcast footage of marches in
Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, with protesters chanting
slogans and carrying banners in support of the ousted Islamist.
The army tightened security around the capital and Giza ahead of
the protests, with armored vehicles deployed at intersections,
the state-run Ahram Online website reported.  Mursi supporters have called for rallies from today until
the trial opens, a day the pro-Mursi alliance has dubbed the
“Day of President’s Steadfastness” and proposed protests
outside Egyptian embassies on the same day. Mursi, who’s been
held at an undisclosed location since his July 3 overthrow by
the military, faces charges including inciting violence that led
to the deaths of opposition demonstrators during his one year
term in office.  Student protests broke out across  Egypt  on Oct. 30, hours
after security forces arrested Essam el-Erian, the deputy leader
of the Brotherhood’s political arm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
