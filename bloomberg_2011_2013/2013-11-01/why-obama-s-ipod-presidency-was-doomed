My colleague Ezra Klein has an  excellent article  in Bloomberg Businessweek about technology in government and why it has so many problems. He contrasts the performance of the Obamacare websites with what’s going on at one particular agency: I think this is absolutely right, but it’s for exactly that reason that I think the quest to create an "iPod presidency” was always doomed. The process that Ezra describes -- the sclerotic process by which bureaucracy and encroaching risk aversion come to block off the arteries of innovation -- is the natural aging process of an organization. It’s why companies like Hewlett-Packard Co. and Xerox Corp. and International Business Machines Corp., which were once radical disruptors, now seem like slow-moving supertankers: hard to capsize but not exactly nimble. You can see the process happening now at firms like Microsoft Corp., and even Apple Inc. And in a decade or so, you’ll see it happening at Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. It’s an inevitable part of the process of aging.  Old organizations definitionally have a lot of longtime stakeholders. And in a sort of ecological process, those stakeholders have been selected for a certain amount of fitness for their environment, which is to say that they are good at doing things the way they have always been done, and they like things the way they are. They are averse to any sort of big change, and they will fight you with every tool at their disposal, from open warfare to passive-aggressively going through the motions on everything you ask them to do. That’s why organizations in crisis frequently need to fire the majority of their staffs to turn things around -- and, more than once, an organization that has done so has found that it’s still stuck with the same corporate culture that wasn’t working before. As sociologist Gabriel Rossman  told me : The CFPB is doing a good thing by taking a radical approach. But it can only do that because it’s a brand-new agency. In 25 years, if the CFPB is still around, I can virtually guarantee that it will have all the turf wars, bureaucratic inertia and so forth that has hobbled the Department of Health and Human Services. Not because government agencies are somehow especially awful, but because every organization calcifies over time. Of course, there is one key difference with government: It doesn’t go away. When a Polaroid Corp. or an Eastman Kodak Co. runs out of creative steam, it fails, and downsizes, and gets replaced by a different company. HHS, on the other hand, is not going to get its job taken over by a lean upstart. Government structure is not quite written in stone -- over the last 10 years, we’ve gotten the Department of Homeland Security and the CFPB. But note that it took the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil, and the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, to make these things happen. And at that, Homeland Security simply replicates much of the old bureaucratic structure of the agencies that were put together under its umbrella. America thinks of itself as being one of the youngest nations in the world. But as far as governments go, we’re one of the oldest: We’ve been operating continuously under the same constitution for more than 200 years now. A certain amount of what  Jonathan Rauch  has dubbed “demosclerosis” was inevitable. And it’s now so far advanced that I doubt we’ll ever have an iPod presidency . . . at least not until an iPod is something that your grandmother used to listen to while she was dancing the Watusi.
