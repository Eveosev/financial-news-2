Spot metallurgical coal in the U.S.
rose on increased demand from European countries, IHS Inc.’s
Energy Publishing said.  Low-volatility coal rose 15 cents to $142.90 a ton, the
Knoxville, Tennessee-based data provider said.  “Several U.S. met coal players are said to be crunching
the numbers and offering cargoes into the pockets of prompt
demand, particularly in  Turkey ,” it said.  IHS Energy Publishing says it surveys buyers and sellers of
coal to determine pricing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
