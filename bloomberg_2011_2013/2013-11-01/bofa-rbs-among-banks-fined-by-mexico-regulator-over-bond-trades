Bank of America Corp. ’s,  Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) ’s and  Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s Mexico units were
among four businesses fined almost 37 million pesos ($2.8
million) combined for government-bond trading that was
“contrary to healthy market practices,” regulators said.  The sanctions related to transactions in 2008, according to
Mexico’s national banking and securities commission, known as
the CNBV. The local unit of Merrill Lynch & Co. also was among
those punished for actions prior to its acquisition by Bank of
America, according to a statement today from the regulator,
which didn’t elaborate on the alleged misconduct.  The banks cooperated with investigators and enacted
measures to avoid similar lapses in the future, according to the
CNBV, which said the transgressions were limited in scope. Other
firms and individuals also have been sanctioned for violations
and haven’t paid, it said.  The Merrill Lynch unit faced the highest fine of more than
23 million pesos, followed by Bank of America at 7.2 million
pesos, RBS at 4.2 million pesos and Barclays at 2.1 million
pesos.  Charlotte , North Carolina-based Bank of America agreed in
2008 to buy Merrill Lynch.  Ed Canaday , a spokesman for Edinburgh-based RBS, declined
to comment, as did Brandon Ashcraft at London-based Barclays and
Bank of America’s Kerrie McHugh.  To contact the reporters on this story:
