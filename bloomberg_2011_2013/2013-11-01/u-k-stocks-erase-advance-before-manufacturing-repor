U.K. stocks  erased their advance as
investors awaited a report on manufacturing growth in Europe’s
third-largest economy.  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  climbed 1.9 percent after people
familiar with the matter said AT&T Inc. has carried out internal
work to prepare for a takeover of Europe’s biggest mobile
carrier.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  lost 3.5 percent after
the state-owned lender said it will set up an internal bank to
house its toxic assets.  Meggitt Plc (MGGT)  tumbled 8.1 percent after
the largest provider of wheels and brakes for military aircraft
cut its sales forecast for the year.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  lost 2.86 points, or less than 0.1
percent, to 6,728.57 at 8:49 a.m. in London, erasing an earlier
gain of as much as 0.4 percent. The equity benchmark has still
risen 0.1 percent this week, its fourth consecutive weekly gain.
The broader FTSE All-Share Index slipped 0.1 percent today,
while Ireland’s ISEQ Index dropped 0.5 percent.  A report at 9:30 a.m. will probably show that Britain’s
 manufacturing industry  expanded at a slower pace in October. The
Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply and Markit
Economics will say that their measure slipped to 56.4 from 56.7
in September, according to the median estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. Readings greater than 50 mean that
activity expanded.  In  China , the official  manufacturing gauge  rose more than
forecast to the highest level in 18 months. The purchasing
managers’ index increased to 51.4 in October from 51.1 a month
earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics and China Federation
of Logistics and Purchasing said in a report. The  median
estimate  in a Bloomberg survey of economists had called for a
reading of 51.2. A PMI from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics also exceeded projections.  A report at 10 a.m.  New York  time may show the Institute
for Supply Management’s  manufacturing index  fell to 55 last
month from September’s reading of 56.2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
