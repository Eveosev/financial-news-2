Eight cases of 2005 Chateau Gruaud
Larose, a Bordeaux second-growth estate, sold for more than $700
each in five trades on Liv-ex in the past month, matching July
and April levels and near its record high reached in February.  Three cases sold for 463 pounds ($743) each, two on Oct. 10
and one on Oct. 11, days after five other cases traded for
between 440 pounds and 452 pounds each, according to data on
Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website. That took the vintage within 3
percent of the 475-pound record it set in February.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index, a benchmark for top Bordeaux
wines, has fallen more than 5 percent since the end of March.
The index tracks first growths on the left bank of the Gironde
estuary. Some other wines, including second growths and those
from right-bank growers, have outperformed it, and a recent
increase to a record level in the number of wines traded on Liv-ex with active bids or offers may be a sign of a revival in
broader investor interest.  “Increased liquidity might suggest that as a whole the
market is becoming more healthy and less narrowly focused,”
Liv-ex said in its Cellar Watch market report for October.  The Oct. 11 price for the Gruaud Larose 2005 vintage was 49
percent above the 310 pounds at which it traded in June 2006
soon after it was released to the market. It ranks as the
estate’s third-highest-priced wine of the past 10 years, lagging
behind only those from 2010 and 2009, according to merchant
prices collated by  Liv-ex  on its Cellar Watch website.  Eighteenth-Century Roots  “I see some change, but on the good side, for Bordeaux,”
David Launay, Gruaud Larose’s sales director, said in an
interview during a visit to London last month. “Bordeaux is a
secure buy.”  Chateau Gruaud Larose, with 80 hectares (198 acres) under
vine, traces its history back to 1757, when Joseph Stanislas
Gruaud owned land in the region. It has been under the control
of the Merlaut family since 1997.  Its vineyards in the Saint-Julien district, just outside
the village of Beychevelle, are 60 percent planted with Cabernet
Sauvignon grapes, 30 percent Merlot, 7 percent Cabernet Franc
and 3 percent Petit Verdot, and alongside its main wine it also
produces a second wine, Sarget de Gruaud Larose.  To contact the reporter on this story:
