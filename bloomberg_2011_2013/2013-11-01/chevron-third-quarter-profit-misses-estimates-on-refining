Chevron Corp. (CVX) , the second-largest
U.S. energy producer by market value, reported third-quarter
profit below estimates as weaker refining margins eroded gains
from higher commodity prices and output from wells.  Net income was $4.95 billion, or $2.57 a share, compared
with $5.25 billion, or $2.69, a year earlier, the San Ramon,
California-based company said in a statement today. The per-share result was 13 cents lower than the $2.70 average of 21
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Chevron warned in an Oct. 9 statement that quarterly profit
had been eroded by “significantly lower” earnings in its so-called downstream business, which includes refining and filling
stations. Maintenance work at the company’s El Segundo,
 California , refinery mostly offset an increase in fuel
production at a separate Chevron plant near San Francisco,
according to the statement.  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John S. Watson is
spending $36.7 billion this year in a push to raise oil and
natural gas production by 1.5 percent to the equivalent of 2.65
million barrels of oil a day. The capital spending budget
represents a 7.3 percent increase from 2012.  Chevron’s stock has increased 11 percent this year,
outperforming the company’s bigger U.S. rival,  Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM) , which has gained less than 3 percent. Today’s statement
was released before the opening of regular U.S. stock trading.
Chevron fell 0.3 percent to $119.96 in New York yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
