Investors holding about $238 million
of tax-exempt bonds used to build parking garages at Yankee
Stadium in New York will receive a $6.9 million overdue payment
on Nov. 15, according to a filing with the Municipal Securities
Rulemaking Board.  The payment from Bronx Parking Development Co. had been due
on April 1. Occupancy of the companyâ€™s garages and lots has
suffered as fans take trains, buses and taxis to see the Major
League Baseball team.  To contact the reporter on this story:
