Magnetar Capital LLC, the hedge fund
that bought about 1,900 rental homes mostly in a suburb of
Dayton,  Ohio , is withdrawing some property tax assessment
requests after seeking the largest cut in the county’s history.  Vinebrook Partners LLC, the management company that
oversees the homes for Magnetar, had asked April 1 to have the
assessed value on 1,218 residences in Montgomery County cut by
49 percent, to $50 million from $98.6 million. The firm has
withdrawn more than 250 appeals at hearings, according to Doug
Trout, director of real estate for the county auditor.  Bloomberg reported last month that Magnetar had bought 1 in
11 homes, or a third of all rentals, in Huber Heights in January
from the widow of Charles H. Huber, the builder who developed
the town in the 1950s. A reduction in property taxes would curb
funding for public schools and town services.  Magnetar spokesman Tony Fratto and Vinebrook co-founder
Daniel Bathon didn’t immediately return calls for comment.  The Dayton Daily News reported the withdrawals yesterday.  Bathon, a former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. investment
banker, said last month the  tax cut  will help them invest more
in the properties, which will increase their attractiveness and
value over time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
