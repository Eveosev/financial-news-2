Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) ,  Australia ’s
largest investment bank, rose to a three-and-a-half-year  high 
after it proposed to distribute to shareholders its stake in
 Sydney Airport  and said first-half profit climbed 39 percent.  Shareholders will be asked to approve a transaction in
which they will receive in February one Sydney Airport security
for each Macquarie share they own, while the group would book a
A$377 million (A$357 million) gain, the bank based in
Australia’s largest city said in a statement today.  The proposal will leave Macquarie without a significant
stake in Sydney Airport, Australia’s biggest, for the first time
since 2002, when a group led by the bank agreed to buy the
state-run facility for A$5.59 billion. Macquarie will have about
1.3 percent stake of the company, down from 16.8 percent now,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The proposed Sydney Airport distribution is a substantial
and welcome capital management initiative, which should be well
received,” Credit Suisse AG analysts led by Sydney-based James Ellis said in a note to investors.  Macquarie  shares  climbed 4.4 percent to A$53.20 at 12:00
p.m. in Sydney on track for the highest close since Feb. 4,
2010. That extended gains for the year to 50 percent. The
benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index was  steady . Sydney Airport shares
 dropped  2.7 percent to A$4.075 giving it a market value of A$8.9
billion.  Profit Surge  Macquarie’s profit for the six months ended Sept. 30 rose
to A$501 million ($474 million) from A$361 million a year
earlier and the bank expects higher profit in the second half,
the firm said in a statement today.  The bank’s “strong balance sheet and excess regulatory
capital” mean it is a good time for the transaction, Chief
Executive Officer  Nicholas Moore  said in the statement.  The security distribution is “a smart way of paying a
special dividend,” said  Morningstar Inc. (MORN)  analyst  David Ellis .  Macquarie’s move to reduce its stake follows a government
plan to set a timeline for construction of a second major
airport in the city. Authorities will identify a preferred site
by early next year, Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss told
Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio Oct. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
