Ethanol dropped as corn touched a
three-year low, reducing costs for distillers.  The biofuel fell on speculation that rain in  South America 
will aid corn planting and help boost global supplies of the
grain. U.S. ethanol  production  rose to the highest level since
June 2012 last week, according to data from the Energy
Information Administration. A bushel of corn yields about 2.75
gallons of ethanol in the U.S.  “They’re making money, but the price of ethanol is
falling,” said Wallace Tyner, an agricultural economist at
 Purdue University  in  West Lafayette , Indiana.  Denatured ethanol for December delivery declined 1.1 cents
to $1.645 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade at 12:50 p.m.
 New York  time. The front-month November contract, which expires
Nov. 5, lost 0.6 cent to $1.778. Futures are down 19 percent
this year.  Gasoline for December delivery dropped 2.18 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $2.5652 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol’s discount to gasoline, based on December
contracts, narrowed 1.08 cents to 92.02 cents a gallon.  Corn for December delivery rose 0.25 cent to $4.285 a
bushel after touching the lowest level for a most-active
contract since August 2010. The December crush spread of corn to
ethanol was 9 cents, little changed from yesterday, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
