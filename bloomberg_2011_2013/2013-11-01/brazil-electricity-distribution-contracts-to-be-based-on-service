President  Dilma Rousseff ’s
administration will try to steer electricity-distribution
contracts to companies with good customer-service records, a
government official involved  discussions about the contracts
said.  A review of the contracts is not intended to cut rates, the
official said. Companies with poor service records or too much
debt may not have their contracts renewed, said the official,
who cannot be named because the discussions are not public.  Energy distribution units from  Centrais Eletricas
Brasileiras SA (ELET3) ,  Cia Energetica de Minas Gerais ,  CPFL Energia SA (CPFE3) 
and  Cia Paranaense de Energia  are among the group of utilities
that have contracts expiring from 2015 to 2017.  Eletrobras, as the state-controlled energy company is
known, has a 15.27 debt to Ebidta ratio, the highest among the
publicly traded utilities that have contracts expiring,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Eletrobras distribution units are not among the top
companies in terms of service, according to the website of the
country’s electricity regulator.  The company said on Oct. 28 that the restructuring plan for
its distribution units is already under evaluation from the
country’s development bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
