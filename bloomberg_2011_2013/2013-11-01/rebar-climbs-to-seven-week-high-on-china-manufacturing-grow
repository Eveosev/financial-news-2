Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
Shanghai rose to the highest in seven weeks, after China’s
manufacturing rose more than estimated in October, underpinning
a recovery in the biggest steel user.  Rebar for delivery in May, the most-active contract by
volume on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, rose as much as 1.2
percent to 3,678  yuan  ($604) a metric ton, the highest intra-day
level since Sept. 13. Futures traded at 3,671 yuan at 10:54 a.m.
local time, up 2.4 percent this week.  The  Purchasing Managers ’ Index was at 51.4, the National
Bureau of Statistics and China Federation of Logistics and
Purchasing said today in Beijing. The reading is the highest
level in 18 months, exceeding 51.1 in September and the 51.2
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 31 analysts.  “Rebar prices are encouraged by the better-than-estimated
PMI gauge and bottoming out because of low inventories,” said
Li Jinlu, an analyst at Yongan Futures Co. in Hangzhou.  Iron ore futures for May delivery on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange  surged 2.1 percent to 941 yuan a ton. The commodity for
immediate delivery at Tianjin port, tracked by the Steel Index,
rose 0.5 percent at $131.90 a dry ton yesterday.  The  spot  price of rebar advanced 0.5 percent to 3,508 yuan
a ton yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
