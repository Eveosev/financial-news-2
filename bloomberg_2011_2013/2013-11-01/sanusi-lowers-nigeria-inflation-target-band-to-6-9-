Nigeria ’s central bank lowered its
inflation target band for next year to 6 percent to 9 percent,
Governor Lamido Sanusi said.  The bank ideally wants to reduce the target range to 5
percent to 8 percent in 2015 and then 3 percent to 6 percent the
year after that, Sanusi said in an interview in Oslo, where he
was attending a Norway-Africa business conference. The timing
and success of that is being complicated by Nigeria holding
elections in 2015, he said.  “There is a general sense now that the central bank has
established its credibility as a  price stability  central bank,”
he said. “We have been able to anchor expectations and we can
anchor them better.”  Policy makers have kept the benchmark  interest rate 
unchanged at 12 percent since November 2011 to support the
currency of  Africa ’s largest oil producer and meet a target of
keeping inflation under 10 percent.  Consumer prices  rose 8
percent in September compared with a year earlier.  Sanusi, 52, has said he won’t seek to renew his term when
it expires in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
