African Bank Investments Ltd. (ABL) ,  South
Africa ’s largest provider of unsecured loans, posted a loss in
the 11 months through August after a 4.6 billion-rand ($458
million) goodwill impairment.  The loss of 4.24 billion rand compares with a profit of
2.82 billion rand a year earlier, the Johannesburg-based lender
said in a statement today. Earnings per share excluding one-time
items fell 89 percent to 39.6 cents, while income from
operations rose 16 percent to 20.1 billion rand.  African Bank, which targets low-income earners with
unsecured credit, increased bad-loan provisions as consumers
struggle to repay debt and said the impairment relates to its
unprofitable Ellerines furniture-retailing business. The bank
starts a 5.5 billion-rand rights offer today.  “The banking unit was negatively impacted by slower
disbursement and advances growth, as well as deteriorating asset
quality with commensurate higher credit impairment charges and
credit life insurance claims,” African Bank said.  African Bank’s stock fell as much as 8.5 percent in
Johannesburg before closing unchanged at 17 rand. The company
will report full-year results on Nov. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
