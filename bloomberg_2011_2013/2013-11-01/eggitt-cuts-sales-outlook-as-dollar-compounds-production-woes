  Meggitt Plc (MGGT) , the largest provider of
wheels and brakes for military aircraft, cut its sales forecast
for the year as production problems affected a division and a
weaker dollar hurt earnings reported in sterling.  Sales this year will grow by low single-digits, the
Christchurch, England-based company said in a statement today.
That compared with a previous forecast of a mid-single-digit
increase. Sales should rise by a mid-single digit rate next year
at constant currency, it said.  The company also took a 20 million pound ($32 million)
provision to reflect a raw material supply shortage. A fix has
been found, including where needed the replacement of parts in
coming years. The full costs of the issue are not known, Meggitt
said. Short-term production problems at Meggitt Sensing Systems
contributed to underlying trading “slightly below
expectations” in the period from July 1 to Oct. 31.  Bank of America cut its rating for the company to neutral
from a buy after the forecast revision.  Meggitt shares advanced 50 percent this year before the
profit warning, valuing the company at 4.5 billion pounds. The
forecast adjustment is the first for Stephen Young who became
chief executive officer six months ago after serving as finance
chief.  Military revenue remained flat, the company said, despite
mandatory spending cut by the U.S. government. The company’s
energy business was affected by the timing of payments on some
contracts, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
