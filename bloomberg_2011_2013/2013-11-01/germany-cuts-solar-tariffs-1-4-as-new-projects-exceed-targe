Germany  will cut feed-in tariffs for
new solar plants by 1.4 percent in November and each of the
following two months after installations were above forecast.  The tariffs, above-market rates paid for solar power, will
be reduced today and on the first days of December and January,
the grid regulator said in a statement. Installations are
slowing and moving closer to a government target of 2.5 to 3.5
gigawatts a year, the regulator said late yesterday.  Germany, the worldâ€™s largest solar market by total
capacity, sets the rates every three months, cutting them by 1
percent a month or more if the pace of installations indicates
annual growth of more than 3.5 gigawatts. About 7.6 gigawatts of
solar panels were installed last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
