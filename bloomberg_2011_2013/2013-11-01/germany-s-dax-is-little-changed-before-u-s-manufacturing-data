German stocks were little changed,
following a second straight monthly advance for the benchmark
DAX Index, as investors awaited data on U.S. manufacturing to
gauge the health of the world’s largest economy.  The DAX fell less than 0.1 percent to 9,031.6 at 9:12 a.m.
in  Frankfurt . The index climbed 5.1 percent in October.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
