The Markit Economics  final index  of
U.S. manufacturing decreased to 51.8 in October from 52.8 the
previous month, the London-based group said today.  The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists
called for a decline to 51.1, with estimates ranging from 50.5
to 52. A reading greater than 50 for the  purchasing managers ’
figure corresponds to expansion. The preliminary October figure
was 51.1.  Manufacturing strengthened from China to  South Korea  last
month in a sign that growth risks are abating in Asia and
expansion may pick up this quarter, reports today showed.  China’s official manufacturing index of purchasing managers
rose to an 18-month high and a measure from HSBC Holdings Plc
and Markit topped projections. HSBC’s reading for South Korea
showed growth for the first time since May and Taiwan’s PMI rose
to 53 from 52. An Australian index also advanced.  In the U.K.,  manufacturing  eased in October from a month
earlier. A measure for  Norway  showed a pickup in growth, while
Switzerland, Sweden and  Denmark  showed slower expansions.  The Markit measure for the U.S. is based on replies from 85
percent to 90 percent of companies in a poll of more than 600
American manufacturers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
