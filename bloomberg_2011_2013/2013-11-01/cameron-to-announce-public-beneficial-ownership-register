The U.K. government should bring its
range of funding plans for small and medium-sized businesses
into a unified program to maximize results, the National Audit
Office said in a report.  Prime Minister David Cameron’s government and the Bank of
England have sought to spur lending to businesses after the
financial crisis led to a credit freeze. Cameron is aiming for
private-sector hiring to offset cuts in public-sector jobs
required by his austerity program and to help power Britain’s
 burgeoning economic recovery.   “Access to finance is a significant and enduring problem
for many small and medium-sized businesses,” Amyas Morse, the
head of the NAO, the government’s spending watchdog, said in an
e-mailed statement today. “But there is work to be done in
terms of managing the schemes as a unified portfolio and
articulating what they are intended to achieve as a whole,”
bringing a “clearer focus on assessing what results can
realistically be delivered.”  Small and medium-sized businesses may need an extra 22
billion pounds ($35 billion) of finance by 2017 on top of
existing funding sources, the NAO said. While the Department for
Business, Innovation and Skills’ Business Bank, which will start
operating next year, re-examined these funding issues, and both
the BIS and the Treasury have teams focused on enterprise
policy, there is no program across government departments,
according to the NAO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
