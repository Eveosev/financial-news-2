Chevron Corp. plans to sell some oil
and natural-gas assets as newly-acquired exploration prospects
in places such as Iraq, Canada and  Australia  take precedence.
Some of the new projects may move to the top of the San Ramon,
California-based companyâ€™s development queue because they
promise richer returns, Chief Financial Officer Pat Yarrington
said during a conference call with analysts today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
