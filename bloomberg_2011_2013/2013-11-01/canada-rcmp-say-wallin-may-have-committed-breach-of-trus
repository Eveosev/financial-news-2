Canadian Senator Pamela Wallin may
have committed a criminal breach of trust and fraud by claiming
ineligible expenses, police allege in court documents.  There are “reasonable grounds to believe” that former
broadcast journalist and Canadian government representative in
 New York  committed “breach of trust in connection with the
duties of her office by making inappropriate expense claims” in
violation of the criminal code, the  Royal Canadian Mounted
Police  said in documents filed in Ontario Provincial Court.  Wallin, who resigned from the Conservative caucus in May,
faces suspension from the upper house of the nation’s
legislature over her expense claims. Former Conservative
senators Mike Duffy and Patrick Brazeau could also be suspended
if the Senate passes a motion introduced last month by
Government Senate leader Claude Carignan.  Wallin  told  the Senate on Oct. 23 that the attempt to
suspend her is “baseless and premature.”  The Senate expenses scandal has dogged Prime Minister
 Stephen Harper  this year and undermined his efforts to keep the
public’s attention on his economic record.  Nigel Wright, a former managing director at Toronto-based
private-equity firm Onex Corp., resigned as Harper’s chief of
staff in May amid a police investigation following the
disclosure he paid about C$90,000 ($86,300) to Duffy to help
cover ineligible expense claims.  Wallin’s office didn’t immediately respond to a telephone
or e-mail message seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
