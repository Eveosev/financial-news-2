Japanese shares fell, with the  Topix
index (TPX)  paring its weekly advance, as earnings reports and
forecasts by companies from Sony Corp. to Mitsui Chemicals Inc.
disappointed investors.  Electronics exporter Sony and Mitsui Chemicals tumbled at
least 8.1 percent after cutting earnings outlooks. Ricoh Co.
fell 6.7 percent after the maker of printers and digital cameras
reported operating profit that missed its forecast. Panasonic
Corp., the maker of Viera televisions, jumped 6.2 percent after
doubling its net-income outlook. Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ltd.,
which makes machinery and ships, surged 7.6 percent as operating
profit beat analyst estimates.  The Topix slipped 0.9 percent to 1,183.03 at the close of
trading in  Tokyo , trimming this week’s gain to 0.4 percent. All
but four of the 33 industry groups retreated. The  Nikkei 225 
Stock Average lost 0.9 percent to 14,201.57. The yen
strengthened 0.5 percent to 97.92 per dollar.  “The winners and losers of this earnings season are
becoming clear to see, and their share prices are reacting
pretty extremely,” said Seiichiro Iwamoto, who helps oversee
the equivalent of $33 billion at Mizuho Asset Management Co.
“Optimism about across-the board benefits from a weaker yen is
starting to wane, and now it’s about which companies can truly
push forward on their own merits.”  The Topix was October’s worst performer among 24 developed
markets tracked by Bloomberg, rising 0.01 percent. Japanese
shares are still the biggest gainers among the markets in 2013
amid optimism Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s policies and
unprecedented monetary easing from the  Bank of Japan  will lead
the country out of deflation. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
gained 4.5 percent last month, with the Stoxx Europe 600 Index
up 3.8 percent.  Sales Surprise  The Topix  traded  at 1.23 times  book value  today, compared
to 2.55 for the S&P 500 yesterday.  More than 1,100 companies on the 1,744-member Topix
announce results in the two weeks through Nov. 7, the peak for
earnings season, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Of the
385 that have  reported  this quarter and for which Bloomberg had
estimates, 61 percent posted sales that beat expectations.  Earnings per share for companies on the gauge are expected
to increase 41 percent from the previous quarter, according to
 analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Sony plunged 11 percent to 1,668 yen, the biggest single
drag on the Topix. The company unexpectedly lowered its full-year profit forecast by 40 percent on stalling demand for TVs
and digital cameras, and as films flopped at the box office.  Mitsui Chemicals dropped 8.1 percent to 239 yen, its
biggest decline since May 23 and the second-biggest drop on the
Nikkei 225. The company slashed its net income forecast for the
year by 80 percent to 1 billion yen, while also reducing its
operating profit outlook by 11 percent.  Ricoh Tumbles  Ricoh (7752)  declined 6.7 percent to 964 yen, the most since June,
after operating profit of 45.9 billion yen missed its own
forecast of 56 billion yen.  Panasonic jumped 6.2 percent to 1,046 yen, its highest
close since April 2011, after doubling its net income forecast
to 100 billion yen, with sales projected to rise to 7.4 trillion
yen.  Sumitomo Heavy surged 7.6 percent to 466 yen, the biggest
jump on the Nikkei 225. The company posted operating profit of
8.4 billion yen for the first half of this fiscal year, beating
the 5.6 billion yen average estimate of three analysts compiled
by Bloomberg.  Seiko Epson Corp. soared 25 percent after the printer maker
more than doubled its full-year net-income outlook.  Futures on the  S&P 500  gained 0.2 percent today. The
measure dropped 0.4 percent yesterday, capping its first two-day
slide in three weeks, on speculation the  Federal Reserve  will
scale back stimulus in coming months.  The Topix’s 30-day historic volatility was at 16.37 today,
down from its five-year median of 19.18. Volume was 4.2 percent
above the 30-day average today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
