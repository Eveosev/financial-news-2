Fab.com Inc., the e-commerce startup
that has been valued at about $1 billion, announced the
departure of co-founder Bradford Shellhammer, who was in charge
of choosing the products sold by the website.  “Bradford feels now is the perfect time in Fab’s lifecycle
and for his career for him to take a step back from Fab and
pursue other adventures,” Chief Executive Officer Jason Goldberg said today in a blog post. Shellhammer will remain an
adviser to the company, he said.  The move follows a round of job cuts last month that
eliminated 101 positions, or about 19 percent of the staff. The
company is shifting away from flash sales -- selling limited
amounts of goods in bursts -- and toward an inventory model that
requires more merchandising expertise.  The startup, which rose to prominence selling quirky home
goods, raised $150 million in June from investors such as
 China ’s  Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700)  Additional funding rounds in July
and August brought the total amount raised to at least $325
million.  “Roles and people change,” Goldberg said today.
“Business models evolve. But our motivation at Fab stays
constant: to brighten peoples’ lives with design.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
