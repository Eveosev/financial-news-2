Wheat futures traded in South  Africa 
reached the highest level since December, extending a third
straight monthly climb.  Wheat for delivery in December climbed 1.1 percent to 3,537
rand ($349) a metric ton by the close on the South African
Futures Exchange in Johannesburg. That was the highest
settlement since Dec. 11 for the contract, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg, following October’s 1.7 percent gain.  South Africa, a net importer of wheat, is sub-Saharan
Africa’s largest producer of the grain after  Ethiopia  and the
region’s biggest buyer after Nigeria and Sudan, according to
U.S. Department of Agriculture data.  White corn for delivery in December gained 0.2 percent to
2,401 rand a ton. The yellow variety for the same delivery month
dropped 0.2 percent to 2,306 rand a ton.  South Africa  is the continent’s biggest corn producer. A
meal made from white corn is a staple food in the nation and the
yellow variety is mostly fed to animals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
