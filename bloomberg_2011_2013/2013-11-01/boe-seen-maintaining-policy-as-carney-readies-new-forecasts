The Bank of England will probably
keep  interest rates  and its asset-purchase program unchanged
next week as Governor  Mark Carney  prepares to present new
forecasts after the strongest economic growth since 2010.  The nine-member Monetary Policy Committee will keep the
 benchmark rate  at a record-low 0.5 percent, while the bond-purchase plan will stay at 375 billion pounds ($598 billion),
according to two Bloomberg News surveys. The bank will announce
the decisions at noon in London Nov. 7.  Economic expansion  accelerated to 0.8 percent in the third
quarter, while jobless claims are falling. Officials may raise
their growth projections this month and cut the time in which
they expect unemployment to reach the 7 percent threshold that
will prompt them to consider a rate increase.  “It is a stone-dead certainty that the Bank of England
will keep interest rates at 0.5 percent,”  Howard Archer , an
economist at IHS Global Insight in London, said in a research
note. “It seems highly likely that the November Inflation
Report will see a lowering of the Bank of England’s unemployment
forecasts, which will open the door to the bank starting to
raise interest rates before mid-2016.”  Carney will present the forecasts at a press conference in
London on Nov. 13.  To contact the reporters on this story:
