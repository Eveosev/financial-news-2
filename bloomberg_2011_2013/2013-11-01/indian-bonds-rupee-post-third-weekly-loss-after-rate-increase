India ’s 10-year government bonds and
the rupee fell for a third week after the nation’s central bank
increased borrowing costs for the second time in less than two
months to curb inflation.  Reserve Bank  of India Governor Raghuram Rajan, who has said
containing inflation is his top priority, raised the key
repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 7.75 percent on Oct. 29.
This came after data showed  wholesale prices  rose 6.46 percent
in September, the most in seven months, while consumer-price
gains accelerated to 9.84 percent. The RBI today auctioned debt
maturing between 2020 and 2041.  The yield on the 7.16 percent government notes due May 2023
climbed 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, this week to
8.70 percent at the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, prices from the
RBI’s trading system show. The rate rose eight basis points
today.  The rupee weakened 0.4 percent from Oct. 25 and 0.4 percent
today to 61.73 per dollar, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Inflation concerns do remain in the market,” said  Paresh Nayar , head of money-market and currency trading at FirtRand
Ltd. in Mumbai. “I’d expect the 10-year yield to trade between
8.4 percent and 8.8 percent until December.”  The RBI expects wholesale-price inflation to remain higher
than current levels during most of the rest of the fiscal year
through March 2014, with consumer prices staying around or above
9 percent, it said Oct. 29. The central bank also cut its
 economic growth  forecast for the year to 5 percent from 5.5
percent.  Rate Swaps  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose five basis
points this past week to 8.43 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. It rose three basis points today.  One-month implied volatility in the rupee, a gauge of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
dropped 150 basis points, or 1.50 percentage points, this past
week to 10.18 percent. It jumped 53 basis points today.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards fell 0.4 percent today
to 63.16 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Offshore
non-deliverable contracts declined 0.8 percent to 63.49.
