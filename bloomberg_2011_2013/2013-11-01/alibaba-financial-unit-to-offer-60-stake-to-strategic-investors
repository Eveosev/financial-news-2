The financial affiliate of Alibaba
Group Holding Ltd.,  China ’s largest e-commerce company, said it
plans to offer a 60 percent stake to strategic investors.  Alibaba Small & Micro Financial Services Group, the holding
company of third-party payment system Alipay.com, plans to offer
its workers the remaining 40 percent share, according to a
statement on Alipay’s official microblog yesterday. Alipay split
from Alibaba Group three years ago.  Alibaba, founded by billionaire Jack Ma, is expanding into
financial services. Alipay in June started offering fund
products on a platform called Yu’E Bao, which translates as
“leftover treasure.” Ma’s stake in Alipay’s holding company
won’t be higher than his holding in Alibaba Group, according to
yesterday’s statement  The new ownership structure will spread equity to a broader
worker base and give an incentive to employees, spokesman John Spelich said by phone yesterday.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
