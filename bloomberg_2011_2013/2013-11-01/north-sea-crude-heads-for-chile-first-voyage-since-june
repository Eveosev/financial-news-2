The Front Odin crude tanker left a
U.K. North Sea terminal today for  Chile , the first to ply that
route in four months, according to ship-tracking data on
Bloomberg.  The vessel left the Ekofisk crude loading terminal in
Teesside and is headed for the Chilean port of Quintero, the
data show. Trafigura Beheer BV chartered the suezmax, able to
haul 1 million barrels of crude, according to five shipbrokers
reports including JGO Shipbrokers AS.  Front Odin is the first ship to carry a major North Sea
crude grade to Chile since June 26, when the tanker Sabine left
Forties terminal Hound Point for the port of San Vicente,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ekofisk is one of four grades setting the global benchmark
Dated Brent, which is used to price more than half of the
world’s oil. The Norwegian grade is delivered by pipeline to the
Teesside terminal in northeast  England , where it is loaded onto
tankers.  Chile’s state-run Empresa Nacional del Petroleo is the
buyer of the crude, according to four people who participate in
the market, asking not to be identified because the information
is confidential. Enap operates the 104,000 barrel-a-day
Aconcagua refinery, south of the port of Quintero, and the
116,000 barrel-a-day Bio Bio plant, according to the company’s
website.  Victoria Dix, a Trafigura spokeswoman in Geneva, declined
to comment on the matter. Enap officials in Santiago, where it
is a bank holiday today, weren’t available for comment when
called by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
