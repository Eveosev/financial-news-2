The U.S. will sell Israel six V-22
Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft made by  Boeing Co. (BA)  and  Textron Inc. (TXT) ,
Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said.  The transaction will mark the first international sale of
the aircraft that takes off and lands like a helicopter and
flies like a conventional airplane. The Marine Corps and U.S.
Air Force special operations pilots fly versions of the Osprey.  “I have directed the Marine Corps to make sure this order
is expedited,” Hagel said in remarks prepared for the Anti-Defamation League’s  Centennial Dinner  in  New York  tonight.
“That means Israel will get six V-22s out of the next order to
go on the assembly line.”  The Pentagon said earlier this year that the U.S. was
offering to sell an unspecified number of Ospreys as part of a
package that included aerial refueling tankers, precision anti-radar missiles and air defense radar. Details of the other
systems haven’t been announced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
