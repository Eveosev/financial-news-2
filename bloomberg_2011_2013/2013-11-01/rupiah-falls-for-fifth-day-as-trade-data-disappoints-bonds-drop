Indonesia ’s rupiah fell, poised for
the worst week since August, as data today showed the nation’s
trade balance unexpectedly swung back to a deficit in September.
Government bonds declined.  The shortfall was $657 million, compared with a revised $72
million excess in August and the $96 million surplus estimated
by economists in a Bloomberg survey. Exports slid 6.9 percent,
declining for an 18th month.  Consumer-price gains  eased to 8.3
percent last month, from 8.4 percent in September, a separate
report showed today. The rupiah plunged 14 percent in the third
quarter as inflation surged to a four-year high.  “This shows the August surplus was temporary and that the
trade deficit is probably going to be sustained in the coming
months, while the current-account deficit will remain until
mid-2014,” said  Gundy Cahyadi , an economist at DBS Group
Holdings Ltd. in  Singapore . “The inflation number shows that
the panic a few months ago was excessive.”  The rupiah slid 0.9 percent to 11,373 per dollar as of 9:59
a.m. in Jakarta, prices from local banks show. The currency has
fallen every day this week to drop 3.1 percent from Oct. 25, the
most since the five days ended Aug. 23. It gained 2.7 percent
last month in the second-best performance among 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg, trailing only  Malaysia ’s
ringgit.  Most Asian exchange rates declined today after data showing
an improvement in U.S. business activity spurred speculation the
Federal Reserve may start to taper stimulus that has buoyed
 emerging markets  as soon as December.  Forwards, Bonds  In the offshore markets, one-month non-deliverable forwards
fell 1.2 percent to 11,170 per dollar, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. They touched 11,183, the weakest level
since Oct. 11, and were 1.8 percent stronger than the onshore
spot rate. A  fixing  used to settle the contracts was set at
10,902 yesterday, from 10,862 on Oct. 30, according to the
Association of Banks in Singapore.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the exchange rate used to price options, climbed 32 basis
points, or 0.32 percentage point, to 13.09 percent.  The yield on the nation’s 5.625 percent bonds maturing in
May 2023 advanced two basis points to 7.49 percent, the highest
level since Oct. 17, prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association show. The yield rose 50 basis points this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
