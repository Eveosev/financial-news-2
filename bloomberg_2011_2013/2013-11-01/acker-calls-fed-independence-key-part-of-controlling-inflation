Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond
President  Jeffrey Lacker  said the “Great Inflation” of the
late 1960s to early 1980s underscored the era’s key lesson that
the Fed must remain independent from political pressures.  Containing price increases required “tough actions” and
continuing to do so “rests ultimately on the credibility of
government commitments to keeping inflation low,” Lacker said
today in remarks prepared for delivery in Philadelphia. He
didn’t discuss his economic outlook or current monetary policy.  “A measure of central bank independence proved invaluable
in the fight against inflation,” Lacker said. “Institutional
arrangements that helped insulate the central bank’s setting of
the policy rate from partisan electoral pressures while
clarifying accountability for macroeconomic performance allowed
the central bank to focus on longer-run objectives.”  Lacker, 58, has opposed additional stimulus and doesn’t
have a vote on monetary policy again until 2015. He became
president of the Richmond Fed in 2004 after five years as
director of the regional bank’s  research department . He spoke
today to the Global Interdependence Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
