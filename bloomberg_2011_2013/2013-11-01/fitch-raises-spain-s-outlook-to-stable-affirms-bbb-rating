Fitch Ratings  raised its outlook on
Spain’s rating to stable from negative, saying the nation’s
overhaul of banks has “advanced well” and financing conditions
have improved.  The company affirmed its BBB rating in a statement in
London yesterday, leaving the country at the second-lowest
investment grade. Spain has improved its “policy track
record,” with improvements to its labor market, pension system
and budget, it said.  Spain emerged from a more than two-year recession in the
third quarter and the main Ibex 35 stock index has risen about
21 percent this year as foreign investors return to the market.
The country first lost its top  credit rating  at  Standard &
Poor’s  in 2009 and hasn’t been upgraded by any of the three main
rating companies since. Moody’s Investors Service and S&P rate
Spain one step from junk.  Fitch said the recovery from recession came sooner than it
had forecast, and the adjustment from a current account deficit
to surplus has been faster than expected. The economy will
remain weak, growing 0.5 percent in 2014, it added, less than
the government’s 0.7 percent estimate.  “Medium-term growth prospects are weak, all sectors of the
economy remain very indebted and unemployment is exceptionally
high,” Fitch said. Spain’s  unemployment rate  was 26 percent in
the third quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
