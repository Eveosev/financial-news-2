By Marci Jacobs  Nov. 1 (Bloomberg) -- Genworth Financial Inc., the
guarantor of home loans in the U.S. and Canada, predicted a
dispute about mortgages will cost the insurer “significantly
less” than the $834 million sought by  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)   The case focuses on loans backed by Genworth, the insurer
said in a filing today. The company said last year that Bank of
America was seeking “in excess of $834 million” plus punitive
damage tied to denied claims. Mortgage insurers cover losses
when homeowners default and foreclosures fail to recoup lenders’
costs. Guarantors like Genworth can reject claims when they
believe policies were sold based on false information.  Bank of America Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan 
is working to resolve legal disputes after spending more than
$45 billion on litigation, settlements and refunds for investors
to compensate for shoddy mortgage practices, including those at
Countrywide Financial Corp. Richmond, Virginia-based Genworth is
in talks with Bank of America to resolve the clash, the insurer
has said.  The discussions involve “a potential resolution of
certain, and potentially all, aspects of the disputes,”
Genworth said today in a regulatory filing. “We currently
believe we may be able to resolve this matter for significantly
less than $834 million, the previously-disclosed amount of
claimed damages.”  Al Orendorff, a spokesman for Genworth, declined to
comment, as did  Charlotte , North Carolina-based Bank of
America’s  Dan Frahm .
