JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s Core Bond Fund
reported a $2.3 billion withdrawal this week that spurred the
biggest weekly outflow from U.S. investment-grade debt funds
since June.  The fund’s net assets dropped 9.2 percent to $22.38 billion
on Oct. 28, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Investment-grade funds reported a $2.67 billion outflow during the past
week, with most of it coming from one fund,  Bank of America
Corp. (BAC)  credit strategists Hans Mikkelsen and Yuriy Shchuchinov
said in an Oct. 31 report, citing data from EPFR Global.  The withdrawal reported “was likely a one-off event and no
signal of a broader rotation out of high-grade bond funds,” the
analysts wrote.  Investment-grade bonds in the U.S. gained 1.5 percent in
October as speculation mounted that the  Federal Reserve  will
maintain its $85 billion of monthly asset purchases through
March. Companies have sold $991.4 billion of the debt so far
this year, on pace for the most ever, from $945.4 billion during
the same period last year, Bloomberg data show.  The  JPMorgan Core Bond Fund (WOBDX)  was started on Dec. 31, 1983,
and focuses on investment-grade notes with medium-term
maturities, according to the data. It had 25 percent of its
assets in corporate bonds and 55.8 percent in mortgage debt as
of Aug. 31, Bloomberg data show.  Gregory Roth, a spokesman for J.P. Morgan Asset Management,
declined to comment on the nature of the outflow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
