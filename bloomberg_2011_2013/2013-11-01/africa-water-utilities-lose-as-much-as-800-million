African water companies lose as much
as $800 million a year, or about 35 percent of total production,
because of leaks, fraud and unpaid bills, according to the
African Water Association.  As much as 50 percent of the water produced in some African
nations is never accounted for, Sylvain Usher, the secretary-general of the Abidjan, Ivory Coast-based  group , said Oct. 30 in
an interview in Abidjan. The organization collects data on 100
private and government utilities in 40 African nations.  Africa’s population will rise 66 percent to 1.2 billion
people by 2050, putting a strain on the world’s poorest region,
which is already struggling to meet water and sanitation metrics
set by the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. Most of
the waste is because of aging equipment and poor management of
facilities, Usher said. Utilities need to use more meters and
improve reading of the existing ones to reduce costs, he said.  “Rampant urbanization is driving governments to try to
extend their infrastructure, but they aren’t replacing existing
equipment,” Usher said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
