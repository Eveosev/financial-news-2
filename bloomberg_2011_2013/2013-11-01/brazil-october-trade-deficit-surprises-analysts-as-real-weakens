Brazil  reported a  trade deficit  last
month as oil imports surged, surprising analysts who forecast a
surplus. The real depreciated against the  U.S. dollar .  Brazil posted a $224 million deficit in October on $22.8
billion in exports and $23 billion in imports, including an 82
percent surge in foreign purchases of oil and derivatives, the
Trade Ministry said in a report today. Analysts polled by
Bloomberg forecast a $1.2 billion surplus. The real fell 0.8
percent to 2.2568 per dollar at 5:08 p.m. local time.  “The deficit is one factor putting pressure on the real,”
Reginaldo Siaca, an exchange manager with Advanced Corretora de
Cambio, said about the real’s depreciation. “‘Historically this
occurs in Brazil at the end of the year when there’s an increase
in people buying dollars.”  Oil imports, which grew last month during refinery
maintenance, will slow toward the end of the year on increased
domestic production, Foreign Trade Secretary Daniel Godinho told
reporters in Brasilia today. Brazil may post a  trade surplus  in
oil in the next two months before the total  trade balance 
improves in 2014, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
