Wheat fell to the lowest level in
five weeks and headed for the biggest weekly loss since June on
expectations  India  will increase exports, adding to record
global supply. Corn traded near a three-year low.  The contract for December delivery lost as much as 0.1
percent to $6.6675 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
lowest since Sept. 25, and traded at $6.675 by 9:59 a.m. in
 Singapore . Prices are set to drop 3.4 percent this week, the
most since the period ended June 28.  Futures tumbled 14 percent this year as the  U.S. Department
of Agriculture  estimated global production will climb 8.2
percent to a record 708.9 million tons. The International Grains
Council yesterday predicted the world harvest will jump to 696.4
million tons from 654.9 million tons a year earlier. India cut
its minimum export price to $260 a ton from $300 on Oct. 30 to
reduce state reserves that are more than double normal needs.  “The wheat market continued to focus on the formal
reduction in Indian wheat export prices and the likely bearish
influence this will have,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist
at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia , wrote in a note today. “U.S.
wheat export sales have already started to seasonally decline.
And the International Grains Council raised their estimate of
world wheat production.”  About 16.3 million bushels of U.S. wheat were inspected for
 export  in the week ended Oct. 24, down from 20.6 million a week
earlier, the USDA said Oct. 28. The country is the world’s
biggest shipper.  Corn for December delivery was little changed at $4.28 a
bushel after dropping to $4.27 yesterday, the lowest since
August 2010. Prices are heading for a second weekly loss.
Soybeans for delivery in January advanced 0.3 percent to
$12.6975 a bushel, trimming this week’s 1.8 percent decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
