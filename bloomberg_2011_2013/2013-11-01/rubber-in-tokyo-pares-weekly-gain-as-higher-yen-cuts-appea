Rubber declined for a second day,
paring a weekly advance, as crude oil fell and a stronger
Japanese currency cut the appeal of yen-denominated futures.  The contract for delivery in April on the  Tokyo  Commodity
Exchange lost as much as 1.3 percent to 258.1 yen a kilogram
($2,626 a metric ton) and traded at 259.5 yen at 10:44 a.m. The
drop pared gains for the most-active contract to 1.1 percent
this week. Futures fell 1.5 percent last month.  The yen advanced to 98.21 per dollar, extending a rally for
a second day after the  Federal Reserve  maintained its $85
billion in monthly bond purchases Oct. 30. West Texas
Intermediate oil traded near a four-month low even after data
showed today manufacturing in  China  rose more than estimated.  “A lack of support from the currency and energy markets
pressured rubber,” said Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at
research company JSC Corp. in Tokyo.  A Chinese manufacturing gauge increased to an 18-month high
in October as output strengthened, adding to evidence the
nation’s economic recovery is sustaining momentum. China is the
world’s largest rubber consumer.  The  Purchasing Managers ’ Index was at 51.4, the National
Bureau of Statistics and China Federation of Logistics and
Purchasing said today in Beijing. That compares with 51.1 in
September and the 51.2 median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey of 31 analysts.  Rubber for May delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
rose 0.3 percent to 19,780  yuan  ($3,246) a ton. Thai rubber
free-on-board dropped 0.3 percent to 78.10 baht ($2.51) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
