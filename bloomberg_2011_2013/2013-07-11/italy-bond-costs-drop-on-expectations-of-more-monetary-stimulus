Italy  fell short of its maximum
target at a government bond auction today and demand for its 30-year securities declined after Standard & Poor’s cut the
country’s credit rating this week.  The Rome-based Treasury sold a combined 6.35 billion euros
($8.27 billion) of debt, less than its target of 6.5 billion
euros. Investors submitted bids for 1.3 times the 1.46 billion
euros of 30-year bonds on offer, down from 1.97 times at the
previous auction of similar-maturity debt on Feb. 13. Italy also
auctioned 3.39 billion euros of three-year notes and 1.5 billion
euros of floating-rate securities.  “We expected the auction to be a tad stronger,” analysts
at Newedge Group wrote in a note to clients. “Today’s auction
was decently covered but we suspect market dealers remain
cautious as the economic outlook is very fragile.”  Italy’s benchmark  10-year bond  dropped for a fourth day,
reversing a gain before the sale. The yield climbed six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 4.51 percent at 4:28 p.m.
in Rome after dropping as much as 10 basis points.  The  30-year bonds  due in September 2044 were sold at an
average yield of 5.19 percent, compared with 5.07 percent in
February. The notes due in May 2016 were priced to yield 2.33
percent, versus 2.38 percent at the previous auction on June 13.
The floating-rate debt due in November 2018 was auctioned at
2.68 percent, compared with 2.61 percent on June 13.  Rating Cut  S&P this week cut Italy’s credit rating to BBB, or two
levels above junk, from BBB+, citing expectations for a
weakening in economic prospects and the nation’s impaired
financial system.  The outlook on the rating remains negative, the New York-based ratings company said in a statement on July 9. S&P
analysts said even with unprecedented easing by the European
Central Bank, real interest rates for non-financial companies in
Italy exceed the level before the financial crisis.  “The rating action reflects our view of a further worsening
of Italy’s economic prospects coming on top of a decade of real
growth averaging minus 0.04 percent,” S&P said. “The low growth
stems in large part from rigidities in Italy’s labor and product
markets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
