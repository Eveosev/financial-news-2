The biggest group of Dutch property
brokers called on the government and banks to help revive the
country’s housing market by easing the terms on debt that
homeowners take on when they sell properties for less than they
owe on their mortgages.  The government this year introduced measures that allow
underwater property owners to deduct costs and interest on loans
that cover the remainder of a mortgage when their house is sold.
That period should be extended to 20 years from 10 years, the
NVM trade group  said  in a statement today.  Prime Minister  Mark Rutte ’s coalition government is
struggling to find ways to spark a sluggish housing market while
reining in household debt levels that are among  Europe ’s
highest.  House prices  have dropped by 20 percent since 2008 and
will continue to fall for another two years, according to
central bank forecasts.  Banks could help boost the market by improving the terms of
the loans, which are currently treated as unsecured credit that
commands high  interest rates , NVM said. More than 30 percent of
Dutch residential mortgages are underwater, the country’s
central bank said in March.  “A substantial part of home owners who are underwater
should be able to move on in the market based on their income,”
said Ger Hukker, chairman of the Nieuwegein-based group. “If we
would take small, simple measures like these, transaction flows
could easily improve by 10 percent from now.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
