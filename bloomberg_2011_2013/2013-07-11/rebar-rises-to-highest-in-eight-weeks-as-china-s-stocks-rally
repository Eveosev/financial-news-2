Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
Shanghai advanced to the highest in more than eight weeks after
a rally in the local stock market buoyed sentiment.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose as much as 0.7 percent to 3,663 yuan ($597) a
metric ton. That’s the highest since May 14 for a most-active
contract. Futures traded at 3,645 yuan at 10:05 a.m. local time.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  climbed 2.2 percent yesterday
while the CSI 300 Index rose 2.8 percent on speculation the
government will take measures to support economic growth after
an unexpected drop in exports. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies traded in  Hong Kong  gained 1.1
percent.  “Sentiment in the stock market has a big impact on
rebar,” said Wu Zhili, an analyst at Shenhua Futures Co. in
Shenzhen. “Possible cuts in output induced by environmental
concerns and perhaps more demand for building materials in the
second-half of the year also helped.”  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port rose 0.2
percent to $123.90 a dry ton yesterday, according to The Steel
Index Ltd.  The average spot price for rebar in China fell 0.2 percent
to 3,406  yuan  a ton yesterday, according to data from Beijing
Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
