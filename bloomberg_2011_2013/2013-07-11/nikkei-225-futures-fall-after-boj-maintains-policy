Most Japanese shares fell, with the
 Topix (TPX)   index  dropping for a second day, as paper and electronics
makers led losses among the gauge’s 33 subsectors.  Hokuetsu Kishu (3865)  Paper Co. slid 2.3 percent as the sector
posted the biggest decline on the Topix.  Chiyoda Co. (6366) , which
operates shoe stores, sank 8.4 percent after reporting a decline
in first-quarter profit. Photocreate Co. surged 144 percent from
its initial public offering price after the photographic-service
provider went untraded on its debut yesterday. Developers and
energy explorers climbed the most on the gauge.  The Topix fell less than 0.1 percent to 1,194.77 at the
close in  Tokyo  after swinging between a 0.2 percent gain and a
1.2 percent loss. Volume was 15 percent below the 30-day
average. The index gained 4.8 percent last week, bringing its
increase over three weeks to more than 12 percent, the most
since April 2009. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average added 0.4 percent
to 14,472.58.  “There’s no clear direction in the market at all,” said
Isao Kubo, a Tokyo-based equity strategist at Nissay Asset
Management Corp., which oversees about $61 billion. “I think
you can be bullish on the Japanese market, but shares have risen
fast recently and investors may be being cautious.”  After plunging as much as 18 percent from a May 22 high,
the Topix has rebounded amid optimism Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
will push through economic reforms following elections on July
21. Investors today weighed a  Bank of Japan  policy decision and
economic upgrade, comments from  Federal Reserve  Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke , a strengthening yen and surging machinery orders.  BOJ Policy  The BOJ today stuck with a pledge to expand the monetary
base by 60 to 70 trillion yen ($710 billion) per year, in line
with the forecasts of all 20 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg
News , a statement today showed. The bank raised its assessment
of the economy, referring to a “recovery” for the first time
since before the 2011 earthquake.  “The BOJ decision was within market expectations,” said
Takahiro Nakano, a Tokyo-based senior strategist at Mizuho Trust
& Banking Co., a unit of Japan’s third-largest bank by market
value. “Upgrading the economic outlook met the market
consensus, too.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 1 percent
today. The gauge closed little changed yesterday as investors
analyzed minutes from the Federal Reserve’s last meeting for
signs of when the central bank might slow the pace of stimulus.  Fed Chairman Bernanke yesterday called for maintaining
loose policy, which pushed the dollar down against its peers.
The yen gained 0.7 percent to 99.03 against the greenback as of
4:08 p.m. in Tokyo after rising 1.5 percent yesterday.  Mixed Performance  Companies that do business in the U.S. were mixed. Honda
Motor Co., a carmaker that gets 47 percent of revenue in  North
America , dropped 0.5 percent to 3,790 yen.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , an
automaker that relies on the region for 30 percent of sales,
added 0.2 percent to 436 yen.  Japan’s  machinery orders   rose  10.5 percent in May from
April, the Cabinet Office said today, topping the 1.9 percent
gain estimated by 29 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Machinery
orders are an indicator of  capital spending .  Data (JSIHSTCK)  released today showed foreigners bought the most
Japanese stocks in seven weeks. It’s the third straight week of
net purchases, the longest streak since April 12.  The Topix Pulp & Paper Index fell 0.9 percent, halting a
five-day rally. Hokuetsu Kishu, Japan’s third-largest paper
company by market value, dropped 2.3 percent to 426 yen.  Daio
Paper Corp. (3880) , the fourth-biggest, lost 2.1 percent to 604 yen.  Photocreate Surges  Chiyoda (8185)  slumped 8.4 percent to 2,405 yen, the most since
October 2008, after the footwear retailer said its quarterly net
income dropped 7.6 percent to 2.2 billion yen.  Photocreate, which provides photography services for sports
events, festivals and concerts, jumped 144 percent to 4,070 yen
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Mothers market.  The Topix traded at 1.27 times book value today, compared
with 2.44 times for the S&P 500 and 1.66 times for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index yesterday. The gauge’s 30-day  historic
volatility  was at 34.95 today, retreating from its July 2 high
of 43.22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
