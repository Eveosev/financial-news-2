HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s largest
bank, said it will keep its Monaco private bank after reviewing
interest to buy the unit.  HSBC is committed to global private banking as one of its
four businesses, the London-based bank said today in a
statement. A unit of Safra Group approached HSBC to buy the
Monaco unit, which the Safra family once owned, three people
familiar with the matter said last month.  The Monaco unit may be valued at $600 million to $700
million, one of the people said, asking not to be identified as
the details are private. HSBC also made informal approaches to
potential buyers for parts of its Swiss private bank, one of the
people said.  HSBC has attracted scrutiny from governments over its
operations in low-tax jurisdictions, with U.K. authorities
saying last year that they were acting on information about
accounts at the bank’s Geneva office.  The bank bought the Monaco private-bank businesses in 1999
through its $9.85 billion acquisition of Edmond J. Safra’s
Republic  New York  Corp. and Safra Republic Holdings SA. Safra
died in a Monaco fire later that year.  -- Editors: Jon Menon, Simone Meier  To contact the reporter on this story:
