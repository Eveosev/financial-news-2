Billionaire investor  Carl Icahn , in
a bid to force Michael Dell to sweeten his $24.4 billion buyout
offer for  Dell Inc. (DELL) , said he’ll come up with a higher bid for
the PC maker by tomorrow morning.  “I do think Dell is worth a great deal more than the
$13.65” Michael Dell is offering, Icahn said today on Bloomberg
Television’s “Street Smart” with Trish Regan.  Icahn, who holds an 8.7 percent  stake  in Dell, has been
agitating for months to try to force Michael Dell and buyout
partner Silver Lake Management LLC to sweeten their proposal.
His latest plan would offer Dell shareholders $14 a share or the
ability to retain equity in a publicly traded portion of the
company -- rather than the buyout group’s deal that takes all
the shares off the table for outside investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
