Alkane Energy Plc (ALK) , the U.K. producer
of electricity from coal-mine methane, is on the hunt for
partners to explore for shale gas at its licenses in central and
northern  England .  “We’re starting conversations,” Chief Executive Officer
Neil O’Brien said today in an interview in  London , declining to
name the potential investors. “We’re talking to people about
how to extract value from our licenses.”  The U.K. government is preparing tax breaks for shale
drillers as it seeks to cut reliance on imports and replace
depleted North Sea reserves. It said last month shale rocks in
the Bowland Basin, which extends from the east to the northwest,
may hold as much as 1,300 trillion cubic feet of gas. A recovery
rate of 10 percent -- similar to fields in the U.S. -- would
give the U.K. enough gas to meet demand for about 47 years.  Alkane had estimated its licenses in Yorkshire and
Nottinghamshire, part of the Bowland, hold 2 trillion cubic feet
of gas, O’Brien said. Following the latest estimates last month,
that could be revised up, he said.  Alkane shares have risen 49 percent this year to their
highest price since 2006. The company is based in
Nottinghamshire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
