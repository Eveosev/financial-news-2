Former  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
executive Fabrice Tourre tentatively lost a bid to keep an e-mail message in which he refers to himself as “Fabulous Fab”
from being introduced as evidence at trial.  U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan, in a
preliminary decision filed yesterday, overruled Tourre’s
objection to the Securities and Exchange Commission using the e-mail in its opening statement. The case, in which Tourre is
accused of misleading investors in a synthetic collateralized-debt obligation, is scheduled to begin July 15.  John “Sean” Coffey, a lawyer for Tourre, argued in court
July 8 that the e-mail, which Tourre sent to his girlfriend in
 London , was personal and had nothing to do with the issues in
the trial.  In the Jan. 23, 2007, e-mail, Tourre wrote: “More and more
leverage in the system, the whole building is about to collapse
anytime now… Only potential survivor, the fabulous Fab ...
standing in the middle of all these complex, highly leveraged,
exotic trades he created without necessarily understanding all
of the implications of those monstruosities!!!”  Coffey didn’t immediately respond after regular business
hours yesterday to a call seeking comment on the tentative
ruling.  The case is SEC v. Tourre, 10-cv-03229, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporters on this story:
