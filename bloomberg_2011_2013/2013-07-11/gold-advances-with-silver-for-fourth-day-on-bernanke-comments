Gold futures rallied to a two-week
high after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
yesterday that the U.S. needs “highly accommodative monetary
policy for the foreseeable future.” Silver also gained.  Bullion slumped 23 percent last quarter as Bernanke said
that the central bank may reduce its $85 billion of monthly
 asset purchases  this year. Minutes of a Fed policy meeting
released yesterday showed many officials wanted to see more
signs of improving employment before backing a cut in bond
buying. The number of Americans filing for  unemployment benefits 
unexpectedly increased to a two-month high in the week ended
July 6, Labor Department figures showed today.  “Gold got a boost after Bernanke gave the impression that
tapering is currently a distant dream,” Carlos Perez-Santalla,
a New York-based broker at Marex North America LLC, said in a
telephone interview. “Today’s data further cements the fact
that the economy has not completely recovered.”  Gold futures for August delivery climbed 2.6 percent to
settle at $1,279.90 an ounce at 1:46 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , the biggest jump for a most-active contract since July 1.
Earlier, the precious metal touched $1,297.20, the highest since
June 24, the last time the price topped $1,300.  Trading was 24 percent higher than the average of the past
100 days for that time of day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Sentiment will now be to the upside, and the market will
be looking for an attempt on $1,300,” David Govett, head of
precious metals at Marex Spectron Group in  London , said today in
a report.  Silver futures for delivery in September advanced 4.1
percent to $19.956 an ounce in New York, a fourth straight gain
and the longest rally since March 8.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery rose 2.9 percent to $1,407.60 an ounce, after
touching $1,413.50, the highest since June 20. Palladium futures
for September delivery gained 0.6 percent to $718.20 an ounce,
after reaching $731.85, the highest since June 17.  To contact the reporters on this story:
