Corn inventories in the U.S., the
world’s top grower and exporter, will gain more than the
government forecast last month as lower feed use and exports
offset a smaller harvest of the rain-drenched crop.  Reserves on Aug. 31, 2014, will total 1.959 billion
bushels, up from 1.949 billion (49.51 million metric tons)
forecast in June, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today
in a  report . Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg were expecting 1.895
billion, on average. USDA said inventories before the start of
this year’s harvest will decline to 729 million bushels, down
from 769 million forecast a month ago and 989 million last year.  Production will total a record 13.95 billion bushels, down
from 14.005 billion estimated a month ago. The average
projection of 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 13.983
billion. Exports are seen at 1.25 billion bushels, down from 1.3
billion forecast last month, while feed and residual use is
estimated at 5.15 billion bushels, a decline from 5.2 billion
forecast in June.  Almost 18 inches (46 centimeters) of rain fell in  Iowa , the
biggest U.S. producer, from March 1 through May 31, the most in
state records that began in 1873. The same three-month period in
 Illinois  to  North Dakota  was the wettest in at least 112 years,
 data  from the National Weather Service show. In each of the past
three years, the USDA’s forecasts for record crops proved wrong
after hot weather in July and August cut yields.  Farmers will harvest 89.1 million acres this year, compared
with 89.5 million forecast last month, the USDA said. Average
yields this year may reach 156.5 bushels an acre, unchanged from
156.5 bushels estimated in June and up from 123.4 bushels in
2012. Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, with a 2012 value of $77.4
billion, government figures show.  Corn futures on the Chicago Board of Trade through
yesterday tumbled 39 percent from a record $8.49 a bushel in
August.  To contact the reporters on this story:
