The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
decreased, according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan declined 4 basis points to 156.5 basis
points as of 8:25 a.m. in  Hong Kong ,  Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  prices show. The measure, which closed at
152.4 last quarter, is down from a one-year high of 177.8 on
June 24, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 2 basis points to
131 as of 10:26 a.m. in Sydney,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  prices
show. The benchmark is set for its lowest close since June 19,
according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index dropped 1.5 basis points to
100.5 as of 9:20 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup Inc.
prices. The gauge is poised for its lowest level since June 12,
CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
