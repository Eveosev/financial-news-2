Rubber climbed from the lowest level
in two weeks after oil in New York surged to a 15-month high,
boosting the appeal of the commodity as an alternative to
synthetic products used in tires.  Rubber for delivery in December on the  Tokyo  Commodity
Exchange advanced as much as 2.1 percent to 239.5 yen a kilogram
($2,408 a metric ton) and traded at 239.2 yen at 10:23 a.m.
Futures reached the lowest settlement since June 27 yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate oil has rallied 11 percent in the
last three weeks and is supported by U.S. crude stockpiles that
tumbled for a second week. Stocks and  commodities  advanced after
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the world’s
biggest economy will continue to need stimulus for the
foreseeable future.  “Rubber chased gains in oil amid speculation that the U.S.
will maintain monetary stimulus to support growth,”  Kazuhiko
Saito , an analyst at broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo, said by phone
today.  Natural rubber imports by China, the world’s largest
consumer, were 130,000 tons in June, the customs agency said
yesterday. That compares with 177,400 tons in May and 163,317
tons a year ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Rubber for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose 1.8 percent to 17,590  yuan  ($2,867) a ton
yesterday. Thai rubber free-on-board fell 1.2 percent to 80.70
baht ($2.58) a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber
Research Institute of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
