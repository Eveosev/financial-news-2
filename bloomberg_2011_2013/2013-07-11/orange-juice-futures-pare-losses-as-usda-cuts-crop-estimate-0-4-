Orange-juice  futures pared losses
after the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  reduced its estimate
for  Florida ’s orange crop by 0.4 percent because of damage from
citrus greening, a bacterial disease.  In the season that started Oct. 1, the state may collect
133.4 million boxes, down from 134 million projected last month,
the USDA said today in a report. On average, analysts and
traders expected the agency to cut the estimate to 133.83
million, a Bloomberg News survey showed. A year earlier, output
was 146.7 million. Florida is the world’s biggest orange grower
after Brazil.  “The report came out on the bullish side. That should
allow the market to build a bit more risk-premium into the
market as we come into  hurricane season ,” Sterling Smith, a
futures trading specialist at Citirgroup Inc. in Chicago, said
in a telephone interview.  Orange juice for September delivery was unchanged at $1.355
a pound at 12:16 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, after
falling as much as 0.9 percent.  Through yesterday, futures jumped 15 percent this year. The
bulk of the Florida orange harvest occurs through July.  Citrus greening starves a tree of nutrients, causing fruit
to shrink and drop prematurely. The disease has been found in
all of Florida’s 32 counties that produce the fruit
commercially. Before today’s report, the agency trimmed the
estimate six times since the start of the current season in
October.  To contact the reporters on this story:
