Japanese  shares  swung between gains
and losses as energy explorers and property developers rose
while paper makers and airlines declined. Volume was low ahead
of a  Bank of Japan  policy decision.  Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. (1662)  led mining shares higher as
crude-oil prices climbed for a third day. Mitsubishi Estate Co.,
 Japan ’s biggest developer, increased 1.8 percent, after earlier
sliding 1.3 percent.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  fell 0.3 percent,
trimming a decline of as much as 1.6 percent, after the yen
pared gains against the dollar.  The Topix fell 0.1 percent to 1,193.78 as of 10:40 a.m. in
Tokyo, after rising as much as 0.2 percent. Volume was 17
percent below the 30-day intraday average. The Nikkei 225 Stock
Average climbed 0.1 percent to 14,443.82. The BOJ will probably
keep bond-buying unchanged as its two-day meeting ends today,
according to a Bloomberg survey.  “While there is largely no change expected from the BOJ,
the yen is unlikely to strengthen strongly, as there is also a
small chance there could be some kind of surprise,” said Yuya Tsuchida, a strategist at Toyo Securities Co. in Tokyo. “But
the stronger yen we had this morning has paused now, so that’s
positive for the market.”  The  Topix (TPX)  gained 4.8 percent last week, bringing its
increase over three weeks to more than 12 percent, the most
since April 2009. After plunging as much as 18 percent from a
May 22 high, the gauge has rebounded amid optimism Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe will push through economic reforms following
elections on July 21.  BOJ Meeting  The BOJ will leave its bond-buying program unchanged today,
according to all 20 economists in a Bloomberg survey. Thirteen
of them see no additional easing in the next six months.  The central bank will also discuss upgrading its assessment
of the country’s economy by using the word “recover” for the
first time in more than two years, people familiar with the
bank’s discussions said earlier this month.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.9
percent today. The gauge yesterday closed little changed as
investors analyzed minutes from the  Federal Reserve ’s last
meeting for signs of when the central bank might slow the pace
of stimulus.  Minutes from the central bank’s June meeting, released
yesterday in  Washington , showed that while several members
judged a reduction in asset purchases “would likely soon be
warranted,” many officials want to see more signs employment is
picking up before reducing bond purchases.  The Topix traded at 1.27 times  book value  yesterday,
compared with 2.44 times for the S&P 500 and 1.66 times for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index. The gauge’s 30-day historic volatility
was at 34.97 today, retreating from its July 2 high of 43.22.  To contact the reporters on this story:
