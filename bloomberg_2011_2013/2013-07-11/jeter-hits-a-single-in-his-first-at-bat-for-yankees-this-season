New York  Yankees captain  Derek Jeter 
had an infield single in his first at-bat with the Major League
Baseball team this season after recovering from a broken ankle.  Jeter was in the starting lineup, batting second as the
designated hitter, for todayâ€™s 1 p.m. game against the Kansas
City Royals at Yankee Stadium.  The 39-year-old, normally a shortstop, broke his ankle in
the playoffs last October against the Detroit Tigers. He
aggravated it in spring training, delaying his return.  He hit the first pitch from Ervin Santana today weakly down
the third-base line. He was awarded a hit because there was no
play at first.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
