U.S. Comptroller of the Currency  Thomas Curry  has named Martin Pfinsgraff senior deputy
comptroller for large bank supervision to oversee examinations
of 19 banks with more than $8 trillion in total assets.  Pfinsgraff, who joined the OCC in 2011, had filled the role
on an acting basis since February, the OCC said today in a
statement. Before joining the national-bank regulator, he was
chief operating officer of risk-management company iJet
International and treasurer of Prudential Insurance Co., the OCC
said.  “Supervision of large complex institutions is an extremely
difficult and important function,” Curry said in the statement.
“Marty has a strong mix of private and public sector experience
as well as the kind of deep understanding of the industry’s risk
management issues to succeed in this role.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
