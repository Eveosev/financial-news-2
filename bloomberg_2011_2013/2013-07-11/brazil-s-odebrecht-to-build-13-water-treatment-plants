Odebrecht SA, a Brazilian
construction and engineering company, plans to build at least 13
wastewater-treatment facilities using technology co-developed by
the Netherland’s Royal HaskoningDHV.  Odebrecht’s Foz do Brasil SA unit will design a sewage-treatment plant in  Rio de Janeiro  for 430,000 residents and two
more this year in  Sao Paulo  to serve 140,000 people, engineering
consultant Royal HaskoningDHV said in a  statement . In  Brazil ,
less than 30 percent of all domestic wastewater is treated.  Odebrecht, based in Salvador, plans to develop 10 more
sewage plants via Foz over the next five years. The contract to
use Nereda technology is valued at at least 11.5 million euros
($15 million), according to the statement. Nereda plants use
less energy and chemicals than conventional water-purification
systems, according to yesterday’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
