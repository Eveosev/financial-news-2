England’s  Stuart Broad  will be able
to bowl against Australia after recovering from a shoulder
injury he suffered while batting yesterday on the opening day of
the Ashes cricket Test.  “Broad has passed his fitness test this morning and will
join the team on the field,” the England and Wales Cricket
Board said today on Twitter. “He is expected to be able to
bowl.”  Australia resumes its reply today trailing England by 140
runs after 14 wickets fell on the opening day of the series.  England was all out for 215 yesterday after winning the
toss at Trent Bridge in Nottingham as Australia fast bowler
 Peter Siddle  took five wickets for 50 runs. The tourists slipped
to 75-4 at the close of play.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
