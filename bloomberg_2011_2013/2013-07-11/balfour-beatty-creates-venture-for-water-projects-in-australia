Balfour Beatty Plc (BBY) , Britain’s
biggest construction company, said today that a newly created
venture will begin working in  Australia  with that country’s
largest water utility, Sydney Water.  The Balfour Beatty Leed venture will aid Sydney Water in
its network needs, focusing on slip-lining and pipe-bursting
services, the London-based infrastructure group said. The
venture will also be able to bid for about A$150 million ($138
million) of water projects over the next five years from
feasibility and design to construction and maintenance as a
result of its entry in Australia’s water works market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
