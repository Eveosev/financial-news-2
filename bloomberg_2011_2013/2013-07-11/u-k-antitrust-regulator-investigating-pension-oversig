A U.K. antitrust regulator said it
has concerns that pension programs don’t have sufficient
oversight after it collected evidence on the industry.  The  Office of Fair Trading  is worried that managers of
defined-contribution pension plans aren’t ensuring that
employees get the best investment outcomes, the regulator said
in a statement today. Some pensions don’t generate enough value,
and it’s difficult for employers to select the best pension plan
because the way providers present charges make them difficult to
compare, the OFT said.  “It is not the individual consumer that makes the choice
about their pension, it’s the employer,” said Barbara Limon,
from Age UK, a British charity that gives advice to the elderly.
“You get the pension that comes with the job. That’s why it is
important that they are all good quality.”  With defined contribution pension plans, the annual
contribution amount is specified, but the future benefits are
not guaranteed. Currently, around four million people are part
of a defined contribution workplace pension program, according
to the regulator. By 2018 this number will double.  Over the next month, the OFT said it will discuss their
concerns with the pension industry, government officials and
regulators to consider what actions need to be taken. The OFT
could refer the matter to the Competition Commission, which has
the power to propose structural changes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
