The International Monetary Fund has
not had any contact with  Egypt ’s interim government and will
take its cue from its member countries on how to interact with
the authorities, a fund spokesman said.  The Washington-based IMF, which was in discussion for a
$4.8 billion loan before President Mohamed Mursi was ousted last
week, is still in touch with counterparts “at a technical
level,” spokesman Gerry Rice told reporters in  Washington 
today.  “We continue to follow developments closely and are
considering their implications for the IMF’s work in helping
Egypt address its serious economic problems,” Rice said. “In
determining how to deal with the interim government of Egypt,
we’ll be guided as is usually the case in these circumstances by
the views of the international community, and in particular
those of the fund’s membership.”  Separately, Rice said the IMF board should consider the
next disbursement under a loan to  Greece  at the end of the
month, though there are “a number of issues still needing to be
resolved,” including on tax administration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
