Manchester United’s England striker
 Wayne Rooney  will fly home from the Premier League soccer
champion’s pre-season Asian tour because of an injury.  “Following a scan this evening on a hamstring injury
sustained in training, it has been decided that Wayne Rooney
should return home immediately for further assessment and
rehabilitation,” United said in a statement. “It is
anticipated he will be unavailable for selection for a month.”  Rooney, 27, has been surrounded by transfer speculation in
recent weeks, with Chelsea and Arsenal among the clubs linked to
him. United’s new manager  David Moyes  said last week that Rooney
is not for sale.  United’s squad arrived in Thailand this morning, on a tour
that also includes Australia and  Japan . After returning home,
the Red Devils will play Wigan in the Community Shield at
Wembley on Aug. 11 and open their Premier League program at
Swansea the following weekend.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
