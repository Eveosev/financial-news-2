The Ibovespa climbed the most in
four weeks, led by mining company  Vale SA (VALE3) , as metal prices
gained and Brazilian policy makers refrained from stepping up
the pace of increases in borrowing costs.  Klabin SA (KLBN3)  rose after the paper maker indicated it may
cancel a plan to sell shares, saying in a filing that the
offering will be held only if market conditions are favorable.
Steelmaker Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA led gains on the MSCI
 Brazil /Materials index, which jumped the most in four months.  The Ibovespa rose 2.5 percent to 46,626.26 at the close in

local time. Swap rates on the contract maturing in January fell
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.79 percent after
the central bank raised the target lending rate by 50 basis
points yesterday for a second straight meeting.  “The world economy is entering a new growth cycle, which
favors commodities, which favors Brazil,” Rogerio Freitas, a
partner at hedge fund Teorica Investimentos, said by phone from
Sao Paulo. “The external outlook is very positive, as central
banks around the world put investors at ease regarding their
strategy for monetary stimulus.”  China  may soften its stance on monetary policy, Nomura
Holdings Inc. said, after Premier  Li Keqiang  said growth must
stay above a certain level. Policy needs to remain very
stimulative “for the foreseeable future” in the U.S., Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday.  Vale rose 4.2 percent to 27.54 reais, contributing the most
to the Ibovespa’s advance. Klabin added 1.8 percent to 10.89
reais. CSN, as Siderurgica Nacional is also known, gained 7.1
percent to 5.91 reais.  Weaker Real  The Bloomberg Base Metals 3-Month Price Commodity Index

percent of the Ibovespa’s  weighting .  Brazil’s central bank raised the target lending rate to
8.50 percent yesterday, as forecast by all 51 analysts surveyed

in April and 50 basis points in May.  “The total tightening cycle could be smaller than the
market is pricing in,” Guilherme Loureiro, a Sao Paulo-based
economist at Barclays Plc, wrote in a note to clients after
yesterday’s policy meeting.  Homebuilders Gain  MRV Engenharia e Participacoes SA led gains by
homebuilders, advancing 5.7 percent to 6.45 reais.  Cyrela Brazil

percent increase in April.  The Ibovespa has slumped 24 percent this year, the worst
performance among the top 20 biggest equity markets tracked by

compared with 10.1 for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index of 21
developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume for stocks in  Sao Paulo  was 7.19 billion
