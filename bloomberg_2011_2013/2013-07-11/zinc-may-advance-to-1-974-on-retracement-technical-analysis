Zinc may climb to about $1,974 a
metric ton, the highest since March, as the metal has held above
a key support level at $1,812, according to  technical analysis 
by Commerzbank AG.  “Zinc has seen yet another rebound off the major support
zone,”  Karen Jones  and  Axel Rudolph , London-based technical
analysts, said in a July 10 report. “The market clearly is not
ready to break lower.”  The metal has gained about 5 percent since touching $1,812
on June 24, the lowest since May 15. The price may rise to the
200-day moving average at $1,968 and then to the 38.2 percent
Fibonacci retracement of $1,974 in the short term, according to
the report.  Zinc for delivery in three months traded at $1,903 on the
London Metal Exchange at 12:37 a.m. in Seoul.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts use charts of
