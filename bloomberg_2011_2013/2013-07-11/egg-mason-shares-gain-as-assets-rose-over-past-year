Legg Mason Inc. (LM)  rose by the most in
five months after reporting that its assets under management
increased 2 percent to $644.5 billion from a year earlier.  Legg Mason, which has struggled to reverse redemptions and
increase its  share price , rose as much as 5.3 percent, the
biggest intraday increase since Feb. 19, and traded 4.3 percent
higher at $32.94 by 10:49 a.m. in New York. Shares of Baltimore-based Legg Mason hit a two-year high of $36.13 in May.  “The equity franchise had modestly positive flows for the
month” after opening a closed-end fund at ClearBridge
Investments and amid fewer withdrawals at Royce & Associates,
Daniel Fannon, a San Francisco-based analyst at Jefferies & Co.,
wrote today in a note to clients.  Chief Executive Officer Joseph A. Sullivan has said he’s
focused on acquisitions to boost the firm’s assets and is
looking to buy a non-U.S. equity unit and expand the firm’s
alternative-investment offerings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
