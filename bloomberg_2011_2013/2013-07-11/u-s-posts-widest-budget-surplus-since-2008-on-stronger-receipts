The U.S. government posted the
widest monthly  budget surplus  in more than five years in June,
as spending plunged 47 percent and a stronger economy lifted tax
receipts, the Treasury Department said.  Receipts exceeded outlays by $116.5 billion last month, the
biggest surplus since April 2008, compared with a $59.7 billion
deficit in June 2012, the Treasury said today in Washington. The
result exceeded the $115 billion median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of 21 economists.  The Obama administration projects the  federal budget 
deficit will shrink to $759 billion in the year ending Sept. 30,
the smallest gap in five years as a stronger economy bolsters
revenue. Increased tax collections and rising payments to the
Treasury from  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac  as housing improves are
taking the pressure off of Congress and the White House to
achieve an agreement on dealing with spending, deficits or
automatic budget cuts.  “Tax receipts are continuing to improve” and that will
“persist throughout the rest of the year because the economy is
doing better,” said Thomas Simons, a government-debt economist
in  New York  at Jefferies LLC, which predicted a $116 billion
surplus for last month.  Today’s report showed revenue rose 10.2 percent in June to
$286.6 billion from the same month a year earlier. Spending
totaled $170.1 billion compared with $319.9 billion a year
earlier, it showed.  Fiscal Year  For the first nine months of the 2013 financial year that
began Oct. 1, the nation’s deficit narrowed to $509.8 billion
compared with a $904.2 billion shortfall over the same period
from a year before.  The U.S.’s AA+ credit-rating outlook was increased last
month to stable from negative by  Standard & Poor’s  based on
receding fiscal risks, less than two years after the company
stripped the world’s largest economy of its top ranking.  American employers added 195,000 workers for a second month
in June, according to a Labor Department report last week. The
jobless rate, at 7.6 percent last month, was down from 8.2
percent a year earlier.  The  Congressional Budget Office  said July 9 that net
corporate income taxes were higher by $29 billion, or 17
percent, “probably reflecting growth in taxable profits in both
calendar years 2012 and 2013.”  The brighter outlook may help postpone a deadline this year
for raising the government’s debt ceiling, and may ease demands
from some lawmakers for tough budget cuts. While government
spending cuts known as sequestration have helped narrow the
deficit, it has also restrained growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
