European Central Bank Governing
Council member Jens Weidmann said the ECB should raise  interest
rates  if needed to curb inflation.  The ECB’s forward guidance to keep rates at current levels
or lower for an extended period of time “shouldn’t exclude that
the benchmark rates will be raised in the future if inflation
pressure becomes apparent,” Weidmann said in a speech in Munich
today. “This is no historic change.”  ECB President  Mario Draghi  last week announced forward
guidance for the first time in the Frankfurt-based central
bank’s history, saying that borrowing costs will stay at their
present level or lower for a while. More than three-quarters of
respondents in a Bloomberg survey of 50 economists said that
this means the ECB won’t raise rates for at least 12 months.  Draghi’s assessment “is not a shift in strategy,”
Weidmann said. “It’s an attempt to explain our monetary stance
in an easier, more comprehensible way so that it is understood
by preferably all market participants.”  The ECB left its  benchmark rate  at a record low of 0.5
percent and its deposit rate at zero last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
