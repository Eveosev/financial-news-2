American Equity Investment Life
Holding Co., the seller of fixed annuities, today resumed plans
for a bond sale that was put on hold last month when yields on
speculative grade debt jumped.  The offering was increased to $400 million from $250
million, the  West Des Moines , Iowa-based insurer said today in a
statement distributed by Business Wire.  Bond yields fell yesterday after Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke called for maintaining stimulus. Average yields on
junk-rated corporate debt in the U.S. dropped to 6.92 percent
yesterday, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch Index
data. That compares with 7.15 percent on June 25, four days
after the insurer pulled the deal, citing “market conditions”
for bonds.  “We have the flexibility to be opportunistic about the
timing” of an offering, Chairman D.J. Noble said June 21 when
the sale was postponed.   JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  is leading the offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
