Cotton deliveries of 147 million
pounds against the July contract on ICE Futures U.S. were the
most for the month since at least 2008, exchange data showed.  Of the 2,943 contracts of 50,000 pounds (22,680 kilograms)
each, Newedge USA LLC took 2,882 contracts, exchange figures
showed. July futures expired on July 9 at 83.9 cents a pound. As
of yesterday, cotton  inventories  at warehouses monitored by ICE
were close to the highest in three years at 606,222 bales, or
291 million pounds.  Farmers may harvest 13.5 million bales in the year starting
Aug. 1, down 22 percent from a year earlier, partly because of a
drought in  Texas , the biggest growing state, the  U.S. Department
of Agriculture  said last month. The agency will update its
estimate today. Cotton futures for December delivery headed for
the longest rally in more than two months.  “We anticipate that with the big delivery against the July
futures, a large portion of the ICE certified stocks will
probably be taken out,” Michael T. Sweeney, a senior broker at
Marex North America LLC in New York, said in a telephone
interview. “With the U.S. crop falling and domestic supplies
tightening, mills will want to get their hands on that cotton.
We will know more about it today.”  In the 12 months ending July 31, 2014, U.S. stockpiles may
fall 28 percent to 2.6 million bales from a year earlier, the
USDA said last month.  Cotton futures for December delivery rose 0.1 percent to
86.9 cents at 11:19 a.m. on ICE in  New York . The price climbed
for the fourth straight day, poised for the longest rally since
April 30. Through yesterday, the most-active contract climbed 16
percent this year,  The USDA will issue supply and demand data at noon. The
U.S. is the world’s biggest cotton exporter. A bale weighs 480
pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
