Italian 10-year government bonds
advanced for the first time in three days, pushing the yield
down by seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 4.38
percent at 7:15 a.m. London time.  Spanish 10-year yields slipped seven basis points to 4.74
percent, the first decline since July 4.  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke yesterday called
for maintaining accommodation even as the minutes of policy
makersâ€™ June meeting showed them debating whether to stop bond
buying by the Fed in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
