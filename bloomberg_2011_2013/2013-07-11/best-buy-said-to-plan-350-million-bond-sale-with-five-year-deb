Best Buy Co. (BBY)  raised $500 million
after increasing the size of its first bond offering since 2011
as the world’s largest consumer-electronics retailer prepares to
repay an equal amount of notes due next week.  The 5 percent, five-year securities yield 359.9 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Best Buy had earlier planned to sell $350
million of bonds, according to a person with knowledge of the
transaction who asked not to be identified, citing lack of
authorization to speak publicly.  Proceeds may be used to refinance debt, fund working
capital or repurchase stock, Richfield, Minnesota-based Best Buy
said today in a regulatory filing.  Best Buy’s 6.75 percent bonds mature on July 15, Bloomberg
data show. The retailer, rated Baa2 by Moody’s Investors Service
and BB at  Standard & Poor’s , had  $908 million  of cash and
equivalents on May 4 and has reported three straight quarters of
net  losses  as it lowers prices to compete with online rivals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
