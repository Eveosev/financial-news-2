Andrew Bynum , who hasn’t played in
the  National Basketball Association  since the 2011-12 season,
has agreed to a two-year contract worth up to $24 million with
the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Plain Dealer reported, citing a
person familiar with the deal.  The 25-year-old center, who was acquired from the  Los
Angeles Lakers  after the 2011-12 season by the  Philadelphia
76ers , didn’t play last season after he suffered a bone bruise
and then injured his knee while bowling. He had surgery on both
knees in March.  The contact guarantees Bynum $6 million in the first season
with a second-year team option, the Plain Dealer said. The deal
could be worth $24 million based on incentives.  Bynum chose the Cavaliers over the Atlanta Hawks and Dallas
Mavericks, the newspaper said.  He is expected to be ready to play by the start of training
camp, the Plain Dealer said, citing Bynum’s agent, David Lee.
Lee said Bynum has to lose about 15 pounds.  The last time he played in the NBA, Bynum averaged 18.7
points and 11.8 rebounds during 60 games in the 2011-12 season
with the Lakers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
