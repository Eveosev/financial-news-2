Republicans have responded to the
delay of an important component of President  Barack Obama ’s
health-care reform by  escalating  their attacks. Here’s a
suggestion: Instead of trying to wreck the law, focus on using
it to prove the superiority of conservative principles.  The Affordable Care Act offers states enormous flexibility
in carrying out its two main elements: the creation of insurance
exchanges and the expansion of Medicaid. The White House,
desperate to bring more states on board, has entertained a range
of conservative proposals. Republican policy makers in some
states have begun to take advantage of that flexibility.  In Idaho, Butch Otter is one of just a handful of
Republican governors to set up insurance exchanges on their own
or in partnership with  Washington . Its design will reflect
 Idaho ’s small-government philosophy -- providing a minimalist,
streamlined approach, potentially offering a stark contrast with
the bells-and-whistles exchanges envisioned by neighboring
 Oregon  and nearby  California .  The state expects two benefits. Its exchange is more likely
to be up and running on time, and its low overhead costs will be
passed on to insurers in the form of lower assessment fees.
That, in turn, may lead to lower premiums for people buying
insurance.  Governors of both parties should thank Otter and his
state’s Republican legislators. If Idaho’s no-frills exchange
succeeds in producing lower costs and fewer glitches, it could
offer a new model for other states to follow. The only governors
who won’t be able to take advantage of that model are
Republicans who choose to let the federal government  run their
exchanges for them .  Another example of using the law to test conservative ideas
is taking place in Arkansas, where the Republican-led
legislature allowed Governor Mike Beebe, a Democrat, to seek new
federal Medicaid money on the condition that funds be channeled
through the state’s new exchange.  The state’s Republican House speaker, Davy Carter, called
the idea “a conservative alternative to the policy forced upon
us by the federal government.” The approach should yield
lessons for Republicans and Democrats alike.  First, it will test whether exchanges can be cheaper than
the traditional Medicaid system without reducing quality.
Second, it addresses an administrative challenge facing other
states: How to cope with people who cross the income threshold
between Medicaid coverage and exchange subsidies. Slight changes
in financial circumstances will push some people from one
program to the other; if Medicaid can be made to work through
the exchanges, the issue disappears. Other states’ lawmakers
will be taking note.  Iowa  is undertaking a slightly different experiment. After
first refusing to accept federal dollars to expand Medicaid,
Republican Governor Terry Branstad offered to take the money on
the condition that a portion of government premium payments
would be tied to the behavior of beneficiaries.  Under the state’s proposal, Iowa residents with low incomes
in a specified range will get insurance through the exchanges;
as in Arkansas, federal Medicaid dollars will pay the premiums.
Here’s the twist: Beneficiaries will have to meet a series of
health-related requirements, such as getting annual physicals or
diet counseling, or else pay a portion of their premiums.  None of these Republican variations are guaranteed to
succeed. Streamlined exchanges could prove less useful;
funneling Medicaid money through exchanges could raise costs;
and incentives for healthy behavior may lead nowhere. That’s the
point of experiments. Sometimes they fail, and you learn as much
from failures as from successes.  For all its weaknesses, we think Republicans are wrong
about the Affordable Care Act. The law’s opponents are under no
obligation to make what they see as a fundamentally flawed
approach work better -- but they do have an obligation to
suggest alternatives, and the law’s flexibility gives them
surprisingly wide scope. Republicans in Idaho,  Arkansas , Iowa
and other states are making the leap in good faith. Others
should follow their example, and it isn’t too late. There’s no
deadline for pursuing additional federal Medicaid dollars.
States that chose not to build exchanges for 2014 can do so for
2015.  Apart from anything else, it’s good politics: Open-minded
experiments will do far more to advance the Republican brand
than stolid obstruction.  To contact the Bloomberg View editorial board:
