Gasoline jumped to a three-month
high as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  called for
continuing monetary stimulus.  Futures rose a day after Bernanke said that “highly
accommodative monetary policy for the foreseeable future is
what’s needed in the  U.S. economy .” A Labor Department report
today showing  jobless claims  increased to a two-month high
indicated that the Fed may not soon reduce its $85 billion in
monthly bond purchases. Gasoline jumped above $3 a gallon for
the first time since April yesterday after a report that
inventories dropped the most in 11 weeks and demand reached the
highest level since August.  “Bernanke’s statement that they’re not going to pull back
seems to have fostered another leg on the rally,” said  Gene
McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “But the market is overdone.”  August-delivery gasoline rose 1.48 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to $3.0297 a gallon at 10 a.m. on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange on trading volume that was 62 percent above the 100-day
average for the time of day.  The Energy Information Administration reported yesterday
that  gasoline supplies  fell 2.63 million barrels to 221 million,
the fewest since May 31 and the biggest drop since April 19.
Demand increased for a fourth straight week to 9.3 million
barrels a day, the most since Aug. 10.  Gasoline’s  crack spread  versus WTI widened $1.99 to $22.09
a barrel. The fuel’s  premium  over Brent jumped 96 cents to
$19.08, the biggest gap since April 1.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, rose 1.7 cents to $3.518
a gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website.
That’s the highest price since June 26.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel, or ULSD, for August delivery
gained 0.96 cent to $3.0113 a gallon on volume that was 27
percent below the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate crude
increased $1.57 to $21.12 a barrel. The  premium over Brent 
widened 59 cents to $18.15 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
