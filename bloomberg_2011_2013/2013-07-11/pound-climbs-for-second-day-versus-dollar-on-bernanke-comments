The pound strengthened for a second
day against the dollar after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the  U.S. economy  still needed stimulus that tends
to devalue a currency.  Sterling climbed from a four-month low versus the euro
before the  Bank of England  publishes the minutes of its most
recent meeting next week that will reveal how policy makers
voted at new Governor  Mark Carney ’s first meeting. U.K.
government bonds rose for a fourth day as the U.K. Debt
Management Office sold 2.5 billion pounds ($3.78 billion) of 30-year gilts.  “The pound’s strength is driven mostly by dollar weakness
following Bernanke’s comments,” said  Ian Stannard , head of
European currency strategy at Morgan Stanley in London. “The
message he tried to get across is that  interest rates  are going
to remain low for some time. I would not rule out further
sterling gains in the very near term.”  The pound advanced 0.8 percent to $1.5128 at 4:35 p.m.
 London  time after declining to $1.4814 on July 9, the lowest
level since June 2010. The U.K. currency strengthened 0.3
percent to 86.22 pence per euro after sliding to 86.94, the
weakest since March 13.  Bernanke called yesterday for maintaining stimulus in the
U.S. even as the minutes of the Fed’s June 18-19 meeting showed
policy makers debating whether to stop bond buying this year.  “Highly accommodative monetary policy for the foreseeable
future is what’s needed in the U.S. economy,” Bernanke said
yesterday in response to a question after a speech in Cambridge,
 Massachusetts .  The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee kept its
asset-purchase target at 375 billion pounds on July 4. the
minutes of the meeting will be released on July 17.  Net Wagers  Futures traders increased bets the pound will weaken
against the dollar, according to data from the Washington-based
Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on a decline in the pound compared with
those on a gain totaled 31,324 contracts on July 2, compared
with so-called net shorts of 19,429 a week earlier. The
difference was as much as 77,738 on June 7.  The premium for three-month options granting the right to
sell the pound relative to those giving the right to buy climbed
to 1.64 percentage points on July 5, the highest since July 2012
and up from 0.475 in January, according to risk-reversal rates
compiled by Bloomberg. The premium was at 1.28 percent today.  Risk Reversals  “I’d recommend to play the risk-reversals becoming more
negative” for the pound, said Olivier Korber, a currency-derivatives strategist at Societe Generale SA in Paris.
“Eventually, the BOE-Fed divergence will hit the pound even
more.”  The pound has weakened 1.9 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that track 10 developed-nation currencies. The dollar strengthened 6.3 percent and the
euro gained 5 percent.  Gilts advanced as Bernanke’s comments added to speculation
other central banks around the world will increase bond
purchases to put downward pressure on borrowing costs.  The benchmark 10-year gilt yield fell three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 2.39 percent. The 1.75 percent bond
maturing in September 2022 rose 0.23, or 2.30 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 94.80.  The Debt Management Office sold bonds due in July 2044 at
an average yield of 3.553 percent, compared with 3.293 percent
at the previous auction of 30-year securities on May 16.  The yield on the existing gilt maturing in January 2044
declined three basis points to 3.56 percent.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 3.3 percent this year
through yesterday, Bloomberg World Bond Indexes show. German
bonds declined 1.3 percent and Treasuries fell 3.6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
