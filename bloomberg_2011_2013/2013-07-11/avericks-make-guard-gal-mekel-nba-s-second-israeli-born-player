Free-agent point guard Gal Mekel
signed with the  Dallas  Mavericks, becoming the second Israeli-born player to land a National Basketball Association contract.  Mekel, 25, follows forward Omri Casspi, the first Israeli
to play in the NBA, the Mavericks said today in an e-mailed
release. Dallas didn’t provide financial details of Mekel’s
contract, citing team policy.  A native of Petah Tikva, Mekel played at Wichita State
University from 2006 to 2008 before leaving school to play in
Europe, according to the release. A two-time Most Valuable
Player in  Israel ’s top league, Mekel led Maccabi Haifa to a
championship last season, averaging 13.3 points and 5.4 assists
per game.  Casspi, 25, has played four NBA seasons with the Sacramento
Kings and Cleveland Cavaliers. He averaged a career-high 10.3
points per game in 2009-10 with the Kings.  To contact the reporters on this story:
