Industrias Penoles SAB, Mexico’s
second-biggest mining company by market value, rose the most in
a week as precious metals prices gained.  The shares advanced 6.3 percent to 425.55 pesos at the
close of trading in Mexico City. It was the best performance on
the country’s benchmark IPC index of 35 stocks, which gained 1.2
percent.  Silver and gold prices rallied after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday that the U.S. needs
“highly accommodative monetary policy for the foreseeable
future.” Silver futures for September delivery advanced as much
as 5.7 percent. Gold futures for delivery in August gained as
much as 4 percent.  “Basically it’s the rising price of silver” driving
Penoles’s gain today,  Carlos Hermosillo , an equity analyst with
Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB, said in a telephone interview from
Mexico City. “Being the principal product of the company,
there’s a direct correlation between the stock price and the
market price.”  Shares in  Groupo Mexico SAB (GMEXICOB) , the country’s largest mining
company, rose 4 percent today, the most since July 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
