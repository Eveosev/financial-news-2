Etihad Airways , the third-biggest
Persian Gulf carrier, ordered $200 million worth of pilot
training tools for planes including the  Airbus SAS (EAD)  A380 and
 Boeing Co. (BA)  787 as it takes the first of the models next year.  Etihad is buying three 787 full flight simulators and one
for the A380 superjumbo from Canada’s  CAE Inc. (CAE) , the Abu Dhabi-based carrier said today. It also is acquiring a training
simulator for Airbus A350 long-range jets and two more for the
A320 short-range plane.  Etihad is due to receive the first of 10 A380s in the
fourth quarter of next year, joining Emirates of Dubai, the
biggest A380 customer, and Qatar Airways Ltd., which gets its
first plane in March. The airline also is expanding its service
activities including maintenance of planes and training.  “These new full flight simulators will ensure we are
ideally placed for the next phase in our expansion,” Chief
Executive Officer  James Hogan . Hogan said construction at the
training academy will double its size and eventually house 11
full flight simulators.  The first A320 simulator is due in November when a training
center expansion is due for completion, Etihad said. The other
training tools should be delivered over the course of a year.
Those come on top of four devices already in place to aid pilots
in learning how to operate Boeing 777s, Airbus A320s, and the
A330 and A340 long-range jets.  Etihad operates 77 Airbus and Boeing planes with more than
90 new ones on firm order, including 41 Dreamliners, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
