Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE) , the
operator of Colombia’s largest oil field, rose the most in two
months after saying output was near the high end of its target
range for the second straight quarter.  The shares gained 4.2 percent to 34,000 pesos at 10:08 a.m.
in Bogota, rebounding from a three-year low. It was the best
performer on the benchmark  Colcap index , which rose 1.2 percent.  Pacific Rubiales expects to report second-quarter output
“similar” to the prior quarter’s 128,000 barrels of oil
equivalent per day, the company said in a production update
today before the full earnings report scheduled for Aug. 8.
Production grew about 38 percent from a year ago, according to
the statement.  The Bogota-based oil producer’s preview showed “solid”
production, Jared Dziuba, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets,
wrote in a research report. Dziuba had been forecasting 126,000
barrels per day.  Pacific said in a presentation at the beginning of the year
that it was forecasting 115,000 to 130,000 barrels a day for
2013, which Chief Executive Officer Ronald Pantin said at the
time was “conservative guidance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
