The U.S. Pacific Island territory of
 Guam  is considering a switch to liquefied natural gas for
generating power after a feasibility study is completed in 2015.  The Guam Power Authority, the sole power provider on the
island, may shift from oil products because more LNG is becoming
available from  North America , Australia and Papua New Guinea,
according to a company official. He asked not to be identified
because he isn’t authorized to speak to the media.  The Guam Power Authority burns fuel oil and diesel to
generate power, according to the government-owned company’s
 website . Guam doesn’t import or produce natural gas,  data  from
the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
