Jordan  began pumping water from the
southern aquifer of Disi today to help meet demand in the
capital of one of the worldâ€™s driest countries, state-run Petra
news agency said, citing the minister for water and irrigation.  Water from the $990 million project involved digging 55
wells in the ancient aquifer to pipe supplies 325 kilometers
(200 miles) from Disi to Amman. Experimental pumping from the
aquifer started at midnight and will ease water shortages in the
capital and elsewhere over the next month, Hazem Nasser told
Petra. The project by the Saudi border seeks to extract about
100 million cubic meters of water a year from the aquifer.  Gama Enerji AS carried out the project started in 2009.
Only three countries have more severe water shortages than
Jordan, according to Robert Blecher, Arab-Israeli Project
Director for International Crisis Group, a  New York  policy
group. Syrians fleeing their war-torn country for refugee camps
and cities in Jordan have put a strain on water and other
resources. About a half-million people have escaped  Syria  for
Jordan, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees says.  To contact the reporter on this story:
