Vietnam ’s central bank said it has
no plans for a repeat of last month’s dong devaluation, the
first since 2011, and pledged to support the currency.  “The State Bank of Vietnam affirms that it isn’t going to
adjust its dong-dollar  exchange rate  and will take determined
measures to stabilize the rate,” Deputy Governor Le Minh Hung
said in a note posted on the State Bank of Vietnam’s website
late yesterday. “That includes strong intervention,” he said,
adding that foreign-exchange reserves “are at high levels.”  The monetary authority weakened its dong  reference rate  by
1 percent to 21,036 per dollar on June 28 to support exports and
help revive an economy that grew last year at the slowest pace
since at least 2006. The currency is allowed to diverge by as
much as 1 percent from the fixing, which had prior to the
devaluation been set at 20,828 since December 2011. Last month’s
change aimed to “improve the balance of payments and increase
foreign-exchange reserves,” the central bank said at the time.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam forecasts the country will have a
$5 billion balance of payments surplus in 2013, easing pressure
on the dong, Hung said in the note, which was a transcript of an
interview conducted with him. The government estimates the trade
deficit will be $9 billion this year and narrow to $1.2 billion
in 2014.  The dong traded at 21,233 per dollar as of 11:14 a.m. in
Hanoi, little changed from 21,236 yesterday, according to prices
from banks compiled by Bloomberg. It earlier touched a record-low 21,243 for the fifth day in a row, within 0.03 percent of
the weak end of its permitted trading band. The reference  rate 
has been lowered by 22 percent in the past five years.  Devaluation Risk  “Another devaluation of the dong may not happen in the
next three months, but after three months it is another story,”
Nguyen Duy Phong, a Ho Chi Minh City-based analyst at Viet
Capital Securities Co. said by phone today. “We will have to
look at some factors including the trade deficit and domestic
gold demand at that time.”  The currency will weaken a further 2 percent to 3 percent
by the end of the year, Michael Kokalari and Hang Vu, Ho Chi
Minh City-based analysts at Maybank Kim Eng Securities Inc.,
wrote in a July 3 research note.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
