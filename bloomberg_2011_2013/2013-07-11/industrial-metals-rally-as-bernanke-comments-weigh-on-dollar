Industrial metals climbed after
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the U.S. needs
stimulative monetary policy for the foreseeable future.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 2.5 percent to $6,994 a metric ton, the
highest since July 4, before trading at $6,941 at 9:26 a.m. in
 Shanghai . Aluminum, lead, nickel and tin also advanced, while
zinc was little changed.  “Highly accommodative monetary policy for the foreseeable
future is what’s needed in the  U.S. economy ,” Bernanke said
yesterday. The comments came three hours after the central bank
released minutes of the June 18-19 gathering, which showed many
Fed officials wanted to see more signs employment is improving
before backing a trim to bond purchases. The dollar declined
versus most of its major peers, with the Dollar Index losing as
much as 1.6 percent today. Commodities priced in dollars tend to
move counter to the currency.  “The comments give a boost to the commodities priced in
the dollar,” said He Shan, an analyst at Galaxy Futures Co. in
Beijing. “But the rally may not last long because investors
still expect an exit next year.”  Copper for delivery in November on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange advanced 2.7 percent to 49,920  yuan  ($8,138) a ton.
Metal for delivery in September on the Comex rose 1.9 percent to
$3.1495 a pound.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
