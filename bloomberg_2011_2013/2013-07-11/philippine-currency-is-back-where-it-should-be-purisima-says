The Philippine peso has returned to
a level that is appropriate and the government will curb
excessive volatility to ensure markets aren’t disrupted, Finance
Secretary Cesar Purisima said.  “We monitor it among a band of currencies and it’s back
where it should be,” Purisima told Bloomberg Television’s  Susan Li  and  Rishaad Salamat  in an interview in  Hong Kong  today. “We
just want to smoothen the movements of the peso so that it’s not
disruptive.”  The peso has fallen about 5 percent this year as
speculation that the U.S. will pare back stimulus led to an
outflow from  emerging markets  in recent weeks. The Philippine
government, which has refrained from selling global bonds this
year to manage capital inflows lured by the nation’s attainment
of investment-grade credit ratings and one of the fastest growth
rates in Asia, will continue to coordinate debt sales and
borrowing plans with the central bank, Purisima said.  Inflows into the nation’s financial markets climbed to a
decade-high in 2012, making the peso the second-best performer
in the region last year among 11 Asian currencies.  The government will boost spending on infrastructure to
support growth that’s been largely consumer-driven, Purisima
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
