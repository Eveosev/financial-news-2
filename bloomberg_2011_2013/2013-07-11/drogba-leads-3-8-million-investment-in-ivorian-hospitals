A foundation founded by  Didier Drogba , the Ivory Coast soccer player, will invest 2.5 million
pounds ($3.8 million) building hospitals in the west African
nation.  The project, the foundation’s biggest since it started in
2007, will lead the construction of at least five health centers
for women and children in Yamoussoukro, the capital, and the
cities of Abidjan,  San Pedro , Man and Korhogo, Guy Roland Tanoh,
the general secretary of the  Didier Drogba Foundation , said in a
phone interview yesterday. The money, 80 percent of which has
already been raised, will come from charity galas organized in
London.  Drogba, 35, won the European  Champions League  with Chelsea
in 2012 and currently plays for Turkish club Galatasaray. He has
served as the captain of  Ivory Coast ’s national soccer team,
known as the elephants.  The first hospital will open in Attecoube in Abidjan, Ivory
Coast’s most populous city and commercial capital, Tanoh said.
Work started in June and will last an estimated 6 to 8 months,
he said. The second health center will be built in capital
Yamoussoukro, Tanoh said.  Lebanese-Ivorian architect Pierre Fakhoury, known for
having designed the Yamoussoukro basilica, the largest Christian
Church in the world, has been chosen to construct the hospitals,
Tanoh said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
