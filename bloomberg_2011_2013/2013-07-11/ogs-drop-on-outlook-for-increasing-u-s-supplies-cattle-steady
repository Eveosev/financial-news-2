Hog futures declined on projections
for increasing U.S. pork output. Cattle prices were little
changed.  Pork production in the three months ending in September
will increase 3.1 percent from the previous quarter, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said in a  report  today. Output will
reach 24.14 billion pounds (10.95 million metric tons) next
year, which is 0.5 percent higher than forecast in June because
of more pigs per litter, the USDA said. Wholesale  pork  fell 2.4
percent to $1.0236 yesterday, the lowest since June 13,
government data show.  “The second to third quarter production is supposed to
jump quite a bit,” Paul Beere, a grain and livestock adviser at
Prime Agricultural Consultants, said in a telephone interview
from Brookfield,  Wisconsin . “We’re going to see the pork cutout
fall off here in the next month,” he said, referring to
wholesale prices.  Hog futures for August settlement slid 0.4 percent to close
at 95.275 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The price is up 11 percent this year.  Cattle futures for August delivery slumped 0.1 percent to
$1.21925 a pound on the CME. Feeder-cattle futures for August
settlement declined 0.3 percent to $1.50125 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
