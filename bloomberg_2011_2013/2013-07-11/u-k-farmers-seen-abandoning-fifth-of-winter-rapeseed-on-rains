U.K. farmers probably abandoned 22
percent of their winter rapeseed this year after excess rains
swamped fields and ruined crops, agricultural market researcher
Kleffmann Group said.  About 545,000 hectares (1.35 million acres) of winter
rapeseed will be left to harvest this year, after farmers
originally planted 701,000 hectares, the Ludinghausen, Germany-based company said, citing a farmer survey it conducted with
Independent Business Resource Ltd., a consultant in Uffcott,
 England .  Some fields were replanted with barley and other crops,
including spring varieties of rapeseed, linseed, pulses and
potatoes, while a “significant number of farmers were leaving
the land fallow,” according to the online  report  dated
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
