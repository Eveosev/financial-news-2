Repsol SA (REP) , the Spanish oil company
that sued YPF,  Chevron (CVX)  Corp. and Bridas Group after the seizure
of its Argentine unit, will have its unfair competition claims
judged in Spain after a court ruled it was fit to try the cases.  Spain’s mercantile court has agreed to hear cases filed by
Repsol against  oil companies  that are doing deals with YPF after
its Argentine unit was nationalized in April 2012 without
compensation, according to court documents seen by Bloomberg.
The court dismissed an appeal it had received from Argentina
stating the cases should not be heard in Spain. A Repsol
spokesman declined to comment.  The lawsuits allege that companies such as Chevron and the
billionaire Bulgheroni brothers’ Bridas Group holdings,
currently in billion-dollar projects to develop Argentina’s
Neuquen province shale fields with YPF, are engaging in unlawful
competition by seeking to benefit from assets that were
illegally confiscated. The Madrid court will bundle these cases
into one, the documents showed.  Repsol’s board recently rejected a compensation offer from
YPF for a 47 percent stake in a joint venture in the Vaca Muerta
formation valued at $3.5 billion, as well as $1.5 billion toward
development. The company is currently involved in another
lawsuit in  New York  that seeks compensation of $10.5 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
