European Union President  Herman Van Rompuy  said the 28-nation bloc needs to beef up surveillance to
deter migrants.  “We have to deal with this problem in a humane and at the
same time an effective way,”  Van Rompuy   told reporters  today in
Valletta, Malta, after talks with the country’s prime minister,
Joseph Muscat. “We have to address the root causes of migration
such as poverty, conflict and trafficking - and we need more
surveillance.”  Malta, located a few hundred kilometres from the North
African coast, receives “by far the highest number of asylum
requests proportionate to your population and you are often also
the first point of entry,” Van Rompuy said.  Van Rompuy and Muscat also discussed the migration issue
with a Libyan deputy prime minister. The meeting “set the ball
rolling for developments that can be achieved in the next few
months,” Muscat said.  Today’s meetings helped to “break new ground” on
migration, Muscat said. “We reiterated our point of view, which
is basically that we cannot be left alone as a country. There is
a sense of abandonment that our citizens feel. We have been
assured that  Europe  does not intend to leave this country
alone.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
