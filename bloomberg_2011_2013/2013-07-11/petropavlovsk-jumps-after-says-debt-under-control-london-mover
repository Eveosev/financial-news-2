Petropavlovsk Plc (POG) , a miner of gold
in  Russia , rebounded from a record low in  London  trading,
climbing the most in more than four years after saying it
continues to operate within its bank covenants.  Petropavlovsk jumped as much as 26 percent, the steepest
intraday gain since Jan. 26, 2009. It was the  best performer  on
the FTSE All-Share Mining Index. The company said it’s not aware
of any “particular recent event” that could account for the
fall in its share price.  “The group continues to operate with financial headroom
provided by its long-term banking facilities and restates its
target of reducing net debt,” it said today in a statement.  Petropavlovsk fell 14 percent yesterday to 67.25 pence, the
lowest since it first sold shares in 2002. The shares tumbled
partly on its debt levels. The company reported net debt of $1.2
billion at the end of the first quarter, up from $1.06 billion
at the end of 2012.  “In the current gold price environment, investors are
understandably worried when considering heavily indebted
businesses going into a downturn,”  Investec Plc (INVP)  said in a note
to investors today. If the company reveals in its next results
“that the bank covenants have been tested and the group is
comfortable, this may provide support for the shares.”  Petropavlovsk traded 12.75 pence higher at 80 pence by
10:00 a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
