Cotton futures fell the most in
seven weeks after the U.S. government increased its projections
for the world crop.  World output for the crop year starting Aug. 1 is seen at
118.02 million bales, up 0.7 percent from 117.16 million
estimated in June, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said today
in a report. Consumption will be 109.79 million bales, less than
the 110.17 million forecast a month ago. Stockpiles may be 94.34
million, up 10 percent from a revised 85.58 million in the
previous year. A bale weighs 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms.  “There is no upside for cotton without a weather event,
especially with the increase in world output,” Michael Smith,
the president of T&K Futures & Options in Port St. Lucie,
 Florida , said in a telephone interview. “There will have to be
a lot more drought-like weather in  Texas  to see anything bullish
again.”  Cotton for December delivery fell 2.2 percent to 84.88
cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York at 1:47 p.m.,
heading for the biggest loss since May 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
