Cocoa processing in  North America 
probably increased 4.4 percent in the second quarter as an
improving economic outlook spurs demand from chocolate makers, a
survey showed.  In the three months ended June 28, grinding may have risen
to 117,762 metric tons from 112,768 a year earlier, according to
the average of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg news.  Officials from the  Federal Reserve  predict the  U.S. economy 
will grow 2.3 percent to 2.6 percent this year and 3 percent to
3.5 percent in 2014. That compares with  2.2 percent  in 2012.
U.S. chocolate sales climbed 6.3 percent in June from a year
earlier, according to data from research company IRI compiled by
Bloomberg Industries.  “The economy is looking better,” Fain Shaffer, the
president of Infinity Trading Corp. in Medford, Oregon, said in
a telephone interview. “It seems that the good times are back,
and this should help demand for cocoa.”  The  National Confectioners Association  will release the
official data on July 18 in Washington.  “Figures last year were lower than normal, and business
has moderated,” Joe Mallaney, the managing director of soft
commodities for Newedge USA LLC in New York, said in an e-mail.
“Demand for nearby cocoa butter has picked up to encourage
grind.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
