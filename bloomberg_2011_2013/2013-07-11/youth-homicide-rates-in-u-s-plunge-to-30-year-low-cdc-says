Homicide rates for young Americans
plummeted to a 30-year low in 2010, showing that early
intervention programs help reduce violence, U.S. health
officials said.  About 4,800 U.S. youths ages 10 to 24 were murdered that
year, making homicide one of the top three causes of deaths for
the age group, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
said in a report today. The rate was 7.5 per 100,000 youths in
2010, with declines shown in all age, ethnic and racial groups.
Almost four of five of the homicides were committed with guns.  Prevention programs in schools and communities have been
shown to reduce the risk of violence and need to be emphasized
by public health leaders, the Atlanta-based CDC said. The
programs complement law enforcement efforts, which decrease
violence though “don’t stop it from occurring in the first
place,” the agency said.  “We know communities are working really hard to prevent
violence,” said Corinne David-Ferdon, a behavioral scientist in
the CDC’s division of violence prevention who was an author of
the report. “It is important to think about multiple
strategies, from communication to family level to community
building,” she said in a telephone interview.  The homicide rate during the period from 1981 to 2010
reached a peak in 1993, the CDC said. Homicide rates for male
youths declined less than for females in the last 10 years
studied, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
