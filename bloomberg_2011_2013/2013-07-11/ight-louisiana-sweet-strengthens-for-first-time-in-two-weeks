Light Louisiana Sweet strengthened
against benchmark West Texas Intermediate for the first time in
more than two weeks after the U.S. benchmark retreated from a
15-month-high and its discount to Brent widened.  LLS, the light, sweet benchmark on the U.S. Gulf Coast,
advanced after WTI weakened from its highest intraday level
since March 27, 2012, as the Labor Department said jobless
claims increased to a two-month high in the week ended July 6.
LLS competes with foreign crudes priced against Brent for space
in U.S. refineries. Brent’s premium to WTI grew 82 cents today,
the most since June 4, to $2.82 a barrel.  LLS’s premium to WTI in Cushing,  Oklahoma , widened by 20
cents to $4.90 a barrel, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It’s the first time the price has strengthened since
June 25.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet weakened by 5 cents to a premium of
$4 a barrel above the U.S. benchmark. Mars Blend’s discount
widened by 20 cents to $1.25. Poseidon slid 5 cents to a $2.05
discount.  Crude from the Southern Green Canyon slid 25 cents to to a
$2.15 discount to WTI. Thunder Horse’s premium shrank 10 cents
to $1.60.  To contact the reporter on this story:
