A case of 1990 Chateau d’Yquem,
Bordeaux’s top-ranked Sauternes dessert wine, sold for 2,700
pounds ($4,050) on the Liv-ex market yesterday, extending a 15-month drop and taking it to its lowest level since October 2009.  The wine sold for 20 percent less than the 3,380 pounds at
which it traded in March last year, having peaked at 3,400
pounds in September 2011, according to data on London-based Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website.  While the start of the vintage’s decline mirrored a broader
drop in the Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index during the first half of
last year, it has continued to retreat even as the index has
recovered since November, partly as investor attention has
switched to wines from more recent years.  “Market sentiment is more positive than the indices might
suggest,” Liv-ex said in its monthly Cellar Watch market report
this week, citing a 20 percent increase in overall trading
volume.  Yquem’s 1990 vintage is its fourth most expensive of the
past two decades, lagging only those of 2010, 2009 and 2001,
according to merchant prices tracked by Liv-ex. It’s still 69
percent higher than its level of 1,600 pounds 10 years ago.  The 1990 Yquem was awarded 99 points out of 100 by U.S.
wine critic  Robert Parker , according to the  eRobertParker 
website. Of its wines from the intervening years, only the 2001
is currently rated higher at 100 points.  Chateau d’Yquem is owned by Paris-based  LVMH Moet Hennessy
Louis Vuitton SA (MC) , the world’s largest luxury goods maker led by
billionaire  Bernard Arnault . The wine estate is managed by
Pierre Lurton, who also has responsibility for Chateau Cheval
Blanc in Saint-Emilion.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Guy Collins in London at
