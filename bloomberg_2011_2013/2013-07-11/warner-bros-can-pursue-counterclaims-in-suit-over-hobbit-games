Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s  Warner Bros .
Entertainment unit can pursue counterclaims in a lawsuit by
author J.R.R. Tolkien’s estate over the right to license “Lord
of the Rings” and “Hobbit” online and gambling games.  U.S. District Judge Audrey Collins in  Los Angeles  today
denied a request by the estate and Tolkien heirs to dismiss
Warner Bros.’ and producer Saul Zaentz’s counterclaims, saying
they are routine contract-based claims and aren’t improper
because the estate sued first.  The estate sued last year, alleging that the movie studio
and its subsidiaries have the right to sell and license only
tangible objects, not downloadable video games. Warner Bros.
also doesn’t have permission to license online slot machines and
casino  slot machines  based on the late author’s books, according
to the Nov. 19 complaint.  Bonnie Eskenazi, a lawyer for the Tolkien estate, didn’t
immediately return a call to her office for comment on the
ruling.  The case is Fourth Age Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Digital
Distribution Inc., 12-cv-09912, U.S. District Court, Central
District of California (Los Angeles.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
