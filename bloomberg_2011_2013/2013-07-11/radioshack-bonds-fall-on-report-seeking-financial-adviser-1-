RadioShack Corp. (RSH)  is engaged in
discussions with investment banks to evaluate ways to strengthen
its finances, the company said.  “Like many companies, we have discussions with investment
banks to help us evaluate ways to further strengthen our balance
sheet and manage it efficiently,” Kirk Brewer, a spokesman at
the Fort Worth, Texas-based company, said today in an e-mailed
statement. “That has been the sole focus of these
discussions.”  The statement came after RadioShack’s bonds and shares
earlier tumbled following a report from Debtwire that it was
seeking an adviser to explore ways to fix its finances.  The electronics retailer is “focused on executing our
turnaround and serving our customers,” Brewer said.
“RadioShack continues to have a strong balance sheet with total
liquidity of $820 million at the end of the first quarter.”  RadioShack’s $325 million of 6.75 percent notes due May
2019 dropped as much as 2.6 cents to 69 cents on the dollar,
before trading at 73 cents as of 4:18 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Its shares plunged as much as 23 percent before paring the
decline to 7 percent, ending the day at $2.63 in New York
trading.  To contact the reporters on this story:
