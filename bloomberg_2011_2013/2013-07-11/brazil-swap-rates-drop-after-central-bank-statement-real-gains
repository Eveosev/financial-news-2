Brazil ’s swap rates fell to a four-week low as policy makers dashed speculation they would step up
the pace of interest-rate increases after raising the benchmark
rate by 50 basis points for a second straight meeting.  Swap rates due in January declined four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 8.76 percent at 9:32 a.m. in  Sao
Paulo , the lowest level on a closing basis since June 14. The
real gained 0.2 percent to 2.2600 per dollar.  The central bank ’s board, led by President Alexandre Tombini, yesterday raised the target rate to 8.50 percent, as
forecast by all 51 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The move to
continue with a 50 basis point increase “will contribute to put
inflation on a decline and assure that this trend will persist
next year,” policy makers said in a statement after the
decision.  The central bank used the same language in its statement
that it did previously, a sign that it will not quicken the pace
of rate increases after inflation exceeded the ceiling of policy
makers’ target range, said  David Beker , Brazil economist at
Banco Merrill Lynch SA.  “There were some marginal expectations of an acceleration
in the pace of increases and the fact they didn’t change their
statement was read by markets as the central bank is comfortable
with this strategy,” he said in a phone interview from Sao
Paulo.  Inflation in Brazil quickened to a 20-month high of 6.70
percent in June, exceeding the 6.50 percent upper level of
central bank’s target range.  To contact the reporter on this story:
