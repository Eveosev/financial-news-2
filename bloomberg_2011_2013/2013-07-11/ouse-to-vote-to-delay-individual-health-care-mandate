(Corrects headline to specify delay.)  House Speaker  John Boehner  said the
chamber will vote next week to delay the 2010 health-care law’s
requirement that most Americans carry health insurance.  At his weekly news conference today, the speaker said it’s
not fair for President  Barack Obama ’s administration to keep
that provision in effect while postponing enforcement of the
requirement that businesses provide their workers with
insurance.  “I believe it’s unfair to protect big business from
Obamacare but not individuals and families,” Boehner said.  The Republican-controlled House previously has voted 37
times to repeal or defund all or part of the Affordable Care
Act, enacted with only Democratic votes. Republicans have sought
to make the plan a symbol of government overreach.  The employer requirement is being delayed until 2015, the
administration said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
