Clariant AG, (CLN)  the Swiss chemical
maker, expects to continue expanding in the U.S. to take
advantage of the  “tremendous opportunity” created by rising
production of oil and natural gas from shale formations.  Clariant is doubling its capacity in Louisville,  Kentucky ,
to make catalysts that help convert gas liquids into propylene
and butadiene, Chief Financial Officer Patrick Jany said by
phone yesterday. It doubled capacity to make ethylene
derivatives for crop chemicals and consumer products last year
in Clear Lake, Texas, and the company “will certainly be
looking at further increases” there, he said.  Clariant joins Dow Chemical Co. and  South Africa ’s  Sasol
Ltd. (SOL) , among others, in expanding U.S. production amid increased
output of oil and gas from shale formations. The Muttenz,
Switzerland-based company will benefit from sales to U.S. oil
producers as well as to chemical makers benefiting from lower
costs for raw materials and energy, he said.  “It’s a tremendous opportunity for us,” Jany said. “We
look at continuously increasing our capacity in the U.S.”  The company has begun to reverse a historical decline in
U.S. market share, Clariant’s largest national market, with
about  14 percent  of sales last year, he said.  The oil and mining services unit is expanding its global
headquarters in The Woodlands,  Texas , this year to accommodate
growth, including the purchase this year of Gulf of Mexico
operations from Champion Technologies Inc., Jany said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
