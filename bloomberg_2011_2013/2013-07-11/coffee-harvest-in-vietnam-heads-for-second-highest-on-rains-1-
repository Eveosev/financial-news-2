The coffee harvest in  Vietnam , the
world’s biggest grower of robusta beans used by  Nestle SA (NESN)  in
instant drinks, will probably be the second largest on record as
regular rains boost fruit development.  Production may climb 10 percent to 1.6 million metric tons
in the 12 months starting in October from 1.45 million tons a
year earlier, according to the median of 13 trader and shipper
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the highest since a
record 1.65 million tons in 2011-2012 and 6.7 percent more than
the median in a survey published in May.  A bigger crop may curb a rally in prices from a 32-month
low in June, spurred by Vietnamese farmers holding back beans
and sales slowing in third-ranking  Indonesia  before the Muslim
fasting month of Ramadan. Prices are still down 15 percent from
the March high, when dry weather in Vietnam threatened to cut
output as much as 30 percent. The drought ended in May with
rainfall this month forecast to be above a 30-year average.  “The weather is now perfect with regular rains,” said
Tran Tuyen Huan, Ho Chi Minh City-based general director of Asia
Commodities Joint-Stock Co. “The number of cherries formed on
each branch is higher this year as the trees had some rest last
year when the harvest fell.”  Robusta for September delivery rose 0.6 percent to $1,894 a
ton on NYSE Liffe at 10:25 a.m. in  London . Prices touched a low
of $1,704 on June 14 and a five-month high of $2,216 on March 13.
In Dak Lak province, which represents about 30 percent of
Vietnam’s output, beans cost 39,800 dong ($1.88) a kilogram (2.2
pounds) yesterday,  data  from the Daklak Trade & Tourism Center
show. That’s down from a 17-month high of 45,500 dong in March.  More Rain  The Central Highlands region, which includes Dak Lak, may
get more rain this month than average, the National Center for
Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting said July 1. Buon Ma Thuot, the
capital of Dak Lak, may get as much as 350 millimeters (14
inches), compared with the 30-year average of 266 millimeters.  Unsold beans of the current crop may be 220,000 tons, or 22
percent more than 180,000 tons a year earlier, according to the
survey of traders and shippers. Exports from October to June are
estimated at 1.19 million tons, compared with 1.31 million tons
a year earlier, according to preliminary data from the General
Statistics Office compiled by Bloomberg.  “I didn’t sell much when prices were high because just
like many people, I was greedy and hoping they would go even
higher,” said Tran Thi Loan, a farmer in Dak Lak. “Now that
prices have dropped, I feel sorry and even less motivated to
sell, so I’ll wait for them to go back up again.”  Unsold Beans  Loan said she has kept about a third of the four tons she
harvested from the 2012-2013 crop, more than the year before.  The “Vietnamese are likely to keep holding on to what is
left of the remaining 2012-13 coffee crop, causing premiums to
rise again against London futures,”  Kona Haque , a London-based
analyst at  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) ,  Australia ’s biggest investment
bank, said in a report e-mailed July 9.  Coffee from Indonesia, gathering its 2013-2014 crop, was at
a premium of $230 a ton to the NYSE Liffe price last week,
Volcafe Ltd., the coffee unit of commodities trader ED&F Man
Holdings Ltd., said in a report e-mailed on June 28. Beans from
Vietnam held a premium of $140, data from the trader showed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
