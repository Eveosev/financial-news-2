New Jersey Devils forward  Ilya Kovalchuk  said he is retiring from the  National Hockey League 
after 11 seasons to return home to Russia.  “This decision was something I have thought about for a
long time going back to the lockout and spending the year in
Russia,” Kovalchuk said yesterday in a statement. “The most
difficult thing for me is to leave the New Jersey Devils, a
great organization that I have a lot of respect for, and our
fans that have been great to me.”  Kovalchuk, 30, spent the past four seasons with New Jersey
after being drafted by the  Atlanta Thrashers  with the first pick
in 2001. He had 417 goals and 399 assists in 816 career games.  He had 12 years remaining on a 17-year, $102 million
contract signed in 2010. The front-loaded contract was ruled to
violate terms of the league’s previous collective bargaining
agreement and the Devils were fined $3 million and surrendered
three draft picks, including a first-round pick in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
