China  will remove “unreasonable
fees” and introduce supportive policies for shipping companies
in the second half of the year to help them through an industry
downturn, China National Radio  reported  today, citing a Ministry
of Transport official.  The ministry “is pro-actively striving for a reasonable
tax burden for the shipping industry and, at the same time clean
up unreasonable fees,” Song Dexing, head of the ministry’s
water transport bureau, said in the report.  The plan comes as  Cosco Shipping Co. (600428) , a listed unit of
China’s biggest shipping group, announced yesterday that its
first-half net loss tripled. It didn’t say why.  Data released yesterday showed an unexpected drop in
China’s June exports and imports, underscoring the severity of
the country’s slowdown.  China Rongsheng Heavy Industries Group Holdings Ltd., the
nation’s biggest shipyard outside state control, is seeking
financial help from the government, as the nation’s shipowners
association forecast a slump in vessel orders will run through
next year.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
