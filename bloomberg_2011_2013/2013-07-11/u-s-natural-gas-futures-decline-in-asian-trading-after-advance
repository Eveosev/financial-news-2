Natural gas futures declined in New
York, paring yesterday’s gains.  Gas for August delivery fell as much as 1.1 percent to
$3.641 per million British thermal units in electronic trading
on the New York Mercantile Exchange and was at $3.665 as of
12:10 p.m. in  Singapore . The contract rose 0.6 percent yesterday
to $3.68 on forecasts for above-normal temperatures that would
boost air conditioner use.  Power generation accounts for 32 percent of U.S. gas
demand, according to the Energy Information Administration, the
Energy Department’s statistical arm.  An EIA report scheduled for release today may show gas
stockpiles rose 81 billion cubic feet in the week ended July 5,
according to the median of 13 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
