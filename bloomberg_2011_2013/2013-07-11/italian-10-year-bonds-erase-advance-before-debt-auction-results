Italian 10-year government bonds
erased an advance as the nation sold three- and 30-year
securities at an auction.  Ten-year yields were little changed at 4.44 percent at 9:58
a.m. London time, after declining as much as 10 basis points to
4.35 percent.  Spanish 10-year bonds fell for a fifth day, with the yield
rising four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 4.85
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
