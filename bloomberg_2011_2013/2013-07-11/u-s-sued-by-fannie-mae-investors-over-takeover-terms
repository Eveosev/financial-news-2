(Corrects headline to say suit against the U.S.)  Investors in  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie
Mac  accused the U.S. of depriving them of the value of their
preferred shares when it changed the terms of its takeover of
the mortgage finance companies in August 2012.  The suit, filed in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims by
individual investors represented by Boies Schiller & Flexner LLP
and seeking class action status, is at least the fourth recent
complaint challenging aspects of the bailout.  To contact the reporter on this story:
