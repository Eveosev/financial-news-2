Jain Irrigation Systems Ltd. (JI) , Asia’s
largest irrigation-equipment maker, rose the most in five weeks
after announcing plans to sell wind-farm assets to reduce debt.  Jain, whose drip and sprinkler systems help farmers
irrigate more land with less water, is in talks with a potential
buyer and expects to close the deal in August, helping shrink
foreign currency debt by $10.5 million, it said.  The shares rose 3.7 percent, the most since June 3, after
the company said it’s seeking shareholder approval for the plan
to sell 13.2 megawatts of wind projects built in 2009 in the
southern Indian state of  Tamil Nadu . The gain trimmed the
stock’s loss over the past year to 40 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
