The  Federal Housing Administration 
is increasing the number of borrowers with loans eligible for
streamlined short sales and transactions in which they give up
their properties to avoid foreclosure.  Owners of second homes and those at imminent  default risk 
can gain approval for the two foreclosure alternatives without
submitting documentation substantiating financial hardship, the
FHA said in a notice sent to lenders this week. The option was
previously available only to borrowers living in the mortgaged
property who had already defaulted.  “This is consistent with our efforts to increase
recoveries through FHA loss mitigation by expanding and
strengthening pre-foreclosure and asset disposition
alternatives,” Charles Coulter, deputy assistant secretary for
single-family housing, said in an e-mail.  The FHA, which insures mortgages against default, has been
strengthening its efforts to minimize losses on loans that it
backed as the housing bubble burst. The agency is facing a
nearly $1 billion shortfall in the value of its insurance fund
by the end of the fiscal year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
