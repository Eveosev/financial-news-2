Companies that charge students to
access free federal debt-relief programs should be investigated,
a group of U.S. lawmakers said today in  Washington .  Twenty-three Democratic senators led by  Barbara Boxer  of
California and  Tom Harkin  of  Iowa  called on the Education
Department, the Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau to follow up on a report showing
that companies charged students as much as $1,600 up front and
$50 in monthly fees to take part in federal repayment programs
that are actually free. The senators cited a letter sent to the
heads of the three agencies in an e-mailed statement today.  Debt from student loans  totals more than $1 trillion and
is among the most onerous forms because it can rarely be
canceled through bankruptcy. A National Consumer Law Center
 report  said last month that some debt-relief companies were
capitalizing on desperation and confusion among students
struggling to pay off their debts.  “We are deeply concerned by the report’s findings, which
indicate that some private companies are mischaracterizing
federal student-loan repayment programs as their own and
charging exorbitant fees to enroll people in free government
programs,” the Senators wrote in their letter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
