Greece ’s unemployment rate rose to a
record in April as the economy struggled to emerge from a six-year slump deepened by government spending cuts.  The seasonally adjusted jobless rate rose to 26.9 percent
from 26.8 percent in March, the Athens-based Hellenic
Statistical Authority said in an e-mailed statement today.
That’s in line with the median estimate of three economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. The rate is the highest since the agency
began publishing monthly data in 2004.  The recession in Greece, which was shut out of bond markets
in 2010, has been amplified by austerity measures linked to 240
billion euros ($313 billion) of loans from the euro area and
 International Monetary Fund . Gross domestic product fell 6.4
percent in 2012 and the IMF forecasts it will drop 4.2 percent
this year before output expands 0.6 percent in 2014.  The  unemployment rate  for Greeks between the age of 15 and
24 was 57.5 percent, while the total female joblessness stood at
30.5 percent. The region with the highest unemployment rate was
Epirus-western Macedonia, where 30.2 percent were out of work.  To contact the reporter on this story:
