On most iPhones, iPads and Macs, you'll find  etched in the metal backs : "Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China." Lenovo Group is taking a different path. The Chinese electronics giant, now the world's largest PC maker, recently opened a manufacturing plant in North Carolina.  Bloomberg Television  was given a tour of the facility. The world's largest electronics companies, including those in the U.S., instinctively use Asian labor for assembly. The operations, led by Foxconn Technology Group, are typically cheap and highly skilled. But the practice of sending that work overseas has made these companies punching bags for politicians and pundits trying to explain  America's long-term unemployment crisis .  Apple  and  Google have announced plans  to do limited manufacturing in the U.S. Who could have predicted that a Chinese competitor would beat them to it?
