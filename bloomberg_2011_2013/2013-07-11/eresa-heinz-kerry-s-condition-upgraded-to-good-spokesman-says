Teresa Heinz Kerry’s condition has
been upgraded to “good” from “fair,” and Secretary of State
John Kerry’s wife has been moved from a hospital to a Boston
rehabilitation facility, according to a spokesman.  Doctors have concluded that Heinz Kerry suffered a seizure
on July 7, though they haven’t yet determined its precise cause,
Glen Johnson, a personal spokesman for Kerry, said today in an
e-mail.  For now, Kerry will split his time between Boston and
 Washington , and the top U.S. diplomat will soon resume his
official travel schedule, Johnson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
