Moody’s Investors Service lifted its
forecast for the global speculative-grade default rate to 3.2
percent at year-end from last month’s projection of 3.1 percent.  “Easy liquidity has of course kept the default rate low
for some time,” Albert Metz, managing director of credit policy
research at Moody’s in New York, said today in a statement. “If
funding becomes tighter, we would expect an increase in the
incidence of default.”  Borrowing costs for junk-rated companies have been rising
as the  Federal Reserve  considers curtailing unprecedented
stimulus that’s bolstered credit markets. Yields on the Bank of
America Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Index have climbed to 6.92
percent as of yesterday from a record low 5.98 percent on May 9
and reached 7.15 percent on June 25, the highest since November.  The trailing 12-month global default rate for high-yield,
high-risk debt, ranked below Baa3 by Moody’s and lower than BBB-at  Standard & Poor’s , ended the second quarter at 2.8 percent,
up from 2.5 percent in the prior period and compared with 3.1
percent in the three months ended in June 2012, the ratings
company said.  In the U.S., the default rate on junk-rated debt fell to
2.9 percent in the second quarter from 3 percent in the first
three months of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
