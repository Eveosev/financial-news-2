The U.S. Department of Agriculture
kept its forecast for the 2013 domestic cotton crop unchanged at
13.5 million bales. Analysts expected an increase.  On average, analysts and traders expected a gain to 13.75
million, a Bloomberg survey showed. A year earlier, the  crop 
totaled 17.32 million bales. The U.S. is the world’s top exporter.  Through yesterday, cotton climbed 16 percent this year on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York.  U.S. exports may be 11 million bales in the 12 months that
start Aug. 1, down from 13.3 million in the current season, the
government said. Unsold supplies may drop to 2.9 million, more
than the 2.6 million projected a month ago, and less than 3.9
million a year earlier.  Yields may decline to 831 pounds per acre, more than the 800
pounds projected in June, and down from 887 pounds in the year
ending July 31.  World output will be 118.02 million bales, more than the
117.16 million estimated in June. The prior year’s production was
a revised 121.25 million, the agency said.  Consumption will be 109.79 million bales, less than the
110.17 million forecast a month ago and more than a revised 107.38
million a year earlier. Stockpiles may be 94.34 million, up 10
percent from a revised 85.58 million the previous year. A bale
weighs 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
