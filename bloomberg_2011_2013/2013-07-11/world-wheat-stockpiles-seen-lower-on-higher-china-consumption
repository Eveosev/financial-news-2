Global wheat stockpiles in the year
that started June 1 will be lower than forecast last month on
increased consumption in  China , the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said.  World stockpiles will total 172.38 million metric tons,
down 4.9 percent from 181.25 million forecast in June, the USDA
today in a  monthly report . Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News
forecast 180.59 million tons. Global production will total
697.80 million tons, up from 695.86 expected last month, while
consumption will total 699.89 million tons versus June’s
estimate of 694.48 million tons, USDA data show.  China will produce 121 million tons, the same as forecast
in June, and use 125.50 million, up from 120.5 million forecast
last month, according to the report. Production in  Russia  is
seen at 54 million, the same as in June.  Wheat futures on the  Chicago  Board of Trade through
yesterday plunged 13 percent this year on speculation that
global production would rise.  China, the world’s biggest consumer of the grain, has
bought 1.32 million tons of U.S. wheat since July 3, including
840,000 tons on July 8, USDA data show. The country will import
8.5 million tons in the year that started on June 1, the USDA
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
