Indian (SENSEX)  stocks advanced the most in
two weeks after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said the world’s biggest economy will continue to need stimulus.  The S&P BSE Sensex increased 2 percent to 19,676.06 at the
close in Mumbai, the most since June 28. All but three stocks on
the measure rose.  State Bank of India  rallied the most in more
than a week, pacing gains among lenders. Aluminum producer
 Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL)  climbed 4.7 percent, leading metal
companies higher. Software exporter  Infosys Ltd. (INFO)  gained for the
fourth day before its earnings report tomorrow.  Bernanke backed sustained stimulus in a speech yesterday,
boosting the prospect of the flow of funds to  emerging markets .
 Global investors  sold a net $1 billion of Indian equities and
pulled $8.1 billion from local debt since May 22, when the Fed
signaled it may cut asset purchases this year. The withdrawals
fueled the rupee’s slide to a record and helped the Sensex in
June to its biggest monthly loss since February.  “The hope that the stimulus will not be withdrawn in a
hurry has propped up global markets and we have rejoiced too,”
Mehraboon Jamshed Irani, principal and head of private client
group at Nirmal Bang Securities Ltd., said by telephone from
Mumbai. “The market will continue to be driven by some more
liquidity, which until a month ago was going out.”  Foreign funds have bought a net $174 million of domestic
shares this month through July 10, after pulling $1.8 billion in
June, which was the most since August 2011, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. This year’s net inflows of $13.5 billion into
local shares is the highest in Asia after Japan, the data show.  Lenders Climb  State Bank  advanced 1.9 percent to 1,911.35 rupees, the
steepest climb since July 1.  HDFC Bank Ltd., (HDFCB)  India’s biggest
lender by value, jumped 3.6 percent to 683.25 rupees, the
highest close in a month.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the second-biggest,
added 1.9 percent to 1,057.95 rupees. The S&P BSE Bankex index
of 13 lenders jumped the most in two weeks.  Hindalco Industries Ltd. increased 4.7 percent to 102.8
rupees.  Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. (STLT) , the nation’s largest
copper and zinc maker, increased 4.7 percent to 87.65 rupees.
The two stocks were the top performers on the Sensex.  Tata Steel
Ltd. (TATA) , India’s biggest producer of the alloy, rebounded from a
four-year low, adding 1.9 percent to 261.05 rupees.  Infosys added 1.1 percent to 2,528.35 rupees, rising each
day this week. The company is expected to forecast sales in
dollar terms will rise as much as 7.5 percent in the year to
March, from its earlier projection for as much as 10 percent
growth, according to the median of 10 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey. Infosys will be the first Sensex member to report.  Earnings Outlook  Sensex companies’ profits may increase 5.8 percent in the
three months ended June after two quarters of “near-zero”
growth, Bank of America Corp. said in a July 3 report. Still,
there could be a “risk of disappointment in earnings” because
of a weak rupee, the report said.  The rupee was little changed after climbing as much as 0.5
percent. The currency depreciated to a record 61.2125 on July 8,
making imports costlier and threatening to spur gains in
consumer prices, which have stayed close to 10 percent for more
than a year. Prices climbed 9.3 percent in June, a Bloomberg
survey of economists showed before data due tomorrow.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , the owner of the world’s largest
refining complex, climbed 1.6 percent to 870.05 rupees.  ITC
Ltd. (ITC) , India’s biggest cigarette company, gained 2.3 percent to
353.4 rupees.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , the largest engineering
company, surged 2.4 percent to 964.85 rupees.  The CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange of India
jumped 2 percent to 5,935.10, its highest since June 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
