U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
George Osborne said his deficit-reduction plan can be
achieved without raising taxes after the May 2015 election.  “We have set out the path of fiscal consolidation in the
budget, it says this is going to be done through expenditure,”
Osborne told reporters in  London  today. “There is no need for
tax rises to contribute to that fiscal consolidation.”  Weaker-than-forecast economic growth and tax receipts have
forced Osborne to extend his budget-cutting program to the year
starting April 2017. He had planned to balance the budget this
Parliament. The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies said in
June that taxes will need to rise by 6 billion pounds ($9
billion) after 2015 to meet the government target of an 80
percent to 20 percent split between spending cuts and tax
increases.  “Tax increases are not required,” Osborne told
Parliament’s Treasury Committee today. “It can be achieved with
spending reductions.” He also said tax any cuts should come
from growth in the economy, not from increased borrowing.  “I’m a low-tax Conservative who believes it would be good
to have lower taxes, but I think they need to be sustainably
lower,” he said.  Osborne told reporters tax breaks for married couples will
be announced in his autumn statement, underscoring the pressure
on the Conservative leadership to keep rank-and-file lawmakers
happy ahead of the election. Some Tories say the party is losing
support partly because it isn’t doing enough for traditional
families.  To contact the reporter on this story:
