Commodities climbed for an eighth
day, heading for the longest winning run since 2010, after U.S.
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the economy will
need accommodative monetary policy for the foreseeable future.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials
increased 0.5 percent to 647.36 by 2 p.m. Singapore time, the
highest level since April 3. The daily gains were the longest
streak since November 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Gold rose to the highest in more than two weeks and
oil traded near levels not seen in 15 months.  Minutes of the Fed’s last meeting released yesterday showed
many policy makers want to see more signs that employment is
picking up before they’ll slow bond purchases. Bernanke said
last month the central bank will begin trimming its $85 billion
in monthly bond purchases if the economy continues to improve.
Gold tumbled 22 percent this year, set for the biggest annual
drop since 1981, as the GSCI gauge added 0.1 percent.  “The June FOMC Minutes were relatively dovish,”  Australia
& New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  analysts including  Mark Pervan 
wrote in a note today. The result is a “sharp rally in gold,”
they said. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index surged 2.3 percent as S&P
500 Index futures added 1.1 percent. The  Dollar Index  slumped
1.7 percent.  Gold for immediate delivery gained as much as 3.1 percent
to $1,298.73 an ounce, the highest level since June 24, and was
at $1,296.79. Silver surged 4.6 percent to $20.288 an ounce, the
highest since June 20, while platinum rose 3.1 percent to
$1,411.30 an ounce, also the highest since June 20.  West Texas intermediate oil for August delivery climbed 0.9
percent to $107.41 a barrel from $106.52 yesterday, the highest
close since March 2012. Copper for delivery in three months in
 London  rose 3.2 percent to $7,042.50 a metric ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
