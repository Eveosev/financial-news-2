Crude options volatility declined
after underlying futures retreated even as prices touched higher
highs and higher lows than yesterday.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options, was 22.51 percent on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  as of 3:37 p.m., down from 23.86 percent yesterday.  Volatility jumped almost 2 percentage points yesterday when
crude for September delivery rose 2.9 percent after the Energy
Information Administration reported that  supplies  fell 9.87
million barrels last week to 373.9 million.  West Texas Intermediate crude for September delivery fell
$1.24, or 1.2 percent, to settle at $104.38 a barrel on the
Nymex. The intraday high was $106.53 and the low was $103.73,
compared with yesterday’s range of $105.77 and $103.67. August
futures slipped $1.61, or 1.5 percent, to $104.91.  “After adjusting positions yesterday, because there are
higher highs and higher lows today, people haven’t really jumped
