Indian bonds advanced for a third
day, pushing yields to the lowest level in three weeks, as a
rebound in the nation’s currency eased inflation concerns.  The rupee rose 0.2 percent after Federal Reserve Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday the  U.S. economy  will continue to
need stimulus, boosting the prospect of inflows into  emerging
markets . The currency fell to a record low of 61.2125 on July 8,
making imports costlier and threatening to spur gains in
 consumer-prices , which have stayed close to 10 percent for more
than a year. Prices climbed 9.3 percent in June, a Bloomberg
survey of economists showed before data due tomorrow.  “The recovery in the rupee is providing comfort to the
 bond market ,” said Srinivasa Raghavan, Mumbai-based executive
vice president of treasury at Dhanalaxmi Bank Ltd. “The markets
will keenly watch not just the currency’s movement, but also the
consumer-price inflation data.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell nine
basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 7.57 percent at 10:49
a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system.
The rate, now at its lowest since June 19, climbed 18 basis
points last month, the most since the securities were issued in
June 2012. The yield on the 7.16 percent bonds due March 2023
dropped eight basis points to 7.44 percent.  Reserve Bank  of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao left the
repurchase  rate  unchanged at 7.25 percent on June 17, citing
inflation risks. A sustained 10 percent drop in the rupee adds
150 basis points to 200 basis points to  wholesale-price 
inflation, according to a Standard Chartered Plc research note
last month. Wholesale prices, which are more frequently used for
policy decisions, rose 4.7 percent in May from a year earlier,
the least since 2009, official data show.  U.S. Stimulus  Global funds have  cut holdings  of local bonds by $8.1
billion since May 22, when the U.S. Federal Reserve first
signaled it may pare stimulus. The holdings were at an  all-time
high  on May 21, a day before Bernanke indicated the central
bank’s asset-buying program could be tapered should the U.S. job
market continue to improve. That contributed to the rupee’s 4.9-percent plunge last month, the most since May 2012.  “It is only a  durable receding  of inflation that will open
up the space for monetary policy to continue to address risks to
growth,” the RBI said in its latest policy. The next review is
on July 30.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, slid four basis
points to 7.45 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
