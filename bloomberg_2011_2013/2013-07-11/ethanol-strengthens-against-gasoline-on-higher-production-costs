Ethanol strengthened against
gasoline on concern that higher pre-harvest corn prices are
boosting production costs for producers of the biofuel.  The spread, or price difference, narrowed 2.15 cents to
55.24 cents a gallon as corn for July delivery rose to the
highest level since February. The grain is the primary
ingredient used to make ethanol in the U.S., with one bushel
making at least 2.75 gallons of the fuel.  “The strength in corn is putting pressure on ethanol
production margins and keeps ethanol prices rich,” said Joshua Bailer, managing director of Next Generation Commodities, the
biofuels division of Atlas Commodities LLC in Miami.  Denatured ethanol for August delivery climbed 2.8 cents, or
1.2 percent, to $2.469 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 13 percent this year.  Gasoline for August delivery added 0.65 cent to $3.0214 a
gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol before
delivery to filling stations.  Corn inventories before the start of this year’s harvest
will decline to 729 million bushels, down from 769 million
forecast a month ago and 989 million last year, the U.S.
Agriculture Department estimated today. Last summer’s U.S.
drought, the worst since the 1930’s Dust Bowl, wilted crops and
wiped out returns to make ethanol from the grain.  Corn Prices  Corn for July delivery increased 7 cents, or 1 percent, to
$7.1675 a bushel in Chicago, the highest price for the contract
since Feb. 5.  The corn crush spread, or the cost difference between a
gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, based on
September contracts for the grain and biofuel, was 28 cents,
down from 29 cents yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol  production  last week rose 2.1 percent to 881,000
barrels a day, a U.S. Energy Information Administration report
showed yesterday. That’s 8.5 percent below the record 963,000
barrels a day in December 2011.  Stockpiles of the fuel swelled 1.8 percent to 15.7 million
barrels, rebounding from the lowest level in records going back
three years, the report from the Energy Department’s research
arm showed.  Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, for  corn-based
ethanol  in the U.S. slipped 2 cents to $1.13 from the previous
day’s record high, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Advanced
RINs, which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based
ethanol, also dropped from a record, falling 2 cents to $1.16.  The RINs are used to track adherence to a federal law
requiring the use of 13.8 billion gallons of ethanol this year.  Bailer said increasing imports would have “only so much
effect” on supply. The U.S.  imported  25,000 barrels of the fuel
last week, compared to none a week earlier, the EIA said.  Anhydrous ethanol in  Sao Paulo  cost $2.22 a gallon as of
July 5, the lowest price since Nov. 9, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 91 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool last week, down from 94 percent the
previous week, according to EIA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
