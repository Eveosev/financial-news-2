Australia leads England by 14 runs
at lunch on day two of the Ashes series opener as teenager
Ashton Agar became the first No. 11 to score a half-century in
his Test cricket debut.  Agar is 69 not out from 68 balls at Trent Bridge in
Nottingham. The 19-year-old and  Phil Hughes , whoâ€™s on 63, have
teamed for a 112-run partnership to carry Australia to 229-9 at
the break. The visitors lost five wickets for nine runs in the
first hour after starting the day at 75-4.  James Anderson  took three wickets and Graeme Swann claimed
two in the early England flurry. Anderson took 5-70.  England, which was bowled out yesterday for 215, is seeking
to win its third consecutive Ashes series.  To contact the reporter on this story:
