Wheat futures rose, capping the
longest rally in almost four months, after the  U.S. Department
of Agriculture  cut its forecast for domestic stockpiles by 13
percent amid rising exports.  Inventories will be 576 million bushels in the year that
started on June 1, down from 659 million projected last month,
the government said. The export forecast jumped 10 percent,
while the production estimate rose 1.6 percent, Last week,
shipments from the U.S. more than doubled from a week earlier,
the USDA said in a separate report, while  China  bought 1.32
million metric tons since July 3.  “The potential is there for bigger exports, and combining
that with the China news and outstanding export sales today, it
adds a little fire for everybody” betting on a rally,  Jason Britt , the president of Central States Commodities Inc. in
 Kansas City ,  Missouri , said in a telephone interview.  Wheat futures for September delivery rose 0.6 percent to
settle at $6.83 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The price rose for the fourth straight session, the
longest advance since March 14. Earlier, the grain jumped as
much as 2.1 percent.  Export sales by the U.S., the world’s top shipper, surged
to 1.47 million tons in the week that ended on July 4 from
593,000 tons a week earlier. Analysts forecast sales of 550,000
tons to 1.5 million tons.  The USDA’s estimate for China’s imports more than doubled
to 8.5 million tons from the June forecast.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, hay
and wheat, USDA data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
