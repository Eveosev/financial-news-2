Seasonal temperatures are expected
to dominate the U.S. East Coast in late July while heat builds
across the Great Plains and  Texas , said Matt Rogers, president
of the Commodity Weather Group LLC.  Temperatures may range 3 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit (1.7 to
2.8 Celsius) above normal in Texas, the Plains and parts of the
West from July 21 to July 25, according to Rogers in Bethesda,
Maryland. The rest of the U.S. should remain seasonal.  “By late next week, that heat ridge is already retreating
again, opening the door for rain/cloud risks that could again
hamper high temperatures,” Rogers said in a note to clients.  High temperatures in large U.S. cities can affect energy
markets as more people turn to air conditioners to keep cool.
Natural gas will be used to fuel about 32 percent of power
plants this year, according to the Energy Information
Administration.  Seasonal weather in the East will come after another round
of heat, which is expected to drive temperatures at least 5
degrees above normal from  Michigan  across  Pennsylvania  and
Ontario and into New York and New England from July 16 to July
20, Rogers said. The South is expected to remain seasonal.  The normal average reading for July 22 in New York City is
about 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 Celsius), according to the
National Weather Service. In  Boston , it’s 74; Washington, 80;
 Chicago , 74; Los Angeles, 79; and in Houston, 85.  To contact the reporter on this story:
