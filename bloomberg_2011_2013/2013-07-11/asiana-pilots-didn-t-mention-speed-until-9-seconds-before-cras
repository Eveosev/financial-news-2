The pilots of Asiana Flight 214 made
no mention of the plane’s speed in its final moments until less
than nine seconds before it hit a seawall, U.S. National
Transportation Safety Board Chairman  Deborah Hersman  said.  From the time the plane descended below 500 feet, the first
mention of speed is heard after an automated system called out
an altitude of 100 feet, Hersman said at the board’s last
briefing on the accident today.  There were two calls by pilots to abort the landing -- one
three seconds before impact and the second 1 1/2 seconds later
by another crew member, she said. Hersman previously described
only the second call.  One of the pilots can be heard warning, before the plane
reached 500 feet, that they were descending too quickly, Hersman
said. That altitude is the point at which  Boeing Co. (BA)  advises
pilots that they must have the plane in the correct alignment or
abort the landing.  The plane reached 500 feet about 34 seconds before the
crash, Hersman said at an earlier briefing.  There’s no evidence on the plane’s data recorder that the
automatic throttle malfunctioned, Hersman said. That device on
the  Boeing 777  is designed to hold the speed and includes an
emergency mode to prevent pilots from getting too slow.  Safety features on the plane appear to have functioned as
designed, Hersman said. The fuel tanks didn’t break open, she
said. Fires around the jet were fed by an engine that broke
loose and other flammable material, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
