The yen may slide another 18 percent
as the Bank of  Japan ’s efforts to expand the  money supply  spur
domestic investors to shift assets overseas, according to Credit
Suisse Group AG.  The yen’s 20 percent drop since the middle of November
completed the first stage of its “normalization,” which will
continue until the currency reaches 120 per dollar in 12 months,
according to  Ray Farris , global head of currency strategy at
Credit Suisse. The CHART OF THE DAY shows the yen remains
stronger than its average of 116.6 per dollar from 1990 to 2008,
before the global financial crisis and Japan’s record 2011
earthquake triggered the currency’s surge to post-war highs.  “The yen can weaken a lot more in terms of its historical
valuations,” Farris said in an e-mailed response to questions.
The combination of continued monetary easing by Japan’s central
bank while the  Federal Reserve  gets closer to tapering stimulus
“should amplify the effect of the BOJ’s policy on the yen.”  Japan’s central bank today retained its plan to increase
the monetary base by 60 trillion yen ($609 billion) to 70
trillion yen per year, and said the economy was starting to
recover “moderately.” The BOJ may eventually boost stimulus
measures to achieve the inflation goal of 2 percent, and its
buying of local assets will compel Japanese investors to seek
alternatives in a “slow, gradual process,” Farris wrote.  Ministry of Finance data today showed Japanese  bought  973.1
billion yen in overseas bonds in the week through July 5,
snapping seven weeks of net sales that made for record
divestitures in the first half. That trend defied the
“portfolio shift” into foreign securities that BOJ Governor
Haruhiko Kuroda predicted would occur amid central bank easing.  Credit Suisse’s forecast of 120 per dollar is the third-most bearish view among estimates for the yen compiled by
Bloomberg for the second quarter of 2014, with the median call
at 109. Japan’s currency is expected to finish 2013 at 105,
according to projections compiled by Bloomberg, compared with
98.51 as of 2:30 p.m. in Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
