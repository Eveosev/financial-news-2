U.S. wheat stockpiles in the year
that started June 1 will be lower than forecast last month as
exports increase, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said.  Stockpiles will total 576 million bushels, down 12.6
percent from 659 million forecast in June, the USDA today in a
monthly report. Analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News  forecast 627
million (17.06 million metric tons). The U.S. will export 1.075
billion bushels, up from 975 million estimated last month,
according to the report. Production will total 2.114 billion
bushels, up from the 2.08 billion projected in June.  Wheat futures on the Chicago Board of Trade through
yesterday plunged 13 percent this year on speculation that
global production would rise.  Hard-red winter wheat production in the 12 months that
started on June 1 will total 792.7 million bushels, down from
1.004 billion a year earlier, the USDA said in its first
forecast of production by class for the marketing year. Soft-red
winter output will rise 28.4 percent to 538.9 million bushels,
from 419.8 million in 2012, according to the report.  Hard-red spring wheat production will be 476.3 million
bushels, down from 504.5 million, the government said. Output of
white spring varieties will fall to 36.7 million bushels from
37.4 million last year, and durum production will fall to 57.5
million bushels from 82 million last year, USDA data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
