Britain’s Broadmoor Hospital, whose
patients include Peter Sutcliffe, known as the Yorkshire Ripper
after a spate of murders, will get a 115 million-pound ($173
million) makeover by homebuilder and construction company  Kier
Group Plc. (KIE)   The contract includes the construction of a 162-bed
hospital to replace the current facilities that date back 150
years, said Bedfordshire-based Kier, which has been named
preferred bidder for the work.  “Kier has a proven track record of delivering highly
complex projects,” Managing Director Colin Lamb said by email.  Broadmoor, located in Crowthorne, southern  England , is the
best known of Britain’s high-security psychiatric hospitals with
a catchment area spanning London as well as counties in the
southeast and southwest.  For Kier, the contract adds to about 1.4 billion pounds
($2.1 billion) in new contracts at its construction unit this
year, in which it has bought services provider May Gurney.
William Shirley, an analyst at Liberium Capital, said it’s
“very encouraging” that the order book for 2014 was 10 percent
to 15 percent higher than this time last year.  Shares of Kier rose 0.6 percent to 1,385 pence as of 12:47
p.m. in  London . The company has advanced 4.5 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
