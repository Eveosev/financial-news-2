SMU SA, the Chilean retailer
controlled by the billionaire Alvaro Saieh, plans to increase
its capital by $500 million after an accounting review revealed
higher losses and a breach of debt covenants.  The company said in a regulatory filing that its financial
statements for the first quarter showed that the company had
been undervaluing its store-lease obligations by 38 billion
pesos ($75 million), which led to an increase of its total
liabilities and a 4.4 percent cut in its earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization for the 12 months
through March 31.  As a result, SMU’s debt-coverage ratio, defined by Ebitda
divided by net financial expenses, fell to 1.4 times, below the
threshold of 1.5 times defined in the terms for its bonds,
according to the filing.  “This situation doesn’t constitute an immediate cause for
an acceleration of payments,” Chief Executive Officer Marcelo Galvez said in the filing.  The yield on SMU’s dollar bonds due in 2020 rose 1.5
percentage points today to 13.8 percent, according to Trace, the
bond-pricing reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
