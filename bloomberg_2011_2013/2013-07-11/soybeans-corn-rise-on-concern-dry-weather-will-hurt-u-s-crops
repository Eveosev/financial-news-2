Soybean futures rallied for a fourth
straight day and corn rose on speculation that warmer, drier
weather in the Midwest will increase stress on the two biggest
crops in the U.S., the world’s largest grower.  Much of the Midwest will be drier over the next 10 days,
with temperatures above normal for part of the period, based on
midday data from the  National Weather Service , said Joel Widenor, a vice president for Commodity Weather Group LLC in
Bethesda,  Maryland . About 25 percent of the corn and soybean
fields will see stress after some areas received less than 50
percent of normal precipitation over the past 30 days, he said.  “The threat of hot, dry weather and how long it may last
helped to increase buying” and will “boost the futures-market
weather premium,”  Shawn McCambridge , the senior grain analyst
for Jefferies Bache LLC in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview. “The biggest crop concerns are focused on the
western Midwest, where rains have been more limited.”  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 0.4 percent to
$12.9025 a bushel at 12:41 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade,
heading for the first four-day advance since May 23.  Corn futures for December delivery, after the harvest,
advanced 0.6 percent to $5.245 a bushel.  Earlier, prices fell after the U.S. said record domestic
harvests in 2013 will more than double inventories, as farmers
recover from a drought last year that sent prices to all-time
highs.  Stockpiles of corn on Aug. 31, 2014, will total 1.959
billion bushels, up from 1.949 billion forecast in June and an
estimated 729 million for this year, the USDA said in a  report .
The agency also cut its export forecast. Soybean reserves will
jump to 295 million bushels from this year’s estimate of 125
million, the USDA said.  After a drought last year that was the worst since the
1930s, growers will expand corn production by 29 percent to a
record 13.95 billion bushels, the USDA said. Soybean output will
jump 13 percent to an all-time high of 3.42 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
