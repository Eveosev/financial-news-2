Rival rock shows featuring  Justin Timberlake  and Lionel Richie, a jilted Zoe Wanamaker, views of Paris, and the first night of the Proms are our choices for London this weekend.  STAGE  A 25-year marriage goes pear-shaped when the husband meets a younger woman.  So far, so familiar. What makes “Passion Play” special is that the husband and wife each have a flesh-and-blood alter-ego on stage -- dressed like them, and voicing their inner thoughts.  The young serial seductress is not the most plausible character in Peter Nichols’s 1981 play. Yet Wanamaker and Owen Teale, supported by their doppelgangers, make “Passion Play” an all-too-real picture of conjugal life.  Only three more weeks to go before the production ends (Aug. 3) at the Duke of York’s Theatre. For more information:  http://www.atgtickets.com  or +44-844-871-7615.  DINING  If the sunshine puts you in holiday mood, now may be a good time to visit Pizarro, in Bermondsey. This Spanish restaurant is adding a Sunday breakfast menu (from 10 a.m.) this weekend. It may include omelette with courgette and mint; and baked eggs with peas and chorizo. Also on offer: torrija -- bread soaked in orange juice, lightly fried and served with vanilla ice-cream.

Mele e Pere is an Italian restaurant that is so low-key, you might be a Soho regular and still not be aware it’s there. This trattoria is worth getting to know. Regional dishes are served with homemade vermouth and a wide range of Italian wines. Information:  http://www.meleepere.co.uk/  or +44-20-7096-2096.  VISUAL ARTS  The British passion for Paris hasn’t faded in 200 years.  See evidence of that in a quaint watercolor show at the  Wallace Collection  -- with works by J.M.W. Turner and obscure travelers alike.  Note Thomas Girtin’s view of a deserted Rue Saint Denis, later to become the capital’s red-light district; and Ambrose Poynter’s sketch of a woman hauling a pile of baguettes on her back (the baguette had only just been introduced in  France ).  “The Discovery of Paris” will make you want to hop across the Channel. It ends Sept. 15 at the Wallace Collection, Manchester Square, London W1U 3BN. For more information:  http://www.wallacecollection.org  or +44-20-7563-9500.  MUSIC  Elton John is off the lineup, though there are plenty of other stars to keep rock fans happy at rival events on the east and west of London this weekend.  Sir Elton canceled his British Summer Time festival appearance in Hyde Park because of appendicitis. Friday’s show goes on with Ray Davies and  Elvis Costello  on the bill. Saturday features the  Rolling Stones  -- in what may be the band’s last live show -- and Sunday’s lineup includes Lionel Richie. Moms and dads will be happy.  The kids may prefer the decidedly more edgy roster at the Wireless Festival at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, topped by Justin Timberlake and Jay-Z.
