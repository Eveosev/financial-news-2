Soaring prices in Switzerland’s
domestic property market and pressure on profitability are
weighing on a “stable” rating for Swiss banks, Moody’s
Investors Service said.  “There are increasing indications of overly-high asset-price inflation in Swiss real-estate markets,” Moody’s analysts
Michael Rohr and Carola Schuler said in an e-mailed report from
 Frankfurt  today. “That has the potential to significantly
impact Swiss banks’ asset quality and capital ratios in an
adverse scenario.”  Earnings at Swiss regional banks would suffer from loan-loss charges in the event of an unexpectedly large slowdown in
Swiss property markets, potentially damaging their capital
position, according to Moody’s.  Switzerland’s 24 cantonal banks, most of which were
established in the 19th century, had assets in excess of 500
billion francs ($527 billion) at the end of December, according
to the  Swiss Cantonal Banks Association .  The impact of low interest rates and possible fines from a
U.S. probe of Swiss wealth managers suspected of helping tax
dodgers also pose significant challenges, New York-based Moody’s
said.  Still, Moody’s outlook for Swiss banks remains at
“stable” as lenders have low levels of problem loans, strong
capital ratios, limited reliance on wholesale funding and the
ability to absorb losses through earnings and loan-loss
reserves, Moody’s said. The Swiss government’s creditworthiness
and low unemployment in the country also contribute to a stable
environment, according to the firm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
