Auction.com, a real estate sales
service partly owned by Barry Sternlicht, hired Rick Sharga as
executive vice president from Carrington Holding Co.  Auction.com, based in  Irvine ,  California , has sold more
than $20 billion of commercial and residential real estate,
including foreclosed properties and luxury homes, through online
and live auctions since it was established in 1991, according to
its website.  “I don’t think the Internet’s had its full impact on real
estate yet,” Sharga, 53, said in a telephone interview. “This
company’s at the forefront of that change.”  Sharga, who will be the chief spokesman for Auction.com,
joined Carrington, a Greenwich, Connecticut-based mortgage and
real estate services company founded by Bruce Rose, in September
2011. He previously worked at RealtyTrac, where he was an often-quoted commentator on the U.S. foreclosure crisis.  Sternlicht’s  Starwood Property Trust Inc. (STWD)  and Starwood
Capital Group LLC acquired their stake in Auction.com through a
$1.06 billion purchase of LNR Property LLC that was completed in
April. Auction.com’s  website  also lists Stone Point Capital, a
private-equity fund led by former Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
executives Stephen Friedman and Charles A. Davis, as an
investor.  To contact the reporters on this story:
