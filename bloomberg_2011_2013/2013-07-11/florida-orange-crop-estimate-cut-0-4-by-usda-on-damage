The U.S. Department of Agriculture
reduced its estimate for  Florida ’s orange crop by 0.4 percent
because of damage from citrus greening, a bacterial disease.  In the season that started Oct. 1, the state may collect
133.4 million boxes, down from 134 million projected last month,
the USDA said today in a report. On average, analysts and traders
expected the agency to cut the estimate to 133.83 million, a
Bloomberg News survey showed. A year earlier, output was 146.7
million. Florida is the world’s biggest orange grower after
 Brazil .  “The reduction will be mostly due to the ongoing problems
with citrus greening, which continues to hurt the crop,” John
Ortelle, a vice president with McKeanny Flavell Co., a broker in
Oakland,  California , said in a telephone interview before the
report.  Through yesterday, orange-juice futures in New York jumped 15
percent this year. The bulk of the Florida orange harvest occurs
through July.  Citrus greening starves a tree of nutrients, causing fruit to
shrink and drop prematurely. The disease has been found in all of
Florida’s 32 counties that produce the fruit commercially. Before
today, the agency had trimmed the estimate six times since the
start of the current season in October.  Yields will average 1.59 gallons per box, down from 1.63
gallons a year earlier, the USDA said. A box weighs 90 pounds, or
41 kilograms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
