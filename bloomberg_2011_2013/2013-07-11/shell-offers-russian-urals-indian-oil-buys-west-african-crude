Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  failed to sell
Russian Urals in northwest Europe at a lower differential. No
bids or offers were made for  North Sea  Forties crude.  Shell, Chevron Corp. and Total SA sold 4 million barrels of
West African crude to Indian Oil Corp., the nation’s largest
refiner, for loading in September, said three traders who asked
not to be identified because the information is confidential.  North Sea  There were no bids or offers for Brent, Oseberg or Ekofisk.
Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time.  Shell yesterday sold Forties F0719 for loading July 29 to
July 31 at a premium of 50 cents a barrel to Dated Brent, a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window showed. That is the same as the price for a cargo
it sold July 8, which was the highest since Feb. 8.  Brent for August settlement traded at $107.93 a barrel on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $108.21 in the previous session. The September
contract was at $107.18 at the same time today, a discount of 75
cents to August.  Mediterranean/Urals  Shell failed to sell 100,000 metric tons of Urals for
loading Aug. 1 to Aug. 5 at 55 cents a barrel more than Dated
Brent on a delivered basis to Rotterdam, according to the
survey. This compares with an offer that was withdrawn at a
premium of 70 cents yesterday.  Urals in the Mediterranean rose to a premium of 77 cents a
barrel to Dated Brent yesterday, which was the highest since at
least July 1991, when Bloomberg started tracking the data.  PKN Orlen SA, Poland’s largest oil company, bought 100,000
tons of Urals for July 28 to Aug. 1 delivery to Butinge  oil
terminal  in  Lithuania  from Vitol Group, according to three
people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be
identified because the information is confidential. The cargo
was bought at a premium of about 50 to 55 cents a barrel to
Dated Brent, two of them said.  West Africa  Total didn’t manage to sell Cabinda for Aug. 2 to Aug. 3
loading at $1 a barrel less than Dated Brent, the survey showed.
The company started offering the cargo on June 28 at a premium
of 30 cents.  Indian Oil purchased via a tender 1 million barrels each of
the Angolan Girassol and Nigerian Forcados grades from Shell,
three traders said. Chevron will supply the company 1 million
barrels of  Nigeria ’s Agbami, while Total will provide the Amenam
variety from the West African nation, they said.  Nigeria’s Usan oil field will pump 180,000 barrels a day by
the end of this year, from current 130,000 barrels, Abiye
Membere, group executive director of Nigerian National Petroleum
Corp., said today in Beijing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
