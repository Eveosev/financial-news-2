The U.K. government referred  G4S Plc (GFS) 
to the  Serious Fraud Office , saying it overcharged for
electronic tagging services, including claims for monitoring
dead people.  Serco Group Plc (SRP)  also agreed to a forensic audit of all its
contracts with the government after irregularities were found
over payments to it and G4S for tagging prisoners released on
license and defendants released on bail, Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling told lawmakers in the House of Commons today. The SFO
was asked to investigate G4S after the company refused to
cooperate with an audit, Grayling said.  “There are a number of cases where charging continued for
a period when subjects were known to have died,” Grayling said.
“This is a wholly indefensible and unacceptable state of
affairs.”  Payments which “run into the low tens of millions of
pounds” have been made to the two companies since 2004 for
people who were not being monitored, had returned to jail and
left the country, as well as those who were dead, Grayling said,
citing an audit of billing arrangements he ordered on May 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
