Hong Kong â€™s Education Bureau has
allocated the ex-Victoria Road detention center site to the
University of Chicago Booth School of Business, according to a
statement on the government website today.  The institution plans to offer its Executive Master of
Business Administration program and other courses at the
location, the statement said.  Booth won the bid for the Hong Kong Heritage site and will
relocate its Asia branch to the city from Singapore,  Ming Pao
