Hong Kong stocks rose, with the
city’s  equity benchmark  headed for a three-week high, after
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the U.S. needs to
maintain accommodative stimulus for the foreseeable future.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  climbed 1.4 percent to 21,204.13 as of
9:45 a.m. in Hong Kong, advancing a third day as all but four
stocks rose on the 50-member gauge. The Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index, down more than 20 percent from the year’s
high, gained 1.9 percent to 9,394.31.  Bernanke yesterday said low inflation and high unemployment
mean the Fed needs to press on with stimulus. He said he expects
inflation to “come back up” closer to the central bank’s 2
percent goal.  Minutes released the same day from the central bank’s June
meeting showed that while a reduction in asset purchases “would
likely soon be warranted,” many officials want to see more
signs employment is picking up before slowing the pace of $85
billion in monthly bond purchases. Last week’s Labor Department
jobs report for June beat expectations, with 195,000 jobs added
and the unemployment rate unchanged at 7.6 percent.  The Hang Seng Index posted its  biggest monthly decline  in a
year last month, declining 7.1 percent as  China ’s money-market
rates surged to record and after Bernanke said policy makers may
start dialing down stimulus if the U.S. economy shows sustained
improvement.  China Shares  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, also known as the H-share index, closed 25 percent below its Feb. 1 high yesterday,
with a 20 percent drop meeting some investors’ definition of a
bear market. The  measure traded  at 1.11 times the value of net
assets, near levels not seen since the depths of the 2008 global
financial crisis.  Shares on  benchmark  Hang Seng Index traded at 9.9 times
estimated earnings yesterday, compared with 15 times for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 13.1 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Resources and energy companies  lead declines this year on
the Hang Seng Composite Index, the city’s broadest equity
measure. The gauge fell 8.6 percent since the end of December
through yesterday, with information technology and utilities the
only sectors to gain among 11 industry groups.  Earnings Season  Futures on the S&P 500 gained 0.9 percent today. The index
rose less than 0.1 percent yesterday in New York, with Family
Dollar Stores Inc. leading gains as the retailer’s earnings
topped analyst estimates.  Hang Seng Index futures advanced 1.8 percent to 21,234. The
HSI Volatility Index slid 6.2 percent to 20.89, indicating
traders expect a swing of 6 percent for the equity benchmark in
the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
