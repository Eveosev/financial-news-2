The rising death toll from the July
6 train derailment and explosion in Lac-Megantic,  Quebec  has
made the incident the worst Canadian train disaster in more than
103 years.  A  Montreal , Maine & Atlantic Railway Ltd. train carrying 72
carloads of crude rolled from an overnight parking spot into the
town, about 250 kilometers (155 miles) east of Montreal, where
it derailed and exploded, razing about 30 buildings. Twenty
bodies have been recovered and a total of about 50 people are
“probably dead,” Chief Inspector Michel Forget of the  Surete
du Quebec  police, said yesterday.  That toll would put the Quebec incident as the deadliest
train disaster since Jan. 21, 1910, when the back half of a
 Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP)  passenger train derailed, killing
63 at Spanish River, Ontario. The train, heading for
 Minneapolis , came off the tracks after it struck the end of a
bridge, according to a government  database .  Lac-Megantic’s fatalities surpass other train disasters in
 Canada  in the past century, including a Dec. 27, 1942 accident
when a troop train smashed into the rear of a packed passenger
train in darkness at a station in Almonte, Ontario, killing 36.  A Sept. 1, 1947 crash between two passenger trains in
Dugald, Manitoba killed 31 people, and a collision between
a  Canadian National Railway Co. (CNR)  freight train and a VIA Rail
passenger train near Hinton, Alberta on Feb. 8, 1986 killed
23 people, according to the database.  Halifax Explosion  Among the worst rail disasters in Canadian history was near
 Mont-Saint-Hilaire , Quebec on June 29, 1864 when a passenger
train traveling to Montreal from  Quebec City  failed to stop as
it approached an open swing bridge over the Richelieu River and
plunged into the water, killing an estimated 99 people.  The blast from Lac-Megantic’s train crash is also among the
deadliest in Canada since the Halifax  explosion  on Dec. 6, 1917,
when the French munitions freighter Mont-Blanc collided with a
relief ship in the city’s harbor. The Mont-Blanc caught fire and
exploded, devastating Halifax and Dartmouth. The blast killed
1,963 people, injured 9,000 and destroyed 1,600 buildings, and
left 6,000 people homeless, according to Public Safety Canada.  To contact the reporter on this story:
