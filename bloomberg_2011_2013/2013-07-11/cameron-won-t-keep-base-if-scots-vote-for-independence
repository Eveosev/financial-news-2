U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron
won’t back plans to keep the Scottish base housing nuclear-armed
submarines as U.K. territory if  Scotland  votes for independence
in a referendum next year, his office said.  The Guardian newspaper reported today that the government
was considering ensuring that the Faslane base on the River
Clyde west of Glasgow, housing the Trident nuclear deterrent,
had the same status as British sovereign bases in Cyprus. If the
base has to be closed, the cost of moving it to England or  Wales 
could form part of any independence settlement with Scotland’s
nationalist government if it wins the vote, the newspaper said.  No such idea has been presented to the premier or Defence
Secretary Philip Hammond, Cameron’s office said in an e-mailed
statement, saying it would not be a “credible or sensible”
course of action.  The Guardian quoted an unnamed defense source as saying
that the idea of a sovereign base would be an option to avoid
the cost of decommissioning the Faslane base, which could run
into tens of billions of pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
