Former Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc.
Chairman Harry Sloan and film financier Jeff Sagansky plan to
raise $250 million for media and entertainment acquisitions,
their second media-focused public offering.  Silver Eagle Acquisition Corp. (EAGLU)  intends to sell 25 million
units at $10 each, and may add another 3.75 million units if
there’s enough demand, according to a statement today. Each unit
will consist of one share and a warrant to buy a half-share for
$5.75, the company said.  Sagansky and Sloan partnered to raise $190 million in 2011
to create  Global Eagle Entertainment (ENT) , a company specializing in
providing wireless Internet and in-flight entertainment systems
for airlines. Global Eagle Entertainment’s customers include
 Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) , United Airlines Inc. and Japan Airlines
Co. Global Eagle in June  agreed  to a joint venture with China
Telecom Satellite Communications Co. to deliver content to
Chinese carriers.  Like Global Eagle Entertainment, Silver Eagle will be a
unit of Global Eagle Acquisition LLC, according to the
statement.  Silver Eagle has applied to have its units listed on the
Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol EAGLU, according to a
regulatory filing. Deutsche Bank AG is running the deal, the
filing showed.  Shares of Global Eagle Entertainment were unchanged at
$10.30 today in Nasdaq trading. The stock has gained 3.6 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
