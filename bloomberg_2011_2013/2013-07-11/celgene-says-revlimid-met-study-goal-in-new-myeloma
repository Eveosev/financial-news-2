Celgene Corp. (CELG)  rose to a record after
its Revlimid cancer drug met the goal of a study aimed at
showing the medicine could be an initial treatment for patients
with multiple myeloma.  Revlimid, with $3.8 billion in  revenue  last year, is
approved for use in combination with dexamethasone in patients
who have tried at least one other therapy. Based on the study
results, the Summit, New Jersey-based company said in a
statement today it plans to submit applications for expanded
approval of the drug in the U.S.,  Europe  and other markets.  Revlimid plus dexamethasone helped patients live longer
without their cancer progressing than a combination of
melphalan, prednisone and thalidomide, Celgene said. The study,
from the third and final stage of testing generally required for
approval, was in 1,623 patients. Celgene said it plans to
present further results at a medical meeting.  “This result is in line with our expectations,” Joel Sendek, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus & Co., wrote in a note
to clients today. “However, Celgene is waiting for a future
medical meeting to disclose numerical data for progression free
survival, overall survival, and second primary malignancies --
data that we see as important for gauging the commercial
implications.”  Celgene gained 7.9 percent to $134.92 at 4 p.m.  New York 
time for its highest closing price since the shares began
trading in 1987. The shares have increased 72 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
