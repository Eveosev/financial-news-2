Bridgepoint Education Inc. (BPI) , the for-profit college majority-owned by Warburg Pincus LLC, rose as
much as 27 percent in early trading after its Ashford University
unit received accreditation approval yesterday.  The college was granted initial accreditation for five
years by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges after
responding to concerns about how it operated, according to a
statement yesterday. Ashford had been denied approval last year
after failing to comply with standards in areas including
student retention and maintaining a core of full-time faculty.  “We believe this removes a substantial overhang” for
Bridgepoint, Jeff Silber, a BMO Capital Markets analyst in New
York, wrote in a note today. He rates the stock market perform,
the equivalent of hold.  Bridgepoint rose 25 percent to $15.75 at 8:34 a.m. in  New
York  and earlier climbed to $16.06. The San Diego-based
company’s stock had added 22 percent this year through
yesterday’s close, while the Russell 2000 Index advanced 20
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
