The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will increase shipments by the most this
year as summer demand for driving fuels in the northern
hemisphere nears its peak, according to Oil Movements.  The group, which supplies about 40 percent of the world’s
oil, will ship 24.32 million barrels a day in the four weeks to
July 27, up by 630,000 barrels, or 2.7 percent, from 23.69
million in the period to June 29, the tanker tracker said today
in an e-mailed report. It’s the biggest gain in 2013 and brings
exports to near their highest level of the year, according to
the consultant. The figures exclude two of OPEC’s 12 members,
 Angola  and  Ecuador .  “By and large this is it, the interval from mid-July to
early August is where the peak occurs,”  Roy Mason , the
company’s founder, said today by phone from Halifax, England.
“There’s certainly a revival in refining after prolonged
maintenance and low demand in the second quarter. A lot is going
east, but there’s an awful lot going west as well.”  Middle Eastern shipments will climb by 3.5 percent to 17.98
million barrels a day to July 27, compared with 17.38 million in
the month to June 29, according to Oil Movements. That figure
includes non-OPEC nations Oman and Yemen.  Crude on board tankers will increase by 5.9 percent to
494.07 million barrels versus 466.36 million, data from Oil
Movements show. The researcher calculates the volumes by
tallying tanker bookings. Its figures exclude crude held on
vessels for storage.  OPEC’s members are  Algeria , Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
 Kuwait , Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. It will next meet in Vienna on Dec. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
