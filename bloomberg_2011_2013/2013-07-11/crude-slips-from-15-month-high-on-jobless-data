West Texas Intermediate crude
slipped from a 15-month high as more Americans than expected
filed for  unemployment benefits  and the  International Energy
Agency  predicted global supply will outstrip demand growth.  Prices dropped the most in almost three weeks after the
Labor Department said jobless claims rose to a two-month high in
the week ended July 6. Oil production in non-OPEC countries will
expand at the fastest pace in 20 years in 2014, the IEA said.
Oil has jumped 8.6 percent this month on concern that  Egypt ’s
political upheaval will disrupt Middle East exports.  “You had a weak jobs report and it’s not supportive for
demand,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at the Price
Futures Group in  Chicago . “After the incredible run, we don’t
have that next piece of bullish news to keep the market higher.
We are taking some of the Egypt premiums out of the price.”  WTI for August delivery declined $1.61, or 1.5 percent, to
settle at $104.91 a barrel on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange.
It climbed to $107.45 a barrel earlier, the highest intraday
price since March 27, 2012. The volume of all WTI futures traded
was 59 percent above the 100-day average for the time of day at
3:37 p.m.  Brent for August settlement slid 78 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to end the session at $107.73 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures  Europe  exchange. Volume was 22 percent above 100-day
average.  WTI’s discount to Brent, the European benchmark, widened to
$2.82, based on settlement prices. It shrank in intraday trading
to as little as $1.32 a barrel, the smallest gap since Nov. 15,
2010. The retreat in WTI futures allowed the grade’s discount to
North Sea Brent to widen again.  Technical Indicator  WTI’s 14-day relative strength index of front-month
contracts settled above 70 a fifth day, data compiled by
Bloomberg showed. Some investors start selling contracts when
the reading crosses that threshold, seen as a sign that
speculative buying has driven prices unreasonably high.  “The market is technically overbought,”  Addison Armstrong , director of market research at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut , said in an e-mail.  First-time jobless claims rose by 16,000 to 360,000 last
week, the Labor Department said. The  median  forecast of 47
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a drop to 340,000.
The  four-week  moving average, a less volatile measure than the
weekly figures, climbed to 351,750 last week from 345,750.  The U.S., the world’s biggest oil consuming country, used
about a fifth of the world’s oil last year, according to  BP
Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical Review of World Energy.  U.S. Demand  U.S. petroleum  consumption  dropped 1.15 million barrels a
day, or 5.7 percent, in the week ended July 5 to 19.2 million,
the first decline in four weeks, the Energy Information
Administration reported yesterday. That’s also the biggest
decrease in barrels since Aug. 17.  “We know that there isn’t much demand growth,” Flynn
said. Prices are having “a correction after the big rally.”  World oil consumption will climb by 1.2 million barrels a
day next year, the Paris-based IEA said in its first monthly
report with forecasts for 2014. Supplies from outside the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will jump by 1.3
million barrels a day amid booming output in North America,
curbing the need for crude from the 12-member producer group,
according to the report.  “The IEA report is highlighting a bearish bias relative to
the supply-demand balance as they introduce for the first time a
view for 2014,” said  Harry Tchilinguirian , BNP’s head of
commodity markets strategy in  London . “We are seeing some
technical correction after strong gains yesterday.”  Egyptian Unrest  Oil’s advance was limited as the dollar fell to a two-week
low against its major rivals and U.S. stocks surged after
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  called for maintaining
monetary stimulus.  The Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against six
other major currencies including the euro, tumbled as much as
1.9 percent to 82.418, the lowest level since June 25. A weaker
dollar increases oil’s appeal as an investment alternative.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose as much as 1.4 percent
to 1,675.08, the most since May 22.  WTI surged above $100 a barrel on July 3 for the first time
since September as protests in Egypt heightened concern that
unrest in the most populous Arab country will spread and disrupt
Middle Eastern oil supplies. Shipping traffic through the  Suez
Canal  is continuing normally today, with 43 vessels transiting
the waterway, according to the Suez Canal Authority.  Suez Canal  The majority of crude oil transiting the Suez Canal travels
northbound toward markets in the Mediterranean and  North
America . A combined 2.24 million barrels a day of oil were
shipped from the  Red Sea  to Europe and North America in 2011 via
the Suez Canal and the Suez-Mediterranean, EIA data show.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
September was 22.3 percent, compared with 23.9 percent
yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 859,378
contracts as of 3:38 p.m. It totaled 1.18 million contracts
yesterday, the most since Nov. 16, 2011, and 79 percent above
the three-month average. Open interest was 1.83 million
contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
