Treasury 10-year notes rose for a
fourth day, the longest rally since February, after Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  called for maintaining stimulus
amid division among policy makers on when to slow bond buying.  Treasury notes remained higher after the U.S. sold $13
billion in 30-year bonds at  the highest yield in almost two
years. Benchmark  10-year yields  approached the biggest weekly
drop in more than a year after Bernanke said yesterday “highly
accommodative monetary policy” was needed for the foreseeable
future to support the economy. The yield climbed to the highest
level since August 2011 earlier this week on speculation the Fed
will scale back purchases.  “You had more evidence from the Fed that they are going to
great lengths to make the market realize that they are very data
dependent and are not talking about tightening,” said  David Coard , head of fixed-income trading in New York at Williams
Capital Group LP, a brokerage for institutional investors. The
Fed “won’t do anything that will jeopardize a recovery that’s
still somewhat fragile.”  Benchmark  10-year note yields  fell five basis points, or
0.05 percentage points, to 2.57 percent at 5 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 1.75
percent note maturing in May 2023 rose 14/32, or $4.38 per
$1,000 face value, to 92 28/32.  The current  30-year bond yield  fell two basis points to
3.63 percent. The yield touched 3.72 percent on July 8, the
highest since August 2011, and has increased from this year’s
low of 2.81 percent on May 1.  Volatility, Volume  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Merrill Lynch
Option Volatility Estimate MOVE Index dropped to 93.54, the
lowest level since June 19. It touched 117.89 on July 5, the
highest since December 2010. The one-year average is 64.  Treasury trading volume at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , rose to $346.7 billion,
the highest since July 5. The 2013 average is $322 billion.  The 10-year note yield will rise to 2.62 percent by year-end, according to the median forecast of 67 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News July 5-10. The figure is up from a median
forecast of 2.33 percent in a June 7-12 survey of 78 economists.  U.S. yields have climbed since June 18, the day before
Bernanke said the central bank may reduce the $85 billion of
Treasuries and mortgages it buys each month and end them in
mid-2014 if the economy performs in line with Fed projections.  ‘Cold Feet’  “The cold feet that a lot of investors have had about
getting back in the long end is continuing,” Tom Simons, an
economist in  New York  at Jefferies LLC, one of the primary
dealers obligated to bid at U.S. debt auctions, said before the
sale. “There’s still some reticence out there.”  The securities sold today drew a yield of 3.66 percent, the
highest since August 2011, compared with a forecast of 3.68
percent in a Bloomberg News survey of seven of the Fed’s 21
primary dealers.  The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities that were offered, was
2.26, the lowest since August 2011, versus an average of 2.59
for the previous 10 sales.  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 40.2 percent of the bonds, matching the
highest since March, and compared with an average of 37.1
percent for the past 10 sales.  Three Sales  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 16.3 percent of
the securities, highest since April, compared with an average of
13.9 percent at the past 10 auctions.  Today’s auction is the final of three sales this week of
coupon-bearing debt totaling $66 billion. The U.S. announced it
will sell $15 billion in 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities on July 18.  A $21 billion 10-year note sale yesterday drew a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.57 and an auction of $32 billion in three-year
notes on July 9 yielded 0.719 percent.  Investors have bid $2.93 for each dollar of the $1.143
trillion in U.S. government notes and bonds sold at auction this
year, according to Treasury data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s
down from the record $3.15 for the $2.153 trillion sold at last
year’s offerings.  Fed Futures  Bernanke’s comments yesterday, in response to a question
after a speech in Cambridge,  Massachusetts , were made just three
hours after the Fed released the minutes of the June 18-19
meeting.  While about half of the 19 participants in the  Federal Open
Market Committee  wanted to halt the $85 billion in monthly bond
purchases by year-end, many said they wanted to see more signs
that employment is improving before they’ll begin slowing the
bond purchases, according to the minutes.  “The Fed had to do something,” said  Michael Franzese ,
senior vice president of fixed-income trading at ED&F Man
Capital Markets in New York. “They didn’t want anything to
upset the applecart of the economic gains they have made.”  The Labor Department on July 5 reported the U.S. added
195,000 jobs last month. A Bloomberg News survey had projected
166,000.  The Fed has kept its target for overnight bank lending in a
range of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008. It has said
it will consider raising the  target  when the  unemployment rate 
falls to 6.5 percent, versus 7.6 percent as of June.  Thirty-day federal funds futures contracts for delivery in
April 2015 yielded 0.52 percent, indicating investors expect the
Fed target to be higher by then. As recently as July 5, the
securities for delivery in February 2015 were indicating an
increase in the Fed target. The contract settles at the average
overnight fed funds rate for the delivery month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
