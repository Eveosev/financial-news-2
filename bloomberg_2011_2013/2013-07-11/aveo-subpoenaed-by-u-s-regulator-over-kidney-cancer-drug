Aveo Pharmaceuticals Inc. (AVEO)  said it
received a subpoena from U.S. regulators for documents on its
experimental kidney cancer drug that was rejected for approval
last month. The shares fell 14 percent in extended trading.  The Securities and Exchange Commission asked for documents
and information concerning tivozanib, including communications
with the Food and Drug Administration, Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Aveo said today in a filing. The company on June 10 said
the FDA wouldn’t approve the drug for advanced kidney cancer
because of inconsistent clinical trial results.  An FDA advisory panel had recommended against the
medicine’s approval in May and Aveo on June 4 said it would cut
about 62 percent of its workforce in a restructuring meant to
save $190 million over the next two years.  “The SEC has informed the company that this inquiry should
not be construed as an indication that any violations of law
have occurred or that the SEC has any negative opinion of any
person, entity or security,” Aveo said in the filing.  Aveo fell to $2.18 at 5:11 p.m.  New York  time after gaining
2 percent to close at $2.54. The shares have declined 69 percent
this year.  Aveo was developing tivozanib in a partnership with Tokyo-based  Astellas Pharma Inc. (4503)  It has abandoned work on the drug in
kidney cancer and will focus on breast and colon cancer, as well
as on the development of earlier-stage compounds, the company
said in June. Aveo said it was cooperating with the SEC’s
request.  To contact the reporter on this story:
