Colombian peso bond yields fell the
most in three years after Finance Minister  Mauricio Cardenas 
said the government will delay a decree that encourages pension
funds to invest more abroad.  Yields on  Colombia ’s benchmark peso bonds due in July 2024
fell 31 basis points, or 0.31 percentage point, to 6.40 percent
at 3:43 p.m. in Bogota, according to the central bank. That is
the biggest drop since May 2010.  Cardenas told reporters in Bogota yesterday that it would
delay for months the decree, which would change the way the
government measures funds’ returns. The announcement of the
decree in April had curbed demand for the peso securities, known
as TES, and had left pension funds on the sidelines amid the
global rout, according to Francisco Chaves, the head analyst at
Corredores Asociados brokerage in Bogota.  “The decree had led to speculation pension funds would
need to sell TES bonds to invest more abroad,” Chaves said in a
phone interview from Bogota. “You see big institutional
investors coming back in after they had remained on the
sidelines in the midst” of the global selloff.  The peso advanced 0.5 percent to 1,910.45 per  U.S. dollar .
It is down 7.5 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
