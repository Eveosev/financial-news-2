A landslide in  China ’s southwestern
Sichuan province killed 18 people while a further 107 are
missing or can’t be reached, the Xinhua News Agency reported.  Compiling accurate information on the missing “has been
difficult” as the area is a popular tourist destination with
heavy movement of people, according to a  statement  posted on the
city government’s website.  The landslide, which occurred yesterday in the village of
Sanxi in Dujiangyan City, is believed to have been triggered by
severe rain that has been falling since Monday evening, Xinhua
said.  Premier  Li Keqiang  ordered officials to prioritize  saving
lives , and the State Council asked local governments to
strengthen monitoring of natural disasters such as floods and
storms, and improve contingency plans, the central government
said in statements on its website today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
