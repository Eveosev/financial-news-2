U.S. corn production is rebounding
the most in two decades as farms recover from last year’s
drought-plagued harvest. Hedge funds are bearish on prices for
the first time since 2010.  Output this year will jump 29 percent to a record 13.95
billion bushels (355.2 million metric tons), the biggest
increase since 1994, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said
today in a report. That will add enough grain to supply the 28-nation European Union and  Japan  for a year and more than double
U.S. inventories before the harvest in 2014. Futures will drop
9.4 percent to $4.75 a bushel in three months, the lowest since
October 2010, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimates.  Farmers planted the most acres since 1936 this season as
some Midwest fields got three times their normal rainfall,
including a record soaking in Iowa, the top growing state. Corn
tumbled 18 percent in the  cash  market from the peak during last
year’s drought, reducing costs for buyers including Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. and  JBS (JBSS3)  SA and helping drive global food
prices lower in six of the past nine months.  “The crop is going to be big,” said Hal Reed, the chief
operating officer at Maumee, Ohio-based Andersons Inc., which
owns terminals in seven states capable of storing 145 million
bushels and produces 350 million gallons of ethanol from corn
annually. “Conditions are looking very good right now. We will
have lots of bushels to merchandise, more bushels to store, and
cheaper corn for ethanol.”  U.S. Harvest  Futures for delivery in December, after the harvest, fell
13 percent this year to $5.24 today on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities
slipped 0.7 percent since the end of December, while the MSCI
All-Country World Index of equities rose 8.6 percent. Treasuries
lost 3.3 percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.  Stockpiles in the U.S. on Sept. 1, 2014, will reach 1.959
billion bushels, up from 729 million a year earlier and higher
than the 1.895 billion bushels estimated by 22 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey before the USDA report.  Hedge funds turned bearish last week for the first time
since April 2010, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data
show. The net-short  position  reached 19,943 futures and options,
the most since February 2009. Speculators were net-long 98,380
contracts as recently as May 28.  “We don’t see demand keeping up with the increase in
supply,” said Chris Gadd, an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. in
 London  who anticipates $4.50 or less before the end of the year.
“Once you build that surplus, you have to sell it, and the only
way to sell it is to sell it cheap.”  Wet Weather  With most of the Midwest harvest still three months away,
yields can still be eroded by extreme weather. Last year’s
drought, the worst since the 1930s, cut U.S. production by 13
percent and drove prices to a record $8.49 on Aug. 10.  Crop planting accelerated in the past month as fields dried
out after unusually wet weather earlier in the season that
curbed sowing to the slowest pace since 1980, USDA data show.
Rainfall in parts of Illinois,  Iowa ,  Nebraska ,  Kansas , Missouri
and South Dakota was less than 50 percent of normal in the 30
days ended July 9, National Weather Service data show.  “We continue to watch dryness and building heat in the
western Corn Belt, which could pressure yields,” said Bennett Meier, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York. Most of the
crop was  seeded  two weeks later than normal, so plants will
pollinate during the hottest, driest part of the year, he said.  Early Frost  There’s also an increased risk that corn won’t mature
before freezing weather arrives, usually beginning by late
September to mid-October, said Fred Gesser, the senior
agricultural meteorologist for Planalytics Inc. in Berwyn,
 Pennsylvania . The chance of an early Midwest cold spell
increased after volcanic eruptions in Russia and  Alaska  during
the past month sent gases and ash into the atmosphere, he said.  “We’re behind normal, so right now I would say my main
concern would be an early frost,” said Dave Pollock, the
manager of Wiota Elevator Inc., which operates grain terminals
in Wiota and Anita, Iowa.  Crop  conditions  improved in each of the past four weeks,
with 68 percent rated good or excellent by July 5, USDA data
show. That’s above the five-year average of 63 percent. A year
earlier, the rating was 40 percent and by September had dropped
to 25 percent.  Fields in Iowa were soaked by 17.67 inches of rain from
March 1 to May 31, the wettest in records going back to 1873,
according to the state climatologist. That improved conditions
for the 97.4 million  acres  the USDA estimates was planted with
corn this year.  Illinois Counties  Yields may average 190 to 200 bushels an acre in the
central  Illinois  counties from 148 in 2012 and the 10-year
average of 182.9 bushels, said Kim Craig, the head grain
merchandiser for Deer Creek, Illinois-based Bell Enterprises
Inc., which owns four storage facilities. The USDA today
forecast a national yield of 156.5 bushels, up 27 percent from a
year earlier.  The record U.S. crop will help boost global  production  12
percent to 959.84 million tons, while consumption expands 7.9
percent to 932.43 million tons, the USDA said. Stockpiles will
jump 22 percent to 150.97 million tons in the year that starts
Oct. 1, the highest since 2001.  After three years of prices above $5, or 63 percent more
than the average over the previous decade, farmers boosted
output in Argentina,  Brazil , Ukraine, Europe and  Canada .  Profit Boost  Ample corn supplies will help boost profit in grain
handling and ethanol production for Decatur, Illinois-based  ADM. (ADM) 
Shares of the company rose 31 percent to $35.90 in New York
trading this year. ADM will report a 12 percent gain in  profit 
to $1.56 billion this year, according to the mean of six analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Lower grain prices will help JBS, the Sao Paulo-based meat
producer whose businesses include the Pilgrim’s Pride Corp.
poultry unit. Feed should cost “much less” in the U.S., Chief
Executive Officer Wesley Mendonca Batista said in a conference
call in May.  The United Nations’ cereal-price index dropped in eight of
the past nine months, declining 10 percent since September.
Global food costs are now 11 percent below the record they
reached in February 2011.  “Markets that go high and stay high too long will endure a
longer trough in prices to reach equilibrium,” said Michael Swanson, a senior agricultural economist in  Minneapolis  for
Wells Fargo & Co., the largest U.S. farm lender. “It’s going to
take a couple of years of $4 to $4.50 corn to knock this market
back to reality.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
