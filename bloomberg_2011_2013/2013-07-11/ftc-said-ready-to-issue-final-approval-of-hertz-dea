The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is
set to announce final approval for  Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ) ’s
$2.3 billion acquisition of Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group Inc.
today, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Final approval of the merger comes seven months after the
agency allowed the transaction to proceed provisionally on the
condition that Hertz sell its Advantage brand and 29 other
counters. The person asked not to be named because the decision
hasn’t yet been made public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
