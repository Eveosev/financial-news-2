The Democratic Republic of Congo,
which has some of the world’s richest metal deposits, has
delayed a ban on the export of copper and cobalt concentrate
until next year, the country’s mines minister said.  The ban, which had been scheduled to start this month, is
supposed to compel mining companies to process metals and
minerals in Congo. Miners had complained that the country
doesn’t generate adequate electricity to process all of its
minerals and had asked for a delay.  “The moratorium is until Dec. 31, 2013,”  Martin Kabwelulu , the mines minister, said in a mobile phone text
message, without providing further details.  Congo was the world’s eighth-largest producer of copper and
the biggest producer of cobalt last year, according to the U.S.
Geological Survey. Power shortages have forced some miners to
install generators or buy electricity from neighboring Zambia to
run processing plants.  Glencore International Plc (GLEN) ,  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold
Inc. (FCX) , and  Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. (ENRC)  were the country’s
largest miners in 2012, responsible for 58 percent of copper
production and 56 percent of cobalt output, according to mines
ministry statistics.  The mines ministry previously banned the export of
concentrated minerals in April 2010. That same month, Katangan
Governor Moise Katumbi allowed for mining companies to continue
exporting concentrated minerals if they paid a $60 per metric
ton tax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
