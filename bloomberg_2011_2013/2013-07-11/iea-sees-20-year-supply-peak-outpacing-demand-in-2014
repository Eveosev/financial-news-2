Oil supply will outstrip an
acceleration in demand growth next year as production outside of
OPEC expands at the fastest pace in 20 years, the  International
Energy Agency  predicted.  World oil consumption will climb by 1.2 million barrels a
day next year, up from 930,000 a day in 2013, the IEA said in
its first monthly report with forecasts for 2014. Supplies from
outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
jump by 1.3 million barrels a day amid booming output in  North
America , shrinking the need for crude from the 12-member
producer group, according to the report.  The assessment should “give bulls some cause for alarm,”
the Paris-based adviser to oil-consuming nations said. “While
demand growth is also forecast to pick up momentum,” this
“will still fall short of forecast non-OPEC supply growth.”  Brent crude  has lost about 2 percent this year, trading
today near $109 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe 
exchange, as economic stagnation in Europe, slowing expansion in
China and threats to recovery in the U.S. constrain fuel
consumption. Dependence on OPEC is dwindling as new drilling
techniques enable the U.S. and  Canada  to unlock reserves from
rock formations deep underground.  Global demand will average 92 million barrels a day in
2014, advancing by 1.2 million barrels a day, or 1.3 percent
from this year, according to the IEA report.  IMF Revision  The agency said that today’s forecast hasn’t yet
incorporated a reduction to 2013 economic growth estimates made
by the  International Monetary Fund  on July 9. The Washington-based IMF trimmed its projection for global growth this year to
3.1 percent, from 3.3 percent.  The agency boosted its estimate for demand in 2013 by
220,000 barrels a day from last month’s report, estimating that
oil use will expand by 930,000 barrels a day, or 1 percent, to
90.77 million a day this year. The revision, the third increase
to the 2013 outlook to be made this year, was driven by
unusually cold weather in the second quarter.  “It’s a balanced outlook for the next year, and growth is
likely to increase,”  Eugen Weinberg , head of commodities
research at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt , said before the IEA
report was released. “The million-dollar question is what is
going on with non-OPEC supply,” said Weinberg, who predicts
that Brent will average $116 a barrel in 2014.  Non-OPEC Supply  Production outside OPEC will expand by 1.3 million barrels
a day to 55.9 million a day in 2014, with almost 1 million
barrels of the increase coming from North America, according to
the report. Growth in  Brazil ,  Kazakhstan  and  South Sudan  will
also help offset declines in other non-OPEC regions.  The expansion means that demand for OPEC’s crude will
decline next year to 29.4 million barrels a day, about 200,000 a
day less than will be required this year, and 1.2 million a day
less than the organization pumped in June. Disruptions in Libya,
Nigeria and  Iraq  cut the group’s production by 370,000 barrels a
day last month.  The IEA’s estimate for this “call on OPEC” in 2014 is
200,000 barrels a day lower than that made by the group in
OPEC’s own monthly market report, published yesterday. OPEC’s
projection for world demand growth next year is also about
200,000 barrels a day less than the agency’s at 1 million
barrels a day. The organization meets next on Dec. 4.  Total inventories  of crude and refined products in
industrialized nations are at a “small deficit” of 12.9
million barrels to their five-year average, even after
increasing by 4.8 million barrels a day in May to 2.68 billion
barrels, according to the report.  -- Editors: Stephen Voss, Stephen Cunningham  To contact the reporter on this story:
