U.S. investors are increasing bets
on structured notes tied to the recovering housing sector, even
as a period of record-low interest rates comes to a close.  Banks sold $301.9 million of securities this year tied to
companies whose business is primarily building or selling homes,
up from $8.34 million during the same period in 2012, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The biggest share, $186.3 million
of notes in six offerings, is linked to the Philadelphia Stock
Exchange Housing Sector Index.  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said on June 19
that the central bank may start reducing its $85 billion in
monthly bond purchases later this year if economic growth meets
policy makers’ forecasts. Since then, the average cost of new
30-year, fixed-rate home loans has  climbed  to 4.61 percent from
4.05 percent, according to Bankrate.com data. The measure
reached 4.64 percent on July 5, the highest level since May
2011.  “Historically, in periods where interest rates increased
and mortgage rates increased, homebuilder stocks
underperformed,” said Jason Benowitz, a money manager at New
York-based Roosevelt Investment Group Inc., which sold its stake
in  Lennar Corp. (LEN)  and D.R. Horton Inc. about a month ago. “We see
no reason why that won’t be the case now.”  Yields on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes soared to 2.74
percent on July 5, the highest since August 2011, before
declining to 2.66 percent July 10.  Rising Prices  Before long-term interest rates jumped,  house prices  were
rising. They gained 12 percent in 20 U.S. cities in April, the
biggest year-over-year gain since March 2006, according to
S&P/Case-Shiller data released this week. Construction spending
climbed 0.5 percent to an $874.9 billion annualized rate in May,
the highest level since October 2008, led by expenditures on
residential projects.  Investors bought $115.6 million of notes tied to
homebuilders Lennar,  Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL) ,  PulteGroup Inc. (PHM) ,  MDC
Holdings Inc. (MDC) ,  KB Home (KBH)  and D.R. Horton, in 55 offerings this
year. During the same period in 2012, banks sold $3.68 million
of securities tied to the companies in two offerings.  On June 27,  Bank of America Corp . issued $46.3 million of
two-year notes tied to the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Housing
Sector Index, the fifth-largest offering last month. The
securities can yield at least 35.09 percent if the benchmark
doesn’t decline with protection against 5 percent of losses,
according to a July 1 prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission.  Call Option  The notes are automatically called after one year, for a 10
percent return, if the index is at or above its initial value.
Bank of America, which valued the securities at 95.3 cents on
the dollar, distributed them for a 2 percent fee.  The housing gauge has risen 4.1 percent this year to 178.5
yesterday.  Susan McCabe, a spokesman for Bank of America, didn’t
return a request for comment on the note.  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
