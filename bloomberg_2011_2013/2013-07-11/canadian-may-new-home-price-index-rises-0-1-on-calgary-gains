Canada’s new home  price index  rose
in May led by Calgary and cities in Ontario, the government
statistics agency said.  The 0.1 percent national gain was led by a 0.9 percent
increase in Calgary,  Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa.
Prices also rose 0.6 percent in the Ontario cities of St.
Catharines-Niagara, Sudbury and Thunder Bay.  Economists predicted the index would rise 0.2 percent on
the month, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
 survey  with nine responses. From a year earlier, new  home prices 
increased 1.8 percent in May.  Other reports this week have shown housing-market strength
as officials warn consumers not to become overextended with
mortgage debt. Building permits rose a fifth month in May while
housing starts fell less than economists predicted in June.  Today’s data showed prices in Toronto, the nation’s largest
city by population, increased 0.2 percent. Montreal, the second-largest, saw house prices climb 0.3 percent while those in
Vancouver, the third-largest, fell 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
