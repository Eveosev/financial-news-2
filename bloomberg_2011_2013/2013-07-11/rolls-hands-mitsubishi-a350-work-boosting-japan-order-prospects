Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (RR/) , the sole
provider of engines for  Airbus (EAD)  SAS’s new A350 jet, recruited
 Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. (7011)  to help build an upgraded
power-plant for a model chasing its first orders in  Japan .  Mitsubishi will be a risk and revenue sharing partner on
the Trent XWB-97 that’s being devised for the largest A350
model, manufacturing turbine blades and developing other
components, the Tokyo-based company said in a statement today.  Airbus is seeking Japanese orders for the A350, which first
flew last month, in a market where  Boeing Co. (BA)  is dominant. ANA
Holdings Inc. and Japan Airlines Co. have ordered the Boeing 787
that competes with smaller variants of the European jet, and
Mitsubishi Heavy is also a component supplier to the U.S. plane.  The A350-1000, which takes on the Boeing 777-300ER, has 145
firm orders and is due for delivery from 2017. Rolls said last
month that tests will begin soon to show it can boost the XWB’s
thrust from 84,000 pounds to the required 97,000 pounds.  Mitsubishi will also gain additional work on the Trent 1000
turbine that powers the 787 Dreamliner. The Japanese company
will be involved in developing the Trent 1000-TEN, an upgraded
turbine aimed at powering all Dreamliners, including the 787-10,
the largest version of which Boeing began selling last month.  Rolls plans to have the first development version of the
76,000 pound-thrust engine ready for testing this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
