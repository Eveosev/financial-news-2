The U.K. received applications to
build more than 18 gigawatts of  power plants  under a temporary
program in place until Parliament passes a new energy law,
Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Ed Davey said.  A total of 57 applications for so-called investment
contracts were submitted before the July 1 cutoff date, Davey
told lawmakers in the House of Commons today, suggesting not all
of the applications will be approved.  He was responding to concerns that the risk of power
failures is rising in the U.K. as old generation plants retire.
 Caroline Flint , the opposition  Labour Party  lawmaker who shadows
Davey, raised the matter during the minister’s monthly question
session in Parliament today.  The energy regulator Ofgem said on June 27 that the
probability of major power shortages will increase to about once
in 12 years in 2015 from once in 47 years now.  “Our record has seen energy investment doubling,” from
the previous administration, Davey said, citing average annual
investment in energy infrastructure of 8.5 billion pounds ($13
billion) from 2010 through 2012. “Our electricity market reform
and other measures are designed to continue this investment
surge and sustain it.”  The power plant proposals announced by Davey are under the
government’s Final Investment Decision Enabling program, which
is designed to ensure utilities can advance plans for new
generation capacity before the government passes electricity
market reform measures that are being debated in Parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
