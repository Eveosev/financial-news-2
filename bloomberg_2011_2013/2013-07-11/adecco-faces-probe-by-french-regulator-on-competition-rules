Adecco SA (ADEN)  and  Randstad Holding NV (RAND) 
said they’re among temporary-staffing companies that are being
probed by French regulators in an investigation into whether
they infringed competition rules.  Adecco is “fully cooperating” with the antitrust
regulator, the Glattbrugg Switzerland-based company said in a
statement today. Randstad, based in Diemen, Netherlands, also
said it’s cooperating and that it has confidence in a positive
outcome.  The Swiss company generated 25 percent of its  sales  from
the French market last year. That compares to 18 percent for
Randstad. The companies, the world’s two biggest providers of
temporary workers, didn’t name which other competitors are being
investigated.  To contact the reporters on this story:
