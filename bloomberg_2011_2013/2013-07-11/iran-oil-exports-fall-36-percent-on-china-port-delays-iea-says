Iran exported 36 percent less crude
last month than it did in May because of blockages at ports in
 China , the Islamic republic’s biggest customer, the
 International Energy Agency  said.  Imports of Iranian crude reported by consumers fell to
800,000 barrels a day in June from 1.25 million in May, the IEA
said in its monthly oil report today. China received 390,000
barrels a day last month, from 550,000 in May, as port
congestion there delayed June deliveries of Iran’s oil, the
Paris-based agency said. That reversed an increase in May that
the IEA last month said was due to smoother shipping operations
that allowed China to take in supplies delayed from April.  Japan cut Iranian crude imports by more the half to less
than 100,000 barrels a day, the IEA said. The decline from
240,000 barrels in May was “reportedly due to a delay in
negotiations over contract volumes,” the IEA said.  The U.S. and its allies are restricting  Iran ’s oil exports,
the country’s largest revenue source, and targeting its
financial industry. On July 1, the U.S. implemented a new round
of sanctions aimed at Iran’s shipping and automobile industries,
gold sales and financial institutions doing business in the
rial, the IEA said.  Iranian crude output rose by 20,000 barrels a day in June
to 2.7 million barrels, the IEA said. This is the second
consecutive gain in Iran’s monthly output, according to data in
the four most recent IEA reports. The country added 50,000
barrels a day of output in May and June, nearing the 2.72
million barrel daily production level reached in February, the
reports show.  The IEA today revised down its estimate of Iranian crude
exports for May from the 1.39 million barrels a day the agency
reported in its last monthly report. Estimates of shipments are
based on import data submitted by nations in the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development, information from
customs agencies, news reports and tanker-tracking data, the IEA
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
