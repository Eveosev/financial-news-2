Singapore â€™s stockpiles of middle
distillates rose from the lowest level in almost 19 months,
according to data from a unit of the Ministry of Trade and
Industry.  Onshore inventories of  middle distillates , a category that
includes gasoil and kerosene, increased by 6.2 percent to 8.3
million barrels in the week ended yesterday,  International
Enterprise Singapore  said today in an e-mailed statement.
Supplies were at 7.8 million in the prior period, the lowest
level since Dec. 14, 2011.  Stockpiles of  residues  such as  fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy
residue fell 0.7 percent to 19.8 million barrels. This category
excludes bitumen.  Light distillates  including naphtha, reformate and gasoline
declined 7.6 percent to 8.5 million barrels.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, IE Singapore said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
