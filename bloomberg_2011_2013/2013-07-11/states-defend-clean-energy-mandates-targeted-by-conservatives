State legislatures from  North
Carolina  to Kansas rejected efforts to repeal or reduce
renewable-energy mandates sought by conservative groups funded
by  oil companies  and utilities.  None of the 26 bills to roll back requirements passed
before most state legislature sessions ended, according to a
July 9  report  from Colorado State University’s Center for the
New Energy Economy. Eight states voted to strengthen or modify
laws that require utilities to purchase electricity produced
from renewable sources.  Challenges to so-called renewable portfolio standards in
effect in 30 states have increased since the lobby group
American Legislative Exchange Council released model legislation
in October that state lawmakers are using as a blueprint to try
to water down rules supporting wind and solar energy.  “There was a big push to slow down progress after Alec got
involved but the momentum is in renewable energy’s favor,” Adam Browning, executive director of the San Francisco-based Vote
Solar Initiative, said today in an interview. “Poll after poll
shows that Americans want clean, renewable energy and support
these policies.”  Alec has received backing from oil companies including
Exxon Mobil Corp. and utilities including  Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) 
according to the Center for Media and Democracy.  Rollbacks failed this year in Kansas, Missouri, Ohio, North
Carolina, Texas,  West Virginia  and Wisconsin. States that
amended or increased renewable energy requirements include
Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland and Minnesota.  To contact the reporter on this story:
