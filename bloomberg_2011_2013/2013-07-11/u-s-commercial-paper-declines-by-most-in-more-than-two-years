The market for corporate borrowing
through  short-term IOUs  plunged by the most in more than two
years, reaching the lowest level since November.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper
decreased $45.2 billion, the biggest drop since November 2010,
to $990.5 billion outstanding in the week ended yesterday, the
Federal Reserve said on its website. That’s the lowest level
since the period ended Nov. 14.  Commercial paper sold by  financial institutions  dropped
$27.7 billion to $491.8 billion, also the least since Nov. 14.
IOUs issued by  non-financial companies  fell $15 billion to
$214.9 billion.  The figures may have been depressed as investors waited for
the U.S. employment report released July 5 to gauge the course
of short-term bond yields, Howard Simons, strategist at Bianco
Research LLC in  Chicago , wrote in an e-mail. Also, there may
have been a combined effect from the quarter’s end and the
Independence Day holiday, he wrote.  Corporations sell commercial paper, typically maturing in
270 days or less, to fund everyday activities such as payroll
and rent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
