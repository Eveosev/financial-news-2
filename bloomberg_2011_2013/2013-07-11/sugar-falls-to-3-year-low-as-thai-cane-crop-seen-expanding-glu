Raw-sugar futures fell to a three-year low after  Thailand , the world’s largest exporter after
Brazil, said it will produce a record crop this year.  The cane harvest will jump to 105 million metric tons in
the year that starts in November, the most ever, helping to
boost sugar output by 10 percent to a record 11 million tons,
with about 70 percent set for export, the Bangkok-based Thai
Sugar Millers Corp. said today. In May, the International Sugar
Organization predicted global output would exceed demand by 20
million tons in the 12 months ending Sept. 30.  “The fact that there’s more coming from Thailand just adds
to the supply” surplus, Jack Scoville, a vice president at
Price Futures Group Inc. in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview. “It’s not bullish at all and there’s nothing
positive about the sugar market right now.”  Raw sugar for October delivery dropped 0.7 percent to 16.13
cents a pound at 10:43 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York,
after touching 16.08 cents, the lowest for a most-active
contract since July 1, 2010. The sweetener was down 17 percent
this year through yesterday, heading for a third straight
decline and the longest slump since 1992.  Sugar’s 30 percent drop in the past 12 months is the third
largest among 24 commodities tracked by the Standard & Poor’s
GSCI Spot Index, after coffee and corn. Prices that rose to a
30-year high of 36.08 cents in 2011 spurred farmers from  Brazil 
to  China  to boost planting, leading to a global surplus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
