Saudi Arabia ’s bank index fell the
most in almost a month as second-quarter profit at the kingdom’s
largest lender missed analysts’ estimates.  The Tadawul All Share Bank Index dropped 1.1 percent, the
most since June 15 on a closing basis, to 16,804.81 at 1:12 p.m.
in  Riyadh .  Al Rajhi  Bank, which has the biggest weighting on the
broader measure, retreated 2 percent, also the most since June
15. The benchmark Tadawul All Share Index declined 0.5 percent.  Al Rajhi’s second-quarter  profit  was 2.12 billion riyals
($570 million), missing the average estimate of 10 analysts for
a profit of 2.16 billion riyals, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The bank’s shares have advanced 3.1 percent in the
past year, lagging a rally of 15 percent for the Tadawul and a
gain of 12 percent for  Samba Financial Group. (SAMBA)   The quarterly result is “a negative read as core operation
performance deteriorates and as the bank’s balance sheet growth
uncharacteristically lags the sector’s,”  Jaap Meijer , director
of equity research at Dubai-based Arqaam Capital Ltd., said in
an e-mailed note to clients. “Asset quality appears to be
improving, but we are skeptical about Al Rajhi’s ability to
sustain such low loan-loss charges.”  Arqaam Capital, which has a  hold rating  on the stock,
estimated Al Rajhi’s loan-loss provision charge was 78 basis
points of net loans, compared with 107 basis points in the first
quarter and 96 basis points in the second quarter of 2012. The
bank didn’t provide full financial results yesterday.  Samba, the second-biggest member of the Saudi bank index
after Al Rajhi, fell 2 percent to 50 riyals, the lowest intraday
level since July 3. The lender  posted  a 1.5 percent increase in
second-quarter profit, meeting analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
