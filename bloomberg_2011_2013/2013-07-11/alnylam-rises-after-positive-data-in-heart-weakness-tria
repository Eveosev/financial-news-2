Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ALNY) , a
biotechnology company developing a treatment for rare diseases,
rose to its highest price ever after reporting positive results
in an early trial of its drug.  Alnylam, based in Cambridge,  Massachusetts ,  rose 16 percent 
to $43.53 at the close in New York, its biggest one-day increase
since July 2012. It was the highest price since the company’s
May 2004 initial public offering.  A subcutaneous injection of Alnylam’s experimental therapy
ALN-TTRsc cut 80 percent of a protein called TTR in healthy
volunteers, the company said today in a statement. In some
people, TTR proteins can damage organs and nerves, causing
degenerative disease.  “These data validate Alnylam’s platform technology,” said
Alethia Young, an analyst with Deutsche Bank AG, said today in a
note to clients. “We think 80 percent knockdown is an efficacy
home-run, though our checks have suggested that 50 percent
knockdown may be enough also.”  Alnylam said it plans later this year to take the drug into
the second of three phases of testing usually required for
regulatory approval. Alnylam said a Phase III trial could begin
in 2014. It will be tested in patients with familial amyloidotic
cardiomyopathy, a degenerative heart disease affecting at least
40,000 people worldwide in which the walls of the organ thicken,
weakening its ability to pump blood.  Paris-based  Sanofi (SAN) ’s Genzyme unit is a partner with Alnylam
to develop and market the drug in some parts of the world.  To contact the reporter on this story:
