Petroleos Mexicanos , the state-owned
oil producer, sold $3 billion of dollar bonds today in the first
international debt offering from the country in three weeks.  Pemex, as the company is known, issued $1 billion of bonds
due in five years to yield 220 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries and $1 billion of 10.5-year notes to yield
235 basis points above U.S. debt, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It also sold $500 million more of its notes due in
2041 to yield 290 basis points more than Treasuries and $500
million of five-year floating-rate notes to yield 202 basis
points more than the three-month London interbank offered rate.  The company is raising funds as signs the  Federal Reserve 
will scale back its stimulus program are driving up yields.
Emerging-market issuers sold $50.5 billion of debt last month,
the least since September 2011, as average yields on emerging-market corporate debt climbed to 6.31 percent on June 24, the
highest since November 2011.  Yields on $2.1 billion of Pemex bonds due 2023 have climbed
1.51 percentage points since Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
May 22 the U.S. central bank could pare stimulus measures if the
employment outlook improved substantially.  To contact the reporters on this story:
