Spot electricity gained in  Texas  as
hotter-than-normal weather spurred demand to run air
conditioners.  The high temperature in  Dallas  may be 102 degrees
Fahrenheit (39 Celsius), 6 above the usual reading, and Houston
may be 4 above normal at 96 degrees, AccuWeather Inc. in State
College, Pennsylvania, said on its website.  Power use  on the grid operated by the Electric Reliability

deliveries to Dallas, rose $3.43, or 8.7 percent, to $42.77 a
megawatt-hour in the hour ended at 1 p.m. from the same time
yesterday, grid data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Prices fell across the five other grids stretching from
 Maine  to  California  amid moderate heat.  PJM Interconnection LLC, which manages the 13-state grid
from New Jersey into North Carolina and  Illinois , cut its peak-demand outlook for today to 123,948 megawatts during the hour

yesterday afternoon.  Prices at PJM’s benchmark Western hub, which includes
Washington, dropped $17.44, or 22 percent, to $60.44 a megawatt
hour during the hour ended at 2 p.m.  Northeast Grids  Demand on the two Northeast grid fell below yesterday’s
forecasts, sending prices lower. Deliveries to  Manhattan  slid
$66.85, or 66 percent, to $32.11 a megawatt-hour, while Boston
dropped $25.87, or 34 percent, to $50.34.  The premium of New York to  Boston  for on-peak power,
