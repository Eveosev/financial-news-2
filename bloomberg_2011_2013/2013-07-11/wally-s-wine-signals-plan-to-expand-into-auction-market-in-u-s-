Wally’s Wine & Spirits, a 45-year-old Los Angeles wine store which changed ownership last month,
has signaled plans to set up a New York-based auction business.  The move comes after Maurice Marciano, owner of a boutique
winery in Napa Valley,  California , and his brother Paul, co-founders of apparel brand  Guess? Inc. (GES) , bought Wally’s Wine with
partner Christian Navarro last month from founder Steve Wallace.  The expansion plan is being developed as traditional
auction houses have built up retail and online businesses,
increasing competition. Christie’s started Internet auctions in
the U.S. last year while  Sotheby’s (BID)  now has a wine retail arm.  “We’re going to fill the pipeline with only the best
product,” Navarro, president of Wally’s, said by phone. “It
does involve investment in infrastructure.”  The move by Wally’s will challenge established auctioneers
in the U.S., including Acker Merrall & Condit Company Inc.,
Christie’s International Plc, Sotheby’s, Zachys and Chicago-based Hart Davis Hart Wine Co.  Wally’s  is hiring Michael Jessen, formerly head of Zachys
auction division, as president and chief executive officer of
Wally’s Auctions, according to an e-mailed statement. It’s also
bringing in Julia Gilbert, auction director of White Plains, New
York-based Zachys, as managing director for auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Guy Collins in London at
