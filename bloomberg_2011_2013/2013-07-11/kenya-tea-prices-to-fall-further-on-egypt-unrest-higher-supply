Prices of tea from  Kenya , the
world’s largest exporter of the black variety, will probably
fall further as unrest in  Egypt , the top importer, curbs demand
and because of improved supply, a senior industry official said.  “The prices are expected to remain depressed due to the
unrest in Egypt, which buys a fifth of our tea,” Peter Kimanga,
chairman of the East African Tea Traders Association, said by
phone today from  Mombasa , where weekly tea auctions take place.
“It comes at a time when we have experienced improved crop
production due to the long rain season.”  Tea consumption has also fallen in some importing nations
such as Pakistan and  Afghanistan  because in the summer months
people often drink fewer hot beverages, Kimanga said.  The average price for Kenyan tea fell 4.4 percent to $2.41
per kilogram (2.2 pounds) at an auction this week from the
previous sale the week before, while the volume of sales
declined to 4.5 million kilograms from 5.3 million kilograms,
Tea Brokers East Africa Ltd. said on July 9.  Kenya, East Africa biggest economy, expects to produce 410
million kilograms of tea in 2013, the highest amount in at least
a decade, Kimanga said in April. Tea is Kenya’s biggest earner
of foreign exchange, generating $1.2 billion last year,
according to the central bank.  Shipments to Egypt accounted for about one-fifth of exports
in the first five months of this year, according to data from
Tea Brokers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
