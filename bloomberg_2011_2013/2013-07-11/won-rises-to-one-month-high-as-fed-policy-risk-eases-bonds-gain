The won jumped the most in more than
18 months and government bonds rallied after Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the U.S. economy still requires
stimulus, and South  Korea  kept interest rates steady.  The won led a 0.3 percent advance in the Bloomberg-JPMorgan
Asian Dollar Index that tracks 10 currencies in the region as
the greenback weakened after Bernanke backed sustained stimulus
even as a record of policy makers’ June meeting showed them
debating whether to halt bond buying by the Fed this year. The
Bank of Korea held its benchmark rate at 2.50 percent at a
monetary policy meeting today, a decision predicted by all 18
analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  “Bernanke’s comments assured the market that the Fed’s
tapering may not happen earlier than investors expected, and
that lifted the won,” said Jeon Seung Ji, an analyst at Samsung
Futures Inc. in  Seoul . “Exporters are performing relatively
well, which is another reason behind the won’s recent rally.”  The won rose 1.2 percent to close at 1,122.39 per dollar in
Seoul, the biggest gain since December 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 1,122.07, the strongest level
since June 10.  Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s June 18-19
meeting showed many policy makers want to see more signs
employment is picking up before slowing bond purchases that have
fueled demand for emerging-market assets. Bernanke said on June
19 the central bank may phase out the stimulus measures this
year if the economy grows in line with the Fed’s projections.
U.S. jobless rate is at 7.6 percent and it hasn’t been below 7

in a statement today.  The yield on the 2.75 percent government notes due March
