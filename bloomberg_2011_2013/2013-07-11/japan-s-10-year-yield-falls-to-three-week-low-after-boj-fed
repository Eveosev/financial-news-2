Japan ’s government bonds rose,
pushing the benchmark  10-year yield  to a three-week low, as
comments from the nation’s central bank and the  Federal Reserve 
underscored prospects for continued monetary stimulus.  Sovereign bonds rose by the most in almost a month after
the  Bank of Japan  raised its assessment of the economy and stuck
with a pledge to expand the monetary base by as much as 70
trillion yen ($708 billion) per year, in a statement today. The
yen climbed today to its strongest level this month versus the
dollar after Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke yesterday indicated
policy makers will maintain efforts to keep borrowing costs low.  “The yen’s gain after Fed Chairman Bernanke’s speech is
supporting JGBs,” said  Tetsuya Miura , the chief bond strategist
at Tokyo-based Mizuho Securities Co., one of the 24 primary
dealers obliged to bid at Japan’s debt auctions. “The BOJ’s
decision to revise up its economic forecast was expected. The
economic outlook from autumn is the key for JGBs.”  Japan’s 10-year yields declined 3 1/2 basis points to 0.82
percent as of 3:34 p.m. in  Tokyo , according to Japan Bond
Trading Co. The price of the 0.8 percent note due in June 2023
rose 0.32 yen, or 320 yen per 100,000 yen face amount, to 99.816
yen. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. The yield was the
least since June 20.  The 2-year yield fell to 0.125 percent, the lowest since
June 19, while 20-year yields dropped to 1.715 percent, the
least since July 5.  The BOJ today refrained from adding to the unprecedented
monetary stimulus it announced in April. The bank maintained its
April forecast that  prices , excluding the effect of a planned
sales tax increase, will rise 1.9 percent in the year starting
April 2015. It trimmed some forecasts for inflation and economic
growth. The BOJ now sees inflation of 0.6 percent in the current
fiscal year and 1.3 percent in the following 12 months.  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has set a target of 2 percent
inflation, focusing on a gauge that excludes fresh food.  To contact the reporter on this story:
