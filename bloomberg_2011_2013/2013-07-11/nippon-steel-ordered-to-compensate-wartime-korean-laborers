Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp. (5401) 
was ordered yesterday by the Seoul High Court to pay
compensation to Korean workers for forced labor during Japan’s
colonial rule of the peninsula.  The Tokyo-based steelmaker was ordered by the court to pay
100 million won ($88,000) to each of the four workers who filed
for compensation, Nippon Steel spokesman Masato Suzuki said by
telephone today.  The decision is “regrettable,” Suzuki said. Nippon Steel
plans to appeal to  South Korea ’s  Supreme Court , he said.  All issues related to the claims have been settled as part
as part of a 1965 treaty that normalized relations between Japan
and South Korea, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga
said in a regular media briefing yesterday. The government will
discuss with Nippon Steel for an appropriate response, he said.  The ruling was reported yesterday by the Financial Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
