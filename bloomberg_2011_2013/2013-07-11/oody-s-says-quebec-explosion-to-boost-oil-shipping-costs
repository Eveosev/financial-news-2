A rail explosion in  Quebec  will
probably boost rates for shipping crude on trains as regulators
increase scrutiny on operators, adding costs for North Dakota
oil producers, according to Moody’s Investors Service.  The increase in freight rates is “credit negative” for
producers in North Dakota’s Bakken formation, including  Whiting
Petroleum Corp. (WLL) ,  Continental Resources Inc. (CLR) ,  Oasis Petroleum
Inc. (OAS)  and  Kodiak Oil & Gas Corp. (KOG) , David Berge and Andrew Brooks,
analysts at Moody’s in New York, said in a note today. About
two-thirds of North Dakota’s oil production, more than 727,000
barrels a day in April, is delivered by rail, the analysts said.  A runaway train carrying 72 cars of crude jumped the tracks
and exploded in Lac-Megantic, Quebec, on July 6, killing as many
as 50 people. The train was operated by Montreal, Maine &
Atlantic Railway Ltd., a unit of closely-held Rail World Inc.,
based in  Chicago .  To contact the reporter on this story:
