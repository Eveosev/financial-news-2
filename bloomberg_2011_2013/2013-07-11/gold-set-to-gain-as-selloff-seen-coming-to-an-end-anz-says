Gold may gain next year and in 2015
as central banks boost holdings and investors look to diversify
assets amid global uncertainty, said Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd.  Bullion may reach $1,300 an ounce by year-end, gaining to
$1,400 next year and $1,500 in 2015, analysts led by chief
economist Warren Hogan said in an e-mailed report today. While
there remains further downside for prices in the near-term, the
current selloff is approaching an end, they said.  The call contrasts with forecasts for declines from other
banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which said prices will
reach $1,050 by the end of 2014. Credit Suisse Group AG predicts
$1,150 in about 12 months and Danske Bank A/S sees $1,000 in
three months. Bullion slumped 23 percent this year as some
investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value and  assets 
in gold-backed exchange-traded products tumbled after the
Federal Reserve said in June it may reduce asset purchases.  “We expect the pace of liquidation of gold positions to
abate or even reverse over the year ahead,” the report said.
“Emerging market central banks will remain accumulators of gold
over the medium to long term.”  Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the largest ETP backed by
gold, extended a decline to 939.07 metric tons yesterday, the
lowest since February 2009, data on the trust’s website showed.
At the peak in December, assets in gold ETPs were the world’s
third-largest hoard when compared with national reserves.  Gold for immediate delivery climbed as much as 3.1 percent
to $1,298.73 an ounce today, the highest since June 24, after
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said yesterday the
world’s biggest economy will continue to need stimulus. The Fed
is buying $85 billion of Treasuries and mortgage debt each month
in the third round of its quantitative-easing stimulus program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
