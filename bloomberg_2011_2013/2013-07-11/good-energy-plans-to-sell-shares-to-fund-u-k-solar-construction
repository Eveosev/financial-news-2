Good Energy Group Plc (GOOD) , a British
renewable-power supplier, plans to raise 3.8 million pounds
($5.8 million) by selling shares to pay for the construction of
10 megawatts of solar park developments in the country.  The company will sell about 3.1 million shares at 125 pence
each, Chippenham-based Good Energy said today in a  statement .
Power generated will be enough to supply about 2,300 homes.  Good Energy plans to install as much as 110 megawatts of
solar and wind power by 2016 as the U.K. seeks to get 15 percent
of its energy from renewable sources by 2020. Suppliers of sun
and wind power currently receive premium payments for their
electricity under the nationâ€™s Renewable Obligation program.  Good Energy has spoken to potential lenders including Co-operative Bank Plc over raising debt after it gets consent for
the projects and, assuming it wins approval for all of the
projects, it will seek to sell some, according to the statement.  A solar project costs about 1 million pounds a megawatt,
Good Energy said, with returns of about 9 percent to 12 percent.  Each project takes about 11 months from site selection
through construction, compared with 44 months for wind, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
