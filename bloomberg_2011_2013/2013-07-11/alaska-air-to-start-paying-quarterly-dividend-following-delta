Alaska Air Group Inc. (ALK)  will begin
paying a quarterly dividend of 20 cents a share, joining larger
competitor and partner  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  as U.S. carriers
return cash to stockholders.  The initial payout will be Aug. 22 to shareholders of
record as of Aug. 6, the Seattle-based carrier said today in a
statement.  Alaska Air, the seventh-largest U.S. carrier, is adding the
dividend to supplement its multiyear stock buyback program,
Chief Executive Officer Brad Tilden said in the statement.
Alaska Air is the second U.S. carrier to add a dividend this
year, after Delta said in May it would add pay 6 cents a share
starting Sept. 10 as part of a decade-long turnaround.  “Alaska’s strong financial results over the past several
years have allowed us to pay meaningful bonuses to our
employees, profitably reinvest in our business and grow our
network while significantly reducing debt, keeping our pensions
well-funded and returning capital to our owners,” Tilden said.  Alaska Air began a $250 million stock repurchase last year,
to be completed by the end of 2014. The company said it has
bought back more than $370 million of its shares since 2006.  Shares of Alaska Air rose 3.5 percent to $59.56 at the
close in New York. They have gained 38 percent this year, as the
Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index advanced 40 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
