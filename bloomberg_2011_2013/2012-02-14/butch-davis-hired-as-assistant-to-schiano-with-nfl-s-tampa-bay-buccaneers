Butch Davis was hired as a special
assistant to Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach  Greg Schiano  less than a
year after being fired as football coach at the  University of
North Carolina  during an investigation into rules violations.  Davis, who has experience at the college and professional
level, will be a special assistant to the head coach, the
National Football League team said on its website.  Schiano left  Rutgers University  three weeks ago to take his
first NFL head coaching position. He was defensive coordinator
under Davis at the  University of Miami  in 1999 and 2000  Davis, 60, coached the Hurricanes from 1995 to 2000, the
NFL’s  Cleveland Browns  from 2001 to 2004 and UNC from 2007 to
2010. He was fired by the Tar Heels in July, one month after the
school was accused by the  National Collegiate Athletic
Association  of nine rules infractions, including unethical
conduct between one of Davis’s assistants and a former NFL
agent.  In 30 years as a coach and assistant, he has helped teams
to two Super Bowl victories, one NCAA title, five NFL playoff
appearances and 14 college bowl games, according to the website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
