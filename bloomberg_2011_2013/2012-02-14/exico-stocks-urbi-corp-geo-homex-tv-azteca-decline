The following companies had unusual
price changes in  Mexico  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close of trading.  The IPC  index  fell 1 percent to 37,831.87.  Urbi Desarrollos Urbanos SAB (URBI*)  , Mexico’s third
largest homebuilder by sales, dropped 19.2 percent to 16.88, the
largest decline on a closing basis since October 2008. Urbi’s
free cash flow to equity last year trailed the company’s
projections, according to preliminary results reported
yesterday.  Urbi’s “disappointing” results are an “unfavorable read-
across” for the homebuilding sector, Credit Suisse Group AG
analysts led by Vanessa Quiroga wrote in a research note today.  Desarrolladora Homex SAB (HOMEX*)  , Mexico’s largest
homebuilder, fell 9.3 percent to 42.93 pesos.  Corp. Geo SAB (GEOB) 
, the second largest, decreased 14.4 percent to 18.99
pesos.  TV Azteca SAB (AZTECACP)  (AZTECACP MM), Mexico’s second-largest
broadcast television network, fell 1.6 percent to 8.71 pesos. TV
Azteca’s networks are being dropped by Mexican cable-TV carriers
representing more than 4 million subscribers in a dispute over
terms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
