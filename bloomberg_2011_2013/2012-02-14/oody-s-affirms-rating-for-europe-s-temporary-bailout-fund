Moody’s Investors Service affirmed
its top  credit rating  for  Europe ’s temporary bailout, citing the
creditworthiness of the fund’s biggest contributors even after
the company issued a series of downgrades.  The European Financial Stability Facility kept its Aaa
rating along with a stable outlook, Moody’s said in a statement
early today. The EFSF outlook rests on the creditworthiness of
Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Luxembourg after
downgrades in Spain, Italy and four others, Moody’s said.  “Although the recent actions on the ratings of some of the
EFSF’s guarantors weaken the quality of the facility’s guarantor
pool,” Moody’s said its decision “is driven by the fact that
no Aaa-rated country has lost its top-notch rating.”  The move contrasts with  Standard & Poor’s  downgrade of the
EFSF last month after the credit company revoked the AAA-rating
of  France  and Austria. EFSF Chief Executive Officer Klaus Regling said at the time that S&P’s downgrade wouldn’t affect
the fund’s 440 billion-euro ($580 billion) lending capacity.  Moody’s cut the debt ratings of six European countries and
said it may strip France and the U.K. of their top ratings,
citing the debt crisis. Spain was downgraded to A3 from A1,
Italy to A3 from A2 and Portugal to Ba3 from Ba2. Slovakia,
Slovenia and Malta also had their ratings lowered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
