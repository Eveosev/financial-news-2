Rio Bravo Investimentos , the
Brazilian  investment company , plans to double the size of its
renewable energy fund to 600 million reais ($348 million) next
month to meet growing interest in wind farms from pension funds.  More than 90 percent of the backing in a current
fundraising round for the company’s Rio Bravo Fip de Energia I
fund will come from national pension funds, Sergio Guimaraes de
Mello Brandao, who helps manage the fund, said in an interview
today at a conference in  Sao Paulo .  Brazil’s government-organized auctions for electricity
contracts give wind farms a steady source of revenue, making the
projects less risky and more appealing to pension funds, Brandao
said.  “The regulatory framework is safer here than in the EU,”
Brandao said.  Brazil ’s long-term contracts “offer all the
security that’s necessary.”  The fund will have stakes in wind farms with 570 megawatts
of total capacity by March 2014, he said. It will also be
backing small hydroelectric plants with 160 megawatts of
capacity by the end of 2016, he said.  Annual returns for the fund, which raised 300 million reais
in October, are expected to be about 11 percent, excluding
inflation, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
