Airbus SAS Chief Executive Officer
 Tom Enders  said the European Union’s plans to require
international airlines to pay for their carbon emissions
threatens to create a trade war,  Le Figaro  reported.  The CEO said told a press conference on the eve of today’s
Singapore air show that he’s very worried about the consequences
of EU plan, the French newspaper reported.  China  has hinted the
proposal may hinder their purchase of European planes, and
nations including the U.S., Russia and India have also signalled
their opposition to the planned levy, according to Le Figaro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
