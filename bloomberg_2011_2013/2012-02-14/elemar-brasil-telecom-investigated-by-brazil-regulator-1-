Grupo Oi units  Telemar Norte Leste
SA (TMAR5) , Telemar Internet Ltda,  Brasil Telecom SA (BRTO4)  and BRT Servicos de
Internet SA are being investigated for alleged unfair practices
in their call centers.  The antitrust arm of Brazil’s Justice Ministry, known as
SDE, suspects the telecommunications companies have used their
call centers to promote their own Internet service providers
without mentioning competitors’ products, said Diogo Thomson de
Andrade, director of the Economic Protection and Defense
Department, in a telephone interview from Brasilia.  “This case is very similar to another regarding  Telefonica
SA (TEF) ,” said Andrade.  Rio de Janeiro-based Oi said it treats all the internet
providers equally and will analyze the SDE investigation before
commenting on it, according to an e-mailed statement to
Bloomberg.  Telefonica’s Telecomunicacoes de Sao Paulo SA unit  agreed 
with the Administrative Council for Economic Defense, or Cade,
in November 2010 to allow clients to choose their Internet
service provider online instead of through its call center.  The start of the investigation was reported today in
 Brazil ’s official gazette.  To contact the reporter on this story:
