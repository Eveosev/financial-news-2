Charles River Laboratories
International Inc. (CRL) , the seller of mice and rats used in
laboratory experiments, gained the most in a month after
reporting earnings that beat analyst estimates.  Charles River  climbed  3.9 percent to $35.23 at 4 p.m. in
New York, the biggest increase since Jan. 10. The Wilmington,
Massachusetts-based company reported earnings excluding one-time
items of 69 cents a share, beating by 10 cents the average of 16
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “Charles River is showing that it’s doing a very good job
of managing its business within the constraint of a difficult
industry environment,” said John Sullivan, an analyst at
Leerink Swann & Co. in Boston with a “market perform” rating
on the company. “Charles River is managing its business to
maximize its  cash flow  while continuing to make the investments
that should facilitate growth when growth is available.”  The company is being careful with expenses and is taking
advantage of tax rate opportunities and share repurchases,
Sullivan said.  Charles River sells mice and rats for experiments and also
conducts pre-clinical trials on the animals. It counts Pfizer
Inc. and  Roche Holding AG  as  customers , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
