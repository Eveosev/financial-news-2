CapitaLand Ltd. (CAPL) , Southeast  Asia ’s
biggest developer, said fourth-quarter profit dropped 20 percent
as gains from asset sales declined from a year earlier.  Net income fell to S$476.6 million ($379.2 million) in the
quarter ended Dec. 31, from a revised S$596 million a year
earlier, it said today in a statement to the Singapore stock
exchange. That beat the S$175.47 million average of seven
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue rose 17
percent to S$1.06 billion from a revised S$903 million, compared
to the S$1.23 billion estimated by analysts.  CapitaLand posted higher revenue from projects in
Singapore,  China , Australia and  Vietnam , and increased rental
earnings from its shopping mall business, it said. Portfolio
gains totaled S$83.7 million in the quarter, down 62 percent
from S$219.7 million a year earlier when it sold Raffles City
Changning and 28 serviced residence properties, it said today.  “We will maintain our focus on growing the business in our
core markets,” Liew Mun Leong, president and chief executive
officer of the CapitaLand Group, said in the statement.
“ Singapore  and China, two of our core markets, are in Asia and
we want to be part of its growth story.”  CapitaLand expects its residential business in Singapore to
remain healthy, benefitting from the continued revenue growth
from The Interlace, Urban Resort Condominium and The Wharf
Residence. In 2012, the developer will start expansion work at
The Interlace and d’Leedon and the condominium project in Bishan
Central, it said.  China Malls  CapitaLand remains positive about the  property market  in
China over the long-term as urbanization, strong domestic
consumption and increasing affluence boost demand, Liew said.
The developer plans to open seven new malls in China and two in
Singapore this year, while its serviced apartment brand, the
Ascott, is set to reach its target of 40,000 apartment units by
2015, CapitaLand said.  “According to growth forecasts, other than  India , Asia’s
growth will be fuelled by China’s growing and rapidly urbanizing
economy,” Liew said.  The company’s  shares  were unchanged at S$2.90 at 11:41 a.m.
local time. The stock has gained 31 percent this year, compared
with the 12 percent advance in Singapore’s benchmark Straits
Times Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
