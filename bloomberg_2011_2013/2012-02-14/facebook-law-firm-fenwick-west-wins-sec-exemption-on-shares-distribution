Fenwick & West LLP , the  law firm 
representing  Facebook Inc. (FB)  in its initial public offering, won
an exemption that will reduce reporting requirements for
companies issuing a class of restricted stock to employees,
directors and some consultants.  The exemption, granted by the Securities and Exchange
Commission in a letter yesterday, concerns “restricted stock
units,” representing the right to receive common stock if
“certain conditions” are met before they expire, according to
Fenwick & West’s Feb. 7 request sent to the SEC.  Fenwick & West  Chairman Gordon Davidson said yesterday in
an interview that the SEC’s ruling offers “globally applicable
relief” for companies. The rule means restricted stock unit
plans won’t trigger registration requirements if they are
awarded to more than 500 employees, Davidson said.  Without such exemptions, Davidson said, companies with more
than 500 shareholders would subject to the same regulatory
reporting requirements as publicly traded companies. Fenwick &
West won such an exemption for Facebook in 2008, he said.  “Based on the facts presented,” the SEC’s Division of
Corporation Finance “will not object if a company does not
comply with the registration requirements” based on Fenwick &
West’s explanation of a “written compensatory equity incentive
plan,” according to the SEC’s letter. “Any different facts or
conditions might require the division to reach a different
conclusion.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
