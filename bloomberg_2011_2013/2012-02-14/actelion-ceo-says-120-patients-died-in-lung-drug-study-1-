Actelion Ltd. (ATLN) , the Swiss drugmaker,
said 120 people died in a clinical trial of more than 700
patients involving its experimental medicine macitentan.  The drug is “very unlikely” to show a statistically
significant benefit in extending the lives of patients with
pulmonary arterial hypertension, though the company is confident
the trial will show patients are helped by the product, Chief
Executive Officer Jean-Paul Clozel said on a conference call
today.  “Hopefully if there is an effect on morbidity, we should
also see a trend on mortality,” Clozel said. “No drug in
pulmonary hypertension has ever been able to show any benefit on
morbidity-mortality in a double-blind randomized study.”  Actelion fell 3.4 percent to 34.25 Swiss francs at 3:53
p.m. in Zurich.  To contact the reporter on this story:
