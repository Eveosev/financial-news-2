Cargill Inc., a privately-held
producer and marketer of food and agricultural products and
services, hired seven banks to help arrange a $1 billion
revolving credit facility.  The 364-day facility “enhances Cargill’s flexibility in
meeting its short-term funding needs in the Asian and European
geographies,” Singapore-based Bruce Blakeman, vice president,
corporate affairs, said in an e-mail. “The renewal is part of
our ongoing debt management program. It is led by a consortium
of seven banks and is expected to close in March.”  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) , Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., BNP Paribas SA, Deutsche Bank AG,  HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Standard
Chartered Plc began marketing the loan to other lenders last
week, a person familiar with the matter said today, asking not
to be identified as the details are private.  Proceeds will be used to refinance a $1.25 billion facility
which matures in March, the person said. The new loan pays a
margin of 75 basis points more than the London interbank offered
rate and banks lending $75 million receive a so-called top-level
all-in fee of 100 basis points, the person said.  Those pledging $50 million receive an all-in fee of 95
basis points and those committing $25 million an all-in fee of
92.5 basis points, the person said.  The $1.25 billion loan that funds will be used to refinance
matures on March 24, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That facility pays a margin of 65 basis points over Libor, the
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
