Lansdowne Partners LP, the largest
European hedge fund that invests in stocks, bought stakes in
 Google Inc. (GOOG) ,  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  and Morgan Stanley and sold shares
of International Business Machines Corp. worth $464.5 million.  The hedge fund purchased 760,952 shares of Google in the
fourth quarter valued at $491.5 million and 709,250 shares of
Amazon.com valued at $122.8 million, according to a filing today
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The London-
based firm bought 3.1 million shares of Morgan Stanley valued at
$46.7 million.  Lansdowne, which was founded by Paul Ruddock and Steven Heinz in 1998 and oversees about $14.5 billion, sold its  IBM (IBM) 
stake amid a 25 percent gain in the stock last year. The Armonk,
New York-based firm, the world’s biggest computer-services
provider, has surged 127 percent since 2008 as clients increased
spending on software.  Lansdowne sold an earlier stake of 3 million shares of
 Morgan Stanley (MS)  in the third quarter of last year amid a 50
percent slump for the New York-based bank. Morgan Stanley has
climbed 40 percent since Sept. 30.  Managers who oversee more than $100 million in equities
must file a Form 13F within 45 days of each quarter’s end to
list their U.S.-traded stocks, options and convertible bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
