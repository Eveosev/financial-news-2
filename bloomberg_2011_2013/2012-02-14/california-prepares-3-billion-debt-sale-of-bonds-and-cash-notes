California (STOCA1)  will offer about $2
billion of general-obligation bonds on March 1, the largest sale
in four months by the most indebted U.S. state, a spokesman for
Treasurer Bill Lockyer said.  Proceeds from the sale will be used to refund outstanding
debt,  Tom Dresslar , Lockyer’s spokesman, said yesterday.  J.P.
Morgan (JPM)  Securities LLC, Barclays Capital Inc. and  Wells Fargo &
Co . will manage the bond sale, Lockyer’s office announced last
week.  The state on Feb. 22 will also sell about $1 billion in
short-term revenue-anticipation notes to deal with cash-flow
needs.  The sales come amid the biggest rally for California debt
in two years after Governor  Jerry Brown  and Lockyer curtailed
borrowing to help shrink deficits totaling more than $35 billion
since Brown took office in January 2011. The state borrowed $3.3
billion in 2011, the least in four years, last selling tax-
exempt debt Oct. 17, when it borrowed $1.8 billion.  The tax-anticipation notes will help Lockyer and Controller
John Chiang deal with a $3.3 billion cash shortfall they
estimate through the middle of April. Tax revenue hasn’t met
forecasts and spending has exceeded projected levels, Chiang
said Jan. 31.  California’s debt rating of A- from  Standard & Poor’s , the
fourth-lowest investment grade, is the lowest of any state.
Moody’s Investors Service rates the state A1, the second-lowest
after  Illinois .  Higher Yield  A California general-obligation bond sold in March 2010 and
due in 2022 yielded about 75 basis points more than an index of
AAA rated 10-year securities on Jan. 30, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s down from 170 basis points after
the sale and less than the 109-point two-year average. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  State and local debt of California returned a total of 14.8
percent last year, according to a Bank Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index. That’s more than the 11.2 percent for the full $3.7
trillion municipal market, the 9.8 percent for U.S. Treasuries
and the 7.5 percent for investment-grade company debt.  It was the third straight year the state’s securities beat
all munis since 2008, when they lost 7 percent. Through January,
 California  issues returned 3.3 percent, more than the market,
Treasuries and corporate debt, the Merrill indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
