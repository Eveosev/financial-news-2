Portugal’s economy  shrank for a
fifth quarter in the three months through December as the
government cuts spending and raises taxes to narrow its  budget
deficit .  Gross domestic product dropped 1.3 percent from the third
quarter, when it fell 0.6 percent, the Lisbon-based National
Statistics Institute said in a preliminary report today.
Economists predicted a decline of 1.5 percent, the median of
eight estimates in a Bloomberg survey showed. GDP dropped 2.7
percent from a year earlier.  Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  is facing a recession as
he cuts spending and increases taxes to meet the terms of a 78
billion-euro aid plan from the European Union and the
 International Monetary Fund . As the country’s borrowing costs
surged, Portugal followed Greece and Ireland in April in seeking
a bailout.  To contact the reporter on this story:
