Nykredit A/S,  Europe ’s largest
mortgage-backed covered bond issuer, said it will refinance 109
billion kroner ($19.3 billion) in auctions to be held this month
and next.  Monthly payments for homeowners holding adjustable-rate
loans probably will remain low, Nykredit said in an e-mailed
statement. Payments, including principal, for loans financed by
one-year bullet bonds will be about 3,285 kroner after tax.
That’s 500 kroner lower than the average payment since the loans
were introduced in 1996, the Copenhagen-based lender said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
