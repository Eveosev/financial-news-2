Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) ’s
$699 million settlement with  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  was unopposed
by creditors as it heads for a court hearing tomorrow, according
to a court filing.  Under the agreement today, JPMorgan will pay bankrupt
Lehman the money, which the bank’s investment fund affiliates
had claimed as compensation for losses on Lehman investments.
Lehman and its creditors had said the claims weren’t
“plausible.”  The judge usually approves such uncontested agreements put
before him. The $699 million was part of an $8.6 billion fight
between Lehman and JPMorgan. Lehman has been trying to recover
the funds, consisting of collateral deposited with the bank
about the time of Lehman’s 2008 bankruptcy.  The lawsuit is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 10-03266,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court ,
Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
