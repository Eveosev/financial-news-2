A measure of European banks’
reluctance to lend to one another held at the lowest level in
four months, according to a money-markets indicator.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the euro
interbank offered rate and overnight indexed swaps, was little
changed at 70 basis points at 10:18 a.m. in  London , data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Lenders are more willing to pass cash on to their peers
after the  European Central Bank  injected 489 billion euros ($639
billion) into the financial system under its so-called longer-
term refinancing operation in December. The Frankfurt-based ECB
will hold a second auction of cheap funding later this month.  “The three-year LTROs have been an important addition to
the ECB arsenal,” said  Orlando Green , a fixed-income strategist
at Credit Agricole SA in London.  The three-month cross-currency basis swap, the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was little
changed at 68 basis points below Euribor, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The measure was minus 114 at the start of the
year.  The one-year  basis swap  was 61 basis points less than
Euribor, from minus 59 yesterday. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the ECB for the
third day yesterday, placing 510 billion euros with the
Frankfurt-based central bank, up from 508 billion euros on Feb.
10.  Three-month  Euribor (EUR003M) , the rate banks say they pay for three-
month loans in euros, fell for a 39th day to 1.051 percent, from
1.057 percent. It’s the longest run of declines in 2 1/2 years.
One-week Euribor fell to 0.371 percent from 0.373 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
