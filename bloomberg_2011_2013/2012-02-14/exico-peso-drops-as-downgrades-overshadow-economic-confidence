Mexico ’s peso weakened as investor
concern the European debt crisis will deepen overshadowed an
increase in auto production in the Latin American country.  The peso fell 0.5 percent to 12.7605 per  U.S. dollar  at the
close in Mexico City, from 12.6982 yesterday. It has gained 9.2
percent this year, the most among major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  Moody’s Investors Service yesterday cut the debt ratings of
six European countries including Italy, Spain and Portugal and
said it may strip  France  and the U.K. of their top Aaa ratings,
citing  Europe ’s debt crisis. Mexican  production  of cars and
light trucks reached 202,701 units in January, a 1.2 percent
increase from a year earlier, the nation’s Automobile Industry
Association, known as AMIA, reported today.  While an expansion in auto production has already been
priced into the peso, “markets are again nervous by the
downgrade of  Italy , Spain and Portugal and the negative outlook
given to England, France and Austria,”  Ramon Cordova , a
currency trader at Banco Base SA in Monterrey, Mexico, said by
phone.  Sales at U.S. retailers rose less than forecast in January,
reflecting an unexpected drop in purchases of automobiles. The
0.4 percent gain reported by the Commerce Department today in
 Washington  was half the 0.8 percent median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales excluding cars climbed
0.7 percent, more than projected and the biggest gain since
March.  Mexico sends about 80 percent of its exports to the U.S.  The yield on peso-denominated debt due in 2024 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.43 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price of the
securities rose 0.15 centavo to 131.07 centavos per peso.  Mexico sold all 6 billion pesos of 28-day Cetes and 7
billion pesos of the 91-day securities it offered today, the
central bank said on its website. It also sold all 8.5 billion
pesos in 175-day bills it auctioned today, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
