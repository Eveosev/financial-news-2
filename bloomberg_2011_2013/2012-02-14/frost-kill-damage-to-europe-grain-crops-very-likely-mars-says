Grain crops in parts of northwestern
 Europe  including  France  and Germany probably suffered from
winter kill because of a “severe” cold spell, the European
Union’s crop-monitoring unit reported.  “Frost-kill damage due to the current cold spell is very
likely to occur in eastern France, the Benelux countries,
Germany, Poland and Czech Republic, as well as in Ukraine,” the
EU’s Monitoring Agricultural Resources unit wrote in a  report  on
its website dated Feb. 10 and published yesterday.  Mild weather before the cold spell had partially prevented
winter cereals from hardening, meaning the grains were
vulnerable to freezing temperatures, MARS wrote. Snow cover at
the start of the cold snap was absent or “very thin” in
Western Europe and  Poland , as well as around the  Black Sea ,
according to the EU unit.  Fully hardened winter cereals can tolerate minus 18 degrees
Celsius (-0.4 Fahrenheit), based on changes in plant physiology
induced by falling temperatures that change the freezing point
of cellular liquids, according to MARS.  France is the EU’s largest wheat producer, followed by
Germany.  To contact the reporter on this story:
