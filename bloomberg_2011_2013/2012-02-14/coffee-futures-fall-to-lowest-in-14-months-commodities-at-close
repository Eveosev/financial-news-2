percent to 1,605.29.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Coffee plunged to a 14-month low on mounting concern that

falter.  Sales at U.S. retailers rose 0.4 percent in January, the
Commerce Department said. The median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a gain of 0.8 percent.

$3.7935, the lowest since Feb. 3.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
