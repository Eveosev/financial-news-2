First Bank of Nigeria Plc , the
country’s third-biggest lender by market value, advanced the
most in two months, as investors bet it will pay a “good”
dividend.  The stock jumped the maximum 5 percent permissible under
the country’s stock exchange regulations, the most since Dec.
16, to 10.50 naira by the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos,  Nigeria ’s
commercial capital.  “Very soon the full-year results will be released and
investors believe it will pay a good dividend,” David Adonri,
chief executive officer of Lambeth, said by phone today.  About 28.92 million of First Bank’s shares, or 95.3 percent
of the three-month daily average, traded today, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock is up 18 percent this
year, compared with the 0.3 percent fall in the Nigerian Stock
Exchange All-Share Index. The lender’s net income for the third
quarter through September rose 32 percent to 42.9 billion naira
($270 million), it said Oct. 13.  The  Central Bank  of Nigeria introduced a December common
year-end for lenders in  Africa ’s most populous nation as part of
its reforms in the banking industry. Full-year results for 2011
will start streaming in later this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
