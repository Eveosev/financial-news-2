Taiwan ’s best-performing debt fund
is buying Russian, Romanian and Turkish government bonds as the
 European Central Bank ’s injection of funds into lenders helps
ward off a cash crunch.  Bryan Wang, who manages NT$6.1 billion ($207 million) of
assets as a manager at Fuh Hwa Securities Investment Trust Co.,
said he added the securities to this year. His  Emerging Markets
High-Yield Fixed-Income Fund (FHEMHYA)  returned 7.9 percent in 2012, the
most of 115 debt funds in Taiwan tracked by Bloomberg.  “If you look at the portfolios of major European banks,
they have a lot of exposure in Eastern Europe,” Taipei-based
Wang said in an interview yesterday. “Since the ECB is
injecting funds into European banks, the money will flow into
these countries, driving bond rallies.”  The ECB loaned 523 lenders a record 489 billion euros ($644
billion) for the next three years in December. Turkish and
Russian 10-year bonds yielded 9.64 percent and 8.23 percent,
compared with 8.54 percent for  India ’s 10-year debt, the highest
among  Asia ’s major emerging markets. Wang said he expected
returns on Russian, Romanian and Turkish debt to surpass those
on Asian sovereign bonds this year.  Turkey ’s local-currency debt has gained 3.2 percent in 2012,
while Russian securities rallied 2.9 percent, JPMorgan Chase &
Co. indexes show. Yields on  Romanian (GRRO5YR)  five-year notes dropped 38
basis points, or 0.38 percentage point, to 5.61 percent on Feb.
10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Asian sovereign
bonds have returned 4.5 percent, HSBC Holdings Plc indexes show.  Turkish Rebound  Turkish inflation was 10.6 percent in January and central
bank Governor Erdem Basci forecast this month the rate would
decline to 6.5 percent by year-end.  Ten-year (IECM10Y)  Turkish yields
jumped 135 basis points in 2011 as the lira tumbled 19 percent,
before rebounding 9.1 percent this year.  “The debt got beaten up too much when economic prospects
worsened,” Wang said. “It’s time for a rebound,” he said,
adding it was rare to see yields of more than 9 percent for an
economy of that size.  Greek lawmakers approved budget cuts over the weekend
needed to secure an international bailout. Wang said he expected
policy makers will find a solution to  Europe ’s debt crisis and
rallies in the region’s bonds won’t be temporary.  “I’m fairly optimistic the European Union will end up
finding a solution to its current turmoil,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
