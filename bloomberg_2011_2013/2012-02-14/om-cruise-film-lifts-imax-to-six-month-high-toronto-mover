Imax Corp. (IMX) , the maker of giant-
screen movie-projection systems, rose to a six-month high today
after saying box-office revenue increased 45 percent this year
through Feb. 12 from the same period in 2011.  Imax shares surged  11 percent  to C$24.45 in Toronto after
the Mississauga, Ontario-based company said worldwide receipts
at Imax cinemas totaled $55 million. About half of the sales
came from the Tom Cruise movie “Mission: Impossible - Ghost
Protocol,” which has grossed $70 million at Imax theaters since
its release in December.  Revenue “is well ahead of our expectations, given that we
are forecasting $90 million in box office for the quarter,”
Aravinda Galappatthige, an analyst at Canaccord Financial Corp.,
wrote in a note to clients. “Imax has a very busy film slate in
March comprising of ‘The Lorax,’ ‘John Carter’ and the much-
awaited ‘Hunger Games.’ Given this, we now believe IMAX may even
reach $110 million.”  Imax tumbled 33 percent last year as it missed analysts’
average earnings estimates for the first three quarters amid
concern 3-D movies may be losing popularity. The shares have
rebounded 31 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
