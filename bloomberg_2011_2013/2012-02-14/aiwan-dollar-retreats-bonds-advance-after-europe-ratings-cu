Taiwan’s dollar weakened and
 government bonds  advanced after Moody’s Investors Service cut
the debt ratings of six European nations including Italy and
Spain, damping demand for riskier assets.  Asian stocks declined after the credit assessor also
lowered its outlook on the U.K. and France to negative. Taiwan’s
 exports  slumped 16.8 percent in January from a year earlier,
after rising 0.6 percent the previous month, the government
reported last week.  “ Europe ’s downgrades are hurting risk-taking,” said Eric Hsing, a fixed-income trader at First Securities Inc. in Taipei.
“It’s quite worrying that the austerity measures taken by these
European countries will eventually hurt demand for Asia’s
exports.”  The  Taiwan dollar  dropped 0.2 percent to NT$29.595 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched
NT$29.37 on Feb. 10, the strongest level since Sept. 13.  The yield on the government’s 1.25 percent notes due March
2022, the most-traded  government securities , fell three basis
points to 1.263 percent, prices from Gretai Securities Market
show. The  overnight money-market rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.396 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
