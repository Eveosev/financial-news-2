Russia may cut its annual defense
and security budget by as much as 700 billion rubles ($23.4
billion) to increase spending on health care and education,
 Vedomosti  reported, citing government documents.  The government needs to balance its budget to meet social
obligations, including Pension Fund liabilities, which may
remain in deficit through 2025, the Moscow-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
