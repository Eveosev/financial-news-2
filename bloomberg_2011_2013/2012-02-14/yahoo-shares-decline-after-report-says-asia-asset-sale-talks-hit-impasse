Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) , the largest U.S. Web
portal, tumbled as much as 7.4 percent following a report that
the talks concerning a possible sale of its Asian assets have
hit an impasse.  The discussions stalled partly because of concerns over
whether the terms will be tax-efficient enough, according to the
technology blog AllThingsDigital.  Yahoo (YHOO) , based in Sunnyvale
California, owns stakes in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Yahoo
 Japan .  The stock fell 5.5 percent to $15.24 at 1:49 p.m. New York
time after earlier sinking to $14.92. A collapse of negotiations
may put additional pressure on Yahoo’s board, which recently
endured a shakeup and has conducted a strategic review of the
company since September, following the ouster of Chief Executive
Officer  Carol Bartz .  Yahoo said earlier this month that it weighed proposals for
equity investments without receiving an attractive offer. The
company said it continues to discuss a possible sale of its
holdings in Asia and that it’s devoting “significant resources
to these discussions.”  The Web portal is replacing Chairman Roy Bostock and three
other directors, according to a statement Feb. 7. The
announcement came a month after Yahoo hired  Scott Thompson  as
its new CEO.  Dana Lengkeek, a spokeswoman for Yahoo, didn’t immediately
return a phone message seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
