Austria ’s Finance Minister Maria Fekter said she was confident that Greece will get additional
aid.  “Greece has agreed an ambitious program,” Fekter told
reporters in Vienna today. “The IMF and the commission will
report in how far it sustainably is guaranteed that Greece will
get on its feet again. It will take a long time for Greece, but
I as far as I’ve seen details I am confident that Greece will
get additional assistance.”  “We have very positive signals on a PSI understanding,”
Fekter said, referring to a deal on writedowns for private
bondholder. “I expect this to also be on the table” when
finance ministers meet in Brussels, she said.  “The first aim of the European Union and of the euro zone
has to be not to kick or push  Greece  out of the euro zone, but
on the contrary that both sides endeavor to solve” Greece’s
problems, Chancellor Werner Faymann said today. Raising Greece’s
competitiveness will take “year,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
