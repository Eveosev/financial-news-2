European governments will decide
“soon” on a second Greek aid program, European Union Economic
and Monetary Commissioner Olli Rehn said.  “I expect that we should soon be able to decide on a new
second program for  Greece , also in order to launch an offer on
private sector involvement which is a very important part of
this overall package,” Rehn told reporters in Strasbourg,
 France  today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
