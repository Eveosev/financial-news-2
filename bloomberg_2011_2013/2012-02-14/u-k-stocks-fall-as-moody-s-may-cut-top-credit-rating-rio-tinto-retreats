U.K. stocks  were little changed
after Moody’s Investors Service said it may cut Britain’s top
Aaa rating and economic reports showed U.S. retail sales missed
forecasts and German investor confidence unexpectedly rose.  Rio Tinto Group, the world’s third-largest mining company,
led declines, losing 3.1 percent. Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc slipped 5.2 percent.  Yell Group Plc (YELL)  tumbled 17 percent after
saying third-quarter sales fell.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  advanced
1.5 percent as a South African refinery partly owned by the
company resumed operations.  The  FTSE 100  fell 5.83, or 0.1 percent, to 5,899.87 at the
close in London, after earlier losing as much as 0.5 percent and
gaining 0.3 percent in intraday trading. The gauge has  still
climbed 19 percent  from last year’s lowest level on Oct. 4. The
FTSE All-Share Index also lost 0.1 percent today, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index retreated less than 0.1 percent.  “There is a clear lack of love between the FTSE and the
5900 mark, as the market ends its brief sojourn above this level
and drops lower once again,” said Chris Beauchamp, market
analyst at IG Index. “It is looking as if all the wooing in the
world will not succeed in pushing the FTSE higher from here.”  Moody’s said after markets closed yesterday that it may cut
the Aaa ratings of the U.K. and  France , citing the euro-area
debt crisis. The company downgraded the ratings of six other
countries in the region, including Spain, Portugal and Italy.  U.S. Retail Sales  Stocks declined earlier as U.S. retail sales rose 0.4
percent in January, half the 0.8 percent increase forecast by
economists in a Bloomberg News survey, reflecting an unexpected
drop in car purchases.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in  Mannheim ,
 Germany , said its index of investor and analyst expectations
rose to 5.4 in February from minus 21.6 in January. That’s the
highest in 10 months and beat the  median economist forecast  of
minus 11.8, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.K. inflation slowed to its weakest pace in 14 months in
January, the Office for National Statistics said today. Consumer
prices rose an annual 3.6 percent after a 4.2 percent gain in
December. Officials will “pay particular attention” to the
outlook for the euro area’s economy, said  Bank of England 
Governor  Mervyn King .  Commodity Shares  A  gauge  of mining stocks retreated 1.7 percent, as copper
fell for a third day in  New York . Rio Tinto Group fell 3.1
percent to 3,727.5 pence. The company approved a $4.5 billion
expansion of Chile’s Escondida copper mine with  BHP Billiton
Ltd. (BHP)   BHP Billiton  slid 0.5 percent to 2,072 pence.  A  gauge  of banking stocks fell 1.1 percent. RBS declined
5.2 percent to 26.65 pence, while  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) 
receded 2.9 percent to 34.29 pence.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  traded 0.5
percent lower at 561.5 pence.  Yell Group, the publisher of the Yellow Pages directories,
plummeted 17 percent to 4.87 pence, its biggest decline since
Nov. 16. The company reported that  group revenue  for the quarter
through December fell 15 percent.  Shell climbed 1.5 percent to 2,331.5 pence as oil rose to
its highest price in three weeks.  Bunzl Plc (BNZL) , the world’s largest distributor of disposable
tableware and food packaging, advanced 3.7 percent to 910.5
pence after it was raised to “overweight” from “neutral” at
JPMorgan.  Capita Plc advanced 2.1 percent to 648 pence after the
British army selected the company as a recommended supplier for
its recruiting partnering project.  -- Editor: Srinivasan Sivabalan  To contact the reporter on this story:
