Australian  business confidence  rose
to an eight-month high in January after the central bank cut
 interest rates  twice late last year and concern eased about
Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis, a private survey showed.  The  confidence index  climbed to 4 last month from 3 in
December, a  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  survey of more than 400
companies from Jan. 19-Feb. 2 released in Sydney today showed.
That was the highest since May. The business conditions gauge, a
measure of hiring, sales and profits, rose to 2 from zero.  The  Reserve Bank  of  Australia  reduced the benchmark rate by
a quarter percentage point on Nov. 1 and again on Dec. 6 as
inflation pressures eased. Australia recorded its worst annual
job growth in 19 years in 2011 as consumers boosted savings amid
concern about potential fallout from fiscal problems in the U.S.
and Europe.  “Business confidence was relatively firm in the month,
with businesses seemingly still taking relief from the recent
RBA rate cuts as well as some abatement of concerns about
 Europe ,” NAB Chief Economist Alan Oster said in a statement.
“Nonetheless, labor market conditions remain soft and the
overall outlook for near-term activity remains moderate.”  The local currency has risen about 5 percent this year and
reached a six-month high of $1.0845 last week after the RBA
unexpectedly kept the nation’s benchmark borrowing cost
unchanged at 4.25 percent at its Feb. 7 meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
