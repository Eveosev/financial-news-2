Urbi (URBI*)  Desarrollos Urbanos SAB,
Mexico’s third-largest homebuilder by sales, plunged the most in
three years after reporting that a measure of cash flow last
year trailed the company’s projections.  Urbi dropped 19.2 percent to 16.88 pesos at the close in
Mexico City, the biggest decline since Oct. 10, 2008.
Desarrolladora Homex SAB, Mexico’s largest homebuilder, fell 9.3
percent to 42.93 pesos today, while Corp. Geo SAB, the second-
biggest, dropped 14.4 percent to 18.99 pesos. The  benchmark IPC 
index of 35 Mexican stocks fell 1 percent.  Mexican homebuilders have struggled to produce positive
cash flow as they shifted their focus to government-subsidized
apartment buildings that cost more to build. Urbi’s free  cash
flow  to equity, or FCFE, was negative 3 billion pesos ($235
million) to negative 3.5 billion pesos for 2011, according to
preliminary results published yesterday. The company had
projected it would be negative 800 million pesos for the year.  Cash flow concerns are “materializing,” Credit Suisse
Group AG analysts led by  Vanessa Quiroga  wrote in a research
note e-mailed today. The industry’s outperformance this year on
the Mexican benchmark stock gauge “has been unjustified,” they
said.  Urbi rose 32 percent this year though yesterday, after the
industry posted the worst performance on the benchmark index in
2011.  The homebuilder was hurt in the last three months of the
year by “delays in the expected availability” of government
subsidies, the company said in the statement yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
