OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest
lender, dropped after Moody’s Investors Service downgraded six
European countries and Hungary’s government said it may face
more hurdles in its quest to obtain an international bailout.  The shares slid 2.7 percent to 3,930 forint by the close in
Budapest. The benchmark BUX stock index, in which OTP has a 29
percent weighting, declined 0.8 percent. The MSCI Emerging
Markets Index fell as much as 0.6 percent after Moody’s reduced
the sovereign ratings of  Spain , Italy, Portugal, Malta and
Hungary’s neigbors Slovakia and Slovenia, increasing concern
that the debt crisis is spreading.  Hungary, the European Union’s most indebted eastern member,
may face more legal disputes with the European Commission as it
works to resolve earlier conflicts that obstructed talks with
the European Union and the  International Monetary Fund  on a
bailout, Deputy Prime Minister Tibor Navracsics said today.  “A substantial move forward in the talks with the EU and
IMF is needed for Hungarian shares to bounce back,”  Akos Kuti ,
a Budapest-based analyst at Equilor Befektetesi Zrt., and
colleagues wrote in a research report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
