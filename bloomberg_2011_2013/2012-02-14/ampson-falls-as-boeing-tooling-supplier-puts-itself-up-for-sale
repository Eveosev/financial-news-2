Hampson Industries Plc (HAMP)  slumped the
most in 18 months in London trading after the U.K. maker of
tooling systems for airplane manufacturing put itself up for
sale as it tries to refinance debt.  The U.K. manufacturer, whose tooling systems are used for
Boeing’s 787 and Airbus’s A350, dropped as much as 33 percent,
to 5.2 pence, the biggest intraday decline since Aug. 12, 2010.
The stock traded at 5.75 as of 8:39 a.m., giving the company a
market value of 16.8 million pounds ($26.4 million).  Hampson named DC Advisory Partners and Sagent Advisors Inc.
to handle the sale as it is reviewing “all financing and
 strategic options ,” the Brierley Hill, England-based company
said today in a statement. The company had net debt of 54.9
million pounds as of Feb. 5.  Chief Executive Officer Norman Jordan has been conducting a
review of the company and has been looking into asset disposals.
Hampson received indicative offers for units including BHW and
the Indian operations of its aerostructures and composites
business, the company added.  Some deliveries for the company’s largest tooling order
might slip to fiscal 2013 following issues identified during the
testing and customer approval process, the company added in the
statement. Discussions with the customer are ongoing.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
