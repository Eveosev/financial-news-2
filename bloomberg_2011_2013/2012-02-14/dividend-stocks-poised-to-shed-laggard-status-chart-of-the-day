Dividend-paying stocks are still a
“winning theme” for investors even though they have gotten off
to a relatively slow start this year, according to Gina Martin Adams, a strategist at  Wells Fargo Securities LLC .  The CHART OF THE DAY tracks the performance of the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, composed of companies
that have raised payouts for at least 25 consecutive years,
relative to the  S&P 500 .  While the dividend-aristocrat index rose 4.2 percent for
the year through yesterday, the gain was 2.6 percentage points
smaller than the S&P 500’s advance. By contrast, the indicator
fared better than the S&P 500 in the past two years, its first
back-to-back wins since 2002.  Payout ratios suggest companies can distribute plenty more
money to shareholders, Martin Adams wrote yesterday in a report.
She noted that dividends equal 27 percent of S&P 500 earnings,
the lowest figure in more than a century, according to  data 
compiled by Yale University Professor  Robert Shiller .  “Companies may be only just beginning to catch on to the
fact that investors are keenly interested in dividend-paying
stocks,” the report said.  Dividends may be in relatively high demand for years,
 Martin Adams  wrote, as debt-reduction efforts result in slower
earnings growth and an aging population favors investments that
produce income.  To contact the reporter on this story:
