U.S. Bancorp (USB)  and  East West Bancorp
Inc. (EWBC)  created a $47 million fund to finance renewable-energy
projects that Borrego Solar Systems Inc. will install in
California and Massachusetts.  The fund will be used to build 14 systems with direct
current generating capacity of 11 megawatts, Bill Bush, chief
financial officer of Berkeley, California-based Borrego, said by
e-mail.  Borrego’s customers buy the electricity from systems it
installs through a financing arrangement known as a power
purchase agreement. The structure eliminates the need to pay
upfront installation costs, and the power is bought at a fixed
monthly rate that’s lower than a typical utility bill, according
to the company.  Banks or other investors, including utilities, that create
installation funds can take advantage of a 30 percent investment
tax credit for solar energy.  U.S. Bank  and East West Bank created a similar $46 million
fund for Borrego in June and provided $56 million in project
financing prior to that.  To contact the reporter on this story:
