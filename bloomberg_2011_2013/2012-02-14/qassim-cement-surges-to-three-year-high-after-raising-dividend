Qassim Cement Co. (QACCO)  surged to the
highest level in more than three years after the Saudi producer
of the building material increased the size of its cash
dividend.  The shares rallied 4.6 percent to 79.5 riyals, the highest
intraday level since July 2008, at 11:40 a.m. in  Riyadh .  The companyâ€™s board proposed paying a second-half dividend
of 3.5 riyals a share, Qassim said in statement to the bourse
today. This would take the full-year dividend to 5.75 riyals a
share, up 15 percent from the previous year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
