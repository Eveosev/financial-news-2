PT Chandra Asri (TPIA) , an Indonesian
petrochemical producer, is trying to attract an additional three
banks to its $150 million loan, according to a person familiar
with the matter.  The seven-year facility was signed in November and arranged
by DBS Bank Ltd., HSBC Holdings Plc and Standard Chartered Plc,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The loan, which pays a
margin of 600 basis points, later attracted PT Bank Danamon
 Indonesia , the data show.  Jakarta-based Chandra Asri subsequently asked the arrangers
to consider the involvement of another three lenders after those
banks expressed an interest in joining the facility, the person
said today, declining to elaborate. The potential three new
banks will be given about a month to process credit approvals,
the person said.  Chandra Asri corporate secretary and investor relations
director Suryandi was in a meeting and not immediately available
to comment on the financing when called at his office in Jakarta
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
