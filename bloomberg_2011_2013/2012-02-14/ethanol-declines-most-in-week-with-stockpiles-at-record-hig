Ethanol fell the most in more than a
week in  Chicago  on speculation that demand won’t be robust
enough to lower record stockpiles.  Futures declined for the second time in three days before
the Energy Department reports tomorrow on  inventories , which
gained eight weeks in a row to reach 21.1 million barrels in the
week ended Feb. 3. Ethanol is blended with gasoline to stretch
supply.  “We continue to have a lot of material in the prompt
months,” said Justin Dirico, senior ethanol trader at SCB &
Associates in Chicago.  Denatured ethanol for March delivery fell 2.2 cents, or 1
percent, to $2.213 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
steepest decline since Feb. 2. Prices are down 9.6 percent from
a year ago.  Ethanol inventories are 7.6 percent higher than a year
earlier, the Energy Department said in its Feb. 8 report. Demand
slipped to an 11-week low that week.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago sank 2 cents, or
0.9 percent, to $2.18 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel
lost 2 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.235, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  slid 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.29 a
gallon and on the West Coast the additive dropped 1.5 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $2.29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
