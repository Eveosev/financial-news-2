Support for Slovakia’s ruling
coalition and the main opposition party fell one month before
elections as anti-corruption protests bolstered newcomers
calling for elimination of graft, a poll showed.  The four parties in Iveta Radicova’s Cabinet would muster a
combined 28.3 percent, according to a poll conducted Feb. 1-7 by
Focus, a private company, compared with 30.4 percent in January.
Smer, the largest opposition party, would gain 37.3 percent,
down from 41.8 percent, the Bratislava, Slovakia-based Focus
said today.  The public mood in the eastern European country facing the
vote on March 10 is influenced by a leaked suspected
intelligence file, which suggests ties between politicians and
local businessmen during the 2002-2006 rule of former premier
and current Foreign Affairs Minister Mikulas Dzurinda. Support
for his SDKU party dropped to 6.1 percent from 10.2 percent in
December.  The public discontent over corruption, which led to a
series of rallies across the country in the past month, is
helping new parties, according to the poll. Ordinary People and
99 Percent, both established last year, would gain 8.9 percent
and 6.9 percent, respectively, according to the poll conducted
on a sample of 1,053 respondents. No margin of error was given.  The following is a table of preferences for parties, which
would be represented in parliament, according to the Focus poll:  Party                  February, %                January, %  Source: Focus; * - member of the current ruling coalition  To contact the reporter on this story:
