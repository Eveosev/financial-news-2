Boeing Co. (BA)  signed a 230-aircraft
order worth $22.4 billion at list prices from Indonesian budget
carrier PT Lion Mentari Airlines, setting a record for the
planemaker.  The accord today at the  Singapore  Airshow, which solidifies
a provisional agreement last year, includes 201 orders for the
in-development 737 MAX and 29 for the extended range 737-900. 
Airbus SAS separately announced a contract for 35 of its planned
A320neo aircraft from Kuwait-based Aviation Lease & Finance Co.  The two planemakers are working on more fuel-efficient
versions of their single-aisle aircraft as they compete for
customers in a segment accounting for about 60 percent of the
 global fleet . The companies’ stranglehold on the market is also
under threat as Commercial Aircraft Corp. of  China  and
 Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)  develop their first planes of that size.  Chinese planemaker Comac today announced orders for 20 of
its C919 plane from BOC Aviation Pte, the leasing unit of Bank
of China Ltd. The aircraft is the nation’s first large passenger
jet.  The Lion Air order, which also includes 150 options, is
Boeing’s largest in terms of dollar value and aircraft numbers.
It surpasses a Southwest Airlines Co. deal for 208 737s signed
in December and comes about a month after a European record
order for 122 737s from Norwegian Air Shuttle AS. Airlines
usually receive discounts for large orders.  Lion Air Funding  Lion Air intends to use export-credit agency financing,
bank loans and sale-and-leaseback deals to help pay for the
planes, said President Director Rusdi Kirana.  The carrier may also hold an initial public offering once
its market share has reached 60 percent from 51 percent, he
said. That could happen within the next two years, he said. The
airline is able to wait as it is making money, Kirana said.  The Jakarta-based company expected to carry 27 million
passengers last year, an increase of 30 percent, and it has
forecast future growth of about 15 percent a year. It already
operates or has orders for 178 of the existing versions of the
737, according to Boeing.  The 737 MAX aircraft, which is due to enter service in
2017, will pare fuel use and  carbon emissions  by as much as 12
percent compared with current single-aisle planes, according to
the planemaker. It will use engines made by CFM International
Inc., a venture between  General Electric Co. (GE)  and  Safran SA. (SAF)   Airbus had 1,256 orders for A320neo family planes at the
end of last year, according to its  Website . The aircraft, which
also features new engines, is due to enter service in  2016 .  To contact the reporter on this story:
