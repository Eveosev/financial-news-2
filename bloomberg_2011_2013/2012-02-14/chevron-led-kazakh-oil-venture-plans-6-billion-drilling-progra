Chevron Corp. (CVX) ’s Kazakh oil venture
plans to spend $5 billion to $6 billion in the next five years
drilling at Tengiz, the Central Asian country’s biggest
producing field,to sustain output.  The TengizChevroil LLP venture will invest $1 billion of
that amount to drill three to four wells this year, starting in
April, General Director  Tim Miller  told reporters in Almaty
today, without giving a production forecast for 2012.  Crude output fell 0.4 percent last year to 25.8 million
metric tons, or almost 565,000 barrels a day, the venture said
on Jan. 30.  The venture wants to invest $15 billion to $20 billion to
raise output through 2016, Deputy Head Anuarbek Dzhakiyev said
in June last year, citing preliminary data. The plan, which
hadn’t been submitted to  Kazakhstan ’s government, is designed to
raise annual output to 36 million metric tons, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
