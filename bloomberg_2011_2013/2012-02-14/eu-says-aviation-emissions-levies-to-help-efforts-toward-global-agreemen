The European Union said its
introduction of emissions levies on aviation will help spur
efforts toward a global agreement.  The EU’s program is “a concrete step, which at least
forces people to take positions,” Transport Commissioner Siim Kallas said today in an interview in  Singapore , where he is
attending an air show.  Countries including China and  India  have objected to the
addition of aviation to the European carbon-trading system last
month because of concerns about costs and sovereignty. Airlines
have also called for the program to be halted in favor of a
planned global system.  “I would like to see what exactly the others want,”
Kallas said. “If they want that we simply suspend or abolish
our system, this is not acceptable.”  The  International Civil Aviation Organization , a United
Nations agency, is leading efforts to draw up a global emissions
system. The EU can drop overseas airlines from its system if
their home governments introduce a similar program.  Kallas also said the European Commission has no plans to
add road transport to the emissions-trading system. The
commission is instead focusing on tax and regulations to pare
pollution from vehicles.  To contact the reporters on this story:
