PepsiCo Inc. will sell its Quaker
oats products in  Russia  under the Chudo brand that it acquired
along with dairy producer OAO Wimm-Bill-Dann, Vedomosti
reported, citing the company.  PepsiCo, which sold $2.7 billion of Quaker oats in  North
America  last year, estimates the Russian market for hot cereals
at $218 million a year, making it Europeâ€™s largest after the
U.K., the Moscow-based newspaper said.  PepsiCo may consider selling some of its Russian brands
abroad, Vedomosti said. Chudo is the Russian word for miracle.  To contact the reporter on this story:
