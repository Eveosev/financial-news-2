Liquefied natural gas markets may
face a glut by 2018 as about 250 million metric tons a year of
new supply comes online, according to Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.  Projects that are planned but have yet to reach the final
investment-decision stage might add 68 million metric tons a
year of supply by 2020, the company said in a research note
today. Additional projects at a more speculative stage may add
a further 183 million tons of capacity,  Neil Beveridge , an 
energy analyst at Bernstein in  Hong Kong , wrote in the report.  “Despite the short-term tightness, a new wave of long-term
LNG investment is building, which will lead to a massive
increase in global LNG capacity by 2016/2017 and could
ultimately spark the next global glut of LNG,” Beveridge wrote.  Spare capacity is expected to reach historic lows in 2013,
with few LNG projects scheduled to begin operations before then
as demand increases, according to the report.  Global demand may rise to 408 million metric tons a year by
2020, when Australia will become the leading global supplier of
the fuel, Bernstein said. Eight major LNG projects have been
approved in  Australia  in the past two years, creating about 70
million tons a year of capacity, according to the report.  The company forecast that few additional LNG projects will
be approved in Australia, as production shifts to  North America 
and east  Africa , where gas recovery costs are lower. New
projects producing 40 million tons a year of LNG may be
built in North America before 2020, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
