Robusta coffee futures may extend a
13 percent rally in the past five days after entering a  bull
market  as exports dwindle from Vietnam, the largest producer.  Prices may jump to $2,150 a metric ton on the NYSE Liffe
exchange before the expiration of the March options tomorrow,
according to Keith Flury, an analyst at Rabobank International
in London. That’s 3.7 percent higher than yesterday’s close of
$2,074 a ton, a 21 percent increase from the low in January. A
20 percent rally or more from lows is defined as a bull market.  Options traders increased bets on higher prices by 25
percent this month, exchange data show. Investors held 7,175
 call options  giving them the right to buy March coffee futures
at $1,950 a ton as of Feb. 10. That’s up from 5,725 on Jan. 31,
when the March contract closed at $1,836 a ton. The $1,950
strike was the most widely held call option for March.  “The market could see levels as high as $2,150 a ton due
to a large bet placed on the options,” Flury said by phone from
 London  yesterday. “The large open interest in the call option
at $1,950 a ton for March has attracted futures buying.”  Robusta coffee has climbed over the past week on reduced
exports from Vietnam, the world’s largest producer of the beans
used in instant coffee and espresso, and roaster buying. The
beans for March delivery rose 1.6 percent to $2,107 a metric ton
by 12:27 p.m. on NYSE Liffe in London. The price touched $2,108
a ton earlier, the highest since Sept. 21.  The beans for March delivery became more expensive than the
May contract for the first time on Feb. 9, signaling limited
supplies. Beans for March delivery are $142 a ton more than May-
delivered coffee.  Only Supplier  Vietnam ’s coffee exports were 112,182 tons in January, down
48 percent from a year earlier, according to the country’s
General Customs Department. About 35 percent of the country’s
crop had been sold before the Tet new year holiday, down from an
anticipated 50 percent, according to broker Marex Spectron Group
in London. The Tet festival ran from Jan. 23 to Jan. 27.  “Vietnam, the only volume supplier of robusta at the
moment, is a good but disciplined seller, and demand is
constant,” Volcafe, the coffee unit of commodities trader ED&F
Man Holdings Ltd., said in a report e-mailed last week.  The harvest in  Brazil , the second-biggest grower of robusta
beans, usually starts in July, data from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture show. The crop in  Indonesia , the world’s third-
largest producer of robustas, starts in April, the USDA says.  ‘High Premiums’  “The high premiums in Indonesia coupled with export delays
in Vietnam are also supporting the market,” Flury said.  European roasters are tapping beans stockpiled in the
continent after inventories there rose to an all-time high last
year. Robusta coffee inventories with valid grading certificates
in warehouses monitored by NYSE Liffe stood at 227,170 tons as
of Feb. 6, down 46 percent from an all-time high of 417,420 tons
on July 11, according to the exchange figures.  Robusta coffee prices may fall again after the March
futures expiry, Flury said. The current crop in Vietnam will be
a record 21.5 million bags, according to Rabobank’s estimates.
Harvests in other producing regions will also start and the
reductions in Liffe stockpiles may slow, Marex Spectron said.  “For the moment the Vietnamese farmer can afford to be
relaxed,” Marex Spectron said in a report on Feb. 3. “However,
this window is closing and as we begin to roll through the
coffee year this will not be the case.  India  and West Africa
will be coming along soon, followed by Indonesia and
conillons,” or Brazilian robustas, it said.  Money managers were net-short, or betting on lower prices,
in robusta coffee as of Feb. 7, according to NYSE Liffe data.
Prices have since then climbed 13 percent. Net-short positions
totaled 6,873 futures and options, compared with 6,685 on Jan.
31, according to the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
