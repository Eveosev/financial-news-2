The largest glut of zinc in almost
two decades is threatening to curtail a rally in prices as
record production expands inventories to the highest since at
least 1984.  Supply will outpace demand by 539,000 metric tons, the most
since 1993, according to  Standard Bank  Plc. Stockpiles of the
metal used in brass and steel will reach 2.2 million tons,
Barclays Capital estimates. Prices will drop 10 percent to
$1,832 a ton this year, the median of 15 analyst and trader
estimates compiled by Bloomberg shows. That may curb profit for
Zug, Switzerland-based  Xstrata Plc (XTA) , the biggest producer.  Zinc rose 11 percent this year, rebounding from its biggest
annual drop since 2008, on signs economic growth is
accelerating. The six-member  London  Metal Exchange Index entered
a  bull market  last month after rallying more than 20 percent
from a 15-month low in October. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is warning
that some prices rallied too fast and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
withdrew a recommendation to buy zinc on Jan. 26 after prices
exceeded its 12-month forecast.  “There are not a lot of reasons why zinc should go
higher,” said  Bart Melek , the head of commodity strategy at TD
Securities Inc. in Toronto and the third most-accurate zinc-
price forecaster tracked by Bloomberg Rankings in the past eight
quarters. “It’s a surplus, and demand is being outpaced by
supply growth. We’re looking for a bit of a correction.”  Monitored Warehouses  The metal entered a bull market in January after rising 27
percent from the October low. It fell 3.6 percent last week as
orders to withdraw metal from LME-monitored warehouses plunged
41 percent, the most since January 2011. Zinc’s gain this year
to $2,042 compares with an 8.5 percent jump in the MSCI All-
Country World Index of equities and 5.5 percent advance in the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities. Treasuries
lost 0.4 percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.  Global production will increase 3.7 percent to 13.6 million
tons this year, led by a 7 percent gain in China, according to
 Barclays Capital . The Asian nation will account for 41 percent
of supply and 43 percent of consumption. Lower prices may not
spur mines to curb output because zinc ores typically yield
other metals that can sustain margins, Barclays said.  Standard Bank’s forecast for a surplus would be the biggest
in the bank’s data going back to 2000. It would be the most
since 1993, International Lead and Zinc Study Group data show.  Zinc Mines  Xstrata’s Mount Isa mine in  Australia  extracted 357,000
tons of zinc, 139,000 tons of lead and 204 tons of silver last
year, the company said in a report to investors Feb. 7. Its
Brunswick zinc mine in  Canada  also produces copper. Silver and
copper traded at record annual averages in 2011 and rose at
least 11 percent this year. About 90 percent of the world’s zinc
mines are profitable at about $1,490 a ton or more, or 27
percent below today’s price, according to Barclays.  Xstrata, which got a $37.6 billion takeover offer from
 Glencore International Plc (GLEN)  this month, will report record net
income of $5.88 billion in 2012, according to the mean of 14
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Its shares fell 21
percent in the past 12 months. Zinc and lead accounted for 11
percent of sales in 2011 and a $22-a-ton change in the price of
zinc translates into a $20 million move in its operating profit,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Traders may still be adding to bets on higher  prices . Open
interest, or contracts outstanding, in LME zinc futures climbed
7.3 percent this year, bourse data show. Rising open interest at
a time when prices are rallying suggests new so-called long
positions, according to Macquarie Group Ltd.  Central Banks  Investors may already be anticipating an end to the glut,
which Barclays says may come in 2014. Morgan Stanley is
predicting a 110,000-ton shortage next year, snapping six
consecutive annual surpluses. Prices more than doubled in 2009
even as supply outpaced demand.  Consumption may also exceed estimates as governments and
central banks move to shore up growth. The  Federal Reserve 
pledged last month to keep  interest rates  near zero until late
2014 and Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said he’s considering
additional bond purchases to boost the economy. The  Bank of
England  said on Feb. 9 it would add another 50 billion pounds
($79 billion) to the target for bond purchases.  “Prices will probably get a bit of support later in the
year because 2013 does look as though the market will begin to
start tightening up,” said  Gayle Berry , an analyst at Barclays
in London. “People will try to position themselves ahead of
that.”  LME Stockpiles  There are few signs that consumption is accelerating right
now. Stockpiles in LME-monitored warehouses rose 20 percent in
the past 12 months and at 848,050 tons are about 75 percent
higher than the average over the past decade. Canceled warrants,
or orders to withdraw metal from inventories, declined in 14 of
the past 15 weeks, LME data show.  Global output of galvanized sheet steel, which is rust-
proofed with zinc, fell 11 percent in the fourth quarter,
according to Macquarie. Galvanizing accounts for 57 percent of
zinc demand, Royal Bank of Scotland Group estimates. Growth in
property investment spending in  China  should slow to about 15
percent this year, from 23 percent in 2011, curbing consumption
of steel used in construction, Barclays estimates.  The  International Monetary Fund  cut its 2012 growth
forecast on Jan. 24 to 3.3 percent from 4 percent and warned
that  Europe ’s debt crisis threatened to derail the world
economy. The  World Bank  reduced its estimate by the most in
three years on Jan. 18, to 2.5 percent from 3.6 percent.  “It’s significantly oversupplied,” said Jesper Dannesboe,
an analyst at Societe Generale SA in London. “There is no
incentive for zinc producers to cut back. If demand is not
improving for zinc, then the price will have to fall again.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
