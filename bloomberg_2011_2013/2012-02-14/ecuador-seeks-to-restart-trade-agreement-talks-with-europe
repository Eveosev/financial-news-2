Ecuador  is seeking an “affirmative
response” from the European Union to restart trade talks stalled
since the government of  South America ’s seventh-biggest economy
stopped negotiations in 2009.  Ecuador, the world’s biggest banana exporter, wants a
“commercial agreement for development” that includes technology
and knowledge transfer, Francisco Rivadeneira, deputy minister
of commerce at the Foreign Ministry, said today in an e-mailed
statement. President  Rafael Correa  has said he won’t sign a
traditional free trade agreement.  “There is openness on the part of the European bloc to have
a dialogue about all issues,” Rivadeneira said. “We hope the
questioning process is concluded.”  Negotiations have stumbled over intellectual property rights
and public purchases, Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino said last
week. Rivadeneira met with Antonia Van Gool, the chief of the
EU’s mission for Ecuador, in  Quito  today to work out details of
talks ahead of Patino’s planned visit to Brussels on March 19,
according to the statement.  Ecuador broke off negotiations with the EU in 2009 amid a
dispute over tariffs on Ecuador’s banana exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
