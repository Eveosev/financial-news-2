Gulf Air, Bahrain’s state-owned
carrier, is planning to stop flights to Damascus,  Athens , Milan
and  Kuala Lumpur  as the routes were underperforming, the airline
said in an e-mailed statement.  “These closures are pragmatic commercial decisions aimed
at focusing services on routes with higher passenger traffic,”
Chief Executive Officer Samer Majali said in the statement.  Services to Damascus will stop from March 2 while flights
to Athens and Milan will be halted from March 12. The Kuala
Lumpur service will cease on March 25, said the statement.  The airline is seeking to address economic challenges,
including concern about local and regional political stability
as well as the high price of fuel and low passenger numbers.  “The decision has been taken to allow the airline to use
its fleet and resources in the most efficient way by
concentrating on high-demand, high-yield routes to ensure that
its core customer base is served effectively,” the statement
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
