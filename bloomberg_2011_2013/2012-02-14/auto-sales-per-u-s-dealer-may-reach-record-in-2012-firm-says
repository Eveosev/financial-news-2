U.S. auto sales per dealership may
rise to a record in 2012 as demand increases and automakers’
dealership networks stabilize, according to an industry
consulting firm.  Sales per dealer increased 9.6 percent to 719 vehicles last
year, dealership consultant Urban Science said today in its
annual Automotive Franchise Activity Report. The figure may rise
about 9.2 percent to 785 vehicle sales per dealer this year,
surpassing the record of 784 vehicles in 2005, the Detroit-based
firm said in an e-mailed statement.  The number of U.S. auto dealerships rose 0.6 percent last
year to 17,767, led by Chrysler Group LLC’s additions of stores
selling cars from its majority owner  Fiat SpA (F) , according to the
report. The increase in the dealer count last year, the
industry’s first since 2000, followed a 4.4 percent drop in 2010
and 8 percent decline in 2009.  “You’re seeing a more healthy, more profitable dealer
network,” John Frith, an Urban Science vice president, told
reporters today in a briefing in  Detroit . The challenge for
automakers will be “to avoid reacting to the increased sales
levels by adding a lot of dealers and potentially reversing some
of these trends,” he said.  The number of U.S. auto dealerships usually falls about 2
percent annually, said Urban Science, which has compiled its
annual report since 1990. Chrysler was the largest contributor
to the industry breaking that trend in 2011, adding 135 Fiat
dealerships and 50 Chrysler-Dodge-Jeep stores. Last year and
2000 are the only years that the industry increased its dealer
count since Urban Science began the annual report.  GM, Chrysler  General Motors Co. (GM) , the largest U.S. automaker, and
Chrysler eliminated more than 2,200 dealers as part of their
government-backed bankruptcy reorganizations in 2009.  Ford Motor
Co. (F)  also has consolidated its dealer network as it shed the
Mercury brand and cut the number of Lincoln stores in U.S.
metropolitan markets.  U.S. automakers have shrunk their dealer networks to avoid
having their dealers compete with each another in the same
markets and to boost profitability of remaining outlets.  Urban Science bases its outlook for sales per dealership
using the National Automobile Dealers Association’s estimate
that 13.9 million vehicles will be sold industrywide in the U.S.
this year. The industry averaged 16.8 million annual sales from
2000 to 2007, according to  Woodcliff Lake , New Jersey-based
researcher Autodata Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
