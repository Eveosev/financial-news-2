The cost of insuring  Asia ’s
corporate and sovereign bonds from default increased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index rose 4 basis points to 151 as
of 9:02 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG prices show. The Markit
iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade borrowers outside Japan
climbed 0.5 basis points to 164.5 as of 8.38 a.m. from
yesterday’s close in  Hong Kong , according to Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc prices.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was unchanged to 145
basis points as of 11.24 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking Corp
prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
