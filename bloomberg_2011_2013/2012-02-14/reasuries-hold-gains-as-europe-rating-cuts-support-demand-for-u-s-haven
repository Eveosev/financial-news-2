Treasuries (YCGT0025)  fell for the first time
in four days after People’s Bank of  China  Governor Zhou Xiaochun
said China will participate in solving Europe’s debt crisis,
reducing demand for haven assets.  “China could make Europe’s problems go away,” said  Peter Jolly , head of market research at National Australia Bank Ltd.
in Sydney. “They have the funds. To the extent that China will
participate in the European solution, it takes away some of the
flight to quality in Treasuries.”  Ten-year  yields  rose two basis points to 1.96 percent as of
12:01 p.m. in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.
The 2 percent security due February 2022 declined 6/32, or $1.88
per $1,000 face amount, to 100 3/8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
