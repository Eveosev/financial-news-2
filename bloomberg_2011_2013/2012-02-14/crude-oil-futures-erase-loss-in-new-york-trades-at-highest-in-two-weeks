Oil traded near a two-week high in
 New York  as the prospect of escalating tensions between Iran and
Western nations spurred speculation of supply disruptions in the
Persian Gulf.  Futures reached their highest price since Jan. 31, erasing
earlier losses. Standard & Poor’s said in a report today that
Iran might respond to sanctions by slowing shipping through the
Strait of Hormuz with such obstructions to traffic as tanker
inspections and boarding of merchant ships.  “Such low-scale provocation and simmering tension would in
our view keep  oil prices  at their currently high level,”
Standard & Poor’s said. “This is because markets would
increasingly view the specter of armed conflict as a real, if
remote, possibility.”  Crude for March delivery on the New York Mercantile
Exchange rose as much as 27 cents to $101.18 a barrel and was at
$100.95 at 9:05 a.m. London time. The contract earlier fell as
much as 0.5 percent to $100.37.  To contact the reporter on this story:
