Zipcar Inc. (ZIP)  fell the most since its
initial public offering 10 months ago after forecasting first-
quarter profit that was lower than analysts’ estimates as it
boosts marketing and other expenses to expand in  Europe .  Zipcar, which rents cars by the hour or day, dropped as
much as 16 percent, the biggest intraday slide as a public
company. Shares fell 14 percent to $13.90 at 12:50 p.m. New York
time. The shares had risen 20 percent this year before today.  The company said it will report a net loss of as much as $5
million this quarter, typically its slowest. Based on the
average 42.2 million shares outstanding in the fourth quarter,
that equates to a loss of as much as 12 cents a share. That’s a
larger loss than the average estimate of a 7-cent deficit of
three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The company said during a conference call today that it
expects costs of about $2 million this year, related to its new
European headquarters and new executives, including Frerk-Malte Feller, hired last month to run Zipcar Europe. Zipcar, which is
based in Cambridge,  Massachusetts , said sales this quarter would
be as much as $60 million, trailing the average $60.6 million
estimate of three analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
