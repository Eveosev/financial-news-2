On Friday Obama's presidential campaign marked its fifth anniversary (that's  wood , if you'd care to send a gift, though I am sure he will accept cash) by posting a video. Despite its cringeworthy title, " The Story of Us " is a surprisingly effective reminder of what a good candidate  Barack Obama  was -- which is also part of its problem. Anything that reduces five years to four minutes and 32 seconds, the length of " The Story of Us ," is going to leave some stuff out. As a campaign video, it can’t be expected to highlight Obama's record on Guantanamo or his management of Congress. Even so, from watching " The Story of Us " it's easy to get the impression that Barack Obama was better as a candidate than he's been as president -- which sounds a lot like one of the  standard right-wing critiques  of the 44th president. The video starts on Feb. 10, 2007, when then-Senator Obama steps to a podium in front of the Illinois State Capitol in Springfield to announce his candidacy. He wins  Iowa . He survives an attack of  lip-synching singers and actors .  Shepard Fairey  makes  a poster  of him. He talks on his cellphone while smiling handsomely. He names  Joe Biden  his running mate. He accepts his party's nomination for president of the  United States . He  brushes off  insults from the Evil Villain Sarah Palin (actually, that clip is from a speech about  Hillary Clinton , but -- never mind). He dances with  Ellen DeGeneres  while smiling handsomely. He fist-bumps Michelle. Michelle fist-bumps hosts of "The View." He votes for himself, after which he smiles handsomely. Finally, at precisely two minutes and 13 seconds into the video, we reach Jan. 20, 2009, when Obama is sworn in, although he doesn’t really start working for another 10 seconds. Only two minutes left to get through the next three years! A banjo adds a sense of urgency. The passage of the health care law takes all of about seven seconds.  Sonia Sotomayor  and Elana Kagan  scroll by. He kills a fly during a TV interview. He signs the  Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act . He sings Al Green (that was just a few weeks ago). He repeals "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" (that was a few months ago). He announces the killing of  Osama Bin Laden  (that was almost a year ago). He rescues the  auto industry , helps create jobs, and fights for the middle class (all of those projects are, as they say, ongoing). And he ends the war in Iraq. So what does this whirlwind tour of the Obama presidency tell us? First, it is a useful reminder that Obama is a formidable campaigner, one who has yet to turn his full attention to his re-election. Second, when he finally does, his campaign is as likely to focus on the magic of 2008 as on the reality of 2012. If all else fails, maybe nostalgia can motivate the base.
