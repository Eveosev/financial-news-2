Bank of East Asia Ltd. ,  Hong Kong ’s
third-largest lender, posted the biggest decline in almost two
weeks after 2011 profit fell short of analyst estimates and its
risk buffer shrank.  Net income  rose to HK$4.36 billion ($562 million), or
HK$1.96 a share, from HK$4.22 billion, or HK$1.92, a year
earlier, the bank said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock
exchange today. Profit missed the HK$4.63 billion average
 estimate  of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The core capital
adequacy ratio shrank to 9.4 percent from 9.8 percent in 2010.  Shares (23)  of the lender fell 2.8 percent to HK$29.75, the
biggest decline since Feb. 1, lagging behind a 0.2 percent gain
in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index . The family-run bank led by 72-
year-old David Li, which increased revenue by expanding in  China 
and tapping cross-border funding demand from Hong Kong companies
that have operations on the mainland, may need to increase
capital to continue growing.  “Investors are worried that Bank of  East Asia  might need
to raise funds and its  credit quality  in China might worsen,”
Ronald Wan, a managing director at China Merchant Securities
Co., said by telephone. “Bank of East Asia’s profit growth is
at the low end of market expectations. Its need to raise capital
might be reflected soon.”  The net interest margin, a measure of lending
profitability, shrank to 1.75 percent from 1.78 percent a year
earlier. Net interest income, or the difference between revenue
from lending and payments on deposits, climbed 23 percent to
HK$9.26 billion, while net fee and commission income rose 13.6
percent to HK$3.34 billion.  ‘Comfortable’ Capital Ratio  “We’re constantly monitoring our capital ratio and
continue to look for good financing channels, but we’re
comfortable with our existing ratio,” Brian Li, a deputy chief
executive officer, told reporters in Hong Kong today. “We have
enough capital for our business development.”  Deputy CEO Samson Li said the bank will look into
increasing capital “internally” and examine measures including
adjusting its loan mix and selling non-core properties.  Pretax profit from China last year increased 71 percent to
HK$2.44 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
