Installation of solar panels in the
U.S. surged as much as 67 percent in the fourth quarter as
developers raced to qualify for an expiring federal incentive
program and panel prices  fell  16 percent, a trade group said.  Developers installed 700 megawatts to 750 megawatts of
rooftop and ground-mounted systems in the quarter, compared with
450 megawatts in the third quarter, according to preliminary
estimates from the Washington-based  Solar Energy Industries
Association .  Installations this year may grow by 3,000 megawatts to
4,000 megawatts, up from about 1,800 megawatts in 2011, if a
U.S. Treasury Department incentive known as the 1603 program is
renewed, said  Rhone Resch , the trade group’s chief executive
officer.  Last year “was an incredible year and 2012 could be even
better if Congress extends the grant program,” Resch said in an
interview today.  President  Barack Obama  included 1603 in the proposed
federal budget released yesterday and SEIA is lobbying to have
it attached to the payroll tax extension Congress is debating
now.  The 1603 program offered cash grants of as much as 30
percent of development costs for renewable energy projects.  The grant program was enacted in 2009 to encourage
investors to back renewable-energy projects. It’s helped develop
more than $24 billion of power plants fueled by wind, solar and
other renewable sources, Resch said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
