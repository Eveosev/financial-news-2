Israel ’s consumer price-linked bonds
fell to the lowest level in more than a week amid investor bets
slowing economic growth and declining housing costs will push
inflation lower.  The yield on the consumer price-linked notes due June 2013
rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 0.26 percent
at 3:59 p.m. in  Tel Aviv , the highest since Feb. 6. The  one-year
break-even rate , the difference between inflation- linked bonds
and fixed-rate government bonds of similar maturity, retreated
for the first time this month, declining two basis points to
225. That implies an average annual inflation rate of 2.25
percent.  Consumer prices fell 0.2 percent last month after being
unchanged in December, according to the median estimate of 10
economists in a Bloomberg  survey . Inflation probably eased to an
annual 1.9 percent from 2.2 percent, according to a  survey  of 12
economists. The statistics bureau will release the data
tomorrow.  Home prices  fell about 1 percent in the fourth quarter
from the previous one, the Justice Ministry said today.  “The downtrend in domestic activity and private
consumption continues, while exports are weakening,” said
 Rafael Gozlan , chief economist at I.B.I.-Israel Brokerage &
Investments Ltd. in Tel Aviv. “Furthermore a slowdown in the
pace of the increase in rental prices in coming months is
expected to lead to a decrease in the inflation environment.”  Growth Slows  The yield on the 5.5 percent notes due January 2022
increased two basis points to 4.62 percent, the highest since
Dec. 15. The economy may expand “a little less” than 3 percent
in 2012 as exports decline, the IMF said yesterday, down from
its 3.6 percent September forecast. Israel posted its widest
trade deficit since at least 1995 in January as the European
debt crisis weakened global growth and exports fell, the
statistics bureau said Feb. 12.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period, rose one basis point to
2.46 percent. The  Bank of Israel , which lowered borrowing costs
25 basis points to 2.5 percent on Jan. 23, is willing to make
further rate cuts if economic growth slows, Governor  Stanley
Fischer  said Jan. 26. About 40 percent of the nation’s economy
is based on exports, with  Europe  and the U.S. being the largest
markets.  The shekel weakened for a third day, declining 0.3 percent
to 3.7361 a dollar. The  Tel Aviv Bond 40 Index , which measures
inflation-linked and fixed-rate corporate bonds, was little
changed at 263.14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
