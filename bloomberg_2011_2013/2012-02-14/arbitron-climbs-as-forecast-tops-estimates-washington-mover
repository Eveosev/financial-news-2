Arbitron Inc. (ARB) , the provider of
audience ratings for U.S. radio stations, rose the most in a
month after forecasting sales that beat analystsâ€™ estimates.  The company advanced 5.1 percent to $37.21 at the close in
 New York , the biggest gain since Jan. 3. The shares have climbed
8.1 percent this year.  Revenue will increase 5 percent to 7 percent this year, the
company said today in a statement. That would be $443.4 million
to $451.9 million, and analysts had estimated $442 million on
average, according to a Bloomberg survey.  Arbitron is benefiting from price increases on its Portable
People Meter radio ratings services and gains in sales of
discretionary services. The company said it plans to buy back as
much as $100 million in stock.  Fourth-quarter profit excluding some items was 64 cents a
share, beating the average estimate of 56 cents, and Arbitron
said sales climbed to $120.1 million. That was in line with the
$119 million average estimate.  Earnings excluding some items will be $2.15 to $2.30 a
share in 2012, the company said in the statement. The average
estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg is $2.24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
