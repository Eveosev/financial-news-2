U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
will meet representatives of insurance companies today to
discuss ways to reduce the number of lawsuits, with the goal of
cutting car premiums.  The average cost of insuring a car rose 17 percent last
year to 410 pounds ($650), according to Cameron’s office. The
average premium for a young male driver is almost 3,000 pounds,
with young women paying just over half that. Insurers say much
of this is the result of record numbers of people suing for
whiplash injuries, which the  Association of British Insurers 
says adds 90 pounds to the average premium.  The government will pledge to cut the number of whiplash
claims by requiring more medical evidence. It will also reduce
the fees lawyers can earn from small personal injury claims. The
meeting will take place at 5 p.m. in Cameron’s London office.  “I am determined to tackle this damaging compensation
culture which has been pushing up premiums,” Cameron will say,
according to his office. “I want to stop trivial claims, free
up businesses from the stranglehold of health-and-safety red
tape and look at ways we can bring costs down.”  Lawmakers blamed insurers last month for “sharp
practices” including colluding with no-win no-fee lawyers and
car-rental firms to ramp up costs for rivals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
