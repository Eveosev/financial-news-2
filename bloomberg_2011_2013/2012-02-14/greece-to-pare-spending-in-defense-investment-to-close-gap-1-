Greece will make up a 325 million
euros ($427 million) gap in unaccounted for austerity measures
required for a second rescue package from cuts to defense,
public investment and local authorities, two government
officials said.  The spending cuts were decided at a Cabinet meeting in
 Athens  today and need to be approved by the so-called troika of
the European Commission, the  European Central Bank  and the
 International Monetary Fund , said the officials, who declined to
be identified. Cuts will also made in the health budget, one of
the officials said.  Talks between the Greek government and the troika over the
conditions for a 130 billion-euro financing package stalled last
week over disagreements over where to find 625 billion euros of
spending cuts. A meeting of euro area finance ministers on Feb.
9 said Greece would need to pass approve legislation through
Parliament on economic reforms and detail how it would find the
remaining savings before it could approve the rescue package.  Greece  decided last week before the troika talks broke up
that cuts to pensions would make up the other 300 million euros.
Cuts to pensions at state-owned companies and bank pensions will
equal 100 million euros, while another 200 million euros in
savings will come from cuts to auxiliary pensions, said another
government official, who also declined to be identified.  The details of the 300 million euros in pension cuts are
already approved by leaders of the parties backing the interim
government of Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos , the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
