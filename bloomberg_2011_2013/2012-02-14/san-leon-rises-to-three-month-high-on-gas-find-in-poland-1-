San Leon Energy Plc (SLE) , an oil and gas
explorer drilling shale rock, rose to the highest in almost
three months in London trading after a well in Poland found gas
across four intervals.  San Leon climbed 8.2 percent to 13.25 pence, the highest
since Nov. 16, valuing the Dublin-based company at 150.3 million
pounds ($236 million).  The Siciny-2 well “encountered more than 500 meters (1,640
feet) of potential reservoir for further analysis,” Chairman
Oisin Fanning said in a statement. “The complex nature of the
Carboniferous source rock, including natural fracturing, shows
real promise for gas production.”  San Leon gained 14 percent Feb. 10 after the Rogity-1 well,
operated by  Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM) , found liquids-rich shale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
