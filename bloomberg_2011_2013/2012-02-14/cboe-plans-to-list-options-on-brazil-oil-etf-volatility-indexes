(Corrects to say futures will start trading this month
after CBOE said its  SEC filing  was inaccurate.)  CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE) , owner of the
largest U.S. venue for equity derivatives, will list futures and
options tracking volatility indexes on Brazilian stocks and
crude oil, according to a statement on the exchangeâ€™s website.  Futures on the CBOE Brazil ETF Volatility Index and the
CBOE Crude Oil ETF Volatility Index will begin trading on Feb.
21, according to the  document . Options on the gauges, which
track the  iShares MSCI Brazil Index Fund (EWZ)  and the U.S. Oil Fund,
begin trading on March 6, said Gail Osten, a CBOE spokeswoman.  CBOE filed a document dated Feb. 10 with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission that erroneously said the
Brazil options would start trading in February, Osten said in a
telephone interview today.  The Chicago-based company on Jan. 30 listed  options  on the
CBOE Emerging Markets ETF Volatility Index, a gauge of prices
for contracts on the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund.  To contact the reporters on this story:
