Egypt ’s central bank sold 10.2
billion Egyptian pounds ($1.7 billion) of seven-day  repurchase
agreements  today, accepting all bids as it seeks to curb rising
borrowing costs.  The North African country’s regulator had made available
contracts valued at 12 billion pounds, according to central bank
data on Bloomberg. The agreements allow government security
holders to sell the notes back to the regulator to access funds
for a week at 9.75 percent.  Pressure on funds at local banks after the withdrawal of
foreign investors from the domestic  debt market  over the last
year has increased borrowing costs for the government and
hampered its ability to raise money. The central bank responded
last March by starting the repurchase facility.  The yield on Egypt’s 5.75 percent dollar bonds due in April
2020 declined for the first time in six days, losing 15 basis
points, or 0.15 of a percentage point, to 7.21 percent at 4:40
p.m. in Cairo, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The
pound was little changed at 6.0336 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
