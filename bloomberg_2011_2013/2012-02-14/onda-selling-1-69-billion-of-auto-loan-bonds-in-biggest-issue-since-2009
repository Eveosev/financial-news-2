Honda Motor Co. sold $1.69 billion
of bonds backed by auto loans in the carmaker’s largest issue of
the debt since July 2009, according to a person familiar with
the offering.  The sale was increased from $1.25 billion, said the person,
who declined to be identified because terms aren’t public. A
top-ranked portion maturing in 2.2 years yields 18 basis points
more than the benchmark swap rate.  Bond offerings connected to automobile sales are dominating
asset-backed sales this year. Deals linked to car and truck
sales account for $10 billion of the $18 billion in 2012 asset-
backed issuance, excluding Honda’s offering, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales of the securities may jump 11
percent to about $63 billion this year, accounting for about 55
percent of bonds tied to consumer borrowing, according to Wells
Fargo Securities LLC estimates.  The extra yield investors demand to own top-ranked bonds
backed by auto loans instead of Treasuries has declined 25 basis
points this year to 69 basis points and last week reached 67,
the lowest since Aug. 1, according to a Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Honda, based in  Tokyo , sold $1.83 billion of bonds backed
by auto loans in July 2009, Bloomberg data show.  Nissan Motor Co. is issuing $1 billion of asset-backed
securities similar to the debt issued by Honda, a person
familiar with that sale said. Ally Financial Inc. is offering
$750 million of so-called floor-plan bonds, which are linked to
payments from dealerships on inventory loans.  Ford Motor Co. last week sold $2.3 billion of floor-plan
debt in its largest offering of the securities since 2005,
Bloomberg data show. The sale was increased from $1 billion. The
top-ranked portion maturing in 1.92 years priced to yield 47
basis points more than the one-month London interbank offered
rate, or Libor, the rate at which banks say they can borrow in
dollars from each other.  To contact the reporter on this story:
