Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil company, is increasing production in the
South American country and the U.S. after output rose at the
slowest pace in four years in 2011.  Output in the so-called pre-salt region of Brazil’s
southeastern Campos Basin will increase by as much as 35,000
barrels a day this year as the company drills new wells, Rio de
Janeiro-based Petrobras said in a presentation today. The
company plans to start output at the Cascade-Chinook project in
the U.S. Gulf of  Mexico  in the first quarter, Chief Financial
Officer Almir Barbassa said.  Petrobras, the world’s biggest oil producer in waters
deeper than 300 meters (984 feet), plans to more than double
crude and natural-gas output by 2020 as it develops the largest
discoveries in the Americas in over three decades. It’s
investing $224.7 billion in the five years through 2015, the
biggest spending plan in the oil industry.  Output missed targets last year after suppliers delayed
equipment delivery and the oil spill at  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Macondo well in
2010 led Brazil’s petroleum regulator to increase safety
inspections. At the Cascade-Chinook project, tighter regulation
and faulty equipment that needed replacement have delayed output
by more than a year.  The oil producer said it will also increase output at five
offshore platforms it has installed in Brazil since late 2010 as
it connects new production wells.  Petrobras fell 1.8 percent to 23.93 reais at 1:03 p.m. in
 Sao Paulo . Before today, it rose 13 percent this year, less than
the 16 percent gain in the benchmark Bovespa index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
