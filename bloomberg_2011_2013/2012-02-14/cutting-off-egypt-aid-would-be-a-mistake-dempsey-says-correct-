The chairman of the U.S. Joint
Chiefs of Staff, U.S. Army General Martin Dempsey, urged
senators not to cut off aid to the Egyptian military in the
current “crisis” involving Americans working for pro-democracy
groups in  Egypt .  Dempsey, who visited Egypt Feb. 11, told the Senate Armed
Services Committee today that he has pressed top Egyptian
military officers “in the strongest possible terms” to resolve
the dispute over Egyptian moves to prosecute Americans and
others involved with non-governmental organizations in Egypt.  He said he left Egyptian military leaders, including Field
Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, the head of the interim ruling
council, with “no doubt” about the seriousness of the issue.  “I am convinced that potentially they were underestimating
the impact of this on our relationship,” Dempsey said. “When I
left there, there was no doubt that they understood the
seriousness of it.”  Dempsey cautioned lawmakers not to cut aid to Egypt, saying
such a move would be a “mistake.” The proposed federal budget
for the 2013 fiscal year, released yesterday, calls for $1.3
billion in assistance to the Egyptian military, $1.8 million in
military education and $250 million in economic assistance.  Dempsey was appearing before the committee to testify about
the 2013 defense authorization request. He made his comments on
Egypt in response to a question from Senator  John McCain  of
 Arizona , the panel’s top Republican.  To contact the reporter on this story:
