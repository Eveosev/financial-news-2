Sadara Chemical Co., a joint venture
between Saudi Arabian Oil Co. and  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) , is awarding
contracts for the construction of a petrochemical plant, said an
official with  KBR Inc. (KBR) , an adviser on the bidding.  KBR performed engineering and design work on the facility
to be built at Jubail, Saudi Arabia, said Khaled Abu-Nasrah, the
Houston-based company’s president for the  Middle East . KBR is
also the project management consultant for Sadara, he told a
conference today in Dubai.  Middle Eastern oil producers are expanding their capacity
to refine crude and produce petrochemicals, seeking to meet
domestic demand for fuels and make specialty chemicals that can
fetch higher prices on international markets. This expansion is
creating work for contractors, builders and engineers.  Saudi Aramco, as  Saudi Arabia ’s state oil producer is
known, is building three refineries and expanding into chemicals
output.  Iraq  is building four refineries, and Kuwait plans a
facility to process more than 600,000 barrels a day of oil.  Project management consultants typically advise clients on
tendering for works and on the evaluation of bids. KBR did
engineering work and serves as management consultant for Saudi
Aramco’s planned refinery at Jizan on the kingdom’s southern Red
Sea coast, Abu-Nasrah said.  In Iraq, KBR is working on refinery projects at Maysan and
Nasiriya and on the BP Plc-led Rumaila oilfield development,
Abu-Nasrah said. Kuwait may seek bids by the end of this year to
build a refinery, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
