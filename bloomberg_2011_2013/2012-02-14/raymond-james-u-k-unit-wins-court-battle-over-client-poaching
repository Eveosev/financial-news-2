Raymond James Financial Inc. (RJF) ’s U.K.
unit won a lawsuit in which financial advisory firm Towry
Holdings Ltd. accused the company and seven employees of taking
its clients.  A U.K. judge dismissed Towry’s claim, which sought as much
as 6 million pounds ($9.4 million), Faegre Baker Daniels LLP, a
 law firm  representing  Raymond James , said in an e-mailed
statement.  Towry sued for breach of contract after seven of its
financial advisers joined Raymond James’ U.K. unit and were
followed by some of their clients, the firm said. The case
highlights the importance of knowing which restrictions apply to
new recruits, and “taking time to ensure they are not
breached,” Faegre Baker Daniels partner Alex Denny said.  The seven employees had worked for a company taken over by
Towry in 2009 and were employed under different contracts to its
other staff, Andrew Fisher, Towry’s chief executive officer,
said in an e-mailed statement.  “We did not undertake this action lightly but to protect
our legitimate business interests for our clients and
shareholders,” Fisher said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
