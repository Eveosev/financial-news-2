Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.  fell
after reporting fourth-quarter profit that was less than
analystsâ€™ estimates as the number of tires sold declined 5
percent.  Goodyear dropped 7.6 percent to $12.91 at 10:43 a.m. New
York time. The shares had fallen 1.4 percent this year before
today after gaining 20 percent in 2011.  Fourth-quarter profit excluding some items was 3 cents a
share, the Akron, Ohio-based company said in a statement. That
trailed the 21-cent average of seven analyst estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. The drop in volume of tires sold reduced revenue
by $174 million, Goodyear said.  Sales rose 12 percent to $5.68 billion in the quarter as
higher selling prices boosted revenue per tire 19 percent. The
average of five analyst estimates was for $5.88 billion. Net
income was $25 million, or 7 cents, compared with a loss of $177
million, or 73 cents a year earlier, the company said.  Tire sales this year will be about the same as in 2011, as
raw material prices rise 5 percent, Goodyear said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
