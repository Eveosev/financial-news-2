South Korea ’s won declined and bonds
advanced after Moody’s Investors Service cut the debt ratings of
six European countries including Italy, Spain and  Portugal ,
sapping demand for riskier assets.  The uncertainty over the euro area’s prospects for changing
its fiscal and economic framework is among the main drivers of
the action, the ratings company said yesterday. Euro-area
finance chiefs will convene in Brussels tomorrow to decide
whether to ratify a 130 billion-euro ($171 billion) rescue
package for  Greece .  “Negative news from  Europe  is putting downward pressure on
the won,” said Yu Won Jun, a Seoul-based currency dealer at
Korea Exchange Bank. “Still, exporters are waiting to sell the
dollar as the won weakens, and this will limit won declines.”  The won slid 0.2 percent to 1,123.78 per dollar at its
close in  Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
weakened to as low as 1,125.95 earlier.  South Korea’s  unemployment rate  probably rose to 3.2
percent in January from a three-year low of 3.1 percent in the
previous three months, according to a survey of economists by
Bloomberg News. Official data is due tomorrow.  The yield on South Korea’s 3.25 percent bonds due December
2014 declined two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
3.44 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. Three-year
futures advanced 0.05 percent to 104.22. The one-year interest
swap rate fell two basis points to 3.48 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
