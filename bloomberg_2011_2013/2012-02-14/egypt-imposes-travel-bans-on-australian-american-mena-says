Egyptian prosecutors today imposed
travel bans on a U.S. and an Australian citizen following
allegations that they bribed people to stage a strike, the
state-run Middle East News Agency reported.  Prosecutors released the two yesterday and imposed the
travel ban pending further investigation, the Cairo-based agency
said. Investigations show that the Australian, who works as a
journalist, entered the country on a tourist and not a work
visa, MENA reported. The U.S. citizen is a student, it said.  They are accused of bribing people in the Nile Delta town
of Al-Mahala El-Kobra, MENA said.  In a separate case that has strained ties between the U.S.
and  Egypt  and jeopardized American financial aid to the Egyptian
military, Egypt has referred 43 people, including the son of
U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, to trial as part of a
probe into foreign funding of non-governmental agencies. The
ruling military council, which has come under increased pressure
to cede power to civilians, has accused “foreign hands” of
fomenting unrest in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
