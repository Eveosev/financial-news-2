(Corrects spelling of  China  in headline.)  Copper  imports  by China, the largest
user, may remain robust in coming months as traders build
stockpiles closer to consumers to cash in on arbitrage
opportunities, said Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.  Merchants have been increasing inventories at exchange and
bonded warehouses to quickly benefit from arbitrage windows
between Shanghai and  London , which close quickly, and to meet
the growing tendency for consumers to live hand-to-mouth, said
Nick Trevethan, the bank’s senior commodities strategist in
Singapore.  An increase in copper imports may fuel the metal’s 11
percent gain this year in London, after shipments declined for
the first time in eight months in January from a record the
previous month.  Inventories (SHFCCOPD)  monitored by the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose last week to the highest ever.  “China’s imports may continue at comparatively high levels
for next few months, even if there’s very little financial
motivation in terms of a profitable arbitrage window right
now,” said Trevethan.  China’s imports of the refined metal, copper alloy and
products dropped to 413,964 metric tons in January, the customs
agency said Feb. 10. This compares with a record 508,942 tons in
December.  Inventories monitored by the Shanghai bourse jumped by more
than threefold to 198,202 tons from a 27-month low of 57,655
tons on Dec. 1, bourse data showed Feb. 10.  London Metal Exchange stockpiles fell 19 percent to 313,500
tons in the same period, exchange data showed. LME stockpiles
touched a 29-month low of 312,750 tons on Feb. 10. Stockpiles in
 Asia  shrank 60 percent to 24,475 tons during the period.  Copper for three-month delivery dropped 0.4 percent to
$8,395.50 a ton on the LME at 3:04 p.m. in  Tokyo .  Destocking Cycle  Stockpiles within China may not be large enough to allow a
long destocking cycle, Morgan Stanley said in a Feb. 8 note. The
bank estimated stockpiles at bonded warehouses in China at near
350,000 tons, compared with 750,000 tons in early 2011.  About 300,000 tons of copper was probably added to bonded
warehouses and merchant inventory in China in the fourth quarter
and stockpiles likely continued to expand this year,  Barclays
Capital  said in a Feb. 7 report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
