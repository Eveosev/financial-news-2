The amount of Ukraine’s winter
grain, mostly wheat, in poor condition rose by 1 percent to 2.4
million hectares (5.9 million acres) as of Feb. 9, compared with
a week earlier, researcher UkrAgroConsult said.  The amount of grain in good condition fell by 1.3 percent
to 1.84 million hectares, UkrAgroConsult said in an e-mailed
statement today, citing information from the  Agriculture
Ministry .  Farmers will need to replant half of the country’s winter
grains, or 3.5 million hectares, due to severe frosts, Prime
Minister  Mykola Azarov  said last week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
