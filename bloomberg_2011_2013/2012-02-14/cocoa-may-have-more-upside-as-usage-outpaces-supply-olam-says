Cocoa prices, which fell the most in
12 years in 2011, may have ‘more upside,’ with demand
outstripping supply this season, according to Singapore-based
raw materials trader  Olam International Ltd. (OLAM)   Cocoa fell 32 percent in London last year, the biggest
annual drop since 1999, after global production was 341,000
metric tons higher than consumption in the 2010-11 season, data
from the London-based International Cocoa Organization show. A
deficit of 100,000 tons is forecast for the 2011-12 crop year
that started in October, Gerry Manley, managing director and
global head for cocoa at Olam, said on Dec. 12.  “Where we’ve had a surplus in the last marketing year,
2010-2011, we expect a deficit in 2011-2012,” Sunny Verghese,
the company’s chief executive officer, said on a conference call
about the company’s earnings today. “There’ll be a little bit
more upside to cocoa prices going forward.”  Cocoa prices have climbed 6.9 percent on the NYSE Liffe
exchange in  London  this year on speculation dry weather in West
Africa will damage the mid-crop, the smaller of two annual
harvests that usually starts in April.  Ivory Coast  and  Ghana ,
the two biggest growers, accounted for 58 percent of global
production in 2010-11, according to ICCO data.  The mid-crop in Ivory Coast, the world’s biggest producer,
may fall to 310,000 tons in 2011-12 from 448,000 tons in the
previous season, London-based broker Marex Spectron estimated on
Feb. 3.  Cocoa processing grew by about 5 percent in 2011,
“slightly higher than what people have factored in,” Verghese
said on the call. Grindings, an indication of demand, have been
“very strong, stronger than expected.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
