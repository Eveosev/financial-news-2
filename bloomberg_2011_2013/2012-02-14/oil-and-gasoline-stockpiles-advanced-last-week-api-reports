Crude oil inventories rose 2.9
million barrels to 337.8 last week, the  American Petroleum
Institute  said.  Gasoline stockpiles  rose 1.81 million barrels to 230.7
million, the APIâ€™s weekly report showed.  Distillate fuel
inventories  fell 2.16 million barrels to 142.1 million.  Inventories at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, rose 1.98
million to 32.5 million.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its inventory
report at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington .  The government report may show stockpiles of crude oil rose
1.6 million barrels last week, according to the median of 12
responses in a  Bloomberg News (DOEASCRD)  survey of analysts. Gasoline
inventories probably gained 775,000 barrels, the survey showed.
Distillates were expected to slip by 1.1 million barrels.  API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  Crude oil for March delivery rose 3 cents to $100.94 a
barrel at 4:31 p.m. in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The contract, which settled at $100.74,
traded at $101.17 before the report was released at 4:30 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
