Cattle futures rose to the highest
in almost three weeks on signs that fewer animals are available
for U.S. slaughterhouses amid robust demand for beef. Hogs also
gained, and feeder cattle climbed to a record.  An estimated 3.6 million cattle have been processed this
year through Feb. 11, down 5.4 percent from 2011, government
data show. The number of animals being offered for sale by
feedlots to meatpackers is  “surprisingly low,” said  Lane Broadbent  at KIS Futures Inc. Wholesale-beef prices are up 3.4
percent since touching a four-month low on Jan. 19.  “Packers are having to buy cattle on the sellers’ terms,”
Broadbent, a vice president, said in a telephone interview from
 Oklahoma City . “Demand is still very good overseas and very
solid domestically. You get increasing demand and tighter
supplies, and that will mean higher-priced cattle.”  Cattle futures for April delivery advanced 0.9 percent to
close at $1.2925 a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, after reaching $1.2945, the highest for a most-active
contract since Jan. 25, when the commodity jumped to a record
$1.29675. Prices have gained 6.4 percent this year and almost 14
percent from a year ago.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement increased 1
percent to $1.5625 a pound in  Chicago , after reaching a record
$1.568.  Wholesale beef rose to $1.8769 at midday today, the highest
since Jan. 11, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  Exports 
of the meat totaled 2.8 billion pounds (1.3 million metric tons)
last year, up 21 percent from a year earlier, according to the
USDA.  Canada ,  Mexico  and  Japan  were the biggest buyers.  Hog futures for April settlement gained 1.9 percent to
settle at 89.625 cents a pound in Chicago. Prices are up 6.3
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
