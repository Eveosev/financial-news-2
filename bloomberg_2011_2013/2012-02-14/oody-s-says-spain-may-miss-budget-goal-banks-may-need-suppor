Moody’s Investors Service said it is
“skeptical”  Spain ’s two-month old government can meet its
budget targets and it expects banks may need additional public
support.  Moody’s cut Spain’s credit rating to A3 from A1, as it also
downgraded five other European nations. Spain may fail to cut
the  budget deficit  to 4.4 percent of gross domestic product this
year from 8 percent last year, pushing the debt burden to 75
percent of GDP at year-end, the company said.  “Moody’s is skeptical that the target can be achieved and
expects the general government budget deficit to remain between
5.5 percent and 6 percent,” it said in a statement yesterday
from  London .  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  is trying to rein in the
 deficit  that overshot its target last year as the economy headed
back into its second recession in as many years. The government,
in power since Dec. 21, is also pushing banks to recognize
deeper real-estate losses and has offered to buy bonds that can
convert into equity from struggling lenders.  Spain’s economy  may shrink as much as 1.5 percent this
year, hurting banks’ profitability just as the government is
pushing them to increase provisions, Moody’s said. It is
“doubtful” the government’s plan to encourage bank mergers
will work without more public support, it said.  “Contingent risks arising from the banking sector are
higher and more likely to crystallize in the case of Spain than
among many of its peers,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
