Canadian natural gas rose, tracking
an advance in New York futures, amid forecasts of colder weather
in the western U.S. and as power companies closed nuclear plants
for maintenance.  Alberta  gas rose 3.2 percent. Demand for heat in the U.S.
Southwest will exceed normal by 16 percent through Feb. 21, said
Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives. U.S. nuclear
generation dropped to 88 percent of capacity, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A decrease in nuclear availability may
boost the use of gas-fired generators.  “Nukes are falling off a bit,” said  Kyle Cooper , director
of research at IAF Advisors in Houston. “If we get over the
unplanned issues, the nuclear maintenance schedule looks pretty
light this year.”  Alberta gas for March delivery gained 6.6 cents to C$2.095
a gigajoule ($1.99 per million British thermal units) at 2:55
p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market. NGX gas
has lost 27 percent this year.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for March delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose 10.1 cents, or 4.2 percent, to settle at $2.532
per million Btu.  Spot Prices  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago rose
5.64 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $2.6869 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance, an express line, can carry
1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas rose 0.65 cent to $2.4631. At Malin,  Oregon , where
Canadian gas is traded for California markets, gas advanced 3.09
cents to $2.5933.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.7 billion cubic
feet, 138 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.41 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.12 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 561 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.88 billion cubic feet today, or 77 percent of its
capacity of 2.44 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.94
billion cubic feet at 1:50 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
