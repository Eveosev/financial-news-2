Falling prices for  lithium-ion
batteries  will make power-storage systems competitive with
natural gas as a source of electricity during periods of high
demand by 2016, according to the chief executive officer of  A123
Systems Inc. (AONE)   “In general, batteries will come down by about half in
price from 2010 to 2015,” David Vieau said yesterday in a
telephone interview. Waltham, Massachusetts-based A123 has
shipped more than 90 megawatts of battery systems that utilities
use instead of gas-fired peaker plants.  Utilities currently use gas-fired plants to supply power to
meet short periods of peak demand, sometimes only a few hours a
year. A123 makes battery systems that store power and supply it
when needed. Improvements in battery chemistry and manufacturing
will drive down prices and make them last longer, making them a
viable replacement for gas, Vieau said.  “The challenge is to demonstrate that they last 10 to 20
years,” making them comparable with existing power-generation
plants, he said.  Utilities owned by  AES Corp. (AES) , Sempra Energy and  Edison
International (EIX)  use A123’s storage systems, which provide within
milliseconds anywhere from 10 kilowatts to 500 megawatts of
power, for as long as eight hours.  Battery technology must come down in cost to be considered
a viable alternative, Amir Rozwadowski, an analyst at Barclays
Capital Inc. in New York said today in a phone interview. “The
question facing the company is can they get pricing down to
generate an attractive enough return.”  Electric Vehicles  Sales of grid-power systems made up 32 percent of A123’s
third-quarter revenue. Its transport business, including
batteries for electric cars, buses and commercial vehicles, made
up 54 percent.  The grid business now makes up 40 percent to 50 percent of
A123’s sales, Vieau said. “The company has focused a lot on
grid and commercial businesses and yet we are labeled as an
electric-vehicle company.”  The company fell the most in two years on Feb. 9 after its
largest customer, electric-car maker Fisker Automotive Inc.,
stopped work on a factory. The company also supplies batteries
to General Motors Co. and Daimler AG.  The shares rose 0.2 percent to $2.14 at the close today in
 New York . They have dropped 78 percent in the past year.  The company had $97.3 million in  revenue  in 2010. Analysts
expect 2011 revenue to reach $167.7, the average of 11 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  “On the grid, I think there is a good opportunity,” Vieau
said. “We have more lithium-ion battery grid energy storage
systems installed than any other company on the planet.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
