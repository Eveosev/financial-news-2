President Narayana Kocherlakota forecast that U.S. gross
domestic product will grow at a 2.5 percent to 3 percent rate
this year and next.  “Given my forecast of moderate GDP growth, I expect the
 unemployment rate  to continue to fall slowly,” Kocherlakota
said in a statement to local media posted on the Minneapolis
Fed’s website today.  Kocherlakota predicted  joblessness  will fall to about 7.7
percent by the fourth quarter of this year and to about 7
percent by the end of 2013. The rate declined to 8.3 percent in
January, the lowest since February 2009.  Inflation will be about 2 percent this year and climb to
2.3 percent in 2013 “as monetary policy remains highly
accommodative,” Kocherlakota said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
