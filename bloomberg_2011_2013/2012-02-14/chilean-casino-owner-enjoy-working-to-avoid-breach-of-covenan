Enjoy SA (ENJOY) , a Santiago-based casino
owner, ended last year with a higher debt ratio than allowed for
by the covenants on its bonds and has 90 working days to get
back in line, the company said in its earnings statement.  Should Enjoy not come back into line with its covenants
within that time, the bondholders have the right to force
accelerated payment of the 110 billion peso ($228 million) debt,
the company said in a  statement  published on its website.  The covenants on the bonds obliged Enjoy to keep its level
of net debt at less than five times its earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization at the end of 2011.
As of Dec. 31 the ratio was at 5.66 times. Enjoy expects to meet
its obligation in the time remaining, it said.  The company needs to reduce that ratio to four times the
measure of earnings beginning 2013, according to the statement,
which was published Feb. 9. Newspaper Diario Financiero reported
on the covenants today.  Telephone calls to the company’s corporate finance team,
led by Rodrigo Larrain, went unanswered today.  The yield on Enjoy’s bonds due June 2015 fell four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 8.65 percent as of 11:21
a.m. in Santiago, according to data from the Santiago stock
exchange. The security last traded on Feb. 8.  Enjoy owns and runs seven casinos in  Chile  and operates one
in  Argentina .  To contact the reporter on this story:
