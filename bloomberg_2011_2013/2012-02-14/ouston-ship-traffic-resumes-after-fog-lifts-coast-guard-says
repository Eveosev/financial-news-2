Maritime pilots resumed guiding
vessels through the  Houston Ship Channel  after a three-hour
delay when fog reduced visibility at the largest U.S. petroleum
port, the Coast Guard said.  Pilots resumed transits to Houston at 7:45 a.m. local time
today after halting operations at 4:45 a.m., Albert Hernandez, a
Coast Guard watch supervisor in Houston, said in an interview.  The suspension left eight deep-draft vessels waiting for
passage to Houston and nine ships in the port as of 6 a.m. local
time, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
