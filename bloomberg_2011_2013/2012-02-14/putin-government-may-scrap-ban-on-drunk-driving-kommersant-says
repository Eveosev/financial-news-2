Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin ’s
government may scrap Russia’s zero-tolerance policy for drinking
and driving,  Kommersant  reported.  The authorities may restore the limit of 0.3 grams of
alcohol per liter in a driver’s blood that was in effect before
July 2008, the Moscow-based newspaper said, citing unidentified
officials. President  Dmitry Medvedev  lifted the rule from August
2010.  Drunk driving accidents caused more than 8,000 accidents
that killed 1,347 people in the first eight months of last year
after Medvedev reintroduced the ban, according to Kommersant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
