Serbiaâ€™s foreign-currency reserves
fell 3.8 percent to 11.6 billion euros ($15.3 billion) in
January amid stepped-up external debt servicing, while banks
reduced funds they set aside in mandatory reserves, the central
bank said.  Net reserves, excluding the funds commercial lenders keep
with the central bank and funds from the  International Monetary
Fund , rose to 6.7 billion euros from 6.66 billion euros in
December, the National Bank of Serbia said today in an e-mail.
This equaled 447 percent of M1 money supply, up from 430 percent
in the previous month and remained sufficient for about eight
months of imports.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije did not detail debt
repayments and other foreign-currency outflows for January.  Interbank trading volumes of 1.819 billion euros were 281
million euros lower than in December, the bank said, adding that
the dinar weakened 1.3 percent against the euro in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
