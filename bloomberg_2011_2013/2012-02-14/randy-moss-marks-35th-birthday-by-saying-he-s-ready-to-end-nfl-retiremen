Randy Moss  celebrated his 35th
birthday by announcing he wants to end his six-month retirement
from the  National Football League .  “I wanna play football,” former wide receiver Moss, a
six-time Pro Bowl selection who is tied with Terrell Owens for
second on the NFL career list with 153 touchdown catches, said
on a web chat yesterday.  “Your boy is going to come back here and play some
football,” Moss said in a UStream.TV video chat. “I had some
things I had to adjust in my life.”  Moss retired Aug. 1 after 13 NFL seasons with the Minnesota
Vikings, Oakland Raiders, New England Patriots and Tennessee
Titans. He had 14,858 yards receiving, fifth on the NFL career
list, and was ninth with 954 receptions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
