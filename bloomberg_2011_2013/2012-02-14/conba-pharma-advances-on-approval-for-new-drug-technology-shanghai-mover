Zhejiang Conba Pharmaceutical Co. (600572) 
shares rose the most in more than eight months after the Chinese
government approved its extraction technology used in making
drugs for cardiovascular disease.  The stock jumped 7.2 percent to 8.79 yuan at the close in
Shanghai, the biggest advance since May 31. The benchmark
 Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  decreased 0.3 percent.  Conba, based in the eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang,
received government approval for the technology used in
producing a brand of ginkgo leaf capsules, according to a
statement to Shanghai’s stock exchange. The company will also
receive a 1.96 million yuan ($311,000) subsidy for the project
from the government, the statement showed.  “This is good news to the company and will surely help
improve its competitiveness and boost its herbal medicine
sales,” Liu Yaming, an analyst at Founder Securities Co., said
in a phone interview in Shanghai. Liu has a “buy” rating on
the stock.  Cardiovascular disease is the biggest killer in  China ,
accounting for 38 percent of deaths, according to the  World
Health Organization .  Conba, which competes with  Kunming Pharmaceutical Corp. (600422) ,
probably sold 50 percent more ginkgo leaf tablets with sales of
100 million yuan in 2011 from a year earlier, Founder
Securities’ Liu said.  Kunming Pharmaceutical fell for the first time in five
days, losing 1.5 percent to 13.95 yuan in Shanghai. The shares
have dropped 6.1 percent this year, compared with a 24 percent
rally in Conba.  --Jiang Jianguo. Editor: Bloomberg News, Linus Chua  To contact the reporter on this story:
