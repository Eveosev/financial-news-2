Pegatron Corp. (4938) , a maker of  Apple
Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhones, said it has been informed of pending inspections
of factory work conditions by a labor group.  Pegatron’s Shanghai factory was told about the coming
inspection within the last two days and hasn’t been given a
schedule for the visit, Charles Lin, chief financial officer of
the Taipei-based company, said by telephone today. Earlier, Lin
had said the company wasn’t informed about the inspections.  Apple said the Washington-based Fair Labor Association
began checks of working conditions at supplier Foxconn
Technology Group yesterday, about a month after the iPhone maker
became the first technology company to join the association.
Audits at Pegatron and  Quanta Computer Inc. (2382)  are scheduled to
start this spring, Cupertino, California-based Apple said in a
statement.  The labor association’s members include Nike Inc. and
Nestle SA.  Carol Hsu, a spokeswoman for Taoyuan, Taiwan-based Quanta,
a maker of iPods and notebooks for Apple, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
