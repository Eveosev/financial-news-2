Freddie Solomon, who played on the
San Francisco 49ers’ first two Super Bowl-winning teams, died
yesterday from colon and liver cancer. He was 59.  Drafted by the  Miami Dolphins  in 1975, Solomon was traded
to the 49ers three years later. He won the  Super Bowl  after the
1981 and 1984 seasons, and in 1983 set a 49ers record that still
stands by averaging 21.4 yards per catch.  “Freddie and I have been friends for 35 years and he was
one of the most gentle and best men I’ve ever met in my life,”
former 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. said in a statement on
the team’s website last night. “I’ve never met a man who cared
so much about the human race.”  In eight seasons with the 49ers, Solomon had 310 receptions
for 4,873 yards and 43 touchdowns and also rushed for 329 yards
and three touchdowns. He retired from the  National Football
League  after the 1985 season with 371 career receptions for
5,846 yards and 48 touchdowns.  “I’ll miss him terribly, he was a great friend,” former
San Francisco wide receiver Dwight Clark said in a statement on
the team’s website. “He taught me how to be an NFL player. He
was very unselfish with teaching me all the things I needed to
know to play in the NFL.”  After retiring, Solomon worked for 20 years in community
relations with the sheriff’s office in Hillsborough County,
 Florida , the 49ers website said.  Solomon is survived by his wife of 33 years, Dee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
