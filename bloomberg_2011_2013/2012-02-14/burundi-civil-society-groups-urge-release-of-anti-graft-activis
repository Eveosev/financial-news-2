Ten Burundian civil-society groups
urged the government to free an anti-corruption activist
arrested after saying that some of the country’s magistrates
obtained their posts by bribing Justice Ministry officials.  Faustin Ndikumana was jailed on Feb. 7 after sending a
letter to the ministry calling for an end to bribery, Gabriel Rufyiri, president of the Anti-Corruption and Economic
Malpractice Observatory, told reporters today in Bujumbura, the
capital. Ndikumana is head of the Words and Action for the
Awakening of Conscience and the Evolution of Mindsets group.  “We are here to launch a campaign to call on the government
to release him and urge our government to be more transparent in
recruitment,” Rufyiri said.  Amnesty International , the London-based advocacy group,
said Ndikumana has been charged with making “ false declarations ”
under Burundi’s anti-corruption laws and faces as long as 10
years in prison and a fine of as much as 1 million Burundian
francs ($716).  To contact the reporter on this story:
