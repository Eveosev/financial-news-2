Kenya , the largest East African
economy, cut the maximum prices of gasoline,  diesel fuel  and
kerosene after the shilling strengthened against the dollar.  So-called super petrol, the most commonly used gasoline
grade, fell 0.6 percent to 111.32 shillings ($1.34) a liter (0.3
gallons) in the capital, Nairobi, the Energy Regulatory
Commission said in an e-mailed statement today.  Diesel prices decreased by 2.61 shillings per litre to 105.
29 shillings while that of kerosene, a fuel used for cooking and
lighting, fell 3.37 shillings to 83.74 shillings, the
commission’s director-general, Kaburu Mwirichia, said in the
statement.  “Recently the local currency has remained stable over the
review period relative to the U.S. dollar and this has impacted
positively on the local pump price,” Mwirichia said.  Since the last price review on Jan. 14, the Kenyan currency
has strengthened 4.9 percent to 82.65 against the  U.S. dollar ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
