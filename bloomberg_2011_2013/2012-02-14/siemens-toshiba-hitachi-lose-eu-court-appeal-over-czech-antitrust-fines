Siemens AG (SIE) ,  Toshiba Corp. (6502) ,  Hitachi
Ltd. (6501)  are among electric-equipment makers that lost a European
Court challenge to overturn more than 900 million koruna ($47
million) in Czech antitrust fines.  The  EU Court of Justice  ruled that the Czech antitrust
regulator was right to fine at least 10 companies a record 979
million koruna in 2007, a month after the EU authority had
levied a 750.7 million-euro penalty ($988 million) on them for
colluding on prices of electric equipment. The companies, also
including  Areva SA (CEI)  and  Alstom SA (ALO) , challenged the legality of the
Czech fine, which was later cut to 942 million koruna.  A Czech regional court in 2008 overturned the national
penalty, ruling that the companies couldnâ€™t be fined twice, once
by the European Commission and once by Czech regulator. On
appeal by the Czech antitrust watchdog, a high court in 2009
annulled that ruling and said the regional court had to re-
examine the case.  The regional court referred the case to the EU tribunal
questioning whether EU or Czech law applied for the period
during which the cartel took place in the  Czech Republic  before
the country became part of the 27-nation bloc in May 2004.  The case is: C-17/10, Toshiba Corporation, Areva,
 Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503) , Alstom, Fuji Electric, VA TECH
Transmission & Distribution GmbH & Co. KEG,  Siemens AG (SIE) , Hitachi
