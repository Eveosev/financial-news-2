Pittsburgh Steelers running back
Rashard Mendenhall might not be ready to play in the 2012
National Football League season after tearing a knee ligament in
the team’s final regular-season game in January, General Manager
Kevin Colbert said on the team’s website.  Colbert said he typically expects players with Mendenhall’s
injury, a torn anterior cruciate ligament, to miss a full year.
Mendenhall was injured in a game against the  Cleveland Browns  on
Jan. 1.  Mendenhall, 24, was the Steelers’ leading rusher for the
past three seasons.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
