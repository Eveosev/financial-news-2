Chicago  gasoline weakened to a
record low level with regional inventories at a 23-month high,
even as a surge in the price of crude oil from North Dakota and
Canada used by Midwest refiners may cause production to decline.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
 Chicago (CHCG87PC)  widened 2 cents to 52 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:36 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Itâ€™s the lowest level
since at least 1996. Prompt delivery slipped 4.98 cents to
$2.4627 a gallon.  Syncrude oil surged the most on record against West Texas
Intermediate after  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ)  said its
Horizon oil sands upgrader may be out of service until late
March. Western Canadian Select and Bakken oil from  North Dakota 
also strengthened.  Canadian oils used by Midwest refiners have been at record
discounts to West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude,
increasing profits from producing fuel. Gasoline inventories in
the Midwest rose to the highest level since March 2010, the
Energy Department reported Feb. 8.  Canadian Natural cut its Horizon production forecast for
the year to 93,000 to 100,000 barrels a day, from 105,000 to
115,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
