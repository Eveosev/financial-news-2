Russian stocks swung between gains
and losses as concern about the European debt crisis sent the
price of crude oil lower.  The 30-stock  Micex (INDEXCF)  was up less than 0.1 percent to 1,560.62
by 12:18 p.m. in Moscow, having earlier dropped as much as 0.4
percent. The gauge advanced 2.3 percent yesterday, the most
since Jan. 3.  OAO Inter RAO UES (IRAO) ,  Russia ’s state-controlled power
generator and exporter, fell 1.1 percent. The dollar-denominated
RTS Index fell 0.6 percent to 1,636.36.  Oil, Russia’s main export revenue earner, retreated from a
five-week high, falling as much as 54 cents to $100.37 a barrel
in  New York  after Moody’s Investors Service cut the debt ratings
of six European countries and revised its outlook to
“negative” for the U.K. and  France . The European Union is
Russia’s biggest trading partner.  OAO Sberbank (SBER) , Russia’s biggest lender, fell 0.5 percent to
95.73 rubles, retreating from its highest closing level since
Aug. 4, as the ruble depreciated 0.6 percent to 30.08 against
the dollar.  The Micex is up 11 percent this year and trades at 6 times
analysts’ earnings estimates for member companies.  Brazil ’s
Bovespa index, which is valued at 10.6 times estimated earnings,
has climbed 16 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The Shanghai Composite Index trades at 9.6 times estimated
earnings, and the BSE India Sensitive Index has a ratio of 15.9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
