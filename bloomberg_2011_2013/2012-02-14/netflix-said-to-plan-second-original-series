Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , ratcheting up
competition with HBO, will produce 13 episodes of a new comedy
series, “Orange is the New Black,” according to a person with
knowledge of the situation.  The online movie and TV service, based in Los Gatos,
 California , will have first rights to the series from the
creator of “Weeds,” said the person, who wasn’t authorized to
speak before the deal is announced. The show is based on the
memoir of a communications executive who served time for drug-
related charges in a minimum security women’s prison.  The comedy from “Weeds” creator Jenji Kohan is the second
original series bankrolled by Netflix, which is positioning
itself as a rival to  Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s HBO. The company also
backed the Kevin Spacey drama “House of Cards” that airs this
year. Chief Executive Officer  Reed Hastings  in December
described HBO GO, the online offshoot of the cable network, as
“the competitor we fear most.”  Netflix has also has picked up exclusive distribution
rights to series produced by others. The Norwegian drama
“Lilyhammer” is now available, and new episodes of “Arrested
Development” are scheduled for 2013. “Weeds,” airing on CBS
Corp.’s Showtime, is about a suburban mom who becomes a
marijuana dealer.  Netflix gained 3.9 percent to $122.88 at 1:10 p.m. New York
time. The stock had gained 71 percent this year before today
after declining 61 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
