Peruvian dollar bonds rose, pushing
down yields to a three-month low, as a surge in German investor
confidence bolstered the outlook for  Europe ’s largest economy
and boosted demand for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The yield on the Peru’s benchmark 6.55 percent dollar-
denominated bond due March 2037 fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 4.71 percent at 1:23 p.m. in Lima, the
lowest since Nov. 16. The bond’s price rose 0.35 cent to 126.97
cents per dollar.  German investor confidence surged to a 10-month high as
global growth picked up and Europe’s debt crisis showed signs of
abating. Reduced  risk aversion  and investors’ hunt for yield
spurred demand for Peru’s foreign-currency debt, said Manuel Aldave, head of investments at Banco Internacional del Peru.  “Investors are desperate for carry,” Aldave said, in
reference to the practice of borrowing funds from low-interest-
rate countries to buy assets in higher-yielding nations.  Peru’s sol fell 0.1 percent to 2.6865 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.6850 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
