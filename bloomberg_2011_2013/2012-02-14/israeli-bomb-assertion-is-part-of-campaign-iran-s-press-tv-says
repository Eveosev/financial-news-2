Iran  rejected accusations by  Israel 
that it was behind car-bomb attacks on Israeli diplomatic
targets yesterday, saying the allegations are part of a campaign
against it,  Press TV  reported.  “We categorically reject the accusations made by the
Zionist regime,” Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ramin
Mehmanparast said, according to a report published on the state-
run news channel’s website today. “They are part of a
propaganda war,” by Israel, he added.  Israel “has a serious record of criminal actions against
humanity, and it is the first suspect of any terrorist operation
in the world,” Mehmanparast said. Iran condemns all terrorist
acts, Press TV quoted him as saying late yesterday.  An Israeli embassy vehicle in  New Delhi  was bombed,
injuring a diplomat’s wife and her Indian driver, Indian Foreign
Ministry spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said in a text message. In
Tbilisi, an Israeli embassy employee discovered a bomb and
reported it to police, who defused it, Shota Utiashvili,
spokesman for the Georgian Interior Ministry, said by phone,
adding that there were no injuries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
