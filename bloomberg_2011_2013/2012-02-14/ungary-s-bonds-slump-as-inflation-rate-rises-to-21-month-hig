Hungary’s government bonds weakened
after the country’s inflation rate jumped to the highest in 21
months in January.  The slump in the notes maturing in 2014 raised yields 9
basis points, or 0.09 percentage points, to 8.432 percent by 5
p.m. in Budapest. Consumer prices rose 5.5 percent from a year
earlier, the most since April 2010, after a 4.1 percent increase
in December, the statistics office in Budapest said today. The
median estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News was 5
percent.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank unexpectedly held the benchmark
 interest rate  at 7 percent last month. President  Andras Simor 
said the vote was “close” and that the main rate may need to
be lifted further if the country’s risk assessment and inflation
outlook deteriorate.  “Monetary policy statements will reconfirm the Monetary
Council’s readiness to hike rates further if inflation trends
continue to accelerate,”  Eszter Gargyan , a Budapest-based
economist at Citigroup Inc., wrote in an e-mailed report on the
inflation data. “But risk premiums are likely to remain the key
inputs to rate decisions in the short term.”  The forint depreciated 0.2 percent to 291.15 per euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
