Boeing Co. (BA)  said it will deliver the
first passenger version of its 747-8, the biggest jumbo jet it’s
ever built, to an unidentified VIP customer on Feb. 28.  A delivery ceremony has been scheduled for that day near
Boeing’s wide-body-jet plant in Everett,  Washington , the
Chicago-based company said in an e-mail today.  The 747-8 freighter entered service in late 2011, two years
behind schedule. Germany’s Deutsche Lufthansa AG is due to
receive the first model intended for commercial passenger
service early this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
