Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ)  and Bats
Global Markets Inc., two of the three biggest operators of U.S.
stock exchanges, said access to their websites was disrupted by
attacks that flooded their systems with traffic.  Both companies said their trading systems were unaffected.
Joseph Christinat, a spokesman for New York-based Nasdaq OMX,
and Stacie Fleming of Lenexa, Kansas-based Bats confirmed the
outages. For Nasdaq, its main Web page as well as
nasdaqtrader.com, a market information site, were disrupted.  NYSE Euronext (NYX) , owner of the New York Stock Exchange, didn’t
experience an outage, according to  Richard Adamonis , a
spokesman. Nor did Direct Edge Holdings Inc., the fourth-largest
U.S. exchange owner, said Jim Gorman, a spokesman.  Nasdaq OMX disclosed an intrusion last year involving
“suspicious” files on its Directors Desk system, which lets
corporate board members communicate and share information. The
National Security Agency, the top U.S. electronic intelligence
service, joined a probe of the 2010 attack, people familiar with
the investigation said in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
