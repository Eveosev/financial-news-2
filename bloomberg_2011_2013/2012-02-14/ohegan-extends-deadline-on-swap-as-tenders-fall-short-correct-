Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority, the
operator of Mohegan Sun casinos in  Connecticut  and  Pennsylvania ,
extended a deadline for a bond exchange to refinance as much as
$1.1 billion of debt before a  credit line  matures next month.  Mohegan’s early tender deadline was extended a day to 5
p.m. in New York today, the Uncasville, Connecticut-based
company said in a statement. The casino operator moved the
deadline, initially set for Feb. 6, as tenders for its $500
million of notes due in 2012 and 2013 fell short of the 90
percent required in the offering. About 81.8 percent of those
notes had been tendered as of yesterday, Mohegan said.  The casino operator is overhauling its  capital structure 
after it warned that its failure to refinance debt last year
raised “substantial doubt” about its ability “to continue as
a going concern,” according to a Dec. 29 regulatory filing.
Mohegan had total debt including capital leases on Sept. 30 of
$1.64 billion, with $21 million in interest payments coming due
on Feb. 15.  The company said holders of about $375 million in two
subordinated bonds and $200 million of second-lien notes had
tendered enough to meet requirements through yesterday.  Bond Tenders  About 97.1 percent of the second-lien notes had been
tendered, more than the 50 percent needed, the company said.
Bondholders had tendered 90.3 percent of its senior subordinated
debt due in 2014 and $150 million of senior subordinated notes
due in 2015, the company said. The requirement for the
subordinated bonds is 75 percent.  Mohegan is offering to exchange the debt for new notes that
have the same principal as the original debentures. While most
of the new bonds would pay higher coupons, the old bonds would
have “substantially” all restrictive covenants eliminated or
waived, Mohegan said in a Jan. 24 statement announcing the
offer. The offers expire Feb. 22 and bondholders that tender
before the early deadline are given additional cash and
principal value from the new notes.  Mohegan’s $250 million of 8 percent senior subordinated
notes due in April rose 1.25 cents to 78.5 cents on the dollar
at 1:22 p.m. in  New York , according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
