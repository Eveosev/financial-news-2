Lloyd’s of London , the world’s
oldest insurance market, said claims related to the floods in
 Thailand  last year may cost it $2.2 billion.  The forecast is based on an estimated industrywide loss of
$15 billion to $20 billion, Lloyd’s said in a statement today.  “As additional information emerges, Lloyd’s actual net
claims from these events may vary from this preliminary
estimate,” Lloyd’s said. “These events are not expected to
give rise to either any material claims on the central fund or
to any material change in the overall level of capitalization of
the market.”  Earthquakes in  Japan  and  New Zealand , windstorms in the
U.S. and flooding in Thailand cost insurers about $105 billion
last year, making it the industry’s most expensive year on
record, surpassing the $101 billion paid out in 2005, the year
 Hurricane Katrina  struck  New Orleans , according to  Munich Re .
Insurers typically seek to raise prices to make up for losses
following a costly claims period.  “Our priority remains to assess and settle valid claims as
swiftly as we can,” Lloyd’s Chief Executive Officer Richard Ward said in the statement. “The Lloyd’s market is as well
capitalized as it has ever been. Paying these claims is within
the normal course of business for Lloyd’s.”  To contact the reporters on this story:  To contact the reporter on this story:
