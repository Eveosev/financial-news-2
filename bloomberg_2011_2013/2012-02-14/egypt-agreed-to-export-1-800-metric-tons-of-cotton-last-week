Egypt  agreed to export 1,800 metric
tons of cotton in the week ending Feb. 9, the Alexandria Cotton
Exporters Association said in its weekly bulletin.  The country has shipped 54,089 metric tons of cotton valued
at $172.7 million since the marketing year began on Sept 1. Of
last week’s sales, Egypt will ship 594 tons of the Giza 88
cotton variety, and 1,206 tons of Giza 86, the association said
today.  Egypt produces the world’s finest extra-long staple cotton,
which is stronger and softer than shorter staple cotton, and is
used in high-end clothing. Switzerland, Bangladesh and  India  are
the largest importers of Egyptian cotton.  To contact the reporter on this story: Abdel Latif Wahba in
