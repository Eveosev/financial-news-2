South Korea ’s unemployment rose to a
four-month high last month as weakness in the global economy
pared export demand.  The  jobless rate  was 3.2 percent, Statistics Korea said
today in Gwacheon, south of Seoul. That matched the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 11 economists and
compared with 3.1 percent in December,  The Bank of Korea held off raising benchmark  interest rates 
last week for an eighth month, the longest pause since
tightening began in July 2010. External uncertainty, weak
consumer and business sentiment, and high  household debt  are
weighing on growth and downside risks are greater than upside
risks, the central bank said.  “Weak external demand” will continue to weigh on the
labor market, Ronald Man, a Hong Kong-based analyst at HSBC
Holdings Plc, said before today’s data.  The seasonally unadjusted jobless rate was at 3.5 percent
in January, compared with 3 percent in December, today’s report
showed. The number of people employed increased by 536,000, or
2.3 percent, to 23.7 million last month from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
