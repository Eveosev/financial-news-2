Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) , the Czech unit of
France’s Societe Generale SA, fell after Moody’s Investors
Service cut its debt ratings on six euro-area countries, hurting
demand for riskier assets worldwide.  The stock dropped 1.2 percent to 3,666 koruna by 9:57 a.m.
in Prague, after rising 2.9 percent yesterday. The  PX (PX)  index of
companies retreated 0.6 percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
