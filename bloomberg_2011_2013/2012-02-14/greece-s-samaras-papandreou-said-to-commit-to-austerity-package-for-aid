The leaders of Greece’s two biggest
political parties, New Democracy’s Antonis Samaras and Pasok’s
 George Papandreou , will send written commitments tomorrow to the
so-called troika to stand by austerity measures, a government
official said today.  The assurance to the troika -- the  International Monetary
Fund , European Commission and European Central Bank -- was a
condition of an international bailout. European officials were
concerned that without the written pledges, the leaders would
retreat from budgets cuts after elections likely in April or
May,  To contact the reporter on this story:
