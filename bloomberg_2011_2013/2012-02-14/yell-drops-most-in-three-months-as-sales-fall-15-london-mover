Yell Group Plc (YELL)  fell the most in
almost three months after the publisher of the U.K.’s yellow
pages said sales declined 15 percent in the fourth quarter.  Yell dropped 17 percent, the biggest decline Nov. 16, to
4.87 pence in London after the Berkshire, England-based company
said that sales in the quarter ended Dec. 31 declined to 383
million pounds ($602 million.) Chief Executive Officer Mike
Pocock said in today’s statement the “deteriorating macro
environment and a more competitive digital directory market”
are driving a faster rate of decline in directory revenue.  “We remain concerned that an accelerated decline the
group’s predominantly print revenues could undermine required
investment” in its digital strategy, Numis said in a note to
today. Fourth quarter sales missed consensus estimates for 405
million pounds, according to Numis, which cut its forecast for
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and  amortization
for 2013 to 449 million pounds from 476 million pounds.  Yell said print advertisers fell 17.5 percent in the period
to 235,000, excluding White Pages and other directories. Print
revenue per advertiser was down 2.7 percent to 1,029 pounds,
while digital services sales rose to 35.4 million pounds.  Yell fell to its lowest since Dec. 21 at its close in
 London  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
