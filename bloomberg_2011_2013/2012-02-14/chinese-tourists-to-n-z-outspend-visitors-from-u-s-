Chinese tourists in  New Zealand 
outspent U.S. visitors last year for the first time on record,
according to a government report released in Wellington.  Spending by Chinese tourists gained 26 percent to NZ$457
million ($380 million) last year, the  Ministry of Economic
Development  said in a  statement . Spending by U.S. visitors fell
4.5 percent to NZ$447 million, the data showed.  New Zealand’s tourism industry, which makes up about 9
percent of gross domestic product, is encouraging visitors from
China as weak economic growth in the U.S. and  Europe , and
earthquakes that struck the South Island city of Christchurch,
deter arrivals. The New Zealand dollar’s 10 percent gain over
the past 12 months, the most by a Group of 10 currency, also
makes the country a more expensive destination for foreigners.  Earlier this month, Prime Minister John Key said he wanted
to boost trade and tourism links with the world’s second-largest
economy.  The number of tourists from  China  rose by 23,000 last year
to 146,000, the fourth-largest total after  Australia , the U.K.
and the U.S. Chinese travelers increased their average spending
per trip by 7 percent, today’s report showed. Total outlays by
tourists rose 3 percent to NZ$5.76 billion last year.  The Christchurch quakes, including a Feb. 22 temblor that
killed 185 people and wrecked hotels, restaurants and historic
buildings in the heart of the city, curbed tourist numbers,
today’s report showed.  Spending by Japanese, who are frequent visitors to the
city’s gardens and riverside, slumped 36 percent last year.  Still, the  Rugby World Cup , a seven-week tournament in
September and October, bolstered national visitor numbers. About
133,000 foreign fans attended the tournament and added as much
as NZ$340 million to tourist spending, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
