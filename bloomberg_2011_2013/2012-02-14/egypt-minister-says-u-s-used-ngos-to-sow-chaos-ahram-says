Egypt ’s planning minister has told
investigators that the U.S. directly funded non-governmental
organizations in the country with the aim of sowing chaos after
the fall of  Hosni Mubarak , the state-run Al Ahram newspaper
said.  Fayza Aboulnaga said the U.S. aimed to thwart a “historic
opportunity” for Egypt to regain its regional and international
stature, the Cairo-based newspaper said.  Egypt has referred 43 people, including the son of U.S.
Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, to trial after a probe into
foreign funding of NGOs. The inquiry has added to strains
between the U.S. and Egypt and jeopardized American financial
aid to the Egyptian military, a close ally.  To contact the reporter on this story:
