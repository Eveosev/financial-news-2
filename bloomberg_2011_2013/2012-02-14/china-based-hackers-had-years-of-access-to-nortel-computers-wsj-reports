Nortel Networks Corp. (NRTLQ)  lost data for
years to hackers based in  China  who penetrated the company’s
network by stealing executives’ passwords, the Wall Street
Journal reported, citing a former employee.  The unauthorized access took place from at least 2000,
according to the report. The data loss included the downloading
of technical papers, research-and-development reports, business
plans and employee e-mails, the newspaper said, citing Brian
Shields, a former Nortel employee who led an internal
investigation. Nortel did not disclose the unauthorized access
to prospective buyers of the company’s businesses, or bring it
to an end after discovering it in 2004, according to the report.  Nortel didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail sent to its
media relations department outside regular work hours. The
Chinese Ministry of  Foreign Affairs  didn’t immediately respond
to faxed questions seeking comment.  The Chinese embassy in Washington, when asked about the
Nortel hacking case, issued a statement saying in part that
cyber attacks are transnational and anonymous, and shouldn’t be
assumed to originate in China, according to the report.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
