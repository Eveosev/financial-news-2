Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc 
will rebrand its insurance business as Direct Line Group before
a planned sale of the unit.  The holding company will be renamed Direct Line Insurance
Group Plc, the Edinburgh-based lender said in an e-mailed
statement today.  RBS has to sell the division by 2013 to comply with a
European Union state aid rules after the lender received a
government bailout. The unit may be valued at about 4.7 billion
pounds ($7.4 billion), according to Gary Greenwood, an analyst
at Shore Capital in Liverpool.  To contact the reporter on this story:
