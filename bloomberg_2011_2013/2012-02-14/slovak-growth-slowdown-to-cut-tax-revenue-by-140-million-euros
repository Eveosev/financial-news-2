Slovakia will probably collect 140
million euros ($184.8 million) less in taxes than planned this
year as economic  growth  in the eastern euro-area member is set
to fall short of projections, Finance Minister Ivan Miklos said.  The  Finance Ministry  will propose spending cuts to the
government to ensure the budget  deficit  this year remains on
track to meet the target of 4.9 percent of gross domestic
product, Miklos said today at a press conference in Bratislava,
adding that the new government, which will form after March 10
elections, will need to take additional measures to improve
public finances.  Slovakia’s export-driven economy is being hurt by the
slowdown in the euro area caused by the region’s lingering debt
crisis. The shortfall in tax revenue is related to a revision
earlier this month of the 2012 economic-growth forecast to 1.1
percent from 1.7 percent, on which the budget was based.  Moody’s Investors Service cut Slovakia’s rating one level
to A1 yesterday, citing the worsening economic outlook. The
ratings company said chances of fiscal slippage have been
amplified by the October collapse of Iveta Radicova’s
administration, which led to a failure of the care-taking
government to agree on more fiscal measures before the early
elections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
