The eastern Chinese city of Suzhou
said it began checks of local factories after officials
discovered a company employed underage workers.  Authorities in Suzhou’s Wuzhong district found after
inspections that one female worker at Suzhou Nuosida Electronic
Technology Co. would not be 16-years old until Nov. 1, the
district government said in a faxed statement today. Chinese law
forbids the employment of workers younger than 16.  Another female employee, who began working on Dec. 21 of
last year, didn’t turn 16 until January 5, the government said.  Officials have begun a campaign to check other factories in
Wuzhong to ensure that all relevant laws are being followed, the
district government said in the statement.  -- Michael Wei . With assistance from Regina Tan in Beijing.
