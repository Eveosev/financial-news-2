The first gold exchange-traded fund
denominated in yuan closed little changed today after starting
to trade in  Hong Kong .  The Hang Seng RMB Gold  ETF (83168)  was introduced on the stock
exchange by a unit of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd., the Hong Kong-
based lender controlled by HSBC Holdings Plc. The fund closed at
34.90 yuan ($5.54) per share after opening at 34.85 yuan. One
share equals one-tenth of a gram and 31,800 shares traded.  Spot gold in yuan climbed 6.1 percent last year in Shanghai,
less than the 10 percent increase in bullion denominated in
dollars, as the Chinese currency climbed 4.7 percent.  “It sounds like a good proposition,” said Zhu Lv,
operations manager at Yinjian Futures Co. Zhu said that gold’s
increase in yuan terms may be less than in dollar terms because
of the appreciation of the currency.  Investors may take time to get familiar with the new
product, said Song Qing, a  fund manager  at Lion Fund Management
Co.,  China ’s first asset manager to place money in foreign
exchange-traded gold funds.  The Hong Kong ETF is designed to provide returns in yuan as
it tracks the performance of the London Gold Fixing Price in
dollars, according to the prospectus.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
