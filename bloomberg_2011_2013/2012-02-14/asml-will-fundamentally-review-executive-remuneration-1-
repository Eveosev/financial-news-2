ASML Holding NV (ASML) ,  Europe ’s biggest
semiconductor-equipment maker, said it will “fundamentally”
review the remuneration of its executives in 2012.  The Supervisory Board will consider the policy “in light
of the strategy, business model and senior management
compensation of ASML moving forward,” the Veldhoven,
Netherlands-based company said in its remuneration report.  For 2011, Chief Executive Officer Eric Meurice’s total pay
was 2.79 million euros ($3.67 million) while Chief Financial
Officer Peter Wennink’s was 1.65 million euros. Meurice’s base
salary was 787,000 euros and he received about 2 million euros
in bonuses and other compensation.  ASML projected six-month sales at about 2.4 billion euros,
in a “healthy start” to the year, Meurice said Jan. 18, after
fourth-quarter earnings beat analyst estimates. Customers’ new
products, such as tablets and smartphones, have bolstered sales
at ASML, which makes machines that produce chips for  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) ’s
mobile phones and  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPads.  ASML climbed 0.9 percent to 34.43 euros at 9:29 a.m. in
Amsterdam. The stock has risen 5.7 percent in the past year,
giving the company a market value of 14.8 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
