Total SA (FP) ’s  SunPower Corp. (SPWR)  sued rival
SolarCity Corp. for unfair business practices, claiming five
former SunPower employees illegally used trade secrets.  SunPower said a forensic investigation after the five left
the company showed they had copied “tens of thousands of
files” and moved information to SolarCity computers, according
to a lawsuit filed yesterday in federal court in San Jose,
 California .  “Defendants have willfully interfered with SunPower’s
ownership and possessory rights to such property without lawful
justification,” SunPower said in a complaint. The company is
seeking unspecified damages.  SunPower, based in San Jose, makes solar panels, and San
Mateo, California-based SolarCity is a distributor of such
panels and related equipment, SunPower said.  Jonathan Bass, a SolarCity spokesman, didn’t immediately
return voice and e-mail messages seeking comment on the lawsuit.  The case is SunPower v. SolarCity, 12-cv-694, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California ( San Jose ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
