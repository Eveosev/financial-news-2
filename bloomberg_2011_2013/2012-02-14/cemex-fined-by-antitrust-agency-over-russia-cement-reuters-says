Cemex SAB was fined 10.2 million
pesos ($800,500) by  Mexico ’s antitrust agency for
anticompetitive practice in the blocking of a 2005 shipment of
cement from  Russia , Reuters  reported , citing the regulator.  Cemex said the decision is unfounded and the company will
appeal, Reuters reported, citing the company. A group of
competitors tried to import 26,000 tons of the cement, which was
cheaper than Cemex’s product, Reuters said.  The ship carrying the cement, the Mary Nour, was held in
port for months before being turned away, Reuters said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
