Bovespa futures advanced, signaling
the stock gauge may rise a second day, after a report that
showed retail sales increased more than forecast in December
spurred optimism  Brazil  will withstand the global slowdown.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  may move after Chief Executive
Officer Maria das Gracas Foster said the oil company is at an
“advanced” stage with plans for asset sales. Tobacco company
 Souza Cruz SA (CRUZ3)  may be active after saying 2011 net profit rose 11
percent to 1.6 billion reais ($932 million).  Bovespa futures added 0.3 percent to 65,935 at 10:36 a.m.
in Sao Paulo. The real was little changed at 1.7165 per  U.S.
dollar .  Brazil’s retail sales rose 0.3 percent in December from
November, the national statistics agency said today in  Rio de
Janeiro . The median estimate from 44 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for an increase of 0.1 percent. Sales rose 6.7
percent from a year earlier.  “The retail data showed domestic consumption should remain
strong this year, sustaining Brazil’s growth even amid a global
economic slowdown,”  Luciano Rostagno , chief strategist at Banco
WestLB do Brasil, said by phone from Sao Paulo. “Positive news
coming from  Europe  also helps boost demand for riskier assets.”  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge jumped the most in eight
weeks yesterday after Greek lawmakers approved measures needed
to gain access to bailout funds. Italian 10-year bonds advanced
today after  Italy ’s borrowing costs fell at sale of 6 billion
euros ($7.9 billion) of bonds.  Relative Value  The Bovespa has advanced 16 percent this year, following an
18 percent slump in 2011, buoyed by Brazil’s interest-rate cuts,
signs of growth in the U.S. and renewed optimism Europe may be
closer to solving its debt crisis. The gauge trades at 10.3
times analysts’ earnings estimates, which compares with a ratio
of 10.5 for MSCI Inc.’s measure of 21 developing nations’
equities, weekly data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Traders  moved  7.07 billion reais in stocks in  Sao Paulo
