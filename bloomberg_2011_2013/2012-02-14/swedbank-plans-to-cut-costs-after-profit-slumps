Swedbank AB (SWEDA) , the largest lender in
the Baltic states, plans to cut costs by 1 billion kronor ($150
million) this year after reporting a 65 percent drop in fourth-
quarter profit.  Net income fell to 965 million kronor from 2.75 billion
kronor a year earlier, the Stockholm-based bank said today in a
statement. That beat the 891 million-kronor average estimate of
analysts surveyed by SME Direkt.  Swedbank wrote down 1.91 billion kronor of goodwill at its
Latvian business and took a staff restructuring charge of 330
million kronor. Chief Executive Officer Michael Wolf plans to
cut costs further this year as the lender guards against the
risk of a recession in  Europe .  “The current macroeconomic outlook is very uncertain and
there is a clear risk of recession in Europe,” Wolf said in the
statement. “We are planning a weak scenario and are focusing on
cost development.”  Swedbank fell 1.4 percent to 104.10 kronor as of 9:10 a.m.
in Stockholm trading, paring this year’s gain to 17 percent. The
company proposed a dividend of 5.3 kronor a share, more than the
5 kronor estimated by analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Capital Requirements  Sweden , home to four of the Nordic region’s six biggest
banks, wants its lenders to follow stricter capital standards
than those set out by the  Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision .  Swedbank’s core Tier 1 capital ratio was 15.7 percent for
the period under Basel 2, compared with 13.9 percent a year
earlier. The lender said it needs a core Tier 1 capital ratio of
13.5 percent to 14.5 percent because of tougher regulations and
withdrew its current target of at least 13 percent until 2013.  Net interest income, the difference between what the bank
earns from lending and what it pays on deposits, jumped 10
percent to 4.99 billion kronor in the quarter, while its net
commission income slipped 16 percent to 2.13 billion kronor. An
economic recovery in the Baltic region allowed Swedbank to
recoup 174 million kronor in bad-loan provisions in the quarter,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
