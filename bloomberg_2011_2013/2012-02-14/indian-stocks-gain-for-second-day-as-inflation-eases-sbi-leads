Indian stocks rallied for a second
day amid expectation slowing inflation may prompt the central
bank to lower borrowing costs to boost economic growth.  State Bank of India , the nation’s largest lender, rallied
to its highest since August.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the biggest
truckmaker and owner of Jaguar Land Rover, jumped 5.6 percent
after its quarterly profit beat estimates.  The BSE  India   Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, rose 0.7 percent
to 17,888.67, according to preliminary closing prices at 3:30
p.m. in Mumbai. Inflation eased to the lowest level in more than
two years in January, government data showed today. The Reserve
Bank of India last month pared banks’ reserves ratio and
signaled cuts in  interest rates  to stoke growth forecast by the
government to be the weakest this year since 2009.  “The RBI surprised us by reducing reserve ratios and that
is probably the biggest easing story, relative to expectations,
we’ve seen in emerging markets this year,” said Adrian Mowat,
the Hong Kong-based chief  Asia  and emerging-market strategist at
JPMorgan Chase & Co. “Indian inflation will move lower.”  Reserve Bank  Deputy Governor  Subir Gokarn  said Feb. 2 the
authority will reduce rates once it’s confident inflation will
keep slowing. Benchmark wholesale-price  index  rose 6.55 percent
from a year earlier, the government said today, compared with
7.47 percent in December. The median estimate of 25 economists
in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 6.7 percent jump. Policy
makers cut the amount banks must set aside as  reserves  for the
first time since 2009, joining nations from Brazil to Thailand
that have begun monetary easing.  India’s $1.7 trillion economy, Asia’s third biggest, will
expand 6.9 percent in the year ending in March, the least since
2009, the government said Feb. 7. Gross domestic product grew
8.4 percent in 2010-2011. The next policy review is on March 15.  Foreign funds have still purchased a net $4.1 billion of
Indian stocks since Jan. 1, after pulling out $512 million in
2011, contributing to the 15 percent jump in the Sensex. The
gauge sank 25 percent last year, its second-worst annual loss.
Emerging stock funds got $5.8 billion in the week ended Feb. 8,
the most since October 2010, Citigroup Inc. said last week, as
policy makers from  Brazil  to the Philippines cut funding costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
