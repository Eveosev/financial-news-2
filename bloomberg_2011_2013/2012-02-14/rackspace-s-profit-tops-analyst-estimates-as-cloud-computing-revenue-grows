Rackspace Hosting Inc. (RAX) , the biggest
competitor to  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  in the market for Web-based data
centers, reached a record high after sales and profit topped
analysts’ estimates.  Rackspace shares  climbed  8.9 percent to $53.60 at 9:32 a.m.
in  New York . Earlier it touched $54.09 for the highest intraday
price since Aug. 8, 2008, when the company first traded
publicly.  The company runs a fleet of data centers, letting customers
store their websites and applications on its servers. It
competes with the Amazon Web Services business in the  public-
cloud market , where customers rent computing power along with
related services. Rackspace’s revenue in that area jumped 86
percent last quarter to $58.5 million, the San Antonio-based
company said yesterday in a statement. Sales in the traditional
dedicated server business, where the company manages specific
machines for customers, rose 23 percent to $224.8 million.  Net income jumped 85 percent to $25 million, or 18 cents a
share, from $13.5 million, or 10 cents, a year earlier. Revenue
climbed 32 percent to $283.3 million. Analysts on average
predicted profit of 15 cents and sales of about $281 million,
according to a Bloomberg survey.  The stock, which debuted in 2008, has surged more than 10-
fold in value in the past three years. That’s more than Apple
Inc. can say -- its stock is up 407 percent during that stretch.
In fact, not a single company in the  S&P 500  has matched
Rackspace’s three-year performance, with  Wyndham Worldwide Corp. (WYN) 
coming the closest, at 959 percent.  More Customers  Rackspace’s customer tally increased 6.9 percent from the
previous quarter to 172,510. Its installed based rose 1.2
percent per month in the period, compared with growth of 0.6
percent a year earlier and 0.9 percent in the third quarter. As
that number grows, Rackspace’s margins increase because the
company is able to sell more profitable services to existing
customers, said Chief Executive Officer Lanham Napier.  “The longer we serve them, the more valuable and
profitable they become,” Napier said yesterday in a conference
call. “The installed base climbing is a tailwind for
profitability.”  The company’s margin before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization increased to 36.1 percent from 33.5 percent a
year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
