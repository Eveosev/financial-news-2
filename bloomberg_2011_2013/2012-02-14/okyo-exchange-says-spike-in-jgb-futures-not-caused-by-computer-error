A spike in government bond futures
after the  Bank of Japan  unexpectedly added to its asset
purchases wasn’t the result of a mistaken order, according to
the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange.  The price of 10-year bond futures for March delivery surged
briefly 143.37, rising by the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s daily limit
of 1. The exchange didn’t receive notification that any orders
were misplaced, spokesman Naoya Takahashi said in a phone
interview. A decision was made not to halt trading because the
price immediately retreated, Takahashi said.  The stability of the exchange’s trading systems is under
scrutiny as Tokyo and Osaka Securities Exchange Co. move closer
to a merger that was proposed partly in order to save computer
costs. A glitch at the Tokyo bourse on Feb. 2 halted trading for
2 1/2 hours in 241 securities including shares of Sony Corp. and
Hitachi Ltd., the worst disruption in six years.  The spike lasted for a few seconds at 12:51 p.m., about
seven minutes after the Bank of  Japan  unexpectedly added 10
trillion yen ($128 billion) to an asset-purchase program.  Stocks rose and the yen weakened against the dollar after
the central bank expanded stimulus for the first time since
October to revive an economy that shrank an annualized 2.3
percent last quarter.  The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which handles trading in bond
futures, allows investors to notify the bourse when mistakes are
made in placing orders, Takahashi said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
