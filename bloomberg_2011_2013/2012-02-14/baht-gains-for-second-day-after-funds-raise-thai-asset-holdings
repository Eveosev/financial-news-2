Thailand’s baht fell after Moody’s
Investors Service cut the debt ratings of six European countries
including Italy, Spain and  Portugal , damping demand for
emerging-market stocks.  The currency retreated from near a three-month high and the
MSCI Asia-Pacific  Index (MXAP)  of shares dropped after Moody’s said
yesterday the uncertainty over the euro area’s prospects for
changing its fiscal and economic framework was among the main
reasons for the downgrades. Global funds bought $678 million
more Thai equities than they sold this month through yesterday
and purchased a net $2.2 billion of government debt, data from
the stock exchange and the Thai Bond Market Association show.  “Moody’s downgrade may be regarded as a good excuse for
those who want to take profits from the recent appreciation
trend,” said  Yuji Kameoka , the Tokyo-based chief currency
strategist at Daiwa Securities Co. “With  Asia ’s economic
performance, funds are flowing into the region.”  The baht weakened 0.2 percent to 30.87 per dollar as of
3:33 p.m. in Bangkok after touching 30.71 earlier, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It reached 30.68 on Feb. 9, the
strongest level since Nov. 9.  Euro-area finance chiefs will meet in Brussels tomorrow to
decide whether to ratify a 130 billion euro ($171 billion)
rescue package for  Greece .  Thailand’s economy will expand 4.9 percent this year,
compared with a previous prediction of 4.8 percent, the central
bank said on Feb. 3. The monetary authority cut its growth
estimate for 2011 to 1 percent from 1.8 percent the same day.  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2017 was steady at 3.14 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
