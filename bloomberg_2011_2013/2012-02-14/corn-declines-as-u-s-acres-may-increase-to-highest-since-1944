Corn fell in  Chicago  after the U.S.
government said farmers in the world’s biggest producer may
plant the grain on the most acres since at least 1944, almost
doubling domestic stockpiles.  Sowing will climb to 94 million acres this year, lifting
production to 14.235 billion bushels from 12.31 billion bushels
a year earlier, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said
 yesterday . Stockpiles will jump to 1.62 billion bushels from an
estimated 843 million bushels, it said, giving projections
through 2021.  “Traders and farmers use that baseline report in planning
and pricing,” Eric Bailon, president of grain importer Paritas
Trading Corp., said by phone today from  Manila . “While it may
not always be accurate, farmers use it as an indicator of what
level prices will be in the next few months and years.”  Corn for May delivery declined 0.5 percent to $6.395 a
bushel by 1:15 p.m. London time on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices slid 11 percent in the past six months, partly on
speculation farmers will increase seeding.  The USDA estimates “confirmed what the market had already
expected,” said  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at Commerzbank AG
in  Frankfurt .  Corn may drop to $5.70 a bushel in the fourth quarter,  Paul Deane , an agricultural economist at Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd., said by phone from  Melbourne  today. Still,
“uncertainty” over U.S. yields may limit declines and the
harvest might be smaller than the USDA forecasts, he said.  Soybeans, Wheat  Soybeans for May delivery rose 0.1 percent to $12.6175 a
bushel. Sowing of soybeans in the U.S., the largest grower, will
drop to 74 million acres from 75 million acres a year earlier on
competition from corn, the USDA said. Yields will rise to 44
bushels an acre from 41.3 bushels, lifting production to 3.215
billion bushels from 3.046 billion bushels, it said.  Wheat for May delivery declined 0.6 percent to $6.4275 a
bushel. Seeding of the grain will rise to 56.5 million acres
from 54.4 million a year earlier, boosting output to 2.12
billion bushels from 1.999 billion bushels, the USDA said.  Milling wheat for May delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris rose 0.1 percent to 204.50 euros ($268.86) a metric ton.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
