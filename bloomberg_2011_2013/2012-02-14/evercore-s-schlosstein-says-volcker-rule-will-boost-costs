Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR)  Chief
Executive Officer Ralph Schlosstein said the Volcker rule, while
“well-intended,” will increase costs for investors and
companies.  “Its intent is to reduce risk in commercial banking and
investment banking,” Schlosstein said today in a Bloomberg
Television interview with Betty Liu. “But the line between
proprietary trading and market-making is almost impossible to
draw.”  The biggest U.S. banks are grappling with an overhaul of
the financial system through the Dodd-Frank Act and the so-
called Volcker rule, named for former Federal Reserve Chairman
 Paul Volcker . The rule, which takes effect this year, will limit
banks from trading on their own behalf and from investing in
private-equity and hedge funds.  “You wind up with this incredibly complex regulation with
incredibly complex enforcement, all of which will really
increase costs for investors and for companies in the U.S.,”
Schlosstein said.  Congress included the Volcker rule in the Dodd-Frank Act,
leaving the specifics of implementation to regulators. Yesterday
was the deadline for comments on guidelines proposed by the Fed
and other bank supervisors on how the rule would be put in
place.  To contact the reporters on this story:
