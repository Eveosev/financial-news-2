Moore Capital Management LLP, the
$15 billion hedge fund founded by Louis Moore Bacon, bought an
exchange-traded fund that tracks home builders and sold an ETF
that tracks the performance of high-dividend paying stocks.  Moore purchased 3 million shares of the  SPDR S&P
Homebuilders ETF (XHB)  in the fourth quarter, valued at about $51.3
million as of Dec. 31, according to a filing today with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The ETF tracking the S&P
homebuilders index fell 1.7 percent last year amid concerns that
a slowing U.S. economy would hurt the housing market. It rallied
15 percent in 2010 and 26 percent in 2009.  The firm sold 3.55 million shares of iShares DJ Selected
Dividend fund, valued at $171.3 million, according to the
filing. Moore had purchased the iShares ETF in last yearâ€™s third
quarter.  Moore also bought 6.1 million shares of lender  First
Niagara Financial Group Inc. (FNFG)  valued at $52.6 million. It sold
1.3 million shares of the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF worth
$69 million and 1.7 million shares of  Verizon Communications
Inc. (VZ)  valued at $62.6 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
