A United Nations panel is calling
for tougher inspections and detailed labeling of air shipments
of lithium batteries following two incidents in which aircraft
were destroyed when freight shipments burst into flames.  The Dangerous Goods Panel at the UN’s  International Civil
Aviation Organization  agreed Friday to the new standards, said
Mark Rogers, who heads hazardous-materials handling issues for
the  Air Line Pilots Association  union.  The action may lead to more stringent U.S. rules for
battery shipments. Congress earlier this month passed an
aviation bill restricting U.S. regulators from imposing rules
stricter than those set by the ICAO. Tighter rules proposed by
the Department of Transportation stalled following industry
objections that they would lead to higher consumer costs.  “I’ve been working on lithium batteries for 10 years and
this is the biggest development to date,” said Rogers, who
serves on the 19-member ICAO panel.  Without new safety standards, lithium batteries that can
spontaneously combust were projected to destroy one U.S.-
registered cargo jet every other year, according to a  study 
commissioned by U.S. and Canadian aviation regulators. Shipments
of lithium batteries that include those used in mobile phones,
tablets and  laptop computers  have been suspected of contributing
to two U.S. cargo-jet accidents since 2006.  The  Rechargeable Battery Association , which represents
companies such as  Apple Inc (APPL) . and Panasonic Corp., said in an e-
mail statement Feb. 13 that the ICAO panel’s recommendations
were a “reasonable compromise.”  New Rules ‘Imperative’  The industry group urged the Transportation Department’s
 Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration  to adopt
the ICAO standards, according to the statement.  “It is imperative that countries strictly enforce these
new regulations that go into effect on January 1, 2013, or the
hard work by the ICAO Panel will be for naught,” it said in the
statement.  The group previously said the proposed U.S. regulations
were too costly and wouldn’t improve safety. The ICAO standards
are less strict than the pipeline agency’s proposal.  Lithium batteries for products ranging from hearing aids to
laptops can be shipped on cargo planes with few restrictions
today.  The U.S.  Federal Aviation Administration  barred passenger
flights from carrying non-rechargeable lithium batteries in 2004
because they if they catch fire, flames cannot be stopped by
cargo compartment extinguishers.  Labeling, Inspections  Packages containing as much as 66 pounds (30 kilos) of
rechargeable  lithium-ion batteries  can be carried as cargo on
passenger flights under U.S. regulations.  Under the proposed ICAO standards, all lithium battery
shipments will have to be labeled as hazardous material, Rogers
said. Companies that want to ship batteries must train employees
on how to handle the battery shipments.  Airlines such as  United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) ’s United
Airlines or  FedEx Corp. (FDX)  would have to inspect the battery
shipments before loading them on a plane and after they are
removed, Rogers said.  Pilots would also be notified when lithium batteries are
loaded on a flight, he said.  The new standard would exempt shipments of two or fewer
batteries from the requirements as well as devices that have
installed batteries.  The ICAO panel’s recommendation will now be considered by
the organization, Stephane Dubois, a spokesman, said by phone.
It will become the international standard Jan. 1 if approved,
she said.  Two Accidents  Three pilots on a  United Parcel (UPS)  Service Inc. Boeing Co. DC-
8 barely escaped on Feb. 7, 2006, after fire broke out as they
approached Philadelphia, a U.S. National Transportation Safety
Board investigation found. The jet contained “numerous”
lithium batteries in computers and other devices, according to
the NTSB. The investigation, which focused on batteries, was
unable to determine the cause of the fire.  A UPS Boeing 747-400 that caught fire 22 minutes after it
left Dubai on Sept. 3, 2010, was carrying more than 81,000
lithium batteries, according to a preliminary report by the
General Civil Aviation Authority of the  United Arab Emirates .
The jet crashed at a military base while pilots tried to make an
emergency landing. Both pilots died.  To contact the reporter on this story:
