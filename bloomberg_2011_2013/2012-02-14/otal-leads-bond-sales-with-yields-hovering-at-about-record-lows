Total SA (FP)  and  Toyota Motor Credit
Corp. (5672A)  led at least $6.5 billion of U.S. bond offerings today as
companies locked in borrowing costs hovering at about the lowest
level on record.  Total, Europe’s third-largest oil producer, sold $2 billion
of debt split between five-year, 1.5 percent notes and 10-year,
2.875 percent bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Toyota Motor Credit, the finance arm of  Asia ’s biggest
automaker, sold $1.25 billion of three-year, 1 percent debt, the
data show.  Rock-Tenn Co., Rite Aid Corp. and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
UFJ Ltd. also issued bonds today, taking advantage of average
yields that fell to a record low 4.354 percent on Feb. 10 before
climbing to 4.366 percent yesterday. Including today’s
offerings, sales this month of $84.4 billion compare with $83.6
billion in all of February 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The extra yield investors demand to own company debt of all
ratings instead of Treasuries has fallen to 296 basis points, or
2.96 percentage points, according to the Bank of America Merrill
Lynch U.S. Corporate & High Yield Index. Spreads touched 295
basis points on Feb. 9, the narrowest in six months.  Paris-based Total’s five-year notes yield 78 basis points
more than similar-maturity Treasuries and its 10-year debt pays
a 95 basis-point spread, Bloomberg data show. Royal Dutch Shell
Plc and BP Plc are  Europe ’s largest oil companies.  Toyota Motor Credit, based in Torrance,  California , issued
its three-year notes at a spread of 67 basis points, Bloomberg
data show. Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi issued $1 billion of five-
year, 2.35 percent notes at a 155 basis-point spread, the data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
