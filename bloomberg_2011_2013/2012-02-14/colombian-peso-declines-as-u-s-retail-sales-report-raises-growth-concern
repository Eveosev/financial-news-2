Colombia’s peso fell the most this
year after a report showing U.S. retail sales rose less than
forecast cut into the appetite for higher-yielding, emerging-
market assets.  The peso dropped 0.7 percent to 1,790.20 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 1,778.20 yesterday. Today’s decline pared the peso’s gain
in the past three months to 6.9 percent, still the best
performance among 25 emerging-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  “The U.S. retail sales numbers are leading to some profit
taking after the rally we saw” in the peso, said Jorge Cardozo,
an analyst at Bogota-based brokerage Corredores Asociados SA.  Sales at U.S. retailers rose 0.4 percent in January, half
the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Reduced
risk appetite has helped ease gains in the local currency after
Colombian policy makers said Feb. 3 they would buy at least $20
million a day in the foreign exchange market.  The government also announced last month it won’t bring any
dollars into the country for financing in 2012, and will keep
$1.2 billion of royalty funds and at least $1 billion of
dividends offshore from state oil company Ecopetrol SA in a bid
to stem gains in the local currency.  Colombia  may take further action to curb the peso’s
appreciation as it fights its “own little currency war” to
protect export industries, Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said in a Feb. 9 interview.  The peso will probably strengthen to as high as 1,730 per
dollar between April and June as companies buy the local
currency to pay taxes in those months, according to Cardozo.  “Those are the months we see the biggest appreciation
pressures,” Cardozo said. The central bank’s dollar purchases
may help ease some of those gains, he said.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso bonds due
July 2024 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to
7.36 percent, according to the central bank. The price rose
0.269 centavo to 120.9520 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
