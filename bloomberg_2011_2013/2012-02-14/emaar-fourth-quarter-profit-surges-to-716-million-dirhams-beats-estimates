Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , the  United
Arab Emirates ’  biggest developer  by market value, said fourth-
quarter profit more than doubled as it cut costs and generated
more revenue from hotels and international operations.  Net income jumped to 716 million dirhams ($195 million)
from 274 million dirhams a year earlier, the company said today
in a statement. The average estimate of five analysts was for a
profit of 460 million dirhams, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Emaar, builder of the world’s tallest building, is
increasingly relying on retail and hospitality to cushion a
slump in home and office sales in its home market after property
prices slid by more than 65 percent. Operations in  Turkey ,
 Pakistan ,  Egypt ,  Syria  and  Saudi Arabia  contributed 1.81 billion
dirhams of revenue, or 22 percent, compared with 8 percent a
year earlier.  Total revenue in the fourth-quarter dropped to 2.24 billion
dirhams from 3.83 billion a year earlier while costs fell 63
percent to 970 million dirhams. Revenue rose 20 percent from the
third quarter to the fourth, Emaar said.  “Retail revenues came in 5 percent below our estimates but
the remaining segments delivered results beating our already
bullish expectations,” said Jan Pawel Hasman an analyst at EFG-
Hermes Holding SAE with a “buy” rating on the stock.  Hasman noted that Emaar’s gross margin widened to 57
percent, from 52 percent in the third quarter.  “Our strategy for 2012 is to further increase the share of
revenues from global operations and enhance the proportion of
profit from recurring revenue streams, including shopping malls
& retail and hospitality & leisure,” Chairman  Mohamed Alabbar 
said in the statement.  Bond Yield Falls  The yield on Emaar’s 7.5 percent $500 million convertible
bond due 2015 fell 15 basis points, the most in almost two
weeks, to 7.47 percent at 5 p.m. in Dubai.  Last year, Emaar completed 350 homes and more than 800,000
square feet of commercial space in Dubai and 604 homes in other
markets. Emaar has handed over more than 33,500 residential
units since 2001, the company said.  The developer also started Dawahi Development, a new unit
to invest in middle-income housing across the Arab world.  In December, the company signed an Islamic and conventional
 financing facility  valued at 3.6 billion dirhams, which was
backed by Emaar’s flagship Dubai Mall, the world’s largest.  Emaar rose 1.4 percent in Dubai trading to close at 2.98
dirhams today. The shares dropped 8.3 percent in the past 12
months, giving the company a market value of 18.2 billion
dirhams. The Dubai Financial Market General Index has fallen 38
percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
