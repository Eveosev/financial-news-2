CEZ AS (CEZ) , the Czech Republic’s largest
power producer, is under investigation for alleged fraud in
Albania,  Balkaninsight.com  news website reported yesterday,
citing Albania’s prosecutor.  The utility’s distribution unit is suspected of
overcharging customers and issuing fake fines, the website said,
citing the prosecutor.  CEZ has not been contacted by the prosecutor and is
therefore unable to comment, spokeswoman  Eva Novakova  said in an
e-mailed message. The company’s accounting is periodically
audited and electricity prices are set by the Albanian
regulator, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
