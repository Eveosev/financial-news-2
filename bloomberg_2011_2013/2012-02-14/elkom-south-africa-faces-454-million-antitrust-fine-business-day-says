Telkom South Africa (TKG)  Ltd., the
nation’s biggest fixed-line operator, dropped to the lowest in
more than eight years after Business Day reported the country’s
antitrust commission asked the Competition Tribunal to impose a
3.5 billion-rand penalty on the company.  The stock declined as much as 2.5 percent to 27.50 rand,
the weakest intraday level since Nov. 21, 2003, and traded 1.1
percent down at 27.90 rand by 9:07 a.m. in Johannesburg.  The  Competition Commission  asked the tribunal to impose the
fine on Telkom, saying the company has abused its dominant
position by charging excessive prices, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper said, citing the commition.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
