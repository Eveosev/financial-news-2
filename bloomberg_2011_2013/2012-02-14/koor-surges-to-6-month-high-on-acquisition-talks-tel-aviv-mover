Koor Industries Ltd. (KOR)  surged to the
highest level in more than six months after  Discount Investment
Corp. (DISI)  sought to buy the stake it doesn’t already own in the Tel
Aviv-based holding company.  Koor  shares  surged 5.8 percent to 55.45 shekels, the
highest level since Aug. 1, at the 4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv .
The shares have risen 16 percent since the joint announcement
yesterday. Discount Investment owns  63 percent of Koor ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Israeli billionaire Nochi Dankner holds a stake in Discount
Investment via his holdings in  IDB Holding Corp. (IDBH)   Dankner may be
required to simplify the organization of his investments as the
government reassess the “pyramid” structure of holding
companies, said Raz Mor, an analyst at DS Securities &
Investments in Tel Aviv.  “By merging with Koor, Dankner is eliminating a step in
the holding pyramid,” Mor said.  A government appointed committee asked business groups with
a “pyramid” structure to meet with its members to answer
questions. The panel, which is seeking to find ways to boost
competition, is set to release its findings in the next few
days, the  Finance Ministry  said on Feb. 12.  Discount Investment slipped 0.9 percent to 24.60 shekels.
IDB Holding, which owns stakes in both companies via its IDB
Development Corp. subsidiary, dropped 1.4 percent to 42.45
shekels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
