EON AG (EOAN)  said investments into German
offshore wind farms may be halted after 2015 because of delays
in connecting them to the  power grid ,  Berliner Zeitung  reported,
citing Mike Winkel, head of the utility’s clean-energy unit.  Hooking up EON’s Amrumbank West project in the North Sea
will be delayed by about 15 months, Winkel told the newspaper.
EON can’t take an  investment decision  on two additional projects
in planning because of the delays, he also told the newspaper.  He added that “no one will invest further” if the grid
connection remains uncertain, “neither EON nor others,” the
newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
