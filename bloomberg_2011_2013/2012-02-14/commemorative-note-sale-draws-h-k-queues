Hundreds of  Hong Kong  people
attracted by instant fourfold returns lined up overnight for
banknotes commemorating the  Bank of China Ltd .’s 100th
anniversary.  People were seen selling the special HK$100 notes, sold by
the bank at HK$150 ($19.35) each, for as much as HK$700 apiece
outside the lender’s Central district headquarters yesterday.
Customers were restricted to buying two notes each. One was
 advertised  at $149.99 on  EBay Inc. (EBAY) ’s Hong Kong site.  Collectors and those hoping to make a quick profit camped
outside the bank’s 50 branches in the city. The lines began
forming on Feb. 12, a day before the sale started, and people
again queued overnight on Feb. 13.  “We will resell the notes once we get them,” said Sunny
Wong, an 18-year-old local student who waited for more than two
hours outside the Central building. “There are buyers right
outside the bank’s doors. I hope to get at least a few hundred
dollars.”  The “overwhelming response” prompted Bank of  China  (Hong
Kong) Ltd. to hand out reservation slips to customers queuing
yesterday, the bank wrote in a statement sent to Bloomberg. The
lender said it completed distributing the tickets at 9 p.m.  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority told the bank to restore
public order by deploying more workers, and may require similar
future sales to be done by computer balloting, the Standard
newspaper said today, citing the city’s de facto central bank.  Limited Issue  The bank is offering 1.1 million single banknotes,
contained in a commemorative folder, through 50 branches in the
city until Feb. 20, according to its  website . The bank will also
sell 100,000 sets of three uncut HK$100 notes for HK$600 each
and 20,000 sets of 30 HK$100 uncut ones for HK$6,000 a set by
subscription, it said.  “I got here at around 3 a.m. and haven’t eaten since
then,” said a 66-year-old woman who would only provide her
surname as Lee. “I know people are reselling the notes but I
won’t -- it’s a limited edition and I really want to collect
them,” she said, as she sat on stool in the queue.  The bank is set to raise about HK$145 million ($18.7
million) for charity through the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
