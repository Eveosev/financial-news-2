Maritime pilots stopped guiding
vessels through the  Houston Ship Channel  before dawn today
because fog reduced visibility at the largest U.S. petroleum
port, the Coast Guard said.  Pilots halted transits to Houston at 4:45 a.m. local time
today, Phillip Woods, a Coast Guard watch supervisor in Houston,
said in an interview. Pilots who guide ships to the ports of
Galveston and  Texas City  halted at 5:15 a.m., he said.  The suspension left eight deep-draft vessels waiting for
passage to Houston and nine ships in the port as of 6 a.m. local
time, he said. Two ships were waiting passage to Galveston or
Texas City  An advisory for dense fog is in effect for the area until 9
a.m., according to a notice posted by the  National Weather
Service  on its  website  at 5:5o a.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
