Ukraine,  Brazil  and the European
Union increasingly will shape the world corn market during the
next decade, as the U.S. share of exports steadily declines,
according to the Department of Agriculture.  The U.S. percentage of the global corn trade will drop from
about 55 percent now to less than 47 percent by 2021, the USDA
said yesterday in an annual 10-year baseline forecast.  China ,
the world’s top soybean- and cotton-buyer, will quadruple its
purchases of the grain to feed livestock, the department said.  “Favorable resource endowments, increasing economic
openness, wider use of hybrid seeds, and greater investment in
agriculture” will aid a 60 percent jump in exports from nations
of the former  Soviet Union , the USDA said in the  report . In
addition, “Brazilian production and exports of corn are
projected to increase in response to high world prices.”  U.S. farmers this year will plant the biggest corn crop
since World War II, prompted by the highest prices in at least
four decades, according to a Bloomberg survey of farmers,
bankers and analysts. Prices for the most valuable U.S. crop
traded in Chicago averaged $6.79 a bushel in 2011, a record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
