An early morning fire at a Manhattan
apartment building owned by  Equity Residential (EQR)  injured 11
people, including one firefighter.  The New York City Fire Department responded at 5:03 a.m. to
a blaze at the 42-story Trump Place apartments at  180 Riverside
Blvd.  on the Upper West Side, Jim Long, director of public
information for the Fire Department, said in an interview.  The fire was on the third floor of the building, in
apartment 3V, according to Long. Ten people had minor injuries,
and another was transported to New York-Presbyterian/Weill
Cornell Medical Center in serious condition, he said.  “The cause is not known at this time,” Long said. “The
marshals are investigating.”  Equity Residential is the largest publicly-traded apartment
owner in the U.S. It owns 15 multifamily properties in
 Manhattan , including three Trump Place Buildings on Riverside
Boulevard, according to the Chicago-based company’s  website .  Marty McKenna, an Equity Residential spokesman, did not
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
