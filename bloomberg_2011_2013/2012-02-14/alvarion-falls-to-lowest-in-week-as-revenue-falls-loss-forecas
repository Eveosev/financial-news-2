  Alvarion Ltd. (ALVR)  declined to the
lowest in a week after the telecommunications-equipment maker
reported a drop in fourth-quarter revenue and forecast  a first-
quarter loss.  The  shares  dropped 1.9 percent to 4.42 shekels, the lowest
level since Feb. 7, at 4:08 p.m. in Tel Aviv.  Revenue declined 12 percent to $41.2 million as the company
posted a $12 million net loss. It used $5.8 million in cash for
its operations. Alvarion forecast a first-quarter loss per share
of between 3 cents and 8 cents.  Alvarion “is continuing to deplete its cash reserves
because of falling revenue” and is forecasting another loss,
said  David Levinson , an analyst at  Bank Hapoalim Ltd. (POLI)  in  Tel
Aviv .  To contact the reporter on this story:
