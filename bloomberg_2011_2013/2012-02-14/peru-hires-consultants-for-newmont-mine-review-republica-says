Peru’s government hired consultants
to conduct an environmental review of  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) ’s
stalled $4.8 billion Peruvian gold project, daily  La Republica 
reported in its online edition.  Cabinet Chief Oscar Valdes’s office signed contracts with
Spanish consultants Luis Lopez and Rafael Fernandez and will
sign a third with Portuguese geologist Jose Martins Carvalho to
overhaul the environmental impact study for the Minas Conga
deposit, the Lima-based newspaper said, citing state electronic
contracting agency Seace.  The 40-day review of the Minas Conga project, postponed by
environmental protests in November, will cost 647,000 soles
($240,000), La Republica said.  Newmont welcomes the review, spokesman  Omar Jabara  said
today in e-mailed comments. Valdes’ spokesman Luis Urmeneta
didn’t immediately respond to a telephone call and an e-mail
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
