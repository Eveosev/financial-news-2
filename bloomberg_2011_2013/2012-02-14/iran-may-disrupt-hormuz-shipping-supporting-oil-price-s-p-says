Iran  might respond to sanctions with
low-level provocation such as slowing shipping through the
Strait of Hormuz, keeping  oil prices  at “their currently high
level,” according to three Standard & Poor’s reports.  Iranian authorities could disrupt supplies of oil from the
Persian Gulf by imposing tanker inspections or boarding merchant
ships in its territorial waters, supporting oil prices because
markets would increasingly view armed conflict as “a real, if
remote, possibility,” according to the reports’ authors, who
include Jean-Michel Six, S&P’s chief economist for  Europe .  There is a very low likelihood of severe disruption of oil
supplies through the strait, through which 20 percent of the
world’s oil flows, though, if one did occur, it might boost oil
to $150 a barrel and push economies into a recession, according
to the reports.  “For oil-producing sovereigns of the Gulf Cooperation
Council --  Saudi Arabia , U.A.E., Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, and to a
lesser extent,  Bahrain  -- higher oil prices would actually be
beneficial,” credit analyst Elliot Hentov wrote. “As oil
exporters, they would receive more foreign earnings that they
could either use to stimulate demand or improve their
government’s balance sheets.”  The U.S. and the European Union are imposing tougher
sanctions on Iran and Israel has talked of an attack on the
Islamic Republic’s nuclear facilities in an attempt to halt its
atomic program. Iran, which says its nuclear program is for
civilian purposes, has threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz
in retaliation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
