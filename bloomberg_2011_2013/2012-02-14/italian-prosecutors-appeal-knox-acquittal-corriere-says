Italian prosecutors have appealed
the decision of a court in Perugia,  Italy , to overturn the
murder convictions of Amanda Knox and her former boyfriend for
the 2007 murder of her British student Meredith Kercher, daily
 Il Corriere della Sera  reported, citing a document filed by
prosecutors.  Knox, a 24-year-old American, had originally been convicted
and sentenced to 26 years for the murder and had served four
years in jail before the decision was overturned in October.
Knox and Kercher were both students who shared a house in
Perugia.  Knox left Italy and returned to her home in Seattle.  To contact the reporter on this story:
