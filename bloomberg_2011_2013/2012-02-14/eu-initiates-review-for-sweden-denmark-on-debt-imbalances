Sweden  and  Denmark  will be reviewed
under the European Union’s new rules on economic governance, the
European Commission said.  The macroeconomic situation in the two Nordic countries
“needs to be investigate further,” the EU’s executive arm said
today, also starting reviews of 10 other countries in the 27-
nation bloc, including Finland.  Sweden, the largest Nordic economy, is under review for
“increasing household indebtedness,” while “the stock of
private sector debt remains very high” in Denmark, the
commission said.  The commission, the EU’s Brussels-based executive arm,
singled out the EU economies in need of review in its first
annual Alert Mechanism Report, released today. The report
measured countries based on 10 macroeconomic indicators,
including debt and asset bubbles.  EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn ,
presenting the report in Strasbourg,  France , said the debt
crisis shows that macroeconomic imbalances pose “serious
risks.” The other economies that need to be investigated are
Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, France, Hungary, Slovenia, Spain, and
the U.K., according to the statement.  The group also singled out Sweden for having a current
account surplus, “above the indicative threshold,” according
to the report. Denmark faces deteriorating price competitiveness
“due to high nominal wage agreements in a period of overheating
and weak productivity growth,” the commission said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
