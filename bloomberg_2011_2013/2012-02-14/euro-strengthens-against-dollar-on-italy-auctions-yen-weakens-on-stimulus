The euro strengthened against the
dollar after Italy sold the maximum amount at a bond auction,
with borrowing costs falling to the lowest since March.  The 17-nation currency appreciated 0.2 percent to $1.3210
at 10:28 a.m. London time, and climbed 0.7 percent versus the
yen to 103.05.  The Italian Treasury sold 4 billion euros ($5.3 billion) of
benchmark securities due in November 2014 to yield 3.41 percent,
down from 4.83 percent at the last auction of similar-maturity
bonds on Jan. 13. The nation also sold 2015 and 2017 debt.  The yen weakened 0.6 percent against the dollar to 78.02
after  Japan â€™s central bank unexpectedly added 10 trillion yen
($128 billion) to an asset-purchase program and set an inflation
goal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
