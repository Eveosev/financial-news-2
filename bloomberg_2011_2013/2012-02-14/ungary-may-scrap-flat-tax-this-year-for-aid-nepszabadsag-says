Hungary may need to abolish its
“flat” income tax system as early as during the course of this
year to satisfy demands by the  International Monetary Fund  in
return for a bailout,  Nepszabadsag  reported, citing unidentified
government officials.  It is becoming “increasingly” certain that the 16-percent
income tax rate will be changed to help obtain the international
aid, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
