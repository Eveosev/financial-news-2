The  U.S. economy  has about 10
million fewer jobs than it should and economic output is about
$1 trillion below where it ought to be, former Treasury
Secretary  Lawrence Summers  said.  “Our economy still remains well short of its potential,”
Summers said in a speech in Calgary today. “That downturn casts
a substantial shadow forward over the U.S. economy.”  Summers, who is a professor and researcher at the John F.
Kennedy School of Government at  Harvard University , said he
doesn’t anticipate any “large fiscal actions” from the U.S.
government in the next months. Changes will probably come after
the presidential elections, he said at the University of Calgary
School of Public Policy-sponsored event.  “I am very encouraged by President Obama’s budget which
puts a focus on growth but makes clear a commitment to
containing health-care costs and putting the debt to GDP ratio
in the U.S. on the downward trajectory to which it should
return,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
