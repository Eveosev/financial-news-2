Spanish and Portuguese bonds fell,
increasing the extra yield investors demand to hold the
securities over German bunds, after Moody’s Investors Service
cut the ratings of six European countries.  German bunds outperformed most of their euro-region peers
after the rating company said it had downgraded  Italy ,  Spain ,
Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Malta, boosting demand for
safer assets. Economists say a report today will show German
investor confidence rose in February. Spain sold bills today,
while Italy is scheduled to auction notes. Euro-area finance
chiefs will meet in Brussels tomorrow to decide on a second
financial aid package for Greece.  We’re seeing “some spread widening because of the latest
bad news on the Moody’s rating downgrades,” said Christian Reicherter, an analyst at DZ Bank AG in  Frankfurt . “That trend
should last over the whole day and then the main event is
tomorrow. Everybody is waiting for the EU finance ministers’
meeting in Brussels and news on  Greece .”  Spain’s 10-year yield climbed three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 5.29 percent at 9:55 a.m.  London  time. The
5.85 percent bond due in January 2022 fell 0.2, or 2 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,317) face amount, to 104.26.  The extra yield investors demand to hold the Spanish
securities over 10-year bunds increased three basis points to
336 basis points.  The German 10-year yield was little changed at 1.93 percent
after dropping to 1.89 percent, the lowest since Feb. 7.  Moody’s Downgrades  Spain was downgraded to A3 from A1 late yesterday, Italy to
A3 from A2 and Portugal to Ba3 from Ba2, all with negative
outlooks. Moody’s also lowered the ratings of Slovakia, Slovenia
and Malta.  Portugal ’s 10-year yield increased five basis points to
11.97 percent, widening the spread over bunds by five basis
points to 10.05 percentage points. Italy’s 10-year yield rose
one basis point to 5.61 percent  “Policy makers have made steps forward but we do not think
they have done enough to reassure the market that we are on a
stable path,” said Alistair Wilson, chief credit officer for
 Europe  at Moody’s in London.  French bonds fell after Moody’s also said it may strip
 France  and the U.K. of their top Aaa ratings. The French 10-year
 yield  climbed three basis points to 2.94 percent.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research’s index of
investor and analyst expectations for  Germany  rose to minus 11.8
from minus 21.6 in January, its third monthly increase,
according to a Bloomberg  survey  before today’s report.  Spain sold a combined 5.45 billion euros of bills, the
central bank said, compared with a maximum target of 5.5 billion
euros set for the sale. Demand for the 364-day debt was 2.27 the
amount sold, compared with 3.54 last time the securities were
sold in January. The bid-to-cover ratio for the 553-day bills
was 2.88, versus 3.23 times last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
