The ruble weakened against the
dollar, paring yesterday’s gains, as  Brent crude  retreated and
Moody’s Investors Service lowered the debt ratings of six
European countries.  Russia’s currency depreciated 0.3 percent to 30.0025 per
dollar at the 7 p.m. close in Moscow after strengthening 0.6
percent yesterday. The ruble was 0.2 percent stronger at 39.50
per euro and was little changed at 34.2764 against the central
bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Brent crude declined as much as 0.8 percent a barrel after
Moody’s cut the debt ratings of six countries and revised its
outlook to “negative” for the U.K. and  France , a sign demand
for Russian exports in the region may falter. Russia’s central
bank may be buying foreign currencies to slow the ruble’s 7.1
percent advance against the dollar in 2012,  Renaissance Capital 
said.  “There aren’t a lot of reasons why I would be bullish on
the ruble,”  Ivan Tchakarov , chief economist for Russia and the
former  Soviet Union  at Moscow-based Renaissance, said in an
interview at Bloomberg’s headquarters in New York yesterday.
“We’ve reached levels where the central bank has started
intervening.”  Bank Rossii manages the ruble within a so-called “floating
corridor” against a basket of dollars and euros to limit swings
that erode the exporters’ competitiveness. A level of 33.87 to
34.20 against the basket at the corridor’s current levels
implies the regulator is buying between $50 million and $150
million a day, according to OAO Rosbank’s estimates.  Investors increased bets on the ruble weakening, with non-
deliverable forwards showing the currency at 30.3817 per dollar
in three months, compared with expectations of 30.278 per dollar
yesterday. Government ruble bonds due June 2017 fell, pushing
the yield up four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to
7.57 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
