Estonian poverty worsened more for
children than for the rest of the population after the Baltic
nation endured the European Union’s second-worst recession in
2008-2009, the  Justice Chancellor’s office  said in a report.  Children living below the minimal subsistence level
exceeded that of the total population by 1.6 times in 2010,
compared with 1.3 times in 2004, according to the  report , which
was published yesterday on the office’s website.  “Children are in a worse situation than the rest of
society,” according to the report. “Altogether 26 percent, or
more than 63,000 children under 18, lived at risk of poverty or
in absolute poverty” in 2010.  Estonia  passed austerity measures of more than 9 percent of
gross domestic product in 2009 to meet euro-adoption terms,
 exacerbating an economic slump  that wiped almost a fifth off
output over two years. The benefits system is insufficient to
help families with children out of poverty, according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
