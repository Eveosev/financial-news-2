The ruble will weaken against the
dollar this year as the central bank acts to subdue gains in the
currency and protect exporters, according to  Renaissance
Capital .  “There aren’t a lot of reasons why I would be bullish on
the ruble,”  Ivan Tchakarov , chief economist for Russia and the
former Soviet Union at Moscow-based Renaissance, said in an
interview at Bloomberg’s headquarters in New York yesterday.
“We’ve reached levels where the central bank has started
intervening.”  Tchakarov predicts that the ruble will weaken to 30.3 per
dollar by the end of 2012. The currency strengthened 0.6 percent
to 29.9 per dollar in Moscow yesterday.  Bank Rossii manages the ruble against a  basket  of dollars
and euros to limit swings that erode the competitiveness of
exporters.  The central bank has made “huge progress” in moving from
monetary policy focused on controlling the  exchange rate  to
targeting inflation, Tchakarov said. “Russians have become more
adjusted to more volatile ruble movements.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
