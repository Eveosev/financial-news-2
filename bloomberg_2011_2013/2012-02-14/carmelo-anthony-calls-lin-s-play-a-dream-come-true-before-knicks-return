New York Knicks  forward  Carmelo Anthony  called the emergence of point guard Jeremy Lin “a dream
come true” for a team that has won five straight games.  Anthony, 27, also said he doesn’t expect to have any
difficulty adjusting to the new offense when he returns this
week after being sidelined by a strained right groin.  “When I get back, Jeremy will have the ball in his hands
and I’m playing off of that,” Anthony told reporters yesterday
at a team practice. “It’s easy, give him the ball and space out.
I get back to doing what I know how to do best.”  Anthony, who leads the Knicks with 22.3 points per game,
has missed the past three games. Forward Amar’e Stoudemire is
expected to return to the lineup tonight against the Raptors in
Toronto after missing a week for his brother’s funeral.  Lin, a 23-year-old Harvard graduate, has scored 20 or more 
points in five straight games, including four starts, for the 
Knicks (13-15). No other player in NBA history has scored at 
least 20 points and collected seven assists in his first four 
starts, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.  “It takes some pressure off of me,” Anthony said. “I
don’t have to play point guard. I don’t have to try to get
Amar’e 20 points, try to get this guy 20 points, me try to go
out there and get 25-30 points a night, play defense, rebound,
do the whole thing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
