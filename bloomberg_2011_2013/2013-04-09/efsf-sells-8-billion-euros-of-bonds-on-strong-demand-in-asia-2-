The European Financial Stability
Facility issued 8 billion euros ($10.5 billion) of bonds amid
strong investor demand in  Asia , helping boost the euro to its
highest levels in more than three weeks.  The European rescue fund sold 0.875 percent, five-year
securities yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Investors in Asia made up 29 percent of the buyer base, up from
5 percent on EFSF’s 4 billion euros of March 2016 bonds issued
in February, according to a person familiar with the
transaction, who asked not to be identified citing lack of
authorization to speak publicly.  Speculation is rising that money will flow out of  Japan  in
search of higher yields elsewhere after  Bank of Japan (8301)  Governor
Haruhiko Kuroda said April 4 that the central bank will double
its monthly bond purchases to 7.5 trillion yen ($76 billion).
The move sent yields on 10-year Japanese  government bonds  to
less than 0.5 percent, and pushed the yen to its weakest levels
since 2009 against the dollar.  The euro touched $1.3103 yesterday, the most since March
15, before falling to $1.3083.  “I’m sure EFSF had some influence” on the euro’s rise,
Brad Bechtel, managing director at Faros Trading LLC in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut , said in a telephone interview. The Bank
of Japan “has definitely been a consistent driver for the past
couple of days for sure. I would expect that to continue.”  About 200 investors requested orders totaling 14 billion
euros on the bond sale, the EFSF said yesterday in a statement.
It has a funding target of 16.5 billion euros in the second
quarter.  Peripheral Yields  BNP Paribas SA, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and HSBC Holdings
Plc managed the offering, Bloomberg data show.  Yields on peripheral European countries’ bonds have fallen
relative to German bunds in the aftermath of the BOJ’s
announcement of its unprecedented stimulus designed to double
Japan’s monetary base within two years.  Spain’s 10-year bonds yield 4.71 percent, or 3.4 percentage
points more than similar-maturity German bunds, compared with a
spread of 3.6 percentage points a week ago. The gap for Italian
securities tightened to 3.1 percentage points from 3.3
percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
