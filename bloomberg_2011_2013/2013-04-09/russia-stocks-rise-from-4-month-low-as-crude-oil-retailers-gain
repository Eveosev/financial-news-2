Russian  shares  rebound from a four-
month low as crude oil, the nation’s chief export earner,
increased and consumer stocks advanced.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  climbed for the first time in dour days,
0.6 percent to 1,417.18 by 10:52 a.m. in Moscow. Trading volume
was 21 percent above the 30-day average, while 10-day  price
swings  increased to 8.524. OAO Magnit,  Russia ’s biggest retailer
by market value, rose 1.7 percent to 6,436.90 rubles, the
highest intraday price since its July 2006 listing after
 Standard & Poor’s  yesterday raised the company’s credit rating
to BB from BB-, citing “robust” earnings growth.  Crude oil climbed 0.2 percent to $93.55 in  New York , the
second day of gains. Russia receives about half its budget
revenue from oil and natural gas. Out of 50 stocks on the Micex,
38 rose and 12 fell. The dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  added 0.6
percent to 1,419.63.  “All the risks that were weighing on the Russian market in
February and March have been priced in by now and the situation
is turning to the bright side,” Alexander Ivanischev, head of
research at Infina Investment Co. in Moscow, said by phone.
“Oil fell a lot last week so now we’re seeing a rebound, while
Magnit is an excellent company, its management has chosen the
right strategy and stuck to it.”  PhosAgro Offer  OAO PhosAgro,  Europe ’s largest phosphate-fertilizer
producer, fell as much as 5.7 percent, trading down 3.7 percent
at 1,329.30 rubles. The stock tumbled 4.5 percent to $14.10 in
 London . Phosagro’s controlling owners, Andrey Guryev and his
family, are selling a 9 percent stake for the company to gain
entry into the MSCI Russia index.  A group of companies, controlled by the Guryev family, is
offering at least 11.1 million of existing shares and global
depositary receipts, according to a statement from Phosagro late
yesterday. The Guryev family will reinvest about 45 percent of
the proceeds in new shares issued by the Russian company,
according to the statement. Phosagro plans to sell as many as
13.5 million new shares after the offering, it said.  Federal Grid Co. power transmission company dropped as much
as 3.5 percent, trading down 3.2 percent at 13.58 kopeks. OAO
MRSK Holding, the nation’s largest electricity distribution
company, fell as much as 4.1 percent before trading down 3.3
percent at 1.445 rubles.  Russian Grids  The board of directors of OAO Russian Grids, as the merged
company is known, approved issuing an additional 161 billion
shares at 2.79 rubles each, which can be paid for in cash or
swapped for Federal Grid shares at 28.36 kopeks each, according
to a filing yesterday. Russia will exchange the ordinary stock
it holds in Federal Grid for new shares of Russian Grids,
acquiring 86 percent in the new company as a result.  “We do not rule out a further correction in Federal Grid
shares due to the expected shift of liquidity to MRSK Holding
and subsequent decrease in the weight of Federal Grid in MSCI
indices,” Alfa Bank analysts said in an e-mailed note. “We
also do not see clear catalysts for MRSK Holding, even at the
current depressed  price levels , taking into account tariff
growth restrictions and its high capex needs.”  Putin Decree  President  Vladimir Putin  in November signed a decree
transferring 79.55 percent of Federal Grid’s shares to MRSK
Holding. Federal Grid will become a unit of Russian Grids and
its shares will continue to be listed and trade on the Moscow
Exchange, according to today’s statement.  The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in
 stock futures , rose 2.3 percent today. The Market Vectors Russia
ETF, the largest dedicated Russian exchange-traded fund, added
0.9 percent to $27.21 yesterday. The  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity
Index (RUS14BN)  increased less than 0.1 percent to 94.60 in New York
yesterday.  Russian equities have the cheapest valuations among 21
emerging markets tracked by Bloomberg. The Micex trades at 5.2
times estimated earnings and has lost 3.9 percent this year,
compared with 10.2 times for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index,
which has slid 4.1 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
