Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE) , the
operator of Colombia’s largest oil field, rose the most on
record in Bogota after reporting daily output in the first
quarter was close to the upper end of its target range.  Shares rallied 7.9 percent to 37,420 pesos at 12:42 p.m. in
Bogota, the best performance on the  Colcap (COLCAP)  index, which fell 0.7
percent. Rubiales earlier rose 9.6 percent, the biggest intraday
gain since it began trading in Bogota in December 2009. The
stock pared its drop over the past month to 16 percent.  Chief Executive Officer Ronald Pantin said today in a
statement that the company will try to cut operating costs by
about $8 per barrel for the rest of the year by trimming
spending on production, transportation and diluents. The company
said last month that  operating costs  for 2012 jumped 17 percent
from the prior year to $39.77 per barrel.  “The underperformance in the last month or so has really
been driven by their reported increase in operating costs, and
the market has been reacting in a very negative way,” Justin Anderson, a Calgary-based analyst at Salman Partners, said in a
telephone interview. “This release seems like an attempt to
calm the market.”  Rubiales’s net production after royalties in the first
quarter was 126,000 to 128,000 barrels of oil equivalent per
day, a 30 percent increase from last year’s average, according
to a statement today. Pacific said in a  presentation  at the
beginning of the year that it was forecasting 115,000 to 130,000
barrels a day for 2013, which Pantin said at the time was
“conservative guidance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
