Access Bank Plc (ACCESS) , Nigeria’s fourth-
biggest bank by market value, fell to the lowest in more than
three months after it was downgraded by FBN Capital Ltd.  The lender retreated 7.5 percent to 9.17 naira by the close
in Lagos, the commercial capital, the lowest since Dec. 31. FBN
Capital lowered Access Bank to underperform from neutral and the
12-month target price was reduced to 8.30 naira per share.  First-quarter results were below expectations and have
weakened chances of the bank meeting return-on-equity forecasts
for this year, Bunmi Asaolu, an analyst at Lagos-based FBN
Capital, said in e-mailed report today.  Access Bank’s profit in the three months through March
declined 27 percent to 9.21 billion naira, the lender said
yesterday. Revenue dropped to 52.7 billion naira from 53.1
billion naira.  The stock has gained by 1.3 percent this year, compared
with the 19 percent advance by the 10-member  Bloomberg Nigerian
Stock Exchange Banking Index (NGSEB10)  and 22 percent rise in the  Nigerian
Stock Exchange All-Share Index. (NGSEINDX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
