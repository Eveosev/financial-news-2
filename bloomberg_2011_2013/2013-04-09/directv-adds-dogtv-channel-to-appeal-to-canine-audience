DirecTV (DTV) , the largest U.S. satellite-television provider, will begin airing DogTV, a $5.99-a-month premium channel aimed at canine viewers.  Under a multiyear agreement between DirecTV and DogTV, the channel will be available on the satellite service in the third quarter, according to a statement today. Financial terms weren’t disclosed.  DogTV, which calls itself the first and only TV network for dogs, is designed to comfort animals and stave off loneliness when pet owners are out of the house. The  DirecTV (DTV)  agreement marks the biggest distribution deal for the nascent channel, which is currently available online for $9.99. It’s also being offered as an on-demand channel to Cox Communications Inc. subscribers in  California  for $4.99 a month.  “We know dog parents are constantly seeking solutions to ease the loneliness and boredom of their stay-at-home pups, and now they will be able to access DogTV through  DirecTV (DTV) ,” Gilad Neumann, chief executive officer of the channel, which is operated by PTV Media Ltd., said in the statement.  Darris Gringeri, a spokesman for El Segundo, California-based DirecTV, didn’t respond to a request for comment.  To keep dogs stimulated, DogTV broadcasts “scenes with and without other animals, animation sequences and a variety of moving objects,” the network said  on its website . It also offers relaxation programming with soothing music. The colors and audio are adjusted to fit a dog’s senses.  DirecTV’s 20 million human customers “opens the door for more viewers to experience our innovative programming for dogs,” Neumann said.
