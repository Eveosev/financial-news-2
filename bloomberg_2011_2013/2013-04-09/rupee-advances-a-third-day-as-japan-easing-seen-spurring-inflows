India’s rupee strengthened for a
third day, the longest run of gains in a month, on speculation
unprecedented monetary easing by Japan will boost inflows into
emerging-market assets. Bonds gained.  Overseas funds pumped $12.2 billion into Indian  stocks  and
 debt  this year, exchange data show, as the central bank cut its
benchmark rate by 50 basis points to 7.5 percent to spur  growth 
in Asia’s third-largest economy. The  Bank of Japan (8301)  said last
week it will double the monetary base by the end of 2014 by
buying  government securities .  “The news from Japan is fairly significant and there is
optimism of increased fund inflows into India,” said  Gaurav Kapur , a senior economist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in
Mumbai. “Given weak growth conditions, there is a case for more
rate cuts, which will also help attract foreign funds as that
would push up Indian shares.”  The rupee strengthened 0.2 percent to 54.445 per dollar as
of 10:24 a.m. in Mumbai, data compiled by Bloomberg show. One-
month implied volatility in the rupee, a gauge of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose eight basis
points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 7.85 percent.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.48 per
dollar, compared with 55.64 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.40 versus 55.54. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  Industrial Output  India’s industrial  output  probably fell 1 percent in
February, according to a Bloomberg survey before data due April
12. The  Reserve Bank  of India reduced its  repurchase  rate by 25
basis points each in January and March, and the next review is
scheduled for May 3.  Government bonds  advanced for the fifth day, sending the
yield on benchmark notes due 2022 to a three-week low.  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 fell two
basis points to 7.89 percent in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
