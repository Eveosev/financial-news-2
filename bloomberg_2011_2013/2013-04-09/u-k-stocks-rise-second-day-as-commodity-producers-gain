U.K. stocks  advanced for a second
day, led by commodity producers, as manufacturing rose more than
forecast, Alcoa Inc. began the U.S. earnings season with profit
that beat projections and Chinese inflation eased.  Rio Tinto Group, Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. and
 Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ)  climbed more than 4.5 percent, pulling the  FTSE
350 Mining Index (F3MNG)  to the biggest gain in three months.  Vedanta
Resources Plc (VED)  rallied 5.3 percent after its Cairn India Ltd.
unit found oil in a new well.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  increased 36.27 points, or 0.6 percent,
to 6,313.21 at the close of trading in London. The gauge has
rallied 7 percent this year as U.S. lawmakers agreed on a
compromise budget and data fueled optimism the world’s biggest
economy is recovering. The broader FTSE All-Share Index also
advanced 0.6 percent and Ireland’s ISEQ Index rose 0.5 percent.  “We’ve had a period of some weeks where commodity prices
have been falling; it looks like we’re beginning to see a
reversal of that as China comes back into the market and demand
and confidence comes in again,” John Meyer, a partner at SP
Angel, a London-based broker and adviser, told Francine Lacqua
on Bloomberg Television. “Right now, you’re going to get better
performance out of the stocks rather than the commodities
themselves.”  The volume of shares changing hands in FTSE 100-listed
companies was 26 percent lower than the average of the past 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Manufacturing Gains  U.K.  manufacturing  rose twice as much as economists
forecast in February as it rebounded from a slump during snow
the previous month. Factory output increased 0.8 percent from
January, when it fell a revised 1.9 percent, the Office for
National Statistics said. The median forecast of 29 economists
in a Bloomberg survey was for a gain of 0.4 percent.  Alcoa, the largest U.S. aluminum producer, said late
yesterday that earnings excluding one-time items were 11 cents a
share in the first quarter, beating the 8 cent-average analyst
forecast. Revenue trailed projections.  Profits at companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may
contract 1.8 percent in the first quarter, the first drop since
2009, analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show.  Inflation in China eased more than forecast, reducing
pressure on policy makers to tighten credit, as the world’s
second-largest economy recovers from a slowdown. The  consumer
price index  rose 2.1 percent in March from a year earlier, the
National Bureau of Statistics said today in Beijing. That
compares with the 2.5 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of economists.  Rio Tinto  Rio Tinto added 4.8 percent to 3,135 pence as copper and
lead increased on the London Metal Exchange. ENRC and Kazakhmys,
which mine in Kazakhstan, rallied 5.1 percent to 260 pence and
5.6 percent to 393.50 pence, respectively. BHP Billiton Ltd.,
the world’s largest mining company, rose 3.5 percent to 1,944
pence, the biggest advance since Jan. 2.  Ferrexpo Plc (FXPO)  soared 19 percent to 184.9 pence, the largest
jump since July 2009. The Ukrainian iron-ore producer said
first-quarter pellet production from its own ore gained 10
percent from a year earlier.  UBS AG said this year’s  selloff  in U.K. mining shares,
driven by concern about China’s policy makers tightening credit
and the U.S. Federal Reserve ending monetary easing, sets up a
buying opportunity.  Vedanta rose 5.3 percent to 1,116 pence, its highest price
in three weeks. Cairn India, which Vedanta  acquired  for $8.67
billion in 2011, said it discovered oil after a gap of four
years when it resumed drilling in a new deposit in its block in
the western state of Rajasthan.  Banks Advance  U.K.  lenders rallied , snapping a four-day decline.  Barclays
Plc (BARC)  led gains, jumping 3.2 percent to 286 pence.  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  increased 2.9 percent to 273.9 pence and
 Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  rose 1.9 percent to 47.18 pence.  Persimmon Plc (PSN) , Britain’s largest homebuilder, added 2.9
percent to 1,033 pence, extending this year’s advance to 29
percent. An index of U.K.  house prices  rose in March as
transactions picked up and the outlook improved, the Royal
Institution of Chartered Surveyors said in a report.  AZ Electronic Materials SA (AZEM)  plummeted 35 percent to 240
pence, the biggest drop since its October 2010 initial public
offering. The supplier of chemicals used in devices such as
Apple Inc.’s iPad said earnings margins will be below normal
levels this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
