Investcorp SA, the Bahrain-based
investment company, agreed to buy five U.S. office properties
valued at about $200 million as it focuses on cities with
economic growth and low unemployment.  Investcorp acquired Westmoor Place in Denver, One Westchase
Center in Houston and Tysons Commerce Center outside of
Washington, the company said in a statement today. The
properties purchased have total space of 1.08 million square
feet (100,000 square meters) and a combined occupancy rate of
more than 94 percent.  “The acquisition of these high-quality properties in major
U.S. markets provides an excellent opportunity to generate
current income, while improving operating and leasing
performance over the longer term,” Herb Myers, managing
director at Investcorp, said in the statement.  Demand for U.S. commercial properties is nearing its 2007
peak as buyers seek to take advantage of a stronger economy and
rising occupancy.  Firms from outside the U.S. acquired $2.83 billion of
Houston office buildings in the past three years, according to
Real Capital Analytics Inc., making them the largest net buyers
of any investor class.
