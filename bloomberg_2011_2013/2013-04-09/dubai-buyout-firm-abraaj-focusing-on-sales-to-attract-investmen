The Abraaj Group, the Middle East’s
biggest buyout firm, said it plans to sell two to three of its
investments this year to attract fresh capital for its funds.  “A key thing for us is achieving exits from the portfolios
we’ve built up over the years,” Ahmed Badreldin, a senior
partner at Abraaj, said in an interview at a Bloomberg
conference in Doha yesterday. There is “appetite” for the
Middle East and North Africa and “there are investors who want
to invest in MENA only. Those are the ones we focus on and a key
thing is demonstrating exits,” he said.  Fund-raising by private-equity firms in the Middle East and
North Africa fell to $672 million in 2011, less than half the
$1.5 billion of 2010, according to a study published last June
by the MENA Private Equity Association, a Dubai-based lobby
group. Firms struggled to attract investors as uprisings toppled
governments in  Egypt , Tunisia and Libya and Europe’s sovereign-
debt crisis worsened.  Abraaj, which has $7.5 billion of assets under management,
plans to sell its stakes in Middle Eastern supermarket chain
Spinneys, a Tunisian pharmaceuticals company and a unit of oil-
and gas-service company Stanford Marine Group, a person with
knowledge of the matter said on Feb. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
