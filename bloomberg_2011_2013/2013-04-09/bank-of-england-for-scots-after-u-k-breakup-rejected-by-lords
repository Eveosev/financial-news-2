Scotland ’s plan to keep the Bank of
 England  as the lender of last resort and to influence its policy
making should nationalists win their bid for independence is
“implausible” and “fanciful,” a panel of lawmakers said.  Voters in Scotland will decide in a referendum set for
Sept. 18, 2014, whether to leave the 306-year-old U.K. The semi-
autonomous government in Edinburgh has proposed that the new
state would continue using the pound and become a shareholder in
the central bank, which would oversee Scottish lenders.  In a report published today, the  Economic Affairs Committee 
of Britain’s upper House of Lords said the requirements of
joining the European Union would mean Scotland would need its
own financial regulator. This would create a situation where
Scotland’s banks had two regulators in different countries.  This proposal “implies that the  Bank of England  would
accept risks over which it had little control, which seems
implausible,” the report said. On the idea of giving Scotland a
share in the bank, it concluded: “We do not see why the U.K.
government would agree to this proposal.”  Scottish insurance companies , which sell more than 90
percent of their products to the rest of the U.K., would face
additional compliance costs and complexity from having two
regulators, according to the panel.  “The proposal for the Scottish government to exert some
influence over the Bank of England, let alone the rest of the
U.K. exchequer, is devoid of precedent and entirely fanciful,”
the committee said in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
