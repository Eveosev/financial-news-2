Russia accused vote-monitoring group
Golos of flouting legislation passed last year by failing to
declare itself a foreign agent.  “Golos is financed from abroad and is engaged in political
activities in the Russian Federation,” the Justice Ministry
said today in a statement on its website.  Golos hasn’t declared itself a foreign agent because it
only takes Russian donations, deputy director Grigory Melkonyants said by phone. The watchdog may be fined 500,000
rubles ($16,123) and the authorities may open a criminal case to
close it, he said.  Russia in 2012 required groups that get money from abroad
to register as foreign agents and submit to tighter controls.
The Justice Ministry threatened to close human-rights
organization Memorial, Golos and the Moscow branch of anti-graft
watchdog  Transparency International  after they vowed to flout
the rules. The Kremlin ordered the closing of U.S. aid agency
USAID, which has financed Golos and Memorial.  Raids on Russian non-government organizations are “routine
events” designed to determine whether the NGOs’ activities
“comply with their declared goals,” President  Vladimir Putin 
said March 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
