Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos urged the European Central Bank to introduce measures to
heal divisions in the banking market, tempering Prime Minister
Mariano Rajoy’s call for the central bank to match the
quantitative easing in the U.S. and Japan.  The higher financing costs faced by companies in Italy and
Spain compared with northern Europe are holding back economic
growth and encouraging  depositors  to shift savings to banks in
the core euro countries, de Guindos said during a debate in
Madrid today.  Asked what action he’d like from the ECB, de Guindos said,
“I’d underline the fragmentation of the capital markets.”  “That concerns the ECB because it shows the mechanism of
monetary transmission isn’t working,” he added.  Rajoy went further yesterday, arguing European Union
leaders should give ECB President Mario Draghi political backing
to flood the economy with money matching the efforts of the
other central banks in developed economies. The ECB is drawing
up proposals for channeling credit to smaller companies in the
periphery and Draghi last week said it may cut interest rates to
a record low.  “Companies in Italy or Spain that may be in a better
situation than those in the north are paying more,” de Guindos
said today. “As a result we may see movements in deposits which
are not ideal.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
