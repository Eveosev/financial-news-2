Herbalife Ltd. (HLF)  said KPMG LLP
resigned as its independent accountant after finding that a
partner allegedly was involved in insider trading in the
nutritional-supplements company’s shares.  The resignation is because KPMG concluded its independence
had been compromised and wasn’t related to Herbalife’s financial
statements, accounting practices or its management’s integrity,
Cayman Islands-based Herbalife said today in a statement. The
change is effective immediately.  KPMG said in a statement on its website that it was
resigning from two clients after finding that the partner
in charge of its audit practice in Los Angeles was involved in
providing non-public client information to a third party. The
firm said it has no reason to believe the companies’ financial
statements were materially misstated.  Herbalife shares, which were halted pending the
announcement, had gained 17 percent this year through yesterday,
compared with a 9.6 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
