Slovakia is ready to accept Russia’s
Rosatom Corp. as a partner for the construction of a new nuclear
reactor if  CEZ AS (CEZ)  leaves a joint project with the state, the
Economy Ministry said.  CEZ, the  Czech Republic ’s biggest utility, is considering
selling its stake in a venture set up with state-controlled
JAVYS to carry out the project, the ministry said in a  document 
scheduled for a Cabinet discussion tomorrow in Bratislava. The
state, which has a pre-purchase right for the stake, would
negotiate with the Russian company on conditions for allowing it
to take the shares, according to the document.  Slovakia picked the Czech company in 2008 as a partner to
build a nuclear unit in Jaslovske Bohunice at an estimated cost
of between 4 billion euros ($5.2 billion) and 6 billion euros.
CEZ, which paid 117 million for a 49 percent share in the
venture, is shelving the project as it wants to focus on
building new blocks at its Temelin plant in the Czech Republic.  The administration of Premier  Robert Fico  has supported the
construction of nuclear plants in an effort to make the country
self-sufficient in power needs. The new Bohunice unit is planned
to be built at the site of an existing nuclear plant, where  Enel
SpA (ENEL) ’s local unit already operates two reactors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
