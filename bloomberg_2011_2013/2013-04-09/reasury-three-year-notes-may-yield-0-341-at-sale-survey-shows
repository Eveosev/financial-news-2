The Treasury’s $32 billion sale of
three-year notes may draw a  yield  of 0.341 percent, according to
the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 10 of the
 Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers.  The notes, which mature in April 2016, yielded 0.34 percent
in pre-auction trading. The record-low auction yield of 0.327
percent was reached Dec. 11. The amount being offered today is
unchanged from the previous 30 sales of the maturity. Bids are
due by 1 p.m.  New York  time.  The March three-year note offering’s  bid-to-cover  ratio,
which gauges demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount
offered, was 3.51, after reaching a record 3.96 at the October
sale. The average at the past 10 auctions was 3.60.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 20.6 percent of the notes at the
March 12 sale after being awarded 18 percent the month before,
the lowest level on record. That compared with 28.4 percent at
the January auction and an average of 26.6 percent at the past
10 offerings.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 23.4 percent of
the securities at the last sale, compared with a record high
26.9 percent at the February offering and an average of 19
percent at the past 10 auctions.  Treasury three-year notes have gained 0.2 percent this
year, compared with a return of 0.6 percent in 2012, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The broader Treasuries
market has returned 0.5 percent this year after gaining 2.2
percent last year.  The Treasury Department is selling $66 billion in notes and
bonds this week. It’s due to auction $21 billion of 10-year
securities tomorrow and $13 billion of 30-year debt on April 11.
The sales will raise $6.7 billion of new cash, as maturing
securities held by the public total $59.3 billion, according to
the Treasury.  Primary dealers trade  government securities  with the Fed
and are obliged to participate in Treasury sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
