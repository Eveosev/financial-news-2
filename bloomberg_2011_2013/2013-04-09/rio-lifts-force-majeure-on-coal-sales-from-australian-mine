Rio Tinto Group, the world’s second-
biggest mining company, said it had lifted the force majeure
declared on thermal coal supply contracts from its Kestrel mine
in  Australia  after flooding damaged a rail line.  The clause, invoked by companies when they miss shipments
because of circumstances beyond their control, was lifted on
March 12, Matthew Klar, a Brisbane-based spokesman for Rio, said
in an e-mail today. The company announced force majeure on Jan.
30, according to a statement on its website.  Flooding from tropical cyclone Oswald in January swamped
the Blackwater rail line that transports the commodity to the
port of Gladstone in Queensland.  Xstrata Plc (XTA) , the world’s
largest exporter of thermal coal, declared force majeure on Jan.
29 because of damage to the system, which was reopened Feb. 6.  The Blackwater rail network carries the second-largest coal
tonnages in Queensland and serves mines operated by companies
including Rio, Xstrata and  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)   To contact the reporters on this story:
