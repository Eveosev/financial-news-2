Jefferies Group LLC, the investment
bank that sold itself to  Leucadia National Corp. (LUK) , said it had
one day of trading losses in the quarter ended Feb. 28.  Jefferies’s average daily value-at-risk, a measure of
potential trading losses, was $9.27 million for the period,
compared with $13.4 million in the prior three months, the New
York-based company said today in a regulatory filing.  The decrease was partly “due to lower equity price risk,”
according to the filing, which also cited a “decrease in
interest-rates risk, resulting from reduced volatility in
interest-rate asset classes.”  Leucadia  completed  its purchase in March in a deal that the
companies said would help Jefferies weather market turmoil.
Richard Handler, the leader of Jefferies, took over as Chief
Executive Officer of Leucadia as part of the transaction.  Excluding an investment in Knight Capital Group Inc.,
average daily VaR was $5.99 million in the period ended Feb. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
