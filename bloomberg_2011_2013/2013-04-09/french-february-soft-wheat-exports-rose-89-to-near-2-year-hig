French soft-wheat exports, the
European Union’s biggest, surged 89 percent in February from a
year earlier as shipments to  Algeria  rose 16-fold and those to
 Morocco  more than doubled, customs data showed.  France  shipped 1.88 million metric tons of soft wheat in
the month, the most in a single month since March 2011 and
rising from 993,227 tons a year earlier, according to Bloomberg
calculations using trade  data  published online today.  French wheat and barley exports are forecast by the
country’s crop office to rise in the year through June after
drought reduced harvests in Russia and Ukraine. Soft-wheat sales
will rise 4.9 percent to 16.9 million tons, it said. Exports in
the first eight months of the crop year climbed 17 percent to
11.4 million tons, customs data show.  Paris-traded milling wheat for May delivery was at 212.25
euros ($319.05) a ton by 2:19 p.m. in the city, compared with
$260.24 a ton for wheat in  Chicago  for delivery the same month.  Soft-wheat sales to Algeria, the largest buyer of French
wheat, jumped to 414,014 tons from 24,500 tons a year earlier.
France was the world’s fifth-biggest wheat shipper last year,
after the U.S., Australia, Russia and Canada, based on data from
the International Grains Council.  Shipments of soft wheat to Morocco advanced to 271,370 tons
from 127,948 tons in February 2012, deliveries to Yemen advanced
to 137,499 tons from 33,000 tons and  Tunisia  took 106,598 tons
from none a year earlier.  The monthly volume of barley exports almost doubled to
582,043 tons from 293,121 tons in February, boosted by rising
deliveries to  Belgium  as well as shipments to Syria and  Turkey ,
where none was shipped a year earlier.  French exports of durum wheat, the hard variety used to
make pasta and couscous, dropped 41 percent to 89,560 tons from
150,668 tons. Corn exports in February fell 8.9 percent to
464,112 tons from 509,642 tons a year earlier as shipments to
the Netherlands and Spain slipped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
