A top U.S. military official
confirmed today that  North Korea  has moved a Musudan missile to
its eastern coast.  “As has been widely reported, there has been a Musudan
movement to the east coast,” Admiral Samuel Locklear, the head
of U.S. Pacific Command, said at a hearing of the Senate Armed
Services Committee. He said the missile has a range of 3,000 to
3,500 miles and could possibly hit the U.S. territory of  Guam ,
though not the U.S. mainland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
