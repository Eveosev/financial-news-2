Palm oil  advanced to the highest
level in more than a week on speculation that inventories in
 Malaysia  probably fell last month as exports from the world’s
second-largest producer increased.  The contract for delivery in June climbed as much as 0.8
percent to 2,419 ringgit ($792) a metric ton on Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives, the highest price for the most-active futures since
March 28, before trading at 2,414 ringgit at 11:28 a.m. in  Kuala
Lumpur . Futures lost 33 percent in the past year.  Inventories shrank 7 percent to 2.27 million tons in March
from a month earlier, the steepest drop since January 2011,
according to the median of estimates from two plantation
companies and four analysts in a Bloomberg survey published
yesterday. Output gained 2.3 percent to 1.33 million tons, while
exports rose 2.1 percent to 1.43 million, according to the
survey. The Malaysian Palm Oil Board is scheduled to release the
official data tomorrow.  “We’re looking at the stockpiles to trim lower and if this
turns out to be true it will boost the palm oil market,” Ker Chung Yang, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte., said by phone
from  Singapore . Inventories may remain between 2.1 million tons
and 2.3 million tons in the next few months, he said.  Reserves have fallen 7.2 percent to 2.44 million tons in
February from a record 2.63 million tons reached in December,
according to the board. Shipments from Malaysia rose 5.5 percent
to 1.37 million tons in March, according to Societe Generale de
Surveillance.  Soybean oil  for May delivery was little changed at 49.49
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for
delivery in May climbed 0.4 percent to $13.835 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for September delivery rose 0.7 percent to
6,326 yuan ($1,020) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month gained 0.5 percent to
7,956  yuan  a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
