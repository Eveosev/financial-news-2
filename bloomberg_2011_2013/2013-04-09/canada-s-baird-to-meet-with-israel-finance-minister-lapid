Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister
John Baird will meet today with Israeli Finance Minister Yair Lapid as Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. seeks a takeover of
 Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL)   Baird’s meeting was confirmed by  Israel ’s Finance Ministry
in an e-mail. Baird met with Israel Corp. Chairman Amir Elstein
at a restaurant yesterday in Tel Aviv, daily newspaper Calcalist
reported. Israel Corp. holds a 52 percent stake in ICL,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “He will try to soften the opposition in the government to
the deal,” Richard Gussow, an analyst at DS Securities &
Investments said today by phone, referring to Baird. “It is
obvious he is here also to do public relations for the Potash-
ICL deal.”  The acquisition of ICL, the nation’s second-largest
publicly traded company, has sparked opposition from ICL workers
and politicians including Lapid. Potash Corp., a Canadian
company, held talks in October with the Israeli government about
raising its stake in ICL from 14 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
