Egypt, the world’s largest wheat
buyer, will consider resuming imports of the grain from
 Kazakhstan , the state-run Middle East  News Agency  reported,
citing Reda Aggag, an advisor to Supply Minister Bassem Oda.  Oda will meet with Kazakh officials today to discuss
Kazakhstan providing Egypt with imports assistance, the agency,
known as Mena, said, without giving further details.  Egypt, the Arab world’s most populous nation, didn’t import
any grain from the landlocked Central Asian country for the past
two years, according to Mena. Kazakhstan is an approved wheat
source on a list held by the state-run  General Authority  for
Supply Commodities, which also includes Russia, France and the
U.S. among others.  Egypt last imported grain from Kazakhstan in the marketing
year 2009-10, when it bought 180,000 metric tons, according to
Nomani Nomani, an adviser to the minister and former head of the
authority. In 2011,  Egypt  refused to take four cargoes of Kazakh
wheat because of the high recurrence of damaged seeds in them
and replaced them with Russian grain, Nomani said today by phone
from Cairo.  Kazakh wheat imports may only resume if Kazakhstan resolves
the issue with the seeds and finds suitable ports in neighboring
countries to ship the grain, Nomani added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
