Belarus will allow  Sweden ’s interim
charge d’affaires to work in Belarus, the country’s Foreign
Ministry  said  on its website, citing bilateral consultations
with the Swedish Foreign Ministry.  “Belarus has made a positive decision regarding the
request from Sweden to accredit its interim charge d’affaires in
Belarus,” the Foreign Ministry said today in the statement.  Belarus expelled the Swedish ambassador and pulled out its
entire embassy staff from Sweden in August after Swedish pilots
flew an airplane into Belarus and dropped teddy bears with signs
calling for free speech. The incident prompted President
Aleksandr Lukashenko to fire his border-guard and air-force
chiefs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
