Taylor Morrison Home Corp. (TMHC) , a
builder owned by TPG Capital and Oaktree Capital Management LP,
raised $628.6 million in its initial public offering, pricing an
increased number of shares at the top of the marketed range.  The Scottsdale, Arizona-based homebuilder sold 28.6 million
shares for $22 each, according to a statement yesterday, after
offering 23.8 million shares for $20 to $22. The shares will
start trading today, listed on the New York Stock Exchange under
the symbol TMHC.  Taylor Morrison is going public amid a strengthening U.S.
housing recovery. Demand for new houses has come back after the
worst housing crash since the Great Depression as buyers seek to
take advantage of low  mortgage rates  while facing a diminished
supply of existing properties on the market. U.S.  new homes  sold
at an annual pace of 411,000 in February, up 12 percent from a
year earlier.  The company planned to sell all of the stock in the
offering, according to the original terms of the prospectus, and
to use $275 million of the proceeds along with $7 million of
cash on hand to buy shares back from existing investors.
According to regulatory filings before the offering, Fort Worth,
Texas-based TPG and Los Angeles-based Oaktree would each own 39
percent of the company post-IPO.  TPG and Oaktree led a buyout of Taylor Morrison from its
U.K.-based parent  Taylor Wimpey Plc (TW/)  in March 2011. The takeover
was valued at $1.2 billion, including a $620.3 million equity
investment from TPG and Oaktree along with JH Investments Inc.
The remainder of the purchase was financed with debt. TPG and
Oaktree subsequently invested $150 million more, filings show.  Top 10  Taylor Morrison, which builds in five U.S. states and
 Canada , had net income of $430.8 million and sales of $1.44
billion last year, ranking it among the 10 largest publicly
traded homebuilders by revenue, according to its prospectus.
It sold 4,014 homes in the U.S. and Canada with an average price
of $364,000.  Orders increased about 46 percent, to 1,697 homes, in the
first quarter from a year earlier, the company said in a
regulatory filing April 8.  Credit Suisse Group AG and Citigroup Inc. led the offering.  To contact the reporters on this story:
