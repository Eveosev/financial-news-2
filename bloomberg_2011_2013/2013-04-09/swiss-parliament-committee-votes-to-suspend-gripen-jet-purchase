The Swiss Parliament’s Defense
Committee has voted to suspend the purchase of 22  Saab AB (SAABB)  Gripen
aircraft, asking the government for additional information.  “We are putting the Gripen deal on hold until some
important questions are answered and the definitive agreement is
available,” Beat Flach, a lawmaker for the Green Liberal party
and member of the committee, said on his Twitter Inc. feed
today. A spokeswoman for the Defense Ministry confirmed the
outcome of the vote, declining to comment further.  Switzerland plans to spend about 3.1 billion Swiss francs
($3.3 billion) on the planes made by Saab, based in Linkoeping
south of  Stockholm , to replace aging  Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC)  F-5
Tigers. Today’s vote is the second parliamentary setback for the
acquisition, after the upper house last month failed to approve
funding.  The purchase is controversial because it requires spending
cuts in other areas, as a balanced budget is enshrined in
Switzerland’s constitution. The Gripen deal may also face a
national  referendum .  European Aeronautic Defence and Space  Co. has written a
letter to parliament offering to supply Switzerland with
Eurofighters for 1.5 billion francs, Blick newspaper reported
today, without saying where it got the information. That follows
a similar overture by  Dassault Aviation SA (AM)  in January, according
to Sonntagszeitung. Both companies lost to Saab in the initial
bidding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
