U.S. stocks  rose, giving the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index its first back-to-back gain in more
than three weeks, on optimism over earnings and as commodities
gained amid a report showing  China ’s inflation slowed.  Raw-materials producers rose 1.1 percent amid speculation
that tamed inflation would reduce pressure on Chinese policy
makers to tighten credit. Microsoft Corp. and  Intel Corp .
rallied more than 3.1 percent as investors snapped up technology
shares, the worst performing group this year. Alcoa Inc. was
unchanged after posting earnings.  J.C. Penney (JPM)  Co. slumped 12
percent as it ousted Chief Executive Officer  Ron Johnson  and
reinstated his predecessor, Myron E. Ullman III.  The S&P 500 rose 0.4 percent to 1,568.61 at 4 p.m. in  New
York . The  Dow (INDU)  Jones Industrial Average added 59.98 points, or
0.4 percent, to 14,673.46, its highest-ever closing level. About
5.8 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, 8 percent
below the three-month average.  “The commodity pop is basically tied to the view on
China,”  Ralph Shive , the  South Bend , Indiana-based manager of
the $1.2 billion Wasatch-Large Cap Value Fund, said by phone.
“The market is acting strongly. It doesn’t seem to want to go
down. You get dips, and they seem to pop right back.”  The S&P 500 has gained 1 percent in the past two days as
investors speculated first-quarter earnings would help equities
rally. The benchmark index lost 1 percent last week, the biggest
decline this year, amid reports showing U.S. payrolls had the
smallest gain in nine months in March while manufacturing and
services industries expanded less than forecast.  Alcoa Results  Income at  S&P 500  companies probably fell 1.8 percent in
the first quarter, the first year-over-year drop since 2009,
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. JPMorgan Chase &
Co., Wells Fargo & Co. and Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. are among S&P
500 companies scheduled to report earnings this week.  Alcoa, the first company in the Dow to release results this
season, reported earnings that exceeded analysts’ estimates
while revenue trailed projections. The company cited lower metal
prices and the impact of smelter curtailments in Spain and  Italy 
for the decline in sales. The shares swung between gains and
losses of 1.3 percent today before closing unchanged at $8.39.  “Analyst estimates might be a little pessimistic at this
point,” Eric Teal, chief investment officer at First Citizens
BancShares Inc., which manages $4.5 billion in Raleigh,  North
Carolina , said in a phone interview. “Earnings will have the
potential to surprise on the upside.”  A report from China showed inflation slowed last month from
a 10-month high. In the U.S., inventories at wholesalers fell
unexpectedly in February as uncertainty about fiscal policy kept
business spending in check.  Fed Stimulus  The S&P 500 has more than  doubled  from its 12-year low in
March 2009, helped by the  Federal Reserve ’s unprecedented bond
purchases and three straight years of profit growth.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in a speech yesterday
that economic conditions were far from where he would like them
to be. The  Federal Open Market Committee  releases minutes of its
March 19-20 meeting tomorrow. After that meeting, Bernanke said
further gains in the U.S. labor market were needed for the Fed
to consider reducing its monetary easing.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange  Volatility Index (VIX) , which
measures the cost of using options as insurance against declines
in the S&P 500, fell 2.7 percent to 12.84 today. The gauge,
known as the VIX, is down 29 percent this year and in March
reached its lowest level since February 2007.  Commodity Rally  Seven of 10 S&P 500  groups  advanced, led by raw-materials
producers.  Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (CLF) , the largest U.S. iron-
ore miner, rallied 8.8 percent to $20.45. Freeport-McMoRan
Copper & Gold Inc., the world’s second-biggest copper miner,
rose 4.1 percent to $33.76.  U.S. Steel Corp. climbed 4.4 percent to $17.99 while
Peabody Energy Corp., a coal producer, added 3.3 percent to
$21.01. China is the biggest user of commodities from copper to
coal.  Technology companies in the S&P 500 added 0.8 percent. The
group has gained 2.8 percent this year, the  worst performance 
among 10 industries. Microsoft, the world’s biggest software
company, jumped 3.6 percent to $29.61 today. Intel, the largest
chipmaker, rallied 3.1 percent to $21.75.  First Solar Inc. soared 46 percent, the most ever, to
$39.35. The solar panel maker forecast 2013  sales (JCP)  and earnings
that exceeded analysts’ estimates as it begins to recognize
revenue for its Desert Sunlight project in southern  California .  J.C. Penney  J.C. Penney tumbled 12 percent to $13.93, its lowest level
since 2001. The CEO’s departure comes after a dismal first year
on the job for Johnson, who arrived with great fanfare after
helping create Apple Inc.’s network of stores. Johnson tried to
transform most of J.C. Penney’s locations into collections of
boutiques and removed sales and coupons in favor of everyday low
prices.  Sales in the year ended Feb. 2 plunged 25 percent to $13
billion, the lowest since at least 1987. Ullman, 66, served as
J.C. Penney’s chairman and CEO for about seven years before
Johnson, 54, took over.  Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., the world’s largest corn
processor, dropped 1.8 percent to $32.73 after rival Cargill
Inc. reported a 42 percent decline in quarterly profit amid the
worst U.S. drought since the 1930s. Cargill is the largest
closely held U.S. company.  Herbalife Ltd. slipped 3.8 percent to $36.95. The
nutritional-supplements company said KPMG LLP resigned as its
independent accountant after finding that a partner allegedly
was involved in  insider trading  in its shares.  To contact the reporters on this story:
