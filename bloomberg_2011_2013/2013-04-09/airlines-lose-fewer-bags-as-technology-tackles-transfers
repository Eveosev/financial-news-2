Airlines cut the rate of mishandled
bags in 2012, with transfer flights accounting for less than
half of incidents for the first time in four years as carriers
used new technology to speed transit times and cope with delays.  Some 8.83 bags per thousand people were mishandled, down
from 8.99 in 2011, even as passenger levels rose, airport IT
provider SITA said today. The number of transfer incidents fell
almost 9 percent to 12.5 million, or 48 percent of the total.  “The industry has made a concerted effort to improve
baggage-handling operations in recent years through significant
investment and innovation,” SITA Chief Executive Officer
Francesco Violante said in its ninth annual survey of passenger
bags that are delayed, damaged, pilfered, lost or stolen.  The rate of mishandled bags has fallen 53 percent in the
past six years, saving the industry $2.1 billion annually, SITA
said. Examples of cutting transfer glitches include the
prioritization of handling based on real-time needs at  Spain ’s
 Iberia (IAG) , while Helsinki airport introduced a system that aims to
deliver 30-minute transfers and triggers special measures to
ensure bags from delayed planes reach connecting flights.  Airlines mishandled 26 million pieces of luggage in total
last year at a cost of $2.6 billion, SITA said. Delayed bags
accounted for almost 83 percent of incidents, while 13 percent
were damaged or pilfered and 4.2 percent lost or stolen.  Airport performance, reviewed for the first time this year,
was worst in  Europe , with 10.6 bags per thousand passengers
mishandled at major hubs, compared with 4.17 in  North America 
and just 2.28 in  Asia , SITA’s  Baggage Report 2013  shows.  The cost of mishandled bags per customer slid to 88 cents,
or $1.01 less than in 2007, when the industry’s bill for
compensation and rectification was $4.69 billion, SITA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
