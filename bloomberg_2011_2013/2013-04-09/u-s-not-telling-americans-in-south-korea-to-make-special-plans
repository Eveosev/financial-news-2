The U.S. is not telling American
travelers or businesspeople to leave South Korea after North
Korea urged foreigners there to flee to avoid the dangers of a
potential war.  “There’s no specific information to indicate an imminent
threat,” said State Department Acting Spokesman Patrick
Ventrell, who said that the U.S. hasn’t changed its security
posture and sees the North Korean warning as part of “a pattern
of provocative rhetoric.”   While the State Department and the Obama administration are
taking “all appropriate measures,” Ventrell said, they are
“not encouraging Americans to take any special travel
preparations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
