Armenian police arrested protesters
as opposition leader Raffi Hovhannisyan led demonstrations at
Serzh Sargsyan’s inauguration to a second term as president.  About 2,000 people gathered today near the presidential
palace in the capital, Yerevan, where 10 were detained,
according to a Facebook Inc. post by activist Haykak Arshamyan.
Armen Martirosyan, deputy head of Hovhannisyan’s Heritage party,
was  photographed  by the news.am website flanked by two police
officers with blood on his face.  Hovhannisyan, who lost a February election to Sargsyan by
more than 20 percentage points, was led away by national police
chief Vladimir Gasparyan and about 50 officers to a different
part of the capital, according to Davit Sanasaryan, a
representative for his team. Armen Malkhasyan, a police
spokesman, refused to clarify how many people were arrested,
saying information would be released through the police website.  Thousands of Armenians have joined Hovhannisyan’s call to
challenge the vote tally as opposition groups seek to gain
traction against Sargsyan’s rule. Local observers and non-
governmental organizations registered more than 400 violations
during the elections, with infringements including ballot
stuffing and attempts to vote more than once.  To contact the reporter on this story:
