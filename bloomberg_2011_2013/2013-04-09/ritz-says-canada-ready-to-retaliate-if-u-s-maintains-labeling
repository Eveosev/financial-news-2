Canadian Agriculture Minister Gerry
Ritz said his country is ready to take retaliatory measures if
the U.S. doesn’t remove country-of-origin labeling
provisions on agricultural products.  The World Trade Organization has ruled the provisions, in
force since 2009, violate global trade law.  “Our Government will consider all options, including
extensive retaliatory measures, should the U.S. not achieve
compliance by May 23, 2013, as mandated by the WTO,” Ritz said
in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
