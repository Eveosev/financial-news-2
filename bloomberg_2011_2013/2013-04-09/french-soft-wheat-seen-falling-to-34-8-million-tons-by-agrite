France ’s soft-wheat harvest is
forecast to decline this year after low spring temperatures
delayed plant development, probably hurting yield potential,
farm adviser Agritel said.  Production may fall to 34.8 million metric tons as average
yields are predicted to drop 4 percent below the five-year
average to 6.98 tons per hectare (2.47 acres), the Paris-based
company wrote in an e-mailed report yesterday.  France is the European Union’s biggest wheat grower, and
harvested 35.7 million tons of the grain in 2012, according to
crop office FranceAgriMer. Crop development is behind last year,
with the grain head on 22 percent of soft wheat reaching 1
centimeter (0.4 inch) last week, compared with 86 percent a year
earlier, crop office data show.  “Even if temperatures will climb this week, the vegetative
cycle will be shortened,” Agritel wrote. “Unless weather
conditions are ideal from now until the next harvest, it’s
highly probable the yield potential will be affected.”  March temperatures were an average 7.5 degrees Celsius
(45.5 degrees Fahrenheit) in France, 1.3 degrees lower than
usual, the  Agriculture Ministry  wrote in a report last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
