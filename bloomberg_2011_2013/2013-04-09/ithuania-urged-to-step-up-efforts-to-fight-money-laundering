Lithuania  needs to be more active in
preventing and prosecuting crime related to the illegal movement
of money, the Council of  Europe ’s monitoring body for  money
laundering  and terrorism said.  “Results both in terms of money-laundering convictions and
confiscation of proceeds of crime remain modest,” Strasbourg-
based Moneyval said in a  report  published today. The
authorities’ approach to investigations “does not appear to be
sufficiently proactive.”  While publicly available information suggests criminal
activity such as corruption, smuggling and flows of “dirty
money” from abroad has increased in recent years, Lithuania’s
authorities have been lax in monitoring the situation and slow
to bolster legislation, according to the report.  Some money laundering has probably gone undetected because
of insufficient supervision of non-bank financial institutions
and construction companies, Moneyval wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
