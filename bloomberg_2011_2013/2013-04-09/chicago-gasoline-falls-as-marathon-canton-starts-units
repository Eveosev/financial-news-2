Chicago  gasoline weakened for the
first time in three days after  Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC)  began
starting units at its Canton,  Ohio , refinery following planned
maintenance. Crack spreads narrowed.  The  84,500-barrel-a-day Ohio plant  is bringing units online
after a turnaround that began last month, according to Shane Pochard, a company spokesman based in Findlay, Ohio. The
refinery shut a fluid catalytic cracker and crude unit, and put
the plant on standby for 30 days, he said.  Restart of the units may increase  Midwest production  and
add to the area’s supplies, which the Energy Information
Administration reported at  53.5 million barrels  in the week
ended March 29.  BP Plc (BP) ’s Whiting, Indiana, refinery and Phillips
66’s Wood River,  Illinois , plant, the biggest in the Midwest,
are both conducting planned maintenance.  Conventional, 85-octane gasoline in Chicago, or CBOB,
weakened 0.25 cent to 23.5 cents a gallon below futures on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:35 p.m. Ultra-low-sulfur
diesel gained 0.25 cent to a premium of  8.5 cents  a gallon.  While some refineries seem to be coming out of turnarounds
early, the Midwest, or PADD 2, region is “just getting
started,” said Carl Larry, a broker with Atlas Commodities LLC
in Houston.  Northern Tier Energy LLC’s  St. Paul Park refinery   in
Minnesota plans plans to begin a turnaround this month that will
include the expansion of a No. 2 crude unit, while  Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM) ’s Joliet, Illinois, refinery, is expected to start a
plant-wide shutdown that will last about five weeks. The
refineries have a combined capacity of about 312,000 barrels a
day.  The 3-2-1 crack spread in Chicago, a rough measure of
refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,
 Oklahoma , dropped 6 cents to $24.04 a barrel. The same spread on
the  Gulf Coast  fell 7 cents to $23.82. Based on Light Louisiana
Sweet oil, Gulf refinery margins sank 62 cents to $9.77.  To contact the reporter on this story:
