Osama Bin Laden’s son-in-law, who
served as the now-dead Al Qaeda leader’s chief spokesman, faces
trial Jan. 7 in Manhattan federal court on charges he conspired
to kill Americans before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks,
a federal judge ruled.  Sulaiman Abu Ghayth pleaded not guilty last month to the
charges, which could land him in prison for life if he is
convicted.  Lawyers for both sides yesterday suggested a trial be
delayed until 2014, in part because federal public defenders
said they don’t have the ability to properly defend Abu Ghayth
in such an international case given budget cuts and mandatory
furloughs under so-called sequestration.  U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan said he found it
“extremely troublesome” that such a trial could be delayed by
across-the-board  federal budget  cuts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
