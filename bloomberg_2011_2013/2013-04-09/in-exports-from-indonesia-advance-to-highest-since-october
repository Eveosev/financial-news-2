Refined tin shipments from  Indonesia 
climbed to a five-month high in March as Malaysia and  Singapore 
increased purchases from the world’s largest exporter.  Exports, including tin ingots and solder, jumped 11.3
percent to 9,295.7 metric tons last month from February, data
from the Trade Ministry showed today. That’s the largest
shipment since October when sales reached 11,048.4 tons, and is
8 percent higher than a year earlier, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Rising supplies may weigh on the price of the metal used in
soldering and packaging, which has fallen for two straight
months in London. The metal, which climbed 22 percent last year,
traded 0.3 percent higher at $22,999 a ton on the  London  Metal
Exchange at 1:23 p.m. Jakarta time.  Indonesia shipped tin to 11 countries last month. Shipments
to Singapore, the biggest buyer, rose 14.5 percent to 6,539.2
tons and sales to Malaysia gained 9 percent to 1,059.5 tons, the
data showed. Other destinations include Thailand and  China .
Exports in the first quarter jumped 20 percent to 26,805 tons
from year earlier, the data showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
