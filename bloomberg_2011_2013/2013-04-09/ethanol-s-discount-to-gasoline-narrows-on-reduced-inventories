Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
shrank to a three-week low on reduced inventories of the biofuel
on the East Coast and in the U.S. Gulf.  The spread slimmed 0.89 cent to 44.34 cents a gallon, the
smallest difference between front-month contracts since March
19. An Energy Information Administration report last week showed
stockpiles on the East Coast were 6.2 million barrels, 33
percent lower than a year ago and inventories in the U.S. Gulf
were down 35 percent.  “In the Gulf and New York they may be short gallons,”
said Mark Ruyack, a manager at StarFuels Inc., a Jupiter,
Florida-based brokerage. “It’s showing itself in the price.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery  added 4.2 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $2.499 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 14 percent this year.  Gasoline futures for May delivery rose 3.31 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $2.9424 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Total U.S.  stockpiles  in the week ended March 29 were 17.5
million barrels, near the lowest level since December 2011 and
22 percent lower than a year ago, data from the Energy
Department’s analytical arm show. The agency is set to report
the latest figures tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  Ethanol production has yet to rebound to levels before the
worst drought since the 1930s sent corn prices to a record,
prompting some companies to idle output.  Crush Spread  Corn for May delivery climbed 10.75 cents, or 1.7 percent,
to $6.4425 a bushel today in  Chicago . One bushel makes at least
2.75 gallons of ethanol.  The corn crush spread, representing gains or losses from
turning corn into ethanol and based on May contracts, was 16
cents a gallon, up from 15 cents yesterday. The amount doesn’t
include revenue from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a
byproduct of ethanol production, which can be fed to livestock.  Output of the fuel in the week ended March 29 averaged
807,000 barrels a day, up 4.8 percent from the record low of
770,000 barrels a day on Jan. 25, EIA data show.  Ruyack said ethanol prices are also being supported by a
slower pace of imports from  Brazil , the biggest supplier of the
fuel to the U.S. Ethanol  imports  averaged 49,000 barrels a day
as of March 29, down 60 percent from the October 2012 high of
122,000 barrels, according to EIA.  Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo  fetched $2.28 a gallon last week,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Cash Market  In cash market trading, ethanol in New York jumped 10.5
cents to $2.69 a gallon, the highest price in more than two
weeks, while the fuel climbed 7 cents to $2.62 in the U.S. Gulf,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol in Chicago rose 6.5 cents to $2.56 a gallon and on
the West Coast, the most expensive U.S. hub, prices added 6.5
cents to $2.78.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the U.S. Gulf narrowed 0.5
cent to 16 cents. Chicago’s discount to  New York  widened 4 cents
to 13 cents.  Under a 2007 law, the U.S. is required to use 13.8 billion
gallons of ethanol this year. Compliance is tracked by Renewable
Identification Numbers, or RINs, which are attached to each
gallon of biofuel produced or imported. Once refiners blend the
biofuel into petroleum, they can retain the RIN or trade it to
another party.  RINs Rising  The value of  corn-based ethanol RINs  rose 5.5 cents to 91.5
cents, the highest price since March 11, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Advanced RINs gained 5.5 cents to 95 cents, also
the highest level since March 11.  Ethanol and petroleum interests have argued over the
reasons behind the surge in RINs values and the effect it may
have on gasoline retail prices.  A bipartisan group of members of the  House of
Representatives  plans to introduce legislation to reform the
Renewable Fuels Standard, according to an e-mailed statement
from Representative Bob Goodlatte, a Republican from  Virginia .  Growth Energy, an ethanol lobby, said it’s planning a news
conference to express support for the RFS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
