OAO EuroChem, a Russian producer of
fertilizer, is seeking a loan of as much as $800 million to help
fund investment in potash projects, according to two people with
knowledge of the matter.  Lenders have been asked to propose terms for the facility
which may include secured and unsecured portions, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the terms are
private. The company is seeking a debt maturity of more than
five years and the deal may complete in the second half of the
year, the people said.  EuroChem, owned by billionaire Andrey Melnichenko, is
planning to invest $3.2 billion in its potash business in the
next four years, it said in its 2012  annual report . The Moscow-
based company currently generates most of its revenues from
nitrogen and phosphate operations, according to the report.  The company raised a $1.3 billion five-year loan in 2011,
which pays an interest margin of 180 basis points more than the
London interbank offered rate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Vladimir Torin, a Moscow-based spokesman for EuroChem,
didnâ€™t immediately reply to a telephone call seeking comment on
the financing. Potash is a form of potassium used to strengthen
plant roots and protect against drought.  To contact the reporter on this story:
