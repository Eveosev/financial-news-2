The number of directorships held by
women at the 100  largest U.K. companies  has risen to 17.3
percent, still short of the target of 25 percent by 2015
recommended in a government-commissioned report two years ago.  There are now 169 women holding 194 board seats at
companies in the  FTSE 100 Index (UKX) ,  Cranfield University School of
Management  said in a report published today. The proportion of
female directors is up from 15.6 percent last year. The number
of companies with no women on their board has fallen to seven,
and two thirds have more than one woman on their board.  Business Secretary Vince Cable said while he preferred a
voluntary approach to increasing female representation, he would
be prepared to act if progress slowed.  “Government continues to believe that a voluntary led
approach is the best way forward,” he said in an e-mailed
statement. “But today’s report also serves as a timely reminder
to business that quotas are still a real possibility” unless
the 25 percent target is met.  Burberry Group Plc (BRBY)  had the highest female representation,
with three women directors out of eight. It was also the only
company in the FTSE 100 Index with two female executive
directors. In the FTSE 250 Index, 73 percent of companies had
women on boards, up from 54 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
