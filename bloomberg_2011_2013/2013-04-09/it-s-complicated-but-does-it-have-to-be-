There's something sad about a watch with a lot of complications. There it gleams, massive and precious on the proud owner's wrist, a beacon of unfulfilled aspirations. You think he's ever used the flyback chronometer on his $15,000 stainless steel  IWC Portuguese  or stopped to consult the  moon phase  on his $35,000 gold Breguet?
