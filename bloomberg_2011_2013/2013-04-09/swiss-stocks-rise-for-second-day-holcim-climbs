Swiss stocks  climbed for a second
day after Alcoa Inc. unofficially kicked off the U.S. earnings
season by reporting first-quarter profit that beat estimates.  Holcim Ltd. (HOLN) , the world’s largest cement maker, posted the
best performance on the benchmark index.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) 
and  UBS AG (UBSN)  followed a gauge of European banks higher. Adecco SA,
the biggest supplier of temporary workers, dropped to the lowest
price since Jan. 16 after Credit Suisse downgraded its
recommendation for the stock.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  rose 0.5 percent to 7,726.79 at 9:43
a.m. in Zurich. The gauge slid 2.2 percent last week as data on
U.S. jobs and services industries signaled that the rebound in
the world’s largest economy has slowed. The broader Swiss
Performance Index gained 0.4 percent today.  Alcoa, the largest U.S. aluminum producer, late yesterday
posted first-quarter earnings excluding an income-tax benefit
and other one-time items of 11 cents a share, beating the 8
cent-average analyst forecast. Earnings at companies in the  S&P
500 Index  may drop 1.8 percent in the first quarter, according
to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The number of shares changing hands in companies on the SMI
was 34 percent lower than the average of the past 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  German Exports  German exports in February fell more than economists
forecast, a report showed.  Overseas shipments , adjusted for
working days and seasonal changes, dropped 1.5 percent from
January, when they gained 1.3 percent, the Federal Statistics
Office in Wiesbaden said. Economists in a Bloomberg survey
forecast a 0.3 percent decline.  Holcim climbed 1.6 percent to 72.65 Swiss francs, posting
the best performance on the SMI.  Credit Suisse and UBS, Switzerland’s largest lenders,
advanced 1.9 percent to 24.80 francs and 1.3 percent to 14.30
francs, respectively. A gauge of European banks was the second-
best performer among the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx Europe
600 Index.  Adecco (ADEN)  lost 2.7 percent to 49.06 francs after Credit Suisse
cut the stock to neutral from outperform, meaning investors may
not buy any more shares of the company.  Sonova Holding AG (SOON)  declined 2.5 percent to 109.50 francs
after Hendrik Lofruthe, an analyst at HSBC Holdings Plc, cut the
stock to neutral from overweight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
