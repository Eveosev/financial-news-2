Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Co. (4182)  and
 Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  plan to build a plant to produce methanol and
dimethyl ether in Trinidad and Tobago.  The companies are in the final stages of an agreement with
the government of the Caribbean nation and Neal & Massy Holdings
Ltd., the Japanese companies said in a statement today.  The partners aim to reach a final decision by March and
start commercial operation by March 2017, according to the
statement.  The initial investment for the plant is estimated to be
$850 million, Ryuji Ideno, a spokesman for Mitsubishi Gas
Chemical, said by phone today.  Global demand for methanol, currently 60 million tons a
year, is expected to increase as much as 5 percent annually in
the coming years, according to the statement.  The partners plan to produce 1 million tons of methanol and
100,000 tons of dimethyl ether, the companies said. Methanol is
used as a raw material to make products such as adhesives and
agrochemicals; dimethyl ether can work as a clean energy
substitute for  diesel fuel  in cars and power generation.  To contact the reporters on this story:
