Treasuries advanced on speculation
the  Bank of Japan (8301) ’s plan to double its asset purchases may boost
buying at today’s $32 billion three-year note auction.  Yields on benchmark  10-year securities  dropped to almost
the lowest level since December before the Treasury sells $66
billion of note an bonds at three auctions this week. The yields
traded below 2 percent for the third straight week as Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke signaled in a speech yesterday
that there was room for improvement in the economy, spurring
bets the central bank will maintain asset purchases.  “It would be appropriate for Japanese investors to be
looking at U.S. Treasuries, given where the Japanese government-
bond market is,” said Thomas di Galoma, a managing director at
Navigate Advisors, a brokerage for institutional investors in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “Maybe they are waiting for the auction
process to be able to buy in greater quantities. I wouldn’t be
surprised to see a pretty substantial indirect bid.”  The U.S. 10-year note  yield  declined one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 1.73 percent as of 12:01 p.m. in New
York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The price of
the 2 percent security due in February 2023 fell 3/32, or 94
cents per $1,000 face value, to 102 13/32. The yield dropped to
1.68 percent on April 5, the lowest level since Dec. 12.  The difference between the yield on the 10-year note and
the 30-year bond was 1.18 percentage points today after
narrowing on April 5 to 1.16 percentage points, the lowest since
November.  Note Auction  “We could push through 1.68 percent if the expectations of
 Japan  buying are correct and it trickles into the U.S,” said
Jason Rogan, director of U.S. government trading at Guggenheim
Partners LLC, a New York-based brokerage for institutional
investors.  The three-year notes being sold today yielded 0.34 percent
in pre-auction trading, compared with 0.41 percent at the
previous offering on March 12. The U.S. will sell $21 billion of
10-year securities tomorrow and $13 billion of 30-year bonds on
April 11.  The yield on previously issued three-year notes was 0.33
percent after dropping to 0.30 percent on April 5, the lowest
since Oct. 4.  Japan Buying  Treasuries have returned 0.6 percent this year, including a
0.8 percent gain in April, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Treasuries are set for a third month of gains, the
longest stretch since January 2012, according to the Bank of
America Merrill Lynch’s U.S. Treasury  Index. (SPX)   German bunds gained 1 percent and U.K. gilts rose 1.9
percent this year.  The MSCI All-Country World Index advanced 0.4 percent while
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.2 percent after a 0.9
percent gain yesterday. The dollar declined against the euro and
the yen.  New Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said April 4 the
central bank would double its monthly asset purchases in a bid
to encourage inflation. Japan held $1.12 trillion of U.S.
Treasury debt, Treasury data through January shows.  “Everybody’s waiting to see what’s going to happen as
Japan continues to do QE,” said Michael Franzese, senior vice
president of fixed-income trading at ED&F Man Capital Markets in
New York. “They are searching for yield. The most secure thing
they can go into right now are Treasuries.”  The yield on the 10-year Japanese note was 0.52 percent
today, according to Bloomberg data.  Fed Purchases  “Today the economy is significantly stronger than it was
four years ago, although conditions are clearly still far from
where we would all like them to be,” Bernanke said in a speech
in Stone Mountain,  Georgia .  The Fed is buying government and mortgage debt at a rate of
$85 billion a month in a bid to boost expansion and reduce
unemployment. The central bank purchased $1.57 billion of
securities due between February 2037 and February 2043 today,
according to the New York Fed’s  website .  Bernanke said last month further improvements in employment
are needed for the central bank to consider reducing its record
monetary easing.  The Labor Department will say on Thursday that claims for
jobless benefits dropped to 360,000 in the week ended April 6,
according to the  median estimate  in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists. Applications reached 385,000 in the period through
March 30, the most in almost four months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
