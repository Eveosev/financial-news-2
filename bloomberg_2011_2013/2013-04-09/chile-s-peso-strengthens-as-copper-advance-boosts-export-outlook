Chile’s peso strengthened for a
fourth day, its longest streak of gains in two months, as an
increase in copper prices boosted the country’s export outlook.  The peso rose 0.3 percent to 465.85 per dollar at 10:40
a.m. in Santiago after touching 465.67, the highest intraday
level since September 2011. The currency has gained 1.3 percent
in four days.  “Copper is higher, and that is having an effect on the
 exchange rate  here,” Jose Giraz, an analyst at XDirect Chile
Ltda., said in a telephone interview.  Copper, Chile’s main export, climbed as much as 1.2 percent
in  New York  after a report showed inflation in  China  slowed more
than forecast, easing concern about monetary tightening in the
country. A 24-hour strike at mines operated by Chile’s Codelco,
the world’s largest copper producer, is being closely monitored
for any effects on supply in the market, Royal Bank of Canada
said in a report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
