Timothy Cannon was sentenced to
probation for attempting to use his job overseeing U.S.
government contracts to secure employment with the Gallup
Organization, the opinion polling and consulting services
company.  Cannon, 63, also was ordered to perform 250 hours of
community service by District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in
 Washington .  Jackson said the while she was troubled by the effort
Cannon made to conceal possible employment with Gallup from
other government officials, she was influenced by his otherwise
exemplary record and believed that “the facts of what took
place in this case are an aberration.”  Cannon also has agreed to pay $40,000 to settle a whistle-
blower lawsuit in which he’s a defendant along with Gallup,
pending Justice Department approval. Jackson made paying the
fine a condition of Cannon’s probation.  The criminal case is U.S. v. Cannon, 13-cr-00001, U.S.
District Court, District of Columbia (Washington). The
whistleblower case is U.S. ex rel. Lindley v. The Gallup
Organization, 09-cv-01985, U.S. District Court, District of
Columbia (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
