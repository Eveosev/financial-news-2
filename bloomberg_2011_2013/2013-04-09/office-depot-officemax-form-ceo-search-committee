Office Depot Inc. (ODP)  and  OfficeMax
Inc. (OMX) , which agreed to merge in February, named board members
from both companies to the committee to help choose a chief
executive officer for the combined entity.  Nigel Travis, CEO of Dunkin Brands Group Inc. and an Office
Depot board member, and Jim Marino, an OfficeMax director and
former CEO of Alberto-Culver Co., will co-chair the panel, the
companies said in a statement today.  They will oversee a search that will include both incumbent
CEOs -- Office Depot’s Neil Austrian and OfficeMax’s Ravi Saligram -- as well as external candidates. The committee plans
to name the new chief by the time the transaction closes, which
the companies expect this year.  Saligram and Austrian will oversee the companies’
integration and have named OfficeMax Chief Financial Officer
Bruce Besanko and Office Depot CFO Mike Newman to co-chair the
the process. The companies project $400 million to $600 million
in annual savings by the third year after the merger is
completed.  Office Depot, the second-largest U.S. office-supplies
chain, agreed to buy OfficeMax in February for $1.17 billion to
revive sales and compete with online retailers and larger rival
 Staples Inc. (SPLS)   Office Depot, based in  Boca Raton , Florida, rose 2.1
percent to $3.91 at the close in  New York , while Naperville,
Illinois-based OfficeMax gained 1.9 percent to $11.57.  To contact the reporter on this story:
