French Finance Minister  Pierre Moscovici  announced 60 million euros ($78 million) in grants for
Senegal and said the former West African colony provides good
opportunities for his nation’s companies.  “There is a good future for France in Africa, a good
future for our companies in Senegal,” Moscovici told
journalists late yesterday after meeting with Senegalese
president Macky Sall in the capital, Dakar.  French companies such mobile-phone company Orange France
SA,  Societe Generale (GLE)  and car importer  CFAO (CFAO)  operate in the
nation, which gained independence from France in 1960. About a
fifth of the companies in Senegal are French-owned, while France
is the country’s largest investor, its top supplier of goods and
one of its biggest export markets, Moscovici said.  The 100 billion euros a year in infrastructural investment
that Africa needs provide “a considerable opportunity for us,”
Moscovici said.  Senegal’s $14.3 billion economy is the second-largest in
the eight-member CFA franc zone, after  Ivory Coast . Exports
include phosphates, cement, peanuts, and fish. Mining is
expected boost growth in Senegal to 4.3 percent next year from
3.7 percent in 2013, according to the  International Monetary
Fund .  “It’s true that our market footstep has decreased over
time; that is the effect of globalization and of an offensive
strategy of some of our competitors,” Moscovici said. “We must
not ignore them, we must confront them.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
