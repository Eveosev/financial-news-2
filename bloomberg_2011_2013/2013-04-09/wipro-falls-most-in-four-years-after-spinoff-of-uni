Wipro Ltd. (WPRO)  fell the most in more
than four years in Mumbai trading after India’s third-largest
software-services provider traded for the first time as a
standalone entity following a  spinoff .  Shares fell 12 percent to 393.70 rupees at the close, the
steepest drop since October 2008. The stock was the  biggest
loser  on India’s S&P BSE Sensex, which declined 1.2 percent.  Billionaire chairman  Azim Premji ’s Wipro is trading today
for the first time as a standalone information technology
 company  after the separation of the consumer care, lighting and
engineering businesses. Computer software and products accounted
for about 86 percent of revenue in the year ended March 2012,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The stock fall is accounting for the demerger,” said
Sunil Pachisia, vice president at the Mumbai-based Pratibhuti
Viniyog Ltd. “The scope for further decline is limited as the
outgoing business had moderate revenues.”  The company announced the separation of its Wipro Consumer
Care & Lighting, Wipro Infrastructure Engineering and Medical
Diagnostic Product & Services businesses into a company called
Wipro Enterprises Ltd. in November.  To contact the reporters on this story:
