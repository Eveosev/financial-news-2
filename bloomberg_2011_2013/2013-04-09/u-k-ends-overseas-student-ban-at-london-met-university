The U.K. government  revoked a ban  on
foreign students attending  London Metropolitan University  after
the institution proved it had systems in place to prevent bogus
visa applicants.  The Home Office removed the university’s license to sponsor
visas last August after it failed to address shortcomings
identified by the now defunct U.K. Border Agency. It had not
monitored whether students were turning up to lectures or
checked whether others had leave to remain in the country, the
agency said.  The government said today that a series of inspections
carried out in the last six months “have demonstrated that the
university has made the necessary improvements to its systems
and administration.” London Met will be subject to a yearlong
probation period, during which there will also be a limit on the
number of international students the university can enroll.  “It is in the interest of international students that all
institutions take their immigration responsibilities seriously
and demonstrate that they comply with the rules,” Immigration
Minister Mark Harper said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
