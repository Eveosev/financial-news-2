JKX Oil & Gas Plc (JKX) , an energy
producer active in eastern  Europe , said production will rise as
it focuses on expanding capacity in  Ukraine .  The company will exceed 12,000 barrels of oil equivalent a
day by the end of the year, Chief Executive Officer Paul Davies
said in a telephone interview. Output slipped 8 percent to 8,281
barrels a day in 2012.  JKX shares have slumped more than 40 percent since the
start of 2012 amid delays to a gas project in Russia and falling
output in Ukraine. While the company gets more than 60 percent
of production from Russia, where gas prices are lower, its
investments in Ukraine will increase the ratio coming from that
more profitable market by the middle of next year, Davies said.  “More than 70 percent of our capital expenditure is
focused on Ukraine and our big program in  Russia  is behind us,”
Davies said. “Our reserves and resources grew last year and
will grow again this year.”  JKX said operating profit fell 37 percent to $51.6 million
last year. The shares fell 7.7 percent to 70.5 pence in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
