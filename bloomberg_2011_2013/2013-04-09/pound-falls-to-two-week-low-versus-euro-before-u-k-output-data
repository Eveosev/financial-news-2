The pound strengthened toward a six-
week high against the dollar after U.K. industrial production
increased in February more than economists forecast, boosting
speculation the nation will avoid a triple-dip recession.  Sterling gained for the fourth time in five days versus the
greenback after gauges of manufacturing and retail sales also
improved. The pound has climbed 1.7 percent in the past month,
trimming this year’s decline to 4.5 percent, the second-worst
performer after the yen, according to Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes that track 10 developed-nation currencies. U.K.
government bonds fell after an auction of 10-year securities
attracted the lowest demand since June 2012.  “The production figures seem to have been taken very
well,” said Lee McDarby, head of dealing on the corporate and
institutional treasury desk at Investec Bank Plc in  London .
“Now that sterling has firmly handed its crown of whipping boy
over to the yen, it’s good to see it get a bit of a boost from
good figures. We think that triple-dip recession will be
avoided.”  The pound rose 0.5 percent to $1.5324 at 4:43 p.m. London
time after rising to $1.5363 on April 5, the strongest since
Feb. 20. Sterling fell 0.2 percent to 85.45 pence per euro after
depreciating to 85.60 pence, the weakest since March 25.  U.K. industrial output expanded 1 percent in February,
after dropping 1.3 percent the previous month, the  Office for
National Statistics  said in London. A Bloomberg News survey of
economists predicted an increase of 0.4 percent.  A similar report for the manufacturing industry showed an
increase of 0.8 percent, while the  British Retail Consortium 
said its measure of retail sales rose 1.9 percent in March from
a year earlier.  Gilts Decline  Gilts fell for a second day as signs the economy is
improving damped demand for safer assets.  The 10-year yield climbed four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.74 percent after rising seven basis
points yesterday. The 1.75 percent bond due September 2022 fell
0.375, or 3.75 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 100.08.  The Debt Management Office sold 3.5 billion pounds of
benchmark 10-year securities at a yield of 1.734 percent, down
from 2.147 percent at the previous offering on Feb. 21. That
compares with a record-low auction yield of 1.719 percent set on
July 12. The so-called bid-to-cover ratio dropped to 1.68 from
2.25 in February.  ‘Relative Selloff’  “The relative selloff seen in 10-year gilts in the past
couple of sessions has been supportive at today’s auction,”
Annalisa Piazza, a fixed-income analyst at Newedge Group in
London, wrote in note to clients.  Britain’s economy probably expanded in the first quarter
and avoided a triple-dip recession, according to an estimate
from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.  Gross domestic product rose 0.1 percent, the same pace as
in the three months through February, the institute, whose
clients include the  Bank of England , said in a statement today.  Gilts returned 1.9 percent this year through yesterday
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds gained
1 percent and Treasuries rose 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
