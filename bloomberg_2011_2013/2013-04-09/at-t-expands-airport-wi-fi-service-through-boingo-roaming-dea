AT&T Inc. (T) , the largest U.S.
telephone company, agreed to a roaming deal with  Boingo Wireless
Inc. (WIFI)  giving AT&T subscribers access to Wi-Fi hot-spot coverage
in major airports around the world.  AT&T customers who sign up for global data packages will be
able to use the Boingo airport networks, according to a
statement. Under the deal, Boingo subscribers can also log on to
AT&T’s collection of Wi-Fi hot spots throughout the U.S.,
including airports, restaurants and sports arenas.  The arrangement is effective immediately and allows AT&T’s
global-data subscribers to use as much as 1 gigabyte of Wi-Fi
data service each month without extra charges. Boingo said its
Wi-Fi network reaches 1.5 billion customers a year worldwide.  Boingo, based in  Los Angeles , climbed 4.1 percent to $6.12
at the close in New York. Dallas-based AT&T gained less than 1
percent to $37.76.  To contact the reporter on this story:
