Retail gasoline prices  in the U.S.
dropped to the lowest for this season in three years after crude
futures capped the biggest weekly drop in six months.  Regular, unleaded gasoline at the pump declined 3.7 cents,
or 1 percent, to $3.608 a gallon, the U.S. Energy Information
Administration said on its website yesterday. Prices fell in
every region of the country except for the Rocky Mountain area,
according to the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm.  Retail gasoline prices have retreated for six straight
weeks and are 33.1 cents a gallon below year-earlier levels.
Oil, which accounts for about two-thirds of the cost of the
motor-fuel, declined 4.7 percent last week, the biggest loss
since the period ended Sept. 21.  Gasoline “probably has another 6 or 7 cents a gallon to
fall in the short-term as the decline in crude prices last week
flows through from refining operations,”  James Williams ,
president of energy consulting firm WTRG Economics in  London ,
 Arkansas , said by telephone yesterday. “The drops should
continue for several days to a week.”  West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery climbed 66
cents, or 0.7 percent, to $93.36 a barrel on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange yesterday, the first gain in four days.
Prices were at $93.46 a barrel today.  Crude stockpiles in the U.S. increased 0.7 percent to 388.6
million barrels in the seven days ended March 29, the highest in
more than 22 years, the EIA said April 3. They probably added
another 1.5 million barrels, or 0.4 percent, last week,
according to the median of eight analyst estimates before the
agency’s next report tomorrow.  Refinery Maintenance  Gasoline supplies slipped 0.3 percent in the week ended
March 29 to 220.7 million barrels, the EIA data showed. They
probably slid another 1.8 million barrels, or 0.8 percent, to
218.9 million last week, according to the Bloomberg survey.  A monthlong maintenance turnaround at  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s
200,700-barrel-a-day Chalmette refinery in  Louisiana  took about
a week longer than expected and was scheduled to begin restoring
production late last week, a person with direct knowledge of the
work said April 3.  Motiva Enterprises LLC’s 600,000-barrel-a-day Port Arthur
refinery in Texas, the largest in the U.S., will keep a crude
unit shut for another week of repairs, two people familiar with
operations there said April 3. The equipment was taken out of
service in mid-February for what was originally estimated to be
a 38-day turnaround.  Gasoline futures for May delivery gained 4.57 cents to
settle at $2.9093 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
yesterday. Prices rose to $2.9134 today.  Gulf Coast Slide  Retail gasoline prices fell the most yesterday on the U.S.
Gulf Coast, where they dropped 4.6 cents to $3.434 a gallon.
Gasoline only rose in the Rocky Mountain region, climbing 2.6
cents to $3.523 a gallon.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) ’s 98,000-barrel-a-day Commerce City
refinery in  Colorado  shut a crude unit for about a week of
repairs on a tower, a person with direct knowledge of the work
said March 21. The refinery reported unit startups on April 1, a
notice to state regulators shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
