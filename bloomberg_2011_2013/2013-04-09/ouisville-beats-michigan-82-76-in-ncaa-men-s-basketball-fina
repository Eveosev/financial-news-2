The University of Louisville
defeated the University of Michigan 82-76 to end a 27-year wait
for its third national championship in men’s college basketball.  Rick Pitino  becomes the first coach in college basketball
history to win the National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament at two different schools, following his 1996 title at
 Kentucky .  Louisville entered the tournament as the favorite of Las
Vegas oddsmakers and was the only top seed from the four regions
to advance to the Final Four.  After losing reserve guard Kevin Ware to a broken leg
against Duke, the Cardinals reached the title game at the
Georgia Dome in Atlanta after overcoming a 12-point second-half
deficit against Wichita State. The win sent Louisville into the
championship game for the first time since 1986, when it last
won the national title.  The Cardinals end the season with a school record 35 wins
in 40 games and on a 16-game winning streak.  The Wolverines have now lost three times in the final since
claiming their only national title in 1989.  Michigan  also lost
in 1992 and 1993, when the so-called Fab Five recruiting class
of Chris Webber, Jalen Rose, Juwan Howard, Jimmy King and Ray
Jackson were freshmen and sophomores.  Tomorrow, Louisville goes against  Connecticut  in the final
of the women’s NCAA basketball tournament.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
