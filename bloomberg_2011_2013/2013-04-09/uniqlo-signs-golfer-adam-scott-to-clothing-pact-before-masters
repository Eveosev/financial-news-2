Fast Retailing Co. (9983) , Asia’s largest
apparel retailer, added the first golfer to its portfolio of
Uniqlo brand ambassadors by signing world No. 7  Adam Scott  to a
multi-year contract.  Scott, the winner of 20 golf tournaments including eight on
the U.S. PGA Tour, will wear Uniqlo apparel in all events
starting with this week’s  Masters Tournament  at Augusta National
Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia, Fast Retailing said in a
statement today without giving financial details.  The agreement with the 32-year-old Australian gives Uniqlo
additional global brand exposure as Scott joins top-ranked
tennis player Novak Djokovic and Kei Nishikori, the world No. 16
from Japan, in wearing Uniqlo clothing during competition.  “Given its widespread following worldwide and
accessibility regardless of age, golf is a good match for us,”
Fast Retailing Chief Executive Officer Tadashi Yanai said in the
statement.  Under terms of the agreement, Scott will also take part in
a range of promotional activities, including a global polo-shirt
campaign starting later this month, Fast Retailing said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
