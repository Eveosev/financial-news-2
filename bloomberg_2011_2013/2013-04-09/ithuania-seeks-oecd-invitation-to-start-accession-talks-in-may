Lithuania is competing for one of
the invitations to start accession talks that the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development is expected to issue in
May, President Dalia Grybauskaite said.  “Joining the OECD would make Lithuania more attractive to
foreign investors, improve our debt ratings and reduce borrowing
costs,” Grybauskaite said today after a meeting in Oslo with
OECD Secretary-General  Angel Gurria , the president’s office in
Vilnius said in an e-mailed statement.  The Paris-based group of the world’s wealthiest nations,
which is dedicated to promoting global economic development,
currently includes 34 member states. It last issued invitations
to start accession talks in 2007 to  Chile ,  Estonia ,  Israel ,
Russia and Slovenia. All but Russia completed talks and joined
the organization in 2010.  Lithuania, with one of Europe’s fastest growing  economies ,
already meets the technical criteria for membership and now
needs political backing from the annual meeting of the OECD
Ministerial Council in May, according to Grybauskaite.  Colombia and Latvia are the other countries with the best
chances of getting an invitation to start OECD accession talks
this year, Jovita Neliupsiene, the Lithuanian president’s
foreign policy adviser, said by phone in Vilnius.  To contact the reporter on this story:
