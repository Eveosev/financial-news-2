A  Sterling Bancorp (STL)  shareholder sued
to block a proposed $344 million takeover by Provident  New York 
Bancorp, saying the purchase price undervalues the company.  Provident New York Bancorp agreed to acquire New York-based
Sterling on April 4 in an all-stock deal, joining a list of U.S.
lenders pairing up in the face of stiffer rules and  capital
requirements .  Provident shareholders will own 53 percent of the combined
company, which will be rebranded Sterling National Bank,
Montebello, New York-based Provident said in a statement. The
deal should be completed in the fourth quarter.  Allen Altman, in a lawsuit filed today in New York State
Supreme Court in Manhattan, accuses Sterling’s board of failing
to secure an adequate price for investors and seeks to proceed
on behalf of a class of Sterling shareholders.  “The intrinsic value of the company’s common stock is
materially in excess of the amount offered in the proposed
transaction, and the process by which the proposed transaction
was completed is unfair to the class,” he said in the filing.  Tricia Hrotko, a spokeswoman for Sterling, said in an e-
mail that the company doesn’t comment on pending litigation as a
policy.  The case is Altman v. Sterling Bancorp, 651263/2013, New
York State Supreme Court ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
