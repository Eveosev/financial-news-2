German and Spanish pig prices were
stable this week, while rising prices in the Netherlands and
 Belgium  may signal an upward trend for European Union hogs,
industry group Interessengemeinschaft der Schweinehalter
Deutschlands e.V. reported.  Hog prices in  Germany , the EU’s biggest producer, were
1.626 euros ($2.09) a kilogram (2.2 pounds) for a seventh week,
while in Spain pigs were 1.818 euros a kilogram for a fifth
week, Damme, Germany-based ISN wrote in an online  report  today.
Dutch prices climbed to 1.566 euros from 1.557 euros.  Pork accounts for about half of meat consumption in the EU.
Average consumption of pork in the 27-nation bloc is forecast to
fall to 40.1 kilograms per person this year from 40.5 kilograms
in 2012, the EU reported last month.  “The slaughter-pig market in  Europe  at the start of the
new butchering week shows cautious first signs of the turnaround
long awaited by producers,” ISN wrote. “The clear price
increase is still absent.”  Belgian prices advanced to 1.581 euros a kilogram from
1.569 euros, while hogs were unchanged in Denmark, Austria and
Ireland. In  France , the EU’s third-biggest pig producer, prices
slipped for a third week to 1.653 euros a kilogram from 1.671
euros, while in Italy they fell to 1.627 euros from 1.715 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
