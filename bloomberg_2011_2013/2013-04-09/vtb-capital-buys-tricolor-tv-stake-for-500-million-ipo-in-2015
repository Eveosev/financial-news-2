VTB Capital, an investment arm of
 Russia ’s second-biggest lender, bought an undisclosed stake in
satellite-television provider Tricolor TV, seeking to prepare it
for an initial public offering, the companies said in a
statement today.  Tricolor will be ready for a public share sale in 2015, Tim Demchenko, head of private equity at Moscow-based VTB Capital,
said in a telephone interview. The company may be worth more
than $1.5 billion by then, while the offering value may be about
$500 million, he said.  Tricolor’s sales rose 43 percent last year to 6.3 billion
rubles ($202 million), while revenue per user was about $23, the
company said it January. Tricolor has about 9.1 million paying
customers. It may increase subscribers to as many as 20 million
in the future and boost profitability, Demchenko said.  Gazprom-Media announced a planned acquisition of Tricolor
in 2009 and that deal failed,  Vedomosti  reported in November.  Anastasia Sokolovskaya, a spokeswoman for Tricolor,
declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
