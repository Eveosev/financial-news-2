Gold rose to a one-week high and
silver jumped the most since January on speculation that central
bankers in major economies will take more steps to bolster their
economies, boosting demand for the metals as stores of value.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled in a
speech yesterday that the economy has room for improvement.
Government data showed today that China’s inflation in March
eased more than forecast from a 10-month high, reducing pressure
on policy makers to tighten credit. The  Bank of Japan  last week
announced stimulus measures.  “Gold is finding support from what Bernanke said and
expectations of easing in China,”  Frank Lesh , a trader at
FuturePath Trading in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview.  On the Comex in New York, gold futures for June delivery
climbed 0.9 percent to settle at $1,586.70 an ounce at 1:38 p.m.
Earlier, the price reached $1,590.10, the highest for a most-
active contract since April 2.  Silver futures for May delivery increased 2.7 percent to
$27.881 an ounce on the Comex, the biggest gain since Jan. 30.  In 2012, gold advanced 7 percent, the 12th straight annual
gain, as nations from the U.S. to  China  pledged more stimulus.
The price has declined 5.3 percent this year as the dollar
gained 3.2 percent against a basket of six major currencies and
investors sold holdings in exchange-traded products backed by
the metal.  Today, Deutsche Bank AG cut its 2013 gold forecast by 12
percent to $1,637. In a report, the bank cited rising U.S. real
interest rates and signs that a “long-term uptrend” for the
dollar will curb bullion demand.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
July delivery rose 1 percent to $1,553.10 an ounce. The price
climbed for the third straight session, the longest rally in two
months.  Palladium futures for June delivery advanced 0.4 percent to
$733 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporters for this story:
