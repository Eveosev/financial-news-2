(Corrects month in headline.)  France â€™s trade deficit widened in
February as exports dropped more quickly than imports.  The trade deficit was 6.01 billion euros in the month,
compared with 5.65 billion euros in January, the customs office
said today in an e-mailed statement. The figures included the
shipment of 25 Airbus aircraft in February, up from 18 in
January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
