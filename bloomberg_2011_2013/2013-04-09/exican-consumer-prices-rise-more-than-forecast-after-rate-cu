Mexican consumer prices rose more
than analysts forecast in March, pushing annual inflation above
the target range for the first month since November and
bolstering analysts’ calls for  interest rates  to remain on hold.  Prices climbed 0.73 percent, the national statistics agency
said today, lifting annual inflation to 4.25 percent from 3.55
percent in February. Analysts had expected prices to rise 0.69
percent, according to the median of 17 estimates in a Bloomberg
survey. Core prices, which exclude energy and agriculture costs,
rose 0.30 percent, compared with the 0.35 percent forecast by 16
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The central bank cut its benchmark rate by half a point to
a record-low 4 percent on March 8, with policy makers
forecasting that inflation would slow toward 3 percent after
rising temporarily. It was the first rate cut in four years and
came as inflation breached the 2 percent to 4 percent target
range in early March as a frost drove up farm prices.  “Certainly, we’ve had some transitory shocks that we see
diminishing soon,” Carstens said April 5. “The internal and
external environment allows us to presume that we’re going to
converge on 3 percent, the inflation target, and we can do it
with a lower rate.”  Yields on fixed-rate  government bonds  due December 2013
rose two basis points to 4.04 percent at 8:18 a.m. in Mexico
City. Inflation-linked bond yields maturing in 2013 fell 2 basis
points to 1.23 percent. The peso strengthened 0.6 percent to
12.1241 per  U.S. dollar  and has appreciated 5.4 percent this
year, the most of 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
