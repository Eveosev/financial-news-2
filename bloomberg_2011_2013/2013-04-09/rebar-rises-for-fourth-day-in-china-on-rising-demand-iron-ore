Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  advanced for a fourth session, supported by higher raw
material costs and as a seasonal increase in construction
activity lifted demand for the building material.  The contract for October delivery rose as much as 0.7
percent to 3,861  yuan  ($622) a metric ton on the Shanghai
Futures Exchange, before trading at 3,845 yuan at 10:30 a.m.
Futures have lost 3.6 percent this year.  Construction activity is gathering pace as temperatures
rise across  China , Zheng Ge, analyst at Wanda Futures Co., said
by phone from Beijing today. Higher demand for the raw material
used in construction may help reduce inventories, he said. Spot
 iron ore  at Tianjin port gained 1.3 percent to $137.60 a dry ton
yesterday, according to The Steel Index Ltd.  “There are some traders who want to buy at the moment to
prepare for the onset of peak season” Zheng said. “There’s
also some early sign of recovery in risk appetite from investors,
which may benefit industrial commodities such as rebar in the
short term.”  The average spot  price  of rebar increased 0.2 percent to
3,638 yuan a ton yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
