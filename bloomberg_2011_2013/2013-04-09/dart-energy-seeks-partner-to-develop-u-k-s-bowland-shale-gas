Dart Energy Ltd. (DTE) , a coal-bed methane
and shale gas explorer in Australia, Asia and Europe, is looking
for a partner to develop its Bowland acreage in the U.K. as the
government prepares tax breaks for drillers.  Dart is “actively seeking appropriate partner or partners
to develop the Bowland shale gas position,” the Sydney-listed
company said in a presentation. “U.K. government policy is now
firmly in place to support unconventional gas development.”  The British government said last month it would offer a
“generous new tax regime” to encourage drillers as it seeks to
boost domestic energy resources to counter a decline in North
Sea oil and gas production.  Dart has conducted an independent assessment of gas-in-
place of as much as 110 trillion cubic feet, according to the
presentation. Cuadrilla Resources Ltd., a U.K.-based shale
explorer, has said its licenses in the Bowland Basin in
northwest England may hold 200 trillion cubic feet of gas.
That’s more than  Iraq  has in its reserves.  Cuadrilla was in “advanced” talks to sell a stake in its
shale operations, partner  AJ Lucas Group Ltd. (AJL)  said in February.
Total SA and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  are considering investing in
U.K. shale drilling, both companies have said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
