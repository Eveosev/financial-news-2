The half-brother of unbeaten
racehorse Black Caviar sold for an Australian record A$5 million
($5.2 million) at the Inglis Easter Yearling Sale.  The unnamed colt by Redoute’s Choice out of Helsinge was
bought by BC3 Thoroughbreds on the opening day of the sale in
Sydney. The previous national record of A$3 million was held by
colts sold at the  Inglis  sales in 2006 and 2007.  “It’s a huge price but there’s a number of people that are
really keen to get involved with him,” Simon Marshall, BC3’s
equine and industry manager, said in a televised interview.
“We’ll sit down over the table at some stage and have a beer
and put it together. It really is exciting.”  BC3 paid A$2.6 million, a record for a yearling filly at
auction in the southern hemisphere, for a half-sister to Black
Caviar at the Inglis sale 12 months ago.  Black Caviar, the world’s top-ranked thoroughbred sprinter,
will try to extend her perfect racing record to 25 straight
victories on April 13 in the TJ Smith Stakes at Royal Randwick
in Sydney.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
