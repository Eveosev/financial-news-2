Canadian  stocks  rose the most in
more than four months as  raw-materials  producers advanced after
weaker-than-forecast inflation in  China  boosted metals prices.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX)  and Goldcorp Inc. climbed at least 1.5
percent as gold advanced.  Teck Resources (TCK/B)  Ltd. and First Quantum
Minerals Ltd. rallied more than 1.5 percent as copper rose.
Endeavour Silver Corp. surged 8.3 percent as the metal’s price
increased the most since January.  Royal Bank of Canada  and
Toronto-Dominion Bank, the nation’s largest lenders, added more
than 0.5 percent amid better-than-estimated housing data.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 139.49
points, or 1.1 percent, to 12,484.05 at 4 p.m. in Toronto, its
biggest increase since Nov. 19. The benchmark equity gauge
erased its loss for the year. Trading volume was 9.8 percent
lower than the 30-day average.  “The inflation data presents some support that as  China’s
economy  is slowing there is still growth,” Anish Chopra,
managing director and  fund manager  with TD Asset Management Ltd.
in Toronto, said. His firm oversees about C$204 billion ($201
billion). “It’s positive that there’s still demand in the
economy. People were concerned about a significant slowdown in
commodities.”  Consumer prices in China increased 2.1 percent in March
from a year earlier, the country’s statistics bureau said today.
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg forecast a 2.5 percent gain. The
reading fell from February’s increase of 3.2 percent, reducing
pressure on policy makers to tighten credit. China is the
world’s biggest user of industrial metals and Canada’s second-
largest trading partner.  Raw Materials  Investors also weighed first-quarter results from  Alcoa
Inc. (AA)  The largest U.S. producer of aluminum posted earnings that
surpassed analyst estimates while its sales fell short of
forecasts.  Raw-materials stocks increased the most in the S&P/TSX. The
group jumped 2.4 percent for its biggest gain since March 6.
Gold climbed 0.9 percent to settle at $1,586.70 an ounce, copper
added 2.1 percent to $3.4415 a pound, and silver advanced 2.7
percent to $27.881 an ounce, the largest jump since Jan. 30.  Barrick Gold increased 1.5 percent to C$27.15, while
Goldcorp gained 3.1 percent to C$32.93. Turquoise Hill Resources
Ltd., which is developing the Oyu Tolgoi gold deposit in
Mongolia, climbed 6.2 percent to C$6.54.  Teck Resources, Canada’s largest diversified miner, jumped
4.9 percent, the biggest increase since November, to C$29.37.
First Quantum Minerals, a copper miner, rose 1.5 percent to
C$19.24. Endeavour Silver surged 8.3 percent to C$6.37.  Oil Advances  Niko Resources Ltd. surged 14 percent, the biggest gain in
the S&P/TSX, to C$7.14, as oil advanced for a second day. Suncor
Energy Inc.,  Canada ’s largest energy producer, jumped 3.1
percent to C$29.84.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. soared 7.8 percent to C$21
after reporting daily output in the first quarter was close to
the upper end of its target range. Chief Executive Officer
Ronald Pantin said today in a statement that the oil and gas
company will try to cut operating costs by about $8 per barrel
for the rest of the year.  Royal Bank rose 1.2 percent to C$60.17 and TD Bank advanced
0.5 percent to C$81.11, as each snapped a four-day losing
streak.  Canadian  housing starts  unexpectedly increased for a second
month in March and building permits rose in February, evidence
that low borrowing costs are supporting construction.  “Canada’s housing starts exceeded expectations, so that
was great,” Chopra said. “People were concerned about a
slowing Canadian economy, so now we have some positive data
points.”  Agrium Inc. dropped 2.8 percent to C$96.55 after investors
rejected a slate of dissident board nominees promoted by
activist shareholder Jana Partners LLC, which has called for
changes at the Calgary-based fertilizer maker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
