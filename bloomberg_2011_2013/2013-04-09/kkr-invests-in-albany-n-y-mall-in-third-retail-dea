KKR & Co. (KKR)  said it’s part of an
investor group that bought the Colonie Center shopping mall in
 Albany , New York, marking the private-equity firm’s third
acquisition of a retail property.  The 1.3 million-square-foot (121,000-square-meter) mall,
which has more than 113 stores and a 13-screen movie theater,
was renovated in 2007, New York-based KKR said today in a
statement. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.  KKR teamed with the same partners it had for its first
retail deal, the $196 million purchase in April 2012 of Yorktown
Center in a Chicago suburb, said  Kristi Huller , a spokeswoman
for the company. In January, KKR and another partner won the
bidding for the firm’s first outlet center, in Kansas City,
Kansas.  The investor group for the Colonie mall includes the
company’s credit unit,  KKR Financial Holdings LLC (KFN) , as well as
KKR clients, which the firm didn’t identify. KKR’s partner,
Colonie Pacific, is a venture between Pacific Retail Capital
Partners, Collarmele Partners and Peter Fair, a principal of
Continuum Partners.  The new owners plan to invest additional money and will
focus on attracting new tenants, KKR said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
