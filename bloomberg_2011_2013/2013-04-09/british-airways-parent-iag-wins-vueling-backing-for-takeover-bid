British Airways (IAG)  parent IAG won
backing for its bid for  Vueling Airlines SA (VLG)  from the Spanish
discount carrier’s board after raising the offer by 32 percent.  Vueling’s directors recommend that investors accept a
“reasonable” bid of 9.25 euros a share issued on March 27, the
Barcelona-based company said today in a statement. The board had
rejected an earlier approach valued at 7 euros a share.  IAG Chief Executive Officer  Willie Walsh  is seeking control
of profitable Vueling after the London-based group’s Spanish
Iberia unit pushed it to a 23 million-euro ($30 million) loss in
2012. Vueling, in which IAG already owns a 45.85 percent stake,
would remain a standalone unit within Europe’s No. 3 airline.  “Greater integration of Vueling into IAG should provide
advantages and opportunities of interest for the company,”
Vueling said in its stock market filing.  IAG, as London-based International Consolidated Airlines
Group SA is known, is seeking a minimum 4.16 percent more stock
to gain at least a 50.01 percent holding, down from the earlier
90 percent. The bid values Vueling at 277 million euros.  Vueling shares closed 1 cent higher at 9.26 euros in  Madrid 
before today’s announcement, while IAG advanced 1.6 percent to
237.20 pence in  London .  To contact the reporters on this story:
