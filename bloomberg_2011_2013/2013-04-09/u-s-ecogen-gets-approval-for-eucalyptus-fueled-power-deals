U.S. EcoGen LLC , a closely held
developer of biomass-fueled power plants, received approval from
Florida regulators for electricity sales contracts for three
projects expected to enter service in 2019.  NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE) ’s Florida Power & Light utility
received approval to purchase for 30 years the electricity from
the 60-megawatt plants in Okeechobee, Clay and Martin counties,
and the deals may save its customer about $90 million a year,
according to a Florida Public Service Commission  filing . Terms
weren’t disclosed.  The three plants are expected to produce enough energy to
power 30,000 to 50,000 homes a year, the commission said today
in a statement announcing the contract approvals. U.S. EcoGen,
based in Jupiter, Florida, will use eucalyptus as the primary
fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
