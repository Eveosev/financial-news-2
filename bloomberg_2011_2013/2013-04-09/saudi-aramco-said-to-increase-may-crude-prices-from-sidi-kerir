Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the worldâ€™s
largest crude exporter, raised its May official selling price
for Arab Light blend from the Egyptian port of Sidi Kerir,
according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  Saudi Aramco , as the state-run producer is known, narrowed
the discount of Arab Light to $1.65 cents a barrel less than the
Brent weighted average, or BWAVE, posted by the  Intercontinental
Exchange , said the people, who declined to be identified because
the information is confidential. That compares with minus $2.35
for this month.  Aramco also increased the price of its Medium and Heavy
grades to discounts of $2.85 and $4.75 a barrel respectively to
BWAVE while Extra Light was cut to parity to the benchmark from
a 25 cent premium, they said.  The state company already announced prices for its main
four destinations,  Asia , the U.S., Northwest Europe and the
Mediterranean, in an e-mail on April 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
