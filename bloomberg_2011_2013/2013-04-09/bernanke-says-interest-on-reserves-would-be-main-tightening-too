Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the Fed will raise the  interest rate  on excess
reserves as its primary tool for tightening monetary policy
rather than selling assets from its balance sheet.  “The principal tool that we contemplate is the interest
rate paid on excess reserves,” Bernanke said today in response
to audience questions at a conference in Stone Mountain,
 Georgia . During a tightening, money market rates will probably
stay close to the interest rate on excess reserves, he said.  The Fed chairman didn’t comment on the timing of any Fed
effort to withdraw  accommodation .  “We have said in our existing exit principles we may sell
assets in a steady way,” he said. Still, “asset sales are late
in the process and not meant to be the principal tool of policy
normalization.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
