Total SA failed to buy more  North
Sea  Forties crude. The oil producer has bought seven cargoes
since March 27 and has chartered its second tanker this year to
transport the grade to South Korea.  Glencore International Plc (GLEN)  sold a cargo of Russian Urals
grade crude at the smallest discount to Dated Brent in more than
six weeks.  North Sea  Total unsuccessfully bid for Forties for loading April 24
to April 29 at 30 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent,
according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts pricing window. That’s the same discount
as yesterday’s successful trade.  The company booked the supertanker Maersk Noble to carry
280,000 metric tons of Forties on April 17 from Hound Point in
the U.K. to  South Korea , according to reports from Athens-based
Optima Shipbrokers Ltd. and Norwegian PF Bassoe AS. Total’s
Paris-based press office declined to comment today in response
to e-mailed questions seeking information on the booking.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days widened by 9 cents to a discount of 30 cents a
barrel to Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for May settlement traded at $104.78 a barrel on the
ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $104.07 yesterday. The June contract
closed at $104.82 today, a premium of 4 cents to May.  Mediterranean/Urals  Glencore sold Russian Urals crude to  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) 
for loading April 20 to April 24 at $1.95 less than Dated Brent
on a delivered basis to Rotterdam, according to the survey of
brokers monitoring Platts. That was the lowest trade since Feb.
20, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Urals discount to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
narrowed by 5 cents to 70 cents a barrel, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That was the least since Feb. 1. In northwest
Europe, the  discount  was at $2.10 a barrel versus $2.15 at
yesterday’s close.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend dropped 1 cent to $3.49 a
barrel more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
