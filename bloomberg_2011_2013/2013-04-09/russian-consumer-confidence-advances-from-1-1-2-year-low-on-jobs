Russian  consumer confidence  improved
from the lowest level in 1 1/2 years last quarter as the jobless
rate held near record lows.  The  consumer confidence  index rose one point to minus 7
from minus 8 in the final three months of last year, the Federal
Statistics Service in Moscow said in an e-mailed statement
today. The increase came from “positive trends” in all of the
index’s components, according to the statement.  Economic growth in  Russia , which relies on household
spending for about half of its output, slowed to 2.1 percent in
the fourth quarter as sagging domestic demand compounded the
effects of struggling investment and weaker export sales. Policy
makers left their main  interest rates  unchanged this month as
unemployment remains near a record low and inflation holds above
the central bank’s target of 5 percent to 6 percent.  The labor market is a source of optimism, as it “gives
hope for real wages growth,” Vladimir Miklashevsky, an
economist at Danske Bank A/S in Helsinki, said by e-mail before
the release. Still, weaker retail sales would limit gains, as
would higher retail borrowing costs, he said.  Unemployment on a seasonally adjusted level was 5.3 percent
in the first two months of the year, meaning there is little
room for monetary easing, central bank Chairman Sergey Ignatiev
said in a speech April 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
