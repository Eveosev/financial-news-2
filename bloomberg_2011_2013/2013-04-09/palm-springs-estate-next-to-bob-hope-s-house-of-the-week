If you're unable to part with $50 million for  Bob Hope's John Lautner-designed estate , how about another  Palm Springs residence  with its own significant architecture just a few houses away? This  modern  home is located in prestigious  Southridge , a gated enclave of 23 properties including former homes of actors  Steve McQueen  and William Holden, in addition to Hope's iconic home. Designed by Edward Gedding, who worked with many high-profile clients in the 1970s and '80s, the residence sits on 2.25 acres and, like Hope's home, centers around a circular skylight. The current owner picked up the home in 2002 and began a complete renovation, virtually redoing all the surfaces in the home, explains  listing agent  Bill Taylor of  Saxony Real Estate . "He didn't remodel the exterior; it's so classic," Taylor said. "He really enhanced the interior to today's standards." The homeowner's renovation included opening up the floor plan, adding a  bar  and pool table area, as well as enhancing the sitting area. He also added a whopping 40 tons of  Idaho  quartz to the already 660 tons present throughout the structure. The end result is something Taylor believes can't really be duplicated. "The views and the quality, the finishes ... the location of the home: There's just nothing like it," he said. "The homeowner has great taste in what he does. You couldn't replicate the value." A monthly payment on the home would be $34,376,  calculated with today's mortgage rates  and assuming a 20 percent down payment on a  30-year fixed-rate mortgage . Related on  Zillow.com :
