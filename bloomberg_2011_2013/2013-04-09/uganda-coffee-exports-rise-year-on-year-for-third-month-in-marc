Coffee exports from  Uganda , Africa’s
second-biggest shipper of the beans, rose for a third month
year-on-year in March, as exporters bought and released more
stocks.  Exports in March rose 66 percent to 311,290 60-kilogram
(132-pound) bags from 187,592 bags a year earlier, Uganda Coffee
Development Authority, the regulator, said today by e-mail from
the capital Kampala. The beans were valued at $38 million last
month.  Shipments from the East African nation, which sends its
beans mainly to the European Union, U.S.,  Sudan ,  Switzerland ,
India, Australia and Russia, surpassed an earlier forecast
270,000 bags, the agency said. Exports were lower than
February’s 344,760 bags as the main harvest slowed.  Exporters enhanced buying and releasing of stocks last
month, the agency said without providing details. Robusta coffee
fell 2.2 percent to $2,074 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in March,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Shipments in the first half of the 2012-13 season, which
started Oct. 1, climbed 22 percent to 1,644,215 bags from
1,343,136 a year earlier, according to a tally of the authority
figures by  Bloomberg News . The value of exports in the first
half of the season rose to $205.5 million from $202.4 million.  Total exports for the 2012-13 are expected to rise to 3.2
million bags from 2.73 million on a larger crop due to improved
weather, according to the authority.  The East African nation, the continent’s second-biggest
grower and exporter of the beans after  Ethiopia , consumes about
3 percent of its annual crop, the Africa Fine Coffee Association
says.  Robusta beans, used in espressos and instant drinks,
accounted for 70 percent of Ugandan exports last season,
according to the authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
