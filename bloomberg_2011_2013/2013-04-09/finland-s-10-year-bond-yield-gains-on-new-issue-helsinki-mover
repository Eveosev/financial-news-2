Finland ’s 10-year bond yields rose
the most in more than two months in Helsinki after the Treasury
opened books to sell 4 billion euros ($5.2 billion) in euro-
denominated bonds maturing in 2023.  The yield on Finland’s 1.625 percent bond maturing in 2022
jumped 5.5 basis points to 1.478 percent at 2:07 p.m. local
time, the most since Jan. 28, when it rose by 7 basis points.
One basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Finland’s new bond may be priced today about 2 basis points
below the mid-swap rate, according to a person familiar with the
matter who asked not to be identified on account of not being
authorized to speak about it. The yield on  Germany ’s 1.5 percent
bond maturing in 2023 rose 3.5 basis points to 1.272 percent.  Finland is raising about 7.5 billion euros this year to
plug a budget gap seen by the  Finance Ministry  at 2.3 percent of
gross domestic product. The deficit will narrow to 1.7 percent
next year, the ministry said on March 27.  The Treasury mandated Barclays Plc, Credit Agricole SA,
HSBC Holdings Plc, Nordea Bank AB and Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc to manage the issue.  Finland is the only euro member with a stable AAA rating at
 Standard & Poor’s , Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings.
While Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg also have the top
rating, they all have a negative outlook with at least one
rating company.  To contact the reporters on this story:
