The  International Swaps &
Derivatives Association  said it hired consulting firm  Oliver
Wyman  to make recommendations on how to modify an interest-rate
swap pricing process that is the subject of a U.S.
investigation.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has subpoenaed
 ICAP Plc (IAP)  and as many as 15 dealers related to potential
manipulation of benchmark rate-swap measures, including the so-
called ISDAfix rates, according to people familiar with the
investigation. The rates were created in 1998 by ISDA with the
predecessors of Thomson Reuters Corp. and ICAP.  ISDA, the New York-based industry and lobbying group for
the over-the-counter  derivatives market , participated in a
regulatory review of how the London interbank offered rate is
determined, said Steve Kennedy, an ISDA spokesman. UBS AG, Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc and  Barclays Plc (BARC)  have paid $2.6
billion in fines for rigging Libor rates.  “As part of that process some best practices were
articulated for the setting of these rates,” Kennedy said in a
telephone interview. “We anticipated during that review that
we’d want to do the same thing for ISDAfix.”  A representative for Oliver Wyman didn’t return telephone
calls seeking comment.  The Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times earlier
reported the hiring of Oliver Wyman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
