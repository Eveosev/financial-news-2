William Ackman’s losses on his
investment in J.C. Penney Co. surpassed $650 million as the
shares fell following the departure of Chief Executive Officer
Ron Johnson.  J.C. Penney shares  dropped 12 percent  to $13.95 at 11 a.m.
in New York, bringing paper losses at Ackman’s Pershing Square
Capital Management to about $467 million on the roughly $1
billion that it spent to acquire 39 million J.C. Penney shares,
according to regulatory filings. The New York-based hedge-fund
firm also has partially realized losses of about $192 million on
total return swaps tied to the price of J.C. Penney shares.  Ackman reported in October 2010 that the $13 billion
Pershing Square had acquired a 16.5 percent stake in J.C.
Penney, paying an average of about $25.90 a share. Pershing
Square increased its bet in September 2011 by entering into swap
contracts on an additional 15.9 million J.C. Penney shares. When
the contracts mature, Pershing Square would be required to make
cash payments to the extent the market price of these shares is
less than $26.14 each.  J.C. Penney yesterday ousted Johnson and reinstated his
predecessor Myron E. Ullman III as the department-store chain
seeks to rebound from its worst sales year in more than two
decades. Sales in the year ended Feb. 2 plunged 25 percent to
$13 billion, the lowest since at least 1987.  Ackman, who has made several investments in retailers
through Pershing Square, has seen some bets in the industry fare
poorly. In February 2009, Ackman sent a letter to his clients
telling them that a $2 billion fund he had set up at the time to
invest solely in  Target Corp. (TGT)  had lost 90 percent of its value.
Pershing Square owned 31 percent of Borders Group Inc. when the
bookseller filed for bankruptcy protection in 2011. Ackman
didn’t return calls and an e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
