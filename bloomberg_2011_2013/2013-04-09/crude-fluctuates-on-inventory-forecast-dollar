West  Texas  Intermediate crude rose
the most in two weeks as the dollar weakened against the euro
and the U.S. boosted its 2013 price forecast.  Futures gained 0.9 percent after the dollar slipped to a
three-week low against the euro, raising dollar-denominated
oil’s appeal as an investment alternative.  The Energy
Information Administration , the Department of Energy’s
statistical arm, increased its WTI estimate for the year by 2.2
percent in a monthly report. May WTI rebounded after failing to
breach $91.84, the March 21 intraday low.  “You have a weaker dollar today, and the currencies are
really leading the way,” said Bill Baruch, a senior market
strategist at Iitrader.com in  Chicago . “We got a bit of a boost
from the DOE report. Crude did not make a new low below $91.84,
and it’s building up momentum.”  WTI oil for May delivery advanced 84 cents to settle at
$94.20 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . It was the
biggest rally since March 26. Prices are up 2.6 percent this
year. Trading was 8.5 percent above the 100-day average for the
time of day at 4:45 p.m.  Prices pared gains after the  American Petroleum Institute 
said inventories grew 5.06 million barrels last week to 390.7
million, the biggest stockpile since July 1981. The May contract
rose 59 cents to $93.95 in electronic trading at 4:45 p.m. It
was $94.08 before the API report was released at 4:30 p.m.  Brent crude  for May settlement rose $1.57, or 1.5 percent,
to $106.23 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Trading was 33 percent above the 100-day average for
the time of day.  Dollar Weakens  The dollar fell as much as 0.7 percent to $1.3103 per euro,
the lowest level since March 15. The currency has dropped since
an April 5 report from the Labor Department showed a slowdown in
U.S. jobs growth, spurring speculation that the  Federal Reserve 
will extend its bond-buying stimulus program, known as
quantitative easing.  “The dollar is weaker and that’s helping oil,” said Tariq Zahir, a New York-based commodity fund manager at Tyche Capital
Advisors.  WTI crude will average  $93.92 a barrel  this year, up from
the March estimate of $91.92, the EIA said today in its monthly
Short-Term Energy Outlook. Prices averaged $94.12 last year.  Brent, the benchmark grade for more than half the world’s
crude, will average $107.96 a barrel in 2013, down 37 cents from
last month’s forecast. Brent’s premium to WTI will average
$14.04 this year. The spread was $17.53 a barrel last year,
according to the report.  “We raised our WTI forecast to reflect the narrowing
spread with Brent,” said  Tancred Lidderdale , an economist with
the EIA in  Washington  who helped write the report.  Goldman Recommendation  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  recommended that investors buy
September WTI futures and sell the same-month Brent contract,
according to a report today. The bank revised its previous
suggestion for a similar trade using June contracts.  Crude output in Texas and  New Mexico  has been lower than
expected over the past three months, reducing the risk that the
Texas Gulf Coast will be “oversaturated” with light crude and
depress WTI prices, Stefan Wieler, an analyst at Goldman in New
York, said in the report.  The spread based on front-month contracts widened to $12.03
a barrel from $11.30 yesterday, the narrowest gap since June 22
on a settlement basis.  “The pressure is to the downside for the Brent-WTI
spread,” said Jacob Correll, a Louisville, Kentucky-based
analyst at Summit Energy Inc., which manages more than $20
billion in companies’ annual energy spending. “In the longer
term, we do expect it to narrow.”  WTI fell earlier on a forecast that crude  inventories 
probably gained for a 12th time last week.  U.S. Inventories  Crude stockpiles probably grew by 1.5 million barrels to
390.1 million in the week ended April 5, after reaching the
highest level since July 1990 in the previous week, according to
the median of 11 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg survey before
an EIA report tomorrow.  Futures dropped the most in six months last week as
supplies grew and  production  stayed above 7 million barrels a
day, the most since 1992. Inventories have risen every April
since 1999.  “We are still in the build season, and the very strong
domestic production level is adding further fuel to this,”
Correll said.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI crude options
expiring in May was 19.2 percent, down from 20 percent
yesterday. The figure has slipped from 24.7 percent on Feb. 21.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 502,416
contracts as of 4:47 p.m. It totaled 471,677 contracts
yesterday, 18 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.76 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
