The  European Central Bank  is looking
“especially” at non-standard measures to help boost economic
growth, Governing Council member Josef Bonnici said.  “We do look at all possible options, especially with
regard to non-standard measures,” Bonnici, who heads Malta’s
central bank, said in an interview today in Valletta, the island
nation’s capital. “There is considerable heterogeneity in the
euro zone and therefore there must be a wide array of policies
that are considered from time to time.”  ECB President  Mario Draghi  said last week that the central
bank is considering using both standard and non-standard policy
tools to stimulate the economy, which is mired in recession amid
the sovereign debt crisis. Bonnici said that while an interest-
rate cut is under consideration, such a move may have only a
small impact.  “Interest-rate changes are part of the standard policy
tools that the ECB has available, so it is quite natural that it
is considered from time to time,” he said. “However, rates are
already very low, so the marginal gain may be small.”  The ECB’s  benchmark rate  is at a record low of 0.75 percent
and its deposit rate is at zero.  Bonnici said Malta’s banking system is “sound and robust
with high solvency, profitability and liquidity,” and there are
“no signs of any speculative activity.”  “Malta’s economic fundamentals also remain strong on the
back of positive performance throughout the past years,
notwithstanding a delicate external economic environment,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
