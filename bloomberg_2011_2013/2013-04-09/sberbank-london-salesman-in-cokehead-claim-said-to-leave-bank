David Longmuir, head of equity sales
at OAO Sberbank’s London unit, agreed to step down after being
accused of referring to a colleague as “Ms. Cokehead,”
according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  Colleagues on the equity sales desk, all men, created a
hostile work environment and displayed “a demeaning and
offensive attitude to women,” Svetlana Lokhova alleged in
documents from her U.K. employment tribunal claim against
Sberbank CIB (UK) Ltd. Lokhova took a leave of absence in
January 2012 and hasn’t returned since.  Lokhova accused Longmuir of sending e-mails to clients
saying they were “awaiting arriving of Ms. Cokehead,” and
“they’ve hired mad Svetlana to do equity sales,” according to
her claim. She had left what was then Troika Dialog’s London
operation in 2010 and rejoined in 2011. Sberbank acquired Troika
in January 2012.  Longmuir, 50, will leave the bank on April 12 by mutual
consent, said the people, who asked not to be named as the
information isn’t public. Longmuir declined to comment today
when reached by Bloomberg on his office phone.  Sberbank CIB will defend itself and is “confident that it
has acted appropriately and lawfully,” Paul Marriott, a
spokesman, said today in an e-mailed statement, declining to
comment further because the matter is subject to an employment
tribunal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
