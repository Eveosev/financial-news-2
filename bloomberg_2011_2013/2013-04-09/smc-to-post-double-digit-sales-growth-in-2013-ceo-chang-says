Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Co., the world’s largest contract producer of chips, projects
that sales will rise at a percentage in the teens this year,
Chief Executive Officer  Morris Chang  said.  Revenue at so-called fabless chipmakers, or chip-design
companies that hire TSMC and its rivals to manufacture their
products, will expand about 9 percent, while the semiconductor
market as a whole will grow at about 4 percent, Chang said at an
event today in San Jose, California.  “Last year was not a very good one,” said Chang,
referring to industrywide sales, which he said shrank 2 percent
to 3 percent in 2012. “This year we think will be better.”  TSMC’s revenue increased 19 percent in 2012. The Hsinchu,
Taiwan-based company is outperforming the majority of the chip
industry as its plants churn out semiconductors for companies
such as  Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM)  and  Broadcom Corp. (BRCM) , which supply the key
components of smartphones and tablets.  In January, TSMC said first-quarter revenue would be NT$127
billion ($4.23 billion) to NT$129 billion. That compares with
the NT$124 billion average analyst estimate compiled by
Bloomberg at the time.  TSMC’s fourth-quarter profit jumped 32 percent as demand
for mobile devices from Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co.
