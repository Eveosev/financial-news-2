Care.com Inc., a website used to
find local babysitters and caregivers, is hiring former  IRobot
Corp. (IRBT)  executive  John Leahy  as chief financial officer ahead of a
possible initial public offering.  Leahy spent more than four years as CFO of IRobot, the
maker of Roomba automated cleaning devices, after holding other
executive positions at publicly traded companies. Leahy’s
experience is helpful as Care.com looks at future financing
events, said Chief Executive Officer Sheila Lirio Marcelo.  With more than $100 million in funding, Care.com is looking
at various options, Marcelo said. A provider of online services
that lets consumers find local care for children, seniors and
pets, Care.com has been expanding globally and making
acquisitions, helping it to double revenue last year.  “John brings a level of experience and expertise in order
to help our organization scale and continue to grow,” Marcelo
said in an interview. “We’re just Chapter 2 of a very long
book. So we’ve got a long way to go to fulfill the vision we
have in mind.”  Marcelo declined to comment on specific plans concerning an
IPO or acquisition.  Care.com raised $50 million in funding in 2012 in a
financing round led by  Institutional Venture Partners , bringing
its total funding to $111 million.  “It’s a great brand with lots of runway ahead of it,”
Leahy said in an interview. “This is the first time in my
career that I’ve had the opportunity to work with a late-stage
firm and really help the firm or the company get to the next
level.”  -- Editors: Reed Stevenson, Jillian Ward  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
