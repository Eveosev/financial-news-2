Boeing Co. (BA)  will invest an additional
$1 billion at a South Carolina 787 Dreamliner plant over eight
years and create at least 2,000 jobs as it expands output of the
composite-plastic aircraft thatâ€™s now grounded.  The investment includes the purchase of 320 acres of land
for expansion, added capacity and an information technology
center, Candy Eslinger, a Boeing spokeswoman in North
Charleston, South Carolina, said today in a telephone interview.  Boeing, based in Chicago, will receive state incentives of
$120 million if it meets the spending plan, Eslinger said. Since
2009, the Boeing has spent $1 billion and created 6,000 jobs at
the new plant, its first outside of Washington state, Eslinger
said.  The company last week completed testing on a new 787
battery system in an effort to convince the Federal Aviation
Administration to lift an order to ground the Dreamliner after
 lithium-ion batteries  overheated on two separate aircraft in
January.  The spending plan was reported earlier by The Post and
Courier, a newspaper in Charleston,  South Carolina .  To contact the reporter on this story:
