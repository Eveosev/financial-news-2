Drake & Scull International PJSC (DSI) 
shares  surged  to their highest in more than five months amid
speculation the Dubai-based builder may be acquired. The company
said it’s not a target.  The shares climbed 5.15 percent closing at 81.6 fils, the
highest close since Oct. 31. The shares  gained  13 percent in the
six-day winning streak. About 71 million shares traded today,
almost five times the three-month daily average volume,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The benchmark DFM
General Index rose 2.4 percent.  “There are a lot of rumors, some speculation about some
companies being taken over,” said Mohammed Ali Yasin, managing
director of NBAD Securities in  Abu Dhabi . “The rumors have
become more active,” he said. Drake & Scull shares were among
benefiting from the speculations.  Drake & Scull “is not a target of acquisition by anyone
and the rumors aren’t true,” Zeina Tabari, chief corporate
affairs officer said by phone today. Investors could be reacting
to expectations of contract announcements or on optimism about
expected first-quarter earnings, she said.  Four analysts have a buy  recommendation  on the stock, five
say hold and three recommend selling, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
