Treasury bonds fell for a second day
as below-average demand at the government’s $32 billion three-
year note sale weighed on projections for the 10- and 30-year
auctions over the next two days.  The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
the amount with the amount offered, was 3.24, the lowest at a
three-year auction since September 2011, versus a 3.60 average
at the previous 10 sales. Traders had speculated that the  Bank
of Japan (8301) ’s plan to double its asset purchases might boost buying
at the auction. The U.S. will sell $21 billion in 10-year notes
tomorrow and $13 billion in bonds the next day.  “It will be difficult to sell the longer maturities with
the three-year not going as well as expected,” said Paul Montaquila, fixed-income investment officer with BNP Paribas
SA’s Bank of the West and BNP Paribas Securities Corp.  Yields on  30-year bonds  rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.94 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices showed. The 3.125 percent security
due in February 2043 fell 15/32, or $4.69 per $1,000 face value,
to 103 22/32.  The  yield  on the current three-year note was little changed
at 0.33 percent. It touched 0.3 percent on April 5, the lowest
level since Oct. 4.  Benchmark 10-year note  yields  were 1.75 percent after
dropping to 1.68 percent on April 5, the least since Dec. 12.  Ten-year yields traded below  2 percent  for the third
straight week as Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled in a
speech yesterday that there was room for improvement in the
economy, spurring bets the central bank will maintain asset
purchases.  Bidder Results  Treasury volatility as measured by the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch  MOVE index  was 52.72 basis points today, the
lowest level since Dec. 11. The gauge, which tracks the outlook
for swings in  U.S. government debt  rates, has averaged 64 basis
points over the past year.  The three-year securities sold today drew a  yield  of 0.342
percent, compared with an average forecast of 0.341 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of 10 of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary
dealers.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 16.2 percent of
the notes, versus a record-high 26.9 percent in February and an
average of 19 percent at the past 10 auctions.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 19 percent of the notes, compared with
an average of 26.6 percent at the past 10 sales. They bought a
record-low 18 percent at the Feb. 12 offering.  ‘Go Longer’  “No one is excited about the front end of the market,”
said Tom Tucci, managing director and head of Treasury trading
in  New York  at CIBC World Markets Corp. “It’s at one of the
richest levels historically so that doesn’t give it much flavor.
They may go longer out the curve and pick up duration.”  Last month’s sale of the debt yielded 0.411 percent, while
the record-low yield of 0.327 percent was reached in December.  Three-year notes have gained investors 0.2 percent this
year, compared with a return of 0.6 percent in 2012, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The broader Treasuries
market has returned 0.5 percent this year after gaining 2.2
percent last year.  The Treasury Department is selling $66 billion in notes and
bonds this week. The sales will raise $6.7 billion of new cash,
as maturing securities held by the public total $59.3 billion,
according to the Treasury.  Japan QE  New Bank of  Japan  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said April 4 the
central bank would double its monthly asset purchases in a bid
to encourage inflation, a form of quantitative easing, or QE.
Japan held $1.12 trillion of U.S. government debt, Treasury data
through January shows.  “Everybody’s waiting to see what’s going to happen as
Japan continues to do QE,” said  Michael Franzese , senior vice
president of fixed-income trading at ED&F Man Capital Markets in
New York. “They are searching for yield. The most secure thing
they can go into right now are Treasuries.”  The yield on the 10-year Japanese note was 0.53 percent
today, according to Bloomberg data.  The Fed is buying government and mortgage debt at a rate of
$85 billion a month in a bid to boost expansion and reduce
unemployment. The central bank purchased $1.57 billion of
securities due between February 2037 and February 2043 today,
according to the New York Fed’s website.  The Labor Department will say on April 11 that claims for
jobless benefits dropped to 360,000 in the week ended April 6,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists. Applications reached 385,000 in the period through
March 30, the most in almost four months.  To contact the reporters on this story:
