Most Japanese stocks fell amid
concern  shares  have risen too fast and as the country’s currency
rebounded after approaching 100 yen to the  U.S. dollar .  Mitsubishi Estate Co.,  Japan ’s biggest developer by market
value, led  real-estate stocks  lower after the sector rose to its
highest level in 5 1/2 years yesterday. Credit Saison Co. fell
7.7 percent, the most since the aftermath of the 2011
earthquake, after a gauge of consumer lenders jumped by the most
since 2009. Okuma Corp., a machine-tools maker, jumped 8.9
percent after Credit Suisse AG raised its investment rating on
the company.  The  Topix Index (TPX)  closed little changed at 1,102.04, with
about three shares falling for every two that rose. The measure
advanced 11 percent since April 2, the day before the  Bank of
Japan  began a policy meeting which resulted in increased
stimulus to boost the economy. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average
closed little changed at 13,192.35, with volume 24 percent
higher than its 30-day average.  “The yen has weakened beyond expectations and it’s going
to be pretty good for company earnings,” said  Tomomi Yamashita ,
a senior  fund manager  who helps oversee about 500 billion yen
($5 billion) at Shinkin Asset Management Co. in  Tokyo . “It
could be a good time to buy when shares decline. There’s a sense
of being overbought on some shares.”  The yen weakened to as low as 99.66 per dollar today before
trading at 99.14 at the close of Tokyo stock trading. Weakness
in the yen, which hasn’t been at 100 per dollar since April
2009, is the result of policies to end deflation, Japanese
Finance Minister Taro Aso said today.  Easing Measures  The Japanese currency has fallen about 2.8 percent against
the dollar since Bank of Japan officials said on April 4 they
will increase monthly bond purchases to 7.5 trillion yen ($75
billion). That exceeded the 5.2 trillion yen forecast by
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. They also suspended a cap on
some holdings and dropped a limit on debt maturities, while also
setting a two-year horizon for their goal of 2 percent
inflation.  The Topix has jumped 53 percent from mid-November as Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe and central bank Governor Haruhiko Kuroda
pledged to defeat 15 years of deflation. The gauge is trading at
1.3  times book value , compared with 2.3 for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 1.6 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Return Reversal  Real-estate stocks, which are the biggest gainers since the
day before the BOJ policy meeting began, led declines among the
Topix Index’s 33  industry groups  today, followed by consumer
lenders after they surged 20 percent in the past five days.  Mitsubishi Estate slumped 5.3 percent to 3,025 yen, falling
from highest level yesterday since November 2007. Mitsui Fudosan
Co., Japan’s largest property developer by sales, slid 4.1
percent to 3,365 yen.  Consumer lender Credit Saison slumped 7.7 percent to 2,684
yen, the  most  on the  Nikkei 225 (NKY) , after surging 11 percent
yesterday. Orix Corp., a Japanese financial-services provider,
lost 5.4 percent to 1,410 yen after closing at its highest level
since September 2008 yesterday.  “Stocks that had risen too quickly, such as real estate,
are ricocheting but it’s a healthy adjustment,” said Hidehiro Tomioka, who overseas about $1.3 billion as head of equity
investment at Manulife Asset Management Japan Ltd. “The 2
percent inflation target set by the BOJ will be hard to reach
with the stimulus measures they have now, so we can expect some
additional stimulus in the future. Stocks may rise another 30
percent within the year.”  Gainers  Among stocks that rose, Okuma jumped 8.9 percent 760 yen,
posting the biggest advance on the Nikkei 225. Fanuc Corp., the
world’s largest maker of controls that run  machine tools , gained
2.8 percent to 15,160 yen. Fanuc’s share price momentum will
pick up in tandem with a recovery in machine tool orders, Credit
Suisse wrote in a note yesterday, while also raising its
 investment rating  on Okuma to neutral from underperform.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index fell 0.5 percent
to 29.64 today, indicating traders expect a swing of about 8.5
percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
