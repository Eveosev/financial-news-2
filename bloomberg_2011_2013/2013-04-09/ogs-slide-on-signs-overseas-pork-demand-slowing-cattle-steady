Hog futures dropped for the third
time in four sessions on signs that overseas demand for U.S.
pork is ebbing. Cattle were little changed.  U.S. exporters shipped 820.78 million pounds (372,297
metric tons) of pork in the two months through Feb. 28, down 14
percent from a year earlier, government  data  showed yesterday.
 Russia , the sixth-biggest buyer of U.S. pork last year, has
banned the imports, saying the products may contain ractopamine,
a feed additive used to add lean muscle in livestock.  “There’s just a little cloud looming over our heads with
exports,” Jason Golly, a vice president of risk-management
marketing at Lynch Livestock Inc. in Waucoma,  Iowa , said in a
telephone interview.  Hog futures for June settlement fell 0.5 percent to 90.125
cents a pound at 9:25 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Prices were down 3.3 percent in the 12 months through yesterday.  China , the world’s biggest pork consumer, started
stockpiling frozen pork for state reserves in more than 20
provinces to prevent prices from falling further, according to
the National Development and Reform Commission. Oversupply in
the Chinese pork market will continue amid high production
capacity, the commission said in a statement posted on its
website April 7.  Cattle futures for June delivery slid 0.1 percent to
$1.2195 a pound on the CME. Prices were down 7.8 percent in 2013
through yesterday.  Feeder-cattle futures for May settlement rose 0.1 percent
to $1.44925 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
