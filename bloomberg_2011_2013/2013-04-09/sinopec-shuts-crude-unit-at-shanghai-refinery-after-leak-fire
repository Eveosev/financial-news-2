Sinopec  Shanghai  Petrochemical Co.
had a fire at its refinery that shut a residue hydrocracker,
according to the company’s board secretary.  The blaze started this afternoon and was caused by a leak
at the unit, which has a capacity of 3.9 million metric tons,
Zhang Jingming said by phone today. Sinopec Shanghai
extinguished the fire “very quickly” without casualties and
other units were undamaged, he said. The company is working to
resume production “shortly” and supplies of refined products
won’t be affected, according to Zhang.  Sinopec Shanghai  rose 2 percent  to HK$3.09 in Hong Kong
trading today after the company said yesterday that it had a net
income of about 170 million  yuan  ($27.4 million) in the first
quarter, compared with a loss in the same period a year earlier.
The benchmark Hang Seng Index climbed 0.7 percent.  The refinery plans to process 15 million tons of crude this
year, Zhang said today. A residue hydrocracker breaks down fuel
oil into higher-value products such as gasoline and diesel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
