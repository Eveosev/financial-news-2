A 60-year old man in rural  Serbia 
killed 13 people in a shooting spree before dawn, the head of
the national police force said today on state broadcaster  RTS .  The man identified as Ljubisa Bogdanovic first shot his own
son in the head in their home in the village of Velika Ivanca,
south of Belgrade. He then wounded his wife before killing 12
neighbors in four nearby homes, Milorad Veljovic said in the TV
interview.  The gunman then reportedly shot himself nine times in the
head and remains hospitalized in critical condition, according
to Zaklina Simic, a doctor from Belgradeâ€™s emergency medical
service, on RTS.  Veljovic declined to give further details, including
possible motive for the attack, and said an investigation is
ongoing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
