Chilean copper miners at Codelco,
the worldâ€™s largest producer, walked off the job and set the
stage for what may be the first-ever nationwide strike by copper
miners as workers push for greater job security.  The Codelco strike will last for 24 hours, union leader
Miguel Lopez said by phone today from the Chuquicamata mine.
Workers are also set to put down tools at  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  and
 BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  mines, union worker Raimundo Espinoza said
yesterday.  Copper for delivery in three months rose 1 percent to
$7,522.25 a metric ton by 11:38 a.m. on the London Metal
Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
