The U.S. urged Ukrainian President
Viktor Yanukovych to free former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko
from prison after he pardoned one of her allies.  Releasing former Interior Minister Yuriy Lutsenko is “an
important step” toward addressing concerns over democracy and
the rule of law, Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the National
Security Council, said today in an e-mailed statement.  “Much more remains to be done,” she said. “We urge
Ukrainian authorities to end all politically motivated
prosecutions, undertake comprehensive judicial reform to ensure
such selective justice does not recur, and fully implement the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in  Europe 
recommendations made after the 2012 parliamentary elections.”  Yanukovych pardoned Lutsenko April 7 after the European
Union sought his release as a condition for progressing with an
association agreement and free-trade pact. The accord was
delayed indefinitely after Tymoshenko was jailed in 2011, a move
the 27-member bloc deems an example of selective justice.  To contact the reporter on this story:
