Peru’s sol dropped from a seven-week
high after the central bank doubled the pace of dollar purchases
to slow gains in the local currency.  The sol depreciated 0.1 percent to 2.5780 per  U.S. dollar 
at today’s close, according to prices from Datatec. The currency
rallied yesterday to 2.5750, its strongest since Feb. 15.  Banco Central de Reserva del Peru said on its website that
it bought $160 million today after purchasing $80 million
yesterday to stem gains as companies exchanged dollars to pay
income taxes in local currency.  The intervention isn’t likely to create shortages as
“dollar liquidity is more comfortable this month,” said
Gonzalo Navarro, the head trader at the local unit of Banco
Santander SA.  The central bank sold 100 million soles in six-month and
one-year certificates of deposit, according to its website.
After buying dollars, the monetary authority issues the
securities to absorb the extra soles from the market through a
process known as sterilization.  The yield on  Peru ’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol bond due in
August 2020 was little changed at 3.75 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The price was little changed at
125.85 centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
