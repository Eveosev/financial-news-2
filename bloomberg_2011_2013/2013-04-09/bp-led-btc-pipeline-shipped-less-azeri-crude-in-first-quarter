The BP Plc-led Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan
pipeline shipped less oil from  Azerbaijan  in the first quarter
as the country’s crude production declined.  The so-called BTC link carried 7.34 million metric tons of
oil, down 7.4 percent from a year earlier, according to data
published today on the  website  of  State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan ,
or Socar, a partner in the project.  Oil output in the Caspian Sea nation, the largest crude
producer in the former  Soviet Union  after Russia and Kazakhstan,
dropped 3.6 percent in the first two months of 2013 from a year
earlier, the State Statistics Committee said March 15.
Production also fell in 2012, marking a second year of decline.  The 1,768-kilometer (1,100-mile) BTC link connecting
Azerbaijan’s Caspian Sea coast with  Turkey ’s Mediterranean port
of Ceyhan, via Georgia, also exported 317,981 tons of Turkmen
oil in the first quarter, up 13 percent from a year earlier,
according to Socar data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
