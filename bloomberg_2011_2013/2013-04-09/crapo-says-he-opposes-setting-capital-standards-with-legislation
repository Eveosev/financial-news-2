Senate Banking Committee ranking
member Michael Crapo, a Republican from Idaho, said setting
capital standards for large banks should be a decision for
regulators, not lawmakers.  “On the capital issue, clearly we need to have the correct
and safe capital levels established,” Crapo said in an
interview. “I think that’s a function that the regulators who
have the expertise should achieve, should focus on. It certainly
is not a political decision.”  Crapo’s comments put him at odds with the concept behind a
bill by Senators Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, and David Vitter, a Republican from Louisiana, that would set capital
standards for the largest banks, in part to prevent banks from
being perceived as too big to fail. Vitter and Brown say that
the capital standards proposed by regulators are too low.  Crapo said he prefers to attack the too-big-to-fail
perception with “an enhanced bankruptcy procedure rather than
to pursue a government break up.” He said he has not read the
Brown-Vitter bill.  A draft of the measure would require U.S. regulators to
scrap international Basel III requirements and instead impose a
higher capital standard: 10 percent for all banks and an
additional surcharge of 5 percent for institutions with more
than $400 billion in assets. The Senators plan to introduce
their bill later this month.  “Most people would agree that we have too much
concentration in the banking world at the top with regard to the
big banks,” Crapo said. “The question is how do we approach
resolving that issue.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
