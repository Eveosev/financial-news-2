UkrAgroConsult cut its forecast for
Ukraineâ€™s wheat harvest by 6.6 percent to 20.23 million metric
tons, said Olena Loshkaryova, an analyst with the Kiev-based
agriculture researcher.  That compared with the 21.65 million tons forecast a month
ago, Loshkaryova said by phone today. The wheat yield estimate
was reduced to 3.08 tons per hectare (2.47 acres) from 3.21
tons, according to the analyst.  UkrAgroConsult reduced its total grain-harvest forecast on
April 4 to 52.4 million tons from 53 million tons because of
late sowing of spring crops.  To contact the reporter on this story:
