Light Louisiana Sweet on the  spot
market  strengthened the day after it reached a nine-month low as
Brent’s premium to the U.S. benchmark grew.  Brent widened its differential to West Texas Intermediate
by 66 cents to $11.96 a barrel at 2:32 p.m. in New York. The
spread settled at $11.30 yesterday, the smallest since July 22.
It’s shrunk from $20.79 on March 5 as supplies have increased in
the  North Sea  and West Africa while refiner demand has declined
due to maintenance in Europe and  Asia .  Brent is expected to strengthen over the next few months as
refineries return from maintenance and domestic demand in the
Middle East increases, limiting supply, Jan Stuart, head of
energy research at Credit Suisse Group AG in  New York , said in a
note to clients yesterday.  LLS and other Gulf of Mexico crudes compete with foreign
oils priced against Brent for space in U.S. Gulf Coast
refineries.  LLS strengthened by 55 cents to a premium of $14.05 a
barrel more than WTI in Cushing,  Oklahoma , at 1:59 p.m. New York
time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yesterday the
premium fell to $13.50, the weakest level since June 5. Heavy
Louisiana Sweet strengthened by 25 cents to $14.80 a barrel more
than WTI.  Mars Blend, a medium-sour crude from the Gulf, strengthened
by 20 cents to $8.50 a barrel more than WTI. Its premium
yesterday was the smallest since Jan. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
