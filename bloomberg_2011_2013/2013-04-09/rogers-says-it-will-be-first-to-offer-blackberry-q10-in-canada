Rogers Communications Inc. (RCI/B)  and Telus Corp., two of  Canada ’s largest wireless carriers, began taking  pre-orders  for BlackBerry’s Q10 smartphone, a model that sports the company’s classic keyboard.  The phone will be available for C$199.99 ($197) when customers sign up for a three-year contract, Toronto-based Rogers said today in a statement. The carrier didn’t give a release date, beyond saying it would arrive in the “coming weeks.” Telus, based in  Vancouver , also didn’t say when the phone would be available.  The Q10 is the second phone in BlackBerry’s revamped lineup, following a touch-screen device called the Z10. BlackBerry is counting on the newer model to appeal to longtime users who want to stick with a physical keypad, rather than relying on an iPhone-like screen.  BlackBerry said last week that customers could start pre-ordering the Q10 in the U.K., the first country to offer the device. The company followed a similar rollout strategy with the Z10, which didn’t appear in the U.S. until almost two months after it was released in the U.K.  Future Shop and Best Buy Co. also announced that they are taking pre-orders for the Q10 in Canada. Details on the phone’s availability in other markets will follow shortly, Waterloo, Ontario-based BlackBerry said today.  Rogers’s stock was little changed in Toronto trading today, closing at C$51.71. Shares of BlackBerry climbed 1.2 percent to $14.85 in  New York .
