The  New York  Jets signed former
Jacksonville Jaguars and Baltimore Ravens safety Dawan Landry,
the older brother of LaRon Landry, the team said in a statement.  Dawan Landry, 30, was released by the Jaguars last month,
after playing for them for two years. He was with the Ravens for
five years before that, three of them when current Jets head
coach Rex Ryan was the defensive coordinator there.  LaRon Landry, 28, also a safety, joined the Jets before
last season and was selected to the National Football League’s
Pro Bowl after five years with the Washington Redskins.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
