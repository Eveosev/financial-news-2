Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , the largest
 oil company  in Latin America by market value, said Argentina
needs clear rules to foster investments if it wants to develop
its unconventional oil and gas resources.  A clear investment environment is needed to lower “the
risks” of investing in production of tight and shale gas and
oil in Argentina, Paulo Aquino, the Rio de Janeiro-based oil
producer’s executive manager for Latin America, said in a
presentation at the Arpel conference in Punta del Este, Uruguay.
Petrobras, as the company is known, is looking to increase
production of so-called unconventional resources in Argentina,
he said.  Argentina last year nationalized  YPF SA (YPFD) , the country’s
largest oil company, by seizing 51 percent of its shares from
Repsol SA in an attempt to reverse years of declining output.
YPF holds the bulk of Argentina’s shale resources. The Vaca
Muerta formation in southern Argentina is estimated to hold at
least 23 billion barrels of oil equivalent, according to a
survey by Ryder Scott.  Petrobras Argentina SA, as the Brazilian state-controlled
oil producer’s local unit is called, finished drilling its first
shale oil well in March at Vaca Muerta. While the company is
analyzing results from the well, it’s already producing tight
gas after having drilled 29 tight gas wells in three basins,
Aquino said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
