The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development has almost doubled its financing to modernize
wastewater treatment facilities serving a city of about 630,000
people in southern  Kazakhstan .  A new 10.3 million-euro ($13.4 million) loan will add to
earlier financing of 13.6 million euros to Vodnye Resursy
Marketing, a private water utility in Shymkent, to extend
wastewater services to as many as 3,500 customers not connected
to sewage networks and to help build a biogas plant due to be
completed late this year, the EBRD said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
