The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has turned to Grammy-winning musician Amy Grant to highlight products that can guard consumers against unexpected events.  “Planning ahead and getting smart about insurance can give you peace of mind,” Grant, who has also won more than 20  Dove Awards  from the Gospel Music Association, said in a video recorded for the U.S. group. “That’s why I support the NAIC.”  The NAIC, which includes a mix of elected and appointed state insurance watchdogs, is seeking to increase its visibility as members contend with expanded federal involvement in health insurance and European efforts to regulate capital. Ex- Democratic Senator Ben Nelson was named as the group’s chief executive officer in January.  “We needed the gravitas, the phone calls returned, to go to Capitol Hill, to tell our story, defend our turf,” Jim Donelon, NAIC president and Louisiana insurance commissioner, said at the time of the appointment.  The NAIC said Grant’s remarks were filmed in  Tennessee  where she lives. In her final days battling dementia, Grant’s mother lived in the musician’s home. Today Grant, 52, and her sisters are caring for their father, who suffers from the same disease, according to the statement.  “At first I found myself asking, ‘Why is this happening to my family?’” Grant said in an NAIC  statement  today. “But somewhere along the way I realized these were the last great lessons from my parents: Protect the people and things you love. Enjoy every second life gives you. And, plan ahead so when unexpected turns come, you’re ready.”  To contact the reporter on this story: Zachary Tracer in  New York  at  ztracer1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Dan Kraut at  dkraut2@bloomberg.net
