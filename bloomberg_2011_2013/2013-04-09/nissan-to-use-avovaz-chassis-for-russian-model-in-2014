(Corrects to clarify holding agreement in fifth paragraph
of April 9 story.)  Nissan Motor (7201)  Co. plans to start
making low-cost Datsun models in Russia next year using a
chassis by  OAO AvtoVAZ (AVAZ) , the second foreign auto maker to
integrate a Russian base into an international brand after the
Chevrolet Niva began production in 2000.  Production is slated to begin in 2014, AvtoVAZ Chief
Financial Officer Oleg Lobanov said today at the annual
Automotive Forum in Moscow. Russia’s biggest carmaker also
expects to make about 1 million cars per year by 2020 using four
platforms including the B0 by Renault, Lobanov said. AvtoVAZ
started Nissan Almera production based on the B0 in December and
is preparing to assemble a Renault model on the same platform,
he said.  “Unification of the product lines will allow construction
of an effective production system,” Lobanov said. “Picking the
Kalina base for the international brand is proof of AvtoVAZ’s
quality of development.”  Nissan announced the revival of the Datsun brand in March
2012 after it was shelved more than 30 years ago. The company
plans to start sales of newly developed Datsun cars in 2014 in
 South Africa , India,  Indonesia  and Russia, Nissan said in a
statement in February.  A Renault-Nissan alliance signed an agreement with Russian
Technologies, the main AvtoVAZ shareholder, to boost control of
the carmaker in December. The alliance will get 67.13 percent of
the joint venture, which will get 74.5 percent of AvtoVAZ.  Nissan Sales  Nissan sales fell 15 percent to 35,916 cars in the first
three months of 2013 from a year earlier, while AvtoVAZ sales
slumped 2 percent to 107,427 cars, according to the Association
of European Business.  General Motors Co. (GM)  used a car base developed by AvtoVAZ in
2000 to produce the Chevrolet Niva off-road vehicle. Niva is one
of the top 10 cars in Russia by sales, according to AEB.  To contact the reporter on this story:
