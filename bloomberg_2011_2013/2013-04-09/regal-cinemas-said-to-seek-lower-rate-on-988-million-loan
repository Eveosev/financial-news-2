Regal Cinemas Inc. (RGC) , a movie-theater
operator, is seeking to reduce the rate on a $988 million first-
lien loan, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  Credit Suisse Group AG is leading the financing for the
unit of Regal Entertainment Group and will host a lender call at
3:30 p.m. today in New York, said the person, who asked not to
be identified because the deal is private.  The debt, which expires in August 2017, will pay interest
at 3 percentage points more than the London interbank offered
rate or 2.75 percentage points more than the lending benchmark,
depending upon leverage, or debt to earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization, the person said.  Regal obtained the existing loan in 2011 at a rate of 3.25
percentage points more than Libor, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The debt fell 0.625 cent to 100.625 cents on the dollar
from 101.25 cents yesterday, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg.  Ken Thewes, a spokesman for Regal, didn’t immediately
return a phone call seeking comment.  The proposed transaction will be offered to lenders at par,
the person said. Libor, the rate banks charge to lend to each
other, won’t have a minimum.  Lenders to the new loan will receive call protection for
one year at 101 cents, the person said, meaning Knoxville,
Tennessee-based Regal would have to pay one cent more than face
value to reprice the debt in its first year.  The new financing will strip out financial-maintenance
covenants under Regal’s credit pact, the person said.  First-lien debt is repaid first in a bankruptcy or
liquidation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
