Saudi Arabia’s stock market will
attract investors such as  Carlyle Group LP (CG) , the world’s second-
biggest private-equity firm, when it opens to foreign investors,
said Firas Nasir, co-head of the company’s MENA fund.  “The Saudi market opening would attract investors like us
more to Saudi as it would be easier to exit,” Nasir said today
at the Bloomberg Doha conference. The Washington-based firm has
made two of its about six investments in its $500 million Middle
East and North Africa fund in Saudi Arabia, he said.  Banks, including Deutsche Bank AG and HSBC Holdings Plc,
are predicting that Saudi Arabia’s $390 billion stock market may
open to foreigners as early as next year amid rising demand for
assets in the largest Arab economy. The kingdom may attract as
much as $30 billion of inflows, John Burbank, founder of $3.7
billion San Francisco-based hedge fund Passport Capital LLC,
said in February.  Saudi Arabia, which said last year it will open the stock
market gradually, only allows non-resident foreigners outside of
the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council to invest through equity
swaps and exchange-traded funds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
