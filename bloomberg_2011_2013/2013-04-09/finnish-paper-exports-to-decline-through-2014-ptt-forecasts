Paper exports from Finland will
contract for a third year in 2013 as low demand prompts capacity
cuts, PTT Research Institute said.  Paper sales abroad will decline as much as an annual 3
percent this year and as much as 4 percent in 2014, the
Helsinki-based organization said in an e-mailed statement.
Reduced output means paper prices will increase 2 percent at
most in 2013 and 2 percent to 3 percent in 2014, PTT said.  Finland’s stalwarts  Stora Enso Oyj (STERV)  and  UPM-Kymmene Oyj (UPM1V)  are
battling a slump in the European paper industry. Europe’s two
biggest papermakers have shuttered production lines and cut jobs
in response to falling demand for paper, in part as consumers
shift to online media.  UPM Chief Executive Officer Jussi Pesonen said he sees a
negative impact from prices, volumes and exchange rates on the
European paper business, according to an April 4 statement. The
structural changes will benefit the industry, Pesonen said. UPM
yesterday said it will shutter paper machine 3 at the Rauma mill
in Finland and paper machine 4 at Ettringen in Germany, cutting
237 jobs.  Pulp exports will increase as much as 5 percent this year
and the next, and paperboard sales abroad will increase this
year by as much as 3 percent, PTT said. The Finnish sawmill
industry could grow as much as 5 percent in 2013 and is set to
benefit from the euro’s estimated weakening against the Swedish
krona, according to PTT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
