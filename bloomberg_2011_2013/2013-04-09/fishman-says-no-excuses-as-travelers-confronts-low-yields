Travelers Cos. (TRV)  said it must focus on
raising insurance rates and responding to client claims with its
own staff, rather than lamenting how low bond yields and the
increased frequency of natural disasters pressure returns.  “We are a no-excuses company in a no-excuses industry,”
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jay Fishman, 60, said in a
 letter  to shareholders posted today on the New York-based
insurer’s website.  Travelers gained 21 percent last year, beating the 19
percent advance of the eight-company Standard and Poor’s 500
Property & Casualty Insurance  Index (S5PROP)  as Fishman charged some
clients more for coverage. That helped the CEO as bond yields
fell, pressuring income from investments that back obligations
to policyholders. Superstorm Sandy fueled record claims, a year
after U.S. tornadoes caused more losses than  Hurricane Katrina .  “We started to take action in response to the weather
patterns and low interest rates in the middle of 2010,” Fishman
wrote. “We embarked on a deliberate, carefully calibrated
strategy of selectively but actively raising rates.”  Fishman said that Travelers, the lone property-casualty
insurer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, relies on its own
staff, rather than outsourcing claims adjustment for natural
disasters. That approach led to better  customer service  after
Sandy battered the U.S. Northeast in the fourth quarter, he said
in the letter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
