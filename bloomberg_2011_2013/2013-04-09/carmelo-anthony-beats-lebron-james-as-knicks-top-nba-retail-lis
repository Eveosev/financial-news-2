Carmelo Anthony of the  New York
Knicks  has the best-selling jersey in National Basketball
Association retail outlets, while his team’s branded merchandise
remains the most popular choice among fans.  Anthony’s No. 7 shirt has outsold the No. 6 jersey of the
Miami Heat’s  LeBron James  since November at the NBA’s store on
Fifth Avenue in New York and its online outlet, the league said
in an e-mailed statement. It didn’t list sales figures.  It’s the first time a Knicks player has led the ranking
since it was first released in the 2001-02 season, the NBA said.
James, a three-time NBA Most Valuable Player, has led four
times.  Kevin Durant  of the Oklahoma City Thunder is third on the
list, followed by Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers and
 Derrick Rose  of the Chicago Bulls.  Anthony, a six-time All-Star, leads the league with a 28.4-
points-per-game scoring average this season. He moved ahead of
Durant two days ago by scoring 36 points in a 125-120 road win
over the Thunder.  The Heat are the second-most popular team in merchandise
sales, followed by the Lakers, Brooklyn Nets and Bulls, the
league said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
