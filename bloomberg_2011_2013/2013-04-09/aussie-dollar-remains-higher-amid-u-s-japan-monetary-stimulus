The Australian and New Zealand
dollars strengthened as monetary stimulus in the U.S. and  Japan 
weighed on those countries’ bond yields, boosting the relative
value of the South Pacific nations’ assets.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday
that expansionary monetary policies in the world’s largest
economies are “mutually constructive.” The so-called Aussie
reached a 4 1/2-year high against the yen after the  Bank of
Japan (8301)  boosted bond purchases last week in a program known as
quantitative easing, or QE. New Zealand’s dollar gained to the
highest in six weeks versus its Australian peer after data
showed the smaller nation’s house prices rose.  “It’s QE everywhere,” said Hans Kunnen, the chief
economist in Sydney at St. George Bank Ltd. “We’re not engaging
in that practice. So the Aussie dollar should strengthen against
the euro,  U.S. dollar  and yen simply on the basis of the
interest-rate structure and a relative lack of supply.”  The Australian dollar advanced 0.2 percent to $1.0429 as of
4:21 p.m. in Sydney. It touched 103.82 yen, the highest since
July 2008, before trading little changed at 103.42.  New
Zealand ’s currency, nicknamed the kiwi, added 0.3 percent to
84.89 U.S. cents and rose 0.1 percent to 84.15 yen.  The kiwi advanced 0.2 percent to NZ$1.2285 per Australian
dollar after reaching NZ$1.2274, the strongest since Feb. 25.  Australian Bonds  The yield on  Australia ’s current  10-year note  rose two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.24 percent. It fell
to 3.18 percent yesterday, a level unseen since Dec. 12. New
Zealand’s two-year interest-rate swap advanced two basis points
to 2.90 percent.  Bernanke said monetary stimulus from global central banks
“is providing additional support for other countries through
stronger financial markets, more exports.” He commented in
response to audience questions at a conference in Stone
Mountain,  Georgia .  Home prices  rose 6.5 percent in March from a year earlier,
Quotable Value New Zealand, a government-owned property research
company, said in an e-mailed statement. That’s the biggest
increase since 2008.  A gauge of Australia’s business conditions fell to minus 7
in March from minus 3 the prior month, a report from National
Australia Bank Ltd. showed today. An index of business
confidence rose to 2 from 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
