Chinese equities  in New York
rallied the most in almost three weeks, led by commodity
producers and solar makers, as easing inflation damped concern
Asia’s second-largest economy will tighten monetary policy.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S. jumped 1.3 percent to 90.58
yesterday, the steepest advance since March 20.  Suntech Power
Holdings Co. (STP)  climbed as much as 48 percent, while LDK Solar Co.
surged 23 percent.  Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. (YZC) , Aluminum Corp. of
China Ltd. and  China Life Insurance Co. (LFC)  rose the most since
January.  Vipshop Holdings Ltd. (VIPS)  fell 3.3 percent.  Government data released yesterday showed Chinese consumer
prices eased from a 10-month high in March, rising 2.1 percent
after economists predicted 2.5 percent growth.  Producer prices 
for raw materials also fell for the 13th straight month. The
world’s second-largest economy is seeking to preserve growth
after emerging from a seven-quarter slowdown while also checking
inflation. The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  of domestic stocks rose
the most since March 20.  “Right now it’s hard to imagine the government will take
tightening measures as the CPI looks stable,” Clement Miller,
an investment strategist at Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors
Inc., which managed about $20.5 billion in assets at the end of
2012, said by phone from Baltimore. “With the long-term company
profit growth outlook strong, and with the Chinese stock market
very attractively valued, China is a country where you
definitely want to be invested.”  ETF Surges  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., jumped 1.7 percent to $36.24
in New York, the steepest one-day rally since March 20. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.4 percent to 1,568.61.  China’s exports in March increased 11.7 percent from a year
earlier, according to the median estimate of 36 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey, before the customs administration reports
the figures today. Overseas shipments  grew  21.8 percent in
February.  Companies on the China-US gauge are trading 13.5 times
estimated  forward earnings , 4.5 percent below the S&P 500’s
valuation, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The discount
widened to 5.4 percent on April 8, the biggest since December
2008.  The 2.1 percent growth in March  consumer prices  compared
with a 3.2 percent gain in February, and producer prices fell
1.9 percent last month, extending a slump that started from
March of 2012, according to figures from the National Bureau of
Statistics in Beijing.  “If you look at CPI as a kind of proxy for prices
companies sell at, and producer price index as a proxy for the
cost for inputs, it shows a better profitability outlook for
companies,” Wilmington Trust’s Miller said.  Premium Income  Yanzhou Coal, the nation’s fourth-largest miner of the
fuel, advanced 4.7 percent to $12.59, rallying the most since
Jan. 2.  Aluminum Corp. (ACH) , China’s largest maker of the light
metal, known as Chalco, also surged 4.7 percent to $9.63 in New
York, the steepest gain since Jan. 10. Its ADRs, each
representing 25 underlying shares, traded 3.1 percent above the
Hong Kong stock, the highest  premium  this year.  ADRs of China Life, the nation’s biggest insurer, surged
3.8 percent to $39.10, rising the most in three months.  The Beijing-based insurer’s first-quarter premium income
declined 2 percent from a year earlier, which was better than
what investors had expected, the Shanghai Securities News
 reported  yesterday, citing results it received from an
unidentified source. On a monthly basis, the insurer’s premium
in March improved from the previous month, and April income is
expected to gain from a year earlier, according to the report.  Listing Criteria  Suntech, the world’s biggest solar-panel maker in 2011,
jumped 29 percent to 62 cents in New York, the biggest advance
since November 2011. The shares have gained 49 percent over the
past two days.  The Wuxi-based company, which defaulted on a $541 million
bond repayment last month, had slumped 29 percent as of last
week since Chinese banks filed an insolvency petition for its
main unit March 20. A news service owned by Hong Kong Economic
Times said April 8  Warren Buffett ’s MidAmerican Energy Holdings
Co. may buy the solar panel maker, citing an unidentified
person.  Suntech “doesn’t comment on speculation,” Shashin Surti,
the company’s external communications manager at Weber
Shandwick, said by e-mail yesterday.  Solars Jump  The solar maker received a notice from the New York Stock
Exchange that it failed to meet the criteria for continued
listing as the  price  of its ADR was below $1 for 30 consecutive
days through April 4, it said in a statement yesterday. It’s the
second time for Suntech to get such a warning, after ADR prices
dropped below $1 for the first time in August. Suntech intends
to “cure this deficiency” within a six-month time frame in
accordance with NYSE rules, it said.  LDK, based in Xinyu of Jiangxi province, surged to $1.32,
the largest rally since March 26.  Yingli Green Energy Holding
Co. (YGE) , the world’s biggest solar panel maker by shipments, climbed
21 percent to $2.24 on a fourth day of gains.  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL) 
added 15 percent to $4.4.  Online fashion retailer Vipshop dropped to $29.99 in the
biggest one-day slump since March 18.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  in Hong Kong jumped
1.7 percent to 10,610.77 yesterday, the biggest advance in three
weeks. The Shanghai Composite climbed 0.6 percent to 2,225.78
after a four-day slump, rebounding from the lowest level in
2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
