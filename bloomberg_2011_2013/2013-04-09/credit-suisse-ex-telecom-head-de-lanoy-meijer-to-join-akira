David de Lanoy Meijer, the former
head of  Credit Suisse (CSGN)  Group AG’s telecommunications investment
banking practice in Europe, the  Middle East  and Africa, is
joining Akira Partners LLP.  De Lanoy Meijer, who left Credit Suisse at the end of last
year, will start this week, London-based mergers and
acquisitions advisory firm Akira said.  De Lanoy Meijer has lead the Credit Suisse division since
2009 and most recently worked on the initial public offerings
for Russian telecom company MegaFon OAO and Kazakhstan’s  KCell
JSC (KCEL) , Akira said. The Oxford graduate also managed the 6.6
billion-euro ($8.6 billion) refinancing of Wind
Telecomunicazioni SpA and the $5.5 billion merger of  VimpelCom
Ltd (VIP)  and VimpelCom OJSC in 2010, Akira said.  “It’s part of the evolution of what we’re trying to do,
which is to be a real force in the TMT sector,” Andre Sokol,
Akira founding partner, said today. Sokol, the former head of
mergers and acquisitions for  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , said he was
particularly interested in de Lanoy Meijer’s work in  emerging
markets .  Last year, Akira hired Panos Metsis, the former executive
director at JP Morgan Chase & Co.’s telecommunications, cable
and pay-television investment banking division in Europe, the
Middle East and Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
