West Texas Intermediate fell,
halting a two-day advance as a report showed stockpiles of U.S.
crude increased to the highest level since 1981.  Futures slipped as much as 0.6 percent in New York after
the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute said
inventories gained 5.1 million barrels last week. An Energy
Department report today may show supplies advanced 1.5 million
barrels to about 391 million, the highest in 22 years, according
to a Bloomberg survey of analysts. OPEC trimmed its estimate for
global oil demand growth.  “The second quarter is the weakest from the perspective of
oil global demand,” said  Hannes Loacker , an analyst at
Raiffeisen Bank International AG in Vienna. Brent crude may drop
further, he said. The blend slumped 5.4 percent last week.  WTI for May delivery slid as much as 52 cents to $93.68 a
barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange
and was at $93.84 at 12:46 p.m. London time. The volume of all
futures traded was 24 percent less than the 100-day average. The
contract increased 84 cents to $94.20 yesterday, its biggest
gain since March 26 and the highest close since April 3.  Brent for May settlement lost 30 cents to $105.93 a barrel
on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange today. The
European benchmark had a premium of $12.09 to WTI, up from
$12.03 at yesterday’s close. The premium settled at $11.30 on
April 8, the narrowest since June 22.  Gasoline Supplies  U.S. gasoline supplies increased by 1.96 million barrels
last week, the API said. They are forecast to fall  1.5 million
barrels  in the government report due at 10:30 a.m. in
 Washington , according to the median estimate of 11 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. Distillate inventories, a category that
includes heating oil and diesel, slid 1.3 million barrels in the
API report, compared with a projected 1.5 million-barrel decline
in the Energy Department’s report.  “Demand in the U.S. is still very weak and we can’t see
any change to that,” said David Lennox, an analyst at Fat
Prophets in Sydney. “That’s on the back of continued low
economic activity and high unemployment. There is probably no
reason why the Energy Department figures will be any different”
to the API data, he said.  Prices and Demand  The API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Information Administration, the Energy Department’s statistics
unit, for its weekly survey.  The EIA increased its  WTI price forecast  for 2013 late
yesterday, predicting new pipeline and rail capacity will narrow
the grade’s discount to Brent. New York crude will average
$93.92 a barrel this year, up 2.2 percent from a March
projection of $91.92, the EIA said in its Short-Term Energy
Outlook yesterday.  Worldwide oil consumption will rise this year by 800,000
barrels a day, or 0.9 percent, revised down from 840,000 last
month, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said in
its monthly oil market report today. “Demand in the second half
of this year is seen to be much higher than the first,” OPEC
said. “The bulk of the growth is expected to come from China.”  China , the world’s second-biggest oil consumer, bought
22.78 million metric tons of crude more than it exported last
month, according to figures released on the website of the
Beijing-based General Administration of Customs today. That’s
equivalent to net imports of 5.39 million barrels a day, the
fewest since September, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
