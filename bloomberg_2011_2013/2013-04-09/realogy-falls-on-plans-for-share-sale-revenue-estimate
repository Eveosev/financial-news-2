Realogy Holdings Corp. (RLGY) , the real
estate brokerage company backed by  Apollo Global Management LLC (APO) ,
fell more than 8 percent after saying it plans a secondary stock
offering and estimating sales below analysts’ forecasts.  Realogy plans to offer 35 million shares held by Apollo,
the Parsippany, New Jersey-based company said in a statement
today after the close of regular trading. Apollo, the private-
equity firm started by  Leon Black , will own about 30.4 million
shares after the sale if underwriters don’t exercise an option
to buy additional stock.  Realogy, which owns the Century 21 and Coldwell Banker
brands, expects to report first-quarter revenue of $950 million
to $960 million, the company said in a separate statement. Seven
analysts had an average  estimate  of $997.1 million, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Realogy projected a net loss of $69
million to $78 million.  The shares fell 8.1 percent to $41.43 at 5:59 p.m. New York
time. The stock has gained 65 percent since the company’s
initial public offering on Oct. 10. The biggest one-day loss was
4.1 percent on April 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
