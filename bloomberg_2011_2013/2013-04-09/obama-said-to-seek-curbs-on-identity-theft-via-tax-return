President  Barack Obama ’s 2014 budget
plan will include proposals to combat a rise in identity theft
occurring through tax returns, said an administration official.  Obama’s budget, which will be released tomorrow, will call
for imposing a $5,000 civil penalty for tax-related identity
theft, restricting access to Social Security death records and
allowing employers to avoid putting Social Security numbers on
W-2 wage reporting forms. The official spoke on condition of
anonymity in advance of the budget’s release.  The  Internal Revenue Service  has been trying for several
years to prevent and prosecute tax-refund fraud. Criminals with
access to taxpayers’ identifying information -- sometimes from
death records or employer payroll files -- can create fraudulent
tax returns and obtain refunds before the actual taxpayer is
aware of the theft.  For fiscal year 2012, the IRS’s  identity-theft  unit
received about 450,000 cases, up 78 percent over the previous
year, according to the National Taxpayer Advocate, an
independent organization within the agency.  The proposal was reported earlier by the Associated Press.  To contact the reporter on this story:
