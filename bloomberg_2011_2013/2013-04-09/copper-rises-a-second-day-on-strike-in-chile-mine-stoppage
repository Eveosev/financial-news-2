Copper climbed in  London  as miners
prepared to strike in  Chile , the biggest producer, and the main
crusher at the Collahuasi venture was halted for repairs.
Aluminum, lead, zinc and nickel also climbed.  Copper for delivery in three months climbed as much as 1.1
percent to $7,532 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, and
was at $7,528.25 by 9:25 a.m. in  Shanghai . The metal for August
delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange rose 0.6 percent to
54,920  yuan  ($8,853) a ton. The May-delivery contract on the
Comex in New York gained 0.8 percent to $3.3965 per pound.  Anglo American Plc and Xstrata Plc halted the main crusher
at Collahuasi in Chile to correct processing failures for an
estimated period of 45 days, John MacKenzie, head of copper at
the London-based company, said in an April 5 interview. Chilean
copper miners will hold their first nationwide strike today for
24 hours to push for greater job security.  “The strike news offered support to copper prices,” Wu
Jianjian, an analyst at Yongan Futures Co., said by phone from
Hangzhou. “The rally may face heavy pressure at $7,600 amid
expectations for a surplus.”  The global copper concentrate surplus may reach 350,000
tons this year, said Aurubis AG Chief Executive Officer Peter
Willbrandt.  Consumer prices in  China , the biggest copper user, gained
2.1 percent in March from a year earlier, the National Bureau of
Statistics said today. That compared with a growth of 3.2
percent in February and a median estimate of 2.5 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
