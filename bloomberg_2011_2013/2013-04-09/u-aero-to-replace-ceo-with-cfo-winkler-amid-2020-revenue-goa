  MTU Aero Engines Holding AG (MTX) ,
Germany’s biggest aircraft-engine maker, picked Chief Financial
Officer Reiner Winkler to become chief executive officer next
year, taking on the goal to almost double revenue by 2020.  “After six years as CEO of MTU Aero Engines, I do not want
to extend my contract again,” Egon Behle, the 57-year-old
outgoing CEO, said in a statement today, citing a desire to
“attend to other tasks with regards to my personal life.”
Winkler, 51, will take over on Jan. 1.  MTU has benefited from rising production of  Airbus SAS (EAD) ’s
single-aisle A320 airliners and of  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s 777 model, for
which the German company is a supplier in partnership with
 General Electric Co. (GE)  MTU has a target of 6 billion euros ($7.8
billion) in sales by 2020, compared with annual revenue of 3.38
billion euros last year.  “With his long-standing experience, Reiner Winkler secures
the continuity in the leadership of MTU,” said Klaus Eberhardt,
chairman of the Munich-based company.  Winkler joined MTU in 2001 after positions at companies
including Siemens AG and Daimler-Benz AG. He will retain the CFO
functions, MTU said.  Michael Schreyoegg, who runs MTU’s military programs, will
join the board on July 1, the company said. The 46-year-old will
oversee commercial and military engine development and
production programs.  MTU shares were trading 0.6 percent higher at 73.50 euros
as of 12:38 p.m. in  Frankfurt . The stock has risen 6.8 percent
this year, valuing the company at 3.8 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
