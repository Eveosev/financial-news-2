Confidence among U.S. small
businesses fell in March for the first time in four months as
 job creation  plans soured.  The  National Federation of Independent Business ’s optimism
 index  dropped to 89.5 last month from 90.8 in February. Six of
the measure’s 10 components contributed to the decline, the
Washington-based group said.  The share of business owners planning to create jobs
dropped 4 points to zero in March at the same time sales
expectations deteriorated, the data showed. The figures follow a
Labor Department report last week that showed U.S. employers
boosted payrolls by 88,000 in March, the smallest gain in nine
months.  “Virtually no owners think the current period is a good
time to expand,”  William Dunkelberg , the group’s chief
economist, said in a statement. “There are no plans to create
new jobs in the coming months. It appears there will be little
growth coming from the small business half of the economy.”  The NFIB report was based on a survey of 759 small-business
owners through March 28. Small companies represent more than 99
percent of all U.S employers, according to the U.S. Small
Business Administration. A small business is defined as an
independent enterprise with no more than 500 employees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
