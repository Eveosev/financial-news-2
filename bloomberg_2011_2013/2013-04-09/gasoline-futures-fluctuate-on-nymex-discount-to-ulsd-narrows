Gasoline futures fluctuated,
narrowing the discount to ultra-low-sulfur diesel.  Futures swung between gains and losses. A survey by
Bloomberg projected supplies fell last week. Gasoline’s discount
to ULSD narrowed 1.24 cents to 3.2 cents a gallon. A government
report tomorrow will probably show supplies of the motor fuel
declined for the ninth consecutive week.  “Some of the air in the gasoline market was taken out and,
going forward, we’re going to be keying on the fundamentals,”
said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy
in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “Now the questions are, will we see a
tighter supply picture and are things getting worse on the
economic front so that demand would be impacted.”  Gasoline for May delivery rose 0.13 cent to $2.9106 a
gallon at 9:42 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Trading
volume was 13 percent below the 100-day average.  The May  crack spread  versus WTI gained 20 cents to $29.03 a
barrel. The  spread  against Brent oil on ICE Futures Europe
Exchange slipped 4 cents to $17.49.  The Energy Information Administration will probably report
tomorrow that U.S. gasoline stockpiles declined 1.5 million
barrels in the week ended April 5, according to the median
estimate of 10 analysts in the survey. Distillate supplies also
fell 1.5 million barrels, according to the survey.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, fell 1 cent to
$3.583 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. Prices have
fallen 20.3 cents from the year-to-date high of $3.786 on Feb.
26 and are 34.4 cents below a year earlier.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for May delivery dropped 1.11
cents, or 0.4 percent, to $2.9426 a gallon on volume that was 12
percent above the 100-day average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
