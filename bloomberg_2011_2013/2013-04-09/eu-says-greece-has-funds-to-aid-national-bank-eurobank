Greece  has funds available to
recapitalize  National Bank of Greece SA  and  Eurobank Ergasias SA (EUROB) 
as needed, a European Union official said today.  If the banks aren’t able to raise enough private capital by
the end of this month, as required by Greece’s 130 billion-euro
($170 billion) bailout, the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund
will step in, said the official, who declined to be named
because the talks between the EU and Greece are ongoing. The
fund, financed by rescue money, would then be in position to
decide how to restructure the banks and whether to involve
junior bondholders and shareholders.  The HFSF is fully funded and able to handle any foreseeable
recapitalization needs of the Greek banking system, the official
said in an interview. As a result, Greece won’t be forced to
shut down lenders and impose losses on senior creditors the way
Cyprus was required to as a condition of securing EU aid.  Greece’s central bank has been notified that  National Bank (ETE) 
and Eurobank may not proceed with their planned merger if they
can’t raise enough private capital, a Greek Finance Ministry
official said on April 7. Greece also is in talks with the so-
called troika of the European Commission, the  European Central
Bank  and the  International Monetary Fund  about securing the next
installment of its aid payments.  The capital needs of the two banks are the same whether the
two banks merge or not, and any recapitalization would have an
identical effect on Greece’s debt and deficit, the EU official
said. The EU also will review the matter to make sure Greece’s
actions comply with state aid rules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
