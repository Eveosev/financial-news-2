U.S. industrial stocks are
vulnerable to the kind of weakness they displayed at this time
last year, according to Gina Martin Adams, a Wells Fargo & Co.
strategist.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows how the performance of the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Industrials Index this year compares with
the same period of 2012. Last year, the indicator peaked in
March and took almost nine months to surpass that high.  The group’s swings by comparison with the S&P 500 are
following “an eerily similar pattern,” Martin Adams wrote in a
report yesterday. She added that a relative performance index
fell below its 50-day moving average, a gauge of market trends,
at about the same time as it did in 2012.  In March, the S&P industrials index retreated after coming
within 4.5 percent of its peak. The earlier high was reached on
Oct. 9, 2007, the same day that the S&P 500 Index climbed to a
record -- one that was broken on March 28.  “Industrials top our list” of industries most at risk for
declines, the New York-based strategist wrote. Commodity
producers and financial stocks may head lower as well, she
added.  Martin Adams reiterated her forecast that the S&P 500 will
finish the year at 1,390, or 11 percent lower than yesterday’s
close. The estimate is the lowest among 17 strategists in a
Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
