Carlyle Group LP (CG) , the world’s
second-biggest private-equity firm, said the funds from which it
can collect a slice of profits appreciated 7 percent in the
first quarter and 11 percent in the past year.  So-called carry funds that invest in buyouts gained 9
percent in the quarter, Washington-based Carlyle said today in a
statement. That compares with the 10 percent increase in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large U.S. companies and the 6
percent advance for the MSCI All-Country World Index.  The firm, which oversaw $170 billion across 113 funds and
67 funds-of-funds as of Dec. 31, is set to report full earnings
for the first quarter next month. Carlyle held its  initial
public offering  last year and has disclosed preliminary fund
performance before its scheduled earnings reports to allow
stockholders to see the figures when its fund investors
typically do.  Carry funds in Carlyle’s real estate unit gained 1 percent
and those investing in energy increased 4 percent. The firm’s
Global Market Strategies funds appreciated 9 percent. GMS carry
funds, which invest in distressed companies and lend to middle-
sized companies as well as energy and power projects, gained 20
percent over the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
