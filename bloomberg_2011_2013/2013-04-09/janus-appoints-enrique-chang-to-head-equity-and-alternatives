Janus Capital Group Inc. (JNS)  named
Enrique Chang chief investment officer for equities and asset
allocation, a newly created role at the Denver-based money
manager.  Chang, 50, who joins Janus from Kansas City, Missouri-based
American Century Cos., will assume management of the equity
investment team, a role previously held by Jonathan Coleman, the
company said today in a statement. Coleman will focus solely on
 fund management  at his own request and has been named head of
growth equities, the company said.  Janus’s Chief Executive Officer Richard M. Weil has been
working to diversify the firm’s offerings beyond its traditional
focus on stocks. He has more than tripled the proportion of
Janus assets in fixed-income investments and last year began
rolling out a series of asset-allocation products designed to
limit risk for clients.  “Enrique has a proven track record of working
collaboratively with investment teams to ensure that portfolio
solutions are anticipating clients’ needs,” Weil said in the
statement.  Chang was chief investment officer at  American Century .
Janus manages about $157 billion for investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
