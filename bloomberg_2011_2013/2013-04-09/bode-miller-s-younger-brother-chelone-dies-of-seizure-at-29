Professional snowboarder Chelone
“Chilly” Miller, the younger brother of Olympic gold medal-
winning skier Bode Miller, died at age 29.  Chelone Miller, of Mammoth Lakes,  California , died on April
7 of a seizure that stemmed from a 2005 motorcycle accident that
left him in a coma for 11 days, U.S. Snowboarding said in a
 statement  on its website.  Chelone Miller had been focusing on snowboardcross in an
effort to qualify for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi,  Russia ,
and this year finished fourth in the Sprint U.S. Snowboarding
Grand Prix at Canyons, Utah. Last month he won the Rahlves
Banzai Tour overall title with a victory in Sugar Bowl,
California.  “Chelone Miller was an aspiring elite athlete who had made
great progress as a snowboardcross rider this past season,”
U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association President Bill Marolt said.
“We are all deeply saddened at the news of his death and extend
our condolences to the entire Miller family.”  Funeral arrangements are pending.  Bode Miller twice has been alpine skiing’s  World Cup 
overall champion, in 2005 and 2008, and won a gold medal in the
super combined at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. The U.S. men’s
record-holder with 33 World Cup victories, Miller, 35, is
sitting out this season as he recovers from knee surgery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
