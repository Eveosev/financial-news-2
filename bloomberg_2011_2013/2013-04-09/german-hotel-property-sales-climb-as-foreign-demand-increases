Sales of German hotels rose 44
percent in the first quarter as foreign investors sought safe
investments in  Europe ’s largest economy,  CBRE Group Inc. (CBG)  said.  About 605 million euros ($788 million) of hotels changed
hands, up from 420 million euros a year earlier, the Los-Angeles
based broker said in a statement today. The February acquisition
by Israel’s Fattal Hotels Company Ltd. of 20 Holiday Inn, Best
Western and Queens Hotels properties accounted for about half
the total.  “Due to favorable financing conditions,  Germany ’s status
as a safe haven, and increased demand from foreign investors, we
believe 2013 will be a strong year for hotels,” said Frederik
Schwaeppe, associate director of CBRE’s hotel brokerage in
Germany.  Germany’s economy is growing more than those of most other
European countries, attracting investors as interest rates in
the region hover near record lows. Prime hotels offer net
initial yields of more than 5 percent, Schwaeppe said. A German
10-year government bond yields about 1.3 percent.  Investment volumes this year will probably exceed 2012’s
level,  Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL)  said in a separate statement.
Investors are particularly interested in upscale and budget
hotels, the Chicago-based broker said.  CBRE estimates that 1.36 billion euros of hotel deals were
completed in Germany last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
