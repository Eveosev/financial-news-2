Gasoline needs to rebound above
$3.1425 a gallon to reverse a downtrend, according to a
 technical analysis  by T&K Futures & Options Inc.  The May contract has made a series of lower highs and lows
since reaching $3.3037 a gallon Feb. 19, with the latest high on
April 1. Since April 1, futures have tumbled as much as 9.3
percent to test support at the 200-day moving average. Prices
settled above the average, which was at $2.8831 yesterday, after
closing below that level April 5.  “The 200-day level is the last stand,”  Michael Smith ,
president of T&K in Port Saint Lucie,  Florida , said in an
interview yesterday. “It doesn’t mean much unless it rallies
back to where the whole fall began. You have to break above and
close above the April 1 high.”  If gasoline settles back below the 200-day average, it will
go all the way down and test support at the Dec. 7 intraday low
of $2.7578, Smith said.  The May gasoline contract rose 4.57 cents, or 1.6 percent,
to settle at $2.9093 a gallon yesterday on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange, the first increase in seven days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
