Mexico’s peso rose to the strongest
since August 2011 after a report showed faster-than-forecast
inflation last month, damping speculation that policy makers
will cut  interest rates  to slow the currency’s advance.  The peso rose 0.5 percent to 12.1366 at 8:51 a.m. in Mexico
City, the strongest level on a closing basis since Aug. 9, 2011.
Its 5.9 percent gain against the dollar in 2013 is the best
performance among the 16-most traded currencies tracked by
Bloomberg. Yields on benchmark local-currency bonds headed to
record lows.  Mexico’s peso jumped after the national statistics agency
said today that annual inflation accelerated to 4.25 percent in
March from 3.55 percent in February and above the 4.2 percent
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The report
damped speculation from some analysts that policy makers would
follow their 0.5 percentage point cut to the benchmark rate in
March with another reduction, according to  Rafael Camarena , an
economist at Grupo Financiero Santander Mexico SAB.  “Today’s inflation data that came in above expectations
reduced the possibility that  Banco de Mexico  could cut rates,”
Camarena said by phone from Mexico City.  Mexico’s currency commission said yesterday it was ending
daily dollar auctions in place since November 2011 designed to
shore up the peso, a sign policy makers are no longer concerned
about declines. Finance Minister Luis Videgaray said today in an
interview broadcast on Radio Formula that a free-floating peso
was best for Mexico and that policy makers sent a “clear
signal” that last month’s rate cut wasn’t the start of a cycle.  Inflation Yields  Yields on inflation-linked bonds known as Udibonos maturing
in December 2014 tumbled six basis points to 0.7 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Yields on  Mexico ’s peso bonds due in 2024 fell five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 4.76 percent today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the lowest ever on
a closing basis.  Mexico’s government plans to sell its first euro-
denominated bonds in almost three years and is offering to buy
back existing debt to benefit from plunging yields. The
government will sell 10-year bonds today and buy back euro bonds
due 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2020 on April 15, according to a
statement distributed by PR Newswire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
