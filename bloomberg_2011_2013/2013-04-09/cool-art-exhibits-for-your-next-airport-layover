We see nothing wrong with whiling away a layover in designer shops or over a couple of cocktails. But if you're looking for something a little more highbrow, you'll be happy to know that many airports use all that wall space to showcase art—think Rodin in Paris, Jan Steen in Amsterdam. Spot works from local artists in one of the San Diego Airport's four post-security gallery spaces. A few cool current exhibitions: " Trash? Look Again ," a mural made of reused odds and ends that visitors to the New Children's Museum created; " Birth of the New ," a series of abstract works by Kareem Ralph Amin; and " To Sit ," which looks at chairs as pieces of art. Take a look at where you're sitting: Benches scattered throughout the airport were hand-painted by artists from  After School Matters  gallery37, an apprenticeship program for local teens. A collection of Rodin works — including showstoppers  The Age of Bronze  and  The Kiss —are on display in  Terminal 2E  through the end of April. Translation: If you spent more time in Paris stuffing your face with chocolate croissants than touring museums, you can still go home with some cultural cred intact. Beatles fans, take note: Sir Peter Blake, the pop artist behind the Fab Four's  Sgt. Pepper  album art, created the paintings of London installed in Gatwick's North and South terminals. Count your blessings if you end up with a few hours to kill in Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport—not only does the place have  a library  and  an indoor park , but it also houses a satellite location of the city's famous Rijksmuseum, the first-ever airport to pull off such a stunt. The small permanent collection includes ten works from Dutch masters (Jan Steen, Jacob van Ruisdael), plus temporary exhibits rotate throughout the year.
