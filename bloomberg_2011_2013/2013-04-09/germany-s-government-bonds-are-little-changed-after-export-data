Germany’s government bonds were
little changed as a report showed the nation’s exports declined
in February.  Benchmark  10-year yields  were about five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, from the lowest level in more than seven
months. Exports, adjusted for working days and seasonal changes,
fell 1.5 percent from January, when they rose 1.3 percent, the
Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said. The Netherlands is
scheduled to sell as much as 2.5 billion euros ($3.26 billion)
of bonds maturing in January 2033, while Greece plans to auction
1 billion euros of six-month bills.  Germany’s 10-year bund yielded 1.25 percent as of 7:12 a.m.
London time. The rate dropped to 1.20 percent on April 5, the
 lowest  level since July 24. The price of the 1.5 percent
security maturing in February 2023 was at 102.335.  Germany’s imports dropped 3.8 percent in February and its
trade surplus increased to 16.8 billion euros from a revised
13.6 billion euros in January, the statistics office said.  The Netherlands last sold 20-year bonds on Sept. 25 at an
average yield on 2.497 percent. That compares with a  record-low
rate  of 2.342 percent set on June 12.  Finland’s Treasury plans to sell a new 10-year euro-
denominated benchmark security via banks. The bond may be sold
in the “next few days,” Deputy Funding Director Anu Sammallahti said by phone yesterday.  German bunds handed investors a return of 1.1 percent this
month through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Spanish bonds earned 4.8 percent, and Dutch
securities gained 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
