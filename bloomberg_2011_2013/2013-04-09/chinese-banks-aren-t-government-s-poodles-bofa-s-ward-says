Rodney Ward, chairman of  Asia 
corporate and investment banking at Bank of America Corp.,
comments on China’s banking industry. He spoke in an interview
with Bloomberg Television at the Boao Forum for Asia in  Hainan ,
China.  On criticism that lending is driven by the government:  “Increasingly they are asserting their independence. You
mustn’t say ‘In 2009 they did this big stimulus package, hence
they are poodles of the central government.’ I think that would
be overstating the case. In 2009 they’d only been independent,
in the case of  Bank of China , for three years. It’s difficult to
change the culture overnight. But what’s been interesting is
more recently, where they’ve been asked to do projects that they
did not have an appetite for, they’ve said no.”  On risks from shadow banking:  “If you look at the U.S., shadow banking did actually make
a major contribution to the financial meltdown. What was
striking in the U.S. was that the actual regulators didn’t see
it coming. So they were completely unprepared for it. If you
look at  China , it’s very very different. The Chinese are on top
of this.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
