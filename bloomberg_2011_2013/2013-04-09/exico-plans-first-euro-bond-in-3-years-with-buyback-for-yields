Mexico  plans to sell its first euro-
denominated bonds in almost three years and is offering to buy
back existing debt to benefit from plunging yields.  The government will sell 10-year bonds today and buy back
euro bonds due 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2020 on April 15, according
to a statement on PR Newswire today. The new debt may be priced
to yield about 135 basis points over the benchmark midswap rate,
or 2.97 percent, according to a person with knowledge of the
plans who asked not to be identified because the information
isn’t public.  Mexico’s yields have plunged from around 4.3 percent, or a
180 basis-point spread, for July 2017 bonds the last time the
government tapped the euro market in 2010. It joins  Turkey ,
Ukraine and Lebanon among governments tapping the market today.  The bond in euros looks “more interesting than dollars
right now because of spread pick up, but normally you also give
up some liquidity compared to dollar issues,” Lars Krabbe, who
manages about $3 billion in emerging market debt as a senior
portfolio manager at BankInvest Asset Management in Copenhagen,
said by e-mail.  The yield on Mexico’s dollar bonds due in March 2022 fell
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.51 percent as of
8:23 a.m. in  New York .  Tumbling borrowing costs are spurring governments to line
up bond sales this week. Ukraine is seeking to sell 10-year
dollar bonds at a yield of 7.5 percent to 7.625 percent,
according to a person familiar with the sale.  Lebanon, concluding investor meetings in  Beirut , is seeking
to increase its 2023 and 2027 dollar notes, a person with
knowledge of the offering said. Turkey is offering 30-year
dollar bonds, according to another person.  To contact the reporter on this story:
