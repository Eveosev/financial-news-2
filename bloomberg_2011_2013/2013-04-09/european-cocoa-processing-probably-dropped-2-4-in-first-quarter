Cocoa processing in  Europe , the
world’s biggest consuming region, probably dropped for a fifth
consecutive quarter after some factories stopped reporting while
others operated at slower rates.  The so-called grind, an indication of demand, was 2.4
percent lower in the first quarter than a year earlier,
according to the mean estimate of 14 traders, brokers and
processors surveyed by Bloomberg. Processing fell 6.2 percent in
the previous three months,  data  from the European Cocoa
Association showed. The Brussels-based industry group will
report figures for the first quarter on April 17. Europe
accounts for about 40 percent of the world’s global cocoa bean
processing, the  International Cocoa Organization  says.  Processing in the continent fell 16 percent in the third
quarter and 18 percent in the second quarter last year as some
factories slowed bean grinding because of lower margins. Fuchs &
Hoffmann GmbH, a grinder in  Germany , stopped reporting its
figures last year. The company is still not providing its
numbers, Managing Director Olaf Reichardt said yesterday. He
declined to provide the factory’s grinding capacity.  “The ECA survey probably will overstate the decline,”
Steven Haws, founder of Commodities Risk Analysis in Bethlehem,
 Pennsylvania , said by e-mail yesterday. “January to March 2012
was a strong quarter that preceded the factory closures still
with us. Further, several factories stopped reporting.”  World Grind  Cocoa bean processing in the first three months of 2012 was
353,311 metric tons, ECA data showed. A 2.4 percent decline
would imply that about 344,832 tons were processed in the first
quarter this year. Survey responses varied from a gain of 6.3
percent to a drop of 8 percent. World cocoa grinding will rise
1.5 percent to about 4 million tons in the 2012-13 season that
started in October, the ICCO estimates.  Global chocolate confectionary sales grew 1.5 percent from
September through January after being unchanged in the year-
earlier period, according to  earnings presentations  of  Barry
Callebaut AG (BARN) , which supplies chocolate to candy makers.  Sales in Western Europe climbed 1.4 percent in September
through January after falling 2.9 percent in the same period a
year earlier, the presentations of the Zurich-based company
show. In Eastern Europe, sales climbed 3.4 percent compared with
5.6 percent a year earlier, the presentations showed.  Cocoa for July delivery fell 0.2 percent to 1,468 pounds
($2,245) a ton by 9:43 a.m. in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
