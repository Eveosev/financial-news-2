First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the world’s
largest thin-film solar manufacturer, surged the most on record
after forecasting 2013 sales that would exceed estimates.  The shares gained 46 percent to $39.35 at the close in New
York, the biggest gain since the Tempe, Arizona-based company’s
November 2006 initial public offering.  First Solar anticipates sales of $3.8 billion to $4 billion
this year as it begins to recognize revenue for its Desert
Sunlight project in southern California, according to a
statement today.  The company expects revenue of about $12 billion over the
next three years, Chief Financial Officer Mark Widmar said at
the company’s analyst meeting today. That may reassure analysts
concerned the solar company is completing and selling large
solar farms faster than it’s winning orders for new ones. About
a third of that forecast is due to existing contracts and the
rest will come from anticipated sales, he said.  A portion of this year’s sales will come from the 550-
megawatt Desert Sunlight solar farm the company is building in
Southern  California .  “We’ll recognize about a third of Desert Sunlight this
year and two-thirds in 2014,” Widmar said.  Earnings will be $4 to $4.50 a share, exceeding the $3.57
average of 23 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Total shipments for the year will be 1.6 gigawatts to 1.8
gigawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
