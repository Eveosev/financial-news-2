Malta will push ahead with a
three-year program of income-tax cuts even as the government
seeks ways to bring its  budget deficit  below a European Union
limit, Finance Minister Edward Scicluna said.  The Mediterranean island nation’s 2012 budget shortfall
was equivalent to 3.3 percent of gross domestic product,
exceeding the  EU’s 3 percent target . Scicluna told lawmakers
in the capital, Valletta, last night that the government would
trim the deficit to 2.7 percent of GDP this year.  Scicluna, in his post for a month, said he’ll stick to
plans announced by the previous government to reduce the top
income-tax rate by 10 percentage points to 25 percent in three
years.  “We will keep the proposed tax cuts,” Scicluna said
today in televised remarks, reiterating comments made by Prime
Minister Joseph Muscat on April 5. “We are committed to
growth and we will implement the program.”  The European Commission forecasts the Maltese economy
will expand 1.5 percent this year and 2 percent in 2014.  The finance chief also said spending reviews will be
conducted for all government ministries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
