The chief executive officers of  NYSE
Euronext (NYX) ,  Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ)  and BATS Global Markets Inc. are
meeting with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission officials
to discuss migration of trading away from their venues into dark
pools, a person with knowledge of the meetings said.  The meetings in Washington today follow requests by the
exchanges that regulators consider measures to curb dark pools,
which let traders buy and sell large orders that aren’t publicly
displayed. Possible restrictions include a “trade-at” rule
that would allow dark pools to execute trades only if they
offered better prices than are available on exchanges.  SEC staff members didn’t commit to consider any new rules
and said the agency would continue to discuss the matter, said
the person, who requested anonymity because the meetings aren’t
public. SEC Commissioner Daniel Gallagher, one of two
Republicans on the five-member panel, said he planned to meet
with the CEOs of Nasdaq and BATS this afternoon.  “The numbers are pushing them to really want to refocus
regulatory attention,” Gallagher said. “If you look at the
market share of exchanges, the numbers are at all-time lows.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
