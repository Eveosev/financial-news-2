Jockey Ryan Mania, who was airlifted
to the hospital following a fall a day after winning the Grand
National, will be discharged this afternoon.  Mania was taken to  Newcastle upon Tyne  for medical
treatment after he was kicked in the back by his horse
Stagecoach Jasper during a hurdle race at Hexham in northeast
 England  two days ago.  The day before, the 23-year-old Scot had the biggest
triumph of his career when he rode 66-1 shot Auroras Encore to
victory in the Grand National steeplechase at Aintree.  Mania will leave the hospital after a scan on his back and
neck showed only minor injuries, his agent Bruce Jeffrey told
Press Association Sport.  “Ryan had his MRI scan this morning and it has shown up a
very small fracture in his C7 vertebra, and there is also some
soft tissue and ligament damage,” Jeffrey said.  “Delighted to be getting out today,” Mania wrote on
Twitter. “Looking forward to getting home to see friends and
family.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
