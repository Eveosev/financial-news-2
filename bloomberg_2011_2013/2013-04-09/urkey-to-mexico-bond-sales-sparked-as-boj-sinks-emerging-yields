Turkey ,  Mexico , Ukraine and Lebanon
are selling bonds as emerging-market nations take advantage of
the biggest drop in borrowing costs since 2008, triggered by
 Japan ’s stimulus measures.  Mexico priced its first issue of notes in euros in three
years today, while Turkey sold 30-year dollar debt, its longest
maturity since 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Ukraine issued dollar bonds a day before International Monetary
Fund officials leave the country. Lebanon’s Finance Ministry is
planning to sell more of its 2023 and 2027 dollar notes,
according to a person familiar with the offering.  Developing-government  yields  plunged to an average 4.56
percent late yesterday from 4.84 percent on April 1, the largest
proportional five-day decline since December 2008, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Diversified Index. For
investors, yields of 6.74 percent for Ukraine offer 601 basis
points, or 6.01 percentage points, more than U.S. Treasuries.  “There is essentially a growing belief that the current
ultra-low interest-rate environment is staying with us for quite
a while,” Robert Reichle, who manages $450 million in emerging-
market bonds as a senior portfolio manager at Joh. Berenberg
Gossler & Co. in Hamburg, said in e-mailed comments. “Investors
are looking for the highest yield they can get in fundamentally
sound countries, for a reasonable amount of risk -- Turkey and
Mexico are such an example.”  Kuroda Effect  Investors are pouring into  emerging markets  for higher
yields as  Bank of Japan (8301)  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda sets about
reviving the world’s third-biggest economy with an unprecedented
bond buying program.  Mexico sold 1.6 billion euros ($2.1 billion) of 10-year
bonds at a yield of 120 basis points above the benchmark mid-
swap rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The country will additionally buy back euro bonds due 2013,
2015, 2017 and 2020 on April 15, according to a statement on PR
Newswire today.  Mexico’s yields have plunged from around 4.3 percent, or a
180 basis point spread, for July 2017 bonds the last time the
government tapped the euro market in 2010.  Turkey issued $1.5 billion in 30-year notes to yield 4.95
percent. The rate on debt due in January 2041 has fallen 34
basis points this month to 4.83 percent. That compares with 6.61
percent at the end of January 2011, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Ukraine Mission  Ukraine raised $1.25 billion from bonds to yield of 7.5
percent, Bloomberg data show. The country, which raised the same
amount last November at a yield of 7.8 percent, is hosting an
IMF mission in  Kiev  this week for talks on a stand-by loan.  Lebanon held today a final round of investor meetings in
 Beirut  to reopen its 2023 and 2027 dollar bonds, according to
the person with knowledge of the sale, who asked not to be
identified because terms aren’t set. Separately, Lebanon’s
 Finance Ministry  said today it plans to issue as much as $1.5
billion of bonds in an exchange for local-currency debt with the
central bank.  Indonesia  raised $3 billion in 10- and 30-year dollar bonds
yesterday, tapping the global market for the first time this
year, Robert Pakpahan, director general at the debt management
office, said in an interview. The  Dominican Republic  is meeting
investors for a possible dollar bond sale, a person familiar
with the plans said.  While the proportional five-day drop in yield for
developing-nation debt was the most since 2008, the 28.5 basis
point decline was the biggest point retreat since October 2011,
JPMorgan indexes show.  “This is QE causing a flood of capital into emerging
markets,”  Tim McCarthy , who oversees more than $1 billion of
emerging-market assets at Valartis Asset Management in Geneva,
said by e-mail. “It could be a great month given the low
starting point after Cyprus knocked us down.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
