EcoMotors International, the fuel-
efficient engine maker backed by billionaires Bill Gates and
 Vinod Khosla , chose China as the location for its first factory,
which will be built with support from the automotive-parts
conglomerate Anhui Zhongding Holding Group Co.  Zhongding will invest more than $200 million to build the
plant in China’s Anhui province, Allen Park, Michigan-based
EcoMotors said today in a statement.  Closely held EcoMotors expects the plant to produce 150,000
engines a year starting in 2014, representing $1 billion of
potential revenue, Chief Executive Officer Don Runkle said in a
phone interview.  The deal “gives us a toehold in the biggest engine market
and fastest-growing engine market in the world,” Runkle said.  EcoMotors’s Opoc engine uses opposed pistons and cylinders
that improve fuel economy and lower greenhouse-gas emissions by
as much as 50 percent compared to conventional engines, Runkle
said. The company has talked to potential customers including
Airbus SAS,  Boeing Co. (BA)  and Generac Power Systems Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
