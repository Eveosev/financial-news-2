Dubai’s  benchmark stock index  surged
to the highest level in more than three years amid investor
speculation first-quarter corporate profits may beat estimates
and as banks repaid state loans ahead of time.  The  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  climbed 2.4 percent to 1,962.92, the
highest since November 2009, at the close in the emirate.  Dubai
Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB) , the biggest Shariah-compliant lender in the
 United Arab Emirates , advanced the most since December. 2009.
 Drake & Scull International (DSI)  PJSC rose to the highest since 2012
amid takeover speculation, which the company denied.  Dubai Islamic, which raised $1 billion in perpetual sukuk
last month to boost capital, has surged 17 percent since its
April 7 announcement that it repaid a 3.75 billion dirham ($1
billion) Finance Ministry loan it took during the global
financial crisis. Drake & Scull may report a 10 percent increase
in profit this year, after a 42 percent drop in 2012, according
to the mean estimate of nine analysts on Bloomberg.  “Dubai Islamic benefited a lot from the fact that they
were able to raise perpetual sukuk and then they paid back the
government’s bailout money,” said Mohammed Ali Yasin, managing
director of NBAD Securities in  Abu Dhabi . He also said there is
speculation that some companies, including Drake & Scull, may be
“taken over.”  No Talks  Drake & Scull, the Dubai-based company that supplies
engineering services to the  construction industry , isn’t subject
to any takeover bids, Zeina Tabari, chief corporate affairs
officer, said by phone after the market closed. The gain in
shares could be driven by investor optimism before first-quarter
results or expectations of future contracts.  The shares climbed 5.2 percent to 81.6 fils, the highest
