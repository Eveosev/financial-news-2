China , the world’s biggest wind
power market, posted a 41 percent surge in the production of
electricity from wind in 2012, bringing the nation a step closer
to meet its goal in three years.  The country generated 100.8 billion kilowatt-hours of wind
power last year, compared with 71.5 billion kilowatt-hours in
2011, the National Energy Administration said today in a
 statement  on its website. Total grid-connected installed
capacity increased 31 percent to 62.7 gigawatts from 47.9
gigawatts in 2011.  China said in August that it aims to install 100 gigawatts
of grid-connected wind farms by 2015 and to generate 190 billion
kilowatt-hours of power.  Wind energy has become the Asian nation’s third-biggest
energy resource, following coal and hydropower, and accounts for
about 2 percent of total electricity, according to data from
 China’s State Electricity Regulatory Commission .  To contact the reporter on this story:
