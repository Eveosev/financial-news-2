Hostess Brands Inc. won approval to
sell its Drake’s snack-cake brands to McKee Foods Corp., makers
of Little Debbie cakes.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain in White Plains, New
York, today approved the sale to McKee, which made the only
qualified bid for the brands. McKee will pay $27.5 million for
Drake’s products including Devil Dogs, Ring Dings, Yodels,
Yankee Doodles, Sunny Doodles, Funny Bones and Drake’s Coffee
Cake.  Drain also approved the sale of certain bread brands to
United States Bakery. The company will pay $30.9 million for the
Sweetheart, Eddy’s, Standish Farms and Grandma Emilie’s bread
brands, four bakeries and 14 depots, plus certain equipment.
Last month Drain approved sales to  Flowers Foods Inc. (FLO) ,  Grupo
Bimbo SAB (BIMBOA) ,  Apollo Global Management LLC (APO)  and  C. Dean Metropoulos
& Co.  for most of Hostess’s cake and bread brands.  Hostess, founded in 1930, is liquidating its brands,
recipes, plants and other assets after failing to reach an
agreement with striking bakers on concessions to help the
company emerge from its second bankruptcy.  The case is In re Hostess Brands Inc., 12-bk-22052, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (White Plains).  To contact the reporter on this story:
