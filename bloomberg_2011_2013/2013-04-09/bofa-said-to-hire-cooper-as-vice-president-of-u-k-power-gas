Jonny Cooper will join  Bank of
America Corp. ’s Merrill Lynch unit in  London  at the end of May
as a vice president trading U.K. power and natural gas,
according to two people familiar with the move.  He will report to Douglas Lawrence, head of EMEA gas and
power trading, the people said, declining to be identified
because the information isn’t public. Alex Parry, a spokeswoman
for Bank of America in London, declined to comment by telephone
yesterday.  Cooper left EDF Trading Ltd. as a U.K. power and gas trader
in London in March after working there for about five years,
Michele Reid, head of communications at EDFT, said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
