Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
state-run oil producer, advanced the most in three weeks after
Citigroup Inc. said the company could beat peers as lower oil
prices and a stronger real cut losses on imported fuel sales.  Shares of Petrobras, as the company is known, gained 2.4
percent to 17.82 reais at 11:46 a.m. in Sao Paulo. It was the
biggest contributor to the 0.9 percent advance in the 53-member
MSCI  Emerging Markets /Energy  Index. (MXEF0EN)  The benchmark Bovespa Index
rose 1.3 percent.  Recent weakness in oil prices and a stronger real have
reduced the gap between international gasoline and diesel prices
and those in Brazil, Citigroup analysts Pedro Medeiros and
Fernando Valle wrote yesterday in a note to clients. Under
government policy the company sells imported diesel at a
discount in the domestic market. The cost of fuel imports helped
send Petrobras  profits  to the lowest since 2004.  “Petrobras is one of  Brazil ’s most levered names to
appreciation of the Brazilian real,” the analysts wrote. The
company “benefits from higher fuel price margins on imports,
since fuel prices are set in domestic currency.”  Petrobras should gain if the exchange rate stays below 2
per dollar for the next 12 months, the analysts wrote. The
currency rose 0.4 percent to 1.9836 per dollar today, extending
this year’s gain to 3.4 percent.  Crude oil futures fell 4.7 percent in New York last week,
the most in six months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
