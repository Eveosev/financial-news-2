(Corrects parties issuing shares in second paragraph.)  SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. (SEAS) , the
aquatic theme-park operator owned by  Blackstone Group LP (BX) , is
seeking to raise as much as $540 million in its initial public
offering.  The company will offer 20 million shares at $24 to $27 a
piece, Orlando-based SeaWorld said today in a filing. Existing
shareholders are offering 10 million shares, while SeaWorld is
offering the rest. The share sale will be managed by Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of
America Corp., Barclays Plc and Wells Fargo & Co.  Proceeds from the sale will be used to redeem $140 million
in debt as well as pay a fee to an affiliate of Blackstone,
SeaWorld said. Shareholders may opt to sell an additional 3
million shares to raise as much as $81 million.  Blackstone, the world’s biggest private-equity firm, is
moving ahead with the IPO as soon as this month after rejecting
takeover bids for the theme-park operator, a person familiar
with the matter said last week. Apollo Global Management LLC and
Onex Corp. each made bids for Orlando-based SeaWorld, people
with knowledge of the matter said in February.  SeaWorld’s net proceeds from the sale will be approximately
$231.3 million based on the midpoint price range of $25.50 a
share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
