Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC) , the New
York-based telecommunications and entertainment provider, is
seeking a $1.9 billion  term loan  to repay debt, according to a
person with knowledge of the deal.  Bank of America Corp. is leading the transaction, which
will pay interest at 2.75 percentage points more than the London
interbank offered rate, with no floor on the lending benchmark,
said the person, who asked not to be identified because the
transaction is private.  The company may sell the debt at 99.5 cents on the dollar,
the person said. The seven-year loan will be used repay some of
the Bethpage, New York-based companyâ€™s outstanding borrowings.  Its $1.68 billion term slice due in March 2016 was quoted
at 100.6 cents on the dollar today, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. The company has about $4.6 billion  outstanding  in
loans maturing between 2015 and 2017, Bloomberg data show.  Lenders have until April 12 at noon in  New York  to submit
commitments, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
