AGL Energy Ltd. (AGK) , operator of the A$1
billion ($1 billion) Macarthur wind farm in  Australia ’s Victoria
state, said the project reached full capacity of 420 megawatts
for the first time at the end of March.  Macarthur, the largest wind farm in the southern
hemisphere, has generated the equivalent of one year’s
electricity supply to more than 40,000 households and started
operating fully at the end of January, Sydney-based AGL said
today in an e-mail response to questions.  With the Macarthur project, AGL and partner Meridian Energy
Ltd. are contributing to the Australian government’s program to
generate 20 percent of the country’s power from renewable energy
by the end of the decade.  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  of Denmark is
providing turbines to the wind farm.  AGL, Australia’s biggest owner of renewable energy
projects, and  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  last year won A$129.7 million in
government funds to build a 159-megawatt solar project across
two sites in New South Wales state. AGL also plans the Silverton
wind farm in New South Wales that has a potential capacity of as
much as 1,000 megawatts, its website shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
