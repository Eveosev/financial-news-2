B&A Mineracao SA, the venture
between  Andre Esteves ’s Grupo BTG Pactual SA and former head of
 Vale SA (VALE5)   Roger Agnelli , may buy a company in the next three
months after purchasing copper and fertilizers assets.  B&A is evaluating five possible deals, Chief Executive
Officer Eduardo Ledsham said during an interview in Santiago
today. The company is analyzing both listed and private
companies, he said, declining to name the targets.  Agnelli and BTG, the Brazilian investment bank led by
billionaire Esteves, started B&A last year to invest as much as
$520 million in projects including copper, iron ore, phosphate
and titanium in Latin America and Africa. The company in March
completed the acquisition of Toronto-based Rio Verde Minerals
Development Corp. after gaining control of Cuprum Resources
Corp., a closely held company with assets in Chile.  “It’s evolving, but we still don’t have anything
definitive,” Ledsham said about the possible acquisitions. “We
need to deliver on what we bought.”  Cuprum will start implementing a copper project to initiate
production in November 2014 with 15,000 metric tons of capacity,
Ledsham said during the interview, on the sidelines of CRU’s
12th World Copper Conference. In November, phosphate unit Rio
Verde is scheduled to start operating a 150,000-ton-per-year
project in northern Brazil, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
