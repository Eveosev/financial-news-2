Inventories at U.S. wholesalers fell
unexpectedly in February as uncertainty about U.S. fiscal policy
kept business spending in check.  The 0.3 percent decrease in stockpiles followed a revised
0.8 percent gain in January that was less than originally
reported, the Commerce Department said today in  Washington . The
median forecast in a Bloomberg  survey  called for a 0.5 percent
gain. Sales rose 1.7 percent in February after falling 0.8
percent the prior month.  At the current pace of sales, wholesalers had enough goods
on hand to last 1.19 months, down from 1.21 months in January,
the report showed.  The median forecast for wholesale inventories was based on
a  Bloomberg survey  of 29 economists. Estimates ranged from
increases of 0.2 percent to 1.4 percent. The drop in inventories
was the biggest since a 0.7 percent decline in September 2011.  Wholesalers’ stockpiles of durable goods, or those meant to
last several years, increased 0.2 percent, boosted by business
equipment, according to today’s report.  The value of unsold non-durable goods fell 0.9 percent, led
by pharmaceuticals and agriculture products.  The sales gain was led by a 10.6 percent increase in
petroleum.  Wholesalers, which make up about 30 percent of all business
stockpiles, might be feeling the effects of improved  consumer
confidence  as Americans looked beyond budget rancor in Congress
and continued to spend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
