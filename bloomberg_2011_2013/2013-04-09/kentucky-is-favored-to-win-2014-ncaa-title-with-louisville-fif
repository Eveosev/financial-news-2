The odds for the 2014 men’s college
basketball championship were out minutes after the University of
Louisville celebration began, with the Cardinals’ instate rivals
from the University of  Kentucky  as next year’s favorites.  Louisville won its third title last night with an 82-76
victory over the University of Michigan at the Georgia Dome in
Atlanta, becoming the eighth school to capture more than two
championships. UCLA ranks first all-time with 11 men’s titles,
followed by Kentucky with eight.  The Wildcats, who missed this year’s National Collegiate
Athletic Association tournament after winning the 2012 title,
are listed as the 4-1 favorites to claim a ninth championship,
according to handicapping information website  Pregame.com .  Louisville is the fifth choice at 12-1, with Duke and North
Carolina at 8-1 and Ohio State listed at 9-1.  Louisville entered this season as the 7-1 second-favorite,
according to the Las Vegas Hotel’s Super Book, behind only
Indiana University (6-1). The Cardinals went 35-5, setting a
school record for wins, and finished the season with a 16-game
winning streak as Rick Pitino became the first men’s coach to
win titles at two different schools.  Pitino’s previous title came at Kentucky in 1996 and the
Wildcats, now coached by John Calipari, are bringing in a
recruiting class that includes the nation’s No. 1 high school
prospects at point guard, shooting guard, center and power
forward, according to ESPN. Six Kentucky recruits are in the top
100 of  ESPN’s rankings .  To contact the reporter on this story:
