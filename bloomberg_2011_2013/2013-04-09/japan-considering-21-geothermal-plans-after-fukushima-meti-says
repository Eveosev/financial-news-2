Japan  is considering at least 21
geothermal projects as it searches for alternative energy
sources after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident, according to
data compiled by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.  Incentives for clean energy, including above-market rates
for power derived from underground sources regardless of plant
size, are encouraging the projects, Shinichiro Fukushima, an
official in charge of geothermal energy at the ministry, said at
a briefing in Tokyo today. The 21 possible projects include
seven where small-sized binary turbines may be used, he said.  Before Fukushima and the beginning of the incentive program
in July, Japan’s geothermal power development was mainly
comprised of large-scale projects concentrated in the Hokkaido
and Tohoku regions in northern Japan as well as the southern
island of Kyushu, Fukushima said.  “Even very small projects are now worth the cost with the
introduction of feed-in tariffs,” he said.  Japan has 17 geothermal plants currently in operation with
a total capacity of 520 megawatts, according to the ministry.
The 21 projects now under consideration are at different stages
of research, Fukushima said.  Officials are conducting studies to determine the capacity
for the projects, according to the ministry.  The feed-in tariff for geothermal is 27.3 yen per kilowatt
hour for plants with capacity of 15,000 kilowatts or larger, and
42 yen for smaller plants, both for 15 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
