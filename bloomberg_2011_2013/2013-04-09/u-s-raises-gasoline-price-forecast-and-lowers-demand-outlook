U.S. consumers will pay an average 6
cents a gallon less for gasoline this summer than a year ago,
according to a forecast by the Energy Information
Administration.  The EIA expects regular-grade gasoline will average $3.63 a
gallon from April through September, down from $3.69 a gallon in
2012, the statistical arm of the Energy Department said today in
its monthly  Short-Term Energy Outlook . Diesel fuel averages will
drop 1 cent to $3.94 a gallon.  Lower crude prices will keep motorists’ costs in check,
according to the EIA. Brent, the pricing basis for U.S. oil
imports, is down 14 percent from a year ago, while West Texas
Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, has dropped 7.9 percent.
Regular gasoline is 33.1 cents a gallon below a year earlier,
lowest for this season in three years, the EIA said yesterday.  “U.S. drivers are expected to pay less for gasoline this
summer, on average down 6 cents per gallon from last summer, due
in large part to slightly lower crude oil prices that account
for 65 percent of the pump price,” Adam Sieminski, the EIA’s
administrator, said in an e-mailed statement.  The EIA raised its forecast for gasoline prices at the pump
for all of 2013 and reduced its estimate for demand.  Regular-grade gasoline will average $3.56 a gallon this
year, up from last month’s forecast of $3.55,  Prices in 2012
averaged $3.63 a gallon.  Prices may average $3.39 in 2014, the department estimated,
up from $3.38 in last month’s forecast.  Gasoline  consumption  this year will average 8.69 million
barrels a day, down from 8.71 million in last month’s
projection. Demand in 2014 may be 8.7 million barrels a day,
down from last month’s forecast of 8.71 million.  Distillate demand, including diesel and heating oil, will
be 3.79 million barrels a day this year, up from last month’s
outlook of 3.75 million. Consumption in 2014 is estimated to be
3.81 million barrels a day, unchanged from the previous
projection.  To contact the reporters on this story:
