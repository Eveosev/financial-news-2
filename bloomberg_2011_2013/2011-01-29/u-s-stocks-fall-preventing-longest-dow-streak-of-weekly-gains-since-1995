U.S. stocks slid, preventing the
longest stretch of weekly gains for the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  since 1995, as unrest in Egypt triggered the biggest
one-day drop since November and overshadowed higher-than-
projected earnings at companies from  Intel Corp . to DuPont Co.    Ford Motor Co . and  Amazon.com Inc . lost more than 3.5
percent after their earnings and forecast, respectively, missed
estimates. American Express Co., Bank of America Corp. and
Johnson & Johnson posted weekly losses exceeding 4.2 percent
after protesters in Egypt challenged  Hosni Mubarak ’s 30-year
presidency. Intel and DuPont climbed at least 3 percent.  The Dow lost 48.14 points, or 0.4 percent, to 11,823.70
this week, after twice rising above 12,000 for the first time
since 2008. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index decreased 0.6
percent to 1,276.34.  “We’ve enjoyed such a nice upside over the last month and
a half that perhaps those who are long stocks might be a little
bit more hypersensitive,” said Joe “JJ” Kinahan, the chief
derivatives strategist at Omaha, Nebraska-based TD Ameritrade
Holding Corp. “This is a healthy trade. A market that goes
straight up is not necessarily a healthy market, but one that
bounces its way up usually can lead to longer-term gains.”  The  S&amp;P 500  has surged 22 percent since Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said Aug. 27 that he was prepared to
take action to help the economy. The Fed last week maintained
its plan to buy $600 billion in Treasuries to stimulate growth.  Echoes of April  Some technical indicators suggested that stocks are poised
for a pullback. More than 80 percent of stocks traded above
their 200-day moving average this week, according to Birinyi
Associates Inc. The last time that many were so high was in
April, before the S&P 500 began a decline in which it lost as
much as 16 percent. A measure of the degree to which S&P 500
gains outpace losses, known as the relative strength index,
jumped to 71.8 this week. The RSI exceeded 70 for five straight
days through April 15, before the S&P 500 peaked.  The Dow was set for its longest weekly gaining streak since
1995 until yesterday, when the index slumped 1.4 percent after
Mubarak implemented a curfew in Cairo, Suez and Alexandria and
fighting between police and protesters broke out. The S&P 500
dropped 1.8 percent that day, with Ford and Amazon’s earnings
also pulling stocks lower.  ‘Priced for Perfection’  “Geopolitical concerns in the Middle East are weighing on
sentiment,” said Ryan Larson, head of U.S. equity trading at
RBC Global Asset Management Inc. The U.S. economic expansion is
“coming at a slower pace than expected. The market has been
priced for perfection for a while.”  Concerns about  Egypt  yesterday overshadowed a report
showing the U.S. expanded 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter.
Household purchases, about 70 percent of the economy, rose at a
4.4 percent pace, the most since the first quarter of 2006,
signaling the world’s largest economy and consumers are
recovering from the worst recession since World War II. New-home
purchases in the U.S. also rose more than forecast last month,
Commerce Department figures showed last week.  Ford, the second-largest U.S. automaker, slipped 9.4
percent last week to $16.27. The Dearborn, Michigan-based
company’s fourth-quarter profit plunged 79 percent as its
European unit had an unexpected loss and new models drove up its
costs. Amazon.com, the largest online retailer, forecast first-
quarter profit that may be lower than analysts predict.  American Express    American Express Co . fell 4.7 percent to $43.86. Excluding
the fourth-quarter charge, the biggest credit-card issuer by
purchases earned 94 cents a share, less than the average
estimate of 96 cents by analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Overall, companies in the S&P 500 also continued to post
better-than-estimated earnings this season, with 136 of the 183
companies that have reported so far, or 74 percent, beating
projections. Technology companies have exceeded forecasts by 16
percent, the highest of any other industry. A group of computer
and software stocks advanced 0.6 percent this week, the third-
best of 10 industries in the S&P 500.  Corning, the world’s biggest maker of glass for flat-panel
televisions, rose 13 percent to $21.80 after it said fourth-
quarter sales beat the average analyst estimate. Teradyne gained
18 percent to $16.23 after it forecast first-quarter profit
would be higher than analysts estimate after the maker of
testing equipment for electronics posted fourth-quarter results
that surpassed projections.  Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, added $10 billion to
its buyback plan. The shares rose 3.1 percent, the most since
the week of Nov. 5, to $21.46.  Earnings Are ‘Key’  “While sentiment plays an important factor in the short
run, earnings are the key driver,” Wasif Latif, vice president
of equity investment at USAA Investment Management Co., which
oversees $46 billion in  San Antonio , said in a Bloomberg
Television interview. This “is not necessarily the season where
the market is looking for top-line growth. If it’s coming that’s
great, but generally speaking, as long as earnings are beating
and margins are sustaining themselves, that’s been fine.”  While technology stocks have outperformed their profit
estimates, stocks of companies that depend on the discretionary
spending of Americans are disappointing analysts more than any
other industry, missing earnings-per-share estimates by 11
percent so far this reporting season. In addition to Ford, D.R.
Horton Inc., the second-largest U.S. homebuilder by stock-market
value, reported a loss wider than analysts expected.  A group of discretionary stocks slid 1.7 percent, the
second-most in the S&P 500, last week. Health-care shares
dropped the most, shedding 1.8 percent.  Celgene Corp. fell 8.7 percent to $51.18 after results
matched estimates. Johnson & Johnson, the maker of Rolaids and
Tylenol, declined 4.2 percent to $60.01 after saying it
anticipates “significant costs” and may order more recalls
this year.  Abbott Laboratories , maker of the rheumatoid
arthritis drug Humira, retreated 5.1 percent to $45.49 after it
said it will cut about 1,900 jobs as part of a restructuring.  Monster Worldwide Inc. and Tellabs Inc. slid after they
announced forecasts that fell short of analysts’ projections.
Monster lost 26 percent to $15.95, while Tellabs dropped 21
percent to $5.38.  To contact the reporter on this story:
