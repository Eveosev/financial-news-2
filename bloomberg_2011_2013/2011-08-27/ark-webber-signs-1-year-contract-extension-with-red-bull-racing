Mark Webber  signed a one-year
contract with Red Bull Racing, keeping him with the team for the
2012 Formula One season.  Webber, who turned 35 today, had his best season in 2010, 
winning four times and finishing third in the championship behind 
teammate Sebastian Vettel and Ferrari’s  Fernando Alonso .  “I want to continue racing at the top in Formula One so
it’s a no-brainer to remain at Red Bull for another year,”
Webber said in a statement.  Webber, who joined Red Bull from Williams in 2007, is
second to Vettel in this season’s standings going into
tomorrow’s Belgian Grand Prix.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
