Denmark’s Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen is considered best at handling an economic crisis by
44 percent of voters interviewed in a Megafon poll, published by
 Politiken  late yesterday.  The survey, which didn’t indicate how many people were
questioned, showed that 31 percent believed Helle Thorning- Schmidt, the leader of the opposition party Social Democrats, is
best at dealing with an economic crisis.  Rasmussen yesterday called an early election after failing
to secure majority lawmaker backing for his economic stimulus
package. Danes go to the polls on Sept. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
