Air Canada (AC/A)  flight attendants
rejected a tentative agreement their union reached with the
nation’s largest airline.  Members of the Canadian Union of Public Employees voted 88
percent against ratifying the agreement, the union said in a
statement issued by Canada Newswire. Turnout for the vote was 79
percent, CUPE said.  “We negotiated the best deal we felt we could in the
current political context,” said union president Jeff Taylor.
“It wasn’t enough and we will take that message back to the
employer.”  Air Canada said in a separate statement that it doesn’t
expect business to be interrupted by the rejection. The
tentative deal was reached Aug. 1. CUPE represents about 6,800
flight attendants, whose contract expired March 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
