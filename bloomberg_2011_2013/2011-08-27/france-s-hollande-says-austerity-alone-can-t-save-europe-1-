Francois Hollande , a contender for
the French Socialist Party’s 2012 presidential nomination, said
austerity alone can’t save  Europe , adding that the euro zone
needs economic growth to survive.  Speaking on the second day of the party’s gathering in the
port city of La Rochelle in western France, Hollande said
Germany, the euro region’s largest economy, can’t prosper if
other members don’t.  “We tell our German friends that their prosperity can’t be
built on the ruin of other countries,” he told party
supporters. “The euro zone won’t survive if there is no growth.
If the economic model is solely based on austerity, it won’t
work.”  The “anguish and the stress” caused by austerity and an
austerity-only policy may push voters to extremes political
parties, he said.  French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  this week bid to defend
France’s top credit rating by raising taxes on companies and the
wealthiest as he aimed to limit the fallout of budget cuts and a
slowing economy in an election year.  Prime Minister  Francois Fillon  announced 12 billion euros
($17 billion) of measures in 2011 and 2012 and cut growth
forecasts, saying the euro region’s second-largest economy will
expand less than 2 percent in each year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
