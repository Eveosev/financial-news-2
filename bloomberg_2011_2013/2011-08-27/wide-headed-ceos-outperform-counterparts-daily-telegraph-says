(Corrects name in second paragraph of story originally
published Aug. 27)  Chief executive officers with wide
heads perform better financially than those with long faces, the
 Daily Telegraph  reported, citing a study in the journal
Psychological Science.  Men with wider faces tend to have higher testosterone
levels, making them more aggressive, which explains the link
between face shape and company performance, the Daily Telegraph
said, citing the research by Elaine Wong from the University of
Wisconsin-Milwaukee and colleagues, who looked at CEO faces and
financial performance of 55 Fortune 500 companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
