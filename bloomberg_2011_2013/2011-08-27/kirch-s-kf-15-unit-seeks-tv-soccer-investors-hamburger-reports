Deceased German entrepreneur  Leo Kirch ’s KF 15 GmbH unit seeks investors to help it bid for
broadcast rights for  Germany ’s premier soccer league for the
2012-2013 season, the  Hamburger Abendblatt  newspaper said.  A bid by the company to acquire broadcast rights for the
2007 season was thwarted by Germany’s antitrust office but it
now plans a strategy that complies with the law, the newspaper
said today, without citing anyone. KF 15 is run by Kirch’s widow
Ruth and his son Dieter Hahn, the newspaper said.  Telephone calls made today to KF 15’s Munich offices went
unanswered.  To contact the reporters on this story:
