Comet, the retail chain owned by
 Kesa Electricals Plc (KESA) , may have to offer a “dowry” to cover
pension and lease liabilities as second-round bids for the
money-losing company are set to be submitted next week, the
Financial Times reported, citing people familiar with the
auction process. Restructuring firm Hilco and OpCapita LLP are
expected to be the most-credible buyers, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
