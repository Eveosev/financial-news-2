George Economou, the Greek shipowner
who had at least one vessel seized from China Cosco Holdings Co.
in a contract-payment dispute, is still in talks with the state-
controlled sea-cargo group, the Financial Times reported.  “We are still in ongoing discussions,” Economou was
reported as saying to the newspaper yesterday. The chief
executive officer of DryShips Inc. has about 18 vessels on lease
to China Cosco, which was late on payments on some long-term
contracts following a plunge in rates.  China Cosco General Manager Zhang Liang told reporters in
 Hong Kong  yesterday that the company reached agreements with
owners covering 18 ships.  Asia ’s largest operator of container
vessels had 201 chartered commodity ships as of June 30,
according to its earnings statement.  Liang declined to comment on the terms of the accords or on
whether talks were under way about any other contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
