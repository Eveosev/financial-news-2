Electrolux AB (ELUXB)  will maintain its
operations in the U.S., the  Wall Street Journal  reported
yesterday, citing the company’s finance chief for the North
American appliances division, Robbert Kaufman.  Kaufman told the newspaper that the company’s decision to
close a facility in  Iowa  and move production to Mexico was based
on cost, distribution and supplier base.  While the North American market is a mature market for
Electrolux, the company still sees significant growth potential
in a variety of product lines, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
