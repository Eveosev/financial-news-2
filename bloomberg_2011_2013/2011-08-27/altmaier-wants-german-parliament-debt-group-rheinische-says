The German parliament should set up
a cross-party group of experts to speed up decision-making in
the debt crisis, said  Peter Altmaier , the chief whip in German
Chancellor’s Christian Democrat bloc, in an interview in today’s
 Rheinische Post  newspaper.  Parliament is drawing up legislation to expand the
temporary euro-region rescue fund and to create its permanent
successor and needs a “specialist parliamentary group that can
deliver advice promptly,” he was cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
