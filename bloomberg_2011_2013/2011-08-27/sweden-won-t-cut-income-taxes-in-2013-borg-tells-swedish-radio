Sweden  won’t be able to cut income
taxes in 2013, Finance Minister Anders Borg told Swedish Radio
in an interview published on the broadcaster’s website today.  Borg said it isn’t realistic today to think that Sweden
will have enough budget revenue to allow for tax cuts in 2013.
As the figures look now, there will be no room for income tax
cuts, he said.  The finance minister also criticized Swedbank AB’s share
buyback program, given the economic circumstances. Paying out
capital in the current situation is highly questionable, Borg
said.  To contact the reporter:
