McLaren Automotive Ltd., a unit of
the company that owns the most successful Formula One team after
Ferrari, is more than halfway to converting all its debt to
equity, the Financial Times reported, citing chief executive
officer Ron Dennis.  The company has nearly 1,900 orders for its MP4-12C, which
starts at 168,500 euros ($244,300), according to the FT. McLaren
has raised more than 60 percent of the 260 million euros it was
seeking from investors after securing an investment from
Singapore billionaire Peter Lim, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
