Euro region states that tap aid in
the debt crisis should sell gold reserves and buy back their
sovereign debt,  Michael Fuchs , a lawmaker from German Chancellor
Angela Merkelâ€™s  Christian Democrats , was cited as saying by
 Wirtschaftswoche .  In an interview to be published tomorrow by the business
weekly, Fuchs said such a step is preferable to the bond buying
progam of the European Central Bank. Such a step would also be
suitable for Italy, which controls large gold reserves though
has not tapped aid, he was cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
