Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully,
who was at the microphone for New York Yankee pitcher Don Larsen’s perfect game in the 1956  World Series , will return to
the booth in 2012 for a 63rd season of calling the Los Angeles
Dodgers games.  “After a lot of soul searching and a few prayers, we’ve
decided that we will come back with the Dodgers for next year,”
Scully said last night during the Dodgers’ home game against
 Colorado . “God’s been awfully good to me, allowing me to do the
things I love to do. I asked him one more year at least and he
said okay.”  Scully’s 62 years of service represent the longest tenure
of any broadcaster in sports history, the Dodgers said.  The 83-year-old began his professional baseball
broadcasting career in 1950 with the  Brooklyn Dodgers  and was
inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982. During
his career, he has called three perfect games, 19 no-hitters, 25
World Series and 12 All-Star Games.  Among the highlights Scully described for fans were Kirk Gibson’s winning Game 1 homer in the 1988 World Series, Hank Aaron’s record-setting 715th home run,  Barry Bonds ’s record-
breaking 71st, 72nd and 73rd home runs and the scoreless-inning
streaks’ of Dodger pitchers Don Drysdale and Orel Hershiser.  To contact the reporter on this story:
