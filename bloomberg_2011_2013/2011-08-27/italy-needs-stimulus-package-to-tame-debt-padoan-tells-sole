Italy  needs to adopt a growth
stimulus package as fiscal measures aren’t enough to tame its
debt, Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development, told daily  Il Sole 24 Ore .  Italy has to address “the causes of its high public debt,
it can’t live forever with a debt of that dimension,” Padoan
said in the interview with Sole.  On the purchase by the  European Central Bank  of bonds of
countries including Italy, Padoan said that it’s a “temporary”
measure that has to be followed by a long-term strategy, Sole
reported.  To contact the reporters on this story:
