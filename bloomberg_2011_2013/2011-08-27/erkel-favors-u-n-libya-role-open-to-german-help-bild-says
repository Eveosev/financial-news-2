German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
favors the United Nations, Arab League and African Union taking
the lead in creating sustainable peace in Libya, the  Bild-am-
Sonntag  newspaper reported.  In an interview published tomorrow, Merkel defended
 Germany ’s decision not to join its allies in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization in giving military support to Libya’s
rebels. Germany would if asked consider participating in any
peacetime role of the U.N., she is cited as saying.  “If we Germans are asked, of course we will ask ourselves
what we could do,” Merkel said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
