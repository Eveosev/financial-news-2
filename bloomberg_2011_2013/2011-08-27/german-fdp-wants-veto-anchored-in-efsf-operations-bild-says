Germany ’s Free Democratic Party,
Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s coalition partner, wants veto rights
to be set in a national bill being drawn up to expand the scope
of the euro region’s rescue fund,  Bild Zeitung  said.  The German parliament must have the right to approve all
aid petitions made to the rescue fund and the weight of its
decisions to be reflected in the fund’s actions, the newspaper
reported today, citing unidentified FDP officials.  If a petition fails to gain a clear parliamentary majority
Germany’s representative on the fund’s ruling board must be
forced to reject the petition rather than abstain, Bild
reported, citing the officials.  The Germany government aims to have the bill to expand the
toolbox of the European Financial Stability Facility on the
statute books by the end of September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
