Kazakhstan , central  Asia ’s biggest
energy producer, forecast its oil fund assets to jump to $72.5
billion by 2015.  The assets will grow to at least 30.4 percent of
Kazakhstan’s gross domestic product, said  Economic Development 
and Trade Minister  Kairat Kelimbetov , according to a copy of his
speech e-mailed by the ministry today.  The nation’s oil fund assets rose to $38.7 billion in July,
according to the central bank’s website. Kazakhstan, which holds
about 3 percent of the world’s oil reserves according to BP Plc,
created the fund in 2000 to guard against declines in the price
of crude.  The government plans to transfer 1.2 trillion tenge ($8.2
billion) a year from the oil fund to the budget from next year
through 2014, Kelimbetov said.  Kazakhstan’s nominal GDP is expected to grow from 28.9
trillion tenge next year to 44.7 trillion tenge by 2017,
Kelimbetov said. Exports will rise from $75.7 billion in 2012 to
$105.8 billion in 2016, while imports will increase from $40.9
billion in 2012 to $60 billion in 2016, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
