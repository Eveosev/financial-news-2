Seadrill Ltd. (SDRL)  bought a stake of
about 5 percent in Aker Drilling ASA days before Transocean Ltd.
agreed to buy the company,  Dagens Naeringsliv  reported, citing
Seadrill Chief Executive Alf Thorkildsen.  Seadrill, which made a profit of 150 million kroner ($28
million) on the stake, bought the shares via an account at DnB
NOR ASA, thereby remaining undisclosed, the Oslo-based newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
