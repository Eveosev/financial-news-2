German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said parliament can decide the scope of its role in
determining future euro-region rescue aid,  Tagesspiegel 
reported.  In an interview to be published tomorrow, Schaeuble said a
 law  passed in May last year upholds lawmakers’ right to
participate in aid decisions. Lawmakers can amend the law as
they see fit, he is cited as saying.  Germany  is preparing legislation to expand the tool kit of
the European Financial Stability Facility that has prompted
concern that Schaeuble aims in the bill to curb parliament’s
control over federal spending.  “We need to find a sensible balance between the EFSF and
parliament’s justifiable need to co-determine the concrete
exercise of the EFSF’s work,” Schaeuble said. “I am with heart
and soul a parliamentarian.”  Schaeuble said he is “confident” of finding a majority in
the ruling coalition to back the EFSF bill as well as gain an
overall majority in a plenary vote in parliament at the end of
September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
