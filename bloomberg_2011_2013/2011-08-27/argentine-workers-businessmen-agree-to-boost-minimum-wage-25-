Argentine workers’  minimum wage  will
rise by 25 percent, following an agreement between government
officials, labor unions and business leaders last night,
according to a  presidential statement .  The new minimum wage will be 2,300 pesos ($549.71) per
month, from the previous $1,800, President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  announced, according to the statement. The agreement
shows that businessmen and union and government officials “live
up to the expectations society has for them,” Fernandez said.  The minimum salary has increased 820 percent since 2002,
the government said earlier this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
