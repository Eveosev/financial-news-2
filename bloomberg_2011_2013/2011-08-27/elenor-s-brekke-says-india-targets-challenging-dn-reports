Sigve Brekke, chief executive of
Uninor,  Telenor ASA (TEL) ’s Indian venture, told  Dagens Naeringsliv 
that achieving positive earnings before interest, tax,
amortization and depreciation by 2013 and a positive cash flow
by 2015 is “a challenge.”  Telenor hasn’t given up these targets, Brekke said. The
company’s investments in  India  shouldn’t exceed 18.6 billion
kroner ($3.5 billion), according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
