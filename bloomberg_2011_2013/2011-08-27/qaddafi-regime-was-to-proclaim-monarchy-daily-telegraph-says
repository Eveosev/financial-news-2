Libya ’s Muammar Qaddafi’s regime was
set to proclaim him king or emperor once it reclaimed the
country from rebels, the  Daily Telegraph  reported, citing papers
it uncovered from Prime Minister Baghdadi al Mahmudi’s abandoned
Tripoli office. The document found by the newspaper was dated
July 15 and set out a strategy to mobilize Libya’s tribes to re-
establish the regime’s control over the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
