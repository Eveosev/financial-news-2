Group Eurotunnel SA, the operator of
the undersea rail tunnel linking Britain and  France , is bracing
for a strike after talks over wages with French labor unions
failed.  Unions have gathered this morning to determine a course of
action after their demand for an additional monthly wage payment
a year was rejected by the company. In all-day negotiations
yesterday, unions asked for a bonus of 3,000 euros ($4,350) per
employee, which was turned down by management, Fabienne Lissak,
a spokeswoman for the Paris-based company said.  “Their demands are unrealistic in the current economic
climate,” she said in an interview.  Eurotunnel services are functioning at a normal level this
morning and the company, which transports passengers, cars and
trucks through the tunnel on shuttle trains between terminals at
Calais, France and Folkestone,  England , will operate regular
service throughout the weekend, she said.  “We are doing everything we can to ensure that clients are
not penalized,” she said.  Eurotunnel offered a bonus of 200 euros per employee, a
proposal rejected by unions, Lissak said. The company has left
the door open for further negotiations on variable compensation,
she said.  Andre Milan, a spokesman for the transport wing of the
 Confederation Francaise Democratique du Travail  union, didn’t
immediately return a call seeking a comment.  Eurostar Group Ltd. , a separate company whose high-speed
passenger trains use the tunnel to link  London  with Paris and
Brussels, said today on its  website  that its services won’t be
affected by a Eurotunnel strike.  To contact the reporter on this story:
