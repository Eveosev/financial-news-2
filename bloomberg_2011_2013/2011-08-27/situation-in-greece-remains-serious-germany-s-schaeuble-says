German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said the budgetary situation in Greece “remains
serious.”  Euro region states that have tapped aid to ease their debt
woes still need time for economic and financial reforms to take
effect, Schaeuble said today in a speech in  St. Gallen ,
Switzerland. Heaping up further sovereign debt will stunt
economic growth rather than stimulate economies, he said.  The global economy, impacted by debt problems from the U.S.
to Europe and Japan, may face as much as seven “lean years,”
Schaeuble added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
