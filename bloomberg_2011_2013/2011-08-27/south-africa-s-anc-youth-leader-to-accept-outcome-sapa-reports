The leader of  South Africa ’s ruling
African National Congress youth arm,  Julius Malema , said he’ll
accept the outcome of a disciplinary hearing by the ANC, the
South African Press Association reported, citing Malema.  Malema faced possible expulsion from the ANC for ill-
discipline, the Johannesburg-based news agency said, adding he
was charged on Aug. 19.  Should the party’s disciplinary committee suspend him and
disband the youth league’s top structure, he would accept this,
SAPA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
