A U.K.  tax rate  of 50 percent on the
country’s highest earners should be kept in place to show the
wealthy are paying their fair share, Universities Minister David Willetts said, the Financial Times reported.  There’s symbolic importance to the tax bracket because it
shows struggling families the rich are contributing, Willetts
said, according to the FT. Chancellor  George Osborne  ordered an
investigation into how much the tax rate on those making 150,000
pounds ($245,520) or more actually raises, the FT said.  “It is very important that people see that when times are
tough, we are, as they say, all in it together,” Osborne said
in the FT article. “People see that there are higher rates of
tax being borne.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
