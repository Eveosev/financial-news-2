Germany ’s Christian Social Union
party, an affiliate of  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s Christian
Democrats, wants the country to uphold the European Union’s no-
bailout rule,  Focus  magazine reported.  The CSU has drawn up a position paper for an Aug. 29
meeting that will focus on revamping its strategy in the euro
debt crisis, said the magazine, citing the paper.  “Turning away from the precept of no-bailouts amounts to
turning away from the conditions on which the currency union
rests,” said Focus, citing the CSU paper directly. “That’s the
same as turning away from self-responsibility and national
sovereignty to create a transfer union.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
