German Foreign Minister  Guido Westerwelle  said the European Union should respond to the debt
crisis by fostering integration around a core even if this means
creating a union of “two speeds,” the  Die Welt  said.  In an interview published tomorrow, Westerwelle said all 27
EU states should be invited to speed up integration of economic
and budget policy as well as of defense policy. Those states who
are unable to participate “shouldn’t hold up the others,” he
is cited as saying by the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
