The  Philippines ’ monetary policy is
appropriate “for the moment” as it closely monitors how global
developments, including the  Federal Reserve ’s policy, impact
capital flows and commodity prices, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas
Governor Amando Tetangco said.  “Should the current environment shift, the BSP is ready to
make any necessary changes to ensure that inflation expectations
remain well-anchored and inflation is kept within target,”
Tetangco wrote in an e-mail today.  “The Fed’s view of the state of the  U.S. economy  is a
reminder that patience is required,” the Philippine governor
said. “It also reinforces the call from their counterparts that
policymakers in advanced economies urgently need comprehensive
reform of their fiscal processes to ensure that the intended
effect of accommodative monetary policy is sustained in the
long-term.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
