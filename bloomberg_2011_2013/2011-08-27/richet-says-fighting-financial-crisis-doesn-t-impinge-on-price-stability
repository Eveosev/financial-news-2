European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  said fighting the financial crisis doesn’t
undermine the ability of policy makers to ensure stable prices.  “Our non-standard measures do not in any way impinge upon
our capacity to design our monetary policy stance to deliver
price stability in the medium term,” Trichet said today at a
conference of central bankers in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming, today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
