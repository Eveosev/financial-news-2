Tokyo Electric Power Inc. asked a
government panel for permission to raise charges to consumers by
at least by 10 percent, the Yomiuri newspaper reported without
saying where it obtained the information. The utility wants
rates to reflect fuel costs of thermal  power plants , which might
otherwise affect its ability to pay compensation to victims of
the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant, Yomiuri said  The panel, which is investigating the utilityâ€™s finances,
thinks the scale of any rate increase should be lower because
the company, known as Tepco, can reduce costs by cutting jobs,
the report said.  Tepco said the report was inaccurate and that the utility 
isn't in a position to talk about rate increases, in a statement
published on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
