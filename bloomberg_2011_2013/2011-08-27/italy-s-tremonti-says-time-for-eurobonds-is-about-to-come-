Italian Finance Minister  Giulio Tremonti  renewed calls for eurobonds, or joint bond issuance by
euro-area nations, saying that their “time is about to come.”  “It’s an idea that’s going ahead,” Tremonti said today in
a speech at a conference in Rimini,  Italy . “Eurobonds have
sense both for emergency debt issuances and to finance future
growth prospects.”  Tremonti also said that the “game over” of the crisis
hasn’t been reached yet.  To contact the reporters on this story:
