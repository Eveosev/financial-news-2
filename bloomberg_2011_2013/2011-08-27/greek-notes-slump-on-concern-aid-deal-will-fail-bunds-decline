Greek two-year notes slumped,
pushing yields to a euro-era record of 45.91 percent this week,
on concern  Finland ’s demands for loan collateral will endanger
the nation’s second bailout package and trigger a default.  German 10-year bonds fell for the first week in five as
European equities posted a weekly gain, damping demand for the
relative safety of government debt. Italian 10-year bonds
completed their first weekly loss since the  European Central
Bank  began buying the securities to stem contagion from the
sovereign debt crisis. Italy, Spain and  France  are scheduled to
auction debt next week.  “With the demands for collateral deals in return for loans
to Greece, the risk of the rescue package not being realized has
increased quite significantly,” said Niels From, chief analyst
at Nordea Bank AB in Copenhagen. “The market is now doubting
that there will be a rescue package and Greek bonds have been
punished.”  Greece ’s two-year yields rose 6.17 percentage points to
43.94 percent as of 5:27 p.m. in London yesterday, that’s the
biggest ever weekly increase. Yields reached a euro-era record
on Aug 25. The nation’s 10-year bonds climbed 1.21 percentage
points to 17.86 percent. They reached 18.55 percent on Aug. 25,
also the highest since the euro was introduced in 1999.  Euro-area governments are “looking for a solution” to the
dispute over collateral for further aid to Greece,  Bertrand Benoit , a German Finance Ministry spokesman said yesterday.  Greek Aid  Greece is seeking a second aid package as its economic woes
stymied its intention to return to the capital markets in 2012.
 Austria  and the Netherlands -- which like Finland have AAA
credit ratings -- said they wanted a similar collateral deal in
return for providing more aid, as did Slovakia and Slovenia.  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield increased five basis points
this week to 2.16 percent, after climbing to a one-week high of
2.28 percent on Aug. 28. The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index
rose 1.1 percent over the five trading days.  Ten-year bund yields have still dropped 38 basis points
this month as investors sought the relative safety of government
debt as global equity markets plummeted on signs the  U.S.
economy  -- the world’s largest -- is faltering.  Italian 10-year bond yields gained 14 basis points this
week rising to 5.07 percent, while  Spain ’s 10-year yields
climbed four basis points to 5 percent.  ECB Buying  The ECB has bought  government bonds  in each of the past
three weeks in a bid to stave off contagion from Greece, Ireland
and Portugal and bring 10-year yields from Spain and Italy to
around 5 percent. Yields of both nations’ debt surged to euro-
era records at the start of this month.  Italy plans to sell 8 billion euros ($11.5 billion) of debt
maturing in 2014, 2018 and 2022 on Aug. 30. On Sept. 1, Spain
will auction bonds due in 2016 and France will offer securities
maturing in 2016, 2021 and 2041.  “After the summer break we are starting to see supply pick
up again,” Nordea’s From said. “It will be very interesting to
see how the auctions will be digested by the market.”  German government bonds have handed investors a gain of 5.5
percent this year through yesterday, according to indexes
compiled by the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies and Bloomberg. Greece’s have declined 23 percent,
Italy’s have gained 0.6 percent and Spain’s have increased 5.4
percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
