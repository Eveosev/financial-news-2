Peru’s Cabinet approved a draft for
the country’s 2012 budget that will increase spending by 5
percent, according to a presidential statement.  The bill sets the 2012 budget at 95.5 billion nuevos soles
($35 billion), according to an e-mailed statement. The bill
places education, health, security and “the fight against
corruption” as budget priorities, the statement said, citing
Economy minister Miguel Castilla.  The draft does not take into account a new mining windfall
tax, which the government expects may collect as much as 3
billion soles a year, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
