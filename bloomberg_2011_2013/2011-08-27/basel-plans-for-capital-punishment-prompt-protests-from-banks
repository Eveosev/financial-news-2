Global banks are launching a
counterattack against new capital guidelines, warning that they
could reduce lending and harm growth as well as alter
competition in the financial system.  The Clearing House Association and the Institute of
International Bankers, whose members include  JPMorgan Chase &
Co (JPM) ,  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ,  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) ,  Citigroup Inc. (C) ,
 Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and  ING Groep NV (INGA) , said in a letter that capital
surcharges agreed to by the  Federal Reserve  and international
regulators are “deeply flawed” and “reflexively based on the
notion that size alone creates prudential concerns.”  “There is a real tension between the regulators and the
largest global systemically important institutions,” said
Margaret Tahyar, a partner in the financial institutions
practice at law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell in New York.
“Capital is almost being used as a punishment.”  Bloomberg News obtained an Aug. 25 draft of the letter,
which will be filed as a comment on proposed capital surcharges
for big banks agreed on by the  Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision  in June. The Fed, which is part of the Basel
Committee, is also preparing to release its own proposals under
the Dodd-Frank Act for stricter standards for the largest U.S.
banks sometime in the next five weeks.  Tighter international and U.S. standards on capital,
liquidity and risk management are likely to alter competition in
the U.S., the banking groups said in their letter. The Basel
capital surcharge will “lead to unjustified competitive
inequities between large banks” subject to the charge and
others that aren’t, they said.  Mergers, Expansion  Tahyar agreed, saying the regulations will discourage
mergers and expansion by the largest institutions and open a
path for “a new pool of super-regional banks.”  Investors have fled from bank stocks this year as U.S.
economic growth slowed to an annual rate of 1 percent in the
second quarter. The onslaught of new regulations amid a
continuing slump in U.S. home prices has raised questions about
returns on bank equity over the longer term.  “The legislation, actions and decisions coming out of the
Congress and the administration over the last few years paint a
blurry and inconsistent picture of what the future of U.S.
financial services and housing finance will be,” said Thomas Vartanian, a partner at law firm Dechert LLP in  Washington .  The KBW Bank Index, which tracks 24 large U.S. banks, is
down 27 percent year-to-date versus a 6.4 percent decline for
the  Standard & Poor’s  500 index.  Global Banks  Regulators meeting in Basel in June said as many as 28
global banks will have to hold an additional 1 percentage point
to 2.5 percentage points of common equity capital as a buffer
against systemic risk. Banks’ risk will be scored on their size,
reach, market share and complexity.  There is an additional 1 percentage point surcharge on top
of the 2.5 percentage points to discourage the biggest banks
from merging or expanding their balance sheets.  Regulators are trying to avoid a repeat of the global
economic collapse that forced governments to provide hundreds of
billions of dollars in loans, guarantees and taxpayer-funded
bailouts to the financial system in 2008 and 2009.  In their letter to Basel regulators, banks said the capital
charges could result in reduced lending and job growth “at a
particularly difficult economic juncture.”  “Continual demands for banks to raise capital and
significant regulatory uncertainty have made banks cautious to
lend,” said Hugh Carney, senior counsel for the  American
Bankers Association , which is also preparing a comment letter.  ‘Reduced Credit Availability’  The Global Financial Markets Association, an international
group of financial trade associations whose members include
firms such as  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and Morgan Stanley, also
filed a comment letter yesterday warning that higher  capital
requirements  could result in “reduced credit availability.”  Still, regulators have shown little inclination to yield.
Fed Governor  Daniel Tarullo  said in a June 3 speech that
“smaller banks” could step into markets that big banks have to
leave because of higher capital requirements. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told the Senate Banking Committee in July that
shrinkage of some large banks would be one “sign of success”
that the regulations are curbing systemic risk.  “What is foremost in their minds is what are we going to
do next time if they all fail together?” said Viral Acharya, a
 New York  University economist and co-author of a book on the
Dodd-Frank Act. “There isn’t going to be an easy political
consensus on injecting capital into the banking sector.”  In their letter, the Clearing House Association and the
Institute of International Bankers challenged Tarullo’s claims
that smaller banks could fill the gap, citing a study conducted
for them by McKinsey & Co.  ‘Broad Scope’  “The broad scope of products and services provided by
large banks creates economic value from products that others
cannot provide at all,” the groups wrote in their letter.  Regulators also have pressure from members of Congress to
apply Dodd-Frank rules and curb bailouts. U.S. Representative
 Barney Frank , a Massachusetts Democrat, has asked the Fed to
extend its examination of  Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) ’s
acquisition of ING Direct USA, which he said would create the
fifth-largest  U.S. bank . The Fed announced yesterday that it
would hold three public hearings on the deal.  “Mergers will certainly be an issue,” James Wigand,
director of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.’s Office of
Complex Financial Institutions, said in an interview. “There
are inherent challenges in understanding the risks of very
complex, and in some cases, jurisdictionally dispersed
operations.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
