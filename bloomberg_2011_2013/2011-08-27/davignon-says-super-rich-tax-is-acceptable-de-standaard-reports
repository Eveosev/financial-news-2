Belgian billionaire and Suez board
member Etienne Davignon says higher tax rates for the “super
rich” are acceptable, he is cited in an interview with Belgian
newspaper  De Standaard .  The Belgian government has to take cost-saving measures
itself in the first place, De Standaard cited Davignon as
saying. Temporary higher tax rates are acceptable and needed to
get the budget back in balance before 2015, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
