Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc (RB/)  recalled
and halted manufacturing and distribution of the Nurofen Plus
painkiller after five cases in which boxes were found to have
been tampered with, Nurofen said in a statement.  The unit of Slough, England-based Reckitt suspects sabotage
in the finding of “other manufacturer’s medicines” inside the
packages, the e-mailed statement said. No serious health
consequences have been reported and no other Nurofen products
are affected, it added.  “We will not take any risk regarding the quality or safety
of our products,” the note said. “Sabotage is suspected and we
are working with the police on a formal investigation to find
the person or persons responsible.”  Blister strips containing the prescription antipsychotic
medicine Seroquel and Neurontin, which treats epilepsy, were
introduced in the Nurofen Plus cases, the statement said. Animal
rights activists may have conducted the swap, the Daily Mail
newspaper said yesterday, without saying how it obtained the
information.  “Nurofen Plus has a firm policy of not testing on
animals,” Aomesh Bhatt, medical director for Nurofen Plus, was
quoted as saying in an e-mail sent to Bloomberg News by the
medical firm’s press agency.  Consumers can return the product to pharmacists and obtain
a refund, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
