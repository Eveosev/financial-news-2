Christine Lagarde , the International
Monetary Fund’s new managing director, said policy makers need
to come up with “credible measures that are sustainable” to
cut deficits in the mid-to-long term without stifling a nascent
recovery.  “The debate currently is on the very delicate decision of
economic policy that consists on the one hand of cutting the
deficit and shrinking the debt while at the same time not
stifling growth,” she said in an interview from  Jackson Hole ,
Wyoming, with French television station TF1 last night.  Lagarde also called for greater coordination between global
regulators to prevent the kind of turmoil that roiled markets
this month.  “There’s a lot more that needs to be done to improve
coordination between regulators, notably in  Europe  but also in
the U.S., in Japan, and increasingly in emerging markets that
are playing a greater role in driving growth,” she said.  Separately, she said her predecessor, Dominique Strauss-
Kahn, has asked to see his former colleagues and members of his
staff, “just to say goodbye and have a reconciliation before
leaving the U.S.”  Strauss-Kahn, the former IMF chief who won dismissal of
sexual-assault charges in  New York , had his travel documents
returned to him by prosecutors this week. Strauss-Kahn was
accused of sexually assaulting a hotel maid. Charges were
dropped after prosecutors said she lied repeatedly to them and
others.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
