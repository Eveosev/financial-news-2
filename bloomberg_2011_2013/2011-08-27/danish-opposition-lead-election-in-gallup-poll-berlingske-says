Denmarkâ€™s opposition bloc led the
Liberal-Conservative government and its allies in a Gallup poll
published today by Copenhagen-based  Berlingske .  The opposition, led by Social Democrat Helle Thorning- Schmidt, has 51.6 percent voter backing, versus 48.2 support for
the ruling coalition, the poll showed.  Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen today called an early
election after failing to secure majority lawmaker backing for
his economic stimulus package. Danes go to the polls on Sept.
