Queens Park Rangers signed Aston
Villa defender Luke Young to a three-year contract, the Premier
League club said on its website.  Young, 32, becomes QPR’s second signing since  Tony
Fernandes  bought the club last week. Midfielder  Joey Barton 
joined from Newcastle yesterday on a four-year deal.  “There are big things that are going to happen at this
football club and I am really pleased to be a part of it,”
Young said on QPR’s website. “Myself and Joey signing here
shows the intent of the club.”  Young began his career at Tottenham, before spells at
Charlton, Middlesbrough and Villa. He’s also made seven
appearances for the England national team.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
