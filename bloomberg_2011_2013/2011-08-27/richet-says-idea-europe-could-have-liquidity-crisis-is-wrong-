European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  dismissed any idea that Europe could face a
liquidity shortage, saying efforts to combat the financial
crisis will prevent such an outcome.  “The idea that we could have a liquidity problem in
Europe” is “plain wrong because of these non-standard measures
we have taken,” Trichet said today at a conference of central
bankers in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming.  To contact the reporters on this story:
