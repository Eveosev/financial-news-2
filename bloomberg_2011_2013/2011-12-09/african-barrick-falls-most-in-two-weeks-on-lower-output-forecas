African Barrick Gold Plc, the largest
producer of the metal in Tanzania, dropped the most in two weeks
in  London  trading after saying fourth-quarter output will miss
earlier forecasts because of power outages.  African Barrick fell 2.1 percent to 509 pence, the biggest
decline since Nov. 23, by the close in London. It won’t achieve
an expected run-rate production in the fourth quarter after five
or six daily power outages at its Buzwagi plant in Tanzania, it
said in a statement today. “As a result we are likely to fall
just short of 700,000 ounces of gold production in 2011.”  The miner expects plant down time and extra maintenance
closings because of power problems to cut 35,000 to 40,000
ounces of gold output this year, it said in the statement.  The company commissioned 16 megawatts of back-up power
capacity last week on top of the 5 megawatt unit it built in
July at Buzwagi, according to the statement. The mine will
operate at full capacity in December, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
