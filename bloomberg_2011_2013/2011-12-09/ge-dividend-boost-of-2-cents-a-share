General Electric Co. (GE)  raised its
quarterly dividend to 17 cents a share from 15 cents, matching
analysts’ forecasts, as Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey Immelt 
increased the payout for the fourth time in two years.  The dividend is payable Jan. 25 to shareholders of record
on Dec. 27, GE said today in a statement. The shares rose 2.9
percent to $16.79 at 11:23 a.m. in  New York .  Analysts including JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s C.  Stephen Tusa ,
Citigroup Inc.’s Deane Dray and Bernstein & Co.’s Steven Winoker
have estimated in recent weeks a raise that would push the yield
over 4 percent from 3.62 percent, or about 17 cents. Bloomberg
analysts also projected an increase of 2 cents.  “Our financial performance continues to accelerate,”
Immelt said in the statement. “The GE business model will
continue to deliver strong earnings and cash flow growth going
forward.”  GE paid $3.3 billion in October to repurchase preferred
stock sold to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. as
financial markets froze in 2008. That stake carried a 10 percent
annual dividend, or about $300 million, and Immelt has said the
redemption should boost earnings by 3 cents a share next year.  The Fairfield, Connecticut-based company cut its
shareholder payout in February 2009 for the first time since the
Depression to conserve cash as the global recession and credit
crunch drained profit from its finance unit.  GE had $91 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of
the third quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
