A European Union summit  agreement  on
enforcing debt and deficit limits may herald the start of the
path toward joint euro-area debt, said a senior member of German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s Christian Democratic Union party.  “You can have more rules and more instruments for common
responsibility if you have bigger assurance that every part of
it plays by the rules,” Elmar Brok, a CDU lawmaker in the
European Parliament, said in an interview in Brussels today.
With the summit agreement, the euro area has “a legal framework
in which it can be discussed and enforced.”  Merkel and French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  rejected euro
bonds as recently as Dec. 5, yet have left the door open to
joint liability at the end of a process of “fiscal union.”
European Commission President  Jose Barroso  made a proposal last
month for common bond issuance once there’s “a greater level
of integration and discipline in the euro zone.”  While euro bonds were not discussed at the all-night
summit, Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  told
reporters after it ended today that he was “happy the subject of
euro bonds is not completely off the table.”  Any decision to issue joint debt won’t come unless policy
makers ensure that the region’s financially stronger countries
won’t face “much higher  interest rates ” and that the weaker
countries don’t ease up on fiscal discipline, Brok said.  “Euro bonds could not be done before we have these changes
in place,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
