Madagascar plans to restart extension
projects at its Ivato airport and Toamasina port as it returns
to political stability, l’Express de Madagascar reported, citing
an official it didn’t identify.  Works at the airport comprise extending the runway to 3.9
kilometers (2.4 miles) from 3.15 kilometers, accommodating
aircraft larger than Boeing’s 747, the Antananarivo-based
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
