Shares of the following companies had
 unusual (VNINDEX)  moves in Vietnam trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the 11 a.m. local-time close.  The VN Index, the benchmark measure of the Ho Chi Minh City
Stock Exchange, fell 1.2 percent to 377.16, the lowest since May
2009.  HAGL Joint-Stock Co. (HAG)  , Vietnam’s second-biggest
listed real-estate company by market value, fell 3.5 percent to
22,000 dong, the lowest since Nov. 15. Standard & Poor’s Ratings
Services lowered its long-term corporate credit rating on the
company to “B-” from “B.”  “The rating downgrade reflects our view that HAGL’s
operating performance and liquidity are likely to remain weak in
the next six to 12 months,” S&P wrote in a report yesterday.  Rubber Stocks:  Saovang Rubber Joint-Stock Co. (SRC)  ,
dropped 3.8 percent to 7,700 dong, a record low.  Southern Rubber
Industry Joint-Stock Co. (CSM)   fell 3.3 percent to 8,900
dong.  Hoa Binh Rubber Joint-Stock Co. (HRC)  (HRC) decreased 1.9
percent to 52,000 dong, the lowest since Oct. 21.  Rubber futures declined on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange,
paring a weekly advance, after the European Central Bank damped
speculation it would step up debt purchases, deepening concerns
that the crisis may worsen and a global recovery may stall.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
