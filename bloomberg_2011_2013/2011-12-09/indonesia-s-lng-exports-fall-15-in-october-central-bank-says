Indonesia ’s liquefied-natural-gas
exports fell by 15 percent in October from the month before,
according to data from the country’s central bank.  The country, the world’s second-largest exporter of the
fuel after Qatar, exported 83.9 million British thermal units in
October, down from 99.2 million Btu in September,  Bank Indonesia 
said on its website. Indonesia shipped 101 million Btu in
October 2010.  Oil exports fell 12 percent from September to 9.6 million
barrels in October, according to data from the central bank.
Indonesia exported 11.4 million barrels in October 2010.  Bank Indonesia didn’t provide an explanation for the fall
in LNG and crude exports. The country,  Southeast Asia ’s largest
oil producer, became a net oil importer after declining output
at aging fields led Indonesia to withdrawal from the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
