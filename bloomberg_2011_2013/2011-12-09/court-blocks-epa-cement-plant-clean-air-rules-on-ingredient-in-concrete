Environmental Protection Agency rules
controlling cement plants’ storage of a substance used in making
concrete were temporarily blocked by a federal appeals court.  The Portland Cement Association, an industry trade group,
in October argued before the Washington court that new emissions
standards are arbitrary and that their adoption violates the
federal  Clean Air Act .  A three-judge panel today agreed in part, issuing an order
blocking rules governing the storage of a cement ingredient
known as “clinker” pending further EPA review. While the
agency previously conceded it hadn’t given enough notice of the
new standards, it refused to delay enforcement, the court said.
Other rules were left in place by the judges.  “Because EPA will now be receiving comments for the first
time, the standards could likely change substantially,” the
panel said. “Thus, industry should not have to build expensive
new containment structures until the standard is finally
determined.”  The case is Portland Cement Association v. Environmental
Protection Agency, 10-1359, U.S. Court of Appeals, District of
Columbia Circuit ( Washington ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
