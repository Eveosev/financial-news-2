TengizChevroil LLP, the Kazakh oil
venture led by  Chevron Corp. (CVX) , said production “safely returned
to normal rates” yesterday evening after a fire at one of its
processing plants.  The liquefied petroleum gas treatment unit has been
isolated after the blaze, the Atyrau-based venture said today in
an e-mailed statement. The Complex Technology Line 1 at the
Tengiz oilfield is running without the unit, the venture said.  “Teams are concentrating on repairing the unit and the
investigative group has begun work to determine the cause of the
incident,” the company said.  TengizChevroil said yesterday the fire at the processing
plant will have a “minimal” effect on total production.  Chevron, based in  San Ramon ,  California , holds 50 percent
of TengizChevroil.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  has 25 percent,
Kazakhstan’s state-owned KazMunaiGaz National Co. owns 20
percent and Lukarco, owned by Russia’s OAO Lukoil, 5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
