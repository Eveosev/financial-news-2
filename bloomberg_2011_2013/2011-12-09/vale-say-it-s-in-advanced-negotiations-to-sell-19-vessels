Vale SA , the iron-ore producer
building a fleet of the world’s largest commodities ships,
confirmed it’s in advanced talks to sell 19 of the vessels after
the plan spurred opposition from Chinese ship owners.  Rio de Janeiro-based Vale Chief Executive Officer Murilo Ferreira has said he is willing to sell the ships only if the
company can lease them back under long-term contracts, according
to a Vale official who declined to be named, citing internal
policy. The talks were reported earlier by the O Globo
newspaper, which cited an interview with Ferreira.  Vale is spending at least $8.1 billion on the so-called
valemax vessels, including buying 19 very large ore carriers and
leasing another 16 in long-term contracts, as at seeks to lower
freight costs from Brazil to China, its biggest market. The
China Shipowners Association, whose members control about 80
percent of the nation’s shipping capacity, advised companies not
use the vessels, according to Executive Vice Chairman Zhang
Shouguo. None of the six vessels already in operation since
April have called at Chinese ports.  Vale  gained (VALE5)  1.1 percent to 38.92 reais in  Sao Paulo  at 2:48
p.m. The stock has declined about 20 percent during 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
