Oil options volatility fell as
underlying futures rose the most in a week after a report showed
higher confidence among U.S. consumers.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
January, a measure of expected swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, declined to 35.28 at 4:30 p.m. in New York from
36.42 yesterday. Futures gained 1.1 percent after the Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of consumer
sentiment increased to 67.7 in December from 64.1 last month.  The most active options contracts in electronic trading
today were January $90 puts, with 2,484 lots changing hands as
of 4:52 p.m. in New York. The options fell 12 cents to 10 cents
a barrel. January $95 puts traded 1,594 lots, dropping 46 cents
to 36 cents. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  Oil for January delivery rose $1.07 to settle at $99.41 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . It was the biggest
gain since Nov. 29.  January $90 puts were the most active options traded in the
previous session, with 8,358 lots changing hands. They rose 13
cents to 22 cents a barrel. The next-most active options,
February $135 calls, declined 2 cents to 18 cents on volume of
5,370 contracts.  Open interest was highest for December 2012 $150 calls with
38,023 contracts. Next were December 2012 $80 puts with 35,454
contracts and December 2012 $100 calls with 32,464.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
