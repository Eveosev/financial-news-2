China  will raise taxes for larger
commercial vessels arriving from overseas as it restructures
tariffs to reflect increasing vessel sizes.  Ships bigger than 50,000 tons will have to pay 5.3 yuan per
ton beginning Jan. 1, the State Council said in a  statement 
posted on its website today. The cost will increase if the levy
is paid later than 30 days.  The previous top rate was 4.65 yuan for ships larger than
10,000 tons, according to a national  policy statement  posted on
Guangdong Maritime Safety Administrationâ€™s website. The tax
mechanism was first published in 1952 and amended in 1994, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
