Egypt ’s natural-gas exports to Jordan
will resume within days following repairs to a pipeline network
damaged by a Nov. 28 blast, the Jordan Times said, citing Faruq
Hiyari, secretary-general of Jordan’s energy ministry, and
officials at Egyptian Natural Gas Co.  The explosion in Egypt’s Sinai, the third in less than a
month and the ninth this year, inflicted losses of 3 million
dinars ($4.2 million) a day on Jordan, which had to run its
 power plants  on more expensive heavy fuel oil and diesel, the
newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
