A tax-collection official was wounded
by a letter-bomb in  Rome  a day after an Italian anarchist group
said it targeted  Deutsche Bank AG  Chief Executive Officer Josef Ackerman with a similar device.  Marco Cuccagna, an official with Italian tax-collection
agency Equitalia, was hurt in the attack today, according to an
e-mailed statement in which Prime Minister  Mario Monti  expressed
“solidarity” with the victim. Cuccanga suffered injuries to a
hand and his face in the blast, news agency Ansa reported.  No one has claimed responsibility for today’s incident,
though investigators are looking into possible links with the
German case, Ansa newswire reported, citing sources close to the
investigation.  The explosive device sent to Ackermann was claimed by FAI,
an Italian anarchist group which has undertaken several attacks
in recent years including a 2003 letter bomb to the  European
Central Bank , Frankfurt prosecutors and state police said in a
joint statement yesterday. They also said before today’s attack
that another two letter bombs may have been sent by the group.  Banks and other financial or government institutions have
drawn anger from Wall Street to London, Frankfurt and Rome as
demonstrators take to the streets to protest lender bailouts and
austerity measures caused by the debt crisis. Monti recently
announced 30 billion euros ($40 billion) in emergency measures
aimed at reducing  Italy ’s debt which include higher taxes, an
increase in the  retirement age  and a temporary halt to inflation
indexation on some pensions.  Monti praised the work of Equitalia in today’s statement,
saying it carries out “an essential function” without which
“it wouldn’t be possible to offer services to citizens and
their families.”  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
