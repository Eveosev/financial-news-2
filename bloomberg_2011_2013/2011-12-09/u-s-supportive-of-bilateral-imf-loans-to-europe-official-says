The U.S. supports other nations
making bilateral loans to the  International Monetary Fund  for
 Europe  even though it won’t contribute, an Obama administration
official said.  The IMF can’t substitute for a European show of force and
commitment to the 17-nation euro area, said the official, who
declined to be identified as a condition for holding a briefing
with reporters today. Europe is still working toward building a
so-called firewall, the official said.  European leaders holding all-night talks in Brussels added
200 billion euros ($267 billion) to their crisis-fighting fund
and tightened anti-deficit rules. They sped up the start of a
500 billion-euro rescue fund to next year and diluted a demand
that bondholders shoulder losses in rescues.  While European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  hailed
the accord, investors urged him to expand his crisis-fighting
arsenal to ensure debt-addled nations can pay their bills.
Italian and Spanish bonds fell even as the ECB was said to be
buying them in the market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
