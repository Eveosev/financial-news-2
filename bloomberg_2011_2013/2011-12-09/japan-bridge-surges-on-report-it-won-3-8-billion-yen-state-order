Japan Bridge Corp. (5912)  surged in Tokyo
trading after the Nikkan Kogyo newspaper said the builder won a
3.8 billion yen ($49 million) contract from the government.  Japan Bridge jumped 15 percent, the most since May 31, to
250 yen as of 10:24 a.m. in Tokyo. The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)

bridge in Saitama Prefecture, near Tokyo, Nikkan Kogyo said,
without saying where it got the information. The Bridge is
expected to be completed by spring 2013, it said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
