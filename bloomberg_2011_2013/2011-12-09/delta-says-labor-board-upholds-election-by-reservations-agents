Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  said the
 National Mediation Board  rejected interference claims by the
Machinists union in a November 2010 election among 15,000
reservations and ticket agents.  The move allows the carrier to begin aligning work rules
and pay for employees in the group, according to an e-mailed
statement today.  The case was the last unresolved election for union
representation triggered by Atlanta-based Deltaâ€™s purchase of
Northwest Airlines Corp. in 2008. Most Delta employees were non-
union, while their counterparts at Northwest were mostly
unionized.  To contact the reporter on this story:
