Turkey ’s  economic growth  is expected
to slow in the third quarter as inflation accelerated, the lira
weakened and the crisis in Europe pared an expansion in exports.  Growth is expected to decline to 5.9 percent annually from
8.8 percent in the three months to June, according to the median
estimate of four analysts in a survey compiled by Bloomberg.
Forecasts ranged from 4.1 percent to 7.3 percent.  “This will be the last strong year-on-year figure and
starting in the fourth quarter there will be a noticeable
slowdown in growth that will become more visible, particularly
in consumption and investment,”  Tevfik Aksoy , chief economist
for the region at Morgan Stanley in  London , said in an e-mailed
report today.  The statistics office in Ankara is due to publish the
growth data at 10 a.m. on Dec. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
