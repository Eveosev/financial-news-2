Japanese regulators will approve a
plan by  Nippon Steel Corp. (5401)  and  Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd. (5405)  to
combine and create the world’s second-largest steelmaker by
October next year, the Asahi newspaper reported.  The Japan Fair Trade Commission will announce the approval
of the planned merger by the end of this month, the newspaper
said, without disclosing where it obtained the information.  The commission may ask the steelmakers to resolve a
competition problem for steel sheet pile because the combined
market share exceeded 70 percent in the financial year ended in
March 2010, the report said. The companies may sell or dispose
of production facilities for the steel product.  Officials at the commission couldn’t be reached for comment
when contacted by Bloomberg. Nippon Steel hasn’t heard anything
about the FTC’s review of the merger, spokesman Hiroshi Nakashima said today by telephone. Sumitomo Metal spokesman Akio
Yokoyama said the company is not in a position to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
