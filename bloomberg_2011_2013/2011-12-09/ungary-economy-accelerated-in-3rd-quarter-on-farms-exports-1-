Hungary ’s economic growth accelerated
in the third quarter as farm output and industrial exports
increased.  Gross domestic product rose 0.5 percent from the previous
three months, when growth was 0.2 percent, the statistics office
in Budapest said at a news conference today. The economy
expanded 1.4 percent from a year earlier after 1.5 percent in
the second quarter.  “Growth was mainly due to agricultural production and
industrial exports,” the statistics office said in its report.  The government will probably have to “strongly” reduce
its outlook for growth in 2012 because of European banks pulling
capital out of Hungary and a slowing German economy, Prime
Minister  Viktor Orban  said in an interview with French daily  Les
Echos  today.  The Cabinet based its 2012 draft budget on a growth
forecast of 1.5 percent. Expansion may be between 0.5 percent
and 1 percent, Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  said last month.  Agricultural output rose 28.5 percent in the third quarter
from a year earlier, while exports rose 7.6 percent, the
statistics office said. Construction output plunged 14.3
percent. Household spending rose 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
