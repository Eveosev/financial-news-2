U.S. video-game industry sales rose
0.4 percent to $3 billion last month, as gains in software
helped make up for declines in consoles and accessories.  Software revenue in November increased 15 percent from a
year earlier to $1.67 billion, researcher NPD Group Inc. said
today in an e-mailed statement. Hardware sales fell 9 percent
$982.4 million, while accessories dropped 34 percent to $273.8
million.  Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI) ’s “Call of Duty: Modern Warfare
3,” Bethesda Softwork’s “Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim” and
 Electronic Arts Inc. (ERTS) ’s “Battlefield 3” took the top three
sales spots, in a month crowded with titles released to meet
holiday shopping. Industry sales rose 2.5 percent in October.  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  led console sales in November with its Xbox
360.  “The gap between 360 sales and sales of the next best
selling platform was the largest we’ve seen since December 2008
when the Nintendo DS was the top selling system,”  Anita Frazier , an NPD analyst, said in a statement.  Microsoft has said U.S. Xbox sales totaled more than
960,000 for the Black Friday weekend. The Redmond, Washington-
based company also sold more than 750,000 Kinect sensors, both
standalone and bundled with  Xbox 360 .  Nintendo Co. sold more than 860,000 Wii home consoles in
November, more than 795,000 Nintendo 3DS portable units and more
than 350,000 Nintendo DS handhelds, the Kyoto, Japan-based
company said in a statement today, citing NPD figures.  “Both Nintendo 3DS and Wii have already set records, and
we’ve still got the bulk of the shopping season to go,” said
Scott Moffitt, Nintendo of America’s executive vice president of
sales and marketing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
