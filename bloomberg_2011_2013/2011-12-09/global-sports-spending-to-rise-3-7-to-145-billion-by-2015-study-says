Global spending on sports will
increase by an average of 3.7 percent a year to $145 billion by
2015, boosted by the Olympics and soccer’s World Cup, according
to a study by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.  Spending on the sports market will drop 2.2 percent to
$118.7 billion this year, a decrease PwC in part attributes to
growth last year, when the World Cup in  South Africa  helped
broaden the market by 7.9 percent.  The North American region, which accounts for about 41
percent of total global revenue, will see an average annual rise
of 4 percent by 2015, outperformed by the smaller Latin American
market, where PwC sees 4.9 percent growth. While ticket sales
will have an annual average growth of 2.5 percent in the period,
increases in media rights and sponsorships will help boost the
industry, PwC said.  “The cake is growing,” the authors, including Julie Clark
in the accounting and advisory firm’s London office, said. “The
real competition is around who can deliver the most entertaining
and compelling offerings that will claim the biggest slices.”  In the developing countries of  Brazil ,  Russia ,  India  and
 China , where sports spending increased an annual 7.7 percent
between 2006 and 2010, growth will slow in the next five years,
PwC said. The so-called BRIC countries will average 4.5 percent
through 2015.  Ticket sales make up about a third of total sports revenue
and will reach $44.7 billion by 2015, PwC said. Organizers are
trying to blend sports and entertainment to bring more people to
their stadiums, the authors said.  Sponsorship Growth  Spending on sponsorships will rise on average 5.3 percent
per year to $45.3 billion, PwC said. In North America that
growth should be 6.1 percent, while the European market will
increase 5.3 percent,  Latin America  by 4.9 percent and  Asia  by
4.4 percent, the authors state.  This category fell 3.2 percent in 2009 and then increased
more than 11 percent last year, PWC said. Growth is expected to
be limited to 0.5 percent this year and will jump to 11.5
percent in 2012.  “The industry’s fastest-growing source of money, sponsors
have continued to be attracted to sport throughout the downturn,
with a modest decline in 2009 followed by a double-digit
increase in 2010,” PwC said in the report.  Sporting events get about 24 percent of income from the
sale of media rights, an area that will increase by 3.8 percent
annually until 2015, PwC estimates. The area is volatile, with a
19 percent increase in 2010 followed by a decline of 7.8 percent
in the current year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
