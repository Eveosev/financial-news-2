The recent weakening of the Czech
koruna may have been the result of the market’s “perception”
of the country’s trade links with the euro-area, central bank
Governor Miroslav Singer said.  “I assume it may have been driven by the perception of our
our trade relations with the euro area, with the euro area being
our main trade partner,” Singer told the Senate when asked
about koruna weakening. He didn’t refer to any specific koruna
level.  To contact the reporter on this story:
