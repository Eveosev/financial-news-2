Johan Murod, general secretary at the
 Indonesia  Tin Association, quit the producers’ group after some
members violated an agreement to suspend exports.  “We all had committed that we will uphold the ban until
the yearend, but the reality is different,” Murod said in a
text message today. “PT Koba Tin broke the ban, followed by
other smelters. This is a violation of our agreement.”  About 30 tin producers in Indonesia’s Bangka Belitung
islands, which account for about 40 percent of global exports,
banned shipments from Oct. 1 to try and boost prices to $25,000
a metric ton. Tin has declined 25 percent this year on concern
that the Europe sovereign-debt crisis will hurt demand.  Suryadi, Koba Tin spokesman, declined to comment when
called on his cellphone in Jakarta.  To contact the reporter on this story:
