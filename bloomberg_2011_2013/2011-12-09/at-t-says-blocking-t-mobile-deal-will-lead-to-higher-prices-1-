AT&T Inc. (T)  Chief Executive Officer
Randall Stephenson said the blocking of the company’s proposed
$39 billion purchase of T-Mobile USA Inc. by regulators will
lead to higher prices for consumers.  Without T-Mobile, AT&T’s capacity is constrained,
Stephenson said last night at an event in  New York . Congress has
an ill-formed regulatory policy when it comes to wireless
carriers, he said.  “Regulators can’t keep up with the changes in the
industry,” Stephenson said at a Captains of Industry interview
series with Bloomberg News Chief Content Officer  Norman Pearlstine  at the 92nd Street Y in New York.  The Federal Communications Commission said in a report last
month that AT&T had failed to demonstrate the public benefits of
the deal, that the purchase of T-Mobile would cause significant
job losses and that AT&T would probably build high-speed
wireless Internet connections without the merger.  The FCC let Dallas-based AT&T withdraw its application to
buy T-Mobile, a deal that would combine the second- and fourth-
largest U.S. wireless carriers. The  Justice Department  sued in
August to block the merger as anti-competitive, and a court date
is set for February.  The application withdrawal leaves open the possibility that
AT&T may again approach the commission with a revised deal, FCC
officials have said. Before the report, analysts had said that
to gain approval, AT&T might have to give up half of T-Mobile’s
customers to ease antitrust concerns and gain control of assets
including wireless spectrum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
