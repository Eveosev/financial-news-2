Peter Sundman, chief executive
officer of ClearBridge Advisors, has been replaced by Terrence Murphy as  Legg Mason (LM)  Inc.’s biggest equity affiliate merged the
roles of president and CEO.  Murphy, who most recently was president of ClearBridge, has
been at the firm or its predecessor since 2000, the New York-
based unit of Legg Mason wrote in a Dec. 1 letter to clients.
Sundman joined ClearBridge about three years ago from Neuberger
Berman Group LLC, where he led the fund unit.  ClearBridge was formed in 2005 after Legg Mason bought
Citigroup Inc.’s money-management unit. ClearBridge, whose
investments are led by Chief Investment Officer Hersh Cohen,
managed about $48 billion assets as of Sept. 30.  Sundman has left the company, according to the client
letter, while Murphy “will focus his talents on growing the
firm by expanding our sales teams and developing products to
meet client needs.”  Legg Mason, based in Baltimore, manages about $629 billion
in assets. The company has $159.4 billion in equity assets
through affiliates such as ClearBridge, Legg Mason Capital
Management and Royce & Associates. About three-fourths of Legg
Mason’s assets are in fixed-income and money funds managed by
Western Asset Management.  To contact the reporter on this story:
