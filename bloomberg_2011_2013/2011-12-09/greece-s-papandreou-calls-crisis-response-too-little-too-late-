Former Prime Minister  George Papandreou  said the European Union has done “too little too
late” to solve the sovereign-debt crisis.  “We need a European, even global solution to this issue,”
Papandreou said today in Durban, South Africa. “We lost quite a
bit of time in  Europe  finger-pointing. We have done too little
too late,” he said.  “I do hope what we come up with in Brussels today is
encouraging and will keep the markets calm,” Papandreou said.  Responding to a question about the  European Central Bank ’s
role in fighting the debt crisis, Papandreou said Europe is
using “too few” of the instruments available to fight the debt
turmoil.  “Europe has lots of tools. We have been using too few of
them and too late,” Papandreou said. “What happens is they get
spent, psychologically, and the market doesn’t trust we have the
will. What we have to show the markets is they can trust the
euro.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
