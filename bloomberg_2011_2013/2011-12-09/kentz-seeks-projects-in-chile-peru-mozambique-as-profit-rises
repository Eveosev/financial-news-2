Kentz Corp., an Irish-based oil and
gas engineering company, is seeking businesses in new regions on
expectations of a 10 percent increase in profit next year.  Kentz is looking to expand in Canadian  oil sands  and is
examining plans to enter new regions such as Mozambique, Chile
and Peru, Chief Executive Officer Hugh O’Donnell said.  “We have a lot of bidding activity right now for projects
in Australia” as well as Iraq, Russia, Canada and Qatar,
O’Donnell said in an interview in Doha, Qatar. “Africa has
become our biggest region, because we’ve seen growth in some
 emerging markets  in Mozambique and Madagascar.”  Kentz had an order backlog of about $2.38 billion as of
Oct. 31 and is pursuing almost $10 billion of potential
contracts, O’Donnell said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
