Estonian residence permit
applications by Russian nationals have risen sharply this year
after  Estonia  scrapped a requirement for starting capital upon
the registration of a company,  Postimees  reported, citing
officials at the Ministry of the Interior.  Applications rose to 4,649 in the first six months of this
year, compared with 3,885 for the whole last year, as Russians
apply for permits by joining the management board of an
Estonian-registered company, the Tallinn-based newspaper
reported. The majority of those receiving permits have not been
registered as visiting Estonia, raising the ministryâ€™s concern
the permit is just used for free travel elsewhere in the
European Union, the newspaper said.  Until January, establishing a company required starting
capital equivalent to 2,557 euros ($3,410). The ministry plans
to amend the legislation to require proof of actual business
activity in Estonia before managers can apply for residence
permits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
