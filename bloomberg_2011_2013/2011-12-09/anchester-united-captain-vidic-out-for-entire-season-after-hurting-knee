Manchester United captain Nemanja Vidic will miss the rest of the season with a knee injury,
manager  Alex Ferguson  said.  Vidic was hurt in the first half of United’s 2-1 Champions
League loss at Basel two nights ago and the defender’s agent
said yesterday he’d ruptured a cruciate ligament, United said on
its  website .  “We thought it was a bad one,” Ferguson said. “He’s out
for the season. It’s not unexpected but it’s still bad news.”  Vidic will see a specialist next week to determine when to
have surgery, Ferguson said, adding that Jonny Evans,  Phil Jones 
and Chris Smalling are candidates to fill the void in central
defense.  United was eliminated from the Champions League with the
loss in Basel and will now play in the second-tier Europa
League.  The Red Devils host Wolverhampton in the Premier League
tomorrow. United is second in the league, five points behind
rival  Manchester City , which visits Chelsea in three days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
