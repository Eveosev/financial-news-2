Japanese  stocks  fell, sending the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average to its biggest drop in two weeks, after
the  European Central Bank  damped speculation it would step up
debt purchases.  Sony Corp. (6758) , a consumer electronics maker which depends on
Europe for about 20 percent of its sales, lost 3.3 percent.
 Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) ,  Japan ’s No. 3 lender by market
value, slid 1.9 percent.  Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd.  dropped 5.4
percent after Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. cut
the shipping line’s target price.  “The ECB outcome means the European issues won’t be solved
easily,” said Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at Tokyo-based
Nomura Holdings Inc. “The best scenario that the market had
expected was for the ECB to decide to expand purchases of
 government bonds  and then for the European Union to strengthen
finance regulations” at a summit being held in Brussels.  The Nikkei 225 fell 1.5 percent to 8,536.46 at the 3 p.m.
close in  Tokyo , its biggest drop since Nov. 24. The broader
Topix Index lost 0.9 percent to 738.12. The Topix had a weekly
decline of 0.8 percent.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 2.1 percent in  New
York  yesterday, snapping a three-day rally, after the ECB
disappointed expectations it would expand its 207 billion-euro
($276 billion) bond-buying program.  Draghi ‘Surprised’  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi , speaking
after the bank announced an interest rate cut, said he was
“surprised” that markets interpreted earlier comments as
hinting at big bond buys. He said a euro-zone “fiscal compact”
is the “most important precondition” for normalizing markets
and “the responsibility is with the leaders.”  Later in Brussels,  Europe  leaders laid out a new fiscal
plan to prevent future debt runups, accelerated the startup of a
planned 500 billion-euro rescue fund and scaled back bondholder
loss-sharing provisions.  Exporters to the region fell, with Sony declining 3.3
percent to 1,405 yen.  Kyocera Corp. , another electronics maker
that gets almost 20 percent of its sales in Europe, lost 2.5
percent to 6,630 yen.  Japan GDP  Stocks (TPX)  also fell today after Japan’s economy grew less than
the government initially estimated.  Gross domestic product 
expanded at an annualized 5.6 percent pace last quarter, the
Cabinet Office said today in Tokyo, compared with a preliminary
figure of 6 percent. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had
estimated a 5.2 percent rise.  Banks, insurers and brokerages declined.  Mizuho  fell 1.9
percent to 104 yen. Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co. sank 3.2 percent
to 82,000 yen. Daiwa Securities Group Inc. slipped 3.4 percent
to 255 yen.  The  Topix  has tumbled 18 percent this year amid concern
U.S. growth is sputtering and Europe’s debt crisis will damage
the banking system, damping demand in two of Japan’s biggest
export markets. The decline has cut the price of shares on the
index to 0.9 times book value, near the lowest since March 2009.  Kawasaki Kisen dropped the most in the  Nikkei 225 (NKY) , falling
5.4 percent to 139 yen, after Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley cut
the shipping line’s stock price estimate to 180 yen from 200 yen,
citing falling cargo rates on European routes.  Developers Retreat  Developers also declined after Miki Shoji Co., a privately
held office broker, yesterday said the vacancy rate for Tokyo
office space rose to 8.9 percent in November from 8.78 percent
the month before.  Mitsui Fudosan sank 3.6 percent to 1,192 yen. Mitsubishi
Estate Co. declined 3.4 percent to 1,275 yen. Sumitomo Realty &
Development Co. slid 3.8 percent to 1,469 yen.  Stocks tied to China also fell on a report mainland
industrial production rose 12.4 percent from a year earlier, its
slowest pace since August 2009.  TDK Corp. , a manufacturer of electronic parts that gets
almost a third of its revenue from  China , fell 1.7 percent to
3,540 yen. Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., which makes
excavators and other heavy equipment, slipped 1.9 percent to
1,374 yen.  -- Editors: Jason Clenfield, Jim Powell.  To contact the reporters on this story:
