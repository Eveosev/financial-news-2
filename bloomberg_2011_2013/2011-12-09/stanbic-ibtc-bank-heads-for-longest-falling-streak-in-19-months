Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc (IBTCCB)  headed for the
longest declining streak in more than 19 months as foreign
investors exited the Nigerian equities market over the debt
crisis in  Europe , Kundila Finance said.  The stock of the Nigerian unit of  Standard Bank Group Ltd. 
dropped for a seventh day, the longest retreat since April 2010,
falling 4 percent, to 6.30 naira as of 12:25 p.m. in Lagos. A
close at this price will be the lowest since September 2009.  “The problem we have now is that volume is foreign-driven
and some of them are selling to balance their books at home,”
Raheem Mohammed, chief operating officer of Lagos-based
brokerage Kundila Finance, said by phone today. “If they are
not buying what do you think will happen?”  European leaders are continuing their meeting today from
yesterday in Brussels for talks to frame the fifth
“comprehensive” solution in 19 months to a debt crisis that’s
left Germany and France facing the threat of losing their AAA
rating from  Standard & Poor’s .  IBTC shares have lost 32 percent of their value this year,
compared with a 22 percent decline in the Nigerian Stock
Exchange  All-Share Index (NGSEINDX)  over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
