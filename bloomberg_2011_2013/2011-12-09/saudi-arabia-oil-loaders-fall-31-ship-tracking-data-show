Oil tankers able to haul a combined
6.1 million barrels a day of crude went to  Saudi Arabia ’s Ras
Tanura, the world’s largest crude-export terminal, ship-tracking
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Vessels with a total capacity of 5.8 million deadweight
tons were at Ras Tanura from Nov. 27 to Dec. 3, 31 percent less
than the previous seven-day period, the data show. The figure
was multiplied by 7.33 and then divided by seven to estimate a
barrels-a-day equivalent.  China will get the largest share of shipments, with four
loadings during the period. Very large crude carriers with a
combined capacity of 1.23 million tons, or 9.05 million barrels,
are heading for the country after loading at the terminal. Three
cargoes are bound for  India .  Following are the ships that loaded at  Ras Tanura , the
companies that hired them and estimated times of arrival, where
data are available. Drafts are expressed as a percentage of
maximum sailing depth and are an indication of cargo size.  To contact the reporter on this story:
