The  European Investment Bank  may have
already started sales of the first 2013 carbon permits, boosting
supply as prices trade near record-low levels, said an analyst
at Orbeo.  “The EIB could have started already, I wouldn’t be
surprised,” said  Emmanuel Fages , an analyst in Paris at Orbeo,
an emissions trading venture. “This is the only window to
achieve their mandate.” He said he had no direct knowledge that
sales had started.  Solvay SA (SOLB)  is buying the 50 percent of Orbeo
it doesn’t already own from Societe Generale SA.  The European Union’s regulatory arm last week said it has
transferred carbon permits from a 2.3 billion-euro ($3.1
billion) reserve to the EIB, saying that sales of the allowances
may last until the end of 2013.  The 27-nation EU decided in 2008 to use proceeds from the
sale of 300 million post-2012 permits from the reserve for new
entrants to the bloc’s cap-and-trade program to encourage
renewable energy and carbon capture technologies. The first
tranche of 200 million permits has to be sold by Oct. 2, 2012,
and the remaining allowances may be sold later than the
originally planned end-2012 deadline, according to the EU.  December 2013 volumes jumped to 16 percent of the market on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London  this week from 9
percent last week, said Matthew Cowie, an analyst in London for
Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The 2013 premium over 2012 has
narrowed this week, he said.  ‘Not Violent’  Those two changes in combination with the EIB’s need to
start selling within a month of the transfer of allowances from
the commission, “could indicate that they’ve started selling,”
Cowie said today by phone. “If the NER300 sale has indeed
started and the market has not reacted violently then peoples’
fears that the world would end may prove unfounded.”  Given the deadline of starting sales by early January, the
EIB is “not going to want to start the week before Christmas,”
Cowie said. “In fact, it’s likely that the euro summit today is
a bigger concern for traders than the arrival of this volume at
the moment.”  EU December allowances dropped 0.9 percent to 7.57 euros a
ton as of 12:51 p.m. in London on ICE, the biggest exchange for
carbon trading. They earlier today rose as much as 1.4 percent.
They reached a record intraday low of 6.77 euros on Dec. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
