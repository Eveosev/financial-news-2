OMV Petrom SA (SNP) ,  Romania ’s largest oil
company, is seeking offers from companies interested in a
production-enhancement contract estimated at 1.05 billion lei
($323 million) for 13 fields located in the country’s west.  Petrom is waiting for offers until Jan. 20 for onshore oil
and natural-gas extraction services in 13 fields in the western
county of Timis, the Bucharest-based company said in an
 announcement  published on Dec. 7 on the country’s public
auctioning website.  “The main objectives of the contract which OMV Petrom will
award through a negotiation process are oil and natural-gas
production-enhancement services during the first five years of
the 13 fields’ operating period,” the company said in the
announcement.  Petrom is trying to boost productivity of its Romanian
fields by partnering companies that have the technology to
improve oil recovery rates as it seeks to mitigate a natural
decline in oil and gas production from its mature fields.  It has so far awarded a 15-year production contract to
U.K.-based Petrofac Ltd., an oilfield services and engineering
provider, last July and a 17-year contract to PetroSantander
Inc. for nine facilities in October.  Petrom’s production declined 1.6 percent in the third
quarter to 184,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day from 187,000
barrels in the previous three months, according to a statement
from its majority-owner  OMV AG (OMV)  on Oct. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
