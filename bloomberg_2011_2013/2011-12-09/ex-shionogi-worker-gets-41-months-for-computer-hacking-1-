A former information technology
worker at the U.S. unit of  Shionogi & Co. (4507) , a Japanese drugmaker,
was sentenced to 41 months in prison for hacking into the
company computer network and deleting parts of it, court records
show.  Jason Cornish, 37, also must pay $812,567 in restitution to
Shionogi Inc. in  Florham Park ,  New Jersey , U.S. District Judge
Stanley Chesler ordered. Cornish pleaded guilty in August in
federal court in  Newark , New Jersey, to carrying out the attack
on Feb. 3, 2011.  Cornish resigned from Shionogi in September 2010 after the
company announced job cuts that would affect a close friend who
was a former supervisor, according to a statement by U.S.
Attorney Paul Fishman.  In the attack, he accessed the computer system, took
control of a piece of software he had secretly installed weeks
earlier, and deleted the contents of 15 “virtual hosts” that
house the equivalent of 88 computer servers, Fishman said.  The deleted servers housed most of Shionogi’s American
computer infrastructure, and the attack “effectively froze
Shionogi’s operations for a number of days, leaving company
employees unable to ship product, cut checks or communicate by
e-mail,” according to the statement.  Cornish started the attack from a computer connected to the
wireless network of a McDonald’s Corp. restaurant in his
hometown of Smyrna,  Georgia , Fishman said.  Cornish attorney Richard Merritt didn’t immediately return
a call seeking comment.  The case is USA v. Cornish, 11-cr-546, U.S. District Court,
District of New Jersey (Newark).  To contact the reporter on this story:
