Denman, winner of the Cheltenham Gold
Cup in 2008, has been retired because of a leg injury, trainer
Paul Nicholls said.  The 11-year-old horse was injured this week training for
the Lexus Chase in Dublin on Dec. 28 and a scan yesterday
revealed a tiny tear in his near fore tendon.  “We immediately informed his owner Paul Barber, who after
consulting those close to him, took the decision to retire
him,”  Nicholls wrote  in his column on the Betfair gambling
website. “It was the only course of action to take.”  Denman beat stable mate and race favorite Kauto Star by
seven lengths to win the Gold Cup. Kauto Star returned the favor
in 2009 and Denman finished second to Imperial Commander and
Long Run the past two years.  Denman won 14 of 24 career races, with six other top-three
finishes. His last victory came in the 2009 Hennessy Chase, with
his last race a fifth-place finish in the Bowl Chase at Aintree
in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
