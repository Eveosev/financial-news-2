Greece  and  Russia  will discuss in
Athens next week Bulgaria’s plans to pull out of a 2007
agreement to build an oil pipeline bypassing Turkey’s crowded
Bosporus and Dardanelles straits.  The Greek-Russian Energy Committee will meet on Dec. 12 to
discuss how to handle the latest developments, according to an
e-mailed statement from the Athens-based Environment, Energy and
Climate Change ministry today.  Bulgaria will propose dissolving the trilateral agreement
for a proposed 285-kilometer (177-mile) pipeline from the
Bulgarian Black Sea port of Burgas to the Greek port of
Alexandroupolis on the Aegean or will withdraw unilaterally in
12 months, Energy and Economy Minister Traicho Traikov told
reporters in Sofia earlier this week.  The “strong and permanent commitment” of the Greek and
Russian governments was reaffirmed at a meeting in  Athens  today
between Greece’s Deputy Energy Minister Yannis Maniatis and
Russian ambassador Vladimir I. Chkhikvishvili, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
