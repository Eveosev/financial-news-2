Turkey  will start oil and gas
exploration in Turkish-controlled northern Cyprus within two
months, Energy Minister  Taner Yildiz  said.  Turkey, which is looking for oil and gas in the eastern
Mediterranean off the divided island, will start searching for
oil and gas in the region of Farmagusta, Yildiz said in
televised comments today. Turkey will start drilling after it
reviews results from seismic studies conducted on land and sea,
he said.  Cyprus has been split since 1974 when Turkey invaded the
island in response to a coup by supporters of union with  Greece .
The European Union, which only recognizes the Greek Cypriot
south of Cyprus, has called on Turkey to recognize Cyprus and
help resolve the ethnic division on the island, withholding
parts of its membership talks.  Turkey will expand the area itâ€™s exploring in and sign up a
second partner following an agreement with Royal Dutch Shell
Plc, Yildiz said.  Turkey is shifting energy exploration to the Mediterranean
from the  Black Sea , Yildiz said. Exploration is conducted in
accordance with international law, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
