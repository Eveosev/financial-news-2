Jeremy Lamb led the ninth-ranked
 University of Connecticut  with 18 points as it logged a 67-53
win over  Harvard University , which was playing its first college
basketball game as a nationally ranked team.  Andre Drummond had 12 points and Ryan Boatright added 11
for the Huskies (8-1), who shot 47 percent from the floor and
connected with half of their 3-pointers last night at Harry A.
Gampel Pavilion in Storrs,  Connecticut .  Connecticut led 30-28 at halftime and outshot Harvard 37-25
in the second half.  The Crimson  (8-1) were led by Kyle Casey who had 12 points.
Harvard was limited to 36 percent shooting from the floor and
made a third of its 3-point shots.  Harvard is No. 25 in this week’s Associated Press poll and
No. 24 in the coaches’ poll, the first time in the program’s
101-year history it has been ranked among the best in the
country.  Princeton was the last Ivy squad to be ranked among the top
25 in the AP poll. The Tigers’ 1997-98 team was No. 8 in the
final AP ranking and No. 16 in the final USA Today poll, which
was then conducted with the National Association of Basketball
Coaches.  To contact the reporter on this story:
