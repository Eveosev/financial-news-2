Coffee production in  Cameroon ,
central  Africa ’s biggest grower of the beans, dropped in the
2010-11 season as some robusta-variety plants became dormant and
illegal trade in arabica rose.  Output of both types dropped 39 percent in the harvest
period to 34,417 metric tons, according to Bloomberg
calculations made using data from the Cocoa and Coffee Board.  Production of robusta, which is used in instant coffee and
espresso, declined to 31,840 tons in the season that started in
October 2010 and ended last month, from 53,000 tons a year
earlier, said Michael Ndoping, the board’s general manager.  “The coffee plants are certainly in their resting period
after previous years of increased production,” he said in a
speech at Angossas, 300 kilometers (186 miles) from the capital,
Yaounde. Production may increase in the next crop, Ndoping said,
declining to give a specific forecast. “The plants are fresh
and have produced enough flowers this year,” he said.  Arabica output slipped to 2,577 tons from 3,423 tons a year
earlier, Ndoping said. The arabica season runs from October to
September.  “A lot of arabica coffee is sold in neighboring  Nigeria ,”
Christopher Mbah, general manager of the North West Cooperative
Association where about 70 percent of the country’s arabica
beans are grown, said by phone. He declined to give an estimate
of the amount of smuggling.  Production of both varieties of coffee is expected to rise
to an annual 125,000 tons by 2015, Ndoping said.  Processing of robusta dropped to 193 tons in 2010-11 from
316 tons a year earlier, while arabica grindings declined 17
percent to 187 tons, according to a report from the board handed
to reporters yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
