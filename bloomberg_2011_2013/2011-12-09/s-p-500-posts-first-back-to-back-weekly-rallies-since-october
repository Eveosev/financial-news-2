U.S. stocks rose, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to its first back-to-back weekly
gain since October, after European leaders agreed to boost a
rescue fund and reports spurred optimism about the economy.  General Electric Co. (GE) ,  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  and Travelers Cos.
climbed more than 3.2 percent to lead advances in the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average . Financial companies in the  S&P 500  climbed
1.7 percent, the most among 10 industries, after European
leaders added 200 billion euros ($267 billion) to the fund and
tightened rules to curb future debts. DuPont Co. dropped 4.2
percent after cutting its earnings forecast.  The S&P 500 climbed 0.9 percent to 1,255.19 after surging
7.4 percent between Nov. 25 and Dec. 2, the biggest weekly
advance since 2009. The Dow rose 164.84 points, or 1.4 percent,
to 12,184.26 this week, extending its 2011 gain to 5.2 percent.  “When you get positive news out of Europe, it allows
investors to focus on the U.S., where the economy appears to be
gaining a little traction,”  Joseph Keating , who helps oversee
$2 billion as chief investment officer at CenterState Wealth
Management in Birmingham, Alabama, said in a telephone
interview. “Basically, any fear about a double-dip recession
has been taken off the table.”  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  erased a weekly loss on Dec. 9 after the
Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan gauge of  confidence  among
consumers topped the median economist projection. Earlier in the
week, data showing that fewer Americans than forecast filed
applications for unemployment benefits added to signs the job
market is improving.  200-Day Average  The gain failed to keep the benchmark index for U.S.
equities above its 200-day average. On each of the first three
trading sessions of the week, the gauge surpassed and then
slipped below its average price from the prior 200 days. It was
the third time since October that rallies fizzled at that level,
which is used by some traders to forecast the market.  “The market is lacking conviction,” Robert Pavlik, chief
market strategist at Banyan Partners LLC in  New York , said in a
telephone interview. The firm manages $1.2 billion. “People are
suspect about growth, or suspect about  Europe . They’re worried
that Europe could have a larger impact on the U.S.”  The  European Central Bank  lowered  interest rates  on Dec. 8
for a second straight month and said it may do more to stimulate
bank lending and fight off a recession.  “It doesn’t look like Europe is collapsing, but where do
we go from here -- what’s going to drive growth in Europe?”
Pavlik said. “Europe could be facing a period of slow economic
growth. That’s keeping investors on the sideline.”  Consumer Sentiment  In the U.S., the Thomson Reuters/Michigan preliminary index
of consumer sentiment rose to a six-month high of 67.7 in
December. The gauge was projected to rise to 65.8, according to
the median forecast of 73 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  GE, the world’s biggest maker of  jet engines , power-
generation equipment, medical-imaging machines and locomotives,
rallied 4.7 percent to $16.84 after raising its quarterly
dividend for the fourth time in two years. Pfizer climbed 3.4
percent to $20.56, and Travelers advanced 3.3 percent to $56.02.  DuPont fell 4.2 percent to $45.04. The chemical maker cut
its 2011 earnings forecast by 10 cents a share because of
falling demand for consumer electronics and plastics and
continued weak demand for construction products.  Gannett Co. rose the most in the S&P 500, surging 12
percent to $13.34. The newspaper owner forecast fourth-quarter
broadcast revenue to rise as much as 11 percent. Lazard Capital
Markets boosted the stock’s rating to “buy” from “neutral,”
citing higher chances for a dividend increase.  Pall Corp. (PLL) , a supplier of filters for drugmakers and
refineries, jumped 5.8 percent to $56.66 after reporting first-
quarter earnings that beat analysts’ estimates.  Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  posted the second-biggest drop in the S&P 500,
sinking 11 percent to $21.79. The oil refiner said it has “no
intent” to resume dividend payments or buy back shares next
year. Credit Suisse Group AG downgraded the stock to “neutral”
from “outperform.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
