Bank Indonesia  Governor Darmin Nasution told the nation’s commercial lenders to lower borrowing
costs as Southeast Asia’s biggest economy looks to domestic
consumption to drive growth amid a global slowdown.  “Starting in 2012, all banks must include targets for
lending-rate reductions and efficiency improvement in their
business plans,” Nasution said in his annual “Bankers Dinner”
speech in Jakarta last night. “Inefficiency in commercial banks
has contributed to high lending rates.”  Nasution and his board kept the central bank’s  reference
rate  at a record-low 6 percent on Dec. 8 after cutting it 75
basis points over the previous two months, joining neighbors in
changing policy direction from combating inflation to shielding
economic growth amid  Europe ’s debt crisis and a U.S. slowdown.
Philippine and Malaysian policy makers held  interest rates  at
their last meetings, while  Thailand  lowered borrowing costs.  “We are optimistic the rate cuts since October will
trigger financing from the domestic market, particularly from
banks,” Nasution said.  Bank Indonesia  forecasts gross domestic product will gain
6.3 percent to 6.7 percent in 2012 from an estimated 6.5 percent
this year, driven by investment growth of as much as 10 percent
and an increase in private consumption of about 5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
