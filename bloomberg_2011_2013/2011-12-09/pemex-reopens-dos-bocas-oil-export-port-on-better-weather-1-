Petroleos Mexicanos , the state-owned
oil company, reopened a second crude-export terminal in the  Gulf
of Mexico  today after weather conditions improved.  The terminal at the port of Dos Bocas reopened, Mexico’s
Merchant Marine said in a weather  bulletin  on its website this
afternoon. Mexico shut its three crude export ports on Dec. 7
amid adverse weather. Cayo Arcas reopened yesterday, while
Coatzacoalcos resumed operations earlier today.  Pemex, the third-largest supplier of oil to the U.S.,
exported 1.361 million barrels of crude a day in 2010. About 84
percent, or 1.139 million barrels, was sold to the U.S. last
year, according to Pemex statistics. Canada is the largest
supplier of crude to the U.S followed by Saudi Arabia.  Cayo Arcas is the Mexico City-based company’s largest
export terminal, followed by Coatzacoalcos and  Dos Bocas ,
respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
