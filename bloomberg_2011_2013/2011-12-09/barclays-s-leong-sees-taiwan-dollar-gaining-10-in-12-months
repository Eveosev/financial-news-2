Wai Ho Leong, senior regional
economist at  Barclays Capital  in Singapore, comments on the
outlook for Taiwan’s dollar and interest rates in a report after
the finance ministry announced yesterday that exports increased
1.3 percent in November from a year earlier.  The Taiwan dollar has dropped 0.6 percent this year to
NT$30.195 against its U.S. counterpart as of 10:32 a.m. local
time, according to Taipei Forex Inc.  “We expect the  Central Bank  of  China  (Taiwan) to keep its
policy rate unchanged at 1.875 percent on Dec. 29. We believe it
is premature for the central bank to cut rates unless there are
more signs of stress in the job market. We expect fiscal pump-
priming to do the heavy lifting in supporting the economy, with
relief for electronic exporters, infrastructure spending and
measures to boost consumption.  “We continue to expect an increased tolerance for a
stronger  Taiwan dollar , as the authorities remain watchful to
limit pass-through from high international energy prices.
Although the near-term outlook is clouded by weaker cyclical
factors, financial volatility and weaker trade performance, the
medium-term drivers of Taiwan dollar appreciation, which are the
strong balance of payments and the prospect of greater economic
integration n with China, remain. Looking beyond the near term,
we expect the Taiwan dollar at NT$27.50 against the U.S.
currency in 12 months.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
