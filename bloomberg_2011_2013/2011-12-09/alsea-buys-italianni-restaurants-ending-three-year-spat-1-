Alsea SAB ,  Mexico ’s largest fast-food
chain operator, agreed to buy the Italianni’s restaurant chain
in Mexico, ending a three-year legal battle.  The deal gives Alsea control of 52 Italianni’s casual
Italian restaurants in Mexico, including 10 operated by third
parties as franchises, Alsea said in a statement to the Mexican
stock exchange today. The rights are good for 20 years and
include an option to extend them for an additional 10 years.  The deal ends a dispute that started when Alsea was sued in
2008 for trying to pull out of the acquisition. Alsea said it
was “satisfied” with the deal. The exclusivity agreements may
buoy optimism among investors concerned about lasting tension
between Alsea and the brand, said Karla Pena, an analyst with
Corp. Actinver SAB.  “If they’d stuck with the old terms of the agreement, it
would’ve been a very rough” relationship, said Pena, who has a
“buy” recommendation on Alsea. “This reduces the
uncertainty.”  Alsea shares rose 2.7 percent to 14.26 pesos in Mexico City
trading. The benchmark  IPC index (MEXBOL)  of 35 Mexican stocks rose 1.6
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
