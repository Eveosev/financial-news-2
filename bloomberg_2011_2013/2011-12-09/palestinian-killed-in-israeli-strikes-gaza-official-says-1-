One Palestinian was killed and at
least 10 others wounded overnight in Israeli air strikes on the
 Gaza Strip , according to emergency medical services head Adham
Abu Selmeya.  The Israeli  Air Force  launched the strikes against what it
said was terror targets in response to the launching of four
rockets into southern  Israel  last night, an army spokeswoman
said, speaking anonymously in accordance with military
regulation. There were no injuries or damage reported from the
rocket attacks, the army said.  The rocket attacks followed an Israel air strike yesterday
in which two Palestinian militants were killed while traveling
by vehicle in Gaza.  After the latest Israeli strike, three missiles fired from
Gaza hit Israeli territory without causing any damage, an army
spokeswoman said, speaking on condition of anonymity according
to military regulations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
