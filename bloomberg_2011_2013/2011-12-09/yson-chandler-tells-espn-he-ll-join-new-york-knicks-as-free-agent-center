Free-agent center Tyson Chandler told
ESPN Radio in Dallas that he will leave the Mavericks to sign
with the  New York Knicks .  “I just think the future of the team, being able to play
alongside Amar’e Stoudemire,  Carmelo Anthony  and the young
talent that they already have puts us in contention over the
next four or five years,” he said in the interview.  Chandler, 29, averaged 10.1 points and 9.4 rebounds for the
National Basketball Association champion Mavericks last season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
