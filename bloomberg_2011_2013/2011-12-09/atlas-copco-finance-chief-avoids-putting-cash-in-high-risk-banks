Atlas Copco AB (ATCOA) , the world’s largest
maker of air compressors, has reviewed its bank deposit policy
due to the euro crisis to ensure it avoids placing deposits in
high-risk banks, Chief Financial Officer Hans Ola Meyer said.  Atlas Copco doesn’t have long-term funds sitting in banks,
and money for short-term liquidity needs is spread between about
10 “core” global and regional banks, including in  Sweden ,
Meyer said yesterday in a phone interview.  Avoiding high-risk banks is a “pretty normal activity but
we have reviewed that” policy due to the growing euro crisis,
he said, declining to identify any banks.  Atlas Copco is benefiting financially from a weakening euro
since the manufacturer has more costs than revenue in the
currency, Meyer said. The Stockholm-based company, whose home
currency is the krona, has no specific plan for the event that
the euro collapses and countries revert to their old currencies,
he said.  “It’s very speculative to have a plan on what to do with
currencies that don’t exist today,” he said. “We’d have to
know more before we could plan for that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
