U.S. soybean inventories before
next year’s harvest will be 18 percent higher than forecast
last month, more than expected, because of falling demand
from overseas, the government said.  Stockpiles  on Aug. 31 will total 230 million bushels,
up from 195 million forecast in November, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said today in a  report . Analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News expected 211 million bushels, on
average. Supplies at the start of this year’s harvest
totaled 215 million bushels, the highest since 2007.  “There is no shortage of soybeans this year,”  Dan Cekander , the director of grain research at Newedge USA LLC
in Chicago, said before the report. “The focus now shifts
to the weather in  South America . Demand may improve if the
current drying trend persists into January and threatens
production.”  Soybean prices have dropped 19 percent this year after
global production increased, reducing demand for U.S.
supplies. Futures for January delivery yesterday rose 0.1
percent to $11.325 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.  The forecast for U.S. exports was cut to 1.3 billion
bushels from 1.325 billion in November. That compares with
1.501 billion bushels in the previous year. The amount of
soybeans that will be processed into  animal feed  and
cooking oil was projected at 1.625 billion bushels, down
from 1.635 in November and down from 1.648 billion last
year.  Falling Exports  As of Dec. 1, U.S. exporters reported sales of 22.054
million tons for delivery in the year ending Aug. 31, down
34 percent from a year earlier, according to USDA  data .
Sales to  China , the biggest global buyer of the oilseed,
were down 25 percent to 15.842 million tons.  Export orders  for soybean meal since Oct. 1 fell to
3.726 million tons as of Dec. 1, down 12 percent from a
year earlier, the USDA said. Soybean-oil sales are 82
percent below the year-earlier pace.  The USDA said this year’s harvest will total 3.046
billion bushels, down 8.5 percent from a record 3.329
billion a year ago. A final crop estimate will be made in
January.  Soybean demand from processors including  Bunge Ltd. (BG) 
and  Archer Daniels Midland Inc. (ADM)  is slowing because of
reduced exports of animal feed and cooking oils.  The average cash price for soybeans in the marketing
year that began Sept. 1 will be $11.70 a bushel, compared
with $12.60 estimated a month ago and $11.30 last year.  World soybean production  will total 259.22 million
metric tons, up from 258.91 million forecast a month ago,
the USDA said. That’s down from last year’s crop of 264.18
million tons.  Global  inventories  of the oilseed on Sept. 30 will be
64.54 million tons, more than the 63.56 million forecast in
November, according to the report. Supplies would be down
from a record 68.43 million tons this year. Traders
surveyed by Bloomberg expected 64.15 million, on average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
