EON AG  may reduce the reach of its
planned job cuts in reaction to a Verdi union strategy paper,
 Financial Times Deutschland  said, citing Sven Bergelin, a member
of the utility’s supervisory board.  The union paper suggests the German company set up a system
of mini-heating and power plants as well as focus on services
such as energy-efficiency advice, the German newspaper said. The
Verdi document will be discussed at a supervisory board meeting
on Dec. 12, FTD said.  EON said last month that planned job cuts would be in the
“upper end” of the 9,000 to 11,000 range.  To contact the reporter on this story:
