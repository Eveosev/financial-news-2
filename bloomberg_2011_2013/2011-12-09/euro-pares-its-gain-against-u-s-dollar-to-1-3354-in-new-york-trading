The euro rose against the dollar and
yen after government leaders holding all-night talks in Brussels
added 200 billion euros ($267 billion) to their crisis-fighting
capacity and toughened anti-deficit rules.  The  Dollar Index (DXY)  fell and higher-yielding currencies gained
after U.S. consumer confidence rose to a six-month high. The 17-
nation currency fell earlier as U.K. Prime Minister  David
Cameron  said there was “fundamental disagreement” in European
Union talks in Brussels and as Finland threatened to withdraw
from the permanent bailout fund if changes to decision making
are introduced.  “Stricter budget rules are probably the most significant
development during this whole crisis,” said  Nick Bennenbroek ,
head of currency strategy at  Wells Fargo & Co . in New York.
“There has been more positive than negative developments. We
managed to get 17 euro zone leaders and some other European
leaders agree to a fairly fundamental change in the way fiscal
policy operates.”  The euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.3386 at 5 p.m.  New York 
time, after gaining as much as 0.7 percent. The shared currency
added 0.3 percent to 103.89 yen and the Japanese currency was
little changed at 77.65 per dollar.  Bennenbroek said he expects the euro to end the year at
$1.30.  Rand Rises  Futures traders decreased their bets that the euro will
decline against the  U.S. dollar , figures from the Washington-
based Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on a decline in the euro compared with
those on a gain -- so-called net shorts -- was 95,814 on Dec. 6,
compared with net shorts of 104,302 a week earlier.  South Africa ’s rand was the best performer against the
dollar, strengthening 2.1 percent to 8.0959 per dollar as stocks
and commodities rose. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced
1.7 percent and the S&P GSCI Index of 24 raw materials climbed
0.2 percent.  The  European Central Bank  was said to buy Spanish and
Portuguese government bonds, with two people saying they saw the
trades for each nation. The sources declined to be identified,
because the trades are private. An official at the ECB declined
to comment.  Europe’s Bonds  Spanish and Italian 10-year bonds erased declines. The
yield on  Spain ’s 10-year securities fell seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 5.75 percent. It earlier rose 17 basis
points. Italian 10-year yields fell 10 basis points to 6.36
percent, after rising 23 basis points to 6.68 percent.  Norway’s krone rose 0.7 percent to 5.7461 against the
dollar and crude oil futures added 1.8 percent to $99.77 a
barrel in New York.  The Dollar Index dropped for the fourth time in five days
as signs the world’s biggest economy will avoid a recession
reduced investor appetite for safer investments. The gauge,
which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses to track the greenback
against six major trading partners, fell 0.3 percent to 78.593.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of consumer sentiment rose to 67.7 this month from 64.1 at
the end of last month.  Won Falls  South Korea ’s won fell against all its major counterparts
after the central bank said the economy is likely to grow 3.7
percent next year, slowing from a 3.8 percent gain this year.
Inflation is forecast at 3.3 percent, compared with 4 percent in
2011, the central bank said.  The won fell 1.4 percent to 1,146.83 per dollar, its worst
daily loss in four weeks.  The euro pared a weekly loss to little changed against the
dollar and a 0.5 percent decline versus the yen.  Finland is ready to withdraw its support from  Europe ’s
permanent rescue mechanism if the Nordic country’s condition of
unanimous decision making is ignored, Finance Minister Jutta
Urpilainen said. Europe’s leaders last night agreed on the need
for a “qualified majority” to speed up decision-making and
prevent individual countries from blocking bailouts.  “The issue that we have is that every single country in
the euro zone has to approve the rules and you’re already
starting to hear countries not keen to lose sovereignty like
that,” said Charles St-Arnaud, a foreign-exchange strategist at
Nomura Holdings Inc. in New York.  The euro has gained 1 percent in a past three months
against nine developed-nation counterparts tracked by the
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes. The dollar
increased 2.9 percent and the Japanese currency was 1.1 percent
stronger.  To contact the reporter on this story:
