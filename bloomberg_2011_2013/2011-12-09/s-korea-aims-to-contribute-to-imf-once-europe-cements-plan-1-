South Korea  signaled it’s prepared to
help expand the International Monetary Fund’s resources once
Europe’s governments have presented a plan to resolve the
sovereign-debt crisis that wins investor confidence.  “We’re closely watching the final outcome of the European
leaders’ meeting,” Sohn Byung Doo, director general of the
Group of 20 bureau at South Korea’s finance ministry, said in a
telephone interview today.  Sohn spoke after the European Union pledged to extend 200
billion euros ($266 billion) to the IMF, part of a wider effort
aimed at encouraging  emerging markets  to help stem a euro-region
crisis that’s dimmed the global economic outlook.  “We can contribute if some conditions are met,” South
Korea’s G-20 chief said. “ Europe  must come up with a workable
plan and a broader map to fight the fiscal crisis that can
restore the market’s confidence. We will also consider other
countries’ moves when deciding how much to contribute.”  In return for extending the help, South Korea will want a
stronger voice in international economic talks, Sohn said.
Developed nations hold the greatest voting share in institutions
including the Washington-based IMF and  World Bank , and Europeans
and Americans have always chosen the heads of the two groups.  “Along with other emerging countries like China and  Brazil ,
we would like to have more of our voices heard at the
international stage in return for our contribution for Europe,”
Sohn said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
