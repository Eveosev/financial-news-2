BHF-Bank AG, the German private bank
that  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  plans to sell, said it appointed Philipp
Nimmermann as the head of equity research, replacing Andrew
Lockhart who left.  Nimmerman, who joined BHF-Bank in 1999, worked as an
economist and strategist at the bank before the appointment,
Juergen Heine, a Frankfurt-based spokesman for the bank, said by
phone today.  Lockhart and Matthias Klein, head of the BHF’s foreign
exchange business, have left, Heine said, without giving an
exact date for the departures.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
