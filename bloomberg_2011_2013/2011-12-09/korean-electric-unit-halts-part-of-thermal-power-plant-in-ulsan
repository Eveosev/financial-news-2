A generator at  Korea East-West Power
Co. ’s thermal-power plant in Ulsan stopped operations yesterday,
the unit of  Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEP)  said.  The 400-megawatt generator, one of nine at the Ulsan plant
southeast of Seoul, halted after a malfunction, two officials at
Korea East-West who asked not to be identified said by phone,
responding to a YTN television report.  The Ulsan plant, with a capacity of 3,000 megawatts,
supplied 2,300 megawatts yesterday and today “as usual” even
as the generator remained shut, the officials said.  Korea East-West Power, based in Seoul, operates five
thermal plants in  South Korea  with combined capacity of 8,814
megawatts. That’s equivalent to almost 12 percent of domestic
electricity supply, according to  its website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
