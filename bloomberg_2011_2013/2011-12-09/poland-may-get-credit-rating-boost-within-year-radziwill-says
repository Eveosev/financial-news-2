Poland may have its credit rating
increased within a year as the government approves steps to
reduce the budget deficit, Deputy Finance Minister  Dominik Radziwill  said today.  The government will draft laws in the coming months that
will “boost the credibility” of the deficit-cutting plans
outlined by Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Nov. 18, he said in
interview in Warsaw. Poland has been rated A-, the seventh
highest investment grade, at  Standard & Poor’s  since 2007.
Moody’s Investors Service has kept the country’s rating at A2
since 2002.  “Within a year we can definitely expect that the rating
agencies will at least raise the outlook on our rating to
positive, or maybe the rating itself,” Radziwill said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
