Swiss stocks (SMI)  climbed, halting two
days of declines, as European Union leaders agreed to add 200
billion euros ($267 billion) to their crisis-fighting war chest
and tighten anti-deficit rules.  Banks paced gains, with  UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) 
advancing more than 2.5 percent.  Swiss Life Holding AG (SLHN)  led
insurers higher, jumping 4.6 percent.  The Swiss Market Index, a measure of the country’s largest
and most actively traded companies, added 1 percent to 5,793.57
at the close in Zurich. The benchmark measure has rallied 21
percent since this year’s low on Aug. 10 on mounting optimism
that policy makers will find a solution to the euro-region debt
crisis. The broader Swiss Performance Index increased 0.9
percent today.  “The leaders have now defined the end point that they want
to reach,”  Thomas Mayer , chief economist at Deutsche Bank AG,
said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “The good news
is that there’s change to the approach. In the past, the summits
were mostly focusing on the the near-term problem. Now they have
decided to move ahead.”  EU policy makers agreed to tighten budget rules for the 17
countries that use the euro. The leaders outlined a “fiscal
compact” to prevent debt building up in future and brought
forward the start of the planned 500 billion-euro European
Stability Mechanism. They also dropped their demand that
investors share the cost of bailouts.  ‘Clear Step’  The euro area’s national central banks will lend 150
billion euros to the International Monetary Fund’s general
resources, while central banks from the non-euro members of the
EU will contribute a further 50 billion euros.  “I think it is a clear step in the right direction,” said
Jon Cox, head of Swiss research at Kepler Capital Markets in
Zurich. “But there is still some way to go in terms of both
credibility of execution, as well as whether the ECB will get
involved. And that has been the problem -- the market has
learned not to trust the ‘still some way to go’ because quite
often that has turned into ‘not going anywhere’ over the last 24
months.”  The leaders said they will set up the ESM in July 2012, a
year ahead of schedule. The EU will reassess plans to cap the
overall lending of the ESM and the temporary fund at 500 billion
euros by March.  Germany  deflected a move to grant the ESM a
banking license, which would have enabled it to multiply its
capacity by borrowing from the ECB.  U.S. Confidence  In the U.S., a report showed that  confidence  among U.S.
consumers rose more than forecast in December to a six-month
high. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of consumer sentiment rose to 67.7 this month from 64.1 at
the end of last month. The median estimate of 73 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a reading of 65.8.  UBS and Credit Suisse,  Switzerland ’s largest lenders,
increased 2.7 percent to 11.42 Swiss francs and 3.5 percent to
22.98 francs, respectively.  Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER) , the 121-
year-old wealth manager, rose 1.9 percent to 34.80 francs.  Swiss Life, Switzerland’s biggest life insurer, gained 4.6
percent to 93.70 francs. Swiss Re Ltd., the world’s second-
largest reinsurer, gained 1.8 percent to 49.46 francs and  Zurich
Financial Services AG (ZURN)  added 2.2 percent to 209.50 francs.  Transocean Ltd. (RIG) , the world’s largest provider of offshore
oil rigs, dropped 2 percent to 39.14 francs.  Syngenta AG (SYNN) , the world’s biggest producer of crop-
protection chemicals, slid 1.4 percent to 263.50 francs.  Wheat futures in Paris extended declines after the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  raised its estimate of global
stockpiles.  Bachem Holding AG (BANB)  slumped 6.7 percent to 34.95 francs, its
lowest price since at least June 1998, after the drug-ingredient
maker cut its 2011 guidance for local-currency revenue growth to
6 percent to 8 percent from 10 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
