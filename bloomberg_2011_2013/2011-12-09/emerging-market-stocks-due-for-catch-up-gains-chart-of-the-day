Emerging-market stocks are due to
catch up with previous post-recession rallies after failing to
keep pace this year, according to Geoffrey Dennis, a Citigroup
Inc. strategist.  The CHART OF THE DAY illustrates how the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index’s performance since October 2008, when its most
recent advance got under way, compares with gains that started
in 2002 and 1991.  MSCI’s gauge surged 66 percent in the third year of the
1990s rally and rose 33 percent during the same period of the
2000s advance. Both rallies occurred after U.S. recessions, as
defined by the  National Bureau of Economic Research . This time,
the index had a third-year loss of 9.6 percent. Its decline for
2011 is steeper, amounting to 18 percent through yesterday.  “Most of the gains in EM equities that we had expected in
2011 should now be captured in 2012,” Dennis wrote in a report
two days ago that included a similar chart. He predicted the
MSCI index will finish next year at 1,225, about 30 percent
higher than yesterday’s close.  Dennis cited three reasons why emerging-market stocks
performed relatively poorly this year. Accelerating inflation
and related interest-rate increases in  developing countries  was
one of them.  Developed countries were responsible for the other two,
according to the report: Concern that the  U.S. economy  and the
federal government’s finances were worsening, and a “debt
crisis roller coaster” in  Europe .  To contact the reporter on this story:
