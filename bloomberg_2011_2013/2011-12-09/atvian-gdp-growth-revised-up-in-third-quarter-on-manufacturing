Latvia’s  economy  grew at a quicker
pace in the third quarter than previously estimated as domestic
consumption, industrial production and construction expanded.  Gross domestic product rose by a revised 6.6 percent from a
year earlier, the Riga-based  statistics office  said. That
compares with a previous estimate for a 5.7 percent expansion
and is the fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 2007, when
the economy expanded 10 percent. GDP grew a seasonally adjusted
1.7 percent from the previous three months, the office said.  The Baltic country’s  economy  began to recover in the second
half of 2010 after a debt-fueled property bubble burst, export
markets closed and lending tightened, erasing almost a quarter
of GDP. The government will have passed tax increases and
spending cuts of about 17.8 percent when including next year’s
budget since turning to a group led by the European Commission
and the  International Monetary Fund  for a 7.5 billion-euro ($10
billion) loan in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
