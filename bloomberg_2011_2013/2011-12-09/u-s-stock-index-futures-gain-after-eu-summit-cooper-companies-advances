U.S. stocks rose, as the  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  advanced for the second straight week, after
European leaders agreed to boost a rescue fund and American
 consumer confidence  topped estimates.  JPMorgan Chase (JPM)  & Co. and  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  climbed more
than 2.3 percent as banks rallied amid optimism on Europe.
 Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  and  Halliburton Co. (HAL)  gained at least 2.8 percent
as investors bought shares of companies most tied to economic
growth.  General Electric Co. (GE)  jumped 3.3 percent after boosting
its dividend. The S&P 500 Consumer Services Index climbed to a
record as  McDonald’s Corp. (MCD)  increased 1.2 percent.  The S&P 500 rallied 1.7 percent to 1,255.19 at 4 p.m. New
York time. The index rose 0.9 percent this week and posted its
first back-to-back weekly gain since October. The measure slid
2.1 percent yesterday as the  European Central Bank  damped
speculation it would boost purchases of  government bonds . The
 Dow Jones Industrial Average  added 186.56 points, or 1.6
percent, to 12,184.26 today.  “Speculation will continue to swirl over what’s coming
from  Europe ,” Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at
Philadelphia-based Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, which manages
$54 billion, said in a telephone interview. “In terms of the
summit leading to a type of cohesive fiscal plan, it appears
something is in order. There’s some relief they did come through
on that front.”  The S&P 500 has struggled to make any headway this year,
down 0.2 percent for 2011, amid investor concern the euro area’s
debt crisis will spread to the 17-nation currency’s larger
economies and trigger a global recession. The measure fell
within 1 percent of a bear market from its high on April 29
through the beginning of October. The gauge has pared the
decline to 8 percent.  Banks Rally  All 10  groups in the S&P 500 (SPXL1)  rallied today. Financial
companies had the biggest advance out of 10 industries in the
S&P 500, rising 2.3 percent.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  increased 3.2
percent to $16.38. JPMorgan Chase climbed 3 percent to $33.18.
Bank of America added 2.3 percent to $5.72.  Investors bought shares of companies closely tied to
economic growth, sending the Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index 1.8
percent higher, while the Dow Jones Transportation Average added
1.9 percent.  Energy and industrial companies had the second- and third-
biggest gains among groups in the S&P 500, advancing at least
2.2 percent. Caterpillar, the world’s largest construction and
mining-equipment maker, increased 3.3 percent to $95.97.
Halliburton, the Houston-based energy services provider, rose
2.9 percent to $34.08.  Summit Agreement  European leaders meeting in Brussels tightened anti-deficit
rules and agreed to boost their crisis-fighting war chest by as
much as 200 billion euros ($267 billion) by funneling money to
the  International Monetary Fund . They outlined a “fiscal
compact” to prevent future debt run-ups and accelerated the
start of a planned 500 billion-euro rescue fund.  U.S. stocks extended gains as confidence among consumers
rose more than forecast in December to a six-month high. The
Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of
consumer sentiment rose to 67.7 from a final November reading of
64.1. The gauge was projected to rise to 65.8, according to the
median forecast of 73 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its tracking estimate for
U.S. gross domestic product growth in the fourth quarter, to 3.4
percent from 2.9 percent, citing improvement in the trade
balance. The trade deficit narrowed in October to the lowest
level of the year, reflecting a drop in imports that will help
give the  U.S. economy  a lift. The gap shrank 1.6 percent to
$43.5 billion, smaller than projected, from $44.2 billion in
September, Commerce Department figures showed.  ‘In Perspective’  “It’s important for investors to keep things in
perspective,” said Jeffrey Schwarte, a money manager who helps
oversee about $231 billion in Des Moines, Iowa at Principal
Global Investors, in a telephone interview. “If you look at the
underlying data in the U.S., it’s actually very strong relative
to other developed markets.”  GE rallied 3.3 percent, the second-biggest gain in the Dow,
to $16.84. The Fairfield, Connecticut-based company said its
board approved a 2-cent increase in the company’s quarterly
dividend to 17 cents a share. The dividend boost is the fourth
since GE resumed increases in July 2010.  McDonald’s, Starbucks  The S&P 500 Consumer Services Index climbed 1.5 percent to
533.21, the highest level on record. McDonald’s, the world’s
largest restaurant chain that has the biggest weight in the
gauge, climbed 1.2 percent to $98.03.  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) , the
world’s largest coffee-shop operator that has the second-largest
weight in the measure, advanced 2.6 percent to $43.96. The
stocks have risen this year 28 percent and 37 percent,
respectively.  DuPont Co. slid 3.2 percent, the biggest decline in the S&P
500, to $45.04. The chemical maker lowered its forecast for 2011
to no more than $3.95 a share from as much as $4.05, missing the
average analyst estimate of $4.04. The Wilmington, Delaware-
based company cited slower growth in certain segments.  Pall Corp. surged 7.9 percent, the second-biggest increase
in the S&P 500, to $56.66. The  supplier of filters (PLL)  for
drugmakers and refineries reported first-quarter earnings were
74 cents a share, exceeding the average analyst estimate of 65
cents.  Earnings Estimates  Cooper Cos. jumped 17 percent to $67.81. The maker of
contact lenses forecast fiscal year 2012 earnings of at least
$4.80 a share, above the average analyst estimate of $4.65 in a
Bloomberg survey.  Myles Zyblock, the chief institutional strategist at  RBC
Capital Markets  in Toronto, lifted his earnings estimates for
 S&P 500  companies in 2011 by $1 to $97 a share. He also boosted
his projection for profit in 2012 to $101 from $100. Zyblock
raised his recommendation on industrial stocks and cut his
rating on phone companies, saying improving economic data
provides a reason for investors to increase cyclical holdings.  “We remain neutral equities,” Zyblock wrote in a note
dated today. “Domestic data has started to come in a little
better than expected in recent weeks. However, these positive
developments are being offset by uncertainty related to the
consequences of a global debt overhang and how policy makers
might respond to the challenge. Volatility will probably remain
elevated until the authorities offer much better policy
visibility.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
