Government programs including food
stamps and school lunches may need to be cut further as
lawmakers attempt to rein in spending and trim the federal
deficit, U.S. Representative Mike Conaway said.  A current farm bill proposal includes $4 billion in cuts to
nutrition-assistance programs over 10 years, compared with $15
billion in reductions to commodity programs including direct
payments to farmers, Conaway said today in a speech at a rice-
industry event in Austin,  Texas . That doesn’t represent a
“proportionate sharing” of cuts, Conaway said.  “There are those of us who believe nutrition has money
that is currently being spent that does not need to be spent,”
said Conaway, a member of the House Agriculture Committee and a
Republican from Texas. “There’s a significant amount of money
that we can eliminate and still not affect one beneficiary’s
calorie intake. We can keep everybody on that’s there, but we
pull out a lot of other stuff. It’s in the billions of
dollars.”  Agricultural committee leaders from the House of
Representatives and Senate recommended to the congressional
supercommittee in October that no more than $23 billion be cut
from farm programs over the next 10 years. The proposal also
included $6 billion in reductions to conservation programs and a
$2 billion reinvestment in other areas, Conaway said.  The proposed $23 billion in total cuts likely “will be the
ceiling in the Senate, and it’ll be the floor in the House,” as
lawmakers discuss the farm bill next year, Conaway said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
