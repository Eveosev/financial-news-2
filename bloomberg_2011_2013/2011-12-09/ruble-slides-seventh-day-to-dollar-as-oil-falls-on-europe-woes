The ruble weakened for a seventh day
against the dollar, its longest losing streak in almost three
years, as oil fell on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will hobble
the global economic recovery and before anti-government protests
tomorrow.  The Russian currency lost 0.3 percent to 31.455 per dollar
at the close in Moscow, extending its weekly loss to 1.9
percent. The ruble slid 0.4 percent to 42 per euro, leaving it
down 0.3 percent at 36.2002 against the central bank’s target
dollar-euro basket.  Crude, Russia’s main export earner, headed for its biggest
weekly decline since September, after a summit of European Union
leaders failed to forge a unanimous accord, damping prospects
for a rapid resolution to the region’s debt crisis. Protest
organizers in Moscow expect more than 20,000 people to gather in
the center tomorrow to protest alleged electoral fraud in the
Dec. 4 parliamentary vote.  “The global environment is setting the stage for cutting
risky trades, and the domestic situation in  Russia  is the actual
trigger to sell the ruble,” Peter Rosenstreich, chief currency
analyst at Swissquote Bank SA in Geneva, said by e-mail.
“There’s nothing investors would like less than graphic
protests over the weekend -- it makes for sudden knee-jerk
reaction trades when they walk in the door on Monday morning.”  Investors increased bets the ruble would weaken further,
with non-deliverable forwards showing the currency dropping to
31.9328 per dollar in three months, compared with expectations
of 31.8890 per dollar yesterday.  Russia’s $3.5 billion of bonds due 2020 rose for a third
day, pushing the yield down five basis points to 4.523 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
