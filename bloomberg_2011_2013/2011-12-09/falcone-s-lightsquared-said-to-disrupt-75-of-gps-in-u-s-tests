Philip Falcone ’s proposed
LightSquared Inc. wireless service caused interference to 75
percent of global-positioning system receivers examined in a
U.S. government test, according to a draft summary of results.  The results from testing conducted Oct. 31 to Nov. 4 show
that “millions of fielded GPS units are not compatible” with
the planned nationwide wholesale service, according to the draft
seen by Bloomberg News.  “LightSquared signals caused harmful interference to
majority of GPS receivers tested,” according to the draft
prepared for a meeting next week of U.S. officials reviewing the
 LightSquared  proposal. “No additional testing is required to
confirm harmful interference exists.”  LightSquared, backed by $3 billion from Falcone’s Harbinger
Capital Partners hedge fund, faces challenges from makers of
global-positioning system devices who say the service will
disrupt navigation by cars, boats, tractors and planes. U.S.
regulators are withholding approval as they check on claims of
interference.  The Reston, Virginia-based company has proposed offering
high-speed mobile  Internet service  to as many as 260 million
people using 40,000 base stations. The service would operate on
airwaves formerly reserved mainly for satellites, and near those
used by GPS devices.  LightSquared is proposing to operate at a lower power than
the level used during the tests, and believes that its
operations would affect about 10% of devices, Martin Harriman,
executive vice president, said in an interview.  ‘Harmful Interference’  The tests worked off an “extraordinarily conservative”
threshold and didn’t show the devices’ performance was affected,
Harriman said.  “If we’re affecting the performance of the device -- my
goodness, we’d like to be sure that doesn’t happen,” Harriman
said.  The laboratory testing was performed for the  National
Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) Systems
Engineering Forum , an executive branch body that helps advise
policy makers on issues around GPS. It found that 69 of 92, or
75 percent, of receivers tested “experienced harmful
interference” at the equivalent of 100 meters (109 yards) from
a LightSquared base station.  The devices tested include those used for automobile and
boat navigation. The forum is to present its results on Dec. 14
in  Washington .  High-Precision Receivers  The testing was requested by the National
Telecommunications & Information Administration, a Commerce
Department agency that oversees airwaves use. The agency is
still reviewing data, Moira Vahey, a spokeswoman, said in an
interview today.  The government is to test high-precision receivers, used in
 farm equipment  and scientific instruments, next year.  Agencies participating in the testing included the
 Department of Defense  and the  Federal Aviation Administration ,
according to the draft summary. Companies participating included
GPS makers  Trimble Navigation Ltd. (TRMB)  and  Garmin Ltd. (GRMN) , farm-gear
maker  Deere & Co. (DE) , and  General Motor Co. (GM) ’s OnStar unit,
according to the summary.  LightSquared is “outraged by the illegal leak of
incomplete government data,” Harriman said in an e-mailed
statement. “This breach attempts to draw an inaccurate
conclusion to negatively influence the future of LightSquared
and narrowly serve the business interests of the GPS industry.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
