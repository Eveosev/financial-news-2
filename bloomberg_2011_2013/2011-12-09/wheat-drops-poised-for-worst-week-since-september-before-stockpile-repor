Soybeans fell in  Chicago  before the
U.S. Department of Agricultureâ€™s report that may show an
increase in U.S. stockpiles as global demand shifts to cheaper
supplies from other exporting nations.  The estimate for stockpiles before the 2012 harvest will be
raised to 211 million bushels from 195 million bushels last
month, according to the median estimate of 26 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg News. Prices jumped 2.6 percent last week.  Dennis Gartman , an economist and editor of the Gartman
Letter in  Virginia , said in his letter today that estimates
average 213 million bushels.  Soybeans for January delivery fell 0.1 percent to $11.315
a bushel by 11:54 a.m. London time on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The oilseed is down 0.4 percent this week.  Corn for delivery in March gained 0.4 percent to $6.0275 a
