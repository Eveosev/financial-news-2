Malaysia’s ringgit was poised for a
weekly decline as concern Europe’s debt crisis will slow Asian
growth outweighed government data that showed the nation’s
exports grew more than economists estimated.  The currency dropped for a second day as the  MSCI (MXAP)  Asia-
Pacific Index of shares fell after the  European Central Bank 
damped speculation it would step up debt purchases. A report
today showed  overseas sales  increased 15.8 percent in October
from a year earlier, compared with the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey for a 7.3 percent gain and less than the 16.6
percent increase in September.  “Concerns of a global slowdown are hurting the outlook for
Malaysia’s exports,”  Hideki Hayashi , a researcher at the Japan
Center for Economic Research in Tokyo, said before the today’s
data was released. “Asian currencies, including the ringgit,
are seeing downward pressure after the ECB damped speculation
over bond purchases.”  The ringgit slumped 1 percent this week and 0.7 percent
today to 3.1535 per dollar as of 12:34 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 3.1583
earlier, the weakest level since Dec. 1. The currency may
retreat to around 3.20 by the end of the year, Hayashi said.  Industrial  production  rose 2.8 percent in October from a
year earlier, compared with a revised increase of 3 percent the
previous month, the statistics department said yesterday.  The yield on the 3.434 percent notes due August 2014
declined two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, this week
to 3.04 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia. The rate fell one
basis point today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
