What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 7 cents to 15 cents a bushel lower
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade after the government forecast
rising U.S. and world inventories before the 2012 harvest,
Jacquie Voeks, a senior market adviser for the Stewart-Peterson
Group in West Bend,  Wisconsin , said in a telephone interview.
Soybean-oil futures are expected to open 0.3 cent to 0.4 cent a
pound lower, and soybean-meal futures may open down $2 to $5 per
2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 10 cents to 15 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  after the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said
global stockpiles next year will rise to a 10-year high, Voeks
said.  -- Corn futures are called to open 4 cents to 7 cents a bushel
lower in Chicago after the USDA said world reserves before next
seasonâ€™s harvest will rise more than expected, Voeks said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
