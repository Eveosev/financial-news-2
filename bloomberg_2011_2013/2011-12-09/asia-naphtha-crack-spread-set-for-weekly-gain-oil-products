Asia ’s naphtha crack spread is poised
for a weekly increase. Fuel oil extended a discount to crude,
signaling widening losses for refiners turning oil into residual
products.  Light Distillates  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures
climbed $6.03 to $104.78 a metric ton at 12 p.m. Singapore time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack spread, a
measure of refining profit, has widened 59 percent from last
week and is headed for the third gain in four weeks.  Japan ’s open-specification naphtha forward contracts for
second-half January delivery were bid at $894 a ton against
offers at $897, based on data from Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte,
a broker. Yesterday, the petrochemical feedstock closed at
$913.25, decreasing for the first time in 13 days.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha yesterday dropped to $11.40 a
barrel, the lowest since May 23, Bloomberg data showed. A
narrowing  reforming margin  indicates it is less profitable to
produce motor fuel.  Middle Distillates  The  premium  of gasoil, or diesel, to Asian marker Dubai
crude slid 4 cents to $18.60 a barrel, according to PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a broker. This crack spread is poised to
increase this week for the first time in four weeks.  Gasoil  swaps for January fell $2.25, or 1.8 percent, to
$123.60 a barrel, PVM said. Prices are set for a third weekly
decline in four weeks. Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil lost 30
cents to 65 cents, the lowest so far this month. A narrowing
 regrade  shows it is less profitable to make  aviation fuel  over
diesel.  Fuel Oil   Fuel oil’s  discount  to Dubai crude widened 17 cents to
$5.69 a barrel, according to PVM. The difference is set to widen
for a second week.  January  high-sulfur fuel oil  swaps dropped $15, or 2.3
percent, to $645.50 a ton, based on PVM data. Prices are the
lowest since Oct. 11. The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to
380-centistoke grade, or the  viscosity spread , added 50 cents to
$14.50. This means bunker, or marine fuel, fell more than
higher-quality fuel oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
