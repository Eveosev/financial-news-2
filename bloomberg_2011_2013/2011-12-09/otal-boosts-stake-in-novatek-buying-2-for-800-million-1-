Total SA (FP)  bought 2 percent of OAO
 Novatek (NVTK)  for about $800 million, boosting its stake in Russia’s
fastest-growing gas producer to 14.1 percent.  The French energy producer bought the shares from Novatek’s
two main shareholders, it said today in a statement. Chief
Executive Officer Leonid Mikhelson and billionaire partner
Gennady Timchenko control Novatek, Russia’s biggest independent
gas producer.  Novatek, which today said it plans to double gas production
by 2020, in March picked Total as a partner for its Arctic Yamal
LNG project. The two billionaires at the same time sold 12
percent in Novatek to Total for about $4 billion. The Paris-
based producer may increase its stake in Novatek to 19.4 percent
within three years, under the accord.  Total owns 20 percent of the Yamal LNG project, which is
set to start production of liquefied gas for transportation by
tanker at the end of 2016.  Novatek is seeking to supply the fuel to Europe, Asia and
 South America  via transshipment, according to a  presentation  on
the producer’s website. Total will finance about 35 percent of
Yamal LNG costs via contribution to charter capital, and about
30 percent via shareholder loans, according to the presentation
that put Novatek’s total investments at about $18 billion to $20
billion. The Russian company aims to bring in more partners, and
project financing will also be used.  Novatek’s shares rose 28 percent in the past year, while
the bigger rival and export monopoly  OAO Gazprom (GAZP)  declined 12
percent. Novatek climbed 0.4 percent in Moscow to 391.86 rubles.
Total advanced 2.7 percent to 38.92 euros in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
