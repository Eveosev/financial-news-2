Yields on Turkish 10-year bonds
dropped to their lowest level in a month as  Europe  planned to
boost its rescue fund and tighten budget deficit rules, spurring
investor confidence in the region that accounts for almost half
of the country’s exports.  Yields on  government bonds  maturing Jan 15, 2020 fell for a
third day to 9.73 percent, the lowest level since Oct. 11.  European Union countries purchased 47 percent of Turkish
exports this year through September, up from 46 percent in
2010, according to government data. Leaders holding all-night
talks in Brussels added 200 billion euros ($267 billion) to
their crisis-fighting warchest and tightened anti-deficit rules,
an accord hailed by European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi 
as a “very good outcome.”  “We are seeing very serious interest in 10-year bonds and
they performed really well,” Bugra Bilgi, a hedge fund manager
at Garanti Asset Management, said in e-mailed comments.
Fundamentals support longer-term Turkish bonds, he said.  Yields  on the benchmark two-year bonds increased three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 10.31 percent, a
Royal Bank of Scotland index of securities showed. The lira was
little changed at 1.8467 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
