Ben Roethlisberger  returned in the
second half after leaving the field before halftime with a leg
injury to lead the Pittsburgh Steelers to a 14-3 win over the
 Cleveland Browns .  Roethlisberger endured an ankle sprain to finish with 280
yards and two touchdown passes as the Steelers improved to 10-3
for first place in the American Football Conference North. The
 Baltimore Ravens  are 9-3 in the division ahead of the Dec. 11
visit of the winless Indianapolis Colts.  Three minutes after Phil Dawson kicked a 20-yard first-
quarter field goal for the Browns last night at Heinz Field in
Pittsburgh, Roethlisberger threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to
Jerricho Cotchery.  The quarterback left the in a National Football League game
with just over five minutes left in the first-half for x-rays,
which were negative. Limping through the second half,
Roethlisberger connected with Antonio Brown on a 79-yard scoring
pass with 2:52 remaining to seal its fourth straight win.  Roethlisberger completed 17 of 22 passing attempts and had
one interception.  Cleveland  has lost three consecutive games to drop to 4-9
for the season and fourth place in the AFC North.  Colt McCoy connected with 18 of 35 passing attempts for 209
yards and two interceptions for the Browns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
