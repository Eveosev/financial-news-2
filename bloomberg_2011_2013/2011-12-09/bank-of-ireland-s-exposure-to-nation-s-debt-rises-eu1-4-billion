Bank of Ireland Plc (BKIR) , the nation’s
largest bank, increased its exposure to the government’s
sovereign debt by 1.44 billion euros ($1.93 billion) in the
first nine months of the year, Irish central bank figures show.  The Dublin-based bank’s net Irish sovereign holdings on its
available-for-sale book rose to 4.57 billion euros during the
period, according to figures prepared as part of European
Banking Authority stress tests, published late yesterday.  “The increases are consistent with the widely-reported
reinvestment of some of the capital the government injected into
the banks this year,” via contingent capital bonds, said
 Stephen Lyons , a fixed-income analyst at Dublin-based securities
firm Davy, in an e-mail response to questions.  The banks issued so-called co-co bonds to the state in
return for cash injected as part of the recapitalization of the
financial system. Lenders offset the 10 percent coupon on those
securities by buying the country’s sovereign bonds, the Sunday
Business Post reported Oct. 9, without citing anyone.  The yield on the Irish 5 percent security due October 2020
rose 5 basis points to 8.82 percent as of 13:20 p.m. in  London ,
That’s fallen from 15.5 percent in July.  Allied Irish Banks Plc’s (ALBK)  net Irish sovereign debt position
rose 9 percent to 5.49 billion euros. Irish Life & Permanent
Plc’s exposure rose 30 percent to 2.39 billion euros, though it
declined 6.4 percent on an assets available-for-sale basis to
1.73 billion euros.  Officials at Allied Irish and Irish Life weren’t
immediately able to comment. A Bank of Ireland spokeswoman
declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
