Moscowâ€™s city government approved a
request by political activists to hold a rally with as many as
30,000 people tomorrow to protest the Dec. 4 vote for
parliament, deemed neither free nor fair by European observers,
RIA Novosti reported.  The city granted permission to increase the size of the
rally after organizers moved the location to Bolotnaya Square
from Revolution Square, the state-run news service reported
today. The city previously said any demonstration at Revolution
Square would be limited to 300 people.  To contact the reporters on this story:
