Eric Lipkin, a former Bernard L.
Madoff Investment Securities LLC employee who pleaded guilty to
falsifying documents to help carry out the biggest  Ponzi scheme 
in U.S. history, is continuing his cooperation with authorities,
prosecutors said.  U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain today approved a
request by federal prosecutors for a six-month postponement of
Lipkin’s sentencing, scheduled for Dec. 15, “given Lipkin’s
continuing cooperation with the government.”  Lipkin, who faces as many as 70 years in prison for his
role in the Madoff fraud, will be sentenced June 15.  Lipkin pleaded guilty in June to six criminal counts,
including conspiracy, falsifying records and bank fraud. He
agreed to cooperate with the government in its investigation of
the fraud at his former firm, which was made public with founder
 Bernard Madoff ’s arrest in December 2008.  Lipkin admitted he falsified documents to show non-existent
account holdings, to put people on the Madoff payroll who didn’t
work for the firm and to fraudulently apply for a construction
loan. He is free on $2.5 million bond.  Madoff, 73, is serving a 150-year term in a North Carolina
prison.  The case is U.S. v. Lipkin, 10-CR-228, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of  New York  ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
