The Australian and New Zealand
dollars fell to one-week lows on speculation a European summit
will fail to push the region’s debt crisis toward a resolution,
damping demand for higher-yielding assets.  The so-called Aussie and kiwi headed for weekly declines
after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said he
hadn’t signaled stepping up bond purchases to spur growth.
European leaders battled into the night at the summit to halt
two years of debt-driven turmoil in financial markets and dispel
concerns the euro is on the brink of unraveling.  “The market continually sets itself up for disappointment
from these summits,” said Derek Mumford, a Sydney-based
director at Rochford Capital, a currency-risk management firm.
“With the Aussie dollar, we see anything over $1.0250 up to
$1.04 as selling opportunities.”  The Australian dollar declined 0.6 percent to $1.0102 as of
2:39 p.m. in Sydney, after touching $1.0093, the lowest since
Nov. 30. It’s poised for 1.2 percent drop this week. The Aussie
fell 0.7 percent to 78.42 yen.  New Zealand ’s dollar retreated 0.8 percent to 76.68 U.S.
cents, after sliding to as low as 76.61, also the weakest since
Nov. 30. The kiwi was set for a 1.4 percent weekly loss. It slid
0.8 percent to 59.52 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
