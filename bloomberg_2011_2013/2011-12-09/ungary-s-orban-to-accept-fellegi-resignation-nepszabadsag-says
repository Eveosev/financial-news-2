Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban 
will almost certainly accept the resignation of Development
Minister Tamas Fellegi,  Nepszabadsag  reported, citing
unidentified people close to the government.  Fellegi offered to resign yesterday after the Cabinet
rejected several draft laws he supported, a number of senior
ministry officials quit, and he wasn’t able to sell as much in
bonds to China as anticipated, the newspaper said.  Fellegi yesterday cited the need to concentrate on his role
as Hungary’s chief negotiator with the  International Monetary
Fund  as the reason for his decision to resign.  To contact the reporter on this story:
