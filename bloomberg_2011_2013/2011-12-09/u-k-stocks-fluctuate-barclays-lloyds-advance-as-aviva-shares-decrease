U.K. stocks (UKX)  rose, paring a weekly
decline, as European Union leaders pledged that national central
banks will channel 200 billion euros ($268 billion) through the
 International Monetary Fund  to fight the debt crisis.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  and  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  climbed more than
5 percent.  Bellway Plc (BWY)  added 2.8 percent after the U.K.
homebuilder that focuses on first-time buyers predicted that
completed sales will increase.  The benchmark FTSE 100 Index gained 45.44, or 0.8 percent,
to 5,529.21 at the close in  London , paring this week’s drop to
0.4 percent. The gauge has rebounded 12 percent from this year’s
low on Oct. 4 amid mounting optimism that euro-area leaders will
agree measures to end the debt crisis. The FTSE All-Share Index
rose 0.9 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index added 0.8
percent.  “The 200 billion euros of additional funds from nations is
positive,” said Virginie Maisonneuve, head of global equities
at Schroder Investment Management Ltd., which oversees $284
billion. “You have companies that are plays on the global
economy that will be doing well and that have been penalized
extremely strongly.” She spoke in a Bloomberg Radio interview
with Ken Prewitt.  The FTSE 100’s 6.3 percent slump this year has left the
gauge trading at 9.3 times the estimated profits of its
companies for 2012, compared with an average price-earnings
ratio of 11.3 over the past five years, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The gauge slid as the euro area’s debt
crisis spread to the 17-nation currency’s larger economies.  National Central Banks  An EU accord  issued this morning said that the euro area’s
national central banks will lend 150 billion euros to the IMF’s
general resources, while central banks from the non-euro members
of the EU will contribute a further 50 billion euros.  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said the leaders of the
euro area reached a deal to tighten budget controls. The leaders
outlined a “fiscal compact” to prevent debt from building up
in future and brought forward the start of the planned 500
billion-euro permanent rescue fund by a year.  Barclays, the U.K.’s second-largest bank by assets, rose
5.4 percent to 190.2 pence and Lloyds climbed 6.5 percent to
26.72 pence.  Bellway advanced 2.8 percent to 749 pence after saying its
completed sales will increase by about 5 percent in the six
months through January.  African Barrick Gold Plc lost 2.1 percent to 509 pence
after saying that fourth-quarter output will miss previous
forecasts because of power cuts in  Tanzania .  Paddy Power Plc (PWL)  slid 2.5 percent to 40.62 euros in Dublin
after Bank of America Corp. cut its recommendation on the stock
to “underperform” and an Australian parliamentary committee
recommended keeping a ban on live online gambling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
