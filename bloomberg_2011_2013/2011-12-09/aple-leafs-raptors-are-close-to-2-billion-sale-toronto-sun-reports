The  Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan  is
close to completing the $2 billion sale of its majority stake in
the parent of Toronto’s Maple Leafs and Raptors to Bell Media
and  Rogers Communications Inc. ,  the Toronto Sun reported .  The media companies will split the 79.5 percent stake in
 Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment Ltd. , the Sun said. The
announcement could come as early as today.  In addition to the  National Hockey League ’s Maple Leafs,
who have won the Stanley Cup 11 times, and the  National
Basketball Association ’s Raptors, Maple Leaf Sports owns FC
Toronto of  Major League Soccer .  The Maple Leafs are the NHL’s most valuable franchise at
about $521 million, Forbes said Nov. 30, up from $505 million a
year ago. The Raptors are worth $399 million, placing them 10th
out of 30 NBA franchises, Forbes said in January.  A sale of the Maple Leafs and Raptors must be approved by
the NHL and NBA, the Sun said. Bell would have to divest its 18
percent stake in the Montreal Canadiens hockey team, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
