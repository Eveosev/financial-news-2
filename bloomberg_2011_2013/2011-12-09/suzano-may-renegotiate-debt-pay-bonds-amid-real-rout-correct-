Suzano Papel & Celulose SA , a
Brazilian pulp producer, may renegotiate  bond  covenants or pay
down 635 million reais ($351 million) of the securities after a
weaker local currency boosted the value of its dollar debt.  “If the real devaluates further, we will do one of the two
alternatives,” Chief Executive Officer Antonio Maciel Neto told
reporters today in Sao Paulo. “We have enough cash and this is
the most expensive debt that we have.”  Salvador , Brazil-based Suzano’s bond covenants mandate that
its debt remain below 4 times earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization. Debt surpassed that level in the
third quarter after the local currency’s plunge increased the
value of its dollar obligations, and it risks breaching the
covenant if it tops the limit for a second time.  Brazil ’s real
dropped 17 percent last quarter, the worst performance of the
world’s 16 most-traded currencies.  The company also plans to sell assets in a bid to reduce
net debt to as low as 3.5 times Ebitda, Maciel Neto said. Suzano
had net debt of 5.3 billion reais at the end of the third
quarter, according to its financial statements.  Suzano rose 2 centavos, or 0.3 percent, to 7.16 reais at
4:51 p.m. in Sao Paulo trading. Earlier, it declined as much as
2.5 percent.  Yields on Suzano’s dollar bonds due in 2021 rose for the
first time in eight days, climbing seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 7.20 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
