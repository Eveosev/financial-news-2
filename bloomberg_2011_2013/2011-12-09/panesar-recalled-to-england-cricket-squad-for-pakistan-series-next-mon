Monty Panesar was recalled to the
 England  cricket squad for the Test series against Pakistan in
the United Arab Emirates beginning next month.  Panesar will be the second spin-bowling option to Graeme Swann. The left-hander has not played a Test for England since
the 2009 Ashes series against Australia.  “Monty’s selection comes off the back of a strong domestic
season with Sussex and with the potentially spin-friendly
conditions of Dubai and Abu Dhabi in mind,” Geoff Miller,
England national team selector, said in a  statement .  Batsman Eoin Morgan returns to the squad for the first time
since having shoulder surgery in September, while bowlers Stuart Broad and  Chris Tremlett  are also coming back from injuries.  The three-game series will be England’s first since a 4-0
sweep of India in August propelled it to the top of the
International Cricket Council  Test rankings . The series opens in
Dubai beginning Jan. 17, followed by games in  Abu Dhabi  starting
Jan. 25 and Dubai beginning Feb. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
