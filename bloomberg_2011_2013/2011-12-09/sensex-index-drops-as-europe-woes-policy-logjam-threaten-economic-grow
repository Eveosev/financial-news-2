India’s benchmark stock index posted
its biggest two-day drop in almost three months amid concern a
freeze in decision-making by the government and Europe’s debt
crisis will stall growth in the South Asian nation.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , India’s largest company, tumbled
3 percent to a two-week low as Nomura Holdings Inc. downgraded
the shares. Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  backtracked this week
on plans to allow overseas retailers including  Wal-Mart Inc. (WMT)  to
expand in the country, undermining efforts to revive growth and
deepening a yearlong paralysis in policy making. The BSE India
 Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  has slumped 21 percent this year, faster than
the 19 percent drop in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.  “India may continue to underperform emerging markets for
now because policy inaction and corruption scandals are pushing
investors away,” Adrian Mowat, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Hong
Kong-based chief Asia and emerging-market strategist, said in an
interview to Bloomberg UTV today. “Growth is slowing and
headline inflation” hasn’t come down as fast as expected.  The Sensex slumped 274.78, or 1.7 percent, to 16,213.46 at
the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai, its steepest two-day loss since
Sept. 23. The gauge, which lost 3.8 percent this week, rallied
the most in 2 1/2 years last week on speculation the central
bank may boost cash as China cut the reserve ratio for banks for
the first time since 2008. As many as 26 of the 30  stocks (MXAPJ)  in the
measure retreated today.  Euro Concerns  Asian stocks declined for a second day, with the  MSCI Asia
Pacific Index (MXAP)  losing 2 percent on economic reports indicating
Europe’s debt crisis is contributing to slower growth in Japan,
South Korea and China. Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  sank 1.5
percent after a report showed the nation’s economy grew less
last quarter than the government’s initial estimate. South
Korea’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  declined 2 percent after producer prices
rose at the slowest pace in a year in November.  European leaders holding all-night talks in Brussels added
200 billion euros ($267 billion) to their crisis-fighting fund
to halt two years of debt-driven turmoil in financial markets
and dispel concerns that the 17-nation euro currency is on the
brink of unraveling. Europe is  India ’s biggest trading partner.  The Sensex was Asia’s worst performer yesterday after
 Reserve Bank  of India Deputy Governor Subir Gokarn said Dec. 7
the central bank won’t compromise on its fight to tame inflation
to ease a cash deficit. Policy makers are concerned that adding
cash by freeing up a part of the reserves held by banks will fan
inflation that has stayed above 9 percent all year, even after
seven interest-rate increases.  Food Prices  Still,  food inflation  slowed to the lowest level in more
than three years in the week ended Nov. 26, the trade ministry
said yesterday, giving the central bank more scope to pause rate
increases when it meets Dec. 16.  The S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India Ltd. fell 1.6 percent to 4,866.7. Its December futures
traded at 4,882.25. The  BSE-200 Index (BSE200)  lost 1.4 percent.  Reliance retreated 3 percent to 755.70 rupees, the lowest
close since Nov. 25. Nomura downgraded the stock to ‘neutral’
from ‘buy’ and cut its price estimate 18 percent to 870 rupees,
citing a likely slowdown in earnings.  Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. (STLT) , the biggest copper maker,
slumped 3.3 percent to 101.30 rupees.  Bharat Heavy Electricals
Ltd. (BHEL) , India’s biggest power-equipment maker, slid 3.3 percent to
263.75 rupees, extending yesterday’s 5.7 percent retreat.  Bajaj
Auto Ltd. (BJAUT) , the second-biggest motorcycle maker, lost 3.3 percent
to 1,670.35 rupees and  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM) , the biggest
sports-utility vehicle maker, sank 3.7 percent to 703.25 rupees.  Sensex Target  CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets yesterday reduced its 12-month
Sensex target to 17,000 from 18,200, citing lower earnings and a
“political logjam.” The brokerage cut its earnings estimate
for Sensex companies by 3 percent to 1,269 rupees per share for
the year to March 2013, joining Credit Suisse Group AG, which on
Dec. 7 pared its forecast by 7 percent to 1,300 rupees.  The Sensex trades at 13.9 times future earnings, down from
21.5 times in March 2010. The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  is
valued at 9.6 times.  India’s economy grew 6.9 percent in the September quarter,
the slowest pace in two years, as rising borrowing costs and
accelerating inflation cooled demand.  Industrial production  in
October may drop 0.7 percent, the first contraction since June
2009, according to the median estimate of 24 economists in a
Bloomberg survey. The government will release the data Dec. 12.  Foreign  funds  have reduced holdings of domestic shares by
$2.4 billion from a record $104.4 billion in July, contributing
to the slide in stocks and the rupee, which tumbled to a record
52.73 per U.S. dollar on Nov. 22.  The currency slid 6.7 percent in November, the most since
March 1992, and is heading for its second-worst year against the
dollar since 1991, when Singh, then India’s finance chief, began
a shift toward free-market policies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
