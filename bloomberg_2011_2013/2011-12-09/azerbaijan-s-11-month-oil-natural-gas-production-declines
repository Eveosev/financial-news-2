Azerbaijan , the third-largest oil
producer in the former  Soviet Union , pumped less oil and natural
gas in the first 11 months of the year.  Oil production fell 11 percent to 42.2 million metric tons
and gas output declined 2.6 percent to 23.7 billion cubic
meters, an official from the State Statistics Committee said by
phone from the capital of Baku today. The official, who wouldn’t
be named because of policy, gave no reason for the decline.  Officials of State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, also known as
Socar, earlier said oil output was declining because of
increased safety measures at the  BP Plc -operated Azeri-Chirag-
Guneshli field following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.  The country produced 51 million tons of oil and 26 billion
cubic meters of gas for the whole of last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
