National Basketball Association
Commissioner  David Stern  said today he vetoed the trade of  Chris
Paul  to the  Los Angeles Lakers  because it was “more valuable”
to keep the All-Star guard with the  New Orleans Hornets .  Stern spoke in a brief interview at the NBA’s New York
headquarters building a day after blocking Paul’s trade to the
Lakers.  NBA spokesman Tim Frank said earlier that the deal was
blocked for “basketball reasons.” The league owns the Hornets
and is trying to sell the club.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
