DTEK, Ukraine’s largest private power
producer, bought a 25 percent stake in PAT  Kyivenergo , a state-
owned energy generating and distribution company, in a tender
organized by the country’s state property fund.  DTEK offered 450.5 million hryvnia ($56.3 million) for the
stake, according to state property fund’s  website  today. It
outbid energy distributor PAT Poltavaoblenergo.  DTEK is owned by Ukraine’s richest man, Rinat Akhmetov. The
company will complete next year the purchase of another energy
producer, Zakhidenergo, based in the western city of Lviv.  To contact the reporters on this story:
