United Nations climate negotiators in Durban have thrown enough barbs at the U.S. this week to make  Washington  seem like the last place anyone would want to say the word "carbon." Enter Peter Graf, chief sustainability officer of enterprise-software maker SAP. Graf came to town to speak on a National Academies panel and to meet with Michelle Moore, the White House's Federal Environmental Executive. That's a little-known post created early in the Clinton administration to "strengthen the role of the Federal Government as an enlightened, environmentally conscious and concerned consumer," according to Executive Order 12873. I asked Graf about what, from his sustainable business perspective, the U.S. should be doing. The U.S. government faces some of the same pressures as large corporations that have reorganized their supply chains to avoid waste, inefficiency and blame for suppliers' poor environmental or social practices, Graf said. Wal-Mart, Nestle and Nike understand that if anything goes wrong anywhere in their supply chains, it's the biggest brands that have the highest risk of being blamed, be it for food-borne illness, unethical labor practice, or corruption. That's especially true when the brand is "the  United States ." President  Barack Obama  issued an executive order in October 2009 that directs federal agencies to improve their environmental, energy use and economic metrics. Taking a close look at federal suppliers could save taxpayers a lot of money, and help realize policy ambitions, a phenomenon that in the private sector has become known as the Wal-Mart effect. The federal government will achieve some of its climate goals more quickly by emulating sustainable business practices than it will by waiting for Congress to enact legislation. Two years after Executive Order 13514, Obama's directive is beginning to come to life, as Bloomberg's Nishad Majmudar  wrote  this week. The  General Services Administration  spends $90 billion a year, and has begun the arduous training of staff on new protocols for evaluating suppliers. "They are definitely getting interested in what they call 'responsible acquisition,'" Graf said, noting that the U.S. isn't calling it "green procurement." The segments of government that think like businesses, or are starting to, are likelier to harvest the fruits of sustainability strategy. The contrast couldn't be starker between civil servants counting contractors' carbon and climate diplomats emitting hot air in Durban,  South Africa , where international discussions over the last two weeks have produced few results. Graf put it more diplomatically: "What we see happening in the business world is a bit different than what we see happening in the policy sphere."
