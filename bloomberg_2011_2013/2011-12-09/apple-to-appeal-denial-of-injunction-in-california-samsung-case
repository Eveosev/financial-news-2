Apple Inc. (AAPL)  said it will appeal a U.S.
judge’s refusal to block sales of Samsung Electronics Co.’s 4G
smartphone and Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet computer.  The Cupertino, California-based maker of the iPhone and
iPad will seek review of a Dec. 2 ruling by a judge in San Jose,
California, with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit in  Washington , according to a filing today by Apple’s
lawyer, Michael Jacobs.  Apple sought an order blocking Samsung from selling its
Galaxy line of mobile devices products in the U.S. based on
claims they violate Apple patents. The lawsuit is part of a
legal battle between the companies being fought in 10 countries.  The two companies have filed at least 30 lawsuits against
each other, according to Samsung. The conflict began in April,
when Apple filed the San Jose lawsuit claiming the Suwon, South
Korean company’s Galaxy devices copied the iPhone and iPad.  The case is Apple Inc. v.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) ,
11-01846, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Jose).  To contact the reporter on this story:
