Moody’s Investors Service today cut
ratings on  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA, BNP Paribas SA and Credit
Agricole SA, citing worsening liquidity and access to funding.  The ratings service said in a statement that the
probability that Societe Generale will get systemic support is
very high.  Each of the three banks had their long-term debt and
deposit ratings cut by one step.  To contact the reporter on this story:
