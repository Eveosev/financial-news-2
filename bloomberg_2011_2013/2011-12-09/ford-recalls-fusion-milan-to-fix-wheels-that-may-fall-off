Ford (F)  Motor Co. is recalling 128,616
Fusion and Mercury Milan sedans to fix defective wheels that may
fall off, the U.S. Transportation Department said.  The cars’ wheel studs may fracture while driving, leading
to “vibration and/or wheel separation, increasing the risk of a
crash,” the  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said 
in a notice on its website today.  Ford will notify owners. Dealers will replace lug nuts on
all four wheels and inspect rear-wheel disc brake surfaces and
replace them as necessary for some of the sedans with the model
years 2010 and 2011, the agency said.  “Affected customers can continue to drive their
vehicles,” said Susan Krusel, a spokeswoman for Dearborn,
Michigan-based Ford. “We are not aware of any accidents or
injuries.”  Ford plans to notify owners beginning the week of Jan. 24,
Krusel said. Customers can ask their dealers to inspect the lug
nuts to make sure they’re properly attached, she said.  The recall covers cars originally equipped with 17-inch
steel wheels built in 2009 and 2010 at a plant in Hermosillo,
 Mexico , NHTSA said in a  letter  to Ford. The wheels were supplied
by Hayes Lemmerz International Inc. in Northville,  Michigan , and
the brakes were supplied by Brembo North America Inc. in
Plymouth, Michigan, the agency said.  NHTSA began investigating Jan. 21, according to agency
documents. The agency at the time was aware of 29 owner
complaints, including four instances in which wheels had fallen
off, and 128 warranty claims Ford had paid for fractured wheel
studs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
