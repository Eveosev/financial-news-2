Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group Ltd.,
the company with revenue greater than  Tiffany & Co. (TIF) , raised
HK$15.8 billion ($2 billion) after selling shares at the bottom
of a  price range  marketed to investors, said two people with
knowledge of the matter.  The company sold 1.05 billion shares at HK$15 apiece, said
the people, asking not to be identified because the information
is private. Chow Tai Fook had offered the shares at HK$15 to
HK$21 each, according to its  IPO prospectus . Had the jeweler
sold the shares above $18.52 apiece, the IPO would have been
Hong Kong’s biggest this year.  Chow Tai Fook joins a growing list of companies that have
priced their stock offerings at or near the minimum amount
sought as stocks have tumbled in  Hong Kong  amid concerns about
 Europe ’s debt crisis. New China Life Insurance Co. priced its
$1.9 billion Hong Kong and Shanghai IPO near the bottom of its
marketed range yesterday, and HKT Trust’s $1.2 billion November
IPO was priced at the low end.  “The poor reception to IPOs reflects weak global investor
sentiment,” said Cedric Ma, Hong Kong-based senior strategist
at Convoy Asset Management Ltd., which oversees the equivalent
of $260 million. “The market is also looking a little bit
crowded since a lot of companies are trying to raise cash at the
same time.”  Busiest Month  Chow Tai Fook and New China Life are among companies
raising more than $5 billion from initial public offerings in
Hong Kong this month. The offerings may make December the
busiest month for new share sales in the city this year, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  The jewelry chain, controlled by billionaire Cheng Yu Tung,
joins Italian fashion house  Prada SpA  in raising funds in Hong
Kong, where luxury-goods companies tap  China ’s growing
affluence. Prada raised $2.5 billion in June, and its shares
have dropped 10 percent from the offer price.  Priced at the bottom of its range, Chow Tai Fook is valued
at about 15 times estimated net income for the year ending March
2013, one of the people said. Tiffany, the New York-based luxury
jewelry retailer, trades just below 16 times the average analyst
estimate for earnings for the year ending January 2013, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Chow Tai Fook posted sales of HK$35 billion for the 12
months to March 31, 46 percent more than Tiffany’s full-year
revenue.  Big Blessing  Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC Holdings
Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co. managed the IPO for Chow Tai Fook.
Joseph Lo, an external spokesman for Chow Tai Fook at Brunswick
Group, declined to comment.  Founded in 1929 in the southern Chinese city of  Guangzhou ,
the company was named after founder  Chow Chi Yuen . “Tai Fook”
means “big blessing” in Chinese. The company, with more than
1,400 outlets in greater China, plans to start trading on Dec.
15, the prospectus shows.  The shares priced with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index down 2.6
percent as of the midday close today. The benchmark is down 19
percent this year. Baoxin Auto Group Ltd, a dealer of BMW and
Land Rover cars in China, also priced its $415 million Hong Kong
IPO at the bottom of the range marketed to investors, and Citic
Securities Co., raised $1.8 billion in September after selling
shares in the low end of its pricing range.  Chow Tai Fook has 12.6 percent of China’s jewelry market,
with a 20 percent share in Hong Kong and Macau, the company said
in the IPO filing, citing a Frost and Sullivan report. It
sources rough diamonds from companies such as  Rio Tinto  and
Diamond Trading Co., the distribution arm of  De Beers .  Retail sales in China have  grown  an average of 17 percent
in the first ten months of this year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. In Hong Kong, Chinese visitors splurging on high-
end shoes, watches and jewelry have driven monthly retail  sales 
to record highs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
