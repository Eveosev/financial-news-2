Huawei Technologies Co.,  China ’s
largest maker of phone equipment, said it will voluntarily
restrict business in Iran because of the “increasingly complex
situation” there.  Huawei won’t seek new customers in Iran and will limit the
scope of business with existing ones, the Shenzhen, China-based
company said in a statement on its website yesterday.  All of its business in Iran has been “in full compliance
with all applicable laws and regulations including those of the
UN, US and EU,” the company said. For communications networks
already delivered or in process of delivery to customers in
Iran, Huawei will continue to provide “necessary services to
ensure communications for Iran’s citizens” the statement said.  Huawei last month confirmed it sold telecommunications
equipment and a “mobile news delivery platform” to MTN
Irancell Telecommunications Services Co.,  Iran ’s second-largest
mobile provider, and denied the gear was intended for use in
censorship.  Bloomberg News and the Wall Street Journal published
reports in October that Iranian authorities use technology
purchased from foreign companies to monitor dissidents.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
