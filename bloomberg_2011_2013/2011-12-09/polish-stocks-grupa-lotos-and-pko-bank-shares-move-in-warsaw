Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  climbed 15.05,
or 0.7 percent, to 2,226.88 at the end of trading in Warsaw,
trimming this week’s drop to 1.4 percent.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, rose for a third day, adding 1.2
percent to 125 zloty. Copper increased on speculation top global
consumer China might take more steps to stoke growth after
inflation slowed and industrial production climbed less than
forecast.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN)  , Poland’s biggest oil company, gained
for the first time in four days, climbing 1.3 percent to 38.5
zloty. Oil rose after a report showed that confidence among U.S.
consumers rose to a six-month high and as Europe agreed to boost
its rescue fund and tighten budget rules.  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO)   jumped as much as 2.4 percent
to 33.89 zloty before closing up 0.1 percent at 33.15 zloty.
Poland’s largest bank doesn’t need to raise extra capital as
part of measures introduced by the European Banking Authority in
response to the euro area’s sovereign debt crisis, it said in a
statement on its website late yesterday.  Separately, the bank stopped granting home loans in Swiss
francs and is withdrawing from euro-denominated mortgages, Chief
Executive Officer Zbigniew Jagiello told  Puls Biznesu .  To contact the reporter on this story:
