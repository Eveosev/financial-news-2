PT Pertamina will probably drop plans
to import liquefied natural gas because the price is too high, a
company official said.  Pertamina, the Indonesian state-owned oil and gas company,
may not go ahead with plans to import LNG because the price has
soared to a range of $16.50 to $22 Mmbtu, Mochamad Harun, a
company spokesman, said today in Jakarta.  The company needs 10 million metric tons of LNG annually by
2013 to supply 12 projects, including a floating storage re-
gasification unit in West Java and an LNG receiving terminal in
Central Java, according to data from Pertamina. It has so far
secured 1.5 million tons of LNG supply, Harun said.  “The chance for importing LNG is slim at current high
price,” said Harun. “We hope the government will ask LNG
producers to sell more to the domestic market.”  PT Pertamina Gas, a unit of Pertamina, was in talks with
Qatar Gas Transport Co., Petroliam Nasional Bhd. and Royal Dutch
Shell to import LNG for the Central Java terminal, Gusti Azis,
Pertamina Gas’s director of operation said on June 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
