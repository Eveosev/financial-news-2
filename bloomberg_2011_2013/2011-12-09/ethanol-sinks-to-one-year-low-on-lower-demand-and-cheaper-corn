Ethanol futures fell, capping the
worst week in three years, on lower demand for the biofuel and
cheaper corn.  Futures decreased after an Agriculture Department report
showed unsold supply of U.S. corn before next year’s harvest
will be 0.6 percent larger than a previous estimate. The
department said demand for corn to make ethanol will slip to 5
billion bushels from 5.021 billion a year earlier.  “We had the report that came in line pretty much with what
people were expecting,” said Justin Dirico, senior ethanol
trader at SCB & Associates in  Chicago .  Denatured ethanol for January delivery fell 1.8 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $2.115 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the lowest price in 52 weeks. Futures dropped 16 percent this
week, the worst performance since December 2008. Prices have
dropped five of the past six weeks.  In cash market trading, ethanol on both the West Coast and
in  New York  increased 12.5 cents, or 5.2 percent, to $2.55 a
gallon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf jumped 7.5 cents, or 3.1 percent,
to $2.525 a gallon and in Chicago the biofuel rose 2 cents, or
0.9 percent, to $2.325.  Corn for March delivery slumped 6 cents, or 1 percent, to
$5.9425 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
