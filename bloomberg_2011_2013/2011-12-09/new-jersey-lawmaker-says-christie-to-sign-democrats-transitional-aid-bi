New Jersey Governor  Chris Christie 
will sign Democratic lawmakers’ $140.5 million version of a bill
to provide aid to distressed cities, Senate Budget Committee
Chairman Paul Sarlo said in a telephone interview.  Sarlo, a Wood-Ridge Democrat, said he spoke with Christie
yesterday and the governor, a first-term Republican, will
“definitely” sign the measure.  Kevin Roberts , a spokesman for Christie, declined to
immediately comment on Sarlo’s statement. Christie had proposed
a $139 million version of the measure that included spending
$1.5 million for oversight. Democrats added the $1.5 million to
their legislation, which passed the Assembly earlier this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
