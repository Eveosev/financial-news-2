General Electric Co. (GE)  raised its
quarterly dividend 13 percent, the fourth increase in less than
two years as Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey Immelt  returns cash
to investors.  The dividend, which rose to 17 cents a share from 15 cents,
is payable Jan. 25 to shareholders of record on Dec. 27, GE said
today in a statement. The shares rose 3.3 percent to $16.84 at
4:15 p.m. in  New York , the highest since Oct. 28.  Analysts including JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s C.  Stephen Tusa ,
Citigroup Inc.’s Deane Dray and Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.’s
Steven Winoker have estimated in recent weeks a raise that would
push the yield from 3.62 percent to above 4 percent, or about 17
cents a share. Bloomberg analysts also projected an increase of
2 cents.  “This comes in as expected but is nonetheless a
positive,” Tusa wrote in a note to clients today. He has an
overweight rating on the shares.  This week, finance executives told investors that they
expect about $6.3 billion to $6.5 billion in  net income  from GE
Capital Corp., evidence of a rebound from the market turmoil and
economic slump of 2008.  “The dividend announcement is totally appropriate for
where we are in the credit cycle and GECC’s earnings outlook,”
said  Joel Levington , managing director of corporate credit at
Brookfield Investment Management Inc. in New York.  GE cut its shareholder payout in February 2009 for the
first time since the Depression to conserve cash as the global
recession and credit crunch drained profit from the Fairfield,
Connecticut-based company’s finance unit.  GE had $91 billion in cash at the end of the third quarter,
after paying $3.3 billion in October to repurchase preferred
stock sold to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. as
financial markets froze three years earlier.  The Berkshire stake carried a 10 percent annual dividend,
or about $300 million, and Immelt has said the redemption should
boost earnings by 3 cents a share next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
