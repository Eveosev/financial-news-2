Nordex SE , a German wind turbine-
maker, won an order to supply a 52.5-megawatt power project in
 Norway .  Nordex signed a contract to deliver 21 of its 2.5-megawatt
machines to a wind farm built by a company owned by the
utilities Ostfold Energi AS, Vardar AS and Fitjar Kraftlag, the
Hamburg-based company said today in  statement . No terms were
given.  Construction of the Midtfjellet farm on the Norwegian
island of Stord is to begin next summer, with completion
scheduled for 2013, Nordex said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
