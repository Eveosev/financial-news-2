Olivier Desbarres, head of foreign-
exchange strategy for Asia-Pacific ex-Japan at  Barclays Capital 
in Singapore, comments on intervention by Asian central banks in
a press briefing:  Asian central banks “don’t want their currencies weakening
aggressively because there is still sticky inflation in the
region: Singapore,  China , and  South Korea  in particular. Of
course, India is an obvious one. At the same time, they don’t
want their currencies appreciating rapidly because we are seeing
a global growth slowdown.  “When we speak to the central banks the message we get
from them is: ‘we’re not too uncomfortable with the levels of
our currencies; what we don’t like is volatility.’ So a lot of
the measures that you see in Asia are to some extent designed to
minimize day-to-day, week-to-week volatility.  “For them to have their currencies broadly trading in line
with their trade partners, they don’t have to intervene in the
foreign-exchange market aggressively. They are on a comfortable
holding pattern.  “In the risk-on scenario, you would expect Asian central
banks to control the pace of appreciation. In a very extreme
scenario, they might even revisit  capital controls . Central
banks are more willing to use their reserves when they feel they
are being picked on for one-off non-fundamental reasons.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
