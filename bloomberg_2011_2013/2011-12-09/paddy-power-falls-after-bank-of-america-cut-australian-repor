Paddy Power Plc (PAP)  fell the most in four
months after  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  cut its recommendation on the
stock to “underperform” and an Australian parliamentary
committee recommended keeping in place a ban on live online
gambling.   Paddy Power fell as much as 5.2 percent in Dublin trading,
the biggest intraday fall since August 4, and traded 2.1 percent
lower at 40.79 euros as of 9:31 a.m. Bank of America cut Paddy
Power from “neutral” citing downside risks to the Dublin-based
bookmakers profitability from the potential imposition of 15
percent U.K. online tax on gross profit from 2014.  Separately, an Australian parliamentary committee
recommended in a non-binding report that a ban on live in-play
online gambling be maintained. While the recommendations are
“negative” for online operators in  Australia  such as Paddy
Power, Dublin-based securities firm Davy said the ban would have
no material effect on its estimates for Paddy Power.  Paddy Power has online gambling operations in both the U.K.
and Australia and generated 81 percent of operating profit from
online activities in the first half.  About 73 percent of
operating profit came from outside of Ireland, the company said
Aug. 30.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
