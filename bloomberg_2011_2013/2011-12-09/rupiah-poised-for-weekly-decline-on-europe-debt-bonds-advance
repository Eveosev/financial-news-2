Indonesia’s  government bonds  advanced
for a second week as overseas investors boosted holdings of the
nation’s assets on optimism the central bank is buying the
securities. The rupiah fell.  Bank Indonesia  is committed to buying government bonds in
the secondary market, Perry Warjiyo, director for economic
research and monetary policy, said Nov. 29.  Foreign holdings  of
government debt increased to 215.98 trillion rupiah ($23.7
billion) on Dec. 5, from 214.9 trillion at the end of last week,
according to finance ministry data.  “The central bank has acknowledged buying the government
bonds,” said Radhika Rao, an economist at Forecast Pte in
Singapore. “Bank Indonesia has been in the market and it has
managed to keep the rupiah somewhat steady.”  The yield on benchmark 8.25 percent notes due July 2021
fell 11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, this week to
6.17 percent today, according to midday prices from the Inter-
Dealer Market Association. The rate was unchanged today.  Bank Indonesia kept its benchmark interest rate at 6
percent yesterday, a decision predicted by 17 of 22 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. Five forecast a quarter-percentage-point
cut.  The currency fell today as the  MSCI Asia-Pacific Index (MXAP)  of
regional shares dropped after French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
said British Prime Minister  David Cameron  made “unacceptable”
demands regarding treaty amendments.  The rupiah dropped 0.4 percent this week to 9,090 per
dollar as of 3:40 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from
local banks compiled by Bloomberg. It declined 0.3 percent today
and touched 9,240 on Nov. 29, the weakest level since June 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
