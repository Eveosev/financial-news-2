Hong Kong’s government could hold off
on changing its curbs on the housing sector and take “some
time” for an evaluation as prices haven’t declined sharply,
Peter Wong,  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ’s Asia Pacific head told reporters
in the city today.  The city’s banking system won’t be much affected unless
there’s a severe fall in home prices, Wong said.  Hong Kong will ease some of its property-cooling measures
if home prices extend their decline amid Europe’s worsening
credit crisis and a global economic slowdown,  John Tsang , the
city’s financial secretary, said Dec. 6. Prices are slowly
coming down, and the government is seeking to achieve a “soft
landing,” Tsang said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
