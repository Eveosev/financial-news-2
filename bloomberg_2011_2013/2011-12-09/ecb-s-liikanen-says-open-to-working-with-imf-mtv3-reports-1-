European Central Bank council member
Erkki Liikanen said he is open to working with the  International
Monetary Fund , broadcaster  MTV3 reported  on its website.  “The IMF has a great advantage in crisis situations from
its credibility and experience,” said Liikanen, who also heads
the Bank of Finland in Helsinki. “All this temporary funding
must be conditional. This is why we are open and positive, as
long as things are done by the book.”  European leaders agreed last night to provide 200 billion
euros ($267 billion) of new crisis fighting funds to the IMF
through the region’s national central banks. Each country holds
the key in fixing its own public finances, Liikanen said.  The ECB cut its benchmark interest rate yesterday to 1
percent to “support economic growth in this difficult
situation,” Liikanen said. “Inflation risks are balanced at
the moment.”  The ECB must ensure the transmission of monetary policy and
conducts “temporary operations” to that end, Liikanen told
MTV3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
