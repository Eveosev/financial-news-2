White House spokesman  Jay Carney  said
a plan by House Republicans to extend a cut in workers’ payroll
taxes “makes harmful cuts” and puts the burden “on working
families.”  He said the White House is “open” to other ways to pay
for extending the payroll  tax cut . He also objected to
Republicans’ plan to attach a provision expediting a Canadian
oil pipeline.  The bill “shouldn’t be larded up with measures that are
either totally extraneous, or designed to re-fight old
ideological battles, or actually harm people that the tax cut is
supposed to help,” Carney said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
