Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta  next
month will unveil results of the  Pentagon ’s strategic review of
U.S. roles, missions and worldwide posture, his spokesman said
today.  “Specific plans for public rollout haven’t been finalized,
but you can expect the secretary and other officials to start to
talk about the strategy we have worked through, the process by
which we are building the fiscal 2013 budget and eventually the
budget itself,” spokesman  George Little  told reporters.  Then-Defense Secretary  Robert Gates  earlier this year, when
the review was announced, said it was important for the public
and Congress to get a full understanding of strategic choices
for the U.S. military as it faced $450 billion in additional
reductions through 2021, including about $261 billion through
2017.  The formal budget is released in February.  “You can expect the secretary to talk publicly in January
about the strategy,” Little said. “This is something he thinks
is extremely important to convey to the American people -- what
the American military in the 21st century is going to do and
what some of those trade-offs might need to be” to accommodate
a shrinking budget.  “It’s not just about the budget but the capabilities of
the U.S. military and the threats we will continue to face,”
Little said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
