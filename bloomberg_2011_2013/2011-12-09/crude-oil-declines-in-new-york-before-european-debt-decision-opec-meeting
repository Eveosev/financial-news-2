 Oil fell in  New York  as investors
speculated that fuel demand will falter amid signs Europe is
struggling to tame its sovereign debt crisis.  Crude for January delivery slid as much as 56 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $97.78 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange and was at $97.85 at 2:08 pm Sydney
time.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  signaled the
ECB won’t increase government bond purchases to end the crisis.
Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest crude exporter, is in no rush
to agree to a new OPEC quota at the group’s Dec. 14 meeting, Oil
Minister Ali al-Naimi said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
