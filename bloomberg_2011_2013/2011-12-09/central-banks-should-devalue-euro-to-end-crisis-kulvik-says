Central banks should consider
devaluing the euro toward parity with the dollar to help resolve
 Europe ’s debt crisis, said Hannes Kulvik, a Geneva money manager
and former economic adviser to the Finnish government.  “There is one more option” to save the euro region, said
Kulvik, who oversees about 150 million euros ($201 million)
including equities at  Sifter Group . “Increase competitiveness
and growth through a controlled depreciation of the euro.”  Central bank governors should coordinate intervention in
 currency markets  in a move similar to the 1985 Plaza Accord,
Kulvik said in an interview in Geneva. Governments concerned
about trade imbalances met 26 years ago at the Plaza Hotel in
 New York  and agreed to devalue the dollar. Kulvik’s native
 Finland  devalued its currency in 1991.  A weaker currency may increase the value of companies’
assets outside the euro area and boost earnings, helping to
stimulate European economies threatened by recession, according
to Kulvik, who was an economic adviser to former Finnish
president Martti Ahtisaari.  The euro traded at $1.3358 as of 10.39 a.m. in  London ,
after gaining almost 12 percent against the dollar since last
year’s June 7 low. The currency will strengthen to $1.37 by
Sept. 30 next year, according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts.  A forced depreciation of the euro isn’t a likely outcome of
discussions between European governments, said Johannes Jooste,
a strategist at Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch Wealth
Management. “Our expectation is for the euro to weaken on its
own,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
