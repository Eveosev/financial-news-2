The Dutch economy probably fell back
into a technical recession in the second half the year as
 Europe ’s debt crisis intensified, according to the country’s
central bank.  The economy shrank 0.3 percent in the third quarter and
there’s “no reason to assume growth resumed” in the current
three-month period, the Amsterdam-based central bank said on its
 website  today. A recession is defined as two consecutive
declines in gross domestic product. The central bank cut its
forecasts for 2011 and 2012 economic growth and said
unemployment will rise through 2013.  “The unknown outcome of the European debt crisis causes a
lot of uncertainty,” the central bank said. “In the short-
term, decisions must be taken that are crucial for the
functioning of the European monetary union.”  European leaders started talks in Brussels late yesterday
on a strategy to end the crisis that’s threatening to tip Europe
back into recession. The  European Central Bank  cuts it  benchmark
interest rate  yesterday and offered banks unlimited cash for
three years to boost lending.  The Dutch central bank said the economy of the Netherlands,
the fifth-largest in the euro area, may expand 1.4 percent this
year, compared with a June estimate of 2.2 percent. It lowered
its 2012 growth forecast to 0.2 percent from 1.7 percent. The
economy may grow 1.3 percent in 2013, it said.  Unemployment will rise to 5.3 percent in 2012 and 5.9
percent in 2013 from 4.4 percent this year, according to the
central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
