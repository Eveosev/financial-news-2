Crude-oil shipments hauled by
supertankers bound for  China  rose 10 percent this week,
according to ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.  Vessels with a total carrying capacity of 17.6 million
deadweight tons are heading for the East Asian nation, up from
16.1 million tons in the week ended Dec. 2. In tonnage terms, 14
percent of the total  fleet  of the largest  oil tankers  signaling
future destinations is bound for China, the world’s largest
energy consumer.  The following table shows the destinations of very large
crude carriers and their combined carrying capacity in
deadweight tons, according to Bloomberg data. Average drafts are
expressed as a percentage of maximum sailing depth and are an
indication of cargo size. Each country’s percentage share of
total oil shipments is shown for the current and prior weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
