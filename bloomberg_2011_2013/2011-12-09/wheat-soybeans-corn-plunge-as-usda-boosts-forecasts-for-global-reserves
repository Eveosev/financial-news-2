Wheat and soybeans fell to the lowest
in more than a year and corn declined after the U.S. government
said global crop inventories will be larger than expected.  World wheat  stockpiles  before the 2012 harvest will total
208.52 million metric tons, 2.9 percent more than projected a
month earlier and the highest since 2000, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said. Global soybean reserves will be 1.5 percent
bigger than last month’s estimate and U.S. stockpiles will rise
to a five-year high. World Corn supplies will be 4.6 percent
higher. The outlook for the crops topped analysts’ forecasts.  “The world carryover projections were larger than expected
and are negative for all three crops,”  Mark Schultz , the chief
analyst for Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in  Minneapolis ,
said in a telephone interview. “Prices will have to fall low
enough to generate improved demand.”  Wheat futures for March delivery fell 0.2 percent to close
at $5.96 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, 
after reaching $5.84, the lowest since July 27, 2010. The grain 
has fallen 25 percent in 2011 as record global production 
reduced demand for U.S. supplies.  Soybean futures for January delivery dropped 2.3 percent to
$11.07 a bushel on the CBOT, the biggest loss since Nov. 23.
Earlier, the oilseed touched $11.0025, the lowest since Oct. 8,
2010. The commodity has dropped 21 percent this year.  Corn Falls  Corn futures for March delivery fell 1 percent to $5.9425 a
bushel in Chicago, the largest drop since Dec. 2. The price has
declined 5.5 percent this year.  Combined global wheat and feed-grain  inventories  outside of
the U.S. will rise 3.5 percent from a year earlier to 321.09
million metric tons, the highest in two years, the USDA said.  China , the biggest producer of pork, will harvest 191.75
million tons of corn this year, the most-ever, up 8.2 percent
from the previous record of 177.25 million set last year, the
agency said. Reserve inventories may rise 6.6 percent to 57
million tons, the most since 2003. Two years ago, China became a
net importer of corn for the first time since 1996.  “Total world supplies are in surplus and that will slow
U.S. exports,” said Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness for
Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago. “Confirmation of a
record Chinese crop means they will not be back to buy any U.S.
corn before next June.”  The USDA reduced its forecasts for cash prices for all
three commodities. Soybeans will average $11.70 a bushel in the
current marketing year, down from $12.60 estimated in November.
The outlook for corn was cut 4.5 percent to $6.40, and wheat was
reduced 1.4 percent to $7.30.  “Farmers are selling more corn and soybeans today in the
cash markets, and that is adding some hedge pressure to the
futures,” Grow said. “Farmers are getting uneasy about the
declining trend in prices.”  The U.S. was the largest exporter of all three commodities
in the marketing year that ended Sept. 30. Corn is the country’s
biggest crop, valued at $66.7 billion in 2010, followed by
soybeans, hay and wheat, government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
