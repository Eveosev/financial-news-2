MetLife Insurance Company of
 Connecticut  said the adoption of new rules for deferred
acquisition costs will reduce total equity by $350 million to
$500 million.  The adoption will probably lower earnings from prior
periods, according to a regulatory filing today from the
company, which is a unit of  MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life
insurer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
