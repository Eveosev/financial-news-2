Estonia’s current-account surplus
totaled 300.9 million euros ($402 million) in the third quarter,
or 7.3 percent of economic output, the central bank, based in
the capital, Tallinn, said today on its website.  That’s the biggest surplus since records began in 1993,
according to the bank’s database. The surplus was 2.2 percent in
the previous quarter, and 7.1 percent a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
