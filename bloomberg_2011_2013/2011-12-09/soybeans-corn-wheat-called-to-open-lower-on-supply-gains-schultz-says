Soybean futures may open 6 cents to
10 cents a bushel lower on the  Chicago  Board of Trade after the
government said world inventories before the 2012 harvest will
increase more than analysts expected, said  Mark Schultz , the
chief analyst at Northstar Commodity Investment Co.  Corn futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel lower in
Chicago after the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said domestic
and world stockpiles of the grain will be larger than forecast
last month, Schultz said in a telephone interview from
 Minneapolis .  Wheat futures may open 5 cents to 8 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT after the USDA said global inventories next year will
rise to the highest since 2000, Schultz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
