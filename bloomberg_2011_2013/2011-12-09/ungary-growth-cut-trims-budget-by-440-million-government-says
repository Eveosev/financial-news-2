The Hungarian governmentâ€™s reduced
2012 economic growth forecast translates into a 100 billion
forint ($440 million) budget setback, government spokesman
Andras Giro-Szasz told state-run M1 television in an interview
today.  The budget loss will be manageable because of fiscal
reserves, Giro-Szasz said.  The Cabinet cut its forecast for gross domestic product
growth next year to 0.5 percent to 1 percent from 1.5 percent
earlier. Every 0.5 percentage point reduction affects the budget
by 50 billion forint, Giro-Szasz told M1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
