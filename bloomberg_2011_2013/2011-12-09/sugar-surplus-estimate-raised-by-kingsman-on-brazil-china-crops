Sugar production will exceed demand
by almost 9.7 million metric tons for the 2011-12 season started
in October, up from 8.4 million estimated two months ago on
bigger crops in  Brazil  and  China , researcher Kingsman SA said.  The crop in Brazil’s Center South region, the world’s
biggest producing area, will be 32.77 million tons, up from
31.19 million tons previously estimated, Lausanne, Switzerland-
based researcher Kingsman SA said in an e-mail today. China’s
crop estimate is 12.57 million tons, up from 12 million tons.  Raw sugar prices have dropped 26 percent this year as
demand lagged behind production. The estimate for demand in
 India , the world’s biggest consumer, was raised to 24.51 million
tons from 23.9 million tons.  On a national crop basis, the global surplus estimate was
lowered to 8.2 million tons from 9.2 million tons. For Brazil’s
national crop year which started in April 2011, exports from the
Center South will be 21.6 million tons, up by 450,000 tons from
the previous estimate, Kingsman said.  “All this extra sugar will be exported,” Kingsman said in
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
