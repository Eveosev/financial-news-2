Brazil , the world’s top coffee
producer, may harvest 50 million to 52 million bags next year,
said Silas Brasileiro, the new head of the National Coffee
Council, Dow Jones reported, citing an interview by Agencia

expected,” he said, according to the report. A bag weighs 60
kilograms, or 132 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
