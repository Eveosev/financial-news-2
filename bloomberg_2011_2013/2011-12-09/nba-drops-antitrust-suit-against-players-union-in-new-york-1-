The  National Basketball Association 
dropped its lawsuit seeking to block antitrust claims brought by
the union that represents NBA players.  The league and the National Basketball Players Association
on Nov. 26 announced an agreement in principle on a new labor
deal, paving the way for an end to the lockout that forced the
cancellation of part of the NBA season.  Both sides filed papers in  Manhattan  federal court today
dismissing the suit, which was filed by the NBA in August. The
league claimed the union was using the threat of antitrust
litigation to extract better terms in contract talks.  The move came the day after payers and owners ratified a
10-year labor agreement, which will allow the season to start
Dec. 25. The NBA will play a shortened 66-game season.  National Basketball Association v. National Basketball
Players Association, 11-cv-05369, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
