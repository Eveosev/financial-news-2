The lowest water levels in seven
years on the Danube River has curbed shipping on the central
European waterway, according to Via Donau, an Austrian
government monitoring agency.  The river is the shallowest for November since 2004,
reducing shipping to 25 percent of its normal capacity,
spokeswoman Bettina Pepek said today by phone from Vienna.  The river was 218 centimeters (86 inches) deep today at
Wildungsmauer, near  Austria ’s border with Slovakia, compared
with 321 centimeters a year earlier,  Via Donau ’s data show.  Shipments on the Austrian section of the river totaled 11.1
million metric tons last year, according to Via Donau. Ore and
scrap metal accounted for 31 percent of the goods, petroleum
products 19.5 percent, and agricultural products 16.2 percent,
according to the agency’s annual report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
