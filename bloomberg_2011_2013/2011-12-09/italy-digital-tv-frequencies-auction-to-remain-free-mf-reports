The auction of six Italian digital TV
frequencies will remain free and the rules for assigning the
frequencies won’t change because they have already been approved
by the European commission, MF  reported , citing people close to
the Industry Ministry.  Changing the rules now would be complex and may slow down
the new government at a time when it is working to improve
 Italy ’s economic future, the newspaper said, citing an
unidentified government minister.  To contact the reporter on this story:
