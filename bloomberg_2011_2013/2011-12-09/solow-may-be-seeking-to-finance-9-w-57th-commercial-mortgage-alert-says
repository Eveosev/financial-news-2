New York developer Sheldon Solow may
be seeking about $600 million of financing for 9 West 57th St.,
his trophy office tower near Central Park in midtown  Manhattan ,
Commercial Mortgage Alert said today.  Solow’s debt -- a $400 million interest-only loan on the
building and another $100 million on the land beneath it --
matures in February, the newsletter reported, without saying
where it got its information. Lenders have been approached by
brokers seeking 10-year fixed-rate debt on the property,
according to Commercial Mortgage Alert.  It’s not clear whether the brokers are working on Solow’s
behalf or independently, the newsletter said.  The 50-story, 1.6 million-square-foot (149,000-square-
meter) tower commands some of Manhattan’s highest rents,
particularly for higher floors that have unobstructed views of
the park. Tenants include the private-equity firm  KKR & Co. (KKR) ,
 Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC (OZM) , and luxury-goods maker
Chanel SA, according to the newsletter.  A telephone message left with a receptionist at Solow
Building Co., Solow’s firm, wasn’t immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
