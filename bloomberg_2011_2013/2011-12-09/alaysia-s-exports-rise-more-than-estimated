Malaysia ’s  exports  grew faster than
economists estimated in October as sales of commodities and
energy products surged, a pace that may ease as the threat of a
global recession curbs demand in coming months.  Overseas shipments climbed 15.8 percent to a record 63.6
billion ringgit ($20 billion) from a year earlier after gaining
16.6 percent in September, according to a trade ministry
statement today. The median estimate of 18 economists in a
Bloomberg News  survey  was for a 7.3 percent gain.  Rising overseas sales and investment helped Malaysia’s
growth accelerate in the third quarter as the Southeast Asian
nation weathered the deepening European crisis. Australia,
Thailand and Indonesia have in recent months lowered borrowing
costs to shield their economies as the outlook for Asian exports
wanes, with Malaysia reporting yesterday industrial output
growth eased to 2.8 percent in October.  “The slowdown in global growth momentum is likely to weigh
on Malaysia’s exports growth prospect,”  Gundy Cahyadi , an
economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in  Singapore , said
before the release. “Recent import data has signaled that
domestic momentum may have weakened.”  Liquefied natural gas sales surged 82 percent, shipments of
crude petroleum climbed 87 percent and  palm oil  gained 54.3
percent. Exports of electrical and electronics items fell 9
percent from a year earlier.  Malaysia’s  imports  rose 4.6 percent in October from a year
earlier. The  trade surplus  widened to 13.22 billion ringgit from
9.63 billion ringgit in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
