Quarterback Robert Griffin III is
favored by oddsmakers to become Baylor University’s first
 Heisman Trophy  winner, with a 64 percent chance of being
selected as college football’s top player.  The Heisman Trophy will be presented at a ceremony tonight
in New York, and Griffin is listed as the 1-5 favorite at  Bodog ,
an Antigua-based Internet sports book. University of  Alabama 
running back Trent Richardson is the second choice at 11-4,
followed by Stanford University quarterback Andrew Luck at 5-1.
Luck was the preseason favorite after finishing as runner-up to
Heisman winner Cam Newton last year.  Griffin, a junior, finished the season as the nation’s top-
rated quarterback, completing 72.3 percent of his passes for
3,998 yards, 36 touchdowns and six interceptions. He also rushed
for 832 yards and nine scores as  Baylor  went 9-3 -- its best
season in 25 years -- and had a winning record against Big 12
Conference opponents for the first time.  “You dream it, you want to be there, but when you actually
get there you’re still like, ‘I can’t believe this is
happening,’” Griffin said after being selected as one of the
five finalists this week. “I’m blessed to represent Baylor and
blessed that the guys on this team showed the grit that they did
to get us nine wins and get our name out there.”  Baylor is ranked 12th in the Bowl Championship Series
standings and had a 6-3 record in the Big 12 this season, with
wins against No. 14 Oklahoma, No. 18  Texas  Christian and No. 24
Texas. Before this year, the Bears had an 18-102 record against
conference opponents since joining the  Big 12  in 1996.  Texas Win  In the Bears’ final regular-season game, a 48-24 win
against Texas, Griffin -- who’s nicknamed RG3 -- passed for 320
yards and two touchdowns while running for two more scores.  Baylor will play the University of  Washington  in the Dec.
29 Alamo Bowl. The Bears are making back-to-back postseason
appearances for the first time since 1991-1992.  Richardson follows Griffin with a 20.5 percent chance of
winning the trophy, with Luck at 13 percent, according to R.J.
Bell, the founder of Las Vegas-based handicapping information
website  Pregame.com .  With 50-1 odds,  Wisconsin  running back Montee Ball has a
1.5 percent chance at the award, while Louisiana State
cornerback Tyrann Mathieu, with 100-1 odds, has a 1 percent
chance.  Of the five schools with finalists, only Baylor has never
had a Heisman Trophy winner.  Ingram’s Footsteps  Richardson, a junior, would be the second Alabama running
back to win the Heisman in three seasons.  Mark Ingram  became the
school’s first recipient in 2009.  Richardson had 1,583 yards rushing and 20 touchdowns for
second-ranked Alabama (11-1), which will play LSU for the
national championship on Jan. 9.  Luck is seeking to join Jim Plunkett as Stanford’s Heisman
Trophy recipients after passing for 3,170 yards, 35 touchdowns
and nine interceptions this season. The Cardinal went 11-1, are
ranked fourth in the BCS and will play No. 3  Oklahoma  State in
the Fiesta Bowl.  Ball, a junior, led the nation with 1,759 yards rushing and
32 touchdowns for Wisconsin (11-2), which will play  Oregon  in
the  Rose Bowl . He leads the country with 38 touchdowns overall,
one shy of the single-season record at college football’s top
level set by  Barry Sanders , the 1988 Heisman winner at Oklahoma
State.  Ball is the first Heisman finalist from a  Big Ten  school
since Ohio State’s Troy Smith won in 2006. Wisconsin’s two
Heisman winners were Ron Dayne in 1999 and Alan Ameche in 1954.  Rare for Defense  Mathieu was voted the  Southeastern Conference ’s defensive
player of the year and finished the season ranked second in punt
returns. Nicknamed “The Honey Badger,” Mathieu returned a punt
62 yards for a score as LSU beat Georgia 42-10 in the conference
title game Dec. 2.  Charles Woodson, the 1997 Heisman Trophy winner from the
University of Michigan, was the only player to receive the award
while playing primarily on defense. Woodson, like Mathieu,
played cornerback and returned kicks.  LSU’s only Heisman winner was Billy Cannon in 1959.  To contact the reporter on this story:
