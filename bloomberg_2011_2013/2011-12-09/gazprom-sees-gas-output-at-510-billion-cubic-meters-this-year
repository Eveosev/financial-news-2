  OAO Gazprom , the world’s biggest gas
producer, plans to raise output at least 2.5 percent in 2012
after slow growth this year.  Russia’s biggest company set a target of 522.5 billion
cubic meters next year from estimated output of 510 billion this
year, said Nail Gafarov, deputy head of the production
department.  Next year’s production may reach 528 billion cubic meters
depending on the markets and a “cold winter,” Gafarov told
reporters today in Moscow. That remains below the 2008 level,
before the economic crisis cut European demand for Russian
supplies. “We have production capacity, we are now talking
about what will happen on the consumer side.”  Gazprom, the world’s biggest gas producer, estimated in
June that 2011 output may climb to 519 billion cubic meters,
while leaving its official target at about 505 billion.  Output will probably grow less than 0.5 percent this year,
based on Gafarov’s estimate and the state-controlled company’s
2010 production of 508.6 billion cubic meters of gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
