Rains and a cold front are delaying
coffee deliveries in  Honduras , Central America’s largest
producer, according to Volcafe, the coffee unit of commodities
trader ED&F Man Holdings Ltd.  Honduras will produce a record 4.6 million bags of 60
kilograms (132 pounds) in the 2011-12 season, up from 4.2
million bags last season and a previous estimate of 4.4 million
bags, the Winterthur, Switzerland-based trader said in its
latest quarterly report.  “Internal market prices are firming up as exporters need
to cover their nearby commitments,” Volcafe said in an e-mailed
note to clients today. “Fresh outside interest was noted from
different regions,” it added.  Beans from Honduras for shipment in January and February
were at a discount of 2 cents a pound to the price on the ICE
Futures U.S. exchange today, Volcafe data show. That compares
with a discount of 1 cent a pound last week, according to the
data.  Coffee from  Colombia , the world’s second-largest producer
of arabica beans, was at a premium of 22 cents a pound above the
exchange price for January and February shipments, unchanged
from last week, the trader said.  Colombian export registrations for October, November and
December so far have totaled 1.76 million bags, “a
disappointing volume,” Volcafe said.  Arabica coffee for March delivery gained 0.3 percent to
$2.2925 a pound by 10:28 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .
Arabica beans are grown mainly in  Latin America  and brewed by
companies such as Starbucks Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
