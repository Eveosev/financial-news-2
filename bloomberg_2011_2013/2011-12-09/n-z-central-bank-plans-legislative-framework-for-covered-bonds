New Zealand ’s central bank is
proposing a legislative framework for covered bonds issued by
the nation’s banks to provide investors with legal certainty on
the structure of the securities.  Covered bonds are backed by assets such as mortgages that
stay on a lender’s balance sheet, called a cover pool. The
 Reserve Bank  is proposing the assets be held by a special-
purpose vehicle and a monitor be appointed to oversee the pool,
according to an e-mailed statement today.  Investors need to have certainty about the treatment of
assets in the unlikely event that the issuing bank becomes
insolvent, deputy RBNZ Governor Grant Spencer said in the
statement. Legislative frameworks exist in most other countries
with covered bond markets, he said.  The Wellington-based central bank issued a  discussion  paper
and is seeking submissions by March 16, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
