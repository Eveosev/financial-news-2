The following is the text of
the U.S. trade balance report for Oct. released by the
Commerce Department.  Goods and Services  The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Economic
Analysis, through the  Department of Commerce , announced
today that total October exports of $179.2 billion and
imports of $222.6 billion resulted in a goods and services
deficit of $43.5 billion, down from $44.2 billion in
September, revised.  October exports were $1.5 billion
less than September exports of $180.6 billion.  October
imports were $2.2 billion less than September imports of
$224.8 billion.  In October, the goods deficit decreased $0.7 billion from
September to $58.8 billion, and the services surplus was
virtually unchanged at $15.3 billion.  Exports of goods
decreased $1.5 billion to $127.8 billion, and imports of
goods decreased $2.2 billion to $186.6 billion.  Exports
of services were virtually unchanged at $51.4 billion, and
imports of services increased $0.1 billion to $36.1
billion.  The goods and services deficit increased $4.0 billion from
October 2010 to October 2011.  Exports were up $19.7
billion, or 12.3 percent, and imports were up $23.7
billion, or 11.9 percent.  Goods (Census Basis)  The September to October decrease in exports of goods
reflected decreases in industrial supplies and materials
($1.3 billion);  consumer goods  ($0.6 billion); foods,
feeds, and beverages ($0.1 billion); and automotive
vehicles, parts, and engines ($0.1 billion). Increases
occurred in capital goods ($0.5 billion) and other goods
($0.2 billion).  The September to October decrease in imports of goods
reflected decreases in industrial supplies and materials
($3.6 billion); automotive vehicles, parts, and engines
($0.6 billion); and other goods ($0.1 billion). Increases
occurred in capital goods ($1.1 billion); consumer goods
($0.7 billion); and foods, feeds, and beverages ($0.2
billion).  The October 2010 to October 2011 increase in exports of
goods reflected increases in industrial supplies and
materials ($8.5 billion); capital goods ($3.8 billion);
automotive vehicles, parts, and engines ($1.5 billion);
consumer goods ($0.8 billion); and foods, feeds, and
beverages ($0.1 billion).  A decrease occurred in other
goods ($0.3 billion).  The October 2010 to October 2011 increase in imports of
goods reflected increases in industrial supplies and
materials ($12.0 billion); capital goods ($4.4 billion);
automotive vehicles, parts, and engines ($2.2 billion);
foods, feeds, and beverages ($1.7 billion); and consumer
goods ($0.9 billion). A decrease occurred in other goods
($0.1 billion).  Services  Exports of services were virtually unchanged from
September to October.  Increases in royalties and license
fees and other private services (which includes items such
as business, professional, and technical services,
insurance services, and financial services) were mostly
offset by decreases in travel, other transportation (which
includes freight and port services), and passenger fares.
Changes in the other categories of services exports were
small.  Imports of services increased $0.1 billion from
September to October.  An increase in other private
services was partly offset by a decrease in passenger
fares.  Changes in the other categories of services
imports were small.  The October 2010 to October 2011 increase in exports
of services was $4.4 billion. The largest increases were
in royalties and license fees ($1.5 billion), travel ($1.1
billion), and other private services ($1.0 billion).
Within other private services, the largest increase was in
business, professional, and technical services.  The October 2010 to October 2011 increase in imports
of services was $2.0 billion. The largest increases were
in other private services ($1.0 billion), travel ($0.3
billion), and royalties and license fees ($0.3 billion).
Within other private services, the largest increase was in
business, professional, and technical services.  Goods and Services Moving Average  For the three months ending in October, exports of goods
and services averaged $179.3 billion, while imports of
goods and services averaged $223.6 billion, resulting in
an average trade deficit of $44.3 billion.  For the three
months ending in September, the average trade deficit was
$45.2 billion, reflecting average exports of $178.8
billion and average imports of $224.0 billion.  Selected Not Seasonally Adjusted Goods Details  The October figures show surpluses, in billions of
dollars, with Hong Kong $3.0 ($4.3 for September),

billion more than the $24.2 billion in September, while
October imports were $3.3 billion more than the $32.5
billion in September.  Revisions  Census Basis (not seasonally adjusted)  For September, exports of goods were virtually unrevised
and imports of goods were revised up $0.6 billion. Goods
carry-over in October was $0.1 billion (0.0 percent) for
exports and $1.6 billion (0.8 percent) for imports.  For
September, revised export carry-over was virtually zero.

(0.2 percent).  Balance of Payments Basis (seasonally adjusted)  For April 2011 through September 2011, exports and imports
of goods and services were revised to incorporate more
comprehensive and updated quarterly and monthly data.  For September, exports of goods were virtually unrevised,
and imports of goods were revised up $0.6 billion.
Exports of services were revised up $0.3 billion; upward
revisions in royalties and license fees and travel were
partly offset by a downward revision in other private
services.  Imports of services were revised up $0.7
billion, reflecting upward revisions in other private
services and travel.  SOURCE: U.S. Commerce Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
