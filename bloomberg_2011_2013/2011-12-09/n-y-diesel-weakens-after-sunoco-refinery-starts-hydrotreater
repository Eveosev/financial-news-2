New York diesel slipped to its lowest
level in 11 months after  Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  started a hydrotreater at
its Philadelphia refinery.  The refinery started the unit Dec. 7 after it was shut for
repairs to a compressor one day earlier, according to filings
with Philadelphia’s health department.  Diesel inventories in the U.S. East Coast, or Padd 1
region, rose 394,000 barrels last week to 25.9 million,
according to the Energy Department.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel in  New York Harbor 
declined 0.5 cent to 1.63 cents a gallon versus heating oil
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 3:37 p.m.
It’s the smallest gap since Jan. 5. Prompt delivery fell 2.23
cents to $2.9288 a gallon.  The discount for the same fuel in the U.S. Gulf Coast
narrowed 0.3 cent to 7.25 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
