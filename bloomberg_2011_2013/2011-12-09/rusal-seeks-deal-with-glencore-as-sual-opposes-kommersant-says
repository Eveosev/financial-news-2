United Co. Rusal’s (486)  board approved a
seven-to-10 year contract with Glencore International Plc in
November to sell half of its aluminum through a trader,
overriding the objections of a shareholder,  Kommersant  reported
today, citing people it didn’t identify.  Sual Partners, a company controlled by Victor Vekselberg
and Leonid Blavatnik that holds 15.8 percent of the aluminum
producer, tried to veto the deal, the Moscow-based newspaper
said. Oleg Deripaska’s En+ Group Ltd., which owns 47.4 percent
of Rusal, ignored Sual’s move in violation of a 2007 shareholder
agreement that if one party vetoes all others will follow,
according to the report.  Mikhail Prokhorov ’s Onexim Group, which holds 17 percent of
Rusal, voted against the Glencore deal in accordance with the
shareholders pact, Kommersant said.  A contract has not been signed yet, and the parties will
try to resolve the conflict according to internal procedures,
Kommersant said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
