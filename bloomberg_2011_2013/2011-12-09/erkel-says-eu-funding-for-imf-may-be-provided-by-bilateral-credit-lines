German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said
new European Union contributions to the  International Monetary
Fund  may take the form of bilateral credit lines.  “We are considering making funds available for the IMF as
bilateral credit lines to have an additional backstop for the
euro with the help of other countries that don’t belong to the
euro area,” she told reporters in Brussels today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
