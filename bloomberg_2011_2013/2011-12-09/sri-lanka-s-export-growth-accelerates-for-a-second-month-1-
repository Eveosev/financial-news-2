Sri Lanka ’s export growth accelerated
in September for the second straight month as demand for
garments, textiles and rubber products increased.  Overseas sales increased 20.4 percent to $854 million from
a year earlier, after advancing 19.1 percent in August, the
Central Bank of Sri Lanka said in a statement today.  The central bank on Nov. 16 left interest rates unchanged
for a tenth straight month to boost domestic demand as  Europe ’s
debt crisis and elevated U.S. unemployment hurt Asian exports. A
U.S. trade concession law aiming to promote growth in developing
nations, which came into effect Nov. 5, may help cushion the
impact of a slowing global economy on overseas sales.  Earnings from textiles and garment exports rose 13.7
percent in September from a year earlier, according to the
central bank statement. Overseas sales of rubber products
increased 37.3 percent.  President  Barack Obama  on Oct. 21 signed into law the
reauthorization of the Generalized System of Preferences, a
program that provides preferential duty-free entry for up to
4,800 products from 129 countries and territories including Sri
Lanka, the U.S. embassy in  Colombo  said last month. The law
remains effective through July 31, 2013.  Exports account for about a fifth of Sri Lanka’s $50
billion economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
