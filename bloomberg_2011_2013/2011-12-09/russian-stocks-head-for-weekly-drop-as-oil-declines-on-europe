Russian stocks tumbled, extending the
worst weekly decline since September, as protesters plan
demonstrations tomorrow against election results and falling oil
prices hurt the energy-led economy.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  declined 4.1 percent, the most since Nov.
21, to 1,396.28 by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow. The gauge
retreated 7.3 percent in the week, the most since Sept. 25.  OAO
GMK Norilsk Nickel ,  Russia ’s largest miner, fell 5.6 percent.
 OAO Sberbank , the biggest lender, declined 4.1 percent. The
dollar-denominated  RTS Index  tumbled 4.3 percent to 1,410.28.  Organizers expect more than 20,000 people to gather
tomorrow in central Moscow to protest alleged ballot-box
stuffing in Dec. 4 elections. City officials approved a rally
for 30,000 after first limiting the number to 300. Crude oil,
Russia’s main export earner, fell after euro-area countries
agreed on measures to ease the region’s crisis, while failing to
reach an accord with all European Union members.  “The market is only now starting to price in the return of
top-level political risk for the first time in 12 years,” said
 Kingsmill Bond , chief Russia strategist at Citigroup in an e-
mailed note today. “The metals and mining sector is most at
risk. We see risk to companies that are beneficiaries of the
current rentier system or controlled by oligarchs.”  OAO Severstal , the steelmaker controlled by billionaire
Alexey Mordashov, sank 4.3 percent to 385.90 rubles.  Vladimir Lisin ’s  OAO Novolipetsk Steel  dropped 3.3 percent to 67.73
rubles, while billionaire Victor Rashnikov’s  OAO Magnitogorsk
Iron & Steel  sank 2.5 percent.  Crude Retreats  Crude traded in  New York  dropped 2.8 percent this week, the
biggest weekly decline since Sept. 23, and traded at $98.14 a
barrel. Urals, Russia’s main export blend, dropped 0.3 percent
to $107.28 a barrel after a 1.7 percent decline yesterday.  OAO Rosneft, Russia’s biggest oil company, dropped 4.5
percent to 209.07 rubles.  OAO Lukoil , the largest private oil
producer, declined 4.7 percent to 1,611.2 rubles, its lowest
close since Oct. 6.  Emerging-market stocks fell even after European leaders at
the two-day summit in Brussels added 200 billion euros ($267
billion) to their crisis-fighting war chest and tightened anti-
deficit rules, seeking to lure the  European Central Bank  into
stepping up its rescue operations.  “We are seeing in Russia this morning a continuation of
the negative overnight trend in the U.S.,” Andrew Risk, equity
analyst at Aton LLC in Moscow, said by e-mail. “Investors seem
to be extremely cautious on what the outcome will be from the
European debt summit. The sharp movements seen this week seem to
confirm that underlying sentiment remains highly fragile.”  Cheapest BRIC  The Micex has lost 17 percent in 2011 and trades at 4.9
times estimated earnings. That compares with a 17 percent slide
for  Brazil ’s  Bovespa (IBOV)  index, which trades at 8.2 times estimated
earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  Shanghai
Composite Index (SHCOMP)  trades at 11 times estimated earnings, and the
 BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  has a ratio of 13.9.  The ruble depreciated 0.3 percent to 31.455 against the
dollar, its weakest level closing since Nov. 25.  Sberbank  fell
to 82.49 rubles.  VTB Group , the country’s second-biggest lender,
fell 5.8 percent to 6.298 kopeks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
