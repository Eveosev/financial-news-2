OAO Mechel (MTL)  gained for the first day
in four in New York after the company resumed output of coal at
two mines in Russia and as U.S.-traded steel producers,
including  United States Steel Corp. (X)  and ArcelorMittal, rose.  Output of coal resumed in full at the Lenin and New-
Olzherassk mines where work was halted earlier this week
following complaints about  work conditions  there to a government
safety watchdog,  Mechel (MTLR)  said in a statement today.  Mechel’s American depositary receipts rose 3.2 percent to
$10.02 in New York. The stock lost 17 percent in the previous
three sessions. Ordinary  shares  fell 1.7 percent to 312.20
rubles, or equivalent of $9.92, on the Micex in Moscow today,
before the company announced it resumed output.  “They have opened the mines and the stock gained,” Ilya Kravets, a research analyst at brokerage ED Capital in  New York ,
said via phone. “Today’s gains in U.S. markets also help it a
lot.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
