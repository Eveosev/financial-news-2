Michel Cicurel, the chairman of La
Compagnie Financiere Edmond de Rothschild, said in an interview
with  Le Figaro  that he will relinquish his position to pursue
other interests in September 2012.  Guy Grymberg, the chief executive officer of the private-
banking and fund-management group, will leave at the same time,
the newspaper cited Cicurel as saying.  Benjamin de Rothschild, a shareholder of Financiere Edmond
de Rothschild, said the company might welcome new investors,
though not large institutions, Le Figaro reported. A tie-up with
Rothschild & Cie isnâ€™t on the agenda, the newspaper cited him as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
