The  Czech Republic  needs to wait for
the final version of the European Unionâ€™s agreement on tackling
the financial crisis before deciding whether it will join the
accord, the  CTK  newswire reported, citing Premier Petr Necas.  EU members not using the euro will be able to decide
whether to join the agreement that should introduce stricter
fiscal rules for the countries inside the euro region, CTK cited
Necas as saying in Brussels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
