Chile’s peso fell as traders,
returning from a public holiday, priced in yesterday’s declines
in other emerging-market currencies and copper, the country’s
main export.  The peso weakened 0.4 percent to 509.95 per  U.S. dollar  at
1:27 p.m. in Santiago from 508.06 on Dec. 7. Chilean markets
were closed yesterday for Immaculate Conception Day.  Global stocks and commodities slumped yesterday as the
 European Central Bank  damped speculation it would boost
sovereign-debt purchases and regulators said the region’s
lenders need to raise more capital than previously estimated.
The  Bloomberg JPMorgan Latin America Currency Index  fell 0.8
percent yesterday, the most in two weeks.  “Yesterday was a very negative day for markets,” Ronald Volpi, head of spot currency trading at EuroAmerica Corredor de
Bolsa SA, said by telephone. “The peso should trade in a 508-
511 range while the market waits for the outcome of the meetings
in  Europe .”  The peso strengthened on Dec. 7, while most other Latin
American currencies weakened, after a report showed inflation of
0.3 percent in November, exceeding economists’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
