Puregold Price Club Inc. , the second-
largest Philippine operator of grocery stores and hypermarkets,
said will probably meet its profit goal this year after luring
more shoppers. The stock rose the most in a month.  “Things are looking up and based on the feedback of our
store managers, consumer traffic is better than last year and
they expect this to pick up some more as people get their
bonuses,” Senior Vice President Aida de Guzman said by phone
today.  Puregold , which has 89 outlets, is “on track to
achieving our targets” and will open its 100th store on Dec.
19, she said.  Manila-based  Puregold  President Leonardo Dayao on Oct. 5
forecast  net income  of 1.5 billion pesos to 1.6 billion pesos
($36.7 million) for this year. The company, which posted a 750
million peso profit in 2010, held an initial public offering
earlier this year to pay debt and fund new stores, which Dayao
said have grabbed market share prices lower than rivals’.  “The target is fairly optimistic and the key to reaching
is their accelerated store expansion,” said Jomar Lacson, an
analyst at Manila-based stock brokerage Campos Lanuza & Co. who
 recommends  buying the shares. Puregold’s profit may reach 1.65
billion pesos this year, he said.  The company posted a 1.08 billion peso nine-month net
income this year, almost three times its 378 million peso profit
in the same period a year earlier. The company said on Sept. 30
that it will open 38 stores this year. The fourth quarter
accounts for 30 percent of sales and earnings, de Guzman said
today.  Puregold  shares  rose 6.5 percent to 16.72 pesos at the
close of trading in Manila, the most since Nov. 8. It’s the
fourth-biggest percentage increase among shares that traded in
Manila today. The benchmark Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell
0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
