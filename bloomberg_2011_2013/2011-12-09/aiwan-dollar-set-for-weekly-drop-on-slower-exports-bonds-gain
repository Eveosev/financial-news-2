Taiwan’s dollar declined this week
and  government bonds  gained after exports rose the least in more
than two years amid a contraction in shipments to Europe.  Overseas sales increased 1.3 percent in November from a
year earlier, compared with an 11.7 percent gain the previous
month, the  finance ministry  reported yesterday. Goods sent to
Europe slid 21.9 percent. Taiwan’s currency has lost 4.8 percent
this half as the euro-area debt crisis dimmed the island’s
export outlook.  “Export growth dropped very rapidly,” said Eric Hsing, a
fixed-income trader at First Securities Inc. in Taipei. “Money
will flow to the U.S. dollar.”  Taiwan’s dollar dropped 0.3 percent this week to NT$30.239
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The
currency fell 0.2 percent today. The benchmark Taiex  index (TWSE)  of
stocks lost 3.5 percent this week.  Government bonds advanced this week as local investors
sought safety in fixed-income securities, according to Hsing.  “The  bond market  will go bullish for a while,” he said.  The yield on the 2 percent bonds due July 2016 slipped one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, today and this week to
0.985 percent, according to Gretai Securities Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
