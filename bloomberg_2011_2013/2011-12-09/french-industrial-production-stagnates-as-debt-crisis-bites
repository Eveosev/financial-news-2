French industrial production was
unchanged in October after falling more than originally
estimated in September as  Europe ’s debt crisis hurt confidence
and raised concern that the region’s expansion is stalling.  Output  declined a revised 2.1 percent in September instead
of the 1.7 percent originally estimated, national statistics
office Insee in Paris said in an e-mailed statement today.
Economists had forecast a 0.2 percent drop for October,
according to the median of 16 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey. Manufacturing production was also unchanged in October.  France’s economy, Europe’s second largest, is showing
increasing signs of a slowdown as global demand falters and
European leaders struggle to contain the turmoil. Business
confidence fell to a two-year low in November, suggesting the
economy won’t expand in the fourth quarter, the Bank of  France 
said yesterday.  The European Central Bank yesterday cut its growth forecast
for the euro region to 0.3 percent for 2012 from 1.3 percent in
September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
