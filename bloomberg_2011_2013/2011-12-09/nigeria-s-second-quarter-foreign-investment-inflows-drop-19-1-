Foreign direct investment in  Nigeria ,
 Africa ’s top oil producer, declined 19 percent from the previous
three months to $1.53 billion in the second quarter, the central
bank said.  Foreign-currency inflows fell 15 percent to $23 billion
during the period, the Abuja-based  Central Bank of Nigeria  said
on its  website  yesterday. Foreign direct investment rose 2
percent from a year earlier while foreign exchange inflows
increased 32 percent, it said.  The decline “may be linked to the Euro debt crisis which
has continued to adversely affect major international financial
centers and hence financial flows to emerging and developing
countries,” the central bank said.  Nigeria’s current-account surplus almost doubled to $8.14
billion in the second quarter from the first, indicating “a
significant improvement in the balance of trade position,” the
central bank said. The  trade surplus  climbed to $12.5 billion
from $8.75 billion in the first quarter.  Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation with more than 160
million people, aims to create an environment conducive to
attract foreign direct investment, Trade and Investment Minister
Olusegun Aganga said on Dec. 6.  Nigeria’s foreign reserves fell to $31.9 billion in the
second quarter from $33.2 billion a quarter earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
