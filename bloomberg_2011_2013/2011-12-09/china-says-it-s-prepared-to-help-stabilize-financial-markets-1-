China  is ready to work with other
countries to help stabilize international financial markets and
promote growth, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said in
Beijing today.  China notes that “European countries have put forward
important proposals to deal with the debt crisis,” Hong told a
daily briefing. He said the European Union has the “wisdom and
capacity” to overcome the debt crisis.  “We are ready to work with the international community to
stabilize international financial markets and promote recovery
and growth,” Hong said.  At a two-day summit in Brussels, European leaders  outlined
a “fiscal compact” to prevent future debt runups, accelerated
the start of a planned 500 billion-euro ($666 billion) rescue
fund and watered down bondholder loss-sharing provisions.  After overnight negotiations, the leaders added 200 billion
euros to their crisis-fighting war chest and tightened anti-
deficit rules, seeking to lure the  European Central Bank  into
stepping up its rescue operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
