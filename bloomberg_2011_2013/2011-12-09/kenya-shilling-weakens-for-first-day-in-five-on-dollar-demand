Kenya ’s shilling weakened for the
first day in five on increased dollar demand by oil importers.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy declined as
much as 0.4 percent and traded 0.1 percent lower at 89.40 per
dollar at 1:24 p.m. in Nairobi, paring its advance this week to
0.5 percent.  “The shilling has weakened due to increased dollar demand
by oil importers,” John Muli, a dealer at Nairobi-based African
Banking Corp., said in a phone interview today.  Uganda’s currency fell for the first day in four on higher
interbank dollar demand, weakening 0.3 percent to 2,468 per
dollar. The shilling was headed for a weekly appreciation of 2.3
percent.  “The demand for the dollars came from the  interbank
market ,” Faisal Bukenya, the head of  currency trading  at
 Barclays Bank  of Uganda Ltd., said by phone from Kampala. “One
of the banks was in the market seeking the dollar and the amount
was substantial,” he said, without giving further details.  Tanzania’s money market is closed for a public holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
