The  New Zealand  and Australian
dollars reached the lowest level this month against their U.S.
counterpart as European leaders failed to reach a unanimous
accord to resolve the region’s sovereign-debt crisis.  New Zealand’s currency, nicknamed the kiwi, and Australia’s
dollar both fell for the week against the greenback as U.K.
Prime Minister  David Cameron  said there was “fundamental
disagreement” in European Union talks in Brussels. The losses
were tempered as global stocks  rallied (MXWO)  from the lowest levels in
more than a week.  “I don’t think the changes that have been announced are
going to significantly change the trajectory of the euro zone’s
problems,” said  Joseph Capurso , a currency strategist at
 Commonwealth Bank of Australia  in Sydney. “They still got big
stress in the banking system. Any boost to the euro, the Aussie
or the kiwi is going to be short-lived.”  New Zealand’s currency was little changed at 77.33 U.S.
cents at 1:26 p.m. New York time, after sliding to as low as
76.37, the weakest since Nov. 30. It fell 0.5 percent for the
week. The kiwi lost 1 percent on the week to 60 yen. It was
little changed today.  Australia ’s dollar fell as much as 1.2 percent today to
$1.0048, also the weakest level since Nov. 30, before trading at
$1.0197, up 0.3 percent. It slipped 0.2 percent this week. The
Aussie ended the day up 0.3 percent to 79.15 yen after falling
as much as 1.1 percent. It lost 0.7 percent versus the yen on
the week.  The MSCI World Index of stocks tumbled as much as 0.6
percent to the lowest level since Nov. 30 before rebounding to
gain 1 percent.  Balance of Power  EU leaders holding all-night talks in Brussels agreed to
channel as much as 200 billion euros ($267 billion) to the
 International Monetary Fund  and bowed to European Central Bank
demands for a tightening of anti-deficit rules.  In a clash that may reshape  Europe ’s balance of power, the
17 euro users took the novel approach of enshrining the debt
rules in a new treaty that leaves out the U.K. instead of
amending EU agreements that date back to the 1950s. Nine of the
10 non-euro members indicated they may follow suit after
consulting with their parliaments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
