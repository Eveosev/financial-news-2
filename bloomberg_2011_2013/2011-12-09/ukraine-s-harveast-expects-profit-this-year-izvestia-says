HarvEast Holding, a Ukrainian
agricultural company, will have 60 million hryvnia ($7.5
million) to 70 million hryvnia in profit this year,
 Ekonomicheskie Izvestia  reported, citing Dmytro Skornyakov,
deputy chief executive officer.  HarvEast, formed by Rinat Akhmetov and Vadim Novinsky, had
a loss in 2010, the newspaper said.  The company plans to improve efficiency and will invest $10
million in agricultural machines in the first half of next year,
the newspaper said. HarvEast will keep the amount of land it
uses for production unchanged, Izvestia added.  To contact the reporters on this story:
