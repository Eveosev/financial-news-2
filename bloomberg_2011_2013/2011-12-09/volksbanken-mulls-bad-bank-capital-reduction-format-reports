Oesterreichische Volksbanken AG (VBPS) , the
Austrian lender which has yet to pay interest on 1 billion euros
($1.3 billion) of state aid received in 2009, is considering
establishing a so-called bad bank,  Format  magazine reported,
without saying where it got the information.  The lender, majority-owned by a group of 62 regional
cooperative banks, wants Austria to carry the costs of this bad
bank via capital injections and guarantees, according to the
report. Volksbanken would transfer everything that isn’t part of
its “core business” -- from “ailing bonds to defunct real-
estate loans” -- into the bad bank, Format said.  Volksbanken’s also wants to reduce its capital by 60
percent to wipe out losses, the Vienna-based magazine said. This
would mean than the state would need to write down 600 million
euros of the injected aid, Format said. The plan will be
presented to the  Finance Ministry  next week, according to the
report.  Finance Minister Maria Fekter is demanding that the
regional cooperative banks and  DZ Bank  give Volksbanken extra
capital if they want state assistance, Format said.  The regional cooperative banks own 61 percent of
Volksbanken. Germany’s  DZ Bank  owns 23 percent, a unit of  Munich
Re (MUV2)  owns 9 percent and  Raiffeisen Zentralbank Oesterreich AG  owns
6 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
