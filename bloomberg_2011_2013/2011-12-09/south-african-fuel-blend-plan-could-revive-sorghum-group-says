South Africa ’s proposed mandatory
blending of biofuels with gasoline and diesel may signal the
start of a biofuels industry and boost sorghum output sixfold,
an economist at the farmers’ body Grain SA said.  The government’s September release of draft blending rules
may be “an early indication of a possible economic revival that
is due for the sorghum industry,” Wessel Lemmer said in the
Bothaville-based group’s monthly magazine. Blending could boost
sorghum output to 950,000 metric tons by 2020, he said.  The nation produced 155,000 tons in the last season,
according to the Crop Estimates Committee. The average annual
crop was 226,000 tons in the five years to 2006, according to a
 report  on the National Agricultural Marketing Council website.  “The successful development of the bio-ethanol industry,
including the benefits for South Africa, may at last be
underway,” Lemmer said.  A 2007 government proposal to establish a commercial
biofuels industry was insufficient to attract investments.  Sasol
Ltd. (SOL) , South Africa’s largest fuel supplier, Ethanol Africa Ltd.
and National Biofuels Group Ltd. canceled or delayed projects.  South Africa could introduce mandatory blending of as much
as 10 percent “without compromising food security in terms of
food availability,” he said. Prices will rise, he said. Sorghum
is used to produce food and beverages, including traditional
African beer.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  BP Plc (BP/)  and Sasol are among the
largest fuel producers in the country.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
