Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  said it reached
agreement with the Pentagon to build as many as 30 F-35 Joint
Strike Fighter jets in the fifth production lot valued at as
much as $4 billion.  The final negotiations on the price of the aircraft and
other terms are still under negotiation, company spokesman
Joseph LaMarca said in a phone interview.  Earlier today, the Pentagon announced that it had awarded a
$4 billion order for 30 F-35 jets to the Bethesda, Maryland-
based company. The Pentagon statement said the order included 21
Air Force models, six Navy versions and three Marine Corps
models of the airplane.  The agreement sets the maximum amount the Pentagon may
spend on the production lot and the terms may change until a so-
called definitized contract next year, Lockheed spokesman
Michael Rein said in an e-mail.  The announcement “is an important first step in paving the
way for the full contract negotiations,” Rein said.  Lockheed and the Pentagon agreed on an undefinitized
contract action, said Joe DellaVedova, spokesman for the F-35
program office. The accord will allow Lockheed to continue
building advanced parts for the next lot of F-35 jets, he said
in a phone interview.  Negotiations on the final terms of the fifth lot are
continuing and are expected to be completed in early 2012,
DellaVedova said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
