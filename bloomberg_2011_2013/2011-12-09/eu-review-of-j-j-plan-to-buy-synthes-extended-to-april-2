European Union regulators extended
their antitrust review of  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) ’s plan to buy
 Synthes Inc. (SYST)  in a deal valued at about $20.6 billion.  The extension in the deadline by 10 working days to April 2
was requested by regulators with the companies’ agreement, said
Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for the European Commission.  J&J, the world’s second-largest seller of health products,
agreed in April to buy Synthes, a maker of medical tools to
treat damaged bones, in the biggest purchase in the New
Brunswick, New Jersey-based company’s 125-year history.  The Brussels-based regulator opened an expanded
probe last month into the deal, which would make J&J the leader
in the $5.5 billion market for devices used to treat trauma
victims. The EU said its initial investigation showed that the
transaction may trigger an increase in prices.  West Chester , Pennsylvania-based Synthes declined to
comment, said spokesman Gilgian Eisner in an e-mail today. J&J
didn’t immediately respond to calls and an e-mail seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
