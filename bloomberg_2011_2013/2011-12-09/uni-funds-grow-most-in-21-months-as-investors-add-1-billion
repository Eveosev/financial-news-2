Investors added about $1 billion to
U.S. municipal-bond mutual funds in the week that ended Dec. 7,
the most since March 2010, as 10-year benchmark yields fell to
the lowest since September.  The funds have attracted about $3 billion since mid-
October, according to Lipper US Fund Flows data. Yields on top-
rated 10-year municipals fell to  2.005  yesterday, from a two-
month high of about 2.58 percent on Oct. 13, according to
Bloomberg Valuation data. Yesterday’s benchmark tax-free yield
was just above the 2.003 percent interest rate on Sept. 23, the
lowest since the index began in January 2009.  Investors are adding cash to municipal funds to tap into
the rally in the $3.7 trillion market and to boost assets they
deem relatively safe before month-end, said Matt Fabian,
managing director of Concord, Massachusetts-based Municipal
Market Advisors, in a telephone interview.  “It’s probably partly the rally and partly just
allocations into year-end, getting portfolios ready for year-end
to show a larger allocation of fixed income,” Fabian said.  Net additions in the past couple of months are a reversal
from earlier in the year. Investors pulled more than $30 billion
out of the funds from November 2010 to June as lingering strains
from the recession fueled speculation that municipal defaults
would jump.  In contrast with the decline in 10-year yields,  interest
rates  on top-rated tax-exempts maturing in 30 years increased in
the past two months to  3.85 percent  yesterday, according to
Bloomberg data. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The yield on the longer-maturity index was  185 basis points 
above that on the 10-year gauge yesterday, the widest gap since
at least January 2001, when the Bloomberg Valuation data began.  To contact the reporter on this story:
