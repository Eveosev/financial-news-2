The Australian and New Zealand
dollars fell to one-week lows on speculation a European summit
will fail to push the region’s debt crisis toward a resolution,
damping demand for higher-yielding assets.  The so-called Aussie and kiwi headed for weekly declines
after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said he
hadn’t signaled stepping up bond purchases to spur growth.
European leaders battled into the night at the summit to halt
two years of debt-driven turmoil in financial markets and dispel
concerns the euro is on the brink of unraveling.  “The market continually sets itself up for disappointment
from these summits,” said Derek Mumford, a Sydney-based
director at Rochford Capital, a currency-risk management firm.
“With the Aussie dollar, we see anything over $1.0250 up to
$1.04 as selling opportunities.”  The Australian dollar declined 0.4 percent to $1.0127 as of
3:13 p.m. in Sydney, after touching $1.0091, the lowest since
Nov. 30. It’s poised for a 0.9 percent drop this week. The
Aussie fell 0.4 percent to 78.65 yen.  New Zealand ’s currency retreated 0.6 percent to 76.81 U.S.
cents, after sliding to as low as 76.60, also the weakest since
Nov. 30. The kiwi was set for a 1.2 percent weekly loss. It slid
0.6 percent to 59.68 yen.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of stocks tumbled as much as
2.3 percent.  ECB Bond Purchases  The ECB’s Draghi said yesterday he was “kind of
surprised” by a view that took hold in markets last week that
the central bank would rapidly supplement its 207 billion-euro
($276 billion) bond-buying operations in response to a summit
announcement of steps toward a closer fiscal union. German
 Chancellor Angela Merkel  called the 15th summit in 23 months
part of a “step-by-step” solution to the crisis.  European Union leaders are struggling to find consensus on
changes aimed at stopping the debt crisis as French President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  said the talks were “extremely difficult” and
the U.K. made a Treaty including all 27 members impossible.  Australia ’s government bonds advanced, with  yields  on 10-
year debt declining 9 basis points to 3.83 percent. The rate was
poised for the lowest closing level since at least September
1992, when Bloomberg began compiling data. Three-year bond
yields declined five basis points to 3.07 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
