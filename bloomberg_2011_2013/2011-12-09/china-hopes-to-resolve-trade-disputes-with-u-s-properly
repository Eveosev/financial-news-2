China  hopes to resolve its
differences with the U.S. properly, a Foreign Ministry spokesman
said in response to a question about a trade dispute over
poultry.  “China-U.S. trade relations are an important part of the
bilateral relationship,” spokesman Hong Lei said at a briefing
today in Beijing. “We hope the two sides can properly solve
their differences and disputes.”  Hong was asked for China’s comments on a trade dispute that
U.S. Trade Representative Ronald Kirk has taken to the  World
Trade Organization . Kirk asked the WTO to set up a panel to seek
a settlement and is “serious about holding China accountable to
its WTO commitments,” he said in an e-mail  statement  yesterday.  China set a duty of as much as 105.4 percent last year on
U.S. broiler-chicken products. About 300,000 workers and farmers
have been hurt by China’s actions, Kirk said in a Sept. 21 news
conference.  China said in September its duties on American poultry are
“in line” with WTO rules after the U.S. filed a complaint with
the trade arbiter about the taxes, according to a  statement  from
the Ministry of Commerce. China imposed the duties in August and
September 2010, claiming U.S. products were being sold in China
at less than market value.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
