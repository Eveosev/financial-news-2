Neuberger Berman Group LLC, the New
York investment firm that bought itself out of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. in 2009, appointed Eli M. Salzmann manager of its
$1.95 billion Partners Fund after it trailed 88 percent of
rivals over the past year.  Salzmann, 47, joined the firm in January and will continue
to run the Large Cap Value Fund, which opened in March, the
company said today in a statement. He replaces S. Basu Mullick,
who is “pursuing other opportunities,” the company said in the
statement.  The Partners Fund, which invests in mid- to-large-sized
companies seen as undervalued when measured by earnings or other
financial metrics, lost 8.1 percent in the past year.  Neuberger Berman also said it had appointed Michael C.
Greene, 52, to manage its $71 million Regency Fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
