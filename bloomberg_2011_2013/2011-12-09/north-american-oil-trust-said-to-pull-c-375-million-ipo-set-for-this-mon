North American Oil Trust withdrew
plans to raise about C$375 million ($368 million) in an initial
public offering, according to two people with knowledge of the
sale.  The IPO was pulled due to market conditions, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the details aren’t
public.  North American Oil Trust had planned to sell units this
month for C$10 each to buy oil properties in  North Dakota , the
Calgary-based trust said in a Nov. 7 filing with Canadian
regulators.  The company was established to buy and develop oil-weighted
reserves and production in the U.S. while providing monthly cash
payouts to investors, the filing said. The company planned to
use the proceeds to buy North Dakota oil properties in the
Williston Basin for $400 million.  Companies have raised $2.44 billion in initial offerings in
 Canada  this year, less than half the amount from the same period
a year ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  TD Securities, RBC Dominion Securities and CIBC World
Markets were leading the sale.  A telephone message left with Chief Financial Officer Peter
Hanrahan wasn’t immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
