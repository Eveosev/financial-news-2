Peru ’s dollar bonds fell, pushing up
yields the most in a week, as European leaders’ plan for closer
fiscal unity failed to allay concern Italy and Spain may succumb
to the region’s debt crisis.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 6.55 percent dollar-
denominated bond due March 2037 climbed two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 4.87 percent at 1:38 p.m. in New York,
the biggest gain since Nov. 29. The bond’s price fell 0.37 cent
to 124.24 cents per dollar.  European leaders holding all-night talks in Brussels added
200 billion euros ($267 billion) to their crisis-fighting
capacity and toughened anti-deficit rules. Though ECB President
 Mario Draghi  hailed the agreement, he didn’t signal the bank
will expand purchases of Italian and Spanish bonds, which
disappointed investors, said  Enrique Alvarez , head of Latin
America fixed-income research at IdeaGlobal in New York.  “The Europeans went the route of fiscal unity but they did
little as to clarify how the more stricken credits are going to
finance in the early part of 2012,” Alvarez said. “That
creates a risk aversion factor.”  The sol was little changed at 2.6950 per  U.S. dollar ,
compared with 2.6955 on Dec. 7, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s
local unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
