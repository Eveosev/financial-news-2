China ’s yuan declined this week on
speculation policy makers will slow currency appreciation as
inflation cooled to the slowest pace in 14 months.  Consumer prices  rose 4.2 percent in November from a year
earlier after increasing 5.5 percent the previous month, the
National Bureau of Statistics said today. Risks of yuan
depreciation are rising in the short term, triggered by “large-
scale” capital outflows, Zhang Monan, a researcher at the State
Information Center, wrote in a commentary in the China
Securities Journal today.  “Easing inflation implies there’ll be less room for yuan
appreciation,” said Edmond Law, deputy head of foreign exchange
at BWC Capital Markets in  Hong Kong . “Officials will now shift
their focus to protecting economic growth amid the increasingly
uncertain global outlook. The inflation data confirms further
monetary easing is likely.”  The yuan fell 0.1 percent this week to close at 6.3647 per
dollar in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. It dropped 0.04 percent today. The People’s Bank
of China set the daily fixing 0.05 percent lower at 6.3352 per
dollar, the weakest level since Dec. 1. The currency is allowed
to fluctuate as much as 0.5 percent on either side of the  fixing .  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan gained 0.3 percent
this week and 0.08 percent today to 6.3625 per dollar. Twelve-
month non-deliverable forwards dropped 0.5 percent this week and
0.2 percent today to 6.4130, a 0.8 percent discount to the
onshore spot rate.  No country can have one-way appreciation of its currency,
the China Securities Journal reported today, citing former
People’s Bank of China Deputy Governor  Wu Xiaoling .  -- Editors: Ven Ram, Simon Harvey  To contact the reporter on this story:
