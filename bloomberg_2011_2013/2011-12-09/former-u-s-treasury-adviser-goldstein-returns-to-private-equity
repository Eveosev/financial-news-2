Jeffrey Goldstein , a former adviser
to Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  on domestic finance,
will rejoin Hellman & Friedman LLC as a managing director.  Goldstein was the Under Secretary of the Treasury for
Domestic Finance from 2009 to July of this year. He advised
Geithner on regulatory policies related to the U.S. banking and
housing systems, as well as on the administration’s bailout
investments in banks and automobile companies, the firm said in
a Dec. 8 statement.  Goldstein will work in New York and deal with the firm’s
investors in the financial-services industry, the company said.  “Financial services has always been a key area of focus
for us and Jeffrey brings a wealth of experience and knowledge
of the sector,” Philip Hammarskjold, the firm’s chief executive
officer, said in the statement.  Hellman & Friedman, which has offices in  San Francisco , New
York and London, invests in a variety of industries, including
Internet technology and financial services, in the U.S. and
Europe. The firm earlier this year partnered with  Carlyle Group 
to buy Pharmaceutical Product Development Inc. for $3.9 billion,
the third-largest leveraged buyout of the year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Goldstein joined the World Bank in 1999 and became its
chief financial officer before joining Hellman & Friedman the
first time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
