VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) , the Russian mobile-
phone operator with more than 200 million customers worldwide,
said it will decide next month on whether to buy control of
Euroset Holding NV, operator of  Russia ’s biggest mobile-phone
retailer.  Vimplecom already owns a 49.9 percent stake in Euroset and
has yet to decide on whether to buy another 25 percent, Elena Prokhorova, VimpelCom’s Moscow-based spokeswoman, said today in
a telephone interview. Vimpelcom’s exclusive right to buy the 25
percent stake in Euroset expires Jan. 23, she said.  Billionaire  Alexander Mamut , who owns the rest of Euroset,
is seeking to sell his 50.1 percent stake, Kommersant newspaper
reported yesterday, citing people it didn’t identify. Euroset’s
Moscow-based public relations manager Alexandra Japrintseva said
today the company has no comment on the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
