Banco do Brasil SA (BBAS3) , Latin American
biggest bank by assets, doesn’t need to increase its capital to
carry out its 2012 business plan, the bank’s chairman said.
Shares reversed earlier losses.  “We see no need to use state banks as we did in 2008,”
said Nelson Barbosa, 42, who is also deputy finance minister, in
an interview in Brasilia today.  Brazil’s President Dilma Rousseff is seeking to revamp the
economy, which shrank in the third quarter from the previous
three months, by reducing  interest rates , cutting taxes and
loosening banking capital requirements as her predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva did during the 2008 crisis. The Treasury
has lent 30 billion reais ($16.6 billion) to the state
development bank, known as the BNDES, this year and has approval
to provide 25 billion reais more.  O Globo  said Dec. 5 that  Brazil ’s government was
considering increasing the capital of Banco do Brasil so it
could continue offering credit. The Rio de Janeiro-based
newspaper didn’t say where it obtained the information. Banco do
Brasil said Dec. 6 it hasn’t received any request from its
controlling shareholder to study a possible capital increase,
according to a regulatory filing.  Banco do Brasil rose 2.2 percent to 24.20 reais in Sao
Paulo trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
