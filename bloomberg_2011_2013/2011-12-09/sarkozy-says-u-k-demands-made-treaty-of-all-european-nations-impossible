French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  said
British Prime Minister  David Cameron  made “unacceptable”
demands on leaders regarding a reform of the Treaty.  “We want to move very fast now,” Sarkozy said at a
briefing after the summit of European Union leaders in Brussels.
Nations are aiming to reach an agreement by March, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
