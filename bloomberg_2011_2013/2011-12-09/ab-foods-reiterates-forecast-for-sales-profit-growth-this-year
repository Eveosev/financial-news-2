Associated British Foods Plc (ABF) , the
owner of the Primark discount-clothing chain and the Silver
Spoon sugar brand, reiterated its forecast that sales and profit
will increase this fiscal year as commodity costs ease.  The anticipated improvement in so-called adjusted operating
profit will be weighted toward the second half, Chairman Charles Sinclair said in a statement released at the time of today’s
annual general meeting. Business in the first two months of the
financial year was “in line with our expectations,” he said.  Sugar production in the northern hemisphere has made a
“good start,” the company said. AB Foods makes sugar in
countries including  China ,  Spain  and the U.K., and expects
higher prices to be a benefit in the coming year. The sugar unit
represented about 33 percent of operating income last year.
Sugar prices have increased 15 percent in the last year.  Food and clothing producers have been hurt by soaring costs
of commodities including wheat, oil and cotton. AB Foods said in
the statement that it doesn’t expect to see the effects of
“subsiding” costs “immediately, and in the case of Primark,
not until the beginning of the new calendar year.”  The shares traded down 1 penny at 1,082 pence as of 12 p.m.  AB Foods, which controls Illovo Sugar Ltd., the largest
maker of the commodity in  Africa , reported adjusted operating
profit of 920 million pounds ($1.45 billion) in the year ended
Sept. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
