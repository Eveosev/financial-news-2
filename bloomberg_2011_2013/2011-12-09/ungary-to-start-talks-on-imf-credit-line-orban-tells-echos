Hungary will start talks with the
International Monetary Fund “in the very next few days” about
a discretionary credit line, Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  said in
an interview with French daily  Les Echos .  Orban said $4 billion to $5 billion will be sufficient
because Hungary is still able to refinance in the market, the
newspaper  reported  on its website.  The government will probably have to “strongly” reduce
its outlook for growth in 2012 from a September forecast for 1.5
percent, as the withdrawal by European banks of capital from
Hungary and a slowing German economy weigh on business, Orban
said, according to Les Echos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
