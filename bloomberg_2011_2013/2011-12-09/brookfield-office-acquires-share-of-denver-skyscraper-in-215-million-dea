A group led by  Brookfield Office
Properties Inc. (BPO)  bought Denver’s second-tallest building for $215
million, as it seeks to benefit from expiring leases.  Brookfield will own a 51 percent stake in 1801 California
St., a 54-story 1.4 million-square-foot (130,000-square-meter)
skyscraper, and manage the property on behalf of the investment
group, the New York-based company said today in a statement
distributed by Marketwire. The seller is PSEG Energy Holdings,
Brookfield said.  “The Denver market has demonstrated strong fundamentals
with positive absorption and job growth over the past 18
months,” Dennis Friedrich, Brookfield’s president and chief
investment officer, said in the statement. The tower “fits our
strategy of owning premier assets in the best-located areas
within our operating markets.”  The company said it plans to make improvements to the
building, formerly known as Qwest Tower. Leases on 80 percent
its space expire by July. Tenants include CenturyLink Inc.,
Patton Boggs LLP and MWH Americas Inc., Brookfield said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
