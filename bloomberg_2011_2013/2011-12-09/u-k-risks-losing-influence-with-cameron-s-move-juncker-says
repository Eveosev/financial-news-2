The U.K. risks “losing influence”
in the European Union through its decision to remain outside a
pact to tighten budget rules, Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-
Claude Juncker said.  “It’s not good for us to have Britain stepping away from
the mainstream we’ve developed, but it’s not good for Britain
either, because if Britain wants to play a central role in
 Europe , Britain has to be a part of all the common policies we
are developing,” Juncker told reporters after a summit of EU
leaders in Brussels today. “A country which is not part of the
central piece of policy-making is losing influence.”  British Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s decision is “not
good for his country and not good for Europe,” Juncker said.
“The U.K. is a big country, but long-term it’s too small to
continue a policy of isolation,” he said.  “Our British colleagues are always arguing when touching
upon European matters that these matters have to be decided upon
in a pro-British, thus national sense, whereas on the continent,
at least some of us, are continuing to share the idea that
European decisions have to be in the best interest of our
nations and in the best interest of our continent,” Juncker
said. “I don’t think that if a decision is only in the best
interest of a specific country that this decision will be also
in the best interest of the European Union,” he said.  “I don’t think it’s wise or intelligent that some British
politicians are proceeding on a day-by-day basis to a real kind
of Europe-bashing,” Juncker said. “That’s not loyal.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
