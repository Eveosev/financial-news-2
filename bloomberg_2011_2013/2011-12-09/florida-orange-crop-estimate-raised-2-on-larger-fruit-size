Florida ’s orange crop will be 2
percent larger than the October forecast, exceeding analysts’
estimates, because of bigger fruit size, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said.  The state, the world’s second-biggest grower, will produce
150 million boxes in the harvest that began in October and runs
into July, up from the previous projection of 147 million, the
USDA said today in a report. The average estimate of six
analysts and traders in a Bloomberg News survey was for 147.75
million. The orange crop totaled 140.3 million boxes last year.  The forecast was raised because of “the excellent fruit
size,” Judy Ganes-Chase, the president of J. Ganes Consulting
in Katona, New York, said in an e-mail before the report.  Orange juice  gained 5.5 percent this year before today,
heading for the third straight annual advance. Yesterday, the
January contract dropped 1.1 percent to $1.725 a pound on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York, falling for a third straight day.  “Florida has had good weather so far this year with
showers most days and warm temperatures,” favoring fruit
development,  Jack Scoville , a vice president at Price Futures
Group in Chicago, said in an e-mailed report.  Yields will average 1.60 gallons per box, up from 1.59
gallons last year, the USDA said. A box weighs about 90 pounds,
or 41 kilograms.  Brazil is the world’s biggest producer of oranges.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
