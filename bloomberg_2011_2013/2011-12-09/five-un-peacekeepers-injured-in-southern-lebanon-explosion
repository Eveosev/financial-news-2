At least five  United Nations 
peacekeepers were injured in an explosion in southern Lebanon,
said Andrea Tenenti, deputy spokesman for the UN unit.  The blast targeted the patrol of the  United Nations Interim
Force in Lebanon  and took place at about 9:30 a.m. on the
outskirts of the port city of Tyre, Tenenti said in a statement
today. The five soldiers were evacuated for treatment, and UN
and Lebanese investigators are working at the scene, he said.  Lebanese Prime Minister  Najib Mikati  condemned the attack.
“These crimes don’t only target the international forces but
also the security, stability and security of all Lebanese,” he
said in an e-mailed statement.  Unifil’s 12,000 soldiers and civilian police officers are
monitoring a cease-fire between  Israel  and the Shiite Muslim
Hezbollah movement that followed a monthlong conflict along the
Israeli-Lebanese border in 2006. UN soldiers have been in
southern Lebanon since 1978, when  Unifil  was created to verify
an Israeli withdrawal from the south after an invasion that
year. Israel invaded Lebanon again in 1982 and withdrew in 2000.
The UN force was enlarged after the 2006 conflict.  Six soldiers were injured in a July 26 attack on the UN
forces in a convoy near the city of Sidon, and six Italian
peacekeepers were injured in a May 27 bombing in southern
Lebanon. In June 2007, a bomb attack on the Spanish battalion in
the UN mission killed six peacekeepers. No one has taken
responsibility for the deaths.  To contact the reporter on this story:
