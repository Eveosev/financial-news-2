Copper extended a weekly decline as
industrial production in the world’s largest commodity consumer
slowed to the lowest level in more than two years.  Three-month delivery copper fell as much as 0.3 percent to
$7,685 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, and traded at
$7,695 by 3:05 p.m. Shanghai time. The contract lost 2.5 percent
this week.  China ’s industrial production growth rose 12.4 percent in
November from a year earlier, the slowest since August 2009 and
fell short of a median forecast of 12.6 percent by a Bloomberg
News survey of 34 economists.  “Slowing industrial output indicated that downstream
demand is being threatened, and this is certainly a concern,”
Liang Lijuan, an analyst at Cofco Futures Co., said by phone
from Beijing.  Copper for February delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange closed 1.4 percent lower at 57,070 ($8,964) a ton. The
March-delivery contract on the Comex in  New York  declined 0.2
percent to $3.4925 a pound.  Consumer prices in China rose 4.2 percent from a year
earlier in November, the slowest pace in 14 months, data from
the National Bureau of Statistics showed today. The number was
lower than all estimates in a Bloomberg News survey of 35
economists that had a median forecast of 4.5 percent, and fell
from a 5.5 percent year-on-year growth in October.  “Policy focus is shifting from ‘managing inflation’ to
’support growth’ and ’preventing financial risks’,” said
economists at  Barclays Capital  led by Chang Jian in a research
report today.  On the LME, aluminum was unchanged at $2,065 a ton. Lead
fell 0.2 percent to $2,099 a ton, and nickel dropped 0.8 percent
to $18,150 a ton. Zinc rose 0.3 percent to $1,990 a ton, and tin
gained 0.3 percent to $20,200 a ton.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
