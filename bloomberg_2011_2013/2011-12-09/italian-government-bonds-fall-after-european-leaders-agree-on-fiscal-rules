Italian government bonds fell after
European leaders agreed to tighten budget rules and boost their
crisis-fighting toolkit at a meeting in Brussels.  The decline pushed the 10-year  yield  up for a third day. It
rose 11 basis points to 6.57 percent at 7:34 a.m. London time.  Two-year yields were 10 basis points higher at 6.33
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
