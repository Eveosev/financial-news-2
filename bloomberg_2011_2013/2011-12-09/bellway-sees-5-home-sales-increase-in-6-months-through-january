Bellway Plc (BWY) , the U.K. homebuilder
focused on first-time buyers, said completed sales will increase
by about 5 percent in the six months through January.  Sales reservations increased 14 percent from Aug. 1 to Nov.
30 compared with a year earlier and the average price rose by
almost 7 percent, the Newcastle-based company said in a
statement. Operating margin will be just under 10 percent of
sales, little changed from a year earlier.  “The outcome for the full year will be dependent primarily
upon  consumer confidence , especially during the spring selling
season,” the company said.  Bellway committed 71 million pounds ($111 million) during
the period on land. The homebuilder plans to have around 215
developments under construction in early 2012, up from 205 at
the end of July, as it seeks growth in volume and operating
margin.  The company also said it renewed a 150 million-pound
banking facility from  Lloyds Banking Group Plc. (LLOY)   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
