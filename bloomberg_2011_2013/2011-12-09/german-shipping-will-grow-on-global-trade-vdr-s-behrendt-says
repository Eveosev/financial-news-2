German shipping companies can expect
growth in the “medium term” because of rising German exports
and increasing global trade, said Michael Behrendt, president of
 German shipowners association  VDR.  Behrendt, who is also the chief executive officer of
container line  Hapag-Lloyd AG , said there is a will in the
industry and among banks to help any shipping companies in
trouble.  Behrendt said he is “optimistic” about freight rates for
next year, after a slump caused by overcapacity. Behrendt spoke
at a VDR press conference in Hamburg today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
