Larry Kantor, the head of research at
 Barclays Capital  in  New York , comments on the euro-region
economy and the outlook for a global recession. Kantor spoke at
a media briefing in London yesterday.  On the economy:  “The euro area, we believe along with others, has entered
recession. The question is how deep and how long?  “The U.S. started the slowdown but it’s showing evidence
of picking up. In emerging markets the slowdown continues. We
think  China  is still slowing and will get worse in the first
quarter of next year. But, in most emerging markets there’s an
easing going on.  “These improvements in emerging markets and the U.S. will
be enough to ease the impact of the euro zone and stop a global
double-dip recession.”  On the ECB meeting yesterday:  “A lot of people called for the  European Central Bank  to
step up and buy a lot of bonds but that’s not the answer. There
would’ve been a rally but what after that? If there’s no follow-
through, no improvement to fiscal rules, it would not improve
confidence, that relief would be temporary.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
