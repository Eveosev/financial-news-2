Ukraine will delay a project to build
a liquefied natural gas terminal on the  Black Sea  after a lack
of interest from investors,  Kommersant-Ukraine  said.  The country will probably use an offshore terminal from
2014 to diversify energy supplies, the newspaper reported,
citing an unidentified official at state-run energy company NAK
Naftogaz Ukrainy.  Ukraine had planned to start an LNG terminal on the Black
Sea from 2013, Vladyslav Kaskiv, the head of Ukraineâ€™s State
Agency for Investment and National Projects, said in June.  -- Editors: Rob Verdonck, Rachel Graham  To contact the reporter on this story:
