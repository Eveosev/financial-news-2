Canadian stocks  rose, paring a weekly
decline, after European nations other than the U.K. agreed to
adopt tougher budget rules to save the euro currency.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) , Canada’s second-largest
energy company by market value, gained 1.6 percent as oil and
gas producers advanced.  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , the country’s
biggest lender by assets, increased 1.4 percent as banks
climbed.  First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM) , Canada’s second-largest
publicly traded copper producer, surged 5.4 percent as copper
futures rallied.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 82.96
points, or 0.7 percent, to 12,034.75, trimming its weekly
retreat to 0.3 percent.  “It’s half a victory,” Irwin Michael, a money manager at
ABC Funds in Toronto, said in a telephone interview. The firm
oversees about C$1 billion ($980 million). “We’d like to see
unanimous agreement. For us to have financial peace and
prosperity in  North America , we have to have some semblance of
tranquility in Europe and Asia.”  The S&P/TSX is set to  underperform  the S&P 500 this year
for the first time since 2003 as companies most-closely tied to
the economy have declined on concern the European debt crisis
will hamper growth. The Canadian index has slumped 10 percent
this year after rallying 50 percent in 2009-2010.  Euro-region leaders agreed to develop “ a new fiscal
compact ” that would limit budget deficits. Because the U.K.
declined to participate, a new treaty would have to be written
to put the rules into effect. Today’s agreement also adds 200
billion euros ($267 billion) to the International Monetary
Fund’s crisis-fighting resources.  Energy Producers  The  S&P/TSX Energy Index (STENRS)  contributed the most to stocks’
gains. Canadian Natural advanced 1.6 percent to C$37.66.  Pacific
Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE) , an energy producer with operations in
Colombia, rebounded 5 percent to C$20.56 after sinking 5.4
percent yesterday.  Precision Drilling Corp. (PD) , Canada’s largest
contract drilling company, increased 5.5 percent to C$11.15.  All  S&P/TSX banks  and insurers climbed after the European
agreement. Royal Bank increased 1.4 percent to C$49.47.  Bank of
Nova Scotia (BNS) , the country’s third-biggest lender by assets,
advanced 1 percent to C$48.98.  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) , North
America’s fourth-largest insurance company, rose 1.4 percent to
C$11.32.  National Bank of Canada (NA) , the country’s sixth-largest lender
by assets, gained 1.6 percent to C$68.10 after Mario Mendonca,
an analyst at Canaccord Financial Inc., and Darko Mihelic, an
analyst at Cormark, raised their ratings on the company.
Mendonca boosted National Bank to “buy” from “hold,” telling
clients in a note that it is less expensive than other lenders
relative to forecast 2012 earnings.  Industrial Metals  Base-metals and coal producers  in the S&P/TSX extended
weekly gains as copper advanced. First Quantum jumped 5.4
percent to C$20.55.  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) , the country’s largest
company in the industry, climbed 1.5 percent to C$37.92.  Silver producers rose as the precious metal with industrial
uses rallied.  Silver Standard Resources Inc. (SSO) , which mines in
Latin America, gained 4.9 percent to C$15.41.  First Majestic
Silver Corp. (FR) , which owns mines in Mexico, advanced 6.5 percent
to C$17.13.  Technology-patent owner Wi-LAN Inc. increased 5.8 percent
to C$5.49. The company said it bought more than 1,400 TV and
video patents and patent applications for $8 million and said it
will buy back up to 5 percent of its shares.  Yoga-wear retailer  Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU)  climbed 3.8
percent to C$48.67 after Howard Tubin, an analyst at Royal Bank,
reiterated his “outperform” rating on the shares. Higher same-
store sales in the third quarter demonstrate the strength of the
Lululemon brand, Tubin wrote in a note to clients.  Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. (VRX) , Canada’s
largest drugmaker, rose 3.5 percent to C$47.92 after a person
with knowledge of the deal said the company increased the size
of a term loan to $500 million from $350 million. Valeant will
use the money to help fund its A$700 million ($715 million)
purchase of Sydney-based iNova Pharmaceuticals (Australia) Pty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
