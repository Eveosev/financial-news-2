Fibria Celulose SA (FIBR3) , the world’s
largest pulp producer, is raising 1.44 billion reais ($767.9
million) in a global share sale, more than initially planned, as
it seeks to cut debt.  The company sold 91.2 million shares, including a
supplementary offering, for 15.83 reais apiece, according to
data posted on the Brazilian securities regulator’s website
yesterday. That’s a 1.1 percent discount over yesterday’s
closing price. Fibria said March 8 it planned to raise about
1.25 billion reais with the offer. The new shares start trading
tomorrow.  Fibria, formed after Votorantim Celulose & Papel SA bailed
out Aracruz Celulose SA because of about $3 billion of
derivatives losses, has raised $7.1 billion in bonds, loans and
asset sales since the 2009 takeover. In December, banks allowed
it to exceed debt caps agreed on 2.5 billion reais of loans
without penalties after the Brazilian real’s decline boosted the
value of foreign obligations.  The pulp maker’s debt rose to a 21 month-high of 4.8 times
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization,
or Ebitda, at the end of last year following the Brazilian
real’s 16 percent plunge in the second half of 2011.  Fibria’s share sale is the fourth in  Brazil  this year.
Companies in  Latin America ’s largest economy have raised about
6.17 billion reais this year, down from 10.1 billion reais in
the same period last year, according to  BM&FBovespa SA (BVMF3) ’s
website.  The Bovespa stock index has  risen  8.5 percent this year
amid easing concerns about  Europe ’s debt crisis and a recovery
in the  U.S. economy .  Votorantim and BNDES  BNDES Participacoes SA, the investment arm of Brazil’s
government-owned development bank, and Votorantim Industrial SA,
bought 51.4 million shares in the sale to maintain their
combined 59.8 percent stake, Fibria said today in a statement
distributed by PR Newswire.  Proceeds of the share sale will be used to reinforce its
cash position and pay off some debt, Fibria said in an April 10
statement.  Fibria’s agreement with banks in December increased debt
limits to 5.5 times Ebitda for the end of the first quarter and
5.25 times for the end of June. Fibria didn’t disclose the
previous limits.  Fibria fell 5.8 percent to 15.07 reais at 1:37 p.m. in  Sao
Paulo . It’s up 10 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
