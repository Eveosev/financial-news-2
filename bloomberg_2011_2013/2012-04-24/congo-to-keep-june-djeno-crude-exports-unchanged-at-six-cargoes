The Republic of Congo will export
six 920,000-barrel cargoes of Djeno crude in June, unchanged
from May, a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  The country also plans to ship one 950,000-barrel
consignment of its N’Kossa grade in June, one less than May,
according to the schedule.  Total SA (FP) ,  France ’s largest oil producer, operates the two
fields. Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude
shipments compiled by field operators to allow buyers and
sellers to plan their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
