Natural-gas prices will remain low
for the rest of the year because so much of the fuel is being
produced in the quest for more-valuable crude oil and petroleum
liquids,  Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (PXD)  Chief Executive Officer
Scott Sheffield said.  Pioneer, the most active driller in Texas’ Permian Basin,
will produce 1.4 billion cubic feet of so-called “associated
gas” a day within a few years just from the four U.S. shale
plays where it is drilling for oil, Sheffield said in an
interview at Hart Energy’s Developing Unconventional Gas
Conference in  Fort Worth , Texas.  The amount of associated gas produced industry-wide is “a
big unknown,” he said.  “I’m pretty confident based on the current rig count, the
oil rig count climbing, that there’ll be plenty of gas coming
out of the liquids-rich plays over the next five years,”
Sheffield said.  There are probably fewer drilling rigs exploring in pure or
“dry” gas fields than the U.S. rig count indicates, Sheffield
said. In  Texas , some rigs that are drilling for oil and liquids
are classified as gas rigs because state rules allow operators
to hold more acreage with a gas well, Sheffield said.  That may make it difficult for producers to slow down gas
production, he said.  “There’s not a lot of dry gas rigs left to drop, maybe a
couple hundred,” he said.  Gas has fallen as low as $1.907 per million British thermal
units this year from a high of $3.096 on Jan. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
