Ethanol futures rose a second day
in  Chicago  on speculation that blending will rise and on export
demand.  Futures climbed on speculation that the biofuel’s discount
to gasoline, which has exceeded $1 for most of the past month,
will boost blending consumption as refiners pocket the
difference between the two fuels.  Exports  in January, the most
recent month data is available from the Energy Department, were
1.82 million barrels, up 33 percent from a year earlier.  “We do have a demand base,” said Mike Blackford, a
consultant with INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa . “It’s
domestic use and just a little bit of exports here.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery advanced 0.2 cent to
settle at $2.166 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices
have dropped 1.7 percent this year.  Production of conventional gasoline mixed with ethanol 
surged to 5.4 million barrels a day in the week ended April 13,
the Energy Department said April 18.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast jumped 3
cents, or 1.3 percent, to $2.315 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf
the additive increased 2 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.22,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago added 2 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.155
a gallon and in  New York  the biofuel climbed 0.75 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $2.25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
