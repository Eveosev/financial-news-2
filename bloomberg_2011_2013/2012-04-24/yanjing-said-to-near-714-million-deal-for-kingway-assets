Beijing Yanjing Brewery Co. (000729) ,
 China ’s fourth-largest domestic beer maker, is nearing an
agreement to buy brewery assets from  Kingway Brewery Holdings
Ltd. (124)  for as much as 4.5 billion yuan ($714 million), said people
with knowledge of the matter.  Yanjing is a frontrunner after beating an offer from
 Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI) , two people said, asking not to be
identified because the talks are confidential.  China Resources
Snow Brewery Co. (291)  dropped out of bidding last month, they said.  Yanjing is expanding in China to gain market share as
provincial brewers compete in the country’s fragmented beer
market and prevent each other’s products from being sold
locally. Yanjing had about 12 percent of China’s beer market by
volume last year, according to data compiled by Euromonitor
International. Just four of the 27 beer makers in China hold
more than a 5 percent share of the market, the data show.  An agreement may exclude plants in Shenzhen because Kingway
wants to keep those properties, two people familiar with the
situation said. The deal may value the remaining assets at 4
billion yuan to 4.5 billion yuan, they said.  Kingway  rose 3.5 percent  to HK$3.00 a share as of 10:23
a.m. after rising as much as 4.8 percent earlier today. Yanjing
dropped 0.7 percent to 15.06 yuan in Shanghai trading.  Beer Market Growth  Guangdong-based Kingway put the assets up for sale in
January as it lost market share in its home province to
competitors including  Tsingtao Brewery Co.  and Yanjing. The
company said last month its 2011 profit dropped 4.1 percent on
rising competition and production costs.  Two calls to Ding Guangxue, a Beijing-based spokesman for
Yanjing, went unanswered yesterday. Vanessa Wong, Kingway’s
secretary in Hong Kong, declined to comment, as did Leuven,
Belgium-based Karen Couck at AB Inbev.  China Resources Snow Brewery is a joint venture between
 SABMiller Plc (SAB)  and China Resources Enterprise Ltd. China
Resources Enterprise’s Hong Kong-based spokesman Vincent Tse
declined to comment yesterday.  Yanjing’s earnings are estimated to rise to  1 billion yuan 
this year, an increase of 23 percent from 2011, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The company shipped 5.45 billion
liters of beer last year, making it the nation’s fourth-largest
producer after China Resources, Tsingtao and AB Inbev, according
to Euromonitor data. The researcher expects China’s beer market
to grow 29 percent in the five years to 2016.  Kingway’s average cost to produce a metric ton of beer
increased by 12 percent last year from 2010, causing its gross
profit margin to narrow to 17.9 percent from 21.8 percent, the
company said in March. Beer sales increased by 1 percent to
934,000 metric tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
