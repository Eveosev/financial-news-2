Yields on benchmark 10-year
Treasuries were at almost an eight-week low before the U.S.
sells $99 billion of notes this week amid speculation the
 Federal Reserve  will keep borrowing rates at record lows.  Two-year note yields touched the lowest since Feb. 10 as
the Treasury prepared to kick off the auctions today with the
sale of $35 billion of the securities and the central bank
begins a two-day policy meeting.  “It’s hard to argue that there is much value in Treasuries
at this point, but given the uncertainties in the market it’s
almost impossible to have any sustained selloff,”  Adrian Miller , a fixed-income strategist at GMP Securities LLC in New
York, said in a telephone interview. “So we sit at sub-2
percent yields and wait for clarity from the Fed and from
overseas.”  The  yield  on the 10-year note climbed two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 1.96 percent at 11:28 a.m. in  New
York , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent
note maturing in February 2022 fell 7/32, or $2.19 per $1,000-
face amount, to 100 11/32. The yield dropped to 1.91 percent
yesterday, the lowest since Feb. 28.  In addition to today’s auction, the U.S. plans to sell $35
billion of five-year debt tomorrow and $29 billion of seven-year
securities on April 26.  The two-year notes being sold today yielded 0.27 percent in
pre-auction trading, compared with 0.34 percent at the previous
sale of the securities on March 27, the highest since July.
Investors bid for 3.69 times the debt on offer last month, up
from 3.54 times in February.  Two-Year Yield  The  two-year yield  was little changed at 0.26 percent after
touching 0.254 percent, the lowest since Feb. 10.  The yield on the two-year note is below the 200-day moving
average of 0.2628 percent and may encounter resistance at 0.25
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield may
find support at the 100-day moving average of 0.2763 percent,
the data show.  Resistance refers to an area on a chart where technical
analysts anticipate orders to sell a security to be clustered
and a support level is an area where they anticipate buy orders
will be grouped.  Trading  volume  climbed yesterday to $170.6 billion after
dropping April 20 to the lowest level this year, with about $130
billion of Treasuries changing hands through ICAP Plc, the
world’s largest interdealer broker. The average in 2012 is $252
billion. Volume reached $439 billion on March 14, the highest
since August.  ‘Keeping Rates Low’  “People don’t want to short the Treasury market,” said
Paul Horrmann, a broker in New York at Tradition Asiel
Securities Inc., an interdealer broker. “The Fed is still going
to be keeping rates low till 2014. You can’t fight the Fed.” A
short is a bet the price of a security will drop.  The Netherlands sold 2 billion euros ($2.63 billion) of
debt today amid optimism the collapse of its government
yesterday won’t derail efforts to implement budget cuts.  Spain 
auctioned 1.9 billion euros of bills.  Dutch 10-year bond yields declined nine basis points to
2.34 percent, while similar-maturity Spanish yields dropped 14
basis points to 5.86 percent.  Investors in U.S. Treasuries reduced expectations that
prices of the securities will climb as the percentage of so-
called long positions dropped in a weekly survey by JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  The percent of net longs in the firm’s all-clients survey
dropped to two percentages points, to 23 percent from 25
percent, in the week ended yesterday. The number of outright
neutrals was unchanged at 57 percent. The level of outright
shorts rose to 21 percent from 19 percent the previous week.  ‘Hoping for Relief’  Ten-year yields may be in a range of 2 percent to 2.5
percent with the potential to rise to 2.75 percent in 2012,
according to Charles Schwab Corp., which is based in  San
Francisco  and manages $199 billion.  “We don’t anticipate that the Fed will change policy this
year and it seems unlikely at this juncture that they will
engage in more” asset purchases, Kathy A. Jones, a fixed-income
strategist at the company, wrote in an e-mail.  The central bank bought $4.758 billion of Treasuries due
from April 2018 to February 2020 today. The purchases are part
of the bank’s effort to replace $400 billion of shorter-term
debt in its holdings with longer maturities to hold down
borrowing costs.  U.S. central bankers bought $2.3 trillion of bonds in two
rounds of so-called quantitative easing between December 2008
and June. They’ve also said they will probably keep their target
for overnight lending between banks at almost zero at least
until late 2014. Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  is scheduled to hold a
press conference tomorrow.  “Everybody is hoping for relief from insight from the
Fed,” said Tradition Asiel’s Horrmann.  To contact the reporters on this story:
