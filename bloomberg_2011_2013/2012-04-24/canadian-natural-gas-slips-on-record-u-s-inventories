Canadian natural gas declined amid
analyst estimates that stockpiles of the fuel in the U.S. grew
by more than the five-year average.  Alberta  gas fell 2.3 percent. U.S. stockpiles probably
increased 51 billion cubic feet last week, the median of 11
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Estimates ranged from
gains of 40 billion to 64 billion cubic feet. Inventories have
risen an average 47 billion cubic feet in the same week over the
past five years, according to the Energy Department.  “It’s as bearish as can be,” said Gordy Elliott, a risk-
management specialist with INTL FC Stone LLC in  St. Louis Park ,
 Minnesota . “We could see storage full this summer.”  Alberta gas for May delivery declined 3.5 cents to C$1.50 a
gigajoule ($1.44 per million British thermal units) as of 3:45
p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in Canada
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.
NGX gas is down 48 percent this year.  Natural gas for May delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  slipped 3.2 cents to settle at $1.975 per million Btu.  Gas for prompt delivery gained amid forecasts of colder-
than-normal weather in the U.S. Midwest, the biggest consuming
region for Canada’s gas exports. Temperatures in Chicago will
drop to 37 degrees Fahrenheit (3 Celsius) April 27, 9 degrees
below seasonal norms, according to AccuWeather Inc.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago gained
7.25 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $2.1078 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western  Canada .  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas advanced 9.14 cents, or 5.2 percent, to $1.8642
per million Btu. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded
for California markets, prices rose 10.57 cents, or 5.7 percent,
to $1.9644.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.7 billion cubic
feet, 136 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.16 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.23 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at  Kingsgate  was 939 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.71 billion cubic feet today, or 65 percent of its
capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy ’s British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.25
billion cubic feet at 2:35 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
