ViroPharma Inc. (VPHM)  lost a bid for a
court order temporarily blocking U.S. Food and Drug
Administration marketing approval of generic forms of its
biggest-selling drug, the antibiotic Vancocin.  U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle in Washington
yesterday denied the company’s bid for injunctive relief in a
42-page ruling, saying ViroPharma failed to show it was likely
to prevail on its claim the government decision was arbitrary or
that the restraint would be in the public interest.  “ViroPharma is evaluating potential legal options,” the
company said today in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
filing disclosing Huvelle’s decision.  Vancocin, which the Exton, Pennsylvania-based company has
described as a “drug of last resort” for people with
gastrointestinal infections, accounted for about $289 million in
sales last year, about half of ViroPharma’s revenue.  The drugmaker sued the FDA and the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services on April 13, three days after  Akorn
Inc. (AKRX)  and  Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI)  announced they had gained
government approval to market generic forms of Vancocin.
ViroPharma sought injunctive relief and an order granting it
exclusivity to market its drug through Dec. 15, 2014.  While not named as defendants in the complaint, Akorn and
Watson were granted court permission to intervene in the case on
the side of the government and then filed papers opposing
ViroPharma’s request.  ViroPharma has fallen more than 25 percent since April 10.
The shares rose 3 cents to $21.37 at 1:03 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  The case is ViroPharma Inc. v. Hamburg, 12-cv-584, U.S.
District Court for the  District of Columbia  ( Washington ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
