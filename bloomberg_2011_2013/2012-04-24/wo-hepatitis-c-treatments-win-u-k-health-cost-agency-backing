Merck & Co. (MRK) ’s Victrelis and  Johnson
& Johnson (JNJ) ’s Incivo won the backing of the U.K.’s health-cost
adviser in final guidance on the treatment of hepatitis C, a
virus that causes illness in 85 percent of infected people.  Each of the two drugs offers a cost-effective option for
the most common form of the infection when used with older drugs
peginterferon alfa and ribavirin, the  National Institute for
Health and Clinical Excellence  said today in an e-mailed
statement. The agency advises the state-run National Health
Service on which products represent value for money.  Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, won
approval to market Victrelis in Europe in July. J&J of New
Brunswick,  New Jersey , won European approval for Incivo in
September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
