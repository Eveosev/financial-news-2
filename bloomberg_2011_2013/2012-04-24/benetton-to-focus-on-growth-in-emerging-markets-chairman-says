Benetton SpA (BEN)  will focus on growth
in  emerging markets  such as India, Russia, Turkey and Central
America, said Alessandro Benetton, who today replaced his father
Luciano as chairman of the clothing maker.  “We need to be very opportunistic,” Benetton said in a
Bloomberg Television interview at the company’s annual meeting
today in Treviso, Italy.  The February decision to delist the company from the
Italian Stock Exchange was inevitable because the group needs to
have a “longer-term horizon” for strategy, he said.  The company also must work on its marketing strategy to
convince consumers it has “high-quality products at an
accessible price,” said Benetton, whose appointment was
confirmed by shareholders at today’s meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
