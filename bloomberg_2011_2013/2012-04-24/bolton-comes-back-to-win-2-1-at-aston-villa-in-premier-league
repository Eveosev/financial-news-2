Bolton got two goals in two minutes
to come back and win 2-1 at  Aston Villa  yesterday as the club
struggles to get out of the relegation zone of English soccer’s
Premier League.  The home team went ahead when  Stephen Warnock  scored in the
61st minute.  Martin Petrov  scored a penalty a minute later,
followed by David Ngog’s goal in the 63rd minute.  Villa has won just one of its last 13 league games, and is
three points above Bolton, which remains in the relegation zone.
Bolton move up to 18th, one point behind Queens Park Rangers and
Wigan, which each have 34 points. Villa supporters used chants
to demand the dismissal of manager  Alex McLeish  after the loss.  “I can understand the fans’ reaction,” McLeish said. “We
went into a deserved lead and to see the game turn like it did
was horrible. “The reaction was a first for me. But, like I
said, it was understandable because we had the three points in
our grasp.”  Villa plays 10th-place West Brom this weekend, while Bolton
travels to 11th-place Sunderland. Villa has won just four home
games, setting a mark for its worst home season in history. The
team won six times in the 1994-95 and 2004-2005 seasons.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
