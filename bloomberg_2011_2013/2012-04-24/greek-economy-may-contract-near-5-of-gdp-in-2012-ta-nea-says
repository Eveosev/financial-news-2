Greece ’s central bank forecasts the
country’s economy will contract by almost 5 percent of gross
domestic product this year, which is higher than a 4.5 percent
estimate made last month,  Ta Nea  reported, without saying where
it got the information.  A  Bank of Greece  report to be released today sees the
economy returning to growth in the second half of 2013, the
Athens-based newspaper said. Unemployment in 2012 is expected at
19 percent, Ta Nea reported.  Governor  George Provopoulos  will outline at the
institution’s general meeting today that Greece must choose
between reforming its economy with the help of its European
Union and International Monetary Fund partners or find itself
out of the euro, the newspaper said.  Recapitalization of Greece’s banks will help improve the
economic environment and the central bank expects the process to
be successful, Ta Nea reported. Greece must speed up state asset
sales and better absorb EU funds, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
