Taiwan ’s government bonds gained,
pushing  five-year yields  to a one-week low, as investors favored
the safest assets on concern political shifts in Europe will
lead to a worsening of the region’s debt crisis. The island’s
dollar was little changed.  Overseas investors sold $2.7 million more local stocks than
they bought today, according to exchange data. The MSIC Asia-
Pacific Index of shares fell for a fourth day after Dutch Prime
Minister  Mark Rutte  tendered his resignation and as French
President  Nicolas Sarkozy  trailed his Socialist challenger in a
presidential race. Official data showed yesterday Taiwan’s
industrial production dropped 3.42 percent in March from a year
earlier, after an 8.4 percent gain the previous month.  “We’re seeing risk-off sentiment today due to headline
news from  Europe ,” said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based
strategist at  Credit Agricole . “The external environment needs
to improve for Asian currencies to be able to enjoy another leg
up, and they seem vulnerable in the short term.”  The yield on Taiwan’s 1 percent securities due January 2017
dropped one basis point to 1.031 percent, the lowest level since
April 12, according to Gretai Securities Market.  The government sold NT$40 billion ($1.4 billion) of 20-year
bonds today at 1.725 percent, up from 1.708 percent at a March
sale of the same maturity.  Taiwan’s dollar was little changed at NT$29.526 against its
U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched
NT$29.395 yesterday, the strongest level since April 5. One-
month implied volatility on the  Taiwan dollar , a measure of
exchange-rate swings traders use to price options, rose seven
basis points to 3.4 percent. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  The overnight  money-market  rate was steady at 0.494 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center. It reached 0.497 percent yesterday, the highest
level since 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
