What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 10 cents to 12 cents a bushel higher
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that warm, dry
weather reduced production in South America, boosting demand
prospects for U.S. supplies, said Greg Grow, the director of
agribusiness for Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago.
Soybean-oil futures are expected to open 0.25 cent to 0.35 cent
a pound higher, and soybean-meal futures may open up $3 to $5
per 2,000 pounds.  -- Corn futures are called to open 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel
higher on the Chicago Board of Trade on speculation that China
will boost imports of U.S. grain to increase feed supplies for
expanding hog herds, Grow said in a telephone interview.  -- Wheat futures may open 4 cents to 6 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and  Minneapolis Grain
Exchange  on speculation that cold weather will damage U.S.
crops, Grow said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
