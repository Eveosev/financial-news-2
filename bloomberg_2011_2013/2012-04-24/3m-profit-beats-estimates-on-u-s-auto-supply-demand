3M Co. (MMM) , the maker of Post-it Notes
and fuel system tuneup kits, gained in U.S. trading after
posting a first-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates
because of rising domestic auto and industrial demand.  Net income climbed 4.1 percent to $1.13 billion, or $1.59 a
share, 3M said today in a statement. Per-share results included
a 4-cent charge for early retirements. Analysts projected
earnings of $1.49, the average of 15  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg.  The U.S. market drove sales at the industrial and
transportation unit, the largest division at St. Paul,
Minnesota-based 3M. Operating profit slumped 29 percent at the
display and graphics business, which serves the manufacturers of
liquid crystal display televisions with optical films.  “The fact that they were able to beat numbers with their
technologies business seeing declines in operating income year
over year is a good sign the rest of their businesses are
operating pretty well,”  Mark Demos , a portfolio manager at
Fifth Third Asset Management in Minneapolis, said in a telephone
interview. He helps oversee $18 billion including 3M shares.  3M gained 1.6 percent to $88.49 at the close in  New York .
That pushed the stock’s year-to-date advance to 8.3 percent.  The company also raised the low end of its 2012 profit
forecast, saying earnings would be in a range of $6.35 to $6.50
a share, from a previous floor of $6.25.  U.S. Sales Rise  Sales rose 2.4 percent to $7.49 billion. That exceeded the
average estimate of $7.44 billion, based on eight analysts’
predictions compiled by Bloomberg. The U.S. saw a 6.3 percent
increase. That helped make up for a 1.9 percent drop in the
Asia-Pacific region and a 0.1 percent rise in  Europe ,  Middle
East  and  Africa .  The industrial and transportation unit posted sales of
$2.66 billion, an 8.6 percent increase, while sales rose 5.6
percent to $981 million at the safety and security business.
Revenue from the display and graphics division fell 12 percent
to $832 million. Sales dropped 3.3 percent to $808 million at
the electronics and communications unit.  Chief Executive Officer Inge Thulin, 58, said in a Feb. 8
interview he plans to maintain the company’s current strategy of
growth through emerging-market expansion and spending on
research. He succeeded  George Buckley , who had served as CEO
since December 2005 and reached the company’s mandatory
retirement age of 65.  To contact the reporter on this story:
