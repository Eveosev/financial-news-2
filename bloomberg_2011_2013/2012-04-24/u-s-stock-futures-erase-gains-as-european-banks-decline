U.S. stock futures erased earlier
gains after a decline in European lenders.  S&P 500 futures expiring in June added less than 0.1
percent to 1,363.2 at 8:50 a.m. New York time, after rising as
much as 0.5 earlier.  An index of European banks fell 0.5 percent, reversing
earlier gains.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
