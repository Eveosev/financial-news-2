(Corrects extent and scope of decline in ETP silver
holdings in headline and story first published yesterday.)  Silver holdings in exchange-traded
products declined 0.5 percent, the most since December, as
prices traded near a three-month low and exchange stockpiles
climbed, underscoring concern a global economic slowdown may
curb demand.  Assets in ETPs fell to 17,564 metric tons yesterday, the
lowest level since Jan. 30. Silver dropped as much as 3.8
percent to $30.48 an ounce yesterday, the lowest price since
Jan. 20, and traded at $30.9325 by 1:35 p.m. in  London  today.  Demand for silver fell in 2011 for the first year in four
as  Europe ’s debt crisis sapped industrial use of the metal found
in solar panels and photography, Thomson Reuters GFMS said in a
report on April 19.  “The price drop drives fund selling and that in turn
drives prices even lower,” said Sun Yonggang, an analyst at
Everbright Futures Co., a unit of China’s largest state-owned
investment group. “Silver isn’t holding up as well as gold
because it is still primarily an industrial metal.”  Gold holdings  in ETPs have advanced 1.6 percent year this
year, according to data tracked by Bloomberg, and are at 2,394.2
metric tons. That’s within 0.7 percent of the all-time high set
in March. Silver ETP holdings dropped 4.5 percent in 2011.  Industrial Use  Manufacturing in the euro area and  China  is contracting,
separate reports showed yesterday, boosting demand for the
dollar as a haven. Silver and gold often trade inversely to the
U.S. currency.  Total silver demand fell 3.2 percent to 1.04 billion ounces
in 2011, the first decline since 2007, according to the report
from GFMS, which was published by the Washington-based Silver
Institute. Industrial consumption slipped 2.7 percent to 486.5
million ounces, according to the report.  CME Group Inc. on April 12 cut margins for silver futures
on the Comex. The amount speculators must keep on deposit for an
initial account in silver futures was cut 13 percent to $18,900
from $21,600, effective after the close of business April 16.  “It’s possible after the margin change, some people
switched out of the ETPs into futures,” said Nick Trevethan,
Singapore-based senior commodities strategist at  Australia & New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)   Open interest in the most active silver contract in  New
York  climbed to 46,056 contracts yesterday, the highest level
since April 10. Stockpiles of the metal tracked by Comex climbed
for a second day to 140.59 million ounces yesterday. Inventories
reached 141.59 million ounces on April 13, the highest level
since September 1997.  ‘Choppy’ Price  “Silver is set to maintain its choppy price action given
the strain industrial demand is under,”  Suki Cooper , an analyst
at  Barclays Capital  in New York, wrote in a report today. “The
limited investor participation means the metal has scope to
gather momentum to the upside should appetite grow from a weak
base.”  Silver may average $33.78 an ounce this quarter, $36.11 in
the third quarter, and $35.93 in the fourth quarter, according
to the mean of analysts’ forecasts tracked by Bloomberg. The
metal for immediate delivery averaged $32.67 in the first
quarter of this year.  Bloomberg competes with  Thomson Reuters  in selling
