Rising international ticket sales
will help fund more movie production as the global audience for
entertainment expands, said  Christopher Dodd , chairman of the
 Motion Picture Association  of America.  China ’s recent decision to allow increased distribution
foreign films is one example of how the global box office is
increasing revenue for the U.S. film industry, Dodd said today
at the  CinemaCon  trade show in  Las Vegas .  Hollywood films are generating twice as much ticket revenue
outside the domestic market -- the U.S. and  Canada . Last year,
international sales rose 7 percent to $22.4 billion, helped by a
35 percent jump in China. Domestic sales dropped 4 percent to
$10.2 billion, according to MPAA  figures .  “Those international ticket sales will fund more
production around the world, which means more and better
movies,” Dodd, a former Democratic Senator, said in prepared
remarks.  In February, China expanded the annual quota of foreign
films to 34 from 20. The additional 14 slots will be devoted to
pictures formatted for large-screen or 3-D presentation. The
share of ticket sales collected by foreign producers was
expanded to 25 percent from 13 percent.  The Washington-based MPAA represents the six largest U.S.
movie studios, including  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Twentieth Century Fox,
 Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s Warner Bros.,  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s Universal
Pictures,  Viacom Inc. (VIAB) ’s Paramount Pictures and  Sony Corp. (6758) ’s Sony
Pictures Entertainment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
