New Zealand ’s dollar will decline
in coming years as lower commodity prices and a wider current
account deficit weigh on sentiment, the nation’s largest non-
government investor says.  “The currency should be in the 70s not the 80s,” Keith
Poore, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors
Ltd., told reporters in Wellington. It bought 81.4 cents at 2:35
p.m. in Wellington.  The currency’s fair value is 65 U.S. cents to 70 cents,
Poore said. He expects it will start to decline toward that
level, perhaps reaching about 76 cents in a year’s time.  Commodity prices have fallen 8.5 percent in March from a
year earlier led by a slump in dairy products, and are forecast
to head lower, Poore said. The current account deficit is 4
percent of gross domestic product and is expected to widen in
coming years, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
