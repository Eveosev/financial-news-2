Development Partners International,
a London-based private equity fund that invests in sub-Saharan
 Africa , plans to spend as much as $750 million on projects in
the region over seven years, said Chief Executive Officer Runa Alam.  The fund is looking for investment opportunities in
banking, insurance, oil and gas, telecommunications and
pharmaceuticals, she said in an interview in Accra, Ghana’s
capital, yesterday, on the sidelines of a forum on venture
capital in Africa. DPI is interested in “a whole spectrum of
products and services demanded by Africa’s developing middle
class,” Alam said.  The company has invested $400 million in the past four
years in nine companies across Africa, including Kenya, Nigeria
and Ghana, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
