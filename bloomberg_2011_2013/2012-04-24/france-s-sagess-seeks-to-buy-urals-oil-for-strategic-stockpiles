Societe Anonyme de Gestion de
Stocks de Securite, or Sagess as the manager of  France ’s
strategic stockpiles is known, issued a tender to buy Russian
Urals crude for delivery in May.  The tender is for 115,000 cubic meters, or 723,350 barrels,
of Urals for May 10 to May 30 delivery to the northern French
port of  Le Havre , said Jean-Marc Tenneson, executive officer of
Comite Professionnel des Stocks Strategiques Petroliers, or
CPSSP as the body which controls Sagess is known, said today by
phone from Paris. The tender closes on May 3.  The agency is seeking to increase crude inventories to meet
its requirement for strategic stock levels as of July 1, he
said. The country is obliged to store 17.8 million metric tons
of crude and oil products as of July 1 and the CPSSP is
responsible for 13.1 million tons of this, Tenneson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
