RadioShack Corp. (RSH)  tumbled to its
lowest price in 31 years after the consumer-electronics retailer
reported an unexpected first-quarter loss, hurt by falling U.S.
demand for mobile phones and laptop computers.  The shares declined 11 percent to $5.34 at the close in New
York, the lowest price since Feb. 24, 1981.  Fort Worth , Texas-
based RadioShack has declined 45 percent this year.  Chief Executive Officer Jim Gooch plans to open about 50
stores in Mexico and step up marketing of mobile phones after a
same-store sales decline of 4.2 percent. Total revenue slipped
less than 1 percent to $1 billion, hurt by a 6.9 percent sales
drop at company-owned U.S. stores, RadioShack said today in a
statement.  “We were expecting bad, just not this bad,”  Anthony Chukumba , an analyst at BB&T Capital Markets in New York, wrote
today in a note to clients. He rates the shares hold.
“Management faces an uphill climb to turn things around.”  The net loss in the three months ended March 31 was $8
million, or 8 cents a share, compared with profit of $35.1
million, or 33 cents, a year earlier. Analysts projected profit
of 4 cents a share, the average of  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
