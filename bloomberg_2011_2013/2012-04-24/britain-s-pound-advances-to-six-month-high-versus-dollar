The pound reached an almost six-
month high against the dollar before a report tomorrow that
economists said will show the U.K. avoided a recession, boosting
the case for the  Bank of England  to pause its asset purchases.  Sterling rose to the strongest in 20 months versus the euro
after the Debt Management Office said Britain’s net financing
requirement had fallen. Ten-year gilts were little changed
before tomorrow’s first-quarter growth figures, which will show
gross domestic product gained 0.1 percent after shrinking 0.3
percent in the fourth quarter, according to a Bloomberg survey.
Minutes of the Bank of England’s April meeting showed policy
maker  Adam Posen  dropped his push for extra quantitative easing.  “The pound has an asymmetry to it at the moment, it
performs well when the market is both risk-on and -off,” said
 Neil Jones , head of European hedge-fund sales at Mizuho
Corporate Bank Ltd. in  London . “Posen has shifted the pound
landscape. I would suggest QE is done.”  The pound was little changed at $1.6135 at 4:47 p.m. London
time. It climbed as much as 0.2 percent to $1.6164, the most
since Oct. 31. Sterling was 0.3 percent weaker at 81.82 pence
per euro after reaching 81.44 pence, the strongest level since
Aug. 23, 2010.  Asset Purchases  The euro advanced against all but two of its 16 major peers
tracked by Bloomberg today, including the pound, after  Spain ,
 Italy  and the Netherlands sold bonds, damping concern the
region’s sovereign-debt crisis is worsening.  Britain’s currency has climbed 1.8 percent in the past
month, the best performer among the 10 developed-nation
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The euro dropped 0.7 percent.  A report last week showed U.K. inflation unexpectedly
accelerated for the first time in six months in March, fueling
speculation the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee will
pause its 325 billion-pound asset-purchase program on May 10.  Barclays Plc improved its three-month forecast for the
pound against the euro to 79 pence from 84 pence, it said in a
report yesterday. It also increased its 12-month prediction to
76 pence from 80 pence.  It recommends betting on a decline in the common currency
against the pound and advises waiting until after the GDP
release tomorrow. Investors should buy the pound at 81.90 pence
per euro, betting that it will strengthen to 78.00 pence. They
should exit the trade if sterling weakens to 82.70 pence,
Barclays said.  Gilt Sales  U.K. 10-year bond yields were three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, lower at 2.10 percent. The 4 percent security
due March 2022 rose 0.255, or 2.55 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 116.875 percent of face value.  Yields are retreating from tests above the 50-day moving
average of 2.18 percent and should find support at the April low
of 2.01 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Planned gilt sales for the current fiscal were cut by 2
percent to 164.4 billion pounds after Britain’s financing
requirement needs fell, the nation’s Debt Management Office said
today.  The U.K. sold 4.75 billion pounds of gilts maturing in 2052
through banks today, with nearly 12 percent of the securities
being purchased by overseas investors, according to the Debt
Management Office. The sale received total orders of 9.8 billion
pounds, the office said in a statement.  U.K. net borrowing excluding support for banks was 18.2
billion pounds in March, compared with 18 billion pounds a year
earlier, the  Office for National Statistics  said today. The
median of 20 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey was for a
shortfall of 16 billion pounds.  Gilts have handed investors a loss of 1.4 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. That’s the
third-worst performance among 26 sovereign markets tracked by
the indexes after Spain and  Greece .  -- With assistance from TJ Marta in  New York . Editors: Mark
