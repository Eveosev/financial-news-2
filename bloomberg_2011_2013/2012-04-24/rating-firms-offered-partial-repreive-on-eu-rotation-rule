Companies that issue large amounts
of debt instruments may win an exemption from European Union
plans to force them to rotate the credit-ratings providers that
assess their debt.  They would avoid the rotation rule if they simultaneously
hire at least four ratings firms, under proposals by Denmark,
which holds the six-month presidency of the EU.  The measure would scale back a draft law by  Michel Barnier , the region’s financial services chief, that
would have forced businesses to change every three years the
rating company that gauges their creditworthiness.  While Barnier has said rotation would boost competition and
solve potential conflicts of interest, regulators have warned
that the requirement may worsen the quality of ratings in the
short term.  Denmark’s compromise plan, published on the EU website,
follows discussions with officials from the other 26 national
governments in the region. The ratings law requires approval by
national governments and by lawmakers in the European
Parliament, before it can come into effect.  Denmark has already proposed to limit the rotation rule to
structured finance instruments, such as securitizations, and to
lengthen the period that a business can hire the same ratings
firm from three years to six.  The new Danish exemption plans, dated April 20, add to
these earlier proposals.  Companies seeking to benefit from the exemption would have
to ensure that each of the ratings suppliers they hire rates at
least 10 percent of the structured finance instruments they
issue,  Denmark  said in the document.  To contact the reporter on this story:
