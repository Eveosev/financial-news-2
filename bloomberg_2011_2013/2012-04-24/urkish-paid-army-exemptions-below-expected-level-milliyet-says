Applications to pay for exemption
from  Turkey â€™s mandatory military service were far below what was
expected and may bring in less than a 10th of the income the
 Finance Ministry  estimated, the  Milliyet newspaper  reported.  Some 22,500 people have applied to pay for the exemption
under a law that was ratified in December, out of a pool of
460,000 potential applicants, the Istanbul-based newspaper
reported. The measure will bring in at most 1.2 billion liras
($670 million) should applications continue at this pace,
compared with the 13 billion liras officials expected, Milliyet
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
