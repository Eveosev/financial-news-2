The  Asian Development Bank  agreed
to lend a further $103 million to a solar power project owned by
 Reliance Power Ltd. (RPWR)  in  India .  The Manila-based bank approved a $48 million loan for
Reliance’s 40-megawatt Dahanu photovoltaic project in December.
That plant is being expanded to include a 100-megawatt solar-
thermal farm, S. Chander, the ADB’s director-general of
sustainable development, said today at a conference in Jodhpur
in Rajasthan state.  Solar-thermal technology harnesses sunlight to heat liquids
that produce steam for generators; photovoltaic plants use
panels to turn sunlight directly into power.  The solar-thermal plant is expected to be completed in May
2013 and will cost about $415 million, according to Michael
Barrow, a director at the ADB. It will be built adjacent to the
photovoltaic plant, and the two will share a transmission line,
he said.  Reliance earlier this month selected France’s  Areva SA (AREVA)  as
its contractor to build as much as 250 megawatts of solar-
thermal capacity in India. The U.S. Export-Import Bank said on
April 13 that it will provide Reliance with an $80.3 million
loan to purchase technology from Areva’s U.S. unit and other 
suppliers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
