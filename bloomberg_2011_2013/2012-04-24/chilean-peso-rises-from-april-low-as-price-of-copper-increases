Chile ’s peso advanced from its
lowest level this month on an increase in the price of copper,
the country’s biggest export.  The peso’s gain was limited by dollar purchases in the
local market, according to Ronald Volpi, head of spot currency
trading at EuroAmerica Corredores de Bolsa SA in Santiago.  “Copper is up more than 1 percent,” Volpi said. “The
peso should be stronger. The only explanation is that there’s a
lot of real demand for dollars.”  The currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 487.75 per  U.S.
dollar , from 488.60 yesterday, when it touched 490.25, the
weakest intraday level since March 29. The Bloomberg JPMorgan
Latin American Currency Index rose 0.2 percent to 105.57 today.  Copper rose as much as 1.7 percent in  New York  after data
showed a jump in orders to remove the metal from London Metal
Exchange warehouses. Copper makes up half of Chile’s exports.  The dollar fell against most Latin American currencies
after the Netherlands sold bonds, easing concern  Europe ’s
sovereign-debt crisis is spreading to its strongest economies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
