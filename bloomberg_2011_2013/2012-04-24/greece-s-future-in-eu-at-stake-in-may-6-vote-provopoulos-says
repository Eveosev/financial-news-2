Greece  is at a critical point in
its history, with the country’s future in the euro area at stake
in next month’s elections,  Bank of Greece  Governor  George Provopoulos  said.  The country must choose between “an organized and
painstaking effort to reconstruct the economy within the euro
area” with the help of its European partners, or “regressing
decades socially and economically, which would eventually lead
the country out of the euro area and the European Union,”
Provopoulos said at the Athens-based central bank’s annual
general meeting today, according to an e-mailed transcript of
his speech.  Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  called elections for May 6
after his interim government carried out the biggest sovereign
debt restructuring in history and secured a 130 billion-euro
($172 billion) bailout, the country’s second, from the EU and
International Monetary Fund. While the rescue package has
improved conditions for Greece, the country must work to meet
the targets it sets, said Provopoulos, who is also a member of
the  European Central Bank ’s governing council.  Greece’s economy will shrink by almost 5 percent this year,
more than the 4.5 percent contraction the  Bank of Greece (TELL) 
forecast in a report last month, Provopoulos said.  After the elections the new government must fully implement
reforms including modernizing the administrative and tax
systems, Provopoulos said. This year will be a landmark in
forming a healthy banking system, which is needed for
sustainable growth, he said.  Greece can achieve a primary surplus in 2013 and its
economy is expected to start to recover at the end of that year,
Provopoulos said. Unemployment this year will be more than 19
percent and inflation will average 1.2 percent and could fall
below 0.5 percent next year, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
