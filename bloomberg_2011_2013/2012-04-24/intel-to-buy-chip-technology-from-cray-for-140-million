Intel Corp. (INTC) , the world’s largest
semiconductor maker, agreed to acquire technology used to
connect server chips from  Cray Inc. (CRAY)  for $140 million.  Intel will also get 74 of Cray’s employees when it
purchases the technology, Seattle-based Cray said in a statement
today. The transaction will close before the end of the current
quarter, Intel said in a separate statement.  Intel will use the technology and the design team to help
growth in so-called high-performance computing. HPC uses high-
end machines to perform mathematically demanding tasks such as
financial risk calculation or the analysis of data in oil and
gas exploration.  Shares of Intel, based in  Santa Clara , California, slipped
14 cents, or less than 1 percent, to $27.31 at the close in  New
York . That left the shares up 13 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
