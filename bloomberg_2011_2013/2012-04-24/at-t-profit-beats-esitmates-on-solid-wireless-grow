AT&T Inc. (T) , the largest U.S. phone
company, posted first-quarter earnings that beat analysts’
estimates on lower smartphone upgrade costs and an increase in
wireless data sales related to  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad.  Earnings climbed to 60 cents a share from 57 cents a year
earlier, Dallas-based AT&T said today in a statement. Analysts
projected 57 cents, the average of estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales rose 1.8 percent to $31.8 billion, in line with
the average analyst  estimate .  AT&T activated 4.3 million iPhones and sold 240,000
tablets, with about 180,000 of the tablets on data plan
contracts. That helped boost monthly bills and offset slower
subscriber growth in a market where most people already have
mobile phones. While contract-customer gains narrowed from the
fourth quarter and trailed those at Verizon Wireless, the
increase in average revenue per user beat analysts’ estimates.  “Rising ARPU means the carriers are able to increase data
pricing, which is good for the industry,”  Walter Piecyk , an
analyst at BTIG LLC in New York who rates AT&T shares neutral.
Piecyk also said the upgrade rate -- when users trade in old
phones for new ones at a subsidized price -- slowed to 7 percent
from 11.9 percent in the fourth quarter.  AT&T  rose  3.6 percent to $31.72 at the close in New York.
The  stock  has gained 4.9 percent this year.  ‘Encouraging Result’  To help cut the costs of phone subsidies to device makers
for each unit sold at a loss, AT&T increased its upgrade
eligibility period to 20 months from one year in February 2011.  Jonathan Chaplin , a Credit Suisse analyst in New York, said
in a research note today that the lower rate of upgrades “is an
encouraging result -- upgrades and subsidies are the key to
margin expansion and better earnings growth for AT&T.” He rates
the shares neutral.  The U.S. market is nearing saturation after a growth spurt
fueled by sales of the iPhone last year. Wireless penetration in
the U.S. is 105 percent when including mobile devices like
tablet computers, said Bob Roche, a statistician with CTIA, a
wireless-industry trade group.  The slowing market is forcing AT&T into more intense
competition with Verizon Wireless and  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) , with
the carriers fighting over a shrinking pool of people who don’t
yet have mobile phones. They’re also trying to get customers to
upgrade to smartphones such as the iPhone that let users browse
the Web and stream video.  Revenue Increase  Average monthly revenue per AT&T contract subscriber, or
ARPU, increased 1.7 percent to $64.46. Analysts projected
$64.29, the average of eight estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
ARPU growth slowed from 2.4 percent a year earlier and picked up
from 1.4 percent in the fourth quarter.  AT&T’s contract-customer gains were 187,000, compared with
the 189,285 average of eight analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. While the gains were higher than the 62,000 a year
earlier, they declined from the 717,000 customers added in the
fourth quarter.  Verizon Wireless  added 501,000 contract
customers in the first quarter.  The iPhone activations increased from 3.6 million a year
earlier and slowed from a record 7.6 million in the fourth
quarter, when holiday purchases boosted sales.  New sales of the device hurt carriers’ profit margins
initially, because they sell the phone at a loss to lure
subscribers into two-year contracts. Users of the iPhone and
other smartphones are lucrative because they spend more each
month browsing the Web, sending e-mail and watching video.  Wider Margin  Wireless operating income margin widened to 27.2 percent
from 25.8 percent a year earlier. The subsidies for the iPhone,
which carriers buy from Apple for an estimated $600 apiece and
sell to subscribers for hundreds of dollars less, have cut
AT&T’s operating margins from about 30 percent two years ago.  First-quarter net income rose 5.2 percent to $3.58 billion
from $3.41 billion a year earlier.  AT&T’s land-line business added 200,000 U-verse TV
customers, compared with 218,000 a year earlier. New broadband
customers totaled 103,000, compared with 177,000 a year earlier.  AT&T’s first-quarter capital spending rose to $4.3 billion
from $4.2 billion a year earlier. This month, AT&T agreed to
sell its Yellow Pages directory unit to Cerberus Capital
Management LP for $950 million as part of push to jettison
slower-growing businesses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
