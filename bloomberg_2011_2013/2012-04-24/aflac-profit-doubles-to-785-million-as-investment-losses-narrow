Aflac Inc. (AFL) , the world’s biggest
seller of supplemental health insurance, said first-quarter
profit doubled as investment results improved. The shares gained
as the company said it expects 2012  Japan  sales growth of 10
percent, after previously projecting a drop.  Net income  increased to $785 million, or $1.68 a share,
from $389 million, or 83 cents, a year earlier, the Columbus,
Georgia-based company said today in a statement. Operating
profit, which excludes some investment results, was $1.74 a
share, beating the $1.65 average estimate of 19 analysts in a
Bloomberg  survey .  Aflac, which uses a  talking duck  mascot to promote
policies, has said it’s cutting back investments in European
financial firms amid the region’s debt crisis. It hired Eric Kirsch from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in September to manage a
portfolio of about $100 billion.  “The concentration in European financials is
extraordinarily high, although it’s come down,”  Steven Schwartz , a Chicago-based analyst at Raymond James & Associates
Inc., said by phone before the results were announced. Investors
are watching “the investment portfolio in  Europe  and what
they’re planning to do now that this new guy Kirsch is running
the investment operation.”  Realized investment losses were $29 million, compared with
$376 million a year earlier. Book value, a measure of assets
minus liabilities, rose to $29.19 a share as of March 31 from
$27.76 on Dec. 31.  Japan Sales  Aflac gained 4.2 percent to $43.75 at 4:49 p.m. in New York
in extended trading. Aflac had declined 2.9 percent this year on
the New York Stock Exchange, compared with the 7.9 percent gain
of the 24-company  KBW Insurance Index. (KIX)  Results were released
after the close of regular trading.  The insurer said new annualized premium sales in Japan, the
company’s largest market, jumped 54 percent, led by deals
through banks. In dollar terms, new annualized premium sales
were $659 million. Premium income in Japan rose 12 percent to
$4.1 billion.  “The first quarter has positioned us for another strong
year of sales activities in Japan,” Chief Executive Officer Dan Amos said in the statement. Aflac had projected on Jan. 31 that
sales in Japan would drop as much as 5 percent in 2012.  U.S. premium income advanced 5.2 percent to about $1.2
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
