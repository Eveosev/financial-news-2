(Corrects loan size in first and fourth paragraphs.)  Granite Broadcasting Corp., a
television broadcasting provider whose network affiliations
include NBC, CBS, ABC, The CW and My Network TV, set the rate it
will pay on $260.6 million in loans itâ€™s seeking to support debt
repayment, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  The company is proposing to pay interest at 6.5 percentage
points more than the London interbank offered rate on the $215
million, seven-year first-lien portion, with a 1.25 percent
minimum on the lending benchmark, said the person, who declined
to be identified because terms are private.  Granite, based in  New York , may sell the loan at 98.5 cents
on the dollar, said the person, reducing proceeds for the
borrower and boosting the yield for investors.  A $45.6 million second-lien portion may pay interest 15
percentage points more than Libor with a 1.5 percent minimum on
the lending benchmark, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
