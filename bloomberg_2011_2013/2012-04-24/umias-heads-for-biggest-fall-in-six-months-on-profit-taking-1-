Mumias Sugar Co. (MSUG) ,  Kenya ’s biggest
producer of the sweetener, headed for the largest decline in
almost six months as investors took profit from an overbought
level.  The shares dropped 9.5 percent to 5.7 shillings at 11:35
a.m. in Nairobi, the steepest fall since Nov. 7. The stock’s 14-
day relative strength index closed at 93.4 yesterday, according
to data ccompiled by Bloomberg. A reading above 70 means a
security is overvalued and will probably fall. Mumias’ RSI has
been above 70 since April 17.  “Looking at the volumes, we have not seen foreign
investors and local fund managers. So its more of profit taking
by retail investors,” Francis Mwangi, head of research at
Nairobi-based Standard Investment Bank Ltd., said in a phone
interview today.  The shares have rallied 31 percent between yesterday and
April 16, when the company appointed a new chief executive
officer. The Nairobi Securities Exchange Ltd. All Share Index
climbed 3 percent rise in the same period.  Peter Kebati, who joined Mumias in April 2003, will take
over as chief executive from Evans Kidero on July 1, the company
said on its website in a statement dated April 16. Kidero will
depart from the company at the end of its financial year in
June, according to the statement. He is leaving to join
politics, the Daily Nation newspaper reported April 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
