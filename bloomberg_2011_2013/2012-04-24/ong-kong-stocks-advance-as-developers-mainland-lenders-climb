Hong Kong   stocks  rose, with the
benchmark index trimming yesterday’s loss amid lower than
average volume, as property companies and lenders climbed on
speculation China may take measures to support home-buying.  Sino Land Co., controlled by billionaire Robert Ng, led
developers higher, gaining 2.8 percent. Aluminum Corporation of
China Ltd. rose 2.4 percent after agreeing to buy a majority
stake in Winsway Coking Coal Holdings Ltd. at a price Morgan
Stanley said was “reasonable.”  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  rose 0.7 percent to 20,762.01 as of
10:19 a.m. local time, with almost five shares rising for each
that fell. Trading volume on the gauge was about a third below
the 30-day intraday average. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies added 1 percent to 10,920.41.  “Sentiment in the  property market  has been stronger than
expected,” said  Alex Wong , a Hong Kong-based director of asset
management at Ample Capital Ltd., which oversees the equivalent
of $129 million). “We are not very bullish or bearish, in the
meantime we are just stuck in the middle of a range.”  The Hang Seng Index has fallen about 4.3 percent from this
year’s peak on Feb. 29 as China targeted the slowest economic
growth since 2005 and amid speculation the gauge had risen too
fast after an 18 percent advance in the first two months of the
year. Companies on the index trade at an average of 10.5 times
estimated earnings, up from 10 times on Dec. 30 according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) 
trades at 13.1 times.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index rose 0.9 percent to 20,753.
The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  fell 6 percent to 19.27, indicating
traders expect a swing of 5.5 percent in the benchmark over the
next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
