Yields on benchmark 10-year
Treasury notes rose for the first time in a week after the U.S.
sold $35 billion of two-year securities and Federal Reserve
policy makers began a two-day meeting.  The notes drew a yield of 0.270 percent, compared with a
forecast of 0.278 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of nine of
the Fed’s 21 primary dealers, as investors continue to seek the
safest assets. Treasury will sell $35 billion in five-year notes
tomorrow and $29 billion of 10-year debt the next day.  “The market is a tad weaker as we are giving back some of
the recent rally, but we are still at very low yield levels as
the market waits for the Fed,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-
income strategist in Philadelphia at Janney Montgomery Scott
LLC, which oversees $12 billion in Fixed income assets.
“Moderation in the U.S. economic data doesn’t seem to be going
away and no one wants to do much before the Fed has its say
tomorrow.”  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year note rose four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 1.97 percent at 5 p.m. in
 New York , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2
percent note due February 2022 fell 11/32, or $3.44 per $1,000
face amount, to 100 7/32. The  yield  on the current two-year note
rose one basis point to 0.27 percent.  The two-year notes sold today drew a bid-to-cover ratio,
which gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of
securities offered, of 3.76, highest since September, compared
with an average of 3.56 for the past 10 sales.  ‘Lot of Uncertainty’  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 32.1 percent of the notes, compared
with an average of 32.4 percent for the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 7.8 percent of
the notes at the sale, the lowest since February 2011, compared
with an average of 13.5 percent for the past 10 auctions.  Two-year notes have gained 0.1 percent this year, compared
with a 0.2 percent gain for Treasuries overall, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  “The Fed is still on hold and there is a lot of
uncertainty with regard to  Europe  and the economy and that is
keeping demand for Treasuries pretty high,” said  Scott Sherman ,
an interest-rate strategist at primary dealer Credit Suisse
Group AG in New York. “The market is focused on the FOMC, and
we won’t do much either way until that is out of the way.”  Trading Volume  Trading  volume  climbed to $216.7 billion after dropping
April 20 to the lowest level this year, with about $130 billion
of Treasuries changing hands through ICAP Plc, the world’s
largest interdealer broker. The average in 2012 is $249 billion.
Volume reached $439 billion on March 14, the highest since
August.  “People don’t want to short the Treasury market,” said
Paul Horrmann, a broker in New York at Tradition Asiel
Securities Inc., an interdealer broker. “The Fed is still going
to be keeping rates low till 2014. You can’t fight the Fed.” A
short is a bet the price of a security will drop.  Ten-year yields may be in a range of 2 percent to 2.5
percent with the potential to rise to 2.75 percent in 2012,
according to Charles Schwab Corp., which is based in  San
Francisco  and manages $199 billion.  “We don’t anticipate that the Fed will change policy this
year and it seems unlikely at this juncture that they will
engage in more” asset purchases, Kathy A. Jones, a fixed-income
strategist at the company, wrote in an e-mail.  ‘Long’ Bets Drop  Investors in Treasuries reduced expectations that prices of
the securities will climb as the percentage of so-called long
positions dropped in a weekly survey by JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The percent of net longs in the firm’s all-clients survey
dropped to two percentages points, to 23 percent from 25
percent, in the week ended yesterday. The number of outright
neutrals was unchanged at 57 percent. The level of outright
shorts rose to 21 percent from 19 percent the previous week.  The central bank bought $4.8 billion of Treasuries due from
April 2018 to February 2020 today. The purchases are part of the
bank’s effort to replace $400 billion of shorter-term debt in
its holdings with longer maturities to hold down borrowing
costs.  U.S. central bankers bought $2.3 trillion of bonds in two
rounds of so-called quantitative easing between December 2008
and June. They’ve also said they will probably keep their target
for overnight lending between banks at almost zero at least
until late 2014. Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  is scheduled to hold a
press conference tomorrow.  “Everybody is hoping for relief from insight from the
Fed,” said Tradition Asiel’s Horrmann.  To contact the reporter on this story:
