Investors in U.S. Treasuries
reduced expectations that prices of the securities will climb as
the percentage of so-called long positions dropped in a weekly
survey by JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The percent of net longs in the firm’s all-clients survey
dropped to two percentages points in the week ended yesterday.
The number of outright neutrals was unchanged at 57 percent.  The level of outright shorts rose to 21 percent from 19
percent the previous week. JPMorgan doesn’t disclose the number
of clients in the survey.  “It’s a reflection of the balanced outlook for rates,”
said Srini Ramaswamy, a JPMorgan strategist in  New York .
“What’s keeping rates here or what could push rates lower is
the risk of the crisis in  Europe . Except for that risk, rates
should probably be much higher.”  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note rose two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.96 percent at 11:24 a.m.
in New York. The yield touched 2.4 percent on March 20, the
highest since October and has dropped for the past five weeks.
After falling to a record 1.67 percent in September, the yield
traded as low as 1.79 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
