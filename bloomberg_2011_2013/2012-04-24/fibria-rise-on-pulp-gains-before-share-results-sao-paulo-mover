Fibria Celulose SA (FIBR3) , the world’s
largest pulp producer, rallied on rising prices for the raw
material before the release of results of a global share sale.  Fibria increased 6.7 percent to 16 reais at the close in
Sao Paulo, the biggest one-day gain since Aug. 15. The benchmark
Bovespa added 0.7 percent.  “Data helps to make investors more optimistic about future
results of the companies in this industry,” Fausto Gouveia, who
helps manage 380 million reais ($202 million) at Legan
Administracao de Recursos in Sao Paulo, said in a phone
interview.  Hardwood pulp prices have risen because of increased demand
in  China , work stoppages in Europe and operating problems at
some Asia plants, according to Rodrigo Fernandes and Renato
Damaso Maruichi, analysts at Banco Fator in  Sao Paulo .  Fibria plans to sell as many as 91.2 million new voting
shares in a global public offering, according to a prospectus
sent to Brazil’s securities regulator.  Suzano Papel e Celulose , which competes with Fibria,
increased 1.4 percent to 7.50 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
