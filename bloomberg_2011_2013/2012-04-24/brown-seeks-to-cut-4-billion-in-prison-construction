California, which once locked up
more prison inmates than any other state, may slash $4.1 billion
in construction plans, reclaim inmates housed in other states
and close one of its costliest facilities.  That  plan  would reduce general-fund spending on prisons to
7.5 percent from 11 percent, under a blueprint unveiled
yesterday by Governor  Jerry Brown  and the Corrections and
Rehabilitation Department. The $4.1 billion is part of a $7.7
billion bond plan approved in 2007 to build more prison as a way
to ease crowding.  California’s inmate count of about  161,000  last year was
about 175 percent of capacity. The number has dropped to 138,000
after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a lower court’s order to cut
the population because of inadequate health care. Brown and
lawmakers shifted felons convicted of nonviolent, low-level
crimes to county jails or to alternatives such as monitoring by
electronic bracelets.  “California is finally getting its prison costs under
control and taking the necessary steps to meet federal-court
mandates,” Brown said yesterday in a statement. “This plan
cuts billions in future spending and meets the U.S. Supreme
Court’s order.”  As recently as 2008, California’s inmate population was
173,670, the highest in the U.S., followed by Texas at 172,506,
according to a 2010  report  by the Pew Center on the States.  Even with the decline, California prison officials said
they expect to fall short of the court-ordered goal of reducing
inmate numbers to 137.5 percent of capacity in 2013. Corrections
Secretary Matthew Cate told reporters yesterday the state will
ask the court to increase the benchmark to 145 percent, a
difference of 6,000 prisoners.  Prison Bonds  Eliminating $4.1 billion of the bonds authorized would
reduce planned operating costs and debt service by $2.2 billion,
according to the report.  The revised plan also seeks to pull back 10,000 inmates
that were moved to other states to help ease overcrowding, and
to close a prison near Riverside. Combined, those efforts would
reduce the agency’s budget by $1.5 billion a year.  California  usually offers lease-revenue bonds for prison
construction, such as those sold March 22 to help build an
inmate hospital near Stockton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
