Companies’ failure to boost
forecasts for future profits and sales will weigh on the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index as investors project slower growth,
according to  Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s Barry Knapp.  “Guidance is not moving higher and as a result, even where
companies are beating estimates, the stocks still aren’t going
up,” Knapp, the New York-based head of equity strategy at
Barclays, said in a radio interview on “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with Tom Keene. “If the guidance doesn’t move
up, if the revenue’s missed, really what you’re discounting in
terms of the growth outlook is not all that great.”  Knapp cited  United Technologies Corp. (UTX) , which reported
 first-quarter profit  today that topped analysts’ estimates,
while revenue missed projections and the  company’s forecasts  for
2012 were unchanged. The jet engine maker fell 0.1 percent to
$79.68 at 9:55 a.m. in  New York .  The  S&P 500  jumped 8.7 percent this year through yesterday
as concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will derail the global economic
recovery abated and corporate profits exceeded analysts’
estimates. Of the 125 S&P 500 companies that have  posted
earnings  since April 10, 82 percent beat projections. The
benchmark gauge for U.S. stocks fell 3.7 percent from an almost
four-year high on April 2 through yesterday as concern over
Europe resurfaced and U.S. data trailed economists’ forecasts.  Knapp predicts the S&P 500 will end the year at 1,330, 4
percent below the average forecast of 11 strategists surveyed by
Bloomberg as of April 16. He forecasts combined profit by S&P
500 companies will be $103 a share this year. Analysts that
cover companies in the index  estimate  earnings of $104.86 in
2012 and $118.06 in 2013, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  S&P 500 Valuation  The S&P 500 currently trades at 14 times profit in the past
year and 13 times earnings in the next 12 months, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  “If the stock market has a huge rally into earnings
season, undoubtedly investors have started to discount much
better results,” Knapp said today. “A stock, of course, is a
stream of future earnings. If those future earnings aren’t
moving higher, then it’s just not enough to push the stock
prices up. That’s at the core of why these individual stocks
have not performing well even when they beat estimates.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
