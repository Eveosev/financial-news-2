South Korean  consumer confidence 
rose to the highest level in almost a year as improving signs
for the  U.S. economy  and European debt crisis offset worries
over North Korea.  The  sentiment index  was at 104 in April, the strongest
since May 2011, rising from 101 in March, the Bank of Korea said
in an e-mailed statement today. A reading above 100 indicates
optimists outnumber pessimists.  The expected inflation rate over the next year was 3.8
percent in April, below last month’s 3.9 percent, today’s report
showed.  The consumer confidence index is based on survey responses
from 2,052 households in 56 cities. It was conducted by mail and
telephone between April 12 and 18.  South Korea ’s won rebounded from a three-month low and
stocks rallied right after a long-range rocket launched by North
Korea failed on April 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
