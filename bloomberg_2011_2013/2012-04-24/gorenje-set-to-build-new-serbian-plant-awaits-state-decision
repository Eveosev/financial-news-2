Gorenje Group d.d ., Slovenia’s
biggest appliance maker, said it’s close to a decision on
expanding its Serbian production and may soon sign agreement
with the government that will support its 20 million-euro ($26.4
million) investment.  The new factory in the western Serbian city of Valjevo, 100
kilometers (60 miles) southwest of Belgrade, will produce
cooling appliances that are “bigger and of higher value” than
those made at the facility, Chief Executive Officer Franjo Bobinac told reporters today.  “Our decision to start a new plant is almost final,”
Bobinac said. “We just need to reach a final agreement with the
authorities” on infrastructure and other support, he said.  President  Boris Tadic , the leader of  Serbia ’s ruling
Democratic Party, pledged support for “this type of
investment” at a campaign stop in the area today ahead of May 6
elections. Gorenje currently has three production facilities in
Serbia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
