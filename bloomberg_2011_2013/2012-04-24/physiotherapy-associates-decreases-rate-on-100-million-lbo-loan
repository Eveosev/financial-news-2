Physiotherapy Associates Inc., a
provider of outpatient rehabilitation services, cut the  interest
rate  on a $100 million  term loan  B it’s seeking to back the
company’s buyout by Court Square Capital Partners, according to
a person with knowledge of the transaction.  The six-year debt will pay interest at 4.75 percentage
points more than the London interbank offered rate, down from 5
percentage points, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the terms are private. Libor, a rate banks
say they can borrow in dollars from each other, will have a 1.25
percent floor.  Physiotherapy Associates is proposing to sell the loan at
98 cents on the dollar, the person said, reducing proceeds for
the company and boosting the yield to investors.  Jefferies Group Inc. is arranging the financing for the
Exton, Pennsylvania-based company and investors have until 5
p.m. today in  New York  to submit commitment, according to the
person.  Trevor Gibbons, a spokesman for Court Square, declined to
comment.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan it can’t. So-called B loans are
mainly bought by non-bank lenders such as collateralized loan
obligations, mutual funds and  hedge funds .  To contact the reporter on this story:
