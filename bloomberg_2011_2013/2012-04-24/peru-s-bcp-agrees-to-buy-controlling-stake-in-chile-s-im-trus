Banco de Credito del Peru (CREDITC1) , the
Andean country’s biggest bank, agreed to buy a majority stake in
Chilean brokerage IM Trust as the two countries integrate their
financial services industries and  capital markets .  The unit of  Credicorp Ltd. (BAP) , Peru’s largest financial
services company, will buy at least a 60.6 percent shareholding
in a deal that’s subject to due diligence and regulatory
approval, Banco de Credito said in a regulatory filing.  Colombian, Peruvian and Chilean financial firms are
expanding in the region, while the three countries develop Latin
America’s first stock market combination, as economic growth
spurs demand for securities. Banco de Credito agreed in December
to buy 51 percent of Colombia’s Correval SA to expand its
brokerage and corporate finance businesses.  “This alliance will cover the financial needs of investors
and corporations in the markets with the largest potential in
the region, where the combined GDP reached an estimated $800
billion at the end of 2011,” Credicorp said in a separate
statement.  Banco de Credito didn’t disclose the deal’s price in
today’s statement. Credicorp shares fell 2.4 percent to $127.98
in  Lima  yesterday, reducing a year-to-date gain to 17 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
