The following table details 
the Federal Old-Age and Survivors, Disability, and Health
Insurance trust funds (OASDI) as reported by the Social 
Security Administration Board of Trustees Annual Report.   From 2012 to 2021, the Board of Trustees expects $1,186.9
billion in interest income in 2012 CPI-indexed dollars.
Excluding this interest income, as indicated in the table below,
the Trust Funds have a negative balance. Non-interest income
consists of payroll tax contributions, proceeds from taxation of 
OASDI benefits and reimbursements from the General Fund of the
Treasury, if any. In 2012, it is projected that the General Fund
of the Treasury will have to transfer $53 billion to the OASDI Fund.  Note: numbers in billions, intermediate cost scenario
