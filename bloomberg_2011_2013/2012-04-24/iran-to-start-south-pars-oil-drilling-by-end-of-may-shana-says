Iran ’s Pars Oil & Gas Co. will
start drilling the oil layer of the South Pars gas fields by the
end of May, the Oil Ministry’s news website reported.  A drilling rig will be dispatched to parts of the field
Iran shares with its neighbors by May 21, the company’s Managing
Director Mousa Souri said in the article published by  Shana 
yesterday. The company is negotiating with a group next week to
buy or lease a floating storage vessel, he said.  The Persian Gulf state aims to start oil production from
the South Pars layer at the end of the current Iranian year on
March 20, Souri said. Some $800 million of investment is needed
to develop the layer, and initial production is estimated at
35,000 oil barrels a day, he said.  Iran plans to produce 850,000 barrels a day from fields it
shares with Iraq and Qatar by 2015, the director of combined
planning at National Iranian Oil Co., Abdol-Majid Delparish,
said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
