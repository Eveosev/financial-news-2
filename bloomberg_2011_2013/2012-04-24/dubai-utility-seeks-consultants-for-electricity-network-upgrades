Dubai Electricity and Water
Authority, the Persian Gulf emirateâ€™s utility, is seeking
consultants to develop a strategy to upgrade its power network,
allowing for better efficiency and use of renewable resources.  DEWA, as the utility is known, is seeking proposals by May
17 on plans to implement so-called smart grids, it said in an e-
mailed statement today. Smart grids allow electricity networks
to transmit information on usage, prices and other data that can
help utilities and consumers cut demand and better integrate
renewable energy sources like solar power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
