The first live question
 International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)  Chief Executive Officer
Virginia “Ginni” Rometty faced at today’s shareholder meeting
was if Georgia’s Augusta National Golf Club had admitted her as
a member.  IBM is one of the sponsors of the  Masters Tournament , held
at Augusta National, where no woman has been offered membership
since its founding eight decades ago. Historically, the club has
offered a membership to the CEO of IBM, allowing him to don the
club’s green member blazer.  “I’m certainly very happy about our CEO and be anxious to
know if she’s a member of Augusta?” the unidentified male
shareholder asked at the meeting in North Charleston,  South
Carolina . “No response is required,” he added.  Rometty, 54, didn’t answer while the room was filled with
laughter. Chairman  Sam Palmisano , standing next to her on the
stage, thanked the shareholder for the “very kind comment.”  “We were all curious as to when that would come up,”
Palmisano said. “But thank you again. Can I have another
question please?”  Bloomberg News revived the debate when it reported on March
28 the conflict between Augusta’s men-only membership policy and
Rometty. The first Masters Tournament after Rometty’s promotion
to IBM’s CEO was held earlier this month. The club and Armonk,
New York-based IBM have declined to comment on the issue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
