Novartis AG (NOVN) ’s Tasigna and Glivec
drugs won the backing of the U.K.’s health-cost agency for use
against a rare blood cancer in final treatment guidelines.  The  National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence 
rejected a competing product,  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) ’s
Sprycel, for use in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, the
agency said in a statement today. The agency advises the
National Health Service on which medicines represent value for
money.  Novartis offered a price cut that allowed a recommendation
for Tasigna, and the Basel, Switzerland-based company asked that
the discount be kept confidential, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
