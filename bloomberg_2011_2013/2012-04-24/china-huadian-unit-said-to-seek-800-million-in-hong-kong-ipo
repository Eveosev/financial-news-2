Fuxin New Energy Co., the renewable
power unit of China Huadian Corp., may raise as much as $800
million in an initial public offering in Hong Kong, said two
people with knowledge of the matter.  Fuxin, based in  Fujian province , expects to start trading
by the third quarter, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the information is private. Bank of America
Corp., Citic Securities International Co., Citigroup Inc. and
UBS AG will manage the sale, they said.  Fuxin gained approval to seek a listing from the Ministry
of Environmental Protection in November, according to a
 statement  on the ministry’s website. Fuxin includes China
Huadian’s Fujian unit and a Beijing subsidiary that operates
wind and solar power plants, another  statement  shows.  A call to China Huadian’s media relations office in Beijing
went unanswered. China Huadian, among the country’s top five
power producers, had 94.1 gigawatts of generating capacity at
the end of last year, according to the company’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
