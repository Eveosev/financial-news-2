Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  said the
country will maintain steady growth even amid signs the world’s
second-largest economy is slowing.  “ China  has confidence that it will sustain steady and
robust economic growth,” Wen said today at a press conference
in Stockholm with Swedish Prime Minister  Fredrik Reinfeldt ,
according to an English translation of his remarks. “China will
remain committed to reform and opening up.”  A leading index for China rose at a slower pace in March,
adding to evidence growth in the world’s second-biggest economy
is moderating. The gauge rose 0.8 percent from the prior month
to 230.6, the New York-based Conference Board said in a
statement today in Beijing, citing a preliminary reading. That
compares with a 1 percent rise in February that was revised from
a reported 0.8 percent increase.  The data may add pressure on policy makers to take more
measures to support expansion after the economy grew the least
in almost three years. China’s slowdown may cloud the outlook
for a global recovery after U.S. job gains weakened and the
euro-area’s fiscal crisis threatened to spread.  The Chinese leader is on a European trip that included
stops in Iceland and  Germany , and takes him to Poland this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
