(Corrects revenue figure in final paragraph in story
published yesterday.)  Russia ’s  Finance Ministry  is asking
lawmakers to raise the limit on outstanding foreign debt by $8.1
billion after selling Eurobonds in the biggest emerging-market
sovereign offering since 2009.  Foreign debt can’t exceed $56.5 billion on Jan. 1, 2013,
from the $48.4 billion cap set in the current plan, according to
proposed changes to the 2012 budget, posted on the Moscow-based
ministry’s website. The domestic debt limit would fall to 5.46
trillion rubles ($186.4 billion) from 6.33 trillion rubles.  Russia, which gets about half its revenue from oil and gas,
is benefiting from higher  energy prices  as tensions in the
Middle East escalate, stoking concern over possible supply
disruptions. Since the budget may be almost balanced, the
strategy of selling more costly ruble-denominated bonds to build
up the  Reserve Fund  “doesn’t make much sense,” said  Clemens Grafe , chief economist at  Goldman Sachs in  Moscow.  “What they’re trying to do is say: look, rather than going
down that route, if we want to rebuild the oil fund, then let’s
do it with foreign borrowing,” Grafe said today in a phone
interview. “Legally, this would allow them to do that.”  Gross domestic product may grow to 60.6 trillion rubles in
2012, compared with an earlier estimate of 58.7 trillion rubles,
the ministry said. The  budget deficit  may be 0.1 percent of GDP
rather than an initially planned 1.5 percent, according to draft
amendments.  The ministry projects revenue will be 12.68 trillion rubles
this year, 7.6 percent higher than its earlier target, according
to the bill. Spending may be 0.7 percent more than planned at
12.75 trillion rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
