Wegelin & Co., the 270-year-old
Swiss bank charged with helping U.S. taxpayers hide more than
$1.2 billion from the  Internal Revenue Service , was ordered by a
U.S. judge to forfeit $16 million.  U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain in Manhattan
yesterday entered a default judgment against Wegelin, allowing
the government to take the money in Wegelin’s correspondent
account in the U.S., held at UBS AG in Stamford, Connecticut.  Wegelin, based in  St. Gallen ,  Switzerland , and three
bankers at its Zurich branch were indicted in February on
charges of conspiring with clients to evade U.S. taxes.
Prosecutors called Wegelin a “fugitive” after the bank
declined to send a lawyer or other representative to a court
hearing in the case.  Prosecutors claimed that Wegelin and at least two other
Swiss banks used the UBS account to launder money deposited by
U.S. taxpayers to help them avoid detection by the government.
Wegelin didn’t take any action to challenge the government’s
claim to the money, prosecutors from the office of Manhattan
U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said yesterday in a statement.  Albena Bjorck, a spokeswoman for Wegelin, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment yesterday after
regular business hours in Switzerland.  The case is U.S. v. All Funds on Deposit at  UBS AG (UBSN) ,
Account No. 101-WA-358967-000, Held in the Name of Wegelin &
Co., 12-cv-00836, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New
York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
