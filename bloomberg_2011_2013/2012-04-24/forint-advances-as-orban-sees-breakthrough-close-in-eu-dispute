The forint gained after Prime
Minister  Viktor Orban  said the country was close to a
“breakthrough” in its bid to convince the European Union and
the  International Monetary Fund  to allow aid talks to start.  Hungary ’s currency appreciated 0.6 percent to 297.76 per
euro by 2:14 p.m. in Budapest after retreating to the weakest
close in three months yesterday. Hungary’s central bank kept its
benchmark rate at 7 percent for a fourth month today, in line
with the expectations of all 24 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News.  The European Commission will decide tomorrow whether it
will allow Hungary’s bailout talks to proceed, Orban told
reporters in Brussels today. The delay in the talks on the aid,
which Orban requested five months ago, isn’t allowing the Magyar
Nemzeti Bank to ease monetary policy, Brown Brothers Harriman
said.  “The bank’s bias is towards cutting, given the expected
headwinds to the economy this year, but no action will be taken
until an IMF deal is secured,” Ilan Solot, an emerging-market
strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in  London , and
colleagues wrote in a research report before the central bank
decision.  Orban said the euro region’s executive arm will probably
decide to file lawsuits against Hungary on some disputed issues,
including the government’s decision to cut the central bank
governor’s salary.  To contact the reporter on this story:
