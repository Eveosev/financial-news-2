Singapore  may introduce additional
measures to cool the housing market after private home sales
reached a record in the first quarter as more “shoebox”
apartments were sold, property services company Jones Lang
LaSalle Inc. and brokerages including Nomura Holdings Inc. said.  Home sales climbed to 6,682 units in the three months ended
March 31, the highest quarterly figure since 1996 when the  Urban
Redevelopment Authority  began reporting the data. Prices rose
1.2 percent for the mass market in the same period, preliminary
estimates from the authority showed earlier this month.  Singapore has been attempting to rein in prices since 2009,
when the government barred interest-only loans for some housing
projects and stopped allowing developers to absorb interest
payments for apartments still being built. Analysts at  Jones
Lang , CLSA Asia Pacific Markets, Nomura and Bank of America
Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit all expect the government to
introduce further measures to curb price increases.  The volume and price increases “suggest that there could
be some policy measures,” Chua Yang Liang, head of research for
 Southeast Asia  at Jones Lang’s Singapore unit, said in a
telephone interview. “The policy risk is high. If they do
implement, they could do it in four to six weeks as they are
quite quick to react.”  Smaller Unit Sales  Sales have risen as developers offer smaller units,
according to CBRE Group Inc. The median size of apartments
declined 24 percent to 667 square feet in the quarter ended
March from the previous three months while the median price slid
18 percent to S$786,340, it said.  Foreigners and corporate entities have to pay an additional
10 percent stamp duty following measures introduced in December.
The extra levy is 3 percent for permanent residents purchasing a
second home and for citizens buying their third residential
property.  The next round of cooling measures will be targeted at
curbing investment demand from Singaporeans, CLSA, a unit of
Credit Agricole SA, said in a report dated April 17. The
evidence of strong investor demand can be seen in the
overwhelming response to “shoebox developments,” according to
the CLSA report.  “We believe the government could potentially introduce
further cooling measures should the positive trend persist,”
analysts Melinda Baxter and Xin Yan Low at Merrill Lynch said in
a note to clients dated April 16.  Merrill Lynch forecasts prices will fall 12.5 percent this
year and recommends investors avoid exposure to residential
developers.  Hong Kong Contrast  Among the measures Jones Lang’s Chua expects is a change in
taxes for Singaporean buyers of second and third homes. Locals
have to pay a 10 percent tax if they are buying their third
property, while permanent residents need to pay the levy for the
second property and foreigners are liable for the duty on their
first-home purchase, according to Chua.  The government may “fine tune it where they may ask
Singaporean buyers, who own more than two properties, to pay the
higher tax,” Chua said. “But I don’t think they will take any
measures that will affect first-time buyers.”  Concerns of an oversupply of smaller units in Singapore are
in contrast to  Hong Kong  where the government has tried to
increase the supply of smaller units on concerns that rising
home prices are making properties unaffordable.  Hong Kong home prices have gained more than 70 percent
since early 2009. An apartment that is less than 100 square
meters (1,076 square feet) in size would be defined as a smaller
unit.  Taxes Weigh  Not all expect tighter real estate policies are imminent in
Singapore. The government will wait for a quarter or two before
it reacts to the latest sales data and introduce any new
measures, Chor Hoon Chua, head of Asia Pacific research at DTZ
Holdings Plc’s Singapore unit, said.  Singapore home prices fell for the first time in almost
three years after the government imposed new taxes on house
purchases. The island-state’s private residential property price
index declined 0.1 percent to 206 points in the quarter ended
March 31 from the previous three months, according to
preliminary estimates from the government on April 1.  Sales to foreigners fell by 74 percent in the quarter ended
March 31 from a year earlier, Jones Lang said, citing URA data.
Sales to Singaporeans declined by 12 percent from a year ago,
according to the data.  Expectations that more cooling measures will be introduced
may prompt “developers to continue to push out more projects,”
DTZ’s Chua said in an e-mail. New projects including  Sky Habitat ,
designed by architect  Moshe Safdie , as well as Hillsta, Katong
Regency and EON Shenton will drive sales, she said.  Singapore’s private home sales this year may exceed 2011
after the first quarter ended with record purchases, according
to DTZ, the London-based real estate advisory business acquired
by UGL Ltd., a Sydney-based engineering and property services
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
