United Technologies Corp. (UTX)  said
first-quarter profit exceeded analysts’ estimates as earnings at
its climate, controls and security unit increased and the
company received a larger tax settlement than it predicted from
the U.S. government.  Earnings from continuing operations rose to $1.18 billion,
or $1.31 a share, from $967 million, or $1.06, a year earlier,
the Hartford, Connecticut-based company said in a statement
today. That exceeded the $1.20  average  of 22 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. The tax benefit and other one-time items added 30
cents a share to profit.  Chief Executive Officer Louis Chenevert is remaking United
Technologies by jettisoning units that make rocket engines, wind
turbines and air compressors and reorganizing the climate
controls and security unit before completing a $16.5 billion
acquisition of  Goodrich Corp. (GR)  this year. Climate, controls and
security profit climbed 15 percent to $544 million, while
earnings at  Hamilton Sundstrand  rose to $198 million.  “The room for an operational surprise comes from better-
than-expected performance out of the climate and controls
business,”  Peter Arment , an analyst at Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.
in New York, said in a telephone interview before the
announcement. “Because of the tax gain, the bottom-line number,
in terms of earnings per share, isn’t a clean number.”  Revenue fell 2 percent to $12.4 billion in the quarter,
missing analysts’ estimates of $12.8 billion.  A settlement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service
resulted in a $203 million gain in the quarter,  United
Technologies  said.  United Technologies affirmed a  forecast  made last month for
2012 profit of $5.30 to $5.50 a share and revenue of $61 billion
to $62 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
