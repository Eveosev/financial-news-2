Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB) , the
United Arab Emirates’ third-biggest lender, posted a 38 percent
increase in first-quarter profit as impairment provisions
declined and net interest income grew.  Net income advanced to 802 million dirhams ($218 million)
from 583 million dirhams a year earlier, the lender said in a
statement today. That beat the 612 million-dirham  median
estimate  of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Net interest
income and Islamic financing revenue rose 29 percent to 1.2
billion dirhams.  U.A.E. banks are recovering after the global financial
crisis slowed lending, hurt  investment banking  and led to an
increase in bad loans.  National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC (NBAD) , the
U.A.E.’s second-biggest bank by assets, today posted a 12
percent increase in first-quarter profit, while  First Gulf Bank
PJSC (FGB) , a lender owned by Abu Dhabi’s ruling family, reported
yesterday a 7 percent rise in profit to 935 million dirhams.  Net impairment allowance charges dropped 28 percent to 287
million dirhams from 399 million dirhams a year earlier, ADCB
said in the statement. The ratio of non-performing loans to
gross loans increased to 5.5 percent at the end of March from
4.6 percent at the end of December.  Gross lending slipped 1 percent to 129.8 billion dirhams in
March from 130.5 billion dirhams in December, while deposits
rose 4 percent to 114.5 billion dirhams, it said.  Moody’s Investors Service Inc. today changed ADCB’s outlook
to stable from negative to reflect “continued improvement in
the bank’s financial fundamentals since 2009” and its improved
funding profile.  The shares stock  fell  1 percent to 3.13 dirhams yesterday
and have risen 13 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
