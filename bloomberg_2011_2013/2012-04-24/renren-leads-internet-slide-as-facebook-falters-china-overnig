Chinese  Internet stocks  slumped in
the U.S. on speculation declining profit for  Facebook Inc. (FB)  and
 Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s drop to a six-week low signal that the information
technology sector is faltering.  Renren Inc. (RENN) , a Chinese social networking website, fell the
most in more than two months, while  China ’s biggest online
search engine  Baidu Inc. (BIDU)  slid to the lowest since March 7 and
extended declines after normal trading hours after forecasting
second-quarter sales growth below analysts’ estimates. The
 Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded Chinese
shares in the U.S. sank 0.3 percent to 100.63 in in  New York .  Facebook, the world’s largest social network site, said
yesterday that net income in the first three months of 2012 slid
12 percent as revenue growth slowed and marketing costs more
than doubled. Shares of Apple, the maker of iPhones and iPads,
extended a five-day drop to 8.1 percent before reporting a
doubling in earnings. Renren has surged 78 percent in 2012 and
Baidu has climbed 17 percent, beating an 11 percent gain in the
gauge of U.S.-listed Chinese companies.  “Technology stocks have been trading weaker lately as
Apple’s stock dropped and Facebook’s profit decline may also
have added to concern about the sector,” Jeff Papp, a senior
analyst at Oberweis Asset Management Inc. in Lisle,  Illinois ,
which manages $700 million of assets including Chinese stocks,
said by phone yesterday.  Apple slipped for a fifth day, falling 2 percent to
$560.28. After markets closed, the company reported that net
income in the fiscal second quarter climbed to $11.6 billion,
reflecting strong demand for the iPhone in China as well as
purchases of a new version of the iPad tablet.  China ETF Climbs  The  IShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S. rose for the fifth time in six
days, climbing 0.5 percent to $37.19. The  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index (SPX)  gained 0.4 percent to 1,371.97 as new U.S. home sales in
March came in stronger than economists estimated and company
earnings from AT&T Inc. to 3M Co. exceeded analysts’ forecasts.  Renren’s American depositary receipts sank 6.6 percent, the
biggest decline since Feb. 1, to $6.32 yesterday.  ADRs of Beijing-based Baidu fell 2.7 percent to $135.83 in
New York yesterday. After the close of U.S. markets, Baidu
 reported  that first-quarter profit rose 76 percent, meeting
analyst estimates, as spending by bigger customers fueled higher
sales of online advertising.  Revenue is expected to rise to between 5.34 billion yuan
($847 million) and 5.46 billion yuan in the second quarter,
Baidu said in a statement yesterday. That compares with a 5.48
billion yuan average of analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  After-Hours Slump  Baidu slid a further 12 percent in  after-hours  ADR trading
to $121.40 by 5:30 p.m. in New York.  E-Commerce Dangdang Inc., known as Dangdang, dropped for a
third day, retreating 7.2 percent to $7.50, the lowest level in
almost a month. The declines trimmed 2012 gains for the nation’s
biggest online book seller to 70 percent.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  was little changed at 2,388.83
yesterday, while the  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of
Chinese companies traded in  Hong Kong  was also steady at
10,817.16.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s biggest offshore oil explorer, said in
a statement yesterday that revenue rose 3.7 percent to 48.84
billion yuan in the first quarter as higher crude prices
countered a 6.3 percent drop in production after oil spills shut
China’s largest field in September. The Beijing-based company,
which gets almost all its income from oil and gas production,
didn’t report first-quarter earnings.  China Eastern Boost  Cnooc’s ADRs slipped 0.7 percent to $203.71 in New York,
falling for a third day. The company’s Hong Kong stock dropped
0.3 percent yesterday to HK$15.96, or $2.06 per share. Each ADR
represents 100 underlying shares in the company.  China Eastern Airlines Corp. (CEA)  climbed the most in four
months in U.S. trading as  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  said it
expects the country’s second-largest carrier by passengers to
make a “small profit” in the first quarter.  China Eastern , scheduled to report its earnings for the
first three months of 2012 on April 27, jumped 5.1 percent to
$15.42, the biggest one-day advance since Dec. 16. Shares  traded 
in Hong Kong rose 4.8 percent to $HK2.40 (31 U.S. cents).  Goldman reiterated its buy rating on China Eastern as
analysts led by Hino Lam said investors “may have turned too
bearish” on the shares after the company said on April 13 that
first-quarter profit probably fell more than 50 percent because
of slower economic growth and higher fuel prices.  China Auto Rental Holdings Inc. (CARH) , striving to become the
second Chinese company to undertake an initial public offering
in the U.S. this year, may raise less than planned after
struggling to attract investors, said two people with knowledge
of the situation said yesterday, declining to be identified as
the deliberations were in progress.  The car-rental company may reduce the price sought as only
about half the order book for the initial public offering was
covered early yesterday, the people said. China Auto is offering
11 million ADRs for $10.50 to $12.50 each, regulatory filings
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
