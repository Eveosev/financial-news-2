Morocco ’s 2012 cereal harvest will
be 4.8 million metric tons after drought and cold weather
affected crops, the Agriculture Ministry said.  A low amount of rain and cold temperatures affected the
grain crop this year, Ichrak Moubsit, ministry spokeswoman,
wrote in an e-mail today. About 8 million tons were harvested in
2011.  Morocco may import the most wheat in at least 50 years in
the 12 months beginning in July after rain delayed planting and
cold curbed crop development, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s Foreign Agricultural Service said in a report last
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
