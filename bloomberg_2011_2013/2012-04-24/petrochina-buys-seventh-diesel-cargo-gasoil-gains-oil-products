PetroChina Co. bought a  diesel 
cargo in northwest Europe, its seventh this month. Gasoil rose
as much as 1 percent on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
London as lower temperatures boosted demand for the heating oil.  Gasoline barges advanced while the fuel’s crack, or premium
to  Brent crude , increased.  Light Products  Gasoline barges for loading in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp
traded from $1,092 to $1,100 a metric ton, according to a survey
of brokers and traders monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board. That
compares with deals yesterday from $1,082 to $1,096.  Morgan Stanley was the biggest seller of the Eurobob grade
to which ethanol is added to make finished fuel. North Sea Group
was the main buyer. Barge lots are typically for 1,000 tons or
2,000 tons.  Gasoline’s  crack  increased to $11.78 a barrel as of 2:18
p.m. local time, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd.,
a London-based broker. That compares with $11.24 yesterday.  Middle Distillates  PetroChina purchased as much as 30,000 tons of ultra-low-
sulfur diesel from Royal Dutch Shell Plc at a premium of $27 a
ton to May gasoil for delivery to Lavera in southern  France ,
according to a similar survey of the Platts pricing window,
which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. That’s $1 less than a trade
on April 18.  Diesel  barges  traded at premiums of $16 and $17 a ton to
May gasoil, according to the survey. That compares with
yesterday’s deals at $15 to $17.  A barge of  jet fuel  changed hands at $66 a ton more than
May gasoil, in line with yesterday, the survey showed.  Gasoil for May delivery gained 0.7 percent to $996.25 a ton
as of 5:20 p.m. London time on the ICE exchange. The June gasoil
contract was at $992.25, the same discount to front-month
futures as yesterday.  Temperatures in Bonn, Germany,  Europe ’s largest heating oil
market, are forecast to fall to a low of 3 degrees Celsius (37
Fahrenheit) tomorrow from 8 degrees today, according to data by
CustomWeather Inc.  Gasoil’s  crack , a measure of refining profitability, fell 2
cents to $14.98 a barrel. Brent crude declined 0.4 percent to
$118.24 a barrel.  Residues  High-sulfur  fuel oil  traded at $682 to $686 a ton, the
survey of Platts showed. That compares with yesterday’s deals at
$673.25 to $674.50.  Refineries  Repsol YPF SA is starting crude unit 2 and platformer P2
today at its 220,000 barrel-a-day Petronor refinery in Bilbao,
 Spain , according to a statement on the refinery’s website.
Platformers make blending components for gasoline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
