Bank of England  policy maker  David Miles  said that Britain’s housing market is going through a
“painful” transition and it’s highly unlikely that conditions
will return to pre-crisis levels.  “Where we were in the years before the crisis was in
retrospect completely unsustainable,” he said in an interview
in London yesterday. “If you go from that situation to
something that is going to be more sane and sustainable, that
transition is going to be very painful.”  The U.K. housing market has seen a drop in the number of
home sales as banks grant  fewer mortgages  and demand higher
deposits, while the lack of supply helps support home values.
Miles said it will take time for Britons to adjust to the fact
that they needed to build up deposits of 15 or 20 percent,
rather than borrowing the full value of a property.  “The level of transactions is dramatically lower than it
was in the years leading up to the financial mess” and “net
new mortgage lending remains very weak,” said Miles. “It’s a
response to a movement from an unsustainable position,
ultimately to something a bit more sustainable.”  Miles said that “one should anticipate a relatively slow
transition back to normal in terms of transactions,” and that
it isn’t “at all desirable or at all likely that we get back to
the situation we were in, the bad old days.”  -- Editors: Craig Stirling, Eddie Buckle  To contact the reporters on this story:
