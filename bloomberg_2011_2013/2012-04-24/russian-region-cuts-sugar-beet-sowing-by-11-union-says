Farmers in  Russia ’s Krasnodar
region finished sugar-beet sowing, planting 118,000 hectares
(291,584 acres), or 11 percent less than a year earlier, the
country’s Sugar Producers Union  said  on its website.  The sowing area declined as farmers used technology to
increase beet yields by 17 percent and to fit local refining
capacities, the union said. Krasnodar plans to harvest 8 million
to 8.5 million metric tons of beets in 2012, it said.  The region accounted for about 20 percent of Russia’s
sugar-beet crop last year after it harvested 9.3 million tons,
according to state statistics office data.  Russia’s total sugar-beet sowing reached 311,200 hectares
as of yesterday, about 27 percent of the targeted area, the
union said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
