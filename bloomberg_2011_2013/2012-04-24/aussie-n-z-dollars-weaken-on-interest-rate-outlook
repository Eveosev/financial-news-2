The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars fell against most of their major peers after slowing
consumer-price inflation in Australia increased bets the
nation’s central bank will lower  interest rates .  The Aussie dollar touched a two-week low against its U.S.
counterpart even as global stocks and commodities rose following
better-than-expected U.S. economic data and successful bond
auctions in Europe. Both South Pacific currencies weakened for a
second day versus the greenback.  “Commodity currencies have been a bit softer because you
had a weak Australian CPI number overnight,” said  Geoff Kendrick , head of European currency strategy at Nomura
International Plc, by phone from  London . “The big picture
driver is likely to be growth this year.”  The Australian dollar dropped as much as 0.7 percent to
$1.0247 yesterday in  New York , the lowest level since April 11,
before trading little changed at $1.0315. The Aussie rose 0.1
percent to 83.88 yen after sliding 1.1 percent earlier.  New Zealand’s dollar was little changed at 81.32 U.S. cents
after falling earlier as much as 0.5 percent. It rose 0.1
percent to 66.12 yen.  Australia’s  consumer price index  rose 0.1 percent from the
previous quarter, the Bureau of Statistics said yesterday in
Sydney, compared with a 0.6 percent gain forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey. It was unchanged in the fourth quarter.  The  Reserve Bank  of Australia has signaled it may be
willing to lower its benchmark interest rate from 4.25 percent
to bolster the economy, provided prices remain in check. A
Credit Suisse Group AG  index  based on swaps indicates traders
expect 109 basis points, or 1.09 percentage points, of cuts over
the next 12 months, compared with 98 points yesterday.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 (SPX)  Index advanced as much as 0.6
percent before trimming the gain to 0.4 percent, and the Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials added 0.3 percent.
Yields on Spanish, Italian and Dutch bonds fell after the
nations sold debt yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
