Argentina ’s soybean harvest may be
lower than estimated a week ago because of “severe” crop
losses in the country’s north, Oil World said.  Production of the oilseed may come to 42 million to 43
million metric tons this year, down as much as 15 percent from a
year earlier and less than the 44 million estimated last week,
the Hamburg-based researcher said in a report today. Northern
provinces including Chaco and Tucuman are having the worst
drought in about 50 years, and as much as 900,000 hectares (2.2
million acres) may be abandoned nationwide, it said.  The reduced forecast “is mainly on account of severe crop
losses in the north, from where we have just received
additional, very alarming reports,” Oil World said. “Harvest
results so far show unusually small yields in northern
Argentina.”  The South American country is the world’s third-largest
soybean exporter after the U.S. and  Brazil .  To contact the reporter on this story:
