U.K. police arrested five men
between 21 and 35 years old as part of an anti-terrorism
investigation today.  All five were arrested at homes as part of a pre-planned,
intelligence-led operation and are still in custody in a central
 London  police station, the Metropolitan Police said in an e-
mailed statement.  “Officers from the Counter Terrorism Command have today,
Tuesday 24 April, arrested five men on suspicion of the
commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism,”
the department said.  Five homes in Luton, north of London, are being searched in
connection with the inquiry, police said.  In an unrelated case, London police charged two 24-year-old
men over a terror plot earlier this month. The men appeared in
Westminster Magistrates Court charged with offenses under
British terror laws, police said at the time.  Last week, the U.K.’s effort to deport the Islamic cleric
known as Abu Qatada to  Jordan  to face trial on terrorism charges
was blocked by the  European Court  of Human Rights until judges
there decide whether to again take up his case.  To contact the reporter on this story:
