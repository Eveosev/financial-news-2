The cost of insuring corporate
bonds in Japan and  Australia  against non-payment increased,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index rose 1 basis point to 177
basis points as of 9:36 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The index is on track to close at its highest level since
Jan. 19, CMA prices show.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index advanced 2 basis points
to 161.5 as of 10:50 a.m. in Sydney, according to  Westpac
Banking Corp. (WBC)  The measure has traded between 128.2 and 182.8
this year, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc.
and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  declined 2 basis points to 169 as of
8:39 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices
show. The index has increased from 159.6 at the end of last
month, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
