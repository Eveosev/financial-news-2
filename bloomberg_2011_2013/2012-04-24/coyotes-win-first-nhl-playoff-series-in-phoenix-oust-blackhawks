The  Phoenix Coyotes  won their first
National Hockey League playoff series since relocating to
Arizona from Winnipeg in 1996, advancing to the second round
with a 4-0 win over the Chicago Blackhawks.  It was the first game in the best-of-seven series that
wasn’t decided in overtime, with the Coyotes, the third seed in
the Western Conference, winning four games to two.  “It’s the first step of what we want to do,” said Coyotes
captain Shane Doan, who has been with the organization since its
final season in Winnipeg in 1995-96. “It’s been a little lean
for a long time and to get out of that first round is big.”  Phoenix goaltender  Mike Smith  made 39 saves for the shutout,
while Oliver Ekman-Larsson snapped a scoreless game with a
power-play goal 13 minutes, 14 seconds into the second period
last night at the United Center in Chicago.  Gilbert Brule, Antoine Vermette and Kyle Chipchura added
third-period goals for the Coyotes, who won even though they
were outshot by the Blackhawks 39-20. Phoenix advances to face
the fourth-seeded  Nashville Predators  in the second round.  “Winning the first series in franchise history is a huge
achievement for our team,” Smith said. “We’ve grown a lot as a
group. We have to keep improving. We’re not where we want to be
yet, but we’re finding ways to win games Coyotes-style.”  The  St. Louis Blues  will play the  Los Angeles Kings  in the
other Western Conference second-round series.  To contact the reporter on this story:
