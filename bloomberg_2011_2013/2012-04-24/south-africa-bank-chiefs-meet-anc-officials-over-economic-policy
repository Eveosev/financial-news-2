Chief executive officers and senior
leaders of South Africa’s biggest banks met officials from the
ruling  African National Congress  for talks over economic policy,
the  Banking Association of South Africa  said.  “It was a closed, private meeting yesterday with the
economic policy committee of the ANC,” association Chief
Executive Officer Cas Coovadia said in a telephone interview
today. The Johannesburg-based industry body represents the
interests of banks, including  Standard Bank (SBK)  Group Ltd.,  Absa
Group Ltd. (ASA) ,  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) ,  Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED)  and Investec.  “We were giving our input into the ANC’s economic
transformation policy document,” said Coovadia. Similar
meetings will be held in the future, he said, declining to give
details on the talks or who attended the meeting.  Enoch Godongwana, head of the ANC’s economic policy
committee, did not respond to calls and text messages sent to
his mobile-phone today. The CEOs wanted to raise concerns over
the ANC’s economic policy discussion documents, Johannesburg-
based  Business Day  reported, citing a person familiar with the
meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story: Sikonathi Mantshantsha in
