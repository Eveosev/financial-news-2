The number of U.S. natural-gas rigs
is “misleading” because some are actually drilling for oil and
liquids,  Pioneer (PXD)  Natural Resources Co. Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Scott Sheffield said.  There are probably only a couple of hundred drilling rigs
exploring in pure or “dry” gas fields, Sheffield said in an
interview at a Hart Energy conference in  Fort Worth ,  Texas 
today. In Texas, some rigs are classified as drilling for gas
because state rules allow operators to hold more acreage with a
gas well, Sheffield said.  Pioneer has 12 rigs in Texas’ Eagle Ford and it’s reporting
two oil rigs and 10 rigs drilling for gas, even though the
company is primarily drilling for oil, he said. Texas Railroad
Commission rules allow operators to hold 640 acres with a gas
well and only 40 or 80 acres with an oil well, he said.  There were  631 rigs  drilling for gas in the U.S. as of
April 20, according to  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)  That was the first time
in three weeks the number of gas rigs has increased. The rig
count has dropped 33 percent since Oct. 14 as the price of gas
has declined.  Gas settled at $1.975 per million British thermal units on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The futures have fallen 34
percent this year.  “When it says 600 gas rigs, I’m guessing there’s probably
only a couple hundred true dry-gas rigs in that 600,” Sheffield
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
