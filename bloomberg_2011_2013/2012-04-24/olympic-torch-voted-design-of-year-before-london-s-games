The Olympic torch was voted Design
of the Year in a U.K. contest, as judges chose to reward the
sporting emblem in the year of the 2012  London   Olympic Games .  Designed by London-based Edward Barber and Jay Osgerby, the
tapered rod has 8,000 holes representing the 8,000 bearers who
will carry it over 8,000 miles (12,874 kilometers). Runners-up
in the “Design of the Year 2012” announced last night included
Catherine Middleton’s wedding gown, a Zaha Hadid opera house in
 China , and Vivienne Westwood handbags made in  Kenya .  “Nothing is harder to get right than designing for the
Olympics,” said Deyan Sudjic, director of the Design Museum,
which runs the awards. “The lightness and simplicity of Barber
Osgerby’s London 2012 Olympic Torch does just that.”  The torch was not the only Olympic-themed winner: The
London 2012 Velodrome, designed by London-based Hopkins
Architects, picked up the award for architecture, one of seven
subsidiary prizes given out in individual categories.  The fashion award went to Issey Miyake’s 132.5 collection;
the digital award to Kinect by Microsoft; the transport award to
a redesign of the London Emergency Ambulance; the graphics award
to Nokia Pure, a font design that can adjust to all languages
and the furniture award to Kihyun Kim’s balsa chair.  The torch and other nominees are on display at the Design
Museum, Shad Thames, London SE1 2YD through July 4.  Information:  http://www.designoftheyear.com .  To contact the writer on this story:
