Hardy Oil & Gas Plc (HDY)  agreed to a
proposal by  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , India’s biggest company by
market value, to relinquish an offshore natural gas field after
tests showed it isn’t viable.  Reliance, the operator, yesterday proposed to return the
drilling license because the block’s gas potential is low and
further exploration isn’t needed, Hardy said in a regulatory
filing in London today. Hardy owns 10 percent of the block.  The partners discovered gas in June in a well in the KG-D9
block, located in the Krishna-Godavari basin off India’s east
coast where Reliance operates India’s biggest gas deposit in a
block known as KG-D6. Reliance is struggling to raise gas output
in India because of technical difficulties, resulting in profit
slumping by the most in more than three years in the quarter
ended March 31.  Tushar Pania, a spokesman for Reliance Industries, couldn’t
be reached on his mobile phone for comments.  Reliance  fell  as much as 1.7 percent to 723.70 rupees and
traded at 734.15 rupees as of 12:50 p.m. in Mumbai. The stock
has gained 6 percent this year, compared with an 11 percent
increase in the benchmark  Sensitive Index. (SENSEX)   Reliance  sold  30 percent stakes in 21 oil and gas blocks in
India, including KG-D6 and KG-D9, to  BP Plc (BP/)  for $7.2 billion
last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
