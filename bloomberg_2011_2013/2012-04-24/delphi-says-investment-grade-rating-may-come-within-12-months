Delphi Automotive Plc (DLPH) , the former
parts unit of  General Motors Co. (GM) , said it may earn an
investment-grade rating in about 12 months.  “Our metrics are investment grade,” Chief Financial
Officer Kevin Clark said in an interview. “We’ll continue to
perform and put up some good numbers and pay down some amount of
debt and that investment-grade rating should come with it.”  Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services on March 16 raised its
corporate  credit rating  on Delphi to BB+, the highest non-
investment grade.  “My estimate, and I probably should say it’s really a
guesstimate, is that it’s roughly a year out from today” to
achieve an investment-grade rating, Clark said. “We don’t
control that.”  Delphi, based in Troy,  Michigan , said today that first-
quarter profit rose 18 percent to $342 million, or $1.04 a
share, from $291 million, or 42 cents. Sales increased 2.4
percent to $4.09 billion.  Profit this year will be $3.63 to $3.85 a share, Delphi
said today. In January, it forecast profit of $3.44 to $3.69 a
share. The average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
was for a full-year profit of $3.71 a share.  The company, registered in Gillingham, U.K., returned to
profitability in 2010 after cutting costs and focusing on
selling fuel-injection systems and other car parts in faster-
growing countries such as  China .  Delphi fell 2.2 percent to $30.80 at 11:40 a.m. New York
time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
