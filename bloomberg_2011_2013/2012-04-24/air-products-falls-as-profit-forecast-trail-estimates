Air Products & Chemicals Inc. (APD) , the
world’s largest hydrogen producer, fell the most in five months
after its fiscal second-quarter results and full-year profit
forecast trailed analysts’ estimates.  Air Products  dropped  4.5 percent to close at $84.72 in  New
York , the biggest percentage decline since Nov. 9.  Net income for the first three months of 2012 fell to $296
million, or $1.38 a share, from $304.3 million, or $1.39, a year
earlier, the Allentown, Pennsylvania-based company said in a
statement today. Excluding discontinued operations, costs from
job cuts and a Spanish tax gain, profit was $1.31 a share, 2
cents less than the average of 12 analysts’ estimates compiled
by Bloomberg.  “Air Products remains impacted by sluggish recessionary
conditions unfolding in  Europe  and overall lower year-over-year
consumer electronics demand,” Michael J. Sison, a Cleveland-
based analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, said today in a
report. He rates the shares a buy.  Fiscal year 2012 earnings will be to $5.47 to $5.60 a
share, excluding 30 cents a share from Air Products’
discontinued homecare business, because of “lower levels of
business activity,” the company said. That compares with the
company’s January outlook of $5.90 to $6.30 a share, and the
$5.74 average of 14 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “While a portion of the downward full-year earnings
guidance is due to the divestiture of the homecare business,
which is a positive portfolio action, we sense operating results
to date have come in weaker than expected and a second half pick
up could be slower than expected,” Sison said in the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
