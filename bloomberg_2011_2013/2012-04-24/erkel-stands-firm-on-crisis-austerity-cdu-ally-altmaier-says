German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
won’t budge from her insistence on budget austerity in Europe as
unavoidable to resolving the debt crisis, a senior lawmaker in
her party said.  “The chancellor is pretty resistant to pressure,”  Peter Altmaier , the chief whip of Merkel’s  Christian Democratic Union ,
said in an interview today in Berlin. France’s presidential vote
and the Dutch government’s fall don’t change the fact “there’s
no money in Europe, only deficits everywhere you look.”  Socialist challenger  Francois Hollande , who leads President
Nicolas Sarkozy in polls for France’s runoff election on May 6,
said yesterday that austerity measures across Europe are leading
to “desperation” and that he will refocus the euro area’s
second-biggest economy on growth.  Altmaier warned that Hollande risked alienating investors
if he were to divert from the course of austerity.  “If Mr. Hollande were to say that he wants to increase
 government spending  and save less, he’ll lose the confidence of
the financial markets,” Altmaier said. “The same financial
markets that say they’re concerned about austerity will say, ‘My
God, this is not serious,’ if Hollande stops austerity and does
deficit spending.”  Merkel will await the election outcome in France and then
“try to come to an understanding with the new government,
regardless of who leads it,” Altmaier said. “We will stick to
our fundamental principles because there’s really no
alternative.’”  To contact the reporter on this story:
