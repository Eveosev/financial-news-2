Uganda ’s ruling National Resistance
Movement said its members may face disciplinary action if they
back calls to reinstate presidential term limits, New Vision
reported, citing party Secretary-General Amama Mbabazi.  The party’s National Executive Committee endorsed keeping
the current system without limits in the face of calls by some
lawmakers to reintroduce them, the Kampala-based newspaper cited
Mbabazi, who’s also the prime minister, as saying. The abolition
of the restriction in 2005 allowed President  Yoweri Museveni ,
who has been in power since 1986, to prolong his rule.  To contact the reporter on this story:
