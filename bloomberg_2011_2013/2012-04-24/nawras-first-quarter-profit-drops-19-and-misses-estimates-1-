Omani Qatari Telecommunications
Co. (NWRS) , a unit of  Qatar Telecom QSC (QTEL) , said first-quarter profit fell
19 percent as revenue from text messaging declined.  Net income dropped to 9.8 million rials ($26 million) from
12.1 million rials a year earlier, the company also known as
Nawras said in an e-mailed statement today. Revenue declined 2.7
percent to 46.8 million rials.  United Securities LLC forecast a profit of 12.3 million
rials, while Gulf Baader Capital Markets SAOC expected 12.2
million rials, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nawras will roll out its long-term evolution, or LTE,
network “at some point this year”, Chief Executive Officer
Ross Cormack said in a telephone interview today from Muscat.
LTE is a mobile broadband technology that allows for faster data
transmission, better voice quality and new mobile phone
applications.  “What we are seeing is a tremendous increase in data and
substituting data for SMS,” he said, adding the company will
upgrade its network over the next two years, declining to
provide details on investment.  Customer numbers rose to 1.98 million in the period from
1.94 million in the same quarter last year, helped by increases
in fixed-line and prepaid mobile clients.  Shares of Nawras declined 0.2 percent in trading on the
Muscat bourse today. The stock fell 8.9 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
