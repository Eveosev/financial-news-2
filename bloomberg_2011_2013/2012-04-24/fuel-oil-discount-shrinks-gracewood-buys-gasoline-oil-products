Asia  fuel oil ’s discount to crude
shrank to the smallest amount in 10 weeks, signaling lower
losses on turning oil into residual products. Gracewood
International Ltd. bought gasoline cargoes in Singapore.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil rose 19 cents to $4.03 a barrel below Asian
benchmark Dubai crude at 2:24 p.m. Singapore time, according to
data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. That’s the smallest
 discount  since Feb. 13.  Hin Leong Trading Pte bought two 20,000 metric-ton cargoes
of 380-centistoke fuel oil from Gunvor Group Ltd. for May 9 to
May 13 loading, according to a Bloomberg News survey of traders
who monitored transactions on the Platts window. The transaction
was at $2.50 a ton more than benchmark quotes.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade, or the  viscosity spread , was unchanged for a second day
at $9.75 a ton, PVM said. This means bunker, or marine fuel,
moved in tandem with higher-quality fuel oil.  Light Distillates  Gracewood bought 50,000 barrels of 92-RON gasoline for May
15 to May 19 loading from Vitol Group at $129.20 a barrel,
according to the Bloomberg survey. The Hong Kong-based trader

from Total SA at $135.30.  Trafigura bought 50,000 barrels of 92-RON gasoline from BP
Plc at $129.80 a barrel, the survey showed. Morgan Stanley

futures rose 11 percent to $117.80 a ton at 5:08 p.m.  Singapore 
time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack spread,
a measure of the profit from making the gasoline and
petrochemical feedstock, widened the most in two weeks.  Middle Distillates  Trafigura bought 250,000 barrels of  gasoil , or diesel, with
0.5 percent sulfur from Glencore International Plc at 20 cents a
barrel below benchmark quotes, according to the Bloomberg survey.
The cargo is for May 9 to May 13 loading.  Total sold 150,000 barrels with 10 parts-per-million of
sulfur to ConocoPhillips at $3 a barrel above quotes, the survey
showed. Reliance Industries Ltd. sold a similar cargo to
PetroChina at the same premium and another shipment to BP at $3
a barrel over May prices.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude increased 13 cents to
$17.08 a barrel at 2:24 p.m. Singapore time, PVM data showed.
This  crack spread , a gauge of processing profit, widened for the
sixth time in seven days.  Jet fuel ’s premium to gasoil was unchanged for a second day
at 45 cents a barrel, PVM said. This  regrade  gained 29 percent
last week, indicating it was profitable to make  aviation fuel .  Tenders  Essar Oil Ltd. offered to sell 60,000 tons of vacuum gasoil
for May loading from Vadinar, said three traders who declined to
