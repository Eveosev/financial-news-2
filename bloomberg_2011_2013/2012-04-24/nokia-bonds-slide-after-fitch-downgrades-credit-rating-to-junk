Bonds of  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  fell after  Fitch
Ratings  lowered its grades to junk and said it might cut again
if the mobile phone manufacturer is unable to stabilize its
finances.  The yield premium investors demand to hold the 500 million
euros ($658 million) of 6.75 percent bonds due 2019 the Espoo,
Finland-based company issued in 2009 increased 19 basis points
to 636, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. Spreads on
its 1.25 billion euros of 5.5 percent bonds maturing 2014 also
widened, increasing 70 basis points to 4.91 percent.  The long-term rating was lowered by one step to BB+, the
highest junk ranking, Fitch said a statement today. Fitch kept
its negative outlook and said it may reduce the grade further if
Nokia’s revenue doesn’t stabilize and operating margins don’t
turn positive.  To contact the reporter on this story:
