in first and eighth paragraphs of story published yesterday.)  Gold may decline a second day in
London on concern physical demand remains slack amid a festival
in  India . Silver was near a three-month low after holdings in
exchange-traded products fell the most since December.  Gold fell to $1,623.55 an ounce yesterday, the lowest level
since April 5, on concern the political climate in  France  and

debt crisis. The Akshaya Tritiya festival, considered an
auspicious day to buy precious metals, is celebrated today in
India, last year’s biggest bullion buyer.  “India’s jewelry demand or physical interest from the

festival this week, which is a concern,”  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an
analyst at VTB Capital in London, wrote today in a report.
