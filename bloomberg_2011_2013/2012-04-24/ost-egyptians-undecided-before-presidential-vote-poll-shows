Most Egyptians are undecided a
month before the start of the first presidential election after
the end of  Hosni Mubarak ’s three decades in office, a poll
conducted by  Al Masry Al Youm  shows.  Of the 2,129 people surveyed on April 19, 54.4 percent said
they haven’t chosen one of the 13 candidates that have so far
qualified to be on the final ballot. That compares with 38
percent in the first poll conducted by the Cairo-based
independent daily almost two weeks earlier.  The increase comes after  Egypt ’s presidential election
commission disqualified 10 nominees, including Salafi cleric
Hazem Abu Ismail and  Omar Suleiman , the former president’s
intelligence chief. Abu Ismail and Suleiman led with 25.2
percent and 21.3 percent, respectively, in a poll published by
the state-run  Al Ahram newspaper  yesterday and conducted before
their official exclusion from the race.  Former Muslim Brotherhood member Abdel Moneim Aboul-Fotouh
led Al Masry’s poll among the decided, with 15.5 percent, and
former Arab League Secretary-General Amre Moussa was second,
with 12.5 percent. Mohamed Morsi, the candidate of the Muslim
Brotherhood, whose political arm controls almost half of seats
in parliament, was in fifth place with 1.5 percent, the survey
shows.  The final list of candidates will be announced on April 26
and the vote will take place on May 23 and May 24, according to
a timeline announced by the election commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
