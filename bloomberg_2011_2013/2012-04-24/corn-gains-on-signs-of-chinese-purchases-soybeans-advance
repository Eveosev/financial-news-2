Corn rose for a second straight day
on speculation that  China , the world’s biggest grower after the
U.S., is increasing purchases to build state reserves. Soybeans
also advanced.  U.S. exporters sold 480,000 metric tons of corn to unknown
destinations, the Department of Agriculture said today. China
may have purchased as much as 1 million tons last week to
increase stockpiles, reseracher Grain.gov.cn said today in a
report. The  cost  of importing U.S. corn on April 19 fell to the
lowest this month, according to Shanghai JC Intelligence Co.  “Traders see today’s announcement as confirmation of
Chinese purchases and look for more U.S. sales to occur,” Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness for Archer Financial Services
Inc. in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “U.S. supplies
are getting tighter.”  Corn futures for July delivery gained 0.7 percent to
$6.1675 a bushel at 10:12 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The commodity rose 1.6 percent yesterday.  Soybeans climbed on speculation that overseas demand for
U.S. supplies will increase after South American production was
curtailed by drought, Grow said.  The harvest in  Argentina , the biggest shipper of  animal
feed  and cooking oil made from the oilseed, may fall to as low
as 42 million tons, down 15 percent from a year ago, Oil World,
a Hamburg-based researcher, said today in a report. In the week
ended April 12, U.S.  sales  of soy-based animal feed doubled from
a year earlier and were the highest for the date since at least
2003, USDA data show.  Soybean futures for July delivery rose 0.9 percent to
$14.5375 a bushel, gaining for the third time in four sessions.
The most-active contract touched a seven-month high on April 20
at $14.5875.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
