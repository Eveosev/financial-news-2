Egypt  will offer 17 billion
Egyptian pounds ($2.8 billion) of seven-day  repurchase
agreements  today, after accepting bids for 19.2 billion pounds
last week. Dollar bonds declined for a second day.  The contracts, known as repos, allow government securities
holders to sell them back to the North African country’s central
bank to access funds for a week at 9.75 percent, according to
the regulator’s data on Bloomberg. The facility was started in
March 2011 to ease funding pressure at local banks as they
increased holdings of government debt amid political unrest.  Yields on domestic debt have declined from record highs
after the central bank lowered the local-currency reserve
requirement for banks, making more cash available to buy
 government bonds  and bills. The  Finance Ministry  sold five-year
notes yesterday at an average yield of 16.54 percent, the lowest
level in more than three months.  The rate on the 5.75 percent dollar bonds due 2020 advanced
less than one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.93
percent at 11:30 a.m. in Cairo, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. The Egyptian pound was little changed at 6.0484 a
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
