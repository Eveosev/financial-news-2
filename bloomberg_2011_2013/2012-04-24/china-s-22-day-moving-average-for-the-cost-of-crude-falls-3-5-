China ’s 22-day moving average for
three crude benchmark grades that the government monitors to set
fuel prices fell 3.5 percent as of yesterday from the last fuel-
price adjustment on March 19.  The average assumes an equal weighting for all three grades.
Under a mechanism introduced by the government in 2008,
gasoline, diesel and kerosene tariffs may be adjusted when the
22-day moving average of Brent, Dubai and Cinta changes more
than 4 percent from the last official price revision. The
government hasn’t provided the weighting for the grades.  Prices in the following table are in U.S. dollars a barrel
and are according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
