Egypt ’s foreign reserves are
expected to increase in May, Al Masry Al Youm reported, citing
Planning and International Cooperation Minister Fayza Aboulnaga.  Aboulnaga said the pace at which foreign reserves have been
declining has slowed sharply since the uprising that pushed
 Hosni Mubarak  from power last year. The government’s policy of
allowing investors to transfer funds out of the country has
helped boost confidence even though about $10 billion left the
country in the first two months after the uprising.  To contact the reporter on this story:
