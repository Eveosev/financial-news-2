Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) , the Czech unit
of Societe Generale SA, rebounded from a three-month low after
countries including Spain and the Netherlands sold debt and
before data that may show home sales in the U.S. increased.  The stock climbed 1.2 percent to 3,355 koruna by 11:33 a.m.
in Prague. The 14-member  PX (PX)  equity index, where Komercni Banka
has a 17 percent weighting, advanced 1 percent.  Komercni Banka tumbled 3.1 percent yesterday to its lowest
since Jan. 17, cutting the stockâ€™s 14-day relative strength
index to 25. Readings lower than 30 suggest to some technical
analysts the security may increase. The RSI rose to 31 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
