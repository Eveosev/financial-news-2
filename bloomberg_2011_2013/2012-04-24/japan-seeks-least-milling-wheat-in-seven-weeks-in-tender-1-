Japan  is seeking to buy 106,200
metric tons of milling wheat from the U.S. and  Canada  in a
regular tender on April 26, the lowest volume in seven weeks,
the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said today.  Shipments must be made between May 21 and June 20,
excluding dark northern spring wheat from the U.S. that is for
arrival in Japan by July 31, Toshiki Tojo at the ministry’s
grain-trade division said by phone. The volume sought is the
smallest since March 8, when the government bought 96,061 tons.  The ministry, which controls overseas purchases and
domestic sales to stabilize supply, is  Asia ’s largest buyer as a
single entity. Details of this week’s tender are listed below:  To contact the reporter on this story:
