Royal Philips Electronics NV Chief
Executive Officer Frans  Van Houten  isn’t ruling out small
acquisitions, though that’s not the group’s main aim,  Le Figaro 
reported, citing an interview with Van Houten.  Philips’s portfolio, which comprises consumer electronics,
lighting products and a healthcare unit, is well balanced, the
CEO told Le Figaro, when asked if Philips might focus only on
lighting and health care.  To contact the reporter on this story:
