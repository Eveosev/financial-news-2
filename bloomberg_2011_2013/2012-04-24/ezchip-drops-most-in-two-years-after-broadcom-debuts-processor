EZchip Semiconductor Ltd. (EZCH)  posted
the largest decline in two years in New York on concern
competitor Broadcom Corp.’s network processor will steal market
share from the Israeli chipmaker.  Shares of the Yokneam, Israel-based company tumbled 9.3
percent to $39.28, the largest one-day slide since May 6, 2010.
The drop swelled the U.S. stock’s discount to the company’s Tel
Aviv shares to $4.48, the most on record.  Broadcom will start selling a processor unit to service
provider networks, the Irvine, California-based company said in
a statement distributed by PRNewswire today. The product will
compete with EZchip’s chips, Sundeep Bajikar, an analyst at
Jefferies & Co., wrote in an e-mailed note.  To contact the reporters on this story:
