Turkiye Garanti Bankası AS (GARAN) ,
 Turkey ’s biggest bank by market value, may say first-quarter
profit fell by an annual 3.6 percent on account of margin
detrioration from its inflation-linked bonds.  Net income will probably come in at 824.6 million liras
($461 million), compared with 855.2 million liras a year ago,
according to the average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. The analysts’ predictions ranged from 751 million
liras to 895 million liras.  “There’s some volatility caused by inflation-linked
bonds,” Bulent Sengonul, an analyst at Is Investment &
Securities said in a phone interview today. “But putting that
to one side, net interest income will be strong due to the
positive trend in loan-to-deposit spreads. Income from fees and
commissions looks healthy as well,” he said.  Garanti reported a 790 million-lira profit in the fourth
quarter of 2011, an increase of 14 percent over the same period
in the previous year.  Turkey’s inflation rate held at 10.4 percent last month,
close to a three-year high and more than double the central
bank’s 5 percent target.  Garanti, part-owned by  Spain ’s  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria (BBVA) , is expected to report the earnings later today or
tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
