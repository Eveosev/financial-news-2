A gauge of U.S. company credit risk
fell as  Spain  and the Netherlands sold debt, easing concern
 Europe â€™s debt crisis is spreading.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, fell 0.9 basis point to a mid-price of 100
basis points at 8:04 a.m. in New York, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg.  The measure decreased after Spain sold 1.9 billion euros
($2.5 billion) of bills, while the Netherlands auctioned 2
billion euros of securities.  New home sales  in the U.S. probably
rose in March, according to the median estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg before a Commerce Department report today.  The credit swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
