Some  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  investors are
demanding that shareholders don’t release the lender’s
supervisory board from its responsibilities for the 2011 fiscal
year at the bank’s annual meeting,  Financial Times Deutschland 
reported, citing Hans-Christoph Hirt, a manager for Hermes,
which represents the group.  The claimants, consisting of 28 investors owning less than
1 percent of Deutsche Bank shares, criticize what they say was
mismanagement in recent appointments to senior posts, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
