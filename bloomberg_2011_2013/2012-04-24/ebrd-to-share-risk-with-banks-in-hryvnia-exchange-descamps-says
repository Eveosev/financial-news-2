The  European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development  may grant loans in Ukraine with
the right to convert into local currency by its partner banks,
said Olivier Descamps, EBRD’s Managing Director for  Turkey ,
Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia.  “We take part in the risk long term,” Descamps told
reporters in Ukrainian capital Kiev today. “Provided that the
bank would assure guarantees for half of exposure.”  EBRD may start two such loan programs this year with some
of its 12 partner banks in Ukraine, Descamps said, adding that
EBRD will issue loans to banks in foreign currency and allow
lenders to convert it into hryvnia. The loans will be provided
for projects in energy savings and renewable energy.  The EBRD, which has invested more than 5.9 billion euro
($7.79 billion) in Ukraine since 1991, is pushing for
legislative changes to allow it to lend in hryvnia to help its
clients avoid foreign-exchange risks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
