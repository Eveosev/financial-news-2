Sri Lanka  received “positive
responses” from Saudi Arabian Oil Co. and Oman Oil Co. for
supplies as the country seeks to reduce its dependence on
Iranian crude, its oil minister said.  The island nation, which imports 13 of its 14 annual crude
cargoes from Iran, plans to cut shipments from Iran to 10 a year
to comply with U.S. sanctions, Susil Premajayantha said. It
would like to double purchases from  Saudi Arabia  to 2 lots, and
obtain 2 consignments from Oman, the minister said.  “We have to reduce 13 cargoes to 10 by the end of the year
to meet sanctions requirements,” Premajayantha said at a
conference in  Abu Dhabi  today. “We have received a positive
response from Aramco to get one more cargo, and we expect to
hear from Oman in a couple of days, but their response has also
been positive.”  The European Union and U.S. have imposed sanctions to
protest  Iran’s nuclear program , restricting trade and financial
transactions. The U.S. and its allies say they suspect the
program is a cover for developing atomic weapons, a charge Iran
has repeatedly denied, maintaining it’s for civilian purposes.  Iran hasn’t offered Sri Lanka any incentives to make its
crude more attractive, Premajayantha said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
