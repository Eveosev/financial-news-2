Austria ’s auction for wireless
spectrum, which will free airwaves for high-speed mobile
services, will be delayed as regulators grapple with a tie-up
between two of the largest providers.  Austria’s telecommunications regulator postponed an auction
of radio frequencies that was scheduled for September because of
the planned takeover of Orange Austria,  Telekom Austria AG (TKA)  said
in a statement today.  “A new timeline for the auction has not been announced due
to the uncertainty regarding the duration of the merger
proceedings,” which include a side-deal in which Telekom
Austria is acquiring some of Orange’s assets, the Vienna-based
company said.  Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13) , the telecommunications company
owned by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, agreed to acquire
Orange Austria in February in a deal valued at 1.3 billion euros
($1.7 billion). Hutchison plans to merge its Austrian 3 unit
with Orange, making it the country’s third-biggest mobile
provider after Telekom Austria and  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ’s T-
Mobile Austria.  While Austria’s Federal Competition Authority has said the
deal may have to be amended, Telekom Austria Chief Financial
Officer Hans Tschuden said in February that he is confident that
the company won’t have to make any divestitures.  The Austrian Regulatory Authority for Broadcasting and
Telecommunications yesterday said in a  statement  on its website
that it couldn’t predict how long the approval procedure for the
Orange deal may take.  To contact the reporter on this story:
