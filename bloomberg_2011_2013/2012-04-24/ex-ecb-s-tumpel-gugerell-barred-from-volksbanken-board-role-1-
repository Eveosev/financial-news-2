Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, a former
European Central Bank executive board member, can’t join the
supervisory board of Austrian nationalized lender
 Oesterreichische Volksbanken AG (VBPS)  because of ECB rules.
Taking the post would clash with the ECB’s “cooling-off
period,” she said by phone today.  The Alpine republic named Tumpel-Gugerell, a member of the
ECB Executive Board from 2003 to 2011, as one of four candidates
for Volksbanken’s new nine-member supervisory board, according
to the candidate list released to shareholders on April 5.
Tumpel-Gugerell, who was vice governor of the Austrian central
bank before her ECB job, may become the bank’s chairwoman, the
Wiener Zeitung newspaper reported April 3. The new members are
scheduled to be elected at an April 26 shareholder meeting.  Tumpel-Gugerell also is due to be elected to the
supervisory board of Commerzbank AG at the German bank’s May 23
shareholder meeting, according to the April 11 meeting
invitation.  “Following Ms Tumpel-Gugerell’s request for authorization
to be appointed as member of the supervisory board of
Oesterreichische Volksbanken AG and  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  the ECB’s
Governing Council advised Ms Tumpel-Gugerell to take up the
positions as of 1 June 2012, i.e. after the ‘‘cooling off”
period,’’ William Lelieveldt, a spokesman for the ECB, said by
e-mail today.  Austria Press Agency reported the news earlier today,
citing unidentified people familiar with the situation.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
