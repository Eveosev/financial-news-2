German stocks  advanced, rebounding
from the lowest level in almost three months, as a report showed
sales of new U.S. homes exceeded economists’ forecasts in March.  Infineon Technologies AG (IFX)  climbed 2.2 percent after peer
Texas Instruments Inc. forecast second-quarter earnings that may
top some analysts’ estimates.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  increased
2.3 percent as Credit Suisse Group AG upgraded the shares.
 Volkswagen AG (VOW)  led automakers higher.  The benchmark  DAX (DAX)  Index added 1 percent to 6,590.41 at the
close of trading in  Frankfurt . The gauge tumbled 3.4 percent
yesterday to its lowest level since Jan. 31 as manufacturing
contracted in the euro area and  China , and Dutch Prime Minister
 Mark Rutte  offered his Cabinet’s resignation after struggling to
reach an austerity deal. The broader HDAX Index also increased 1
percent today.  “While yesterday’s move to the downside might have been
overdone and a moderate rebound wouldn’t be too much of a
surprise, plenty of uncertainty remains, making it difficult for
stocks to bottom out,” Markus Huber, head of German sales
trading at ETX Capital in  London , wrote in an e-mail.  In the U.S, purchases of new homes dropped in March to a
328,000 annual rate, a decline of 7.1 percent from a revised
353,000 pace in February that was stronger than initially
projected, figures from the Commerce Department showed today in
 Washington . Economists forecast a rate of 319,000 last month,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  U.S. Confidence  Confidence among U.S. consumers was little changed in April
as expectations over the outlook tempered increased optimism
about the present. The Conference Board’s confidence index was
at 69.2 compared with a revised 69.5 in the prior month, figures
from the New York-based research group showed today. The median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a
reading of 69.6.  The Netherlands sold 2 billion euros ($2.6 billion) of
bonds maturing in July 2014 and January 2037 today. The
government had aimed to issue as much as 2.5 billion euros of
the securities.  Infineon,  Europe ’s second-largest semi-conductor maker,
rose 2.2 percent to 7.27 euros after falling 6.7 percent
yesterday. Texas Instruments, the largest maker of analog
semiconductors, forecast second-quarter earnings that may top
some analysts’ estimates, buoyed by a revival in chip orders.  Automakers Gain  Preferred shares of Volkswagen, Europe’s largest automaker,
advanced 1.9 percent to 123.50 euros, after four days of
declines. A gauge of auto-related companies was the best
performer among the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx Europe 600

automaker, rose 0.9 percent to 67.60 euros.  Daimler AG (DAI) , the
third-biggest, climbed 2 percent to 40.28 euros.  Continental AG (CON) , Europe’s second-largest tiremaker, advanced
2.4 percent to 68.95 euros after rival Michelin & Cie. said
first-quarter revenue rose 5.1 percent to 5.3 billion euros on
higher demand for specialty tires to equip earthmovers, aircraft
and agricultural vehicles.  Lufthansa added 2.3 percent to 9.57 euros. Credit Suisse
upgraded the stock to overweight, meaning investors should buy
the shares, from neutral.  Hochtief AG (HOT) ,  Germany ’s biggest builder, climbed 4.2 percent
to 42.54 euros after one of its units received contracts worth a
total of 672.9 million euros.  Gerresheimer AG (GXI) , the maker of glass and plastic products
for the health-care industry, added 1.6 percent to 34.88 euros.
The shares were upgraded to buy from hold at  Commerzbank AG. (CBK)   Linde AG (LIN) , the world’s second-biggest supplier of industrial
