The following companies had unusual
price changes in Argentine trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and share prices are as of the close in Buenos
Aires. The  Merval (MERVAL)  index rose 0.1 percent to 2,311.18.  Empresa Distribuidora & Comercializadora Norte SA (EDN)  
fell 4.8 percent to 0.7 pesos, its lowest price since April
2009. Argentina’s largest power distribution company announced
the sale of a unit in the province of Salta for 99 million pesos
($22.4 million) in Argentine government bonds. The stock fell as
investors see this as a sign that the company is forced to sell
assets as it’s running short on cash, Rafael Aldazabal,
president of Buenos Aires-based brokerage Aldazabal & Cia., said
in a phone interview.  Siderar SAIC (ERAR)   retreated 1.4 percent to 1.37 pesos.
Argentina’s largest steel producer reported first-quarter profit
of 308 million pesos, down from 400 million pesos a year
earlier, according to a statement posted on the website of the
Buenos Aires stock exchange.  YPF SA (YPFD)   fell 4.9 percent to 74.30 pesos, its
lowest price since March 2009. Spain’s Repsol YPF SA said its
Argentine unit invested $20 billion from 1999, refuting the
government’s statement that it didn’t invest enough. The company
also canceled a shareholder meeting scheduled for tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
