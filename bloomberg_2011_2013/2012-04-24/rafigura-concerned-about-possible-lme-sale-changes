Commodities trader Trafigura Beheer
BV is “concerned” about the possible sale of the London Metal
Exchange, the world’s biggest metals bourse, as it may mean
changes to its operations.  “The LME serves its function very well,” Simon Collins,
director and head of dry bulk commodities at Amsterdam-based
Trafigura, told the FT Global Commodities Summit in Lausanne,
 Switzerland , today. “A possible sale of the LME concerns me as
things will change,” he said. Trafigura is the second-largest
independent trader in industrial metal concentrates, according
to its website.  The LME, which handles more than 80 percent of industrial
metals futures, will consider takeover offers made by May 7. CME
Group Inc., NYSE Euronext and Intercontinental Exchange Inc.
have made preliminary offers, three people with direct knowledge
of the matter said in February. Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing
Ltd. is considering borrowing as much as $3 billion to back a
possible bid for the bourse, according to two people familiar
with the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
