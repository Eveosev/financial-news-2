Costa Rica  plans to start
negotiating free trade agreements with South Korea and Colombia
this year and complete an accord with members of the European
Free Trade Area by October, the country’s trade minister said.  South Korea and Colombia “have presented a feasibility
study and we are basically waiting for Korea to be ready,”
Anabel Gonzalez said in an interview at a conference in Doha,
Qatar. “I hope again that we can launch negotiations around the
middle of this year and the same with Colombia.”  Central America’s second-biggest economy has completed two
rounds of negotiations with the  European Free Trade Area ,
comprising Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Lichtenstein, she
said. The next round is scheduled for June.  Costa Rica has opened its economy to foreign investment and
pursued trade agreements with countries including the U.S.,
 Canada  and the European Union. Last year, President Laura Chinchilla signed a free trade accord with  China .  Foreign direct investment in Costa Rica rose 52 percent to
a record $1.56 billion in the first nine months of 2011 on
increased spending by technology and telecommunications
companies. The country counts as investors U.S. corporations
such as Intel Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and
Hewlett-Packard Co., which have manufacturing and service units
in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
