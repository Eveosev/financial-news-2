Peruvian bonds rose, pushing down
yields the most in a week, as investors bought sol-denominated
securities on speculation foreign inflows will bolster the local
currency at a 15-year high.  The yield on the benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due in August 2020 fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 5.29 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.24 centimo to 116.85 centimos per
sol.  Peru ’s central bank has purchased $7.5 billion this year to
stem gains in the sol as rising foreign investment in mining and
energy projects fuels growth.  “The currency is definitely helping” the country’s bonds,
said Manuel Aldave, the head of investment at Banco
Internacional del Peru in  Lima .  The sol was little changed at 2.6510 per  U.S. dollar ,
compared with 2.6520 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s
local unit. The currency earlier today touched 2.65, the
strongest level since 1997,  data  from Peru’s financial regulator
show. The sol has rallied 1.7 percent this year.  The central bank didn’t buy dollars in the  spot market 
today, it said on its website.  Overseas investors may acquire as much as 50 percent of the
$500 million in sol-denominated bonds the government may issue
locally this year, boosting demand for soles,  Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria  said April 19. The currency will likely
strengthen to 2.60 by Dec. 31 because of foreign direct
investment and exports, according to the bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
