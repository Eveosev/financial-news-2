Scania AB (SCVB) , the Swedish truckmaker
controlled by  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , reported first-quarter profit that
beat estimates after the company eliminated jobs to prepare for
slowing demand and raised prices on some models.  Net income fell 29 percent to 1.79 billion kronor ($266
million) from 2.51 billion kronor a year earlier, the
Soedertaelje, Sweden-based company said in a statement today.
Profit was more than the 1.54 billion-krona average of 10
analyst estimates  compiled  by Bloomberg. Sales declined 3
percent to 20.1 billion kronor.  “Lower vehicle deliveries and lower capacity utilization
pulled down earnings, as did higher costs for future-related
projects,” while “a more favorable market mix had a positive
effect,” Chief Executive Officer Leif Oestling said in the
statement.  Scania started cutting production globally by about 15
percent in January following a similar move in  Europe  in
November as the sovereign-debt crisis deepened in the region.
Scania let contracts lapse for most of its 1,400 temporary
workers in Europe, and the majority of its temporary employees
in  Latin America  also had to leave the company.  Industrywide registrations of heavy commercial vehicles in
the European Union fell 11 percent from a year earlier in
February, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers
Association.  Scania rose as much as 5.1 percent to 133.7 kronor and was
trading up 4.7 percent at 9:53 a.m. in  Stockholm . The stock has
gained 31 percent this year.  First-quarter new orders fell 19 percent to 15,809 trucks
and buses, the Swedish company said today. Deliveries decreased
15 percent to 16,238 vehicles.  The manufacturer is the first large European truckmaker to
publish first-quarter figures. Swedish competitor  Volvo AB (VOLVB)  is
scheduled to report earnings on April 26. Stuttgart, Germany-
based  Daimler AG (DAI) , the world’s largest truckmaker, plans to
release profit figures on April 27, while  MAN SE (MAN) , the Munich-
based commercial-vehicle manufacturer also controlled by VW,
will publish its numbers on May 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
