OAO MegaFon,  Russia ’s second-
largest mobile-phone operator, will pay owners  TeliaSonera AB (TLSN) ,
AF Telecom and Altimo $5.15 billion in dividends and pursue an
initial public offering in  London , ending a governance dispute.  Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov’s AF Telecom will get
majority control of MegaFon, buying part of TeliaSonera’s stake
and Altimo’s entire shareholding, Stockholm-based TeliaSonera
said today. The shareholders have agreed to sell as much as 20
percent of MegaFon in an IPO on the London stock exchange “as
soon as practically possible,” TeliaSonera said.  TeliaSonera and Altimo, the telecommunications arm of  Alfa
Group , agreed in 2009 to combine their stakes in MegaFon and
 Turkey ’s  Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS (TCELL)  in a new company to
clarify ownership and increase dividends. That pact was never
carried out because of legal disputes. MegaFon’s share sale may
raise as much as $4 billion in the world’s biggest IPO since
July, people with knowledge of the plan said last week.  “Compared to MTS, MegaFon has a bit inferior growth but
higher cash generation power so I think that some people might
want to switch from MTS to MegaFon if it’s floated,” said
Nadezhda Golubeva, a Moscow-based analyst with  UniCredit SpA (UCG) ,
referring to larger rival OAO  Mobile TeleSystems. (MBT)   Subscribers  MegaFon had 61.6 million subscribers in Russia at the end
of last year, as well as units in Tajikistan, Abkhazia and
Ossetia. The company  reported  net income of 43.6 billion rubles
($1.5 billion) on sales of 242.6 billion rubles last year.
MegaFon last week  named  Ivan Tavrin, a founder of several media
companies in Russia, as chief executive officer.  TeliaSonera’s Finnish and Swedish predecessor companies set
up MegaFon as a national operator in 2002 with partners by
merging local phone companies. Alfa agreed to buy out another
owner in 2003. The company contemplated an IPO in 2003 and again
in 2005.  “The shares could command a 10 to 15 percent premium over
MTS, which trades at a deep discount to its peers due to
aggressive activity from major shareholder Sistema,” said
Victor Klimovich, a Moscow-based analyst at VTB Capital.
TeliaSonera said two independent investment banks would evaluate
the share valuation.  London IPO  At $4 billion, MegaFon’s IPO would be the biggest since
July, when  Spain ’s  Bankia SA (BKIA)  raised $4.4 billion. Six out of the
10 biggest IPOs in London last year were from Russian issuers,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Moscow-based real
estate investment firm O1 Properties Plc is currently gauging
investor interest for its London IPO.  TeliaSonera  jumped  7.4 percent to 44.50 kronor at 12:25
P.M. in  Stockholm . Sweden’s largest telephone company, which is
37 percent state-owned, said it will receive about 22 billion
kronor ($3.3 billion) in dividends and proceeds from the sale of
an indirect 8.2 percent stake in MegaFon to AF Telecom.  “We are dealing with two of the richest oligarchs in
Russia, very successful but also stubborn,” Nyberg said on the
call. “They couldn’t agree on the price AF Telecom was supposed
to pay for the stake they were buying from Altimo. There was a
200 million gap and we decided to bridge the gap. That’s the
real story.”  Altimo will get $5.2 billion in total from dividends and
the sale of its 25.1 percent stake. After the IPO, the board is
planned to consist of three representatives from AF Telecom, two
from TeliaSonera and two independents, TeliaSonera said.  “Nothing concrete has ever been presented to us” on
whether  Megafon  could merge with OAO Rostelecom, Nyberg said,
referring to Russia’s dominant long-distance phone company.
TeliaSonera’s stake would give it blocking rights on big mergers
and acquisitions, he said on the teleconference.  ‘Good Price’  “Altimo is getting a good price,” said Sergey Libin, an
analyst at Raiffeisen Bank in Moscow. “MegaFon has quite a lot
of cash and the IPO doesn’t mean they’ll receive any advantage
over competitors because they are already in a better financial
position.”  After the shareholder transactions, AF Telecom will own 50
percent plus one share in MegaFon, TeliaSonera will hold 35.6
percent, and MegaFon, through a subsidiary, will own 14.4
percent of its own shares.  “Three years ago I concluded we can probably never get
control of MegaFon and then I said I want liquidity,”
TeliaSonera Chief Executive Officer Lars Nyberg said in a
telephone interview. “We have never seen a dime from this
investment, it has been terrific but we’ve never seen any cash
so having a one-time dividend and a dividend policy was very
attractive to us.”  Turkcell Dispute  MegaFon’s three main shareholders have been discussing the
ownership and governance of the company for about three months,
 Cecilia Edstroem , a TeliaSonera spokeswoman, said April 11.
Koray Ozturkler, Turkcell’s chief corporate affairs officer,
didn’t answer phone calls from Bloomberg seeking comment.  Altimo will continue working with TeliaSonera on Turkcell
and expects legal disputes over a stake sale to be resolved this
year, Alfa Group Chairman  Mikhail Fridman  said in the statement.  The dispute over Turkcell dates back to 2005 when Cukurova
Holding AS sold a 13 percent stake in the Turkish phone company
to Alfa Group after agreeing to sell it to TeliaSonera.  Alfa
Group (ALFA)  won a court decision in the Eastern Caribbean giving it
control of the disputed shares. TeliaSonera, which cooperated
with Alfa Group, was awarded $932 million by a Geneva court last
year in place of the shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
