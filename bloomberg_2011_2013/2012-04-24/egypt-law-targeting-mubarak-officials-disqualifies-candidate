Egypt ’s military ruler has signed a
law barring officials from Hosni Mubarak’s government from
running in next month’s presidential election, raising questions
about the candidacy of one of the 13 remaining candidates in the
race.  The country’s election commission is to hold an emergency
meeting today on the measure, the state-run Al Ahram gate
website reported today, citing commission Secretary-General
Hatem Bagato.  Bagato declined to comment in a telephone interview today
on whether the decision would affect the candidacy of Ahmed
Shafiq, one of the 13 politicians whose nomination bid was
previously approved by the commission.  Shafiq, who briefly served as prime minister last year,
entered the race before the law was drafted or approved, and his
disqualification could inject new unease into a vote that has
already seen tensions flare with the barring of three of the
leading and most controversial candidates, including Suleiman,
on various electoral technicalities.  Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi yesterday approved
the measure, passed by the Islamist-dominated parliament’s lower
house, that would bar officials who held senior posts under the
former government from running for the presidency, the vice
presidency or holding the premiership until 2021. The
announcement was carried late yesterday on the state-run Middle
East  News Agency .  To contact the reporter on this story:
