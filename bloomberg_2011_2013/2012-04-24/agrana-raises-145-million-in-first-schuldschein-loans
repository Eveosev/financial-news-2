Agrana Beteiligungs AG (AGR) ,  Austria ’s
biggest sugar producer, raised 110 million euros ($145 million)
from its first Schuldschein loans.  Agrana increased the amount raised because of investor
demand for the loans, the Vienna-based company said in a
statement today. The loans were issued in portions with fixed
and variable interest rates and due in 2017, 2019 and 2022.  Schuldschein loans are promissory notes issued privately
under German law. Austria’s Strabag SE said last month that it
sold 140 million euros of Schuldschein loans and RHI AG also is
considering selling Schuldschein loans.  Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen and Raiffeisen Bank
International acted as bookrunners for the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
