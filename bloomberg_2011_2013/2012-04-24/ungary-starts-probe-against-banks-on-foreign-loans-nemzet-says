The Hungarian prosecutorâ€™s office
started an investigation into domestic commercial lenders over
foreign-currency loans,  Magyar Nemzet  reported, citing the
person who requested the probe.  The investigation, involving all domestic banks, is focused
on possible  tax evasion , the Budapest-based newspaper said,
citing Arpad Kasler, head of a lobby group representing
borrowers.  Kasler expects class action cases against individual banks
in the future, according to Nemzet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
