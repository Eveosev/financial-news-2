Sinovel Wind Group Co. (601558)  and  Xinjiang
Goldwind Science & Technology Co. (002202) ,  China ’s biggest wind turbine
makers, posted declines in first-quarter earnings as the
nation’s wind-power development slowed.  Sinovel said net income fell 87 percent from a year earlier
to 56.8 million yuan ($9 million), according to a   Shanghai 
stock exchange filing yesterday. Goldwind profit fell 97 percent
to 6.18 million yuan, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange
statement yesterday. The company said April 13 that profit may
have been wiped out in the first quarter.  Overcapacity and price competition at home and abroad has
trimmed the margins of China’s turbine producers. Global prices
fell to 910,000 euros ($1.2 million) a megawatt, the lowest
since at least 2008, in the second half 2011 from the previous
six months, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Goldwind dropped 2.4 percent to HK$3.65 at the close of
 Hong Kong  trading yesterday, before the earnings. The stock has
declined 69 percent over 12 months. Sinovel declined 1.9 percent
to 15.86 yuan in Shanghai yesterday.  China is slowing the growth of its wind-power industry
through a stricter project-approval process as grids struggle to
carry electricity. The National Energy Administration issued
plans to approve 16.76 gigawatts of wind farms this year,
compared with 26.83 gigawatts in 2011.  The possibility that fewer projects may be approved in 2011
is “the worst news” for turbine makers, Michael Parker , an
analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in Hong Kong, said April
6. “Their growth’s going to decelerate and may be negative,”
he said.  Sinovel’s Chief Financial Officer Tao Gang said last month
that manufacturers will only return to profits after a
consolidation. The company is among Chinese producers seeking to
boost sales from abroad and to develop larger turbines to cope
with slower growth at home.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
