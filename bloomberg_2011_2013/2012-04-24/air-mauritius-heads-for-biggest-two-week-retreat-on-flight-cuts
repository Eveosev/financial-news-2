Air Mauritius Ltd. (AML) , sub-Saharan
Africa’s fourth-largest airline, fell the most in almost two
weeks after announcing a cut in long-haul flights.  The  stock  retreated 2.5 percent to 11.60 rupees at the
close in  Port Louis , the steepest single-day slide since April
11, extending the  airline’s decline  this year to 28 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Air Mauritius is the
second-worst performing stock in the SEMDEX gauge this year.  Flights to Milan, Sydney, Melbourne,  Frankfurt , Munich,
Geneva and Durban will be suspended this year, Air Mauritius
said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The reshuffling is part
of a restructuring plan to enable the airline to swing back into
profit during its fiscal year through March 2014.  “The decline is most probably attributable to the fact
that they are cutting long-haul flights,” said Kishen Nadassen,
a senior research analyst at Cim Stockbrokers Ltd., in a phone
interview today.  Frequency of short- and medium-haul flights will be
increased “mainly around the Indian Ocean rim and  emerging
markets ” resulting in a 3 percent rise in seat capacity during
fiscal year 2013, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
