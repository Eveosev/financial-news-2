Swiss exports declined in the first
quarter on flagging demand from the European Union, adding to
signs the strong franc is hampering foreign sales.  Exports adjusted for inflation and working days fell 0.8
percent from the year-earlier period, the Federal Customs Office
in Bern said in an e-mailed  statement  today. Imports rose 0.6
percent in the quarter and the trade surplus widened to 5.85
billion Swiss francs ($6.4 billion). Sales to EU countries
declined 3 percent on a non-adjusted basis, while sales to  Latin
America  and  Asia  climbed, according to the statement.  Slowing demand from the debt-laden euro area, Switzerland’s
biggest market, is weighing on exports, which until now had
defied the franc’s strength. On March 15, the government raised
its 2012 forecast for export growth to 1.3 percent from 0.4
percent.  “Exports will climb in the coming months,” said  Claude Maurer , an economist at Credit Suisse Group AG in Zurich.
“However, given the euro area weakness, growth will be muted.”  In March, foreign sales, adjusted for inflation and
seasonal swings, declined 2.5 percent from February, when they
gained a revised 12 percent, the customs office said. Imports
increased 4.6 percent and the  trade surplus  narrowed to 1.69
billion Swiss francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
