Ener-G Holdings Plc, a U.K.
renewable-energy developer, completed  Mexico ’s first plant that
captures and converts landfill gases into electricity that’s
sold to a  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  factory.  Ener-G invested 4.4 million pounds ($7.1 million) in the
power plant at the San Nicholas landfill in central Mexico, the
Manchester-based company said in a  statement  today.  The company developed the plant with the city of
Aquascalientes, which owns the 42-hectare (104 acre) landfill,
according to the statement. The plant generates enough
electricity for Nissan to make about 37,000 vehicles a year at
its nearby factory.  “This ambitious project is converting damaging  greenhouse
gases  into renewable power that is benefiting Mexico’s
successful car industry, providing valuable income for the
municipality of Aquascalientes, and benefiting the
environment,” Hugh Richmond, managing director of Ener-G’s
natural power unit, said in the statement.  Nissan makes March, Sentra and Versa cars at the factory.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
