Egypt ’s Foreign Ministry is
“seriously” following the case of an Egyptian citizen detained
in  Saudi Arabia , the state-run news agency reported today, as
his arrest angered activists at home.  Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr has asked the Egyptian
embassy in  Riyadh  to act quickly to learn the details of the
case of Ahmed el-Gizawy, who was detained in Saudi Arabia last
week, and to “work to ensure his release,” the Middle East
News Agency said, citing Amr Roushdi, a ministry spokesman.  The arrest has fueled complaints by activists on social
media about the treatment of Egyptians in Saudi Arabia and
sparked calls for protests outside the Saudi Embassy in Cairo.
Dozens of people gathered at the embassy today demanding el-
Gizawy’s speedy release, MENA reported. Egyptian security
deployed forces to secure the building, the agency said.  Roushdi said the ministry understands the anger, while
urging Egyptians to consider “whether their means of expression
will be in the interest of the detained Egyptian citizen or will
make his situation worse,” MENA reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
