Iran  will boost oil output to 30,000
barrels a day at the Hengam field that it shares with  Oman  after
drilling a fourth well at the site,  Press TV  reported, citing
Iranian Offshore Oil Co.’s managing director.  Authorities expect to complete the well within 10 days at
Hengam, which currently produces 22,000 barrels a day, Mahmoud
Zirakchianzadeh said, according to a report posted on the state-
run news channel’s website yesterday.  Iran has invested about $450 million to develop the first
phase of the field and has allocated $800 million for both
planned phases of the project, Zirakchianzadeh said, without
elaborating. Ten wells need to be operational for the field’s
full development, he said. The Oil Ministry estimates that
Hengam holds more than 700 million barrels of crude and 200
billion cubic feet of natural gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
