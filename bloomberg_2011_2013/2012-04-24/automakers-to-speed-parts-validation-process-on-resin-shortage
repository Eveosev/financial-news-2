Automakers led by  General Motors
Co. (GM)  and  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  drafted a plan to expedite their parts
validation processes as the industry tries to counter a shortage
of resin used for making fuel and braking components.  GM, Volkswagen,  Ford Motor Co. (F)  and Chrysler Group LLC were
among the automakers that developed and support the plan to
speed the use of alternate materials as the industry runs short
of PA-12, also called Nylon-12, according to an e-mailed
statement yesterday by the Automotive Industry Action Group. A
follow-up meeting to approve the plan is scheduled for April 30.  Automakers and their suppliers are studying ways to find
and test alternative materials and avoid losing vehicle output
after the March 31 explosion at chemical maker Evonik Industries
AG, which halved global capacity to make Nylon-12. Evonik’s
Marl,  Germany , factory made a base ingredient used in the resin
called Cyclododecatriene, or CDT, and supplied the material to
other makers of Nylon-12 such as  France ’s  Arkema SA. (AKE)   Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) ,  Kia Motors Corp. (000270) , Honda Motor Co.,
 Harley-Davidson Inc. (HOG)  and  Paccar Inc. (PCAR)  also support the plan to
speed validation of parts, according to yesterday’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
