On a recent visit to Bhubaneswar, the capital of the large eastern state of  Odisha , I found the airport plastered with advertisements and slogans expressing the nurturing, socially conscious side -- caring for the poor, growth with inclusive values, creating happiness -- of the  many steel and aluminum companies  that have major operations in one of India's poorest but most mineral-rich and business-friendly states. The most prominent voice in this cluster belonged to  Vedanta , a London Stock Exchange-listed "globally diversified natural resources group with wide-ranging interests in aluminium, copper, zinc, lead, silver,  iron ore , oil and gas and power," headed by  Anil Agarwal , one of India's richest and most controversial businessmen. Vedanta's main interest in Odisha is represented by its subsidiary company  Vedanta Aluminium , which has over the last decade set up, in the face of  concerted opposition from tribal groups , an alumina refinery in the district of  Lanjigarh , the most bauxite-rich area of a state that has over half of  India 's reserves of that mineral. A Vedanta ad at the airport declared that "Education is the backbone of a rising community," and announced, somewhat improbably, that the company was providing "quality education to all local children across [the districts of] Lanjigarh and Jharsuguda." This month, Vedanta also put up on  YouTube  the last installment of a massive advertising and public-relations campaign it launched at the beginning of the year called " Creating Happiness ." The hub of the campaign was a  90-second ad film  widely played on Indian television this year, telling the story of a girl named Binno in a village in the state of Rajasthan. Made by one of India's most celebrated ad filmmakers,  Piyush Pandey  of  Ogilvy & Mather  India, the film supplies touching scenes from the lives of Binno -- who attends a school supported by Vedanta -- and her brothers. It is accompanied by commentary from a somewhat patronizing male voice asking if the girl's parents had access to the same opportunities, and demonstrating by this comparison that the company was "creating happiness." Alongside the Binno film, the company also announced that it was sponsoring a  Creating Happiness Film Competition  that would invite "film students across the country to visit any of the 550 villages where we have a presence, and find their own Binno." In a piece called " Vedanta touches souls with 'Creating Happiness', " the news platform Exchange4media reported: Fair enough, but there were some inconvenient facts that Pandey omitted to mention, as did most of the media channels that ran the advertisements. The missing facts point to a yawning gulf between the kind of information supplied by advertising, and the kind of information generated by investigative journalism, regulatory bodies, or even states. Were one to place these facts alongside the company's campaign, it would appear that Vedanta is less the leader in sustainable development and social responsibility in India's universe of corporations, and more the  black sheep  of that world. It stands accused of habitually forging ahead with its mining and quarrying operations before the requisite permissions have been granted, and of  dividing and destroying  local economies and fragile ecosystems, such as those in the  hills of Niyamgiri in Lanjigarh , Odisha, with its economic might and ability to influence state policy. To cite only a small number of such inconvenient truths that muddy the company's narrative: In August 2010, India's then-minister for environment and forests,  Jairam Ramesh ,  canceled  Vedanta Alumina's clearances to mine bauxite in the Niyamgiri hills of Odisha. At that time, the  Times of India  reported: And in July 2010,  Peter Popham  reported from Vedanta's annual general meeting in  London : From these testimonies it seems clear that one doesn't have to be a left-wing revolutionary (opponents of Odisha's huge mining projects are routinely tarred as "Maoists" by the government) or a crusader against big business to have serious doubts about Vedanta's approach to law, ethics, transparency and due process. Indeed, it isn't clear that at a time when the world, and especially developing economies, need vast quantities of aluminum and steel, it is realistic to insist (as  Samarendra Das  does in an essay and the prominent Indian writer Arundhati Roy does in her recent book on left-wing extremism, governments and mining in India, " Walking With The Comrades ") that states and societies can agree to "leave the bauxite in the mountain" for good. Even so, it's one thing to accept that mining is a necessary reality. It's quite another to accept the reality of Vedanta's collusion with the government of Odisha to try and pay off tribals to vacate mineral-rich land to generate vast profits. Those profits are only derived from the development of one of India's poorest states. The company then uses the thin gruel of its own corporate social responsibility measures to generate the material for PR campaigns such as the one that swamped India's television screens in January. As Padmaja Shaw wrote last month in the media-analysis website The Hoot, in a piece called " Creating Happiness ?" democracy is reduced to a farce when capital-rich entities are allowed to control the message on a matter of wide-ranging importance merely because they have the cash to control the medium: The  outrage  generated by the ad campaign meant that Benegal and the actress Gul Panag  pulled out  of the Vedanta jury, leaving Pandey as the sole judge. After the student films had been made,  Aman Sethi and Priscilla Jebaraj  reported in the Hindu: Meanwhile, far from the worlds of advertising, PR and industry -- all part of India's booming post-liberalization New Economy, but also responsible for currents and narratives that have made the burgeoning middle class unsympathetic or oblivious to the problems of those beneath them, different from them, or dissenting from them --  the tribals of Niyamgiri are still agitating  to keep their sacred mountains unmolested.
