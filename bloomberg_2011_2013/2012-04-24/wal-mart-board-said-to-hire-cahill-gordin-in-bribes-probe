The audit committee of  Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. (WMT) ’s board has hired New York law firm Cahill, Gordon &
Reindel LLP as legal counsel in its probe of bribery
allegations, said a person familiar with the matter.  Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, said on April 21
that it has been investigating an alleged bribery scheme that
occurred in  Mexico . The audit committee has retained the firm to
assist in investigating the allegations, said the person, who
asked not to be named because the hiring was private. The
committee started the investigation six months ago, Wal-Mart
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
