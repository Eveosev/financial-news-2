Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann
defended the  European Central Bank ’s strategy to urge
governments toward more fiscal austerity amid a deepening
recession and political crises, the  Wall Street Journal 
reported, citing an interview.  “The crisis can only be solved by embarking on often-
painful structural reforms and following up on fiscal
consolidation,” Weidmann told the newspaper. “If policy makers
think they can avoid this, they will try to. That’s why the
pressure has to be kept up.”  Weidmann said he he hasn’t seen “any convincing reason for
myself to embark on a third” three-year refinancing operation,
the Journal reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
