OAO Bashneft fell the most since
its shares started trading on the Micex exchange in November
after the Russian regional oil producer’s board recommended
cutting the dividend payout.  Bashneft shares declined 4.2 percent to 1,618.90 rubles in
Moscow, the lowest close since since Feb. 7.  The board recommended dividends of 99 rubles per common or
preferred share for 2011, Bashneft, controlled by billionaire
Vladimir Evtushenkov’s AFK Sistema, said today in a regulatory
filing. That is 58 percent less than the payout of 235.77 rubles
a share for 2010, according to the company’s website.  “The news is negative, the dividend is much lower than
expectations,” Maria Yegikyan, an analyst at  Alfa Bank  in
Moscow said by phone today.  Shareholders as of May 15 are eligible to vote at the June
29 annual meeting, Bashneft said today in a regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
