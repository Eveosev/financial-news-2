John Hancock  Life Insurance’s
lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase & Co. over residential mortgage-
backed securities was moved to federal court from New York state
court.  John Hancock, a unit of Boston-based  Manulife Financial
Corp. (MFC) , sued New York-based JPMorgan in state  Supreme Court  in
 Manhattan  in January, accusing the bank of fraud tied to the
sale of residential mortgage-backed securities.  Federal courts have jurisdiction because the claims arise
under U.S. law, the case involves international banking or
financial operations, and it is related to bankruptcy
proceedings, according to documents filed by the defendants in
state court today.  John Hancock bought the securities “in reliance on the
false and misleading” statements made by the defendants, which
include Bear Stearns & Co. and Washington Mutual Inc., according
to the complaint. JPMorgan acquired Bear Stearns and WaMu during
the 2008 financial crisis.  The suit seeks unspecified damages for market losses and
principal and interest payments, as well as the cancellation of
contracts and recovery of payments for the investments.  Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
market for the securities evaporated.  The case is John Hancock Life Insurance Co. v.  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM) , 650195/2012, New York State Supreme Court
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
