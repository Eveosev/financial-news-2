Sesa Goa Ltd. (SESA) ,  India ’s biggest
iron-ore exporter, reported a 21 percent decline in fourth-
quarter profit after prices and sales of the steelmaking
ingredient plunged.  Group net income fell to 11.6 billion rupees ($220.5
million) in the three months ended March 31 from 14.6 billion
rupees a year earlier, the Panaji, Goa-based unit of  Vedanta
Resources Plc (VED)  said today in a statement. The median profit
estimate of 25 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 10.4 billion
rupees. Sales declined 23 percent to 30.3 billion rupees.  The cash price of 58 percent-content iron ore delivered to
 Tianjin port  in  China , the biggest consumer, averaged 16 percent
lower in the last quarter from a year earlier, according to
Steel Business Briefing. Output at Sesa’s mines tumbled in the
last quarter because of transport delays in the western state of
Goa and a mining ban in the southern state of Karnataka, it said
in an exchange filing on April 10.  Sesa  shares  rose 0.5 percent to 182.35 rupees at the close
of trade in Mumbai today. The earnings were announced after
market hours.  Total expenses increased 18.4 percent to 18.3 billion
rupees in the period on higher royalty. Raw material costs
gained 9.1 percent to 1.4 billion rupees.  The company’s  iron ore  output fell 11 percent to 4.9
million metric tons in the last quarter, while sales tumbled 21
percent to 5.2 million tons. Sesa halted its Karnataka mine
after the nation’s top court in two separate orders in July and
August banned mining in three iron-ore-rich regions of the
province.  Billionaire Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Resources will combine
its publicly traded Indian units into a new company, the London-
based company said on Feb. 25. Sesa will absorb Sterlite
Industries (India) Ltd. in an all-share deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
