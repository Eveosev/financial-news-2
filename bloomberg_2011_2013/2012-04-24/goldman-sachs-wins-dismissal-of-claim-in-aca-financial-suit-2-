Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  must face
fraud claims brought by ACA Financial Guaranty Corp. over a
mortgage-based investment that led to a settlement with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.  ACA Financial sued Goldman Sachs in New York State  Supreme
Court  in January 2011, accusing the company of fraudulent
inducement, fraudulent concealment and unjust enrichment in
connection with a collateralized debt obligation known as
Abacus.  Justice Barbara Kapnick threw out the unjust enrichment
claim in an order dated yesterday, saying that the plaintiffs
failed to establish that Goldman Sachs wrongly benefited at ACA
Financial’s expense. Kapnick let stand two fraud claims in the
complaint.  “Justice Kapnick vindicated ACA’s position, and rejected
all of Goldman’s arguments opposing ACA’s fraud claims,”  Marc Kasowitz , a lawyer for New York-based ACA, said in an e-mailed
statement. “Full discovery in this case will now proceed.”  ACA seeks $120 million in compensation and punitive damages
for the fraud claims, according to the statement.  Michael DuVally , a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment on yesterday’s ruling.  Goldman Sachs agreed in July 2010 to pay $550 million, the
largest penalty ever assessed by the SEC against a Wall Street
firm, to settle allegations against it involving the Abacus
deal.  The case is ACA Financial v. Goldman Sachs & Co.,
650027/2011, New York state Supreme Court ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
