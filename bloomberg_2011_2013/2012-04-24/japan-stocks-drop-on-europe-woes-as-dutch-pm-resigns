Japanese  shares  dropped for a
fourth day after the Dutch prime minister resigned over
austerity measures, deepening concern over Europe’s debt crisis,
and a leading gauge of China’s economic growth slowed.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that counts Europe as its
biggest market, lost 1.1 percent.  TDK Corp. (6762) , a manufacturer of
electronic parts which gets almost a third of its revenue from
China, declined 0.8 percent. Advantest Corp., the world’s
largest producer of memory-chip testers, rose 4.5 percent on a
report it probably recorded its first profit in three quarters.  “There’s more and more concern that Europe’s efforts to
rein in its debt is hurting its ability to grow,” said  Akio
Yoshino , who helps oversee the equivalent of $31 billion as
chief economist at Amundi Japan Ltd. in Tokyo. “If growth in
the region worsens more than expected, then the effort to deal
with the debt will be overshadowed by the economy’s
contraction.”  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  fell 0.8 percent to 9,468.04
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo. Volume was almost a quarter lower
than the 30-day average. The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index lost 0.7
percent to 803.94, with more than twice as many shares declining
as advancing.  The Topix has fallen 5.6 percent since March 27, as
investors refocused on Europe’s debt crisis and slowing Chinese
growth and a sputtering U.S. recovery weighed on global equities.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  rose 0.3 percent
today. The gauge dropped 0.8 percent in New York yesterday as a
revolt against spending cuts in budget-conscious Netherlands
prompted Prime Minister Mark Rutte to step down. French
President Nicholas Sarkozy lost the first round of his election
bid as concern intensified over Europe’s debt crisis.  Canon slipped 1.1 percent to 3,745 yen.  Sony Corp. (6758) , a
consumer electronics maker that gets more than a fifth of its
revenue in Europe, lost 1.7 percent to 1,330 yen.  Dutch PM Resigns  Rutte’s resignation is “creating an aura of uncertainty
and that’s the last thing that investors need,” said  Angus Gluskie , managing director at White Funds Management in Sydney
who manages more than $350 million. “This is destabilizing for
the markets as a whole. Europe is still really the focus.”  Stocks also declined as a euro-area  composite index  based
on a survey of purchasing managers in the services and
manufacturing industries fell to a five-month low, London-based
Markit Economics said in an initial estimate yesterday.  Companies tied to  China  also dropped after the Conference
Board’s Leading Economic Index for that country rose at a slower
pace in March, adding to evidence growth in the world’s second-
biggest economy is moderating. The gauge tracks data such as
lending activity, consumer expectations and exports.  China Stocks Fall  “China accounts for a quarter of Japan’s exports so if
 China’s economy  weakens it’s a real concern for Japan,” said
Amundi Japan’s Yoshino.  TDK Corp. fell 0.8 percent to 4,270 yen.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , a
maker of robotics for mainland factories, declined 0.8 percent
to 14,410 yen.  Shares also fell as the yen appreciated to as high as 80.86
against the dollar today in Tokyo, compared with 81.31 at the
close of  stock trading  yesterday. Japan’s currency strengthened
to 106.32 against the euro from 107.25. A stronger yen reduces
overseas income at Japanese companies when repatriated.  Advantest Corp. (6857)  gained the most on the Nikkei 225, jumping
4.5 percent to 1,168 yen, after the Nikkei newspaper said its
operating profit probably reached more than 6 billion yen ($74
million) in the quarter ended March, buoyed by growing shipments.  -- With assistance from Adam Haigh in Sydney. Editors:
