The Czech Republicâ€™s  PX (PX)  stock index
jumped the most in two weeks, rising 1.2 percent to 922.10 at
the close in Prague, rebounding from a three-month low.  The following were among the most active  equities  on the
Prague Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  CEZ AS (CEZ)  , the biggest Czech power utility, gained
1.7 percent to 772 koruna, its biggest advance in a week.  New
World Resources Plc (NWR)  , the biggest coking-coal producer,
rebounded from the lowest in almost three years, rising 2.5
percent to 124.5 koruna.  Global stocks rallied on better-than-estimated earnings and
data indicating that the American housing market is stabilizing.  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  , a unit of Societe Generale SA,
added 1.1 percent to 3,350 koruna. It fell 3.1 percent yesterday
to a more than three-month low, driving its 14-day relative
strength index to 25. Readings below 30 suggest to technical
analysis a security may gain. The RSI increased to 30 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
