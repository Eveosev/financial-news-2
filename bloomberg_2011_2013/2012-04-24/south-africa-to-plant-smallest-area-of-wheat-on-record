 South African farmers are expected
to plant the smallest area of wheat on record after prices
dropped, the nation’s Crop Estimates Committee said.  The country will sow 547,200 hectares (1.4 million acres)
of the cereal, 9.5 percent less than the area covered in the
previous season, Marda Scheepers, a spokeswoman for the
committee, said by phone from  Pretoria  today. That would be the
smallest area since at least 1931, when the committee’s records
began, she said. The figure compares with a median estimate of
600,000 hectares by eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  “This is because of low prices and grading regulations,”
she said. “It’s more difficult to get good-quality wheat at
silos.”  Wheat prices have declined 14 percent over the past year on
the Johannesburg-based South African Futures Exchange. Wheat for
May delivery increased 0.5 percent to 2,697 rand ($346) a metric
ton by the noon close. The nation produced 1.43 million tons of
wheat in the 12 months through September, the smallest crop
since 1992, according to Grain South  Africa .  South Africa, which is a net importer of wheat, is sub-
Saharan Africa’s largest producer of the grain and the region’s
third-biggest importer after Nigeria and  Sudan , according to
U.S. Department of Agriculture data on Bloomberg.  ‘High Standards’  “The quality needs for the milling and baking industry are
of high standards,” Jannie de Villiers, Grain SA’s chief
executive officer, said by phone in Pretoria today. “There is a
negative correlation between high standards of wheat and the
yield and this makes it difficult for local farmers to produce
more wheat.”  Imports in the week through April 20 climbed to 60,255
tons, the most since Feb. 24, the Pretoria-based South African
Grain Information Service said on its website today.  The Crop Estimates Committee reduced its forecast for corn
output by 1.6 percent because of persistent drought in growing
areas, Scheepers said.  South Africa , the continent’s biggest corn producer, may
reap 11.1 million tons of corn this season, Scheepers said.  The
country produced 10.4 million tons of corn last year.  The forecast includes 6.4 million tons of white corn and
4.7 million tons of yellow, she said. The total forecast
compares with the committee’s estimate of 11.3 million tons last
month and is above the 11 million-ton median estimate by eight
traders surveyed by Bloomberg.  White corn for July delivery, the most active contract,
rose 1.2 percent to 2,119 rand a ton. Yelllow corn for delivery
in July jumped 1.7 percent to 2,071 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
