Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW) , the
largest maker of artificial heart valves worldwide, said first-
quarter sales rose 14 percent as U.S. doctors began implanting
its Sapien device.  Edwards generated $41 million in U.S.  sales  for Sapien,
which was approved by the  Food and Drug Administration  in
November to replace a failing aortic valve without cracking open
the chest. The Irvine, California-based company reduced its
forecast for Sapien’s 2012 sales by $30 million to $530 million
to $600 million because of an expected delay in approval for
broader U.S. use, European market pressure and foreign exchange
rates, the company said today in a statement.  Net  income  rose to $65.1 million, or 55 cents a share, from
$63.9 million, or 53 cents, a year earlier, the company said
today in a statement. Profit excluding certain items of 53 cents
a share topped the average estimate of 48 cents from 22 analysts
compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue rose to $459.2 million in the
quarter, beating the $449.9 million average  estimate .  “The launch here in the U.S. got off to a slow start in
January, but the momentum built throughout the quarter,” said
Glenn Novarro, an analyst at  RBC Capital Markets  in  New York .
“That’s why the results came in better than expected.
Physicians and hospitals are embracing the technology. The sites
that have launched have healthy waiting lists.”  Edwards  rose  4.2 percent to $76.39 in extended trading at
5:51 p.m. New York time after closing at $73.33. The shares
declined 12 percent in the past 12 months.  FDA Panel  Sapien is approved for patients who can’t tolerate open
heart surgery. Edwards has been working to train more doctors
how to implant the $30,000 device and ensure insurance coverage.
An FDA advisory panel is slated in June to review whether the
device should be allowed for patients who would be eligible,
though at high-risk of complications, for open-heart surgery.  The June panel hearing means the second, broader approval
won’t come until the second half of the year, later than the
company originally anticipated, Novarro said in a telephone
interview. The surgery-eligible U.S. patients aren’t likely to
have access to Sapien until the end of the year, he said.  The company lowered its  forecast  for 2012  earnings 
excluding one-time items to $2.58 a share to $2.68 a share, from
$2.70 to $2.80. Analysts had estimated $2.67 a share.  Sapien Forecast  Sales for 2012 will be at the lower end of the previously
given range of $1.95 billion to $2.05 billion, the company said.
Edwards lowered the top of its range for U.S. Sapien sales to
$200 million to $240 million for 2012, from an earlier estimate
of $200 million to $260 million.  The reduced sales forecast was less than might have been
anticipated for a three-month delay in the next approval because
demand for Sapien among patients who can’t tolerate surgery has
been faster than anticipated, Chief Executive Officer Michael Mussallem said today in a conference call with analysts.  Edwards has trained 60 medical centers to implant Sapien
since it was approved in the U.S., he said. While uncertainly
about insurance reimbursement caused some facilities to postpone
training and delay procedures, others stepped into their slots,
he said.  “Physician and hospital interest in our Sapien program
remains very high,” Mussallem said. “We still expect to train
150 to 250 new commercial sites in the first 12 months.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
