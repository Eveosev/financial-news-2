Wheat gained for the second
straight day on speculation that demand will rise as more of the
grain will be added to livestock feed as corn costs climb.  The price of corn, the main ingredient in U.S.  animal feed ,
rose as much as 1.5 percent today in Chicago after the
government announced overseas sales of 480,000 metric tons to
unknown buyers. With less corn available in the U.S. and prices
rising, some cattle producers in the southern Great Plains will
add wheat to livestock rations, said David Lambert, head of the
agriculture economics department at  Kansas State University  in
Manhattan.  “Wheat would follow a corn rally,”  Larry Glenn , an
analyst at Frontier Ag in Quinter, Kansas, said in a telephone
interview. Prices are rising after the corn export-sales report,
he said.  Wheat futures for July delivery gained 1.7 percent to
$6.435 a bushel at 10:08 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Before today, prices dropped 3.1 percent this year.  Wheat is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $14.4
billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
