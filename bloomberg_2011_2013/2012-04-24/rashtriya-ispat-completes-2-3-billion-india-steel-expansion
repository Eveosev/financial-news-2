Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd., the
smaller of  India ’s two state-owned steelmakers, started a new
blast furnace, completing a $2.3 billion expansion.  The 2.7 million metric-ton-a-year furnace was fired today,
bringing annual plant capacity to 6.3 million tons, Chairman
A.P. Choudhary said in a telephone interview from the southern
city of Vishakhapatnam, where the mill is located.  India’s steelmaking capacity is forecast to increase more
than 7 percent this year to 100 million tons, according to G.K. Basak, executive secretary at the steel ministry’s joint plant
committee. The government plans to spend $1 trillion in the next
five years to build roads,  power plants , railways tracks and
airports to help the economy return to a targeted growth rate of
9 percent.  “Besides urban infrastructure, we see a lot of demand
coming from rural India,” Choudhary said. “We’ll also target
high-end industries like pipes and tubes and auto forging.”  Steel demand in the country is expected to grow 8 percent
this year, higher than the 5.5 percent rate in the previous
year, as lower  interest rates  boost demand for homes,
automobiles and appliances.  India’s central bank last week cut the benchmark repurchase
rate by a greater-than-forecast 50 basis points, seeking to
bolster growth with the first reduction since 2009.  To contact the reporter for this story:
