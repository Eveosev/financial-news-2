The European Union should take
steps to ensure “fair play” for farmers and consumers amid
“abusive” commercial behavior by grocers, the U.K. National
Farmers Union said.  Food  suppliers  that are “economically dependent” on large
retailers have little ability to challenge unfair practices,
according to a  report  e-mailed today and commissioned by the
Warwickshire-based National Farmers Union and other industry
groups. Some retailers have changed contracts retrospectively or
shifted costs onto their suppliers, while a “climate of fear”
has prevented food suppliers from taking retailers to court or
complaining to other authorities.  “Unequal bargaining positions between some retailers and
their suppliers have, arguably, resulted in imbalances in market
power,” according to the report, prepared by Justine Stefanelli
and Philip Marsden of the  British Institute of International and
Comparative Law . “Because suppliers are often economically
dependent on these large retailers, they are often in a very
weak bargaining position and therefore unable to challenge these
practices or recover any resultant losses.”  To contact the reporter for this story:
