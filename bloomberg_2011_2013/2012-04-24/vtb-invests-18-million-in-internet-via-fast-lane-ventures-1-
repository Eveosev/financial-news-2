VTB Capital, the securities unit of
Russia’s second-biggest lender, is investing $18 million in
internet startups by taking a stake in Fast Lane Ventures.  The investment gives VTB an undisclosed minority holding in
Moscow-based Fast Lane, Aidar Kaliev, head of VTB Capital’s
venture capital investments, said in an interview today. “It
gives us a seat on the board and the first refusal to increase
our stake,” Kaliev said.  VTB invested in one of the few domestic technology initial
public offerings of OAO Russian Nautical Technologies in July
2010, which  raised  $85 million on the Micex Stock Exchange.
 Yandex NV (YNDX) , the owner of Russia’s most popular Internet search
engine, raised $1.3 billion in a New York IPO in January this
year. Mail.ru Group Ltd., a Russian investor in Facebook Inc.,
attracted $912 million in its  London  IPO in November 2010.  “We have one or two companies who could be candidates for
IPOs on the  Nasdaq ,” said Kaliev in Moscow. The bank will exit
two investments through trades sales before the end of 2012, he
said.  VTB last month invested $10 million in Oktogo.ru, a Russian
online hotel booking and travel company. The bank has invested
$130 million of its $330 million venture fund in four deals in
Russia and in four companies with “Russian components” in
 Germany ,  Los Angeles  and London.  The lender’s investment strategy is underpinned by
“patriotism and profit,” Kaliev said. “We have invested in
aiHit, an artificial intelligence company, in the U.K. because
its engineers are from Russia and the Ukraine.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
