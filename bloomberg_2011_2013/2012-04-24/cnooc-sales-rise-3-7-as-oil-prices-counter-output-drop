Cnooc Ltd. (883) ,  China ’s biggest
offshore oil and gas explorer, said successes in discovering new
fields in the country will help the company achieve its goal of
as much as 10 percent annual growth in production.  Exploration spending increased 58 percent to 9.64 billion
yuan ($1.5 billion) in the first quarter, helping make five
discoveries and drill as many appraisal wells, Beijing-based
Cnooc said in a statement yesterday. Sales rose 3.7 percent as
higher crude prices countered a 6.3 percent drop in production
after oil spills shut China’s largest field in September.  “The exploration and appraisal success rate achieved (was)
the best for some time,”  Neil Beveridge , a Hong Kong-based
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., said in a research note
after the production report. “The most important catalyst for
Cnooc remains the restart of Penglai 19-3.”  Cnooc has forecast a 2.7 percent increase in production
this year as it plans to start new fields and awaits government
approval to resume operations at Penglai 19-3. Overseas assets,
including shale-gas acreages in  North America , on which the
state-controlled company has  bid  about $9 billion in the last
two years, are supplementing output from Chinese fields.  Cnooc has “made significant progress,” Chief Executive
Officer Li Fanrong said in the statement. “These achievements
will strongly support our production growth target of 6 percent
to 10 percent compound annual growth rate from 2011 to 2015.”  Shares Rise  The explorer’s shares rose 1.1 percent to HK$16.14 at 9:55
a.m. in Hong Kong trading. The stock has declined 19 percent in
the past year, outpacing the 14 percent drop in the benchmark
 Hang Seng Index. (HSI)   Cnooc plans to sell 10- and 30-year bonds denominated in
U.S. dollars, a person familiar with the matter said today,
asking not to be identified because the details are private. The
company plans to issue bonds through a unit for general
corporate purposes, it said in a  statement  earlier, without
giving an amount for the proposed borrowing.  The Penglai 9-1 field, located in the eastern part of Bohai
Bay, is among the biggest oil discoveries in the area in recent
years, Cnooc said April 17. Tests at one appraisal well in the
field produced about 700 barrels of crude oil a day, it said.  Accelerate Development  Cnooc will accelerate the development of the field and
plans to start production in three to five years, Chief
Financial Officer Zhong Hua said on a conference call yesterday.
 Bohai Bay  will be the engine of future output growth, he said,
declining to give an estimate how much oil Penglai 9-1 is likely
to produce.  “While the Penglai 9-1 discovery was exciting, it will not
move the needle on the earnings in the short term,” said Simon Powell, the Hong Kong-based head of Asian Oil and Gas Research
at CLSA Ltd. “Cnooc’s production is going to be flat this year.
The new discoveries will only contribute to the production in
the longer term.”  Oil and gas sales rose to 48.84 billion yuan ($7.7 billion)
in the three months ended March 31, Cnooc said. Output fell to
79.8 million barrels of oil equivalent in the period from 85.4
million barrels a year earlier.  Cnooc, which gets almost all its income from oil and gas
production, doesn’t report first-quarter profit.  Brent oil rose 12 percent to $118.45 a barrel in the first
quarter from a year earlier.  Oil Prices  Cnooc realized an average $120.79 from every barrel of oil,
about 19 percent higher than a year earlier, according to the
statement, while its realized gas price rose 20 percent to $5.88
per thousand cubic feet.  Overseas oil production rose 11 percent to 10.9 million
barrels, Cnooc said. The company said it completed the $1.47
billion acquisition of  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) ’s prospects in  Uganda 
during the quarter.  The Long Lake oil-sands project in  Canada  and the Missan
oilfield in  Iraq  progressed on schedule, the company said.  The explorer lost 62,000 barrels a day after the government
ordered the closure of the Penglai 19-3 oilfield. Cnooc owns 51
percent of the oilfield and operator  ConocoPhillips (COP)  the rest.  CEO Li said last month the field would start this year,
without giving a time frame. CFO Zhong said yesterday the
company is awaiting government approval to resume operations.  Penglai 19-3  Cnooc was forced to cut its 2011 production goal by as much
as 9.3 percent after the field was shut and its $7.1 billion
purchase of  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Argentine unit collapsed in November. The
explorer produced 331.8 million barrels of oil equivalent last
year and its average realized oil price surged 41 percent to
109.75 a barrel, the company said March 28.  The unit of China National Offshore Oil Corp. targets
producing the equivalent of 330 million to 340 million barrels
of oil in 2012.  The energy explorer will start four blocks in the  South
China Sea  this year, Cnooc said March 28, when it reported 2011
earnings. These are Weizhou 6-9/6-10, Yacheng 13-4, Panyu 4-2/5-
1 and Liuhua 4-1 blocks. Weizhou 6-9/6-10 and Yacheng 13-4 are
ready for production, the company said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
