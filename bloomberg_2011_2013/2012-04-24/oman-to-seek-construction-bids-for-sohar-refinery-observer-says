Oman Oil Refineries & Petroleum
Industries Co. plans to seek bids this year for engineering,
procurement and construction work to expand the Persian Gulf
stateâ€™s biggest processing plant, the  Oman Observer  reported.  The project will increase capacity at the 116,400 barrel-a-
day Sohar refinery by about 60,000 barrels, with output to be
exported and also sold locally, the newspaper said, citing Chief
Executive Officer Musab al-Mahrouqi.  Construction is to start next year and be completed in the
first half of 2016, according to the report today. The state-run
company will announce a shortlist of prequalified contractors
within a month, it said. Oman is the largest non-OPEC oil
producer in the  Middle East .  To contact the reporters on this story:
