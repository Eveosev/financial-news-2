Rates for ships that haul dry-bulk
cargoes such as grain and coal advanced as demand to hire the
vessels increased.  Bookings to take grain from  South America  gained 47 percent
from the previous week, according to  Wells Fargo Securities LLC .
Returns for Panamaxes, the largest ships able to transit the
Panama Canal, rose for an 11th straight session, the longest
winning streak since March 26, according to the Baltic Exchange,
a London-based assessor of freight costs.  Ship owners will have to contend with an increase in the
dry-bulk fleet of 13.4 percent this year and 6.2 percent in
2013, according to a Wells Fargo report published today. Growth
in the seaborne dry-bulk trade will slow to 4 percent this year
from 5 percent in 2011, said Wells Fargo, citing data from
Clarkson Research Services, a unit of the world’s largest
shipbroker.  “We expect overall demand growth to remain relatively
modest and insufficient to absorb the oncoming supply of
vessels,” analysts led by New York-based Michael Webber said in
the report.  Panamax rates gained 4.9 percent to $13,008 a day,
according to  Baltic Exchange  data. That was the highest price in
four months. Rates for Supramaxes, about 25 percent smaller than
Panamaxes, gained 2.2 percent to $11,162, the highest price
since Jan. 10. Handysizes, the smallest vessels tracked by the
gauge, added 0.9 percent to $8,617.  Hire costs for Capesize vessels, the largest of the four
ship sizes that are tracked by the gauge, were little changed at
$6,542 a day, the data showed. The Baltic Dry Index increased
2.4 percent to 1,116 today, according to the exchange. That was
the highest level since Jan. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
