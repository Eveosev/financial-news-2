Novartis AG (NOVN) ’s multiple sclerosis
pill Gilenya won final approval from  England ’s health-cost
agency for some patients after the company agreed to a
discounted price.  The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence,
or NICE, recommended Gilenya as a treatment option for some
adults with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, a form of
the disease in which symptoms worsen and improve periodically,
it said in a statement today. The decision confirms a
preliminary ruling made last month.  Gilenya costs about 19,196 pounds ($30,970). NICE isn’t
disclosing the size of the discount that Novartis offered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
