Belgian business confidence dropped
unexpectedly in April, led by deteriorating sentiment in
manufacturing and services.  The  confidence index  for  Belgium  fell to minus 10.7 from
minus 9.6 in March, the Brussels-based  National Bank of Belgium 
said today in an e-mailed statement. Economists projected an
improvement to minus 9.1, the median of 16 forecasts compiled by
Bloomberg.  “As was the case last month, business confidence weakened
in the manufacturing industry,” the central bank said. “After
a rebound in March, the economic climate in business-related
services has also deteriorated. However, after having declined
for two and three months respectively, the building industry
and, more explicitly, trade have recovered in April.”  Picanol NV, a Belgian maker of weaving machines, earlier
this month forecast a drop in first-half revenue and said the
outlook for the second half “remains highly uncertain” because
of “very limited visibility” in the markets in which it
operates.  Belgian  consumer confidence  stabilized in April after the
steepest recovery in eight years a month earlier as households
became more positive about the economic outlook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
