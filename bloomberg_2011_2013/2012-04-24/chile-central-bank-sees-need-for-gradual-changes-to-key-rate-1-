Chile probably will need to make
changes to its  benchmark interest rate  as inflation hovers
around 4 percent in coming months, bank board member Enrique Marshall said.  “Moderate and gradual adjustments to the monetary policy
rate most likely will be required in the course of the year,”
Marshall in a presentation posted on the bank website today.  The bank, which left its key rate at 5 percent for the
third straight month in April, will raise the rate to 5.25
percent by October, according to traders and investors polled
April 10 by the central bank. Inflation, which has breached the
upper limit of the bank’s target for three of the past four
months, will drop to 3.35 percent in April 2013, according to
the poll.  Policy makers target 3 percent annual inflation, plus or
minus 1 percentage point over a two-year horizon. While
inflation dropped to 3.8 percent in March after exceeding 4
percent in December through February, consumer-price gains still
pose a risk in the short term, the central banker said.  Marshall is scheduled to speak in the south-central city of
Chillan today about the central bank’s quarterly economic
estimates that it published on April 3. The quarterly report
also forecast that inflation would remain at about 4 percent in
the first half of 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
