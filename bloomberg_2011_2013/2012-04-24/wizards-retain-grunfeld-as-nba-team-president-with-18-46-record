Ernie Grunfeld will remain
president of the  Washington Wizards  even though the team has an
18-46 record and hasn’t made the National Basketball Association
playoffs for four straight seasons.  Grunfeld’s contract was set to expire at the end of the
season. The Wizards didn’t disclose terms.  “Ernie has led the charge to rebuild and change the
direction of the Wizards and I’m pleased that we will continue
to work together to improve upon what we’ve accomplished,” team
owner  Ted Leonsis  said in a  statement .  Grunfeld, a former front office executive for the NBA’s New
York Knicks and  Milwaukee Bucks , has been with the Wizards since
2003. Leonsis said Grunfeld has almost completely revamped the
Wizards’ roster in the past two years, accumulating and
developing young players while adding veterans and maintaining
salary cap flexibility.  While the Wizards have gone 86-224 over the past four
seasons -- the worst four-year stretch in franchise history --
they have  John Wall , the first overall pick in the 2010 draft,
at point guard and have won their past four games.  Washington last made the playoffs after the 2007-08 season
and hasn’t won a postseason series since 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
