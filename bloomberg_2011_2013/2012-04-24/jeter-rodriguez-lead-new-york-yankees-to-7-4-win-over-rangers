The  New York Yankees  beat the Texas
Rangers 7-4 in a matchup of division leaders as Derek Jeter had
four hits to extend his hitting streak to 13 games and  Alex Rodriguez  belted a three-run homer.  The Yankees scored seven runs over six innings off Rangers
starting pitcher Derek Holland, opening a 7-1 lead last night in
Arlington, Texas. CC Sabathia picked up his second win of the
season by holding Texas to four runs in eight innings.  Rodriguez homered during the Yankeesâ€™ four-run fifth inning
and Jeter added a run-scoring double in the sixth as the Yankees
took the opener of a three-game series to improve their record
to 10-6 on the Major League Baseball season.  Josh Hamilton  hit his eighth homer of the season for the
two-time defending American League-champion Rangers, who fell to
13-4. Texas, which has won its first five series of the season,
hosts the Yankees again tonight.  The San Francisco Giants swept a doubleheader against the
New York Mets yesterday with wins of 6-1 and 7-2.  Tim Lincecum  picked up his first victory of the season for
the Giants in the opening game and Madison Bumgarner held the
Mets to three hits over seven innings to win the nightcap.  Boston halted its five-game losing streak as Cody Ross hit
two home runs, including a solo shot in the top of the ninth
inning, to give the  Red Sox  a 6-5 win against the Minnesota
Twins. Ross also hit a two-run homer in the seventh inning to
help the Red Sox erase a 5-3 deficit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
