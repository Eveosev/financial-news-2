Iraq ’s crude exports from northern
 oil fields  remain halted for a third day due to “a technical
fault” at a pipeline network in neighboring Turkey, the Oil
Ministry said.  Crude oil exports stopped at 7:45 p.m. on April 21 at
station PS3 inside Turkish territory, the ministry said on the
website of the official National Media Center.  Transportation of Iraqi crude through the pipeline, which
terminates at the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan, Turkey, has been
halted at least 13 times since November due to sabotage, bad
weather and technical reasons, according to the ministry.  Iraq normally exports 450,000 to 500,000 barrels a day from
northern oil fields through Turkey. It ships most of its crude
from the south on tankers sailing from the  Persian Gulf .  Iraq pumped an average of 2.81 million barrels a day last
month, the third-largest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, according to Bloomberg estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
