Kenya Electricity Generating Co. (KEGC) ,
the East African nation’s largest power producer, headed for its
biggest gain in five years on bets rainfall across the country
will increase the amount of energy generated.  The stock of KenGen, as the company is known, gained by the
maximum daily limit of 10 percent, the most on a closing basis
since April 2007, to 8.80 shillings by 1:18 p.m. in Nairobi.  “The rally is entirely coincident with the rain,” Aly Khan Satchu, a Nairobi-based independent stock market analyst,
said in a telephone interview today. “The rains have got people
thinking there is a wider margin to be made as they can reduce
the expensive portion of their energy make-up.”  Hydroelectric plants provide about 65 percent of KenGen’s
power generation, according to the company’s  website .  “Heavy rains being experienced in different parts of the
country have resulted into flash floods and lightning leading to
deaths, displacements, massive destruction on property and
infrastructure, destruction of farms, among other impacts,” the
Kenya Red Cross Society said April 27 on a statement on its
 website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
