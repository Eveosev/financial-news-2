Philex Petroleum Corp. (PXP) , an energy
explorer in the Philippines, climbed to a record in Manila
trading on expectation it will expand its natural-gas resources.  The  shares  rose 17 percent to 16.20 pesos at the close, the
highest price since they began trading on Sept. 13. Parent
company  Philex Mining Corp. (PX)  advanced 6.9 percent to 22.35 pesos,
the biggest gain since Sept. 30.  Philex Petroleum’s Forum Energy unit said yesterday it
expects to announce an “improvement” in resources when it
presents data from the  Service Contract 72  exploration area to
the board later this week. Forum Energy has a 70 percent
interest in the project.  Philex Mining Chairman Manuel Pangilinan said in June 2010
that the undeveloped field may be similar in size to Royal Dutch
Shell Plc’s nearby Malampaya deposit, the Philippines’ biggest
gas find. Both are in the  South China Sea , which is subject to a
territorial dispute among nations including China and the
Philippines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
