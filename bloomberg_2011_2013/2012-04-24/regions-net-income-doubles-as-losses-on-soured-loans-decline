Regions Financial Corp. (RF) , the lender
that repaid a $3.5 billion taxpayer bailout this month, reported
first-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates as losses on
bad loans declined.  Net income rose to $199 million, or 11 cents a share, from
$69 million, or 1 cent, a year earlier, the Birmingham, Alabama-
based bank said today in a statement. Excluding a 3 cent per
share loss from professional and legal fees tied to discontinued
operations, earnings were 14 cents. The  average estimate  of 28
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 8 cents a share.  Chief Executive Officer Grayson Hall, 54, had said Regions,
the 10th-largest  U.S. bank  by deposits, would repay the U.S.
Treasury Department’s Troubled Asset Relief Program funds when
the company returned to sustainable profitability. After
reporting six  consecutive  quarters of losses starting in 2009,
the bank reduced soured loans and has posted a profit in five of
the last six periods. Regions cut its provision for loan losses
to $117 million from $482 million last year.  “We achieved several important milestones that position us
well to continue growing,” Hall said in the statement.  Regions paid $593 million in dividends to taxpayers since
receiving the bailout in November 2008, the firm said in a
statement earlier this month. Exiting the bailout means the
lender no longer has to pay $175 million in annual dividends to
the U.S., Regions said. To help repay TARP, Regions sold its
Morgan Keegan & Co. brokerage unit to Raymond James Financial
Inc. this month for total proceeds of $1.2 billion and raised
$900 million in a March stock sale.  Total Loans Decline  Regions rose 2 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $6.09 yesterday in
 New York ,  extending  a 42 percent gain on the shares this year.  Non-interest income decreased 9.7 percent to $524 million
as service charges on deposits fell to $254 million from $287
million and Regions booked $12 million in securities gains
compared with $82 million last year. Non-interest expense
declined to $913 million from $932 million.  Total loans fell to $76.7 billion in the first quarter from
$81.4 billion last year as investor real estate loans dropped 32
percent to $10.1 billion. Net charge-offs declined to $332
million from $481 million.  Regions’s net interest margin, the difference between what
a bank pays to borrow money and what it gets for loans, was
unchanged from last year at 3.09 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
