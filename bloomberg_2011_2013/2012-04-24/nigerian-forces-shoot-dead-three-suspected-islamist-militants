Three suspected members of the
Islamist Boko Haram sect were shot dead by Nigerian military
forces in the northeastern town of Maiduguri, a military
official said.  The militants were killed in a shootout as they were
fleeing the scene of robbery, Colonel Victor Ebhaleme, the field
operations officer of the joint  task force  in Borno state, said
in a phone interview yesterday.  “With the way we are cracking down on the Boko Haram
terrorists, we strongly believe that their end is in sight,” he
said. “Some of them have now resort to armed robbery and other
forms of criminality, but we will surely fish them out.”  Authorities in  Nigeria ,  Africa ’s top oil producer, blame
Boko Haram for a surge of attacks since 2009 against government
buildings and security forces in the mainly Muslim north and
Abuja, the capital. The group claimed responsibility for
multiple blasts and attacks in the city of Kano on Jan. 20 that
killed at least 256 people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
