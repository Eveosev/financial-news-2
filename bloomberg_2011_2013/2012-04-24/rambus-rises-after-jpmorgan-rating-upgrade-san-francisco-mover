Rambus Inc. (RMBS) , a memory-chip designer
that gets most of its revenue from royalties, rose the most
since Feb. 8 after an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised his
rating on the stock.  Rambus  climbed  8.4 percent, or 37.5 cents, to $4.85 in New
York, the stock’s first gain in five days. Paul Coster, an
analyst at JPMorgan, boosted his rating on Rambus to overweight,
the equivalent of a buy, from neutral.  After declining 41 percent this year before today, the
company’s shares are fairly valued and aren’t likely to decline
further, Coster wrote in a note. Rambus’s stock slumped after it
lost a legal dispute with  Micron Technology Inc. (MU)  last year, and
has been dropping since last week, when its second-quarter
earnings forecasts fell short of some estimates, Coster wrote.  Sunnyvale, California-based Rambus licenses chip designs
and seeks royalties on its ownership of technologies fundamental
to computer memory chips. The company has been involved in legal
disputes with memory chipmakers over the validity of its
ownership of that technology for more than a decade.  Rambus stock is down more than 70 percent from its closing
price on Nov. 15, the day before Rambus lost a  jury trial  in
which it alleged that Micron and  Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (000660) 
conspired to prevent its memory chips from becoming an industry
standard.  As Rambus’s legal costs decline, its earnings will improve,
and it has opportunities to bring in additional revenue by
selling its technology into the mobile-device and LED-lighting
markets, Coster wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
