Costa Rica  plans to freeze
government wages for two years and eliminate tax breaks to
utility companies to contain the nation’s budget deficit, Vice
President Luis Liberman said.  The measures will lower the country’s $2 billion fiscal
deficit, and increase revenue by about 0.9 percent of gross
domestic product, according to an e-mailed statement from the
Vice President’s office today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
