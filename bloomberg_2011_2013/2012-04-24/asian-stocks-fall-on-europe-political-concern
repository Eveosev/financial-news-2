Asian  stocks  fell for a fourth day
as political uncertainty in  Europe  sparked concern the region
will struggle to contain its debt crisis.  Sony Corp. (6758) , a consumer electronics company that gets about
a fifth of its sales from Europe, slid 1.7 percent. Paladin
Energy Ltd. sank 6.3 percent in Sydney after the uranium
producer sold convertible notes. Huabao International Holdings
Ltd., a maker of flavors for cigarettes, fell the most on the
regional benchmark after a short-seller questioned its finances.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  fell 0.3 percent to 123.23 as
of 6:37 p.m. in Tokyo. Trading volumes in  Japan  and  Hong Kong 
were at least 14 percent less than the 30-day average, while
those in Shanghai were 45 percent higher. Shares fell after the
resignation of Dutch Prime Minister  Mark Rutte  and French
President Nicolas Sarkozy’s defeat in the first round of his re-
election bid sparked concern European states will struggle to
cut spending.  “It’s a time of a greatly unsettled atmosphere in
Europe,” Quintin Price, the global investment chief for
fundamental equities at BlackRock Inc., said in a Bloomberg
Television interview from Hong Kong. BlackRock has about $3.68
trillion in assets. “You see this resistance to austerity.
Europe continues to be central.”  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  dropped 0.8 percent. South
Korea’s Kospi Index fell 0.5 percent.  China ’s Shanghai Composite
Index was little changed, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index
added 0.3 percent after earlier falling as much as 0.4 percent.  Austerity Measures  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.4 percent
today. The gauge dropped 0.8 percent in  New York  yesterday as a
revolt against spending cuts in budget-conscious Netherlands
prompted Prime Minister Rutte to step down.  The backlash against austerity measures in Europe has
expanded in recent weeks after Spain struggled to meet European
Union-imposed deficit targets and election campaigns in  Greece 
faced anti-austerity rumblings.  “This is destabilizing for the markets as a whole,” said
 Angus Gluskie , managing director at White Funds Management in
Sydney who manages more than $350 million. “Europe is still
really the focus.”  Sony slipped 1.7 percent to 1,330 yen.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a
Japanese camera maker that depends on Europe for almost a third
of its sales, lost 1.1 percent to 3,745 yen. Cosco Pacific Ltd.,
which operates a port in Greece, dropped 0.9 percent to HK$10.98
in Hong Kong.  Paladin Drops  Among mining stocks, Paladin Energy sank 6.3 percent to
A$1.575 in Sydney. The company sold $274 million of five-year
convertible notes to help finance debt maturing next year.  Newcrest Mining Ltd. dropped 3.6 percent to A$26.60, the
lowest since December 2008, after Australia’s biggest gold miner
cut its full-year production target after heavy rain at its
mines reduced output, missing analyst estimates.  Huabao International slumped 8.1 percent to HK$3.98. A
report by Anonymous Analytics posted on its website said Huabao
consistently reported margins of more than 70 percent, while its
industry peers were in the 40 percent to 50 percent range.
Industry sources are saying it shouldn’t be possible for a
company with “questionably low” research and development
spending to report “absurdly” high margins, the report said.  United Phosphorus Ltd. retreated 6 percent to 120.05 rupees
in Mumbai after India’s competition regulator imposed a 2.52
billion rupee ($48 million) penalty on the nation’s largest
pesticide maker and two of its rivals. Paladin Energy sank 6.3
percent to A$1.575 in Sydney. The company sold $274 million of
five-year convertible notes to help finance debt maturing next
year.  Australia Rate Speculation  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index added 0.2 percent, having
swung between gains as much as 0.5 percent and losses of up to
0.3 percent. A report showed consumer prices rose less than
economists forecast in the first quarter, boosting bets Reserve
Bank Governor  Glenn Stevens  will reduce the 4.25 percent
benchmark interest rate next week.  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) , the nation’s second-largest lender
by market value, gained 1.5 percent to A$22.47. Australia and
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., the third-biggest, rose 1.1
percent to A$23.72.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained about 8.5 percent this
year through yesterday, compared with a 8.7 percent advance by
the  S&P 500  and a 3 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600
Index. Stocks in the Asian benchmark were valued at 12.6 times
 estimated earnings  on average, compared with 13 times for the
S&P 500 and 10.5 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporter on this story:
