Securities and Exchange Commission
Chairman  Mary Schapiro  will use an appearance before a
congressional panel tomorrow to press lawmakers for a $245
million increase in the agency’s fiscal 2013 funding.  In testimony prepared for the House Financial Services
capital markets subcommittee, Schapiro said her request for a
$1.57 billion fiscal 2013 appropriation would allow the SEC to
hire additional examiners. The money would also help the agency
implement provisions of the 2010 financial regulatory overhaul
and a recently enacted law that eases securities laws for
closely held firms and newly public companies, she said.  “As we continue to implement the Dodd-Frank Act and begin
our JOBS Act rule making, we will need additional resources,
including new subject matter experts, to make the transition to
new rule regimes as smooth as possible and to streamline
existing processes for market participants while still
maintaining essential protections for investors,” Schapiro said
in prepared  testimony .  Schapiro’s budget request will face skepticism among
Republican lawmakers on the subcommittee, including
Representative  Scott Garrett , the panel’s chairman. The New
Jersey Republican has criticized the SEC for not doing enough to
determine the cost of its regulations on business and has
introduced legislation that would require the agency to conduct
a more thorough cost-benefit analysis of its rules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
