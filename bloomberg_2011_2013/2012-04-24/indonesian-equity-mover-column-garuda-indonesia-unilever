Shares of the following companies
had  unusual  moves in  Indonesian trading . Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close in Jakarta.  The  Jakarta Composite Index (JCI)  rose 0.4 percent to 4,170.35.  Bakrie Group-related companies:  PT Bumi Resources (BUMI)  ,  Indonesia ’s biggest coal producer, gained 4.3 percent to
2,075 rupiah.  PT Bakrieland Development (ELTY)  , a property
developer, advanced 3.4 percent to 122 rupiah.  PT Energi Mega
Persada (ENRG)  , Indonesia’s second-biggest listed oil
company, climbed 2.1 percent to 196 rupiah.  PT Bakrie & Brothers (BNBR) , an Indonesian family palm oil-to-
property empire founded in 1942, needs to raise about $100
million in cash by the end of this week as loan collateral, a
person familiar with the matter said. The news eased concern
that the group had received a default notice, as earlier
reported by the Financial Times, said John Teja, a director at
PT Ciptadana Securities in Jakarta.  PT Garuda Indonesia (GIAA)  , the national flag carrier,
jumped 6.4 percent to 670 rupiah. PT Bahana Securities, PT
Danareksa Sekuritas and PT Mandiri Sekuritas may raise about 1.5
trillion rupiah ($163 million) selling a 10.8 percent stake in
the state-owned airline at a price of 620 rupiah to 650 rupiah a
share, Investor Daily Indonesia reported, citing Pandu Djajanto,
a deputy to the state enterprises minister. The transaction is
expected to be completed by April 26, the report said. Djajanto
didn’t return two calls to his mobile phone. Garuda President
Director Emirsyah Satar and Finance Director Elisa Lumbantoruan
said they’re not aware of the stake sale as the company isn’t
involved in the process.  PT Unilever Indonesia (UNVR)  , the nation’s biggest
detergent maker, gained 1 percent to 19,500 rupiah. Unilever
plans to build a $100 million plant in Sumatra to make
sustainable palm-kernel oil, the Wall Street Journal reported,
without saying where it got the information. Three calls to
Unilever’s office in Jakarta weren’t answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
