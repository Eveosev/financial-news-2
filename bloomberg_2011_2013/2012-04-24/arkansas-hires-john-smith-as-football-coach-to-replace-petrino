The  University of Arkansas  hired
John L. Smith as its football coach to replace Bobby Petrino,
who was fired two weeks ago.  Smith, 63, is entering his 40th year of coaching and has a
132-86 record in 18 seasons as a head coach at Weber State,
Michigan State, Louisville, Utah State and  Idaho . He agreed to a
10-month contract worth $850,000 and will be introduced at an
on-campus news conference today in Fayetteville, Arkansas, the
school said in a press release.  “Coach Smith brings a wealth of football knowledge, BCS
conference head coaching experience, passion for the game and a
close familiarity with the current team and coaching staff,”
Athletics Director Jeff Long said.  Smith was the Razorbacks’ special teams coordinator and
outside linebackers coach for the 2009-11 seasons before leaving
for Weber State.  Petrino was fired by  Arkansas  after he was injured in a
motorcycle accident and then covered up the fact that a female
football staff member also was on the bike. Petrino had a 34-17
record in four seasons at Arkansas.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
