Israel ’s short-term government
bonds fell, driving yields to the highest in more than two
weeks, after the central bank held borrowing costs for a third
month amid concern Europe’s fiscal crisis is spreading.  The yield on the 5 percent notes due March 2013 rose four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 2.64 percent, at
11:35 a.m. in Tel Aviv, matching the high on April 5. Shorter-
term maturities are typically more sensitive to rate
fluctuations.  One-year interest rate swaps , an indicator of
investor expectations for the benchmark rate in the period, were
unchanged at 2.58 percent.  The Bank of Israel’s monetary policy committee, led by
Governor  Stanley Fischer , left the  benchmark lending rate  at 2.5
percent citing concerns over a “renewed worsening” of the debt
crisis in  Europe  this month. All 23 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg forecast the decision. Exports account for about 40
percent of gross domestic product, with Europe and the U.S. the
largest markets.  “A deterioration of the debt crisis in Europe will have an
impact on Israel’s export-driven economy,” said Amir Haik,
chief economist at Union Bank of Israel Ltd., in Tel Aviv. “As
a result the central bank is not likely to start raising rates
in coming months but leave them on hold which is pushing yields
on shorter-term bonds higher.”  The yield on the 5.5 Mimshal Shiklit notes due January 2022
rose one basis point to 4.69 percent. The two-year break-even
rate, the yield difference between the inflation-linked bond and
fixed-rate government bonds of similar maturity, rose one basis
point to 294. That implies an average annual inflation rate of
about 2.94 percent.  The  Tel Aviv  Bond 40 Index, which measures inflation-linked
and fixed-rate corporate bonds, was little changed at 267.33.
The shekel gained 0.1 percent to 3.7588 a dollar, trimming this
month’s decline to 1.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
