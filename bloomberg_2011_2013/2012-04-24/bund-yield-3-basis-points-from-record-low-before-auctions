Dutch bonds rose for the first time
in four days as the nation sold 2 billion euros ($2.63 billion)
of debt amid optimism the collapse of its government yesterday
won’t derail efforts to implement budget cuts.  Two-year Dutch yields dropped the most in almost five
months as the government auctioned securities due in 2014 and
2037. Spanish  bonds  gained as the country sold close to its
maximum target at a bill sale. German bunds fell, pushing 10-
year yields up from yesterday’s record low, as stocks gained and
a report showed U.S. new home sales were stronger than
economists forecast, undermining demand for the safest assets.  “We are comfortable now that this is out of the way, this
is not the start of a sustained spread widening,”  David Schnautz , a fixed-income strategist at Commerzbank AG in  London ,
said of the Dutch bond sale. “There’s a lot of hype regarding
the Netherlands and this was exacerbated by the looming supply.
The commitment to fiscal prudence is very high across the Dutch
political spectrum.”  The Dutch  two-year yield  declined 16 basis points, or 0.16
percentage points, to 0.36 percent at 4:24 p.m. London time
after falling as much as 18 basis points, the most since Nov 30.
The 15 percent security due in January 2014 rose 0.265, or 2.65
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 101.100.  The Dutch  10-year yield  declined nine basis points to 2.33
percent after advancing to 2.47 percent, the highest level since
March 28. The extra  yield  investors demand to hold the
securities instead of similar-maturity German bunds shrank 15
basis points to 64 basis points after closing yesterday at the
widest since March 2009.  Dutch Sale  The Dutch  finance ministry  sold 1 billion euros of 3.75
percent bonds due July 2014 at an average yield of 0.523
percent, and 995 million euros of 4 percent bonds due January
2037 at 2.782 percent.  The Sox  Europe  600  Index (SXXP)  gained 1.1 percent, and the euro
strengthened versus all but two of its major counterparts.  Spanish bonds advanced as the nation sold 1.9 billion euros
of bills, compared with a maximum target of 2 billion euros. The
three-month securities were auctioned at an average rate of
0.634 percent, versus 0.381 percent on March 27, the Bank of
Spain said. The government sold six-month bills at 1.58 percent,
up from 0.836 percent.  Spanish  two-year note  yields declined 18 basis points to
3.4 percent.  Italian notes also gained as the nation auctioned 2.5
billion euros of zero-coupon notes. The two-year yield dropped
10 basis points to 3.29 percent.  Seeking Support  Dutch Prime Minister  Mark Rutte  told politicians to face up
to the country’s economic woes to ensure the Netherlands evades
the debt crisis, as opposition lawmakers said there was no need
to stick to budget targets.  Rutte, addressing parliament in The Hague less than 24
hours after he tendered his Cabinet’s resignation, said the need
to adopt measures “hasn’t diminished” after Geert Wilders’s
 Freedom Party  pulled out of budget talks on April 21, ending its
support for the minority government.  Since Europe’s debt crisis began, leaders have been ousted
in Ireland,  Portugal ,  Greece ,  Italy , Spain, Slovenia, Slovakia
and  Finland .  `Headline Risk'  German  10-year yields  rose six basis points to 1.7 percent
after dropping to an all-time low of 1.633 percent yesterday.
Five-year yields climbed six basis points to 0.67 percent.  “We’re so close to records that it’s difficult to just
move along, so I’m not surprised to see a rise in bond yields,”
said Marius Daheim, a senior fixed-income strategist at
 Bayerische Landesbank  in Munich. “The headline risk from the
European debt crisis will probably still support the market. I
don’t see any major changes there.”  U.S.  new home sales  declined 7.1 percent to an annual rate
of 328,000 in March, the Commerce Department said in  Washington .
Economists forecast a rate of 319,000, according to a Bloomberg
News survey. The median selling price increase from a year ago,
the data showed.  Germany ’s central bank isn’t preparing for the euro’s
demise, Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said, rejecting
comments by billionaire  George Soros  in Berlin on April 12.  Bund Futures  German bund futures fell 0.4 percent to 140.61, after
rising to a record 141.37 yesterday.  “In technical terms, there is nothing to prevent a
continuation of the bund future’s ascent,” Viola Stork and
Ulrich Wortberg, fixed-income analysts at Helaba Landesbank
Hessen-Thueringen in  Frankfurt , wrote in a note to investors.
The next resistance level is around 141.50, they wrote. The
first supports, where buy orders may be, are located at 140.44
and 139.82, according to the analysts. Resistance refers to an
area where buy orders may be grouped.  German bonds returned 1.4 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Dutch securities dropped 0.4
percent, and  Spain ’s slid 2.1 percent, the indexes show.  Volatility in Dutch securities was the highest of 24
developed-nation markets, followed by Spain and Germany,
according to measures of 10-year bonds, two- and 10-year yield
spreads and credit-default swaps compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
