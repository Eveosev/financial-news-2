Greece  will pay 20 percent less to
hold a general election on May 6 than it cost in 2009, as the
government tries to cut down on spending in a second year of
austerity measures.  The May 6 vote will cost more than 60 million euros ($79
million), according to initial estimates by the country’s
 Interior Ministry . Greece’s  Supreme Court  will announce tomorrow
those parties taking part in the election.  A total 9.85 million citizens are eligible to vote in one
of the 20,560 polling stations in the country, that is 360,000
more than in 2009, Interior Minister Tassos Yannitsis said at  a
press conference in Athens today.  Vote counting and data processing will be handled by Greek
computer software and services company SingularLogic SA at a
cost of 2.5 million euros, compared to 3 million euros in 2009,
Yiannitsis said. SingularLogic has been in charge of the
country’s elections data collection, process and distribution
since 1981.  The software distributor will give an initial estimate of
the final result at about 9:30 p.m., Chief Executive Officer
Marica Labrou told reporters in  Athens  today. The estimate will
be based on half of all votes cast from 5,000 voting points,
Labrou said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
