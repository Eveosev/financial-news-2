The Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority is proposing to raise fees on the brokerages it
oversees to offset a “significant loss” of revenue during
fiscal 2011.  The changes would include a 25 percent increase in trading
fees, higher levies for FINRA’s advertising compliance reviews,
and new fees for first-time members and membership applications.
The new assessments were described in a  letter  posted on the
regulator’s website from  Richard Ketchum , FINRA’s chairman and
chief executive.  Lower trading volumes and revenues for the industry
resulted in less money being collected by the regulator, Ketchum
said in the letter, which did not say by how much FINRA’s income
fell. By the end of 2013, Ketchum said, he expects the agency to
have cut costs by $60 million.  “The cost of meeting our regulatory mandate is still
expected to outpace our revenues,” Ketchum said. The goal is to
“ensure that we are sufficiently capitalized to meet our
regulatory responsibilities so that we can best protect
investors.”  FINRA is an independent regulator that oversees more than
4,000 brokerages. Its rules, including the revised fee
structure, must be approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission.  FINRA spokeswoman  Nancy Condon  said the scope of the loss
will become clear when the agency’s audited financial report is
released in June.  As part of its cost-cutting effort, FINRA is relocating its
enforcement division from its Washington headquarters to a
facility in nearby Rockville,  Maryland , Condon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
