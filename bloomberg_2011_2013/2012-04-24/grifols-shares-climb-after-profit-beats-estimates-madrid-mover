Grifols SA (GRF) ,  Europe ’s largest maker
of blood-plasma products, rose the most in more than a year in
Madrid trading after first-quarter sales and net income beat
analyst estimates.  Grifols jumped as much as 8.5 percent, the biggest intraday
gain since February 2011, and traded up 7 percent at 17.75 euros
as of 11:50 a.m., valuing the Barcelona-based company at 5.25
billion euros ($6.9 billion). It was the best performer on the
benchmark IBEX 35 Index today.  First-quarter sales jumped to 666.7 million euros from
261.4 million euros a year earlier after the acquisition of
Talecris Biotherapeutics Holdings Corp., Grifols said today in a
 statement . Net income was 67.5 million euros. Analysts predicted
revenue of 616 million euros and profit of 51.8 million euros,
based on the average of  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization increased to 202.6 million euros from 64.8 million
euros, taking into account expenses related to the acquisition
of Talecris and other non-recurring costs. Grifols bought U.S.-
based Talecris for about $4 billion.  “Earnings were very good and in our opinion the goal of
reaching 700 million euros in Ebitda this year is very
conservative,” Luis de Blas, a Madrid-based analyst at Banesto
Bolsa, wrote in a report to investors today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
