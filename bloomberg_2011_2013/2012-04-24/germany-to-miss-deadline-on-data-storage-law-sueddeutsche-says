Germany  will miss an April 26
European Commission deadline to introduce a new law on storage
of personal data,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported, citing Justice
Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger.  The delay in drafting the new rules, a result of
disagreement between Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger and Interior
Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich, will probably trigger proceedings
at the European Court of Justice against Germany, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
