George Zimmerman, the man accused
of killing 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Sanford,  Florida , asked
a judge to allow him to enter a plea of not guilty and waive
arraignment on a murder charge, according to an April 16 court
filing made public today.  Zimmerman, 28, fatally shot 17-year-old Martin on Feb. 26
in the central-Florida town north of  Orlando . He claimed
he shot him in self-defense, according to police. He was charged
with second-degree murder on April 11, following protests in
several U.S. cities demanding he be prosecuted.  Zimmerman was released from jail yesterday after posting a
$150,000 bond and being fitted with a monitoring device.  Jackelyn Barnard, a spokeswoman for Florida state attorney
Angela Corey, didnâ€™t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment on the April 16 filing.  The case is State of Florida v. Zimmerman, 1712FO4573,
Florida Circuit Court of the 18th Judicial Circuit (Seminole
County).  To contact the reporter on this story:
