Swedbank AB (SWEDA) , the largest lender in
the Baltic region, raised its 2013 economic-growth forecasts for
Estonia,  Latvia  and  Lithuania , citing a better outlook for
global demand.  Estonia’s economy will probably expand 4.2 percent next
year, compared with a January forecast of 4 percent, the bank
said in an e-mailed report today. Latvia’s economy may grow 3.5
in 2013, while Lithuania’s gross domestic product may expand 4.3
percent, it said.  The bank also raised Latvia’s 2012 growth forecast to 2.5
percent from a previous estimate of 2 percent, the report said.  Swedbank also said Lithuanian chances to qualify for euro
adoption as planned in 2014 have “significantly narrowed”
because of consumer-price growth. The country is more likely to
switch currencies in 2015, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
