Italy  was forced to pay 1
percentage point more than a month ago to sell zero-coupon bonds
in the first auction since Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s
government moved back its balanced-budget target.  The Treasury sold 2.5 billion euros ($3.3 billion) of the
zero-coupon 2014 debt to yield 3.355 percent, up from 2.352
percent at the previous auction on March 27. Investors bid for
1.80 times the amount offered, down from 1.86 times last month.
The Rome-based Treasury also sold 943 million euros of
inflation-linked bonds due in 2017 and 2019 to yield 3.88
percent and 4.32 percent, respectively. The auction’s maximum
target was 3.5 billion euros.  Investor confidence in the debt of  Europe ’s so-called
peripheral countries has eroded since Spain’s announcement on
March 2 it won’t meet its deficit target this year, leading to
six weeks of declines of Italian bonds. Monti last week delayed
its goal to erase the deficit by one year to 2014, joining Spain
in missing fiscal targets amid a worsening recession.  “The yields were higher than last month, but there was no
overshooting and all in all the sales went quite well,” said
Annalisa Piazza, a fixed-income strategist at Newedge Group in
 London . “The zero-coupon bonds are usually requested by
domestic investors, which explains the fact that the bid-to-
cover ratio was in line with the most recent auctions.”  Spanish Sale  Italy’s 10-year bond, which initially rose after the
auction, pared the gains to yield 5.74 percent at 12:09 p.m.
Rome time, pushing the difference or spread with similar-
maturing German debt to 407 basis points. That compares with 372
basis points the day before Monti announced new budget forecasts
on April 18.  Spain  sold 1.9 billion euros of bills, missing the maximum
target even after reducing the goal, and its borrowing costs
almost doubled. The country’s 10-year bond yield was 5.91
percent after the auction, compared with 6 percent yesterday.
The gap between Spanish and German bond yields narrowed to 423
basis points.  “Italy’s edge over Spain right now is that its domestic
banks appear to be in a stronger position to support their
sovereign,” Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro
Sovereign Strategy in London, said in an e-mailed note. “The
flip side to this argument is that, given Italy’s much larger
funding requirements, there is even more pressure on local banks
to prop up its  bond market .”  To contact the reporters on this story:
