SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc. (SSNC) 
extended the deadline for  GlobeOp Financial Services SA (GO/) 
investors to accept its 572 million-pound ($922 million) offer
after owners of 24.9 percent of the company accepted it.  SS&C, a Windsor, Connecticut-based developer of software
for financial firms, gave investors until May 8 to accept,
according to a statement today.  The company offered 485 pence a share in cash for the
hedge-fund administrator on March 14, trumping an earlier offer
of 435 pence a share from private equity firm TPG Capital. TPG
said this week it wonâ€™t improve its offer.  The stock closed yesterday at 482.75 pence in London
trading. The shares closed at 293 pence on Jan. 5, the day
before GlobeOp said it was in talks to be acquired.  To contact the reporter on this story:
