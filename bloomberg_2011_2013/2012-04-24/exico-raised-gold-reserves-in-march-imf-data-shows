Mexico  added 16.8 metric tons of
gold valued at about $906.4 million to its reserves in March as
nations including  Turkey , Russia and  Kazakhstan  increased their
holdings of the metal, International Monetary Fund data show.  Mexico raised its reserves to 122.6 tons last month when
gold averaged $1,676.67 an ounce, data on the IMF’s website
showed. Turkey added 11.5 tons, Kazakhstan 4.3 tons, Ukraine 1.2
tons, Tajikistan 0.4 ton, and Belarus 0.1 ton, according to the
IMF. The data shows Russia boosted gold reserves by about 16.5
tons after its central bank said on April 20 they were higher.
The  Czech Republic  reduced bullion reserves by 0.1 ton.  Central banks are expanding reserves after the metal
climbed the past 11 years and holdings in  exchange-traded
products  are about 0.7 percent below last month’s all-time high.
The banks added 439.7 tons last year, the most in almost five
decades, and may buy a similar amount in 2012, the London-based
World Gold Council estimates. Gold reached a record $1,921.15 in
September.  “We expect that the recent trend of the official sector
being a net buyer will continue in the medium and long term,”
said Bayram Dincer, an analyst at LGT Capital Management in
Pfaeffikon,  Switzerland . “Gold will continue to be a preferred
central bank reserve asset. It is currency protection and
stabilization.”  Gold for immediate delivery traded at $1,637.50 by 8:27
a.m. in  London  for a 4.7 percent gain this year. The Standard &
Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities climbed 4.6 percent and MSCI
All-Country World Index of equities rose 7.5 percent. Treasuries
rose 0.2 percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.  Turkish Reserves  Turkey’s central bank increased the proportion of required
reserves that commercial banks can deposit in gold last year.
The changes have increased the amount of bullion the country,
which owns 209.6 tons, declares in its official reserves.  Russia 
cut its holding in February for the first time in five years.
It’s reserves are at about 895.7 tons, the IMF data show.  Gold accounts for about 3.9 percent of Mexico’s total
reserves and 9.7 percent of Russia’s, according to the World
Gold Council. That compares with more than 70 percent for the
U.S. and  Germany , the biggest bullion holders, the data show.  To contact the reporters for this story:
