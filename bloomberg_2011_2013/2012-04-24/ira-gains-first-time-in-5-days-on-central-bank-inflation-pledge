The lira advanced for the first
time in five days to its highest level in three weeks after the
 Turkish central bank  vowed new measures to more than halve the
inflation rate over the next year.  The lira gained 0.7 percent to 1.7831 per dollar by 5:42
p.m. in Istanbul, the strongest since April 3. That took the
currency’s appreciation this year to 6.1 percent. The  yield  on
two-year benchmark debt dropped two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 9.45 percent.  The central bank is committed to reducing inflation to 5
percent by mid-2013 and the regulator will reveal new measures
on April 26, Governor Erdem Basci said in an interview with
Bloomberg HT on April 21 on the sidelines of the International
Monetary Fund meeting in  Washington . Turkey’s  inflation  rate
held at 10.4 percent last month, close to a three-year high and
the steepest among major  emerging markets  worldwide after
Argentina’s.  “The central bank’s stance is very clear and we are seeing
real money interest,” Henza Tukel, a currency trader at  Turk
Ekonomi Bankasi AS (TEBNK) , said in e-mailed comments.  Inflation will peak this month before slowing in May, Basci
said in an e-mailed statement on April 21. The central bank is
due to release its inflation report at a press conference April
26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
