The price of  polysilicon , the raw
material used to make most solar panels, fell 3 percent last
week, its seventh consecutive weekly drop, Bloomberg New Energy
Finance data shows.  The average spot price of the material was $24.27 per
kilogram compared with $25.04 a week earlier, a survey by the
London-based research firm showed today. The price, which slid
almost two-thirds during 2011, is down 11 percent this year to
its lowest level since at least 2002 due to oversupply.  To contact the reporter on this story:
