U.S. stocks advanced, following
yesterday’s decline in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, amid
better-than-estimated earnings at companies from AT&T Inc. to  3M (MMM) 
Co. and as data indicated the housing market is stabilizing.  AT&T, the largest U.S. telephone company, and 3M, the maker
of Post-it Notes, rose at least 1.5 percent. International
Business Machines Corp. added 0.7 percent after the company
boosted its buyback plan by $7 billion and raised its dividend.
Juniper Networks Inc. increased 7.2 percent as revenue beat
analysts’ projections.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  jumped 7.5 percent at 5 p.m.
New York time as profit almost doubled last quarter.  The S&P 500 rose 0.4 percent to 1,371.97 at 4 p.m. New York
time. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  added 74.39 points, or
0.6 percent, to 13,001.56. The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 0.3
percent to 2,961.60. About 6.2 billion shares changed hands on
U.S. exchanges, or 7.8 percent below the three-month average.  “Stocks have room to move higher,” said  David Kelly , who
helps oversee about $394 billion as chief market strategist at
JPMorgan Funds in New York. “Earnings are healthy. The bar has
been lowered so far that you can just walk over it. Housing is
on the mend. A sign of a market top is when people are
exuberant. There’s no exuberance as witnessed yesterday.”  Equities rebounded from yesterday’s slump, extending this
year’s rally in the  S&P 500  to 9.1 percent. Earnings per share
beat forecasts at 82 percent of S&P 500 companies that reported
 results  since April 10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Per-share profits grew 3.3 percent in the first-quarter,
Bloomberg data show. That’s up from the 0.8 percent growth
projection before the earnings season started.  Economic Data  Economic optimism helped fuel gains today as new home sales
data indicated that cheaper borrowing costs are helping
stabilize the real estate market. Federal Open Market Committee
members began a two-day meeting today and tomorrow will probably
repeat their plan to keep the benchmark  interest rate  low at
least through late 2014, economists say.  A gauge of  homebuilders  in S&P indexes jumped 2.4 percent.
D.R. Horton Inc., the largest U.S. homebuilder by volume, rose
3.2 percent to $15.54. KB Home added 4.5 percent to $7.91.  Phone shares had the biggest gain among 10 S&P 500 groups,
rallying 2.8 percent.  AT&T (T)  added 3.6 percent to $31.72. Earnings
beat estimates on lower smartphone upgrade costs and an increase
in wireless data sales related to Apple’s iPad.  3M increased 1.6 percent to $88.49. The U.S. market drove
sales at the industrial and  transportation  unit, the largest
division at the  St. Paul , Minnesota-based company.  IBM’s Dividend  IBM (IBM)  gained 0.7 percent to $200. The quarterly payout will
rise 10 cents to 85 cents a share. IBM had $5.7 billion
remaining from a previous buyback plan, bringing the total
available for repurchases to $12.7 billion.  Technology companies are approaching consumer staples as
the largest dividend payers, according data compiled by  Howard Silverblatt , S&P’s New York-based senior index analyst. The
technology group contributes about 14 percent of the S&P 500’s
dividends, up from 5.1 percent in 2004. Consumer staples
companies account for almost 15 percent.  Apple gained 7.5 percent to $602.25 after the close of
regular trading. Net income in the fiscal second quarter climbed
to $11.6 billion, or $12.30 a share, as revenue increased 59
percent to $39.2 billion. Analysts had predicted profit of
$10.02 a share on revenue of $36.9 billion.  Chief Executive Officer  Tim Cook  is increasingly relying on
regions outside the U.S. for  sales  growth. That helped make up
for sales declines from the previous quarter at the top U.S.
mobile-phone carriers,  Verizon Wireless  and AT&T. It also
quelled speculation that Apple’s growth pace may slacken.  ‘Fast-Growing Region’  “China has been a very fast-growing region for them,”
said Abhey Lamba, an analyst at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in
New York. “There’s more disposable income, strong demand for
high-end products and their penetration has been very low in
that market. They have been highlighting that region as one of
their focus areas.”  The company’s shares slumped 2 percent to $560.28 today,
dropping for a fifth straight day. Motorola Mobility Holdings
Inc. won a partial U.S. International Trade Commission judge’s
ruling in its bid to block imports of Apple’s devices including
the iPhone and iPad tablet computer.  Juniper (JNPR)  Networks climbed 7.2 percent to $21.63. Results
suggest that demand from cable companies and other  Internet
service providers  for Juniper’s switches and routers may be
improving, said  Brian Marshall , an analyst at ISI Group.  Wal-Mart Slumps  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  slumped 3 percent to $57.77. The
shares dropped 7.5 percent in two days, the most since January
2009. The retailer is investigating allegations that executives
in Mexico paid more than $24 million in bribes to speed
expansion there. The company also is the subject of a U.S.
Justice Department criminal investigation, a person familiar
with the probe said yesterday.  Big Lots Inc. (BIG)  plunged 24 percent, the biggest decline in
the S&P 500, to $34.71. The discontinued-merchandise retailer
with more than 1,400 U.S. stores reduced its fiscal first-
quarter  sales forecast  amid lower demand for electronics.  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  tumbled 14 percent to $87.68. The world’s
largest video-subscription service projected a slowdown in
growth of U.S. streaming customers.  Coach Inc. (COH)  lost 4.3 percent to $71.87. The largest U.S.
luxury handbag maker reported fiscal third-quarter sales that
beat analysts’ estimates by the smallest margin in 11 quarters.  Slower Growth  Companies’ failure to boost forecasts for future profits
and sales will weigh on the S&P 500 as investors project slower
growth, according to Barclays Plc’s Barry Knapp.  Knapp predicts the S&P 500 will end the year at 1,330, 4
percent below the average forecast of 11 strategists surveyed by
Bloomberg as of April 16. He forecasts combined profit by S&P
500 companies will be $103 a share this year. Analysts that
cover companies in the index  estimate  earnings of $104.86 in
2012 and $118.06 in 2013, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Guidance is not moving higher and as a result, even where
companies are beating estimates, the stocks still aren’t going
up,” Knapp, the New York-based head of equity strategy at
Barclays, said in a radio interview on “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with Tom Keene. “If the guidance doesn’t move
up, if the revenue’s missed, really what you’re discounting in
terms of the growth outlook is not all that great.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
