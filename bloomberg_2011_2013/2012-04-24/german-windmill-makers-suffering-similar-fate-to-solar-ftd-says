German windmill makers such as
N ordex SE  are suffering a similar fate to solar companies as
Chinese firms push into the market,  Financial Times Deutschland
said , citing Manfred Bayerlein, chief executive officer of wind
power certification company TUEV Rheinland.  While  China â€™s technology is a few years behind, their
products are already economical, Bayerlein said, according to
the German newspaper. Chinese companies entering the market has
contributed to a 25 percent drop in prices since 2008, FTD said.  German solar companies such as  Solon SE (SOO1) ,  Solar Millennium
AG (S2M)  and  Q-Cells SE (QCE)  have filed for insolvency, while China has
built up an industry with more than 400 companies, some of which
are market leaders, FTD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
