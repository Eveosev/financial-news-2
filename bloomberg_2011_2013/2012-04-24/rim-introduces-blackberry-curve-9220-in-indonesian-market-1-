Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) ,
considering strategy changes after customer and market-share
losses, introduced a new smartphone BlackBerry Curve 9220 in
Indonesia as local demand for its products increased.  “We spent a lot of time in focus here making sure that our
product is as relevant as possible for Indonesians,” Hastings
Singh, RIM’s managing director for  South Asia , said on the
sidelines after a press conference in Jakarta today.  The new family of Curve phones will be available in
 Southeast Asia ’s largest economy from tomorrow priced at 2
million rupiah ($217), Waterloo, Ontario-based RIM said. They
feature a BlackBerry Messenger key and built-in FM radio.  RIM is set to face intensifying competition in emerging
markets as low-cost Chinese manufacturers like Huawei
Technologies Co. and  ZTE Corp. (000063) , which make handsets running
Google Inc.’s Android software, concentrate on Africa and Asia.  Indonesia is one of the RIM’s key growth areas because the
demand is growing. “We love the market here, it’s something we
are going to be focusing through 2012,” Singh said.  RIM plans to open about 4,000 outlets across Indonesia by
the end of February 2013, including dedicated BlackBerry stores,
store-in-stores and kiosks, a “proving ground” for an
expansion across Southeast Asia, the BlackBerry maker said in
Feb. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
