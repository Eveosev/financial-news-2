Sugar cane-growing areas in  Brazil ,
the world’s largest producer, will get rains this week,
preventing the start of the new crop’s harvest, according to
weather forecaster Somar Meteorologia.  Heavy rains will fall in the states of Parana and  Sao Paulo 
from tomorrow to April 27, Marco Antonio dos Santos, an
agronomist at the company in Sao Paulo, wrote in a report e-
mailed yesterday. Rainfall may exceed 50 millimeters (2 inches)
and will help soil moisture and plants, he said.  Wet weather over the weekend favored the development of
recently planted sugar cane, according to the report. New crops
were already smaller in size and inferior in quality because of
dry weather earlier this year, dos Santos said.  The crop in Brazil’s center south, the country’s main
producing region, is likely to be 510 million to 520 million
tons in the 2012-13 season starting this month, dos Santos said.
Sugar cane production in the region totaled 493.3 million tons
in 2011-12, the first drop in a decade, after dry weather, frost
and flowering reduced yields, according to industry group Unica.  The chance of frost in growing regions this year is “a lot
smaller” than in the previous two, dos Santos said. That is
because the Atlantic Ocean’s water temperatures near the region
are higher than normal, which helps prevent frost, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
