Sonda SA (SONDA) , Chile’s largest
information technology company, gained the most in a week after
first-quarter earnings before items beat analysts’ estimates.  Sonda climbed 0.6 percent to 1,419 pesos in Santiago, the
biggest increase since April 13. The benchmark Ipsa index
advanced 0.3 percent.  The company controlled by Chairman Andres Navarro reported
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of
26.3 billion pesos ($54 million), a 24 percent jump from the
same three months last year, according to data posted on the
securities regulator’s website after the close of trading
yesterday. The average estimate of three analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for 25.7 billion pesos.  “The results reinforce our positive view of the company,
sustained by its operational performance and attractive growth
through acquisitions,” Banco de  Chile  analysts wrote in a note
to clients today. “We expect a positive stock price reaction.”  Sales rose 21 percent to 154 billion pesos, while net
income rose 2.1 percent to 12.2 billion pesos, according to the
filing.  Sonda, with operations in 10 Latin American countries,
announced its fifth acquisition in  Brazil  last month, agreeing
to pay $55 million for 100 percent of PARS. The company has made
10 acquisitions since going public in 2006, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Sonda announced in 2010 plans to invest
$500 million through this year for regional expansion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
