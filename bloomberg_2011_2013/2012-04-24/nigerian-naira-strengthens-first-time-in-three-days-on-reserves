The naira strengthened the first
time in three days against the dollar on bets the central bank
will keep the local currency stable after foreign-exchange
reserves increased.  The currency of sub-Saharan  Africa ’s second biggest economy
appreciated 0.2 percent to 157.05 per dollar as of 1:24 p.m. in
Lagos, the commercial capital. The naira has appreciated 3.3
percent against the dollar this year.  Foreign-exchange reserves in Africa’s biggest oil producer
rose to 36.22 billion as at April 20, the  Central Bank of
Nigeria  published in its website today. The reserves have jumped
10 percent this year, according to data compiled by the bank.
Oil has traded more than $40 per barrel above the $72 benchmark
contained in the 2012 budget.  “The market might be reassured by the government” that
the various components of the reserves are “presently in
accumulation mode,” Gregory Kronsten, the London-based head of
macroeconomic research at FBN Capital Ltd., wrote in an e-mailed
note to clients today. “Official reserves, which include the
Excess Crude Account, are equivalent to 4.7 months of import
cover for goods and services at 2011 levels according to our
estimates.”  The central bank kept its benchmark  interest rate  unchanged
at a record high of 12 percent for a third meeting on March 20.
The  inflation  rate declined to 11.9 percent in February from
12.6 percent a month earlier, according to the  National Bureau
of Statistics .  The yield on  Nigeria ’s domestic bonds due 2015 rose six
basis points to 15.20 percent, according to the April 23 data on
the Financial Markets Dealers Association  website .  Ghana ’s cedi depreciated 1.2 percent to 1.8525 per dollar
in Accra, the weakest since at least June 1993.  To contact the reporter on this story:
