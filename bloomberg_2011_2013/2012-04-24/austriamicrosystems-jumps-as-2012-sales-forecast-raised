Austriamicrosystems AG (AMS)  rose to the
highest price in more than four years in Zurich after the
Austrian chipmaker raised its sales forecast a second time this
year as consumers buy more smartphones and tablet computers.  The stock gained as much as 11 percent to 68.75 Swiss
francs, the highest intraday level since Aug. 10, 2007, and was
trading up 8.2 percent as of 11:16 a.m. The stock has jumped 75
percent this year, valuing the company at 927 million francs
($1.02 billion).  Austriamicrosystems expects 2012 sales to increase more
than 30 percent, the Unterpremstaetten-based manufacturer said
in a  statement  late yesterday. First-quarter net income more
than doubled to 19.2 million euros ($25 million) from 7.4
million euros a year earlier, while sales rose 64 percent to
90.7 million euros. The company increased the revenue forecast
previously on Feb. 29, when it predicted full-year growth
exceeding 25 percent.  “We see attractive growth potential,”  Michael Foeth , an
analyst at Bank Vontobel, wrote in a note to investors, adding
that Austriamicrosystems’ profit was 60 percent higher than his
estimate. He has a buy  recommendation  on the stock. “All lights
on green.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
