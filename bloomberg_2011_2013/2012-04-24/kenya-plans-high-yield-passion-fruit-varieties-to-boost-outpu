Kenya introduced two high-yielding
passion fruit varieties that may boost production of the crop by
as much as 49 percent, said Solomon Kaniaru, an official at
Allfruits EPZ Ltd.  The Brazil and KP14 varieties are being distributed by the
Kenya Agricultural Research Institute and will be planted by
farmers this season, Kaniaru said in an interview yesterday in
Kwale, near the port city of  Mombasa . The crop is processed and
mainly exported to  Europe , he said.  Kenyan production of the fruit currently stands at 8,200
metric tons a year and the crop generates 154 million shillings
($1.9 million) at the farm gate, according to Kaniaru. About
45,000 seedlings will be distributed and may boost output by as
much as 4,000 tons a year, he said.  Allfruits is a unit of Frigoken Ltd., the Nairobi-based
company that produces processed fruits and vegetables.  To contact the reporter on this story:
