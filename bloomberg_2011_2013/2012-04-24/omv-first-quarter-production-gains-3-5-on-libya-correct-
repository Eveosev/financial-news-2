OMV AG (OMV) ’s first-quarter oil and gas
production grew by 3.5 percent on increased output in  Libya .  OMV produced 299,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day from
289,000 in the previous three months, while its refining margin
rose to $1.92 a barrel from $1.77, it said today in a statement.  Output in Libya, where operations resumed in November
following a nine-month hiatus after contributing about 10
percent of 2010 volumes, averaged 25,000 barrels a day in the
first quarter, OMV said. Average production was 7,100 barrels
last year in the country, compared with 32,800 barrels in 2010.  Libya, with  Africa ’s largest crude reserves, is expanding
output after operations were halted during an armed rebellion to
oust former leader  Muammar Qaddafi . The country is currently
pumping about 1.5 million barrels of crude a day.  Oil hedges crimped first-quarter earnings before interest
and taxes by 64 million euros ($84 million), OMV said.  Exploration costs of 130 million euros also exceeded the
prior quarter after the write-off of the unsuccessful Peking
Duck well in Norway and Aberlour well in the U.K., it said. The
company is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings on May 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
