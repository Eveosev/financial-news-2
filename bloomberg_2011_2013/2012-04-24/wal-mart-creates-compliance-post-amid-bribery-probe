Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , the world’s
largest retailer, created a new position to monitor global
compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as it
investigates allegations of a bribery scandal in Mexico.  The officer will be based in the retailer’s headquarters in
Bentonville, Arkansas, the company said today in a statement.
That executive will oversee compliance directors in five global
markets, including Mexico, the company said.  Wal-Mart is investigating allegations, raised by an April
21  New York  Times story, that executives in Mexico paid more
than $24 million in bribes to speed the retailer’s expansion
there. The company also is the subject of a U.S. Justice
Department criminal investigation, a person familiar with the
probe said yesterday.  The audit committee of Wal-Mart’s board, which is made up
entirely of independent directors, began investigating the
allegations six months ago, before the article was published,
and has hired legal advisers and forensic accountants to help,
Wal-Mart said.  The company also is reviewing FCPA compliance and related
policies and procedures in every country where it operates,
 David Tovar , a company spokesman, said in the statement. The
company started that probe in March 2011 at the behest of Chief
Executive Officer  Mike Duke , Wal-Mart said.  “We are taking a deep look at our policies and procedures
in every country in which we operate,” Tovar said.  Wal-Mart fell 2.1 percent to $58.31 at 1:55 p.m. in New
York. The shares had declined 0.4 percent this year before
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
