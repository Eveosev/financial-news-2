Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4) ,
Brazil’s second-largest airline by market value, rose the most
in a week after a newspaper report said it is negotiating the
sale of an additional stake to  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)   Shares  rose  4 percent to 10.17 reais at the close in Sao
Paulo, the biggest gain since April 17. Brazil’s benchmark index
Bovespa rose 0.7 percent. Delta climbed 0.9 percent to $10.48 in
 New York .  Folha de S.Paulo reported today that Gol is negotiating the
sale of an additional 17 percent stake to Delta, which already
owns 3 percent of the carrier. The newspaper cited unnamed
sources close to Gol and Delta. Gol denied it is in talks to
sell an additional stake to the Atlanta-based carrier. Delta
spokeswoman Sarah Lora declined to comment.  “Today’s Folha story brings back to mind last December’s
deal,” said Barclays Plc analyst Daniel Spilberg in a telephone
interview from  Sao Paulo . “If the report turns out to be true,
it could really be very good for the stock.”  Delta agreed to buy 3 percent of Gol on Dec. 7 for $100
million. When the deal was announced,  Richard Anderson , Delta’s
chief executive officer, said Gol shares were “significantly
undervalued.” Gol rallied 3.6 percent to 15.50 reais that day.  Tam SA, Brazil’s largest airline, fell 0.5 percent to 45.80
reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
