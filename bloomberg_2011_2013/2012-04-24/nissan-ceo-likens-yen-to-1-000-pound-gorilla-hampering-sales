Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  said sales at
Japan’s second-biggest automaker may reach 10 trillion yen
($123 billion) this year depending on the strength of a
currency Chief Executive Officer  Carlos Ghosn  compared with an
over-sized ape.  “There is a one-thousand-pound gorilla that’s
unpredictable, which is going to be the level of the yen,”
Ghosn said in an interview at the Beijing auto show yesterday.
“All the Japanese car manufacturers are suffering from it, but
for the rest of it, business is going very well.”  Nissan,  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and  Honda Motor Co. (7267)  will report
higher earnings this fiscal year, according to analysts’
estimates, as they restore production hobbled by natural
disasters in Japan and  Thailand  during 2011. While the yen has
weakened the most in a basket of 10 developed-nation currencies
this year, it’s still about 40 percent  stronger  than in the
months before Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s 2008 bankruptcy.  According to the Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency
Indexes, the yen is at a level of 399 today, compared with 285
in June 2008. The gauges track 10 developed-nation currencies,
and the yen is down 8 percent this year, the worst performer.  “Nissan is still in the process of expanding production
in the U.S. and building a structure that can offset the
effects of the strong yen,” Koichi Sugimoto, a Tokyo-based
auto analyst at BNP Paribas SA said today. “Some of Nissan’s
popular models in the U.S. are still made in  Japan , and against
the dollar, the carmaker still needs to build up resistance.”  Nissan fell 0.6 percent to 831 yen at the close of trading
in Tokyo. The stock has climbed 20 percent this year, compared
with a 12 percent advance for the benchmark  Nikkei 225 Stock
Average. (NKY)   Nissan’s revenue may increase 6.9 percent to 10.03
trillion yen in the year ending March 2013, according to the
average of 27 analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The
last time Nissan’s sales reached 10 trillion yen was in the
2008 financial year.  China Sales  Ghosn, who’s also CEO of Nissan’s biggest shareholder
 Renault SA (RNO) , forecast the Yokohama-based company’s sales to
continue to outperform in  China , where industry growth may
range from 5 percent to 6 percent this year.  In China, Nissan plans to become one of the top three
automakers in the country, helped by models such as those
introduced under the Venucia brand, which is geared toward
Chinese consumers looking for affordable cars, Ghosn said. The
automaker plans to introduce about 30 models in the country by
2015, including electric cars, and to almost double its
deliveries to more than 2.3 million units.  Ghosn reiterated his targets for Nissan’s Infiniti brand
to account for 10 percent of the global luxury-car market,
compared with about 2.5 percent to 3 percent today.  Nissan Executive Vice President Andy Palmer, who heads the
Infiniti business, yesterday said sales of the luxury brand in
China may reach 100,000 units by the end of March 2017, or 20
percent of its global deliveries.  Nissan plans to begin producing two Infiniti models in
China in 2014, Palmer said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
