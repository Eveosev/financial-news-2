Nordgold NV (NORD) , Russian billionaire
 Alexey Mordashov ’s gold producer, said first-quarter sales rose
8 percent as prices gained, compensating for a declining output.  Revenue climbed to $264 million from $244 million a year
earlier, the company, which was spun off from steelmaker OAO
Severstal earlier this year, said today in a regulatory filing.  Output fell 11 percent to 155,700 troy ounces from 174,200
ounces in the same period a year earlier, according to the
statement. Nordgold’s sales volumes fell 10 percent to 156,200
troy ounces of the precious metal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
