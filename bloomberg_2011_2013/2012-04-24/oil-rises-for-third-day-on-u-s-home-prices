Oil rose in  New York  after  home
prices  in 20 U.S. cities dropped at a slower pace in February,
bolstering optimism that economic expansion will accelerate in
the world’s biggest crude-consuming country.  Futures climbed 0.4 percent after the S&P/Case-Shiller
index of property values fell 3.5 percent from a year earlier,
the smallest 12-month drop since February 2011. Crude also
climbed as equities rose on better-than-estimated earnings. An
Energy Department report tomorrow may show that supplies rose
2.8 million barrels, according to a Bloomberg survey.  “We are following all the economic headlines for signs of
demand,” said  Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy &
Economic Research in Winchester, Massachusetts. “There was a
bounce in the stock market, which seemed to give oil a boost.”  Crude oil for June delivery advanced 44 cents to settle at
$103.55 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices are
up 4.8 percent this year.  Prices rose after the  American Petroleum Institute  said
U.S. oil supplies fell 985,000 barrels to 368.4 million last
week. Oil gained 61 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $103.72 a barrel
in electronic trading at 4:32 p.m.  Brent oil for June settlement declined 55 cents, or 0.5
percent, to end the session at $118.16 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The European benchmark
contract was at a premium of $14.61 to New York futures, down
from $15.60 yesterday. The spread between the contracts surged
to a record $27.88 on Oct. 14.  The S&P/Case-Shiller index climbed from the prior month on
a seasonally adjusted basis. A separate report showed that sales
of  new U.S. homes  were stronger than projected in March.  Home Sales  Purchases ran at a 328,000 annual rate, a decline of 7.1
percent from a revised 353,000 pace in February that was faster
than first projected, figures from the Commerce Department
showed today in  Washington . Economists forecast a March rate of
319,000, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  “The housing numbers aren’t great but they have
improved,” said Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at
Confluence Investment Management in  St. Louis .  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.4 percent. The euro
strengthened 0.2 percent versus the dollar. A stronger common
currency increases the appeal of raw materials as an investment.  “Stocks and the euro are higher,” said  Addison Armstrong ,
director of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford,
 Connecticut . “The market wasn’t able to gain momentum above
$104. We’ll have to see if the latest batch of U.S. economic
numbers is enough to move us higher.”  Oil Supplies  U.S. crude stockpiles are forecast to climb to the highest
level since May, according to the median of 11 analyst responses
in a Bloomberg survey.  Gasoline supplies  probably dropped 1.5
million barrels last week, the survey showed. Distillate-fuel
inventories, a category that includes heating oil and diesel,
gained an estimated 500,000 barrels.  “The DOE report tomorrow is expected to show another
supply increase, which will be bearish,” said  Tim Evans , an
energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York.  The government requires that reports be filed with the
Energy Department for its weekly survey. The API collects
information on a voluntary basis from operators of refineries,
bulk terminals and pipelines.  The  Federal Reserve  began a two-day meeting today on
monetary policy. Policy makers tomorrow will probably repeat
their plan to keep the benchmark  interest rate  low at least
through late 2014, economists say.  Fed Meeting  “You’re seeing positions taken before tomorrow’s Fed
announcement, even though members have indicated that nothing
will change,” said Jason Schenker, president of Prestige
Economics LLC, an Austin, Texas-based energy consultant.
“Tomorrow could be very volatile because of the releases.”  There is consensus that long-term crude prices will average
about $90 to $95 a barrel, Daniel Jaeggi, Mercuria Energy
Trading SA’s head of trading said at the Financial Times Global
Commodities Summit in Lausanne,  Switzerland , today.  Glencore
International Plc (GLEN) ’s head of oil, Alex Beard, said at the same
conference that $95 is a sustainable long-term price.  Electronic crude trading volume of on the Nymex was 337,479
contracts as of 4:32 p.m. Volume totaled 373,287 contracts
yesterday, the lowest level since March 26 and 41 percent below
the three-month average. Open interest was 1.54 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
