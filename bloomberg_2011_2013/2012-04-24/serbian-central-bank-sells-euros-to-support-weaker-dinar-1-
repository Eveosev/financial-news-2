The Serbian central bank sold euros
today to support the dinar, curbing its decline past 112 to the
euro.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije said it sold 20
million euros ($26.4 million) to “enable the smooth
functioning” of the market. The National Bank of Serbia has
sold 608.5 million euros since the start of 2012 to prop up the
dinar.  The “dinar downside may have gained more traction from
political risks ahead of May 6 elections,” Zagreb-based Hypo
Alpe Adria Bank d.d. said in a note to clients today, adding
that repeated central bank efforts to curb the dinar’s weakness
may lead to an increase in the benchmark  interest rate  “by
50-75 basis points in the next three months” since foreign-
currency reserves “cannot be depleted forever.”  The bank left its  two-week repurchase rate  unchanged at 9.5
percent on April 12 and amended reserve-requirement rules,
releasing foreign-currency liquidity and draining dinars to
stabilize the Serbian currency and damp inflationary pressures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
