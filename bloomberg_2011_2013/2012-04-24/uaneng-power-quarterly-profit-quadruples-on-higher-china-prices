Huaneng Power International Inc. (902) ,
the publicly traded unit of China’s largest electricity
producer, said first-quarter profit quadrupled after higher
tariffs and gains in its  Singapore  business.  Net income  surged to 919.4 million yuan ($146 million), or
7 cents a share, in the three months ended March 31, from 226
million yuan, or 2 cents, a year earlier, the company said today
in a  statement  to the Shanghai stock exchange. Revenue increased
12 percent to 34.3 billion yuan.  The Chinese government, which controls electricity prices
to curb inflation, increased them for the first time in six
months on Dec. 1 to help utilities that have posted losses
because of rising fuel costs. Huaneng Power President Liu Guoyue
said in March his company was profitable in the first two months
of 2012 after the tariff increase.  “After the increase of on-grid tariffs in the first
quarter, the company’s deficit in power generation in mainland
 China  has decreased,” Huaneng Power said in the earnings
statement. “We took advantage of market opportunities in
Singapore and recorded increased profit in the market.”  Huaneng Power shares gained 6.8 percent this year in Hong
Kong trading, compared with a 12 percent increase in the
benchmark  Hang Seng Index . The stock rose 0.7 percent to HK$4.41
at the close, before the earnings announcement.  The company didn’t elaborate on earnings from specific
sectors.  First-quarter profit may increase more than 50 percent from
a year earlier, Huaneng said in a statement to the Hong Kong
stock exchange on April 19, citing higher tariffs as one of the
reasons.  Profit slumped 65 percent to 1.18 billion yuan in 2011 on
higher coal costs and capped prices, Huaneng said on March 20.  The company’s debt-to-asset  ratio  rose to 77.1 percent last
year from 72.8 percent in 2010, President Liu said in March. The
unit of state-owned China Huaneng Group Corp. is “actively”
seeking financial support from the Chinese government, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
