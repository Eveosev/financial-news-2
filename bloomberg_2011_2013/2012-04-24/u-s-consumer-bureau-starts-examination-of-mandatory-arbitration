The U.S. Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau is seeking comment on the use of clauses that
require consumers to resolve disputes with companies through
arbitration rather than through the court system.  “We want to learn how arbitration clauses affect
consumers, and how effective arbitration is in resolving
consumers’ issues,” CFPB Director  Richard Cordray  said today in
an e-mail statement announcing the request. “This inquiry will
help the Bureau assess whether rules are needed.” Comments are
due to the agency by June 23.  Mandatory arbitration clauses are used for products
including credit cards, checking accounts and payday loans.  The bureau didn’t say when it would complete its study,
which is required under the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the 2010 law,
the consumer bureau can ban or condition the use of mandatory
arbitration in financial-services contracts, consistent with the
results of the study.  To contact the reporter on this story:
