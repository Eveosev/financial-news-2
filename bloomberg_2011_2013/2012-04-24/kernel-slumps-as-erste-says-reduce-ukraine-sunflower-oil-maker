Kernel Holding SA (KER) , Ukraine’s
biggest sunflower-oil producer, fell to the lowest level in two
weeks after Erste Group Bank AG started coverage on the company
with a recommendation to reduce holdings in the stock.  The stock declined 3.2 percent to 70.75 zloty at 12:53 p.m.
in Warsaw, the lowest intraday level since April 10. The
Austrian bank set Kernel’s price estimate at 66.1 zloty.  “The global pricing environment has been favorable in
recent years for food companies, but a cooling off of the
segment is possible,” Erste wrote in a research note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
