Kenya ’s shilling headed for the
weakest level in almost two weeks after importers sought dollars
to make end-of-month payments.  The currency of East Africa’s largest economy depreciated
0.1 percent to 83.25 per dollar by 3:39 p.m. in Nairobi, the
capital, on course for the lowest close basis since April 12.  “It is typical month-end demand,” Nahashon Mungai, a
currency dealer with Equity Bank Ltd., said by phone from
Nairobi today. Kenyan oil importers and buyers of essential
items and  consumer goods  settle their orders in the last week
every month, he said.  The Tanzanian shilling weakened for the first time in four
trading sessions, losing 0.2 percent to 1,586 per dollar as
importers bought the U.S. currency.  Uganda ’s shilling appreciated as much as 0.4 percent and
traded 0.2 percent stronger at 2,513 per dollar.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
