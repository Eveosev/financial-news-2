Oil options volatility fell to the
lowest in more than a year as the underlying futures advanced 44
cents, staying within the trading range they’ve been in since
April 4.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 23.57 percent at 3:08 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , compared with 24.23 percent yesterday.
It was the fourth straight decline and lowest level since at
least March 4, 2011.  “It’s definitely off for today,” said Fred Rigolini, vice
president of Paramount Options Inc. in  New York .  “We’re still
in this tight range of about $100 to $105.”  Crude oil for June delivery rose 0.4 percent to settle at
$103.55 a barrel on Nymex. Crude has traded in a range of
$100.68 to $105.07 since April 4. Futures have declined 5.7
percent since reaching a high of $109.77 on Feb. 24.  The most-active oil options in electronic trading today
were October $68 puts, which lost 7 cents to 24 cents a barrel
at 3:14 p.m. with 2,451 contracts trading. June $100 puts were
the second-most active with 2,380 lots changing hands. They fell
21 cents to $1.20.  Puts accounted for 56 percent of electronic trading volume.
One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Bearish bets accounted for 57 percent of the 82,449 trades
