China ’s banks posted their fastest
profit growth in at least four years for 2011 as income from
loans and fee-based financial services outpaced an increase in
defaults triggered by a slowing economy.  Financial institutions in China including policy banks,
commercial lenders, rural credit cooperatives and foreign banks,
earned a combined net income of 1.25 trillion yuan ($198 billion)
last year, a gain of 39 percent from a year earlier, the China
Banking Regulatory Commission said in its  annual report  today.  Shares (1398)  of China’s eight largest commercial banks have
rallied an average 54 percent since a 2 1/2-year low in October
as concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis would deepen the economic
slowdown eased. The Asian nation’s efforts to bolster banks’
risk buffers and curb inflation have pushed up funding costs,
weakened the  property market  and spurred defaults.  China’s economy  expanded 9.2 percent last year after
growing 10.4 percent in 2010.  Chinese lenders advanced 7.47 trillion yuan of new loans
last year, 6 percent less than the amount offered in 2010. Banks
need to keep appropriate credit growth in 2012 and boost lending
to smaller enterprises and key infrastructure projects, the
regulator said today.  The nation’s financial institutions had 1.05 trillion yuan
of non-performing loans by the end of 2011, accounting for 1.8
percent of their total advances, according to the regulator.
Banks must step up efforts to fend off risks associated with
local government financing vehicles and the real estate sector
this year, it said.  Lending risks to China’s property developers are rising as
many have high leverage ratios and face a liquidity squeeze amid
falling home prices,  Liu Mingkang , former chairman of the
banking regulator, said last week.  --Luo Jun. Editors: Russell Ward, James Gunsalus  To contact Bloomberg News staff of this story:
