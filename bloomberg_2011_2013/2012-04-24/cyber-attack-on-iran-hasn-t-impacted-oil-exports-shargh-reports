A cyber attack that targeted  Iran ’s
oil ministry and affiliated state companies has not affected the
country’s crude exports,  Shargh  reported, citing unidentified
oil officials.  The computer systems of the National Iranian Oil Co.
weren’t damaged and exports of crude and oil derivatives have
not been affected, an official working in NIOC international
affairs department told the Tehran-based newspaper.  Though the central internet network has been interrupted
internal networks are functioning and there have been no
problems in operational sites, another official working with the
Iranian Offshore Oil Co. told the newspaper.  Iranian officials said yesterday that several of its main
Persian Gulf Oil terminals were disconnected from the internet
