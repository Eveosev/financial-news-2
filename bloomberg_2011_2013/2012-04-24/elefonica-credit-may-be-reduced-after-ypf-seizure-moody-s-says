(Corrects headline in story published April 24 to show that
Moody’s said  Argentina ’s takeover of YPF has negative
implications for Telefonica.)  Argentine’s decision to seize
 Repsol YPF SA (REP) ’s unit will have negative implications for
companies like  Telefonica SA (TEF)  with investments in the country,
according to Moody’s Investors Service.  Plans to nationalize YPF, Argentina’s biggest energy
company, will not only hurt Repsol but also have “negative
credit implications” on Telefonica,  Endesa SA (ELE) , Gas Natural SA
and  Obrascon Huarte Lain SA (OHL) , according to an e-mailed report.
Argentine companies in the energy sector may also be affected as
they “face a higher risk of further government interference in
the oil and gas sector.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
