     April 24 (Bloomberg) -- Treasuries fell after the U.S. sold
$35 billion in two-year securities in the first of three note
auctions this week totaling $99 billion.  The notes drew a yield of 0.270 percent, compared with a
forecast of 0.278 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of nine of
the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers. The bid-to-cover
ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids with the
amount of securities offered, was 3.76, highest since September,
compared with an average of 3.56 for the past 10 sales. The Fed
started a two-day meeting, with Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
scheduled to hold a press conference tomorrow.  “Two-year auctions have come and gone with no problems as
the Fed is still on hold and there remains a risk-averse bid in
the market,” said Justin Lederer, an interest-rate strategist
in New York at Cantor Fitzgerald LP, one of 21 primary dealers
required bid at the auctions. “Unless something changes at the
Fed or in the global economy, then expect to continue seeing
well-bid two-year note auctions.”  The  yield  on the current two-year note rose one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 0.27 percent, at 1:11 p.m.
in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The
 yield  on the benchmark 10-year note rose two basis points to
1.96 percent.  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 32.1 percent of the notes, compared
with an average of 32.4 percent for the past 10 sales.  Two More Auctions  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 7.8 percent of
the notes at the sale, the lowest since February 2011, compared
with an average of 13.5 percent for the past 10 auctions.  The two-year notes being sold today yielded 0.275 percent
in pre-auction trading. The Treasury is due to auction $35
billion of five-year securities tomorrow and $29 billion of
seven-year debt on April 26.  Two-year notes have gained 0.1 percent this year, compared
with a 0.2 percent gain for Treasuries overall, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
