Mitt Romney  promotes himself as a
chief executive fit for the White House. He has now begun the
process of making his most consequential management decision
yet: choosing a vice president.  Romney’s search for a running mate is officially under way.
His campaign appearance yesterday with Florida Senator Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American whose popularity with Republican voters
and Hispanics has earned him a top spot on the list of
prospective picks, only drew attention to a process that is as
secretive as it is closely watched.  What is known is that Romney -- who was vetted for the No.
2 spot in 2008 by the campaign of the party’s nominee, Arizona
Senator  John McCain  -- has named longtime aide Beth Myers to
head the process, tapping a trusted adviser whose experience
assisting the former Massachusetts governor four years ago will
inform her effort this time.  “Beth Myers has begun to put together a number of the
names and criteria and so forth that would be associated with
that process,” Romney told reporters in a joint question-and-
answer session with Rubio yesterday outside Philadelphia. “But
we really haven’t had a discussion yet of putting together a
list or evaluating various candidates.”  Romney said he and Myers have begun looking for the people
-- including those well-versed in examining financial records --
who will help scrub potential candidates’ backgrounds for any
impropriety, political liability or other problems.  ‘Very Early Stages’  “We’re looking at various people, resources to help with
that process, accounting staff and so forth, to take a look at
tax returns and things of that nature,” Romney said. “It’s
just at the very early stages.”  Vice presidential nominees typically make their debut at
the party’s national convention, giving Romney months to make a
decision before it gets under way on Aug. 27. He is expected to
cement his front-runner status in primaries today in
 Connecticut ,  Delaware ,  New York , Pennsylvania and  Rhode Island .  Among the many unknowns is what Romney will try to achieve
with his selection.  The choice typically mixes intangible factors, including
personal rapport and personality type with straightforward
political considerations, such as appeal in a competitive state
or with a certain element of the party base.  “There’s a well-developed set of criteria, and no one
person ever scores a 10 on each criteria; so then it becomes a
judgment call made by the candidate and his team,” said Whit Ayres, a Republican polling specialist with Virginia-based North
Star Opinion Research.  Personal Chemistry  “Personal comfort with the nominee is a very important
criterion -- comfort and chemistry,” Ayres said. “And then the
political criteria of ’Can someone bring a state that Romney
might not otherwise get,’ or ’Can you generate excitement for
the ticket because you are trusted among a part of the coalition
that doesn’t particularly trust him.’”  Romney’s advisers wouldn’t speak publicly about the
selection process, and the campaign declined through spokeswoman
Andrea Saul to comment. Still, some people close to the
candidate say privately that they expect to see his disciplined,
data-driven decision-making approach prevail in his search for a
running mate.  In particular, they said he probably won’t seek to shake up
the race by choosing a little-known candidate, as McCain did
when he tapped then-first-term Alaska Governor Sarah Palin.
While the choice delighted anti-tax, small-government
Republicans with whom McCain needed to improve his standing, it
was widely seen as alienating potential swing voters.  Running Mate Qualifications  The qualification set of a running mate “is something that
we’re going to be considering down the road as we consider
various potential vice presidential nominees,” Romney told
reporters.  With the party base split after a three-month primary,
attention also is being focused on Republicans who might earn
Romney better standing with voters motivated by their opposition
to abortion rights and same-sex marriage as well as the party’s
anti-tax  Tea Party  faction.  “It has to be a concern, and if the idea is generate
excitement among the most conservative elements of the party,
there are lots of superstars,” Ayres said, naming Rubio, former
Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Louisiana Governor  Bobby Jindal  as
examples.  Ohio Senator  Rob Portman , House Budget Committee Chairman
 Paul Ryan  of  Wisconsin  and Virginia Governor  Bob McDonnell  --who
have all appeared with Romney and campaigned on his behalf --
are also regarded as strong prospects.  Best-Known, Best-Liked  And New Jersey Governor  Chris Christie , the best-known and
best-liked of Romney’s potential running mates, according to an
April 19 Quinnipiac University national poll, is frequently
mentioned as a finalist.  If there is one thing all Romney’s possible running mates
have in common, it’s their determination not to comment on their
chances or the selection process.  Rubio will no longer even entertain questions about it.  “I’m not talking about that process anymore,” he told
reporters in  Pennsylvania  yesterday.  Pressed in an April 20 interview with the Washington Post,
Portman said of being chosen for the vice presidency: “It isn’t
my objective.”  It’s not Christie’s either, he told reporters on April 17.
Still, he added that it would be “extraordinarily arrogant” of
him not to listen to Romney if he were to ask him to join the
Republican ticket. If “Mitt Romney calls and wants to discuss
it with me, I will sit down and talk with  Governor Romney  about
it.”  Romney should have no shortage of others offering their
thoughts on the matter. “Everybody’s an expert at this,” Ayres
said. “The campaign, the nominee and his advisers will get
inundated with unsolicited advice.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
