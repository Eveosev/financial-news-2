Extra immigration staff will be
deployed at  London ’s Heathrow airport to prevent delays to
athletes and sports fans arriving for the  Olympic Games , U.K.
Home Secretary Theresa May said.  “We will be at peak times manning all of the desks” at
passport control, May told the House of Commons Home Affairs
Committee in London today. “Those plans are in place.”  May told lawmakers that contingency plans had also been
drawn up to bring in extra staff if necessary to help with
immigration checks. She said the U.K. Border Force had been able
to cope with extra numbers during the Easter break. In any case,
May said, not everyone would be arriving in London for the games
on the same day. The event runs from July 27 to Aug. 12.  London’s Evening Standard newspaper reported that lengthy
lines built up yesterday at passport control at Heathrow’s
Terminal 5, holding up teams returning from the Bahrain Formula
One Grand Prix as well as Canadian singer Justin Bieber. The
Immigration Services Union, which represents border officials,
called for more than 300 frontier staff to be recruited, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
