deficit of 13.8 billion pounds ($21.8 billion) in April, the
first month of the fiscal year.  The figure, which excludes support for banks, compared with
9.1 billion pounds a year earlier, the  Office for National
Statistics  said in  London  today. Revenue rose 1.3 percent in
April from a year earlier and spending increased 3.8 percent.  The public finances received a one-time boost of 30.3

pension assets to the public sector and the impact of the
central bankâ€™s Special Liquidity Scheme. This left a budget
surplus of 16.5 billion pounds last month.  Prime Minister  David Cameron  has said there can be no

domestic as the deepening euro-region crisis intensifies
pressure for a relaxation of his austerity policies.  A cash-based measure of the government finances showed a
surplus of 23.2 billion pounds in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
