ABB Ltd. (ABBN)  expects no delays or one-
time charges at its off-shore wind park projects,  Financial
Times Deutschland  said, citing an interview with Peter Terwiesch, head of the Swiss company’s German operations.  Profit margins for the projects are in a “normal
development corridor,” Terwiesch said, according to the German
newspaper. ABB’s experience contrasts with that of  Siemens AG (SIE) ,
which is expected to book more charges for its wind parks.  ABB’s first platform called Borwin 1 is already operating
and is awaiting the final handoff and the company is now working
on platforms called Dolwin and Dolwin 2, FTD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
