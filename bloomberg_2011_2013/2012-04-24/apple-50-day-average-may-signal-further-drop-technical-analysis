Apple Inc. (AAPL)  dipped below its 50-day
average yesterday for the first time since December. A weekly
close below that level may signal a decline of as much as 19
percent from its record high is under way, according to UBS AG.  Shares of the Cupertino, California-based company dropped
in nine out of the 10 past days, sinking 10 percent after
reaching an all-time high of $636.23 on April 9. The stock
yesterday briefly sank below its 50-day average of $570.76
before recovering some losses to close at $571.70.  Should Apple fail to hold above its 50-day average, it may
trigger a retreat to as low as $515, according to Peter Lee, the
New York-based chief technical analyst for UBS.  “Violation of this level on a weekly closing basis opens
the door for a deeper correction,” Lee wrote in an e-mail
yesterday. “To convince traders to return, AAPL needs to
rally” above $600 at least, he said, referring to the stock’s
ticker.  Apple retreated from the best quarterly gain since 2004
amid speculation that the iPhone maker won’t be able to keep
growing at the pace that made it the world’s most valuable
company. The stock rallied 48 percent from January through March
as fourth-quarter earnings beat the  average analyst estimate  by
the most since 2009. The company may say later today that net
income rose to $9.96 a share, according to the average analyst
forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  The stock has stayed above its 50-day average for 85 days
since Dec. 20, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The last time
Apple ended a longer streak above 50-day average, during the 132
days through March 14, 2011, it spent the following nine months
oscillating around the 50-day gauge before rallying to a record.  “Once the current downside action gets worked out, I want
to see a similar pattern,” Arthur Huprich, an analyst with
Raymond James & Associates Inc., wrote in a note yesterday.
Given “its poster boy image for growth and leadership, the
earnings report could make the ‘tape’ very interesting.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
