Members of the Joint Peninsula
Shield, a Gulf military alliance that helped Bahrain crack down
on protesters last year, will hold a training exercise later
this month, the state-run Bahrain News Agency said.  The 29-30 April drill will “test the extent of harmony and
liaison among the land, air and naval contingents” of the
forces and their capability to implement special operations, BNA
reported today. It did not specify where the maneuvers would
take place.  Last year, a force drawn from the six-member Gulf
Cooperation Council was dispatched to Bahrain to help quell a
month of mass protests by mostly Shiite demonstrators demanding
equal rights and representation from the Sunni monarchy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
