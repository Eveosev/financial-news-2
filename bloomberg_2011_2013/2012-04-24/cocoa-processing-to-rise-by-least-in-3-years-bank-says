Global cocoa bean processing this
season will rise by 2.4 percent, the smallest gain in three
years, according to Macquarie Group Ltd.  Bean grindings, an indication of demand, will reach 4
million metric tons in the 2011-12 marketing year started in
October, the bank estimated in a report e-mailed today. Cocoa
processing fell 6 percent in 2008-09 as global economies entered
the worst recession since World War II, the bank said.  “At a time when the global economy is still struggling to
recover to pre-2008 levels, especially in the major consumption
hubs of  Europe  and  North America , such a modest consumption
growth should not come as a surprise,”  Kona Haque , an analyst
at the bank in London, wrote in the report.  Cocoa processing in Europe will see “minimal growth” from
last season, she said. Grindings in the EU will total 1.499
million tons in 2011-12, up from 1.479 million tons in 2010-11,
data from the bank show. Processing in the U.S. is forecast at
415,000 tons in 2011-12, up from 397,000 tons last season,
according to the data.  “The rise in global grindings we expect this season is
mainly due to expansion in origin, of which Ivory Coast will
rise the most,” Haque said. Producing countries account for 43
percent of global grindings, up from 30 percent in the 1990s,
she said.  Ivory Coast  is the world’s biggest cocoa grower.  Bean processing will rise 3 percent to 4.1 million tons in
the 2012-13 season that starts in October, “as the economic
outlook improves,” according to the report.  Cocoa Butter  Sales of cocoa butter, which accounts for as much as 20
percent of a chocolate bar, will remain stronger than those of
cocoa powder, used in cookies and ice-cream, Haque said. Demand
for cocoa powder is being driven by  emerging markets , she said,
adding that powder price gains have begun to stall.  “This could suggest that grinders are well covered and
thus orders have been easing, or that supply availability has
improved in response to the attractive prices over preceding
months,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
