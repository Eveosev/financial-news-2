Dairibord Holdings Zimbabwe Ltd.
sold its 40 percent stake in Charhons (Pvt) Ltd. to Cairns

Executive Officer Anthony Mandiwanza.  The Zimbabwean candy and chocolate maker was sold for $1
million, the Harare-based newspaper said on its website.  Dairibord, the southern African nation’s biggest dairy-

it owns in Malawi, it said.  The dairy producer said revenue rose 19 percent to $24
million in the first quarter through March 31 this year, while
production rose 13 percent to 16.2 million liters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
