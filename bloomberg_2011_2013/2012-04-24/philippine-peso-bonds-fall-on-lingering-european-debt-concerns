Philippine bonds and the peso fell
as mounting concern that Europe will fail to implement budget
cuts aimed at ending a sovereign-debt crisis weakened demand for
emerging-market assets.  The  MSCI Asia-Pacific (MXAP)  Index of stocks dropped for a fourth
day after Dutch Prime Minister  Mark Rutte  resigned in a bid to
break a deadlock over additional budget cuts needed to satisfy
European deficit limits. The Philippines’ Bureau of Internal
Revenue missed its tax collection goal in March, the government
said on its Twitter account yesterday.  “People are more defensive,” said Antonio Espedido,
treasurer at  China Banking Corp. (CHIB)  in Manila. “It looks like the
implementation of austerity measures in Europe will be rocky
because of protests and that is worrisome.”  The peso slipped 0.1 percent to 42.695 per dollar in
Manila, prices from Tullett Prebon Plc show. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, was unchanged at 5.1 percent.  The yield on 5 percent government bonds due August 2018
climbed five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 5
percent, according to Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
