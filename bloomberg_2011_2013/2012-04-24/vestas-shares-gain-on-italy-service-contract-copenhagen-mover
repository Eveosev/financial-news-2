Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  was the
biggest winner on Copenhagen’s benchmark index today after the
world’s largest wind turbine maker won a 15-year service
contract in  Italy .  Vestas rose as much as 3.1 percent, today’s biggest jump in
the Copenhagen 20 Index. The  stock  advanced 1.5 kroner, or 2.9
percent, to 52.85 kroner at 10:40 a.m. in the Danish capital.
The shares of the Aarhus, Denmark-based company lost 5 percent
yesterday.  Vestas said today it will provide maintenance for 10
Italian wind parks owned by ERG Renew SpA in an order that
includes 126 turbines. Vestas said Feb. 8 that its service
business is now more profitable than the division that sells
 wind turbines , and that it will be its fastest growing business
going forward.  To contact the reporter on this story:
