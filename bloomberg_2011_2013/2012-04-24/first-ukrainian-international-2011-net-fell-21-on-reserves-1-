First Ukrainian International
Bank’s profit last year fell 20.8 percent after it used more
cash to cover  reserve requirements .  Net income fell to $56 million from $71 million a year
earlier, Konstantin Vaisman, the bank’s chief executive officer,
told reporters in capital Kiev today. Pretax profit rose 13.6
percent to $76 million, he said.  “We would like profit to increase in 2012,” Vaisman said
adding that it will at least be on the level of 2011. The bank
expects to increase number of its clients from 1.5 million now
to more than 2 million in 2014, he said.  First Ukrainian International, also referred to as FUIB, is
owned by Ukraine’s richest man, Rinat Akhmetov, and is a part of
Akhmetov’s holding System Capital Management, which includes
also the country’s biggest steelmaker Metinvest, energy company
DTEK and other businesses.  Credit portfolio growth in 2012 is expected to be similar
to 2011, Vaisman said. Last year, FUIB’s credit portfolio rose
9.8 percent to $2.4 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
