Hidroelectrica SA , Romania’s state-
owned hydropower generator, will resume power supplies at full
capacity beginning next month, after river water levels
improved, according to an e-mailed statement today.  Hidroelectrica, which cut electricity supplies to about 50
percent during last year’s drought, said it will end a force-
majeure clause it activated for its contracts with companies
such as  Alro SA (ALR)  and will deliver power in “normal conditions”
starting on May 1, the company said in the statement.  Alro, a Romanian aluminum smelter majority owned by  Vimetco
NV (VICO) , said in January its production may be affected by the power
supplies shortage that forced the smelter to buy the rest from
the overnight market at higher costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
