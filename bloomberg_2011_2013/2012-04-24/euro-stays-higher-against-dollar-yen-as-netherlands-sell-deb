The euro strengthened against most
of its major counterparts after  Spain , Italy and the Netherlands
sold bonds, damping concern the region’s sovereign-debt crisis
is worsening.  Australia ’s dollar dropped after a government report showed
 consumer prices  rose at the slowest pace since 2009. Currencies
of most other commodities-exporting nations, led by South
Africa’s rand, gained versus the dollar as stocks and
commodities advanced following data that pointed to a
stabilizing U.S. housing market. Hungary’s forint climbed before
a decision tomorrow on whether bailout talks will proceed.  “You’re seeing a little bit of optimism,” said  Kathy Lien , director of currency research at the online trading firm
GFT Forex in New York. “We had those bond auctions from Italy
and Spain, so that’s helped relieve some of the stress on
peripheral yields, and that’s helping some of the higher-
yielding currencies rebound.”  The euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.3197 at 5 p.m. in  New York .
It gained 0.5 percent to 107.32 yen after dropping earlier as
much as 0.5 percent.  Japan ’s currency fell 0.2 percent to 81.32
per dollar.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  advanced as much as 0.6
percent before trimming the gain to 0.4 percent, and the Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials added 0.3 percent.  European Bonds  Spain’s bonds gained, pushing yields on  two-year notes  down
14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage point, to 3.43 percent after
the nation sold 1.9 billion euros ($2.5 billion) of bills. The
maximum target was 2 billion euros. Two-year Dutch note yields
fell the most in almost five months as the Netherlands sold
securities due in 2014 and 2037.  Italy ’s yields dropped after
the nation sold 2.5 billion euros of zero-coupon notes.  Dutch Prime Minister  Mark Rutte  told politicians to face up
to the country’s economic woes to ensure the Netherlands evades
 Europe ’s debt crisis, as opposition lawmakers said there was no
need to stick to budget targets. Rutte offered his cabinet’s
resignation to  Queen Beatrix  yesterday.  The euro extended gains versus the dollar after data showed
 home prices  in 20 U.S. cities dropped at a slower pace in the
year ended February. The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property
values fell 3.5 percent from a year earlier, the smallest 12-
month drop since February 2011. Sales of new U.S. homes in March
were stronger than forecast, Commerce Department data showed.  South Africa ’s rand gained 0.6 percent to 7.7967 per
dollar, and Canada’s dollar appreciated 0.4 percent to 98.71
cents to the greenback.  Two-Week Low  The Aussie dollar was little changed at $1.0315 after
falling earlier to $1.0247, the weakest since April 11.  Central-bank Governor  Glenn Stevens  signaled on April 3 he
may end a three-month pause in  interest-rate  cuts as soon as
next month if weaker-than-forecast growth slows inflation.  Hungary’s forint was the best-performing emerging-market
currency after Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  said the European
Commission and Hungary have moved “a lot closer” to proceeding
with rescue talks even as several issues are unresolved.  The commission will decide tomorrow whether to allow the
talks to proceed, Orban said. It has blocked  Hungary ’s request
for an International Monetary Fund loan on concern Orban’s
concentration of power in the past two years undermined the
independence of state institutions including the central bank.  The forint advanced 2 percent to 222.49 per dollar and
gained 1.7 percent against the euro to 293.61.  Sterling Climbs  Sterling reached a 20-month high against the euro and
touched the strongest in more than five months versus the dollar
before a report tomorrow that’s forecast by a Bloomberg survey
to show U.K. gross domestic product gained 0.1 percent. It
shrank 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter.  The pound rose 0.1 percent to 81.44 pence per euro, the
strongest level since August 2010, before trading at 81.74
pence, down 0.2 percent. The British currency gained 0.2 percent
to $1.6164, the highest since Oct. 31, before trading little
changed at $1.6144.  Japan’s currency has slid 8.3 percent this year, the worst
performer among the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation Weighted Indexes. The dollar has declined
2.4 percent, and the euro has weakened 0.5 percent.  The yen dropped versus most major peers today amid bets the
 Bank of Japan (8301)  will announce further monetary easing policies on
April 27. The central bank is “committed” to monetary easing,
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said last week in New York.  Dollar Advance  The dollar is poised to resume a bullish trend against the
yen and may rise to a one-year high as a corrective decline
ends, according to Bank of America Corp.  The U.S. currency has gained 1 percent since April 16, when
it fell to as low as 80.30 yen after a 4 percent drop since mid-
March. The dollar’s ability to rally off that low, a level just
above its pivot support range of 79.54 to 80.15 yen, indicates
it may gain to 84.82 or 85.45 yen,  MacNeil Curry , head of
foreign-exchange and interest-rates technical strategy at Bank
of America in New York, said in a telephone interview.  Support is a chart area where buy orders may be clustered.  The U.S. Federal Open Market Committee begins a two-day
meeting today and is scheduled to release a statement tomorrow
on monetary policy. All 79 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
estimated the Fed will keep its benchmark interest rate in a
range of zero to 0.25 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
