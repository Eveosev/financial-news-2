Ford Motor Co. (F) , the second-biggest
U.S. carmaker, will suspend production at its plant in Cologne,
 Germany , for as many as eight days before the summer break
starts in July because of falling sales in southern  Europe .  Ford will decide later on any additional days of production
stoppages through October, Ragah Kamel, a spokeswoman at the
U.S. company’s European headquarters in Cologne, said in a phone
interview today. The cutbacks affect 4,000 of the roughly 17,500
employees at the factory, she said. Summer vacation at the plant
is scheduled for July and August.  The  manufacturer  will apply for government assistance to
make up for the curtailed hours and will pay additional
compensation, Ford said in a statement. The plant, which makes
the Fiesta small car, is scheduled to build 345,000 vehicles
this year, roughly 6 percent fewer than in 2011, Kamel said.  More than 85 percent of the Cologne plant’s production
volume is exported and, “with an average utilization of 85
percent, the plant is still relatively busy,” she said. No
similar measures are planned at Ford’s other German
manufacturing site in Saarlouis, she said.  The cutback was reported late yesterday by Koelner Stadt-
Anzeiger, which said Ford planned as many as 16 days without
production from May through October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
