The dollar is poised to resume a
bullish trend against the yen and may rise to a one-year high as
a corrective decline ends, according to Bank of America Corp.  “We had this correction, which looks like it’s run its
course,”  MacNeil Curry , head of foreign-exchange and interest-
rates technical strategy at Bank of America in New York, said in
a telephone interview. “The way we’ve rallied off of those lows
is an impulsive move to the top side, which indicates the larger
bull trend is resuming.”  The dollar has gained 1 percent since April 16, when it
fell to as low as 80.30 yen after a 4 percent drop since Mid-
March. The dollar’s ability to rally off that low, a level just
above its pivot support range of 79.54 to 80.15 yen, indicates
it may gain further to 84.82 or 85.45 yen, Curry said.  Pivot refers to levels at which a currency or asset price
changes direction. Support is an area on a chart where buy
orders may be clustered.  The greenback was little changed at 81.22 yen at 2:45 p.m.
in  New York . It has gained 5.6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
