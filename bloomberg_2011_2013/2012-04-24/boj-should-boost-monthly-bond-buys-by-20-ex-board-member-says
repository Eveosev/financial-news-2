The  Bank of Japan (8301)  should bolster
its monthly purchases of  government bonds  by a fifth and double
its inflation target at its April 27 policy meeting, a former
board member said.  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa and his board should also commit
to pursuing monetary easing through 2014, mirroring the U.S.
Federal Reserve’s pledge to keep rates near zero, Nobuyuki Nakahara, who served on the BOJ board from 1998 to 2002, said in
a statement e-mailed to Bloomberg News today. The BOJ currently
buys 1.8 trillion yen ($22 billion) in government debt each
month.  Some ruling  Democratic Party  of  Japan  lawmakers have called
on the BOJ to do more to end  deflation  after it pledged to buy
more government debt and introduced a 1 percent inflation target
in February. Simply bolstering the size of the bank’s asset-
purchase fund, its main policy tool, won’t translate into
meaningful increases in monetary base or the central bank’s
balance sheet, Nakahara said.  “It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to call these monetary
measures a mere trick,” said Nakahara, 77, pointing out that
the central bank has failed to articulate how it plans to meet
its price goal or how its policies will bolster growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
