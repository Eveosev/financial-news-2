President  Barack Obama  said the
Secret Service is a professional operation focused on doing its
job right and “a couple of knuckleheads shouldn’t detract from
what they do.”  Six Secret Service employees have been forced out amid a
scandal over their involvement with prostitutes while in
Cartagena, Colombia, preparing for Obama’s arrival at a summit.
Six others are under investigation, as are a dozen members of
the U.S. military.  “What these guys were thinking I don’t know,” Obama,
traveling in  North Carolina , said during a taping of NBC’s
“Late Night With Jimmy Fallon” program. “That’s why they’re
not there anymore.”  Obama was interviewed for a show scheduled for broadcast
tonight following a speech to students at the University of
North Carolina in  Chapel Hill .  To contact the reporter on this story:
