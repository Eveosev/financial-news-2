China ’s net overseas financial
assets declined in the final quarter of 2011, a move  Credit
Agricole  CIB says may make the yuan more vulnerable to capital
outflows.  China’s holdings of overseas assets totaled $4.72 trillion
at the end of last year, $1.77 trillion more than foreigners’
ownership of Chinese assets, according to a  statement  on the
State Administration of Foreign Exchange website yesterday. The
gap was $1.89 trillion as of Sept. 30.  “The yuan appears somewhat vulnerable in the wake of
yesterday’s international investment position data, which showed
a dramatic plunge in the country’s net foreign assets,” Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based strategist at Credit Agricole,
wrote in a report today. “If the trend continues, the yuan
fundamentals will increasingly appear less stellar.”  The yuan has weakened 0.2 percent so far this year, making
it the second-worst performer among  Asia ’s 10 most-traded
currencies excluding the yen, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Indonesia ’s rupiah declined 1.4 percent.  The  Asian Development Bank  cut its estimate for China’s
economic growth this year to 8.5 percent from a September
forecast of 9.1 percent, according to an April 11 release. Gross
domestic product rose 8.1 percent in the first quarter of 2012,
the smallest gain since mid-2009.  Foreign holdings of Chinese equities fell by $3 billion in
the final three months of 2011 to $211 billion, according to
SAFE’s statement. Overseas ownership of China’s debt securities
more than doubled to $37 billion from $17 billion at end-
September.  “This may reflect either official buying or purchases by
Hong Kong banks after a recent relaxation of curbs on their
investments in the Mainland,” he said. “Either way, it seems
that the Chinese  bond market  is on the verge of becoming the
next hot area for foreign investment.”  The government raised the amount of yuan held offshore that
can be invested in the country’s bond and stock markets to 70
billion yuan ($11 billion) from 20 billion yuan on April 3. It
raised the quota for inflows of dollars to $80 billion from $30
billion.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
