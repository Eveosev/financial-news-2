Demand for solar panels in  Germany ,
the world’s largest market for the equipment, may hold up until
the third quarter, according to the biggest builder of sun-
powered plants.  The German government’s plans to cut solar subsidies by as
much as 29 percent hasn’t impacted demand as quickly as
expected, Bernhard Beck, chief executive officer of Belectric
Solarkraftwerke GmbH, said in an interview.  “No one would’ve imagined this but so far the volumes are
there,” Beck said. “It’s hard to assess.”  German solar installations may have more than tripled to
almost 1,800 megawatts in the first quarter from a year ago,
German Deputy Environment Minister Katherina Reiche said last
week.  Belectric installed 391 megawatts of photovoltaic capacity
globally in 2011, the most of any company, according to
California-based market researcher IHS Isuppli.  To contact the reporter on this story:
