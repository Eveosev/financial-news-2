Vectura Group Plc (VEC)  and  Novartis AG (NOVN) ’s
positive results in a late-stage study for the experimental
QVA149 treatment for smoker’s cough validates a competing drug
in development from  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) , Barclays Capital Inc.
analysts said.  While QVA149 showed superior lung function in the study
when compared with Glaxo’s best-selling Seretide, Glaxo and
partner  Theravance Inc. (THRX)  are also developing a new treatment
combining Glaxo’s 719 and 444 drugs, which are in the same
classes as the QVA149 combination medicine.  “We anticipate Glaxo’s product will be highly competitive,
packaged in a multidose dry powder inhaler, compared with
Novartis’s single-dose inhaler,” Barclays said in a note to
investors today. “Glaxo will also likely exert its respiratory
marketing strength to maximum effect.”  Glaxo deepened its 10-year collaboration with Theravance
this month by boosting its stake in the company to 27 percent
from 18 percent. The companies are developing new respiratory
drugs to help succeed Glaxo’s Seretide, marketed as Advair in
the U.S.  Three more studies on QVA149 will be completed this year,
and Chippenham, England-based Vectura expects U.S. regulatory
filings for QVA149 and NVA237 in 2014, according to a statement
today. Late-stage studies on 719 and 444 will probably be
released toward the end of this year or in early 2013, Barclays
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
