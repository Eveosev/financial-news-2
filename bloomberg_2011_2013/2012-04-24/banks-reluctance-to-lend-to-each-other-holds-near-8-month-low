European banks’ reluctance to lend
to one another held near the lowest level in more than eight
months, according to a money-market indicator.  The  Euribor-OIS spread , the difference between the euro
interbank offered rate and overnight indexed swaps, was little
changed at 40 basis points at 8:30 a.m. in London, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. The measure reached 39 on April 20, the
lowest level since the start of August last year.  The cost for banks to convert euro interest payments into
dollars was unchanged for the third day at the lowest in 8 1/2
months. The three-month cross-currency  basis swap  was 47.5 basis
points below Euribor.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 55 basis
points less than Euribor. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  Lenders’ cut  overnight deposits  at the European Central
Bank yesterday, placing 768 billion euros ($1 trillion) with the
Frankfurt-based lender from 776 billion euros on April 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
