The cost of insuring against
default on European sovereign and corporate debt fell, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments dropped 3.5 basis points to 281
at 9:40 a.m. in London. A decrease signals improving perceptions
of  credit quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings declined 13
basis points to 678. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125
companies with investment-grade ratings dropped 3.5 to 146 basis
points.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers declined six basis points to 257 and the
subordinated index dropped 7.5 to 414.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
