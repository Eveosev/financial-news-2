KBC Groep NV (KBC) ’s Czech unit, CSOB AS,
had the outlook on its A1 deposit rating cut to “negative”
from “stable” at Moody’s Investors Service, which cited the
parent company’s downgrade.  KBC’s ability to support Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, as
the lender is also known, has weakened, the ratings company
wrote in an e-mailed report today.  Moody’s cut KBC to A1 from Aa3 two days ago, citing doubts
that the Belgian firm can repay state aid by the end of 2013.
CSOB’s Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of financial strength,
shrank to 12.55 percent from 14.2 percent after the lender paid
a 17.8 billion-koruna ($970 million) dividend to KBC, more than
its 13.6 billion-koruna profit in 2010, Moody’s said.  “The rating announcement reflects Moody’s view of the
weakened ability of KBC Bank to support CSOB,” the rating
company said. Pressure to pay dividends to KBC could limit the
amount of cash at CSOB and “may over time negatively affect the
business and financial fundamentals of the bank,” Moody’s said.  Moody’s also cut its outlook on CSOB’s bank financial
strength rating at C, “which maps to A3 on the long-term
scale,” the rating company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
