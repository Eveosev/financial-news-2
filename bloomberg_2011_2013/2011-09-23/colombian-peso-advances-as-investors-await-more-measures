Colombia ’s peso rose from its
lowest level this year, amid speculation global central banks
will take coordinated measures to prevent a financial crisis.  The peso gained 0.3 percent to 1,903.94 per  U.S. dollar  at
3:25 p.m. New York time, from 1,910 yesterday. The currency
touched 1,932.50 yesterday, its weakest intraday level since
Dec. 30. The peso plunged 4.3 percent this week, its biggest
drop since the period ended June 19, 2009.  “Panic in markets yesterday led to overselling,” said
Santiago Melo, an analyst at Alianza Valores SA brokerage in
Bogota. “While turmoil in external markets is far from over,
investors are taking a step back today, waiting to see what the
next moves are.”  Europe ’s governments are speeding the setup of a permanent
rescue fund, an internal working paper shows. The  European
Central Bank  may step up efforts to ease financial-market
tensions, including offering banks 12-month loans, Governing
Council members said.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
rose three basis points, to 0.03 percentage point, to 7.69
percent. The bond’s price fell 0.292 centavo to 118.423 centavos
per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
