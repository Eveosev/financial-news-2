Investors may “turn away” from
 Hungary  as the country can no longer “guarantee the legal
security of investments,”  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  Chief Executive
Officer Andreas Treichl said, according to  Napi.hu .  The government’s “hostile” policies are likely to drive
investment to other nations such as the  Czech Republic , Slovakia
or  Romania , though Erste will remain in Hungary, the news portal
quoted Treichl as saying.  “We won’t let hostile economic policy that is detrimental
to the country chase us away,” Treichl told Napi.hu, adding
that development funds will be spent elsewhere.  Treichl has previously told Napi.hu that Erste’s Hungarian
subsidiary will receive the funding needed to maintain a solid
capital-adequacy ratio and sufficient liquidity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
