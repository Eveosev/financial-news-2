Deutsche Bank calculations show
writedowns on Greek sovereign debt holdings may exceed the 21
percent to which banks and insurers agreed, Handelsblatt said,
citing Charlotte Jones, a controller for the German lender.  The writedowns for the European institutions may amount to
25 percent or more, Jones said, according to the German
newspaper, which didnâ€™t specify where she made the comments.  The agreement on private sector involvement, or PSI, reached
at the end of July valued the return on Greek debt at 9 percent
while that figure is now at 13.75 percent or more, Handelsblatt
said.  If market rates of more than 9 percent are used, every
percentage point increase in the interest rates at which the PSI
is implemented will lead to an additional writedown for
investors of slightly more than 4 percentage points, the
newspaper cited Jones as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
