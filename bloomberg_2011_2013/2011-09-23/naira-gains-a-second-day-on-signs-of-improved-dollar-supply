Nigeria ’s naira strengthened,
gaining for a second day from a two-year low against the dollar
on expectations of improved foreign currency supply.  The currency of sub-Saharan Africa’s biggest oil producer
appreciated 0.5 percent to 156.45 naira per dollar in interbank
trading at 10:29 a.m. in Lagos, its strongest intraday level
since Sept. 16, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
depreciated on Sept. 21 to its weakest since Aug. 18, 2009 as
demand for foreign currency at the central bank’s auction
exceeded supply for the 21st straight sale.  Month-end dollar sales by international energy companies
operating in the country are expected next week, with the
central bank likely to increase supply at its twice-weekly
auctions, Johannesburg-based Absa Capital wrote in a note to
clients yesterday.  Nigeria has been using foreign-currency reserves to keep
the naira within a 3 percentage-point range above or below 150
naira a dollar at its auctions to help check inflation. The
 exchange rate  at the last auction on Sept. 21 was 2.9 percent
above 150 naira per dollar.  “Considering the relatively small size of the market, we
believe that the central bank will manage to keep the naira from
depreciating significantly from the current levels,” BNP
Paribas SA strategists based in  London  and led by  Bartosz Pawlowski , wrote in a note to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
