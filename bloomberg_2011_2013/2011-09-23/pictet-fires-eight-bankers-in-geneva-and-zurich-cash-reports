Pictet & Cie,  Switzerland ’s biggest
closely held private bank, said eight bankers, three in Zurich
and five at its headquarters in Geneva, departed last week as
part of a reorganization of its family services office.  The bankers, who included senior managers, worked for the
company’s family services for ultra-high-net-worth individuals
and for the global custody unit for private clients, Pictet
spokesman Simon Roth said by telephone today. The  Cash 
financial-news website reported the departures earlier today.  The divisions were partly integrated into the family
services business as part of a restructuring, Cash said.  The custody unit for institutional clients hasn’t been
affected by the reorganization, Roth said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
