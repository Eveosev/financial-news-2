India â€™s rupee strengthened for the
first time this week, rebounding from the weakest level since
2009, after central bank Deputy Governor  Subir Gokarn  told a
local television channel policy makers may intervene in the
market to curb volatility.  The rupee traded at 49.275 per dollar as of 12:44 p.m. in
Mumbai, 0.6 percent stronger from yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It fell to 49.89 earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
