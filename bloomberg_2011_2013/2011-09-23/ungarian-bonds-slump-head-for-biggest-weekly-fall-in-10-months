Hungary’s 10-year government bonds
weakened for a fifth day, extending the biggest weekly jump in
yields in 10 months.  The yield rose 20 basis points, or 0.2 percentage point, to
8.32 percent, according to generic prices compiled by Bloomberg.
That brings the week’s increase to 73 basis points, the most
since the five days through Nov. 26, 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
