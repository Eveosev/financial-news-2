India ’s consumption of oil products
grew at a slower rate in August, reflecting less growth in
industrial production and rising inflation.  Fuel consumption rose 3.2 percent from a year earlier to
11.32 million metric tons, according to preliminary government
data. Diesel, which accounted for about 40 percent of sales,
rose 6.4 percent to 4.56 million tons, and gasoline gained 4.5
percent to 1.22 million tons. The August figure compares with
July’s increase of 3.8 percent  The $1.7 trillion Indian economy grew at 7.7 percent in the
quarter ended in June, the slowest pace since the last quarter
of 2009. The nation’s central bank raised  interest rates  a dozen
times since the start of March 2010 as it tries to contain
higher food and fuel prices. Weakness in the rupee threatens to
keep inflation above 9 percent, a level exceeded in each of the
last nine months.  Use of imported LNG climbed 1.1 percent to 749,400 tons.
Jet-fuel sales grew 9.2 percent to 440,200 tons and liquefied
petroleum gas, used as cooking fuel and to power vehicles, rose
9.7 percent to 1.22 million tons.  Consumption of kerosene declined 11.5 percent to 671,000
tons. Naphtha, a chemical feedstock, climbed 5.2 percent to
814,300 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
