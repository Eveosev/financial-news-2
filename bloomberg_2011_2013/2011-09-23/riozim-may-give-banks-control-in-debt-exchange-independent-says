RioZim Ltd. (RIOTZ) , a Harare-based gold,
diamond and nickel miner, may hand a 51 percent stake to the
nation’s banks by converting outstanding debt into equity, the
 Zimbabwe Independent  said, citing unnamed company officials.  BancABC Ltd., listed in Botswana, is restructuring RioZim’s
debt after the company failed to repay loans, the Harare-based
newspaper said. It owes Trust Banking Corp. about $3.4 million
and as much as $7.5 million to Kingdom Financial Holdings Ltd.,
the Independent said. Another $5.9 million is owed to closely
held ZB Bank (Private) Ltd., according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
