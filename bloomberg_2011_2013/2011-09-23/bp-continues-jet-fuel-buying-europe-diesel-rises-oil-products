BP Plc extended its purchases of
European jet fuel cargoes, bringing its total to at least eight
this month. Diesel barge premiums gained as much as $6 a ton.  OAO Lukoil’s Litasco unit bought gasoil and diesel cargoes.  Light Products  The gasoline crack, a measure of refining profit, rose as
Brent dropped to the cheapest since Aug. 10. The front-month
crack rose to $4.58 a barrel, compared with $3.94 a barrel
yesterday, according to data from London-based from PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a crude and refined-product broker in  London .  Summer grade gasoline barges for immediate loading in
Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp traded at $983 a metric ton,
according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board and Platts pricing window,
which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. That’s up from deals
yesterday at $955 to $982. Winter grade changed hands at $935.  Statoil ASA, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Mabanaft BV sold,
while Litasco and Trafigura Beheer BV bought Eurobob blend, to
which ethanol is added to make finished fuel.  In  Europe , naphtha’s discount to Brent has averaged $5.22 a
barrel since July 1, PVM data showed. That’s down from a
discount of $3.71 a year earlier. It was at $4.37 today.  Middle Distillates  Diesel barge premiums rose for a fourth day, according to
the survey of Platts. Deals were done at a premium of $32 to
October gasoil, with BP Plc and Vitol Group among the buyers.
That compares with trades yesterday at $26 and $27 more than
October gasoil.  Mabanaft sold a 20,000-ton shipment of  diesel fuel  to
Litasco at a $43 premium to October gasoil for delivery to  Le
Havre . Litasco also bought a consignment from Vitol at $44, and
Cargill Inc. also sold to Preem AB at the same level. That
compares to cargoes traded yesterday for $38 and $37 more than
ICE gasoil.  BP bought another cargo of jet fuel from Morgan Stanley at
a higher premium. The consignment traded at a $67 more than
October gasoil, versus $66.50 on Sept. 21.  Barges of heating oil changed hands at parity to October
gasoil futures. The fuel last changed hands at $2 less than
October gasoil on Sept. 21. BP sold to Total SA twice.  Litasco purchased a gasoil cargo from Gunvor Group Ltd. at
a $6 premium to October gasoil for delivery to Genoa,  Italy .  Gasoil for October delivery fell as much as $17, or 1.9
percent, to $886.75 a ton, the lowest since Aug. 10, on the ICE
exchange.  The contract was at $894.75 a ton as of 4:55 p.m. London
time, a premium of $5.25 to November. A market is described as
being in backwardation when contracts nearest to delivery cost
more than later-dated shipments. This usually signals near-term
scarcity of supply or rising demand.  Residues  Low-sulfur fuel oil declined to $626 a ton, compared with
$631 a ton yesterday, the Platts survey showed. High-sulfur fuel
oil deals were done from $603.25 to $606, dropping from $606.75
to $611 a ton the previous session.  To contact the reporter on this story:
