Barclays Plc (BARC) , the U.K.’s second-
largest bank by assets, said Michael Rake will become senior
independent director replacing Richard Broadbent who retires on
Sept. 30.  Rake is chairman of the lender’s audit committee and takes
up the new role on Oct. 1, the London-based bank said today in a
statement. Barclays said in May that Broadbent, who is also
deputy chairman, would step down after accepting the position of
chairman at  Tesco Plc. (TSCO)   Broadbent joined Barclays’s board in September 2003, after
retiring as executive chairman of the U.K.’s customs office.
Before that, he was a member of the group executive committee of
Schroders Plc and a non-executive director of the Securities
Institute. Rake is chairman of BT Group Plc and a former
chairman of KPMG International.  Broadbent “has provided invaluable support to me in his
role as deputy chairman and senior independent director,
particularly during the recent financial crisis,” Barclays
Chairman Marcus Agius said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
