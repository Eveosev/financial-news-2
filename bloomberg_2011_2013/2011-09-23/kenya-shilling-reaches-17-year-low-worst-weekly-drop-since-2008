Kenya ’s shilling headed for the
biggest weekly drop since since October 2008 as concern that
global growth will slow reduced demand for riskier frontier-
market assets.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy added 0.3
percent to 98.92 per dollar by 10:29 a.m. in Nairobi, the
capital, reversing a decline to 98.92, the weakest intraday
level since March 1994. The currency has lost 4 percent this
week, the most since the five days through Oct. 28, 2008.  “Emerging markets are still jittery, with flight to the
relatively safety of the U.S. dollar as global uncertainty about
another recession remains high,” Duncan Kinuthia a dealer at
Nairobi-based Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said in a phone
interview.  Central bankers and finance ministers will discuss the
economic outlook today at the annual meetings of the
 International Monetary Fund  and  World Bank  in Washington. The
 Federal Reserve  on Sept. 21 said it will replace $400 billion of
short-term debt with longer-term Treasuries, saying it sees
“significant downside risks” to growth.  The world economy will expand 4 percent this year and next,
the International Monetary Fund said on Sept. 20, cutting
forecasts made in June for a 4.3 percent expansion this year and
4.5 percent in 2012.  Kenya’s shilling has depreciated 18 percent this year,
making it the world’s worst performer after South Africa’s rand,
to which Namibia, Swaziland and Lesotho’s currencies are pegged,
and Uganda’s shilling.
