Google Inc. (GOOG)  executive Dennis Woodside will take charge of integrating the $12.5 billion
Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. acquisition, which the company
announced last month.  Margo Georgiadis, who is departing as Groupon Inc.’s chief
operating officer, will take Woodside’s old job, Nikesh Arora,
Google’s senior vice president and chief business officer, said
today. In his new role, Woodside will work with Sanjay Jha,
Motorola Mobility’s chief executive officer.  “He wanted a new and exciting challenge,” Arora said in
an interview. “We wanted a capable pair of hands.”  Google, the world’s biggest Internet-search company,
announced plans to buy Motorola Mobility on Aug. 15 in a bid to
bolster its intellectual property. Motorola Mobility brings more
than 17,000 patents that Google can use in its Android software,
which faces legal challenges from Oracle Corp. and other
companies for allegedly violating patents.  As part of his role, Woodside will report to Chief
Financial Officer Patrick Pichette, CEO  Larry Page  and Arora.  Woodside took over in 2009 for Tim Armstrong, who left the
company to become CEO of Web portal AOL Inc. Georgiadis left
Google earlier this year to join Groupon.  Google, based in Mountain View,  California , rose $4.85 to
$525.51 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The
shares have fallen 12 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
