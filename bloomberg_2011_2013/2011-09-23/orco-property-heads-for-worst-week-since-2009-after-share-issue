Orco Property Group (ORCO)  SA dropped for
a sixth day, heading for its biggest weekly slump in 2 1/2
years, after the Czech developer said yesterday it issued 3
million new shares to funds advised by Morgan Stanley Real
Estate Investing.  The stock slid 2.9 percent to 102 koruna as of 10:48 a.m.
in Prague. A close at that level would mark a 15 percent weekly
decline, Orcoâ€™s biggest since February 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
