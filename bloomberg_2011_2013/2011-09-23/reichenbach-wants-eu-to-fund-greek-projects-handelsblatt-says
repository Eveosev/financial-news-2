Horst Reichenbach, who heads a
European Union task force on rebuilding  Greece ’s economy, wants
to use the EU’s structural funds to finance infrastructure
projects in the country,  Handelsblatt  reported today.  Seventy percent of the 20 billion euros ($27 billion) in
the funds haven’t been used and could fill the gap left by the
withdrawal of private investors, Reichenbach told the newspaper.  Greece can earn money from tourism, solar energy and
agriculture, and companies must increase productivity and lower
wages to improve competitiveness, Reichenbach was cited by
Handelsblatt as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
