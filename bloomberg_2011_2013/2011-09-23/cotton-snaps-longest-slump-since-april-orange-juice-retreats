Cotton rose the most in two weeks,
snapping the longest slump since April, on signs the decline
spurred demand in  China , the world’s top consumer.  Orange juice 
fell.  In the week ended Sept. 15, purchases from overseas buyers
resulted in U.S. net cotton exports of 65,900 bales, including
15,400 to  China , the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said
yesterday. The U.S. is the world’s largest shipper. The
commodity still declined 8.4 percent this week and has plunged
54 percent since reaching a record $2.197 a pound on March 7.  “There’s been actual physical demand,” Chris Kramedjian,
a senior risk-management consultant at INTL FCStone in
Nashville, Tennessee, said in a telephone interview. “We are
getting to a price that works for spinning mills. There is talk
of buying from China and other Asian markets.”  Cotton futures for December delivery rose 1.95 cents, or 2
percent, to settle at $1.0124 at 2:40 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in  New York . That’s the biggest gain since Sept. 8.  Orange-juice futures for November delivery dropped 3.4
cents, or 2.1 percent, to $1.5525 a pound on ICE. Earlier, the
price touched $1.549, the lowest for a most-active contract
since Aug. 11. The commodity dropped 4.6 percent this week and
is down 1.2 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
