Rents for capesize ships that haul
iron ore and coal rose to the highest level in almost 10 months
as rates paid on one route reached $50,000, the most paid since
November.  Average hire costs climbed 4.2 percent to $28,888 a day
today, the highest level since Dec. 6, according to the  Baltic
Exchange , a London-based provider of freight rates on 29 dry-
bulk routes. The Baltic Dry Index, a broader measure of
commodity-shipping costs, gained 1.9 percent to 1,920.  A shortage of immediately available ships in the Atlantic
Ocean region pushed the last recorded booking for a trip to
 China  from  Brazil  to $50,000 a day, according to the  exchange .
Rents last exceeded that level on Nov. 24, based on a list
tallied by the exchange. Rates on the route were as low as
$16,000 in early July, the list showed.  Capesize rates have more than tripled since Aug. 1. The
rally is continuing because the three top iron-ore producers are
seeking more ships to export cargoes, with some bookings as far
ahead as the middle of October, the exchange said in a report e-
mailed today.  Vale SA (VALE5) , Rio Tinto Group and BHP Billiton Ltd. accounted
for 58 percent of the 989 million metric tons of ore shipped by
sea in 2010, according to a July report by the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development. The ore is a steelmaking
raw material, and China is the top global steel producer. Vale
is based in Rio de Janeiro.  40% of Capacity  The world dry-bulk fleet contains 1,291 capesizes that make
up about 40 percent of total capacity, according to Clarkson
Research Services Ltd., a unit of the worldâ€™s biggest
shipbroker.  The index has averaged about 1,414 this year, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. The dry-bulk fleet of more than 8,500 ships
faces a vessel glut that depressed the gauge to average levels
last seen eight years ago, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said
last month. Too many new vessels were ordered when rates boomed,
and demand is unlikely to catch up with supply until 2014, the
bank said.  Rents for the three dry-bulk vessel types smaller than
capesizes tracked by the gauge averaged the lowest levels to
date this quarter since the first three months of 2009,
according to the exchange.  Panamaxes, the largest ships that can navigate the Panama
Canal, have averaged $12,818 this quarter, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Rates averaged $10,009 for handysizes and
$13,864 for supramaxes. By contrast, average capesize rents are
almost double last quarter and the highest level in six months
at $16,236.  Daily panamax rents slipped 0.1 percent to $13,142 today,
according to the exchange. Supramaxes, which carry about 25
percent less cargo, gained 0.5 percent to $15,460 and
handysizes, the smallest ships tracked by the index, rose 0.5
percent to $10,194.  To contact the reporter on this story:
