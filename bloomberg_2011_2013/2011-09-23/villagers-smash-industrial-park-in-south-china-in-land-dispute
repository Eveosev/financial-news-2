Villagers in  China ’s southern
province of Guangdong attacked a police station, injuring more
than 10 officers, after smashing facilities at an industrial
park because of a land dispute,  the local government said .  About 200 villagers from Lufeng city destroyed security
guard houses and sheds at the park after a group gathered at an
old cinema shouting slogans on Sept. 21, according to a
statement on the local government’s website.  The following day, they attacked the police station and
damaged six police cars after rumors that officers had beaten a
child to death, according to the statement.  Protests are increasing across China as income gaps widen.
Riots, strikes and demonstrations doubled in five years to
180,000 in 2010, Sun Liping, a professor at Beijing’s Tsinghua
University, said in a Feb. 25 article in the Economic Observer.  Authorities detained 31 villagers after protests over
pollution at a solar factory that saw hundreds gather at the
plant in the city of Haining from Sept. 15 to Sept. 17.
Villagers blamed the factory for killing fish in a nearby river.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
