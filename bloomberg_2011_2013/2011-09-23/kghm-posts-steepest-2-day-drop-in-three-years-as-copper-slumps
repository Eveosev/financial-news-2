KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH) , Poland’s sole
copper producer, posted the steepest two-day drop in almost
three years as copper slumped on concern demand for raw
materials will slow.  The stock plunged 5.2 percent to 132.2 zloty at 9:46 a.m.
in Warsaw, extending yesterday’s 13 percent drop. The benchmark
WIG20 Index, in which the state-controlled producer has a 13.6
percent weighting, declined 1.9 percent today.  Copper for delivery in three months fell as much as 7.3
percent to $7,115.75 per metric ton on the London Metal Exchange
today, the lowest price since August 2010, amid the deepening
European debt crisis and the threat of a U.S. recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
