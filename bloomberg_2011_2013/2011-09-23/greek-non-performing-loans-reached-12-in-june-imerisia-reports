Greek bank loans on which
instalments had been unpaid for more than 90 days reached 12
percent in June,  Imerisia  reported, citing bank officials.  That was up from 11.5 percent in March and 10.4 percent in
December 2010; the level of non-performing loans is likely to
rise faster in the third and fourth quarters because of falling
disposable income in  Greece , the newspaper said.  The total loan value in June was 250 billion euros ($338
billion), Imerisia said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
