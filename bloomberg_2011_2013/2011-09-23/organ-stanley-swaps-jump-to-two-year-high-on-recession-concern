Credit-default swaps on  Morgan
Stanley (MS)  surged to the highest level in more than two years amid
concern the global economic recovery is fading.  The cost to protect the New York-based bank’s debt for five
years climbed 30.1 basis points to 435 basis points, the highest
level since March 10, 2009, according to data provider CMA. One-
year contracts jumped 55.5 basis points to 505.8, signaling that
traders are pricing in a greater probability of credit
deterioration in the short term.  “An inverted curve for a financial services firm is never
a good thing,” said Bonnie Baha, head of global developed
credit group at DoubleLine Capital LP, which has $16 billion in
assets under management. “I’m still pretty concerned about the
banks.” Morgan Stanley lacks the deposit bases of many of its
peers, she said.  Five-year credit-default swaps on New York-based  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  increased for a sixth day, adding 9 basis
points to 297, the data show.  Contracts on  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  eased 2.3 basis points to
150.4, those on  Citigroup Inc. (C)  were little changed at 280.5, and
those on  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  fell 2.8 basis points to 153.2,
the data show. Contracts on  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  dropped from
the highest level since March 2009, declining 9.4 basis points
to 390.6, the data show.  ‘Very Volatile’  Swaps on Morgan Stanley pared an earlier jump to as high as
a mid-price of 470 basis points, according to broker Phoenix
Partners Group, on signs policy makers will act to prevent the
debt crisis from worsening. The swaps typically rise as investor
confidence deteriorates and fall as it improves.  “Today the market in general is just very, very volatile,
and we’ve seen some as much as 50 wider and back to unchanged,”
John Guarnera, a financial analyst at Societe Generale SA in  New
York , said in a telephone interview.  The Markit Group Ltd. CDX North America High Yield Index,
which falls as investor confidence deteriorates, climbed 0.2
percentage points to 91.8 percent of face value as of 5:20 p.m.
in New York, according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd.
Earlier it fell as much as 0.8 percentage points. It’s decreased
for four of six days, and it fell to 91.3 on Sept. 12, which was
the least since September 2009.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
