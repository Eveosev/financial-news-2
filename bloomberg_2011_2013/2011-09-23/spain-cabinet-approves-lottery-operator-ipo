Spain ’s Cabinet approved the
initial public offering of the country’s state-owned lottery
operator, which could be the largest asset sale in the nation’s
history.  “The state can sell up to 30 percent” of Sociedad Estatal
Loterias & Apuestas del Estado SA, Development Minister Jose Blanco said at a news conference in Madrid today. The sale is
planned for the end of October.  Spain aims to use the proceeds of the sale to shrink
borrowing needs as the government tries to reduce its  budget
deficit . The IPO may raise as much as 7 billion euros ($9.4
billion), the most in Spain’s history, a person with knowledge
of the deal said on Sept. 19, though the price hasn’t been set.
Loterias will price the IPO around Oct. 17, said the person, who
declined to be identified as the process is private.  Loterias is wooing investors by offering more than 80
percent of its profit in dividends, said two people close to the
deal.  Loterias, which had 2.6 billion euros of profit in 2010,
will list on exchanges in  Madrid , Barcelona, Bilbao and
Valencia, according to the term sheet obtained by Bloomberg.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., UBS AG,
Credit Suisse Group AG, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA and
Banco Santander SA are lead managers for the IPO, Loterias said
in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
