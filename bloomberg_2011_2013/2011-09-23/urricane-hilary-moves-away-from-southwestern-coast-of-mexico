Hurricane Hilary, a Category 4
storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale with top winds of
145 miles per hour, has started moving away from southwestern
coast of  Mexico , the National Hurricane Center said.  Hilary was 120 miles (190 kilometers) south of the Pacific
coastal resort of Zihuatanejo and moving west at about 10 mph,
the center said in a 5 a.m. New York time  advisory .  “The core of Hilary should continue moving farther
offshore,” it said, warning of heavy rain in parts of southern
Mexico and dangerous surf. “Some fluctuations in strength are
likely today, followed by slow weakening by Saturday.”  Mexico’s government posted a tropical-storm warning from
Acapulco to Punta San Telmo and a tropical-storm watch from
Punta San Telmo to the coastal resort of Manzanillo, according
to the Miami-based center.  While Hilary is a “powerful Category 4 hurricane,”
 Tropical Storm Ophelia , the 15th named system of the Atlantic
season that runs through November, was about 740 miles east-
southeast of the Leeward Islands, the NHC said.  The system, moving west-northwest at 13 mph, weakened to
sustained winds of 45 mph and could become a tropical depression
this weekend, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
