BNP Paribas SA,  France ’s largest
bank, has enough capital to meet international liquidity rules,
Everett Schenk, chief executive officer of the lender’s North
American operations, said.  “We can achieve Tier 1 target ratios under Basel III” by
2013 without seeking external funds, Schenk said today in a CNBC
interview. “Our exposure to Greece, at $3.5 billion relative to
$7.5 billion first-half profits, regardless of your writedown,
we consider to be manageable.”  BNP shares have dropped 47 percent this year amid  Europe ’s
debt crisis. BNP Paribas and Societe Generale SA, France’s
second-biggest bank, rose today in Paris trading on speculation
the French government will take steps to bolster their capital.  “Increasingly nervous wholesale funding and equity markets
may trigger short-term French government action to support its
banks,” Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc analysts Jorge Mayo
and Stefan Stalmann wrote in a note today. “The French
government would be more likely to resort once more to loss-
absorbing instruments other than common equity.”  BNP Paribas (BNP)  isn’t seeking investment from Qatar, Schenk
said in the interview. Baudouin Prot, the bank’s CEO, said
yesterday that the lender wasn’t looking to raise funds from the
 Middle East .  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
