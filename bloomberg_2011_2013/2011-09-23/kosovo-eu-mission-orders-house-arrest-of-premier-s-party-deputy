A European Union mission to Kosovo
ordered a house arrest for Fatmir Limaj, a deputy head of the
country’s ruling party, on war-crime charges during a conflict
with  Serbia  more than a decade ago.  Limaj was a senior commander of the Albanian guerilla
movement known as Kosovo Liberation Army, which fought Serb
forces in 1999 before North Atlantic Treaty Organization pushed
Serb forces out of the province. Limaj is charged with murder,
torture of Kosovo Albanians, Serb civilians and prisoners of war
in the area of Klecka, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of
capital Pristina.  The EU mission’s pre-trial judge at the District Court of
Pristina ordered a month-long house detention for Limaj as well
as a temporary confiscation of his travel documents, the mission
said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday.  Limaj, the deputy head of the  Democratic Party  of Kosovo of
Prime Minister Hashim Thaci, is a former transport minister. He
now has no Cabinet position. Still, the house arrest may weaken
Thaci’s position as several of his lawmakers may form their own
parliamentary group as a result of it, Behlul Beqaj, a Kosovo
political analyst, said in a phone interview.  Kosovo and Serbia seek to ease post-war relations that are
still rattled by occasional escalations. Serbia needs to improve
ties with its former province, as it seeks to win the EU
candidate status by the end of the year. Kosovo wants to gain a
visa-free access to the EU, the only nation from former
 Yugoslavia  that has yet to win the privilege.
