Canada ’s dollar was little changed,
after rising from almost the lowest level since October versus
its U.S. counterpart, as investors tried to gauge whether
officials will take steps to prevent another global recession.  The currency, nicknamed the loonie for the image of the
bird on the C$1 coin, had its biggest weekly loss versus its
U.S. counterpart since the depths of the financial crisis almost
three years ago. Oil, Canada’s biggest export, fell and stocks
trimmed gains.  “The market is on absolute pins and needles, and the
loonie is so volatile right now,” said  Steve Butler , managing
director of foreign-exchange trading at Bank of Nova Scotia’s
Scotia Capital unit in Toronto. “The ‘R’ word is starting to
come back in a lot of people’s conversations.”  The Canadian currency was little changed at C$1.0281 per
 U.S. dollar  at 5 p.m. in Toronto, after dropping earlier as much
as 0.6 percent to C$1.0349 and gaining as much as 0.6 percent to
C$1.0225. It closed yesterday at C$1.0284 after touching
C$1.0361, the weakest level since Oct. 19. One Canadian dollar
buys 97.27 cents.  The loonie’s 5.1 percent weekly drop was the biggest
decrease since October 2008.  Volatility in the U.S. dollar versus its Canadian
counterpart was at almost a 16-month high. One-month implied
volatility on the  currency pair  touched 15.6 percent after
climbing to 16 percent yesterday, the most since May 2010. It
was 10.1 percent on Aug. 31.  Implied volatility, which traders quote and use to set
option prices, signals the expected pace of swings in the
underlying currency.  Relative Strength Index  The 14-day relative strength index for the loonie versus
the U.S. currency declined to 29, falling below 30 for a second
day. A reading lower than 30 signals that an asset may be due
for a rebound.  Canada’s government bonds fell, pushing yields up after
they touched the lowest levels on record earlier today.
Benchmark 10-year note yields were up five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 2.08 percent after earlier dropping to
1.994 percent. Five-year yields rose seven basis points to 1.35
percent after touching 1.255 percent. Thirty-year yields
increased three basis points to 2.71 percent after falling
earlier to 2.67 percent.  The Group of 20 nations pledged to tackle rising risks to
the global economy and pushed  Europe  to contain its sovereign
debt crisis amid concern the world is on the brink of another
recession. G-20 officials said in Washington they were
“committed to a strong and coordinated international response
to address the renewed challenges facing the global economy.”  ECB Officials  Commodities and stocks rose earlier as European Central
Bank Governing Council members said policy makers may step up
efforts to boost growth and ease financial-market tensions as
early as next month. Austria’s Ewald Nowotny and  Belgium ’s Luc Coene said in Washington that potential measures include the
reintroduction of 12-month loans to banks.  Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said European governments
must boost the size of a fund protecting the region’s banks to
contain the risks from the Greek government’s struggle to repay
its debt. He spoke to reporters at the International Monetary
Fund meeting in  Washington  today.  Canada’s dollar has lost 3 percent this year versus nine
developed-nation peers tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Currency Indexes. The greenback rose 0.3 percent, and the yen
climbed 6.9 percent.  Crude oil for November delivery fell 0.8 percent to $79.85
a barrel in  New York  after dropping 3.7 percent earlier.  Raw
materials  including oil account for about half of Canadian
export revenue. About three-quarters of the nation’s exports go
to the U.S.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.6 percent after
rising earlier as much as 1.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
