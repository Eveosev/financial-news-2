Venezuela  will work with Iranian
companies to mine for minerals in the southeastern part of the
South American country, Mining Minister Jose Khan said.  Studies carried out by Iranian companies have found a
deposit of gold, Khan said today in a statement.  Iran  in 2009 agreed to help Venezuela find deposits of
minerals including uranium, gold and coltan. The U.S. in May
announced sanctions against state-owned oil company Petroleos de
Venezuela SA for supporting Iran’s energy industry by delivering
cargoes of gasoline additive to Iran this year.  Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  and Iran’s Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad have forged diplomatic and commercial ties as Iran
faces international sanctions over suspicions it is trying to
develop nuclear power. Ahmadinejad will visit Venezuela
tomorrow, Chavez said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
