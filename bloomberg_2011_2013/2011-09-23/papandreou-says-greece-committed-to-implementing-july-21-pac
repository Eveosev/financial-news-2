Greek Prime Minister  George
Papandreou  said the government was determined to proceed with
the implementation of the July 21 decision for a second
financing package.  “Since much is said and written, many scenarios, I want to
stress once again, that our decision is to complete the July
agreement,” Papandreou told ruling party lawmakers, according
to an e-mailed transcript from his Athens-based office. He ruled
out any thought of early elections, saying the country was going
through “a critical period, definitive for the future.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
