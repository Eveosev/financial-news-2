India said the outlook for a self-
sustaining global recovery has been “undermined,” and policy
makers in crisis-hit nations must speed up financial reform.  Indian Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee , in a statement
released at the meeting of the  International Monetary Fund  in
Washington, also said the effectiveness of the IMF’s lending
program will depend on its “ability to identify triggers of
systemic crises well before their onset, and quickly assuring
needed backstops.”  “Recent global developments have considerably undermined
the prospects of a self-sustaining recovery,” Mukherjee said in
the statement. “Political inflexibility and an apparent lack of
will in responding to these problems have severely weakened
business and consumer confidence.”  He urged that “policy makers in crisis-hit economies must
accelerate repair and reform of the financial sector and take
steps to repair market confidence in sovereign debt
sustainability.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
