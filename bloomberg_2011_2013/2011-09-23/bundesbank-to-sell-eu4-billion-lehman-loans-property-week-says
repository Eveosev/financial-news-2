The German central bank has
appointed AgFe to help it sell more than 4 billion euros ($5.38
billion) of real estate loans swapped by  Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  in 2008 in what may be one of the biggest
distressed sales in European property history,  Property Week 
reported, without saying how it obtained the information.  A sale may come in the last three months of the year,
according to the report. The bonds and loans sale, code-named
“Excalibur,” may attract private equity interest, Property
Week said. Lehman swapped the portfolio with the  European
Central Bank  in an attempt to prevent its collapse, the
publication said.  “The realization of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc
collateral is an ongoing process, in which the Bundesbank is
being advised by AgFe,” a spokesman for the Bundesbank said,
declining to comment on any further details.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
