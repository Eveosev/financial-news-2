European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  said that the overall situation in  Europe  is
very different to the perception, which is the “paradox” of
Europe.  With the overall public finance deficit around 4.5 percent
for the euro area “we are at level which is far below what is
observed in other advanced economies,” Trichet said in a speech
in  Washington  today.  “Overall, the picture is very very different from the
perception,” Trichet said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
