Kia Motors Corp. (000270)  will add a third
shift at its Slovak factory in the first quarter of next year as
production is set to increase.  The factory in Zilina, Northern  Slovakia , will as early as
this month start hiring new workers, Dusan Dvorak, the spokesman
for the Slovak unit, said in an e-mailed statement today. The
South Korean carmaker will add 1,000 jobs in Slovakia to meet
rising demand for existing models and prepare for a start of
assembly of an unspecified new model, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
