HSH Nordbank  AG, the Hamburg-based
lender bailed out during the global financial crisis, said its
core Tier 1 capital ratio would be at least 9.1 percent in a
stress test scenario after the European Union approved the
German lenderâ€™s bailout package on Sept. 20.  An article in Financial Times regarding the
recapitalization of HSH Nordbank is incorrect, Rune Hoffmann, a
spokesman for HSH Nordbank said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
