U.S. stocks rose, after a four-day
drop erased 7.1 percent from the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index,
amid speculation that central banks will take action this
weekend to prevent another financial crisis.  The  S&P 500  rose 0.6 percent to 1,136.05 at 10:51 a.m. New
York time.  “You’d expect to see some stability after an aggressive
selloff, but it’s Friday and the question is -- do investors
want to go long over the weekend?” Alan Gayle, a senior
strategist at RidgeWorth Capital Management in Richmond,
Virginia, which oversees about $48 billion, said in a telephone
interview. “The ECB is saying good things, but the market is
looking for more tangible steps.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
