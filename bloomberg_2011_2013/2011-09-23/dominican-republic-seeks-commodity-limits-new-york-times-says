The  Dominican Republic  will propose
a resolution to the  United Nations  seeking to limit so-called
large trading positions in food and oil as it blamed speculators
for price swings, New York Times said, citing the president.  The nation will ask the UN to set position limits and
require investors to post more margin payments when trading, the
report said, citing President Leonel Fernandez.  To contact the reporter on this story:
