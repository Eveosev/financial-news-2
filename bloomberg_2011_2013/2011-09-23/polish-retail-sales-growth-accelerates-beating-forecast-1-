Poland’s  unemployment rate  increased
to 11.7 percent in September as seasonal summer work in tourism
and agriculture ended, the Labor Ministry said.  The number of jobless totaled 1.86 million, with the rate
rising from 11.6 percent in August, the ministry said in a
preliminary estimate sent by e-mail.  Poland’s economy, the only one in the European Union to
avoid a recession in 2009, has shown signs of slowing less than
others in the bloc as the sovereign-debt crisis damps demand for
its exports. The number of new jobs offered by employers fell by
4,000 from August to 68,500, according to the ministry.  “The movement on the Polish labor market is still only of
a seasonal nature and we see no impact from the threat of an
economic slowdown for now,” Labor Minister Jolanta Fedak said
at a press conference yesterday. “We also think keeping decent
growth of between 3.5 percent to 4 percent next year shouldn’t
cause any major risk to our labor market.”  She added that “it would be improbable” to lower the
unemployment rate to below 11 percent this year as the
government planned.  To contact the reporters on this story:
