William Lie Zeckendorf, co-chairman
of real estate firm Terra Holdings LLC, sold his apartment at
927 Fifth Avenue in  New York  for $34.6 million, getting $5.5
million more than he paid for it nine months ago.  The apartment’s quick sale and steep price tag were a
“function of scarcity,” said  John Burger , a broker at New
York-based Terra’s Brown Harris Stevens who represented
Zeckendorf in the deal. The co-operative apartment had been on
the market since June with an asking price of $31.5 million.  “This apartment represents the best of the best,” Burger
said today in a telephone interview. “It’s pre-war, it’s a full
floor, it has light in every room and it has wonderful views
because it’s way above the tree line.”  Hedge-fund executive Scott Bommer and his wife Donya, a
former anchor of the “Good Day Philadelphia” television show,
bought the apartment, the New York Times reported yesterday on
its website.  Zeckendorf, a developer of the luxury building  15 Central
Park West , bought the apartment in December from the estate of
 Bruce Wasserstein , the chief executive of  Lazard Ltd. (LAZ)  who died
in 2009, for $29.1 million. He then put the co-op back on the
market in June.  The 11th floor unit has five bedrooms, 5 1/2 bathrooms, a
library, private elevator and a corner living room with direct
views of Central Park, according to the listing on property
website  StreetEasy.com .  Bommer, president of SAB Capital Management LP in New York,
declined to comment on the purchase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
