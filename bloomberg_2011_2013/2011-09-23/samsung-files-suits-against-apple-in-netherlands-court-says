Samsung Electronics Co. filed four
lawsuits against  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  in the Netherlands and the first
hearing in the cases is scheduled for Sept. 26, according to The
Hague court.  “There will be hearings on four different suits,”
according to a court spokeswoman, who didn’t want to comment on
the content of the complaints and declined to be identified
citing court policy.  Dutch website  Webwereld.nl  reported Samsung is claiming the
Cupertino, California-based company’s iPhone and iPad that use
3G technology infringe Samsung patents. Samsung is seeking a ban
of the sale of such products in The Netherlands, Webwereld said.  The legal battle between Apple and rival smartphone makers
is intensifying as an increasing number of consumers use
smartphones and wireless handsets to surf the Web, play games
and download music and videos. Samsung lost a preliminary court
ruling over sales of its Galaxy S, S II and Ace smartphones in
the country in another patent dispute with Apple last month.  Samsung declined to comment on the planned hearing. Apple
didn’t have an immediate comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
