New World Resources Plc had its
price estimate cut by 44 percent at JPMorgan Chase & Co., which
said it reduced its earnings forecast for the largest Czech
producer of coking coal.  JPMorgan cut the projection for NWR’s London-traded shares
to 530 pence from 940 pence, analyst Roger Bell in  London  wrote
in a report to clients today. The U.S. broker kept its
“neutral” recommendation for the stock.  NWR fell 0.5 percent to 485 pence by 9:24 a.m. in London,
extending its decline this week to 13 percent. The stock has
lost 50 percent since the end of last year. In  Prague , NWR’s
home market, the stock rose 1.3 percent to 135.9 koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
