U.K. stocks erased gains, led by a
selloff in mining companies.  The FTSE 100 Index was little changed at 5,044.68 at 8:26
a.m. in London. The gauge earlier rallied as much as 1.3
percent, rebounding from yesterdayâ€™s biggest selloff in more
than two years.  Fresnillo Plc (FRES) ,  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO)  and  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED) 
all declined more than 2 percent in London trading.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
