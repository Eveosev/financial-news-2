Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said European governments must boost the size of a fund
protecting the region’s banks to contain the risks from the
Greek government’s struggle to repay its debt.  “What I see is a grave challenge for Greece to meet its
obligations,” Flaherty told reporters at the  International
Monetary Fund  in  Washington  today.  Policy makers are struggling to assure investors there is a
solution to indebted European governments and banks and that
U.S. stimulus will sustain a recovery in the world’s largest
economy. The G-20 released a statement last night where the euro
region vowed to increase the flexibility of the European
Financial Stability Facility and to “maximize its impact” by
the time the group next meets in Paris on Oct. 14-15, which
Flaherty said is just part of the answer.  While European policy makers made “some progress last
night,” they are “not quite there yet,” he said.  “We have been pressing the need to have adequate capacity
in the European facility in order to deal with bank
recapitalization in  Europe ,” he said. “Our view is it needs to
be larger to have the clear capacity to overwhelm the problem.”  On his own economy, Flaherty reiterated his plan to
eliminate Canada’s budget deficit in the year that begins in
April, 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
