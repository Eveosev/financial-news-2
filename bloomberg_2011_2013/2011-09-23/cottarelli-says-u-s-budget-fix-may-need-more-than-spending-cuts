Reducing the  U.S. budget deficit 
over the medium term may require more than just cuts in
government spending, said  Carlo Cottarelli , director of fiscal
affairs at the International Monetary Fund.  “The magnitude of the fiscal adjustment in the U.S. is so
large that it will be difficult to do only on the spending
side,” Cottarelli said in an interview with Tom Keene on
Bloomberg Television. Still, “the bulk of it will be on the
spending side and should include reforms on entitlements.”  Cottarelli also that the fiscal account needs to be fixed
“gradually, not all of a sudden because that would be bad for
the economy.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
