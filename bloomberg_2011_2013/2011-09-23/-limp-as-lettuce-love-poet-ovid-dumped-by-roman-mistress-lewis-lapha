The Rome of Ovid’s time was devoted
to self-indulgence. Aristocrats amused themselves with endless
parties, theatrical performances, circuses and sexual
adventures.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Married at 16 to his first wife, Ovid was the era’s supreme
chronicler of women, love and sex. In his 18 B.C.E best-seller,
“Amores,” the poet celebrated his gorgeous and passionate
mistress, Corinna, she of the lustrous auburn hair and
curvaceous bottom.  After several intense years, Corinna dumped him for a
virile soldier. As Ovid lamented in his verse, “When I held her
I was limp as yesterday’s lettuce,” adding, “I couldn’t get my
pleasure-part to work.”  I spoke with Elizabeth Abbott, author of “Mistresses: A
History of the Other Woman,” on the following topics:  1. Vessels of Seed  2. East vs. West  3. Ovid’s Corinna  4. Bastards  5. Post-Sexual Revolution  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
