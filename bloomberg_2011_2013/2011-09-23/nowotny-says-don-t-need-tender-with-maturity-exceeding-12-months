European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said he sees “no need” for
liquidity tenders with a maturity longer than 12 months.  There is “no need for longer-term loans than 12 months,”
Nowotny told reporters in  Washington  today. “We have an
established toolkit so there is no need” to go beyond.  To contact the reporter on this story:
