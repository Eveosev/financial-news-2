Capita Group Plc (CPI) , the provider of a
criminal-records service for the U.K. Home Office, agreed to buy
Cedar HR Software Ltd. from Advanced Computer Software Group for
15 million pounds ($23.1 million).  Cedar HR Software, which became part of Advanced in
February 2010, provides duty management software to 30 police
forces in the U.K., had sales of 6.2 million pounds in the 12
months through February, Capita said in a statement. Advanced
Computer Software said in a separate statement it will use the
cash to reduce its net debt.  Cedar is Capita’s third recent acquisition of a company
providing outsourcing services to police authorities after
buying SunGard Public Sector Ltd. last year and Beat Systems
Ltd. this year.  “This acquisition adds both innovation and breadth to our
solutions for police forces,” said Andy Parker, joint chief
operating officer of London-based Capita, whose biggest clients
include Greater Manchester, North Yorkshire and Thames
Valley police.  Capita rose 0.3 percent to 715 pence in London trading as
of 9.11 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
