Telefonica SA (TEF)  Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Cesar Alierta said he sees “spectacular”
growth in  Brazil  and the whole Latin American market, Efe
newswire reported.  Telefonica, which is growing at lower rates in its European
markets compared to  Latin America , isn’t experiencing a further
deterioration in its Spanish market during the second half of
the year compared with the first six months, Alierta said at an
event in Zaragoza, Spain, according to Efe.  The company won’t need to cut jobs again during the next
five years, the newswire said. Alierta reiterated he is
comfortable in the markets where the company already operates
and with the industrial alliances it holds in China and  Italy ,
