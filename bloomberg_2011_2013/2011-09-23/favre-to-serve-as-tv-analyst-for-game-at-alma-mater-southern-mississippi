Brett Favre  will be the color
commentator when the  University of Southern Mississippi , his
alma mater, plays  Rice University  on Oct. 1.  Favre, a three-time National Football League Most Valuable
Player who retired for the third time after last season, will
call the game for CSS, the  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)  regional network said
in a statement.  “I’m not committing to a new career in broadcasting, but
just wanted to support Southern Miss and check out the view from
the press box,” Favre said.  Favre played quarterback at Southern Miss from 1987 to 1990
before entering the NFL, where he started a record 297 straight
games. He was named league MVP from 1995 to 1997 and led the
 Green Bay Packers  to a Super Bowl title after the 1996 season.  The 41-year-old Favre initially retired from the NFL after
the 2007 season and came back in 2008 after a trade to the New
York Jets. He retired again after a year in New York, only to
sign as a free agent with the  Minnesota Vikings  in 2009. He
played two seasons for the Vikings.  Favre also holds NFL career records including touchdown
passes (508), passing yards (71,838) and sacks (525).  To contact the reporter on this story:
