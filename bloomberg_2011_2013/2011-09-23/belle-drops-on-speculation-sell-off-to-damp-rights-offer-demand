Belle Corp. (BEL)  declined in Manila
trading on concern a sell-off in equities will damp investor
demand for the company’s rights offer, according to Peter Lee,
senior investment officer at IGC Securities Inc.  The stock sank as much as 11 percent to 3.5 pesos and
traded at 3.63 pesos at 10:58 a.m. local time. The benchmark
Philippine Stock Exchange Index tumbled 3.9 percent.  The company is offering one share for every six held at 3
pesos a share, according to a prospectus dated Aug. 26. The
offer started yesterday, the stock exchange said.  “There is a probability that some shareholders will not
subscribe to the rights offer because of the negative  market
sentiment ,” Lee said. Vice Chairman Willy Ocier couldn’t be
reached at his office for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
