Zambia’s kwacha declined to its
lowest level in more than a year versus the dollar on concern
 Michael Sata ’s election victory will be followed by higher taxes
on corporations including copper mines.  The kwacha retreated as much as 3.4 percent to 5,160 per
dollar, its weakest level since July 1 last year. It traded at
5,158 per dollar as of 12:20 p.m. in Lusaka.  Sata defeated incumbent President Rupiah Banda with a
promise to create jobs and spread wealth by extracting more
benefits from a rapidly expanding copper industry. The Southern
African country is Africa’s biggest producer of the metal.  Sata’s election manifesto “seems to favor increased
taxation of the corporate sector,”  Leon Myburgh , a
Johannesburg-based analyst at Citigroup Inc., said in e-mailed
comments. “The financial markets are likely to react with some
nervousness and we have already seen the kwacha depreciate.”  Zambia may become the world’s fifth-largest copper-miner by
2013, Sophie Chung, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie’s metals
research unit, Brook Hunt, said in July. Production may more
than double to 1.44 million metric tons by 2015, Brook Hunt
said. Producers including  First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FQM)  and Vale
SA are planning more than $6 billion in investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
