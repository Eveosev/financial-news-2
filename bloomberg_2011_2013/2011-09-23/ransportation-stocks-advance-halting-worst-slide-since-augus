The Dow Jones Transportation
Average rose, rebounding from the biggest five-day decline in
more than a month, as airlines rallied and traders bought the
cheapest shares since 2009.  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  and  United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) 
surged at least 6.3 percent to lead gains as the average rallied
1.7 percent at 4 p.m. New York time.  Con-way Inc. (CNW) , a freight
hauler, advanced 3.5 percent while railroad operator  CSX Corp. (CSX) 
climbed 3.4 percent. The group did better than the  Standard &
Poor’s  500 Index, which added 0.6 percent.  The benchmark gauge for transportation companies had
slipped 11 percent in five days through yesterday, driving its
price-earnings ratio down to a 26-month low of 18.7. The period
marked the worst slump since early August when Standard & Poor’s
stripped the U.S. of its AAA rating and policy makers struggled
to reach a compromise on raising the nation’s debt ceiling,
sending the  S&P 500  to its 2011 low.  While the gains in trucking, airline and courier shares
exceeded the S&P 500, the transportation index is still down 9.6
percent since Sept. 15, spurred by concern the U.S. is poised
for a recession and the European debt crisis will grow.
Transportation stocks, which are considered barometers for the
economy, entered a  bear market  last month, losing more than 20
percent since the 2011 high.  “When you look at where it is, despite today’s move, the
broader trend is still somewhat weak,” Kevin Caron, a market
strategist in Florham Park, New Jersey, at Stifel Nicolaus &
Co., said in a telephone interview. His firm has more than $115
billion in client assets. “The economy is off and slow and
there’s been a haircut to equity values because of that.”  Equity declines have brought the S&P 500’s valuation down
to 12.4 times reported earnings, near the lowest point since
March 2009. The valuation for the transportation index has
fallen from 25.4 times earnings in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
