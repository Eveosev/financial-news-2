Canadian natural gas fell as mild
U.S. weather reduced demand from power plants.  Chicago will have showers and highs of 63 degrees
Fahrenheit (17 Celsius) Sept. 26, 8 degrees lower than normal,
according to AccuWeather Inc. Heavy rain will pare temperatures
across the U.S. East through early next week, the  State College ,
Pennsylvania-based forecaster said.  “We’re looking at a couple of weeks of moderate
temperatures,” said  Kyle Cooper , director of research for IAF
Advisors in Houston. “There’s plenty of gas and not much
demand.”  Alberta  gas for October delivery fell 1 cent to C$3.46 per
gigajoule ($3.19 per million Btu) as of 12:35 p.m. New York
time, according to  NGX,  a Canadian Internet market. Gas traded
on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada  and the U.S. and
is priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.  Gas for October delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose 1.9 cents to $3.724 per million Btu.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.9 billion cubic
feet, 72 million above target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.74 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.03 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 1.29 billion cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.47 billion cubic feet today, about 53
percent of its capacity of 2.76 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.96
