Spain ’s producer-price inflation
rate slowed in August on cheaper commodity prices including
metals and energy after accelerating to a four-month high in
July.  Prices of goods leaving Spain’s factories, mines and
refineries rose 7.1 percent from a year earlier, compared with a
revised 7.5 percent a month earlier, the  National Statistics
Institute  in  Madrid  said today. Prices fell 0.3 percent from
July.  Crude-oil prices have declined by 29 percent from a peak on
April 29, though they remain up 7 percent from a year ago. Spain
is more sensitive to changes in the cost of oil than other euro-
area countries and inflation should fall below the euro-region
average early next year, Bank of Spain Governor Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez said on May 23.  Spanish inflation slowed in August to the lowest rate in
nine months. Consumer prices rose 2.7 percent from a year
earlier down from 3 percent in July as the highest  unemployment
rate  in  Europe  reined in spending.  The statistics institute originally reported annual
producer price inflation of 7.4 percent in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
