Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , the world’s
largest online retailer, won a federal appeals court ruling that
patent claims brought by software maker Cordance Corp. related
to one-click shopping and customer feedback procedures were not
valid, reversing a decision by a trial judge.  The ruling today from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit in  Washington  reinstated a verdict by a federal
jury in  Delaware . The jury found that while elements of a
Cordance patent had been infringed by Amazon, the claims were
invalid. The trial judge later reversed the finding on
infringement, leading to Amazon’s appeal.  “The district court erred” in ruling that the Cordance
claims were valid, the three-judge appeals court panel wrote
today. The claims were anticipated, making them invalid, the
court said.  Cordance had initially sought more than $84 million in
damages for infringement of three patents that are related to
allowing customers to store payment information and shipping
addresses in their Amazon customer accounts. The jury only found
infringement for one of the three contested patents.  Michael A. Albert, an attorney with Boston-based Wolf
Greenfield who represented Cordance, declined to immediately
comment.  Cordance, a patent holder and software developer, sued
Seattle-based Amazon in 2006, contending it was misusing
technology patented by Cordance for one-click shopping and
customer feedback procedures.  The case is Cordance Corp. v. Amazon.com Inc., 10-1502,
1545,  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Federal Circuit
(Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
