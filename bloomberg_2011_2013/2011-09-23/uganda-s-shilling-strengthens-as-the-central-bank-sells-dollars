Uganda’s shilling strengthened the
most in a week as the central bank sold U.S. dollars after the
local currency depreciated to an 18-year low.  The currency of  East Africa ’s third-biggest economy
appreciated 0.9 percent to 2,860 against the dollar at 12:39
p.m. in the capital, Kampala, after plunging to the weakest
level since June 1993 yesterday. The shilling pared its weekly
slump to 2.7 percent.  “We are already in the market; we have intervened in a
significant way,” Paddy Turyamwijuka, the deputy director for
financial markets said by phone Kampala, declining to provide
the amount in line with the central bank policy. The shilling
had retreated because some banks bought the dollar to “cover
their short positions” and oil importers sought the U.S.
currency to purchase supplies, he said.  The dollar rose to a seven-month high against a six-
currency basket yesterday as investors sought haven investments
after the U.S. central bank said on Sept. 21 there are
“significant downside risks” to the outlook.  A surge in food and fuel prices pushed inflation to a more
than 18-year high of 21.4 percent in August from 18.8 percent in
July, the  Uganda  Bureau of Statistics said on Aug. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
