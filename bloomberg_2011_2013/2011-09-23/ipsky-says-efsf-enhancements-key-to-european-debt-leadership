European leaders’ ability to tackle
the debt crisis will be boosted once euro-region nations approve
enhancements to the region’s rescue fund, said  John Lipsky , the
International Monetary Fund’s former no. 2 official and now a
special adviser to the IMF chief.  Lipsky was referring to the European Financial Stability

radio with Ken Prewitt and  Tom Keene .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
