The decline of emerging-market
currencies against the dollar is also eroding support for the
euro because it’s curbing demand from sovereign wealth funds for
an alternative to the greenback, Societe Generale SA said.  “With heavy outflows to be expected out of  Asia  and
emerging markets, the demand to diversify out of the dollar into
the euro as well as new reserve currencies such as the Canadian
dollar dried up,” foreign-exchange strategists led by Kit Juckes in  London  wrote in an investor report yesterday.  The euro fell 0.2 percent to $1.3437 at 1:04 p.m. in
London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
