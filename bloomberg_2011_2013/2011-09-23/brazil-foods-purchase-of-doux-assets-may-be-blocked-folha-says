BRF - Brasil Foods SA (BRFS3)  may be
prevented from buying pork assets in the Brazilian state of  Rio
Grande  do Sul from Doux Frangosul SA by the countryâ€™s antitrust
regulator, Folha de S. Paulo reported, without saying where it
obtained the information.  Officials at the regulator, known as Cade, judge that the
deal under negotiation could result in Brasil Foods owning an
unfairly large segment of the pork market, according to the
newspaper.  Brasil Foods declined to comment, Folha said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
