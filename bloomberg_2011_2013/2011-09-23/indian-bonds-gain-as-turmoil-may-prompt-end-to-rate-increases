India’s 10-year bonds completed the
biggest weekly gain in almost two months on speculation the
central bank will refrain from raising  interest rates  further
amid panic in global financial markets.  Reserve Bank  of India Deputy Governor Subir Gokarn said
yesterday the central bank is near to ending its tightening
cycle. Inflation is likely to ease because “ oil prices  do not
appear to be going higher” and domestic growth is decelerating,
Gokarn said in an interview in  New York . Yields on the 10-year
notes dropped to the lowest level in almost two weeks.  “Growth and inflation are expected to slow,” said  Anoop Verma , a fixed-income trader at Development Credit Bank in
Mumbai. “The outlook for bonds is good in the medium term.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent securities due April 2021 fell
six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, this week to 8.30
percent as of the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the
central bank’s trading system. It was the biggest decline since
the five-day period ended Aug. 5.  India ’s central bank lifted its repurchase rate last week
to a three-year high of 8.25 percent, the sixth increase of
2011, after a government report showed wholesale prices gained
9.78 percent in August, the most in more than a year.  Group of 20 finance chiefs pledged to address rising risks
to the global economy as concern the world is headed for another
recession intensified.  Governments and central banks are “committed to a strong
and coordinated international response to address the renewed
challenges facing the global economy,” the G-20 policy makers
said in a statement released after talks in  Washington .  India’s gross domestic product increased 7.7 percent last
quarter from a year earlier, the smallest gain since 2009, a
government report showed on Aug. 30.  “There’s no clarity about the global recovery,” Verma
said. “That may influence India at some point and help halt
rate increases.”  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
fell 11 basis points this week to 7.85 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
