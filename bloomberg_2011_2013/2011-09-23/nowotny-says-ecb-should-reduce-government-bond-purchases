European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said the ECB should reduce
government-bond purchases.  “The ECB has clear rules which allow it to purchase a
limited amount of  government bonds ” to help markets function
better, Nowotny told reporters in  Washington  today. “However,
it has to be said the Securities Markets Program is not a
permanent mechanism and in my view the volume of bond purchases
should be reduced.”  Nowotny also said the ECB never pre-commits on the future
path of interest rates. “We do take into account what is needed
for the economy,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
