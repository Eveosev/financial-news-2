A measure of banks’ reluctance to
lend to one another in  Europe  rose for a third day to the
highest since March 2009.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the three-
month euro interbank offered rate and overnight index swaps,
climbed to 89 basis points as of 5:10 p.m. in London, from 85
yesterday, Bloomberg data show.  “We are hard pressed to suggest what might snap the market
out of its pessimism,” Roger Francis, an analyst at Mizuho
International Plc in London, wrote in a note.  The cost of converting euro payments into dollars, measured
by the one-year cross-currency basis swap, was little changed at
75 basis points less than Euribor, the biggest gap since
December 2008, Bloomberg data show.  The three-month cross-currency basis swap was 105 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate, compared with 106
basis points yesterday. The cost was 112.5 basis points under
Euribor on Sept. 12, when the swap was the most expensive since
December 2008.  The ECB said financial institutions increased overnight
deposits. Banks parked 136.5 billion euros ($184 billion) with
the Frankfurt-based lender yesterday, compared with 121.4
billion euros on Sept. 21 and 197.8 billion euros on Sept. 12,
the ECB said.  Euribor Rises  Three-month Euribor -- the rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in euros -- rose to 1.537 percent from 1.536
percent yesterday. One-week Euribor increased to 1.18 percent
from 1.17 percent.  The  London  interbank offered rate, or Libor, for three-
month dollar loans rose for an eleventh day, climbing to 0.360
percent from 0.358 percent, according to data from the British
Bankers’ Association. That’s the highest rate since Aug. 16,
2010.  The TED spread, or the difference between what lenders and
the U.S. government pay to borrow for three months, was little
changed at 36.5 basis points, the highest since July 2010,
Bloomberg data show.  The cost of insuring against default on European bank debt
plunged, with the Markit iTraxx Financial Index of credit-
default swaps on the senior debt of 25 banks and insurers
dropping 20 basis points to 282, according to JPMorgan Chase &
Co. An index on subordinated index was down 15 basis points at
525.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporters on this story:
