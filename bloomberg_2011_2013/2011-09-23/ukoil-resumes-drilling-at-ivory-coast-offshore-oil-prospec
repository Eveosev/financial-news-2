OAO Lukoil, the Russian  oil company 
with the most overseas assets, resumed drilling at an offshore
prospect in the Ivory Coast after declaring force majeure
earlier this year.  Drilling started last week and will be completed by the end
of the year, Grigorii Volchek, a spokesman for Lukoil Overseas
Ltd., the companyâ€™s international arm, said by e-mail today.  Lukoil suspended operations in the Ivory Coast in April
after the West African nation was rocked by election-related
violence. The producer had previously announced plans to drill
as many as 10 exploration deepwater wells off Ivory Coast and
Ghana by 2013.  Force majeure is a legal clause that allows companies to
miss scheduled shipments because of circumstances beyond their
control.  To contact the reporter on this story:
