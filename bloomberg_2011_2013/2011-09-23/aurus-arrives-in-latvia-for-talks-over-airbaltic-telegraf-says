Andrey Rudeshko, a representative
of Taurus Asset Manangement Fund Ltd., arrived in  Riga  yesterday
for talks with the Latvian government in a dispute over the
future of airline AirBaltic AS,  Telegraf  reported today.  Taurus owns 50 percent in Baltic Aviation Systems, a
minority holder of AirBaltic, the Russian-language newspaper
said. Rudeshko, who is also a partner at FinEkspertiza, arrived
in  Latvia  after the government demanded to know who the ultimate
beneficial owners of BAS were, Telegraf said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
