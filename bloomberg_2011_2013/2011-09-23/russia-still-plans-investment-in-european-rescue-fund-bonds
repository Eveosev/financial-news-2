Russia  still plans to invest in
bonds issued by the European Financial Stability Facility and is
looking for the rescue fund to become more of an institution,
Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak said.  “We haven’t changed our mind,” Storchak told reporters
yesterday in Washington. “It’s a simple question of basic
administration.”  European leaders are considering expanding the role of the
440 billion euro ($593 billion) fund to help stem the region’s
sovereign debt crisis. Russia, whose international currency and
gold reserves were valued at $545 billion as of Sept. 1, said in
February that it would prepare technical changes so that it
could invest in EFSF bonds.  “The minister’s position is that we’ll use this
instrument,” Storchak said. “They need to get on their feet,
really turn into some kind of institution.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
