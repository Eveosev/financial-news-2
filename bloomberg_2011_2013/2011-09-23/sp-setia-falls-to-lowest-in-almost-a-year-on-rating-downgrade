SP Setia Bhd. (SPSB)  fell to its lowest in
almost one year in Kuala Lumpur trading after  Malaysia ’s biggest
property developer was downgraded at RHB Capital Bhd. on
weakening sales and “lofty” valuations.  The stock slid 2 percent to 3 ringgit at 9:04 a.m. local
time, set for its lowest close since Sept. 30, 2010. Its rating
was cut to “underperform” from “market perform,” RHB said in
a report today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
