Collins Stewart  Hawkpoint Plc, the
U.K. stockbroker, said profit may be lower as earnings from its
securities arm has been hurt by volatile stock markets.  The company’s securities unit is unlikely to recoup the
effect “of recent poor trading” in the current financial year,
it said in a statement today. Its wealth management and
Hawkpoint units continue to perform well, London-based Collins
Stewart said.  “Despite recent losses in that business, overall the group
has traded profitably year to date, but behind the same period
last year,” it said in the statement.  Collins Stewart advises clients on share sales and mergers
and executes trades on behalf of institutional and private
clients. The firm acquired independent advisory business
Hawkpoint in 2006.  To contact the reporters on this story:
