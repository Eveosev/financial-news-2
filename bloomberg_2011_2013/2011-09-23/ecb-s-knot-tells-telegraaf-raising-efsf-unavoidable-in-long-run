European Central Bank Governing
Council member Klaas Knot said raising the European Financial
Stability Facility is “unavoidable” in the long run and may be
followed by joint euro bonds, Ducth newspaper  De Telegraaf 
reported today, citing an interview.  We have to adress the budget problems structurally first,
Knot was cited as saying by De Telegraaf.  Governments will have to refinance existing Greek debt, but
the question is whether you have to do that with new debt too,
Knot also said, according to De Telegraaf.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
