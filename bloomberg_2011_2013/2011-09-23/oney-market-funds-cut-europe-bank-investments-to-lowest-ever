Money-market funds in the U.S. cut
short-term holdings of European bank debt last month to the
lowest levels ever recorded by  Fitch Ratings .  Investments in certificates of deposits, commercial paper
and other short-term debt issued by European lenders declined to
42.1 percent of the funds’ holdings in August from 47.2 percent
a month earlier, according to a Fitch report. That’s the lowest
since Fitch started compiling the survey in 2006.  “Market pressure on short-term liquidity is in general a
concern, but it has to be considered in the context of each
bank’s broader current funding and liquidity dynamics,” Fitch
analysts including Robert Grossman said in the report.  Investments by money-market funds in French banks on a
dollar basis declined 19 percent in August, while holdings of
U.K. bank debt fell 14 percent, according to the report.  Funds increased their exposure to German banks by 8
percent, and by 4 percent in Nordic banks.  The report is based on public filings released by
 money market funds  that oversee $676 billion of assets,
about 45 percent of the total held by money-market funds in the
U.S.  To contact the reporters on this story:
