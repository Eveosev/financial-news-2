Federal, state and local police
began conducting thousands of surprise bus inspections today
before a national meeting on making motor coaches safer.  There have been at least seven fatal bus crashes and 27
deaths this year, including a March accident in the Bronx,  New
York , that killed 15 people returning from a Connecticut casino.  After a May 31 crash in  Virginia  that killed four,
Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood vowed that U.S. inspectors
would use “every legal and enforcement tool available to shut
down unsafe bus companies.”  Roadside inspections have almost doubled since 2005, to
25,703 last year, according to the department. The number of
annual company safety audits more than doubled to 1,042 over the
same period, the department said in a statement today.  Today’s meeting in Washington will enable company
executives and regulators to share ideas on how to reduce
crashes, LaHood said in the statement.  “This summit is about preventing needless tragedies and
saving lives,” LaHood said. “We’ve seen the horrific
consequences when motor coach companies do not make safety a top
priority.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
