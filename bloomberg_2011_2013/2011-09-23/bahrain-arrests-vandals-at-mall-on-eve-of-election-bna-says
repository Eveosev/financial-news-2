Bahraini security forces have
arrested several “vandals” at the biggest shopping mall in the
capital, Manama, the state-run Bahrain News Agency reported.  The incident came a day before Bahrain holds special
Parliamentary elections to fill 18 seats vacated by the al-Wefaq
group, the biggest Shiite Muslim party. Its lawmakers quit to
protest a crackdown on mostly Shiite protesters who held
demonstrations in February and March. At least 35 people were
killed in clashes with security forces.  The protests in Bahrain were demanding full democratic
representation and equal economic opportunities for the majority
Shiite population. The country’s hereditary Sunni rulers invited
troops from neighboring  Saudi Arabia  and other Gulf monarchies
to help restore order, and accused  Iran  of fomenting the unrest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
