fell for a third day after reports that Chinese refineries are
slowing runs.  Murban, produced by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., for loading

its official selling price, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The price earlier this month reached 63 cents over
its official level, the most since May. Qatar Land slipped 5
cents to a premium of 27 cents a barrel, Bloomberg data showed.  Chinese refinery utilization has slipped to the lowest this
year as units shut for maintenance. The crude-processing rate

capacity in the two weeks ended yesterday, Shandong-based
Oilchem.net reported today on its website, citing its survey of
35 plants with a capacity of about 7.3 million barrels a day, or
71 percent of the nation’s total.  China ’s refiners are limited in the profits they can make
on their fuel production because the government fixes retail
prices. The country’s processors had a combined loss of 4.8
billion yuan ($751 million) in July, the National Development
and Reform Commission said in a statement on its website today.  Chinese oil refineries made a profit of 2.4 billion yuan in
