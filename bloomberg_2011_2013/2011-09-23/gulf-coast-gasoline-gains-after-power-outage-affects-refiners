Gulf Coast gasoline strengthened as
 Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  and  Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO)  return units at  Texas
City , Texas, refineries to normal operations following a power
failure.  Valero’s 245,000-barrel-a-day refinery and Marathon’s
81,500-barrel-a-day plant were affected by a faulty transformer
at about 8:30 p.m. local time yesterday, according to Texas-New
Mexico Power Co.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 1.75 cents to 3.75 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 11:28
a.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
rose 4.61 cents to $2.5511 a gallon.  Kevin Fuller, a spokesman for Texas-New Mexico Power, said
the utility is supplying power to the Texas City refineries
through another line while the transformer, a 138-kilovolt unit
used in metering, is repaired today.  In Pennsylvania,  ConocoPhillips (COP)  resumed “routine”
operations at its Trainer refinery,  Rich Johnson , a company
spokesman, said in an e-mail. The 190,000-barrel-a-day plant was
operating at reduced rates yesterday after a unit was shut
because of a crude oil leak.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane fuel in New York
Harbor slipped 0.12 cent to 0.88 cent a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
