Teachers in Cyprus elementary and
secondary schools will strike on Sept. 27 to protest a second
government austerity package, a teachers’ union official said.  “We will strike because we, as teachers, have already
contributed our due share aimed at helping tackle the crisis
with the first fiscal consolidation package, so now it is the
turn of the privileged ones to do the same,” Eleftheria
Theodorou, deputy secretary at high school teachers union
 OELMEK , which counts 6,000 members said in an interview in
Nicosia today. “Now we are asked to consent to a decrease in
wages for new teachers, the cut in child’s benefits and to give
up the wage indexation of the first half of 2012 for a two year-
period.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
