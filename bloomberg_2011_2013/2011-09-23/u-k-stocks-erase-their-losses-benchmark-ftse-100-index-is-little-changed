U.K. stocks pared losses as a rally
in bank shares offset a decline in mining companies.  The FTSE 100 Index rose 0.1 percent to 5,046.65 at 3:52
p.m. in  London  after falling as much as 2.3 percent earlier. The
gauge has swung between gains and losses more than five times
today.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc and Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc limited losses on the FTSE 100, climbing 3.4 percent and 3
percent respectively. Kazakhmys Plc and Xstrata Plc both fell
more than 2 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
