Ethanol futures fell in Chicago on
concern the economy may relapse into recession, cutting demand
for fuels.  Futures fell for a fourth week, the longest such loss since
the week ended April 2, 2010, after the  Federal Reserve  warned
of “significant downside risks” to economic growth.  “You’ve got outside markets overwhelming everything right
now,” said Will Babler, a broker at First Capitol Risk
Management in Galena,  Illinois . “Everyone’s trying to find the
exits at once.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery fell 3.6 cents, or
1.4 percent, to $2.52 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the lowest price since May 13. Futures fell 4.7 percent this
week.  In cash market trading ethanol in  New York  slipped 7.5
cents, or 2.8 percent, to $2.65 a gallon and on the West Coast
prices fell 7.5 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $2.73, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  Chicago  dropped 6.5 cents, or 2.5 percent, to
$2.555 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the additive decreased 6
cents, or 2.3 percent, to $2.575.  On a spot basis, an average ethanol mill in  Iowa  was making
12 cents on every gallon of the fuel, while a typical plant in
Illinois was banking 15 cents as of Sept. 15, according to Ag
TraderTalk, a Clive, Iowa-based online grains information
service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
