Russia’s government approved a
treaty with  Switzerland  that will allow the authorities to
obtain some information about money deposited by Russian
nationals in the Alpine country’s banks, Economy Minister Elvira Nabiullina told reporters in Moscow today.  The accord between the two countries may be signed by the
end of this week, Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said Sept. 21.
The treaty will allow law-enforcement agencies to request Swiss
assistance in tracking down account information about Russian
deposit holders suspected of  tax evasion  or money laundering,
Kudrin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
