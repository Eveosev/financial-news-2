The rate at which London-based
banks say they can borrow for three months in dollars increased
for the eleventh straight day, reaching the highest level since
August 2010.  The  London  interbank offered rate, or Libor, for dollar
loans rose to 0.36022 percent from 0.35806 percent yesterday,
according to data from the British Bankers’ Association. That’s
the highest rate since Aug. 16, 2010.  The dollar Libor-OIS spread, a gauge of banks’ reluctance
to lend, was at 27.32 basis points as of 11:45 a.m. in London,
up from 27.06 basis points yesterday. The spread reached 28.95
basis points on Sept. 19, the widest on a closing-price basis
since July 27, 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The TED spread, or the difference between what lenders and
the U.S. government pay to borrow for three months, rose the
most in more than a week. It widened to 36.02 basis points from
35.80 basis points yesterday. That’s the most since July 20,
2010, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
