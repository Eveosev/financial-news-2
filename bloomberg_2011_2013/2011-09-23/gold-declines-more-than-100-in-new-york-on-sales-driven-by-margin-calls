Gold fell, capping the biggest two-
day plunge since 1983, on investor sales following routs in
global equity and commodity markets.  More than $3.4 trillion has been erased from equity values
this week, sending a global measure of shares into a  bear
market , on concern that governments are running out of tools to
avert a recession. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24
commodities fell to a nine-month low today. Gold has dropped 15
percent since reaching a record $1,923.70 an ounce on Sept. 6.  “Gold has become the source of liquidity for global margin
calls,” said Michael A. Gayed, the chief investment strategist
at Pension Partners LLC. “Also, deflationary pressures are
acting on gold.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell $101.90, or 5.9
percent, to settle at $1,639.80 at 1:51 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , the biggest decline since March 2008. In two days, the
metal dropped 9.3 percent, the most since February 1983. The
weekly decline of 9.6 percent also was the most since that year.  “It’s difficult to say at what level this liquidation will
stop,”  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading in Chicago,
said in a telephone interview. “Slowing growth has created
pressure on gold and commodities from the deflation angle.”  “We are seeing a flight to cash because 2008 is still very
fresh in people’s minds,” Marshall Berol, a co-portfolio
manager of the Encompass Fund in  San Francisco , said in a
telephone interview.  In October 2008, gold prices tumbled 18 percent as the
most-severe slump since the Great Depression spurred losses in
global equity and commodity markets. The metal jumped 23 percent
in the next two months.  “We view the correction in gold as being temporary and
similar to initial losses suffered in 2008,”  Suki Cooper , an
analyst at  Barclays Capital  in New York, said in a report.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery dropped $97.40, or 5.7 percent, to $1,613.20 an
ounce. Palladium futures for December delivery fell $21.55, or
3.2 percent, to $642.50 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
