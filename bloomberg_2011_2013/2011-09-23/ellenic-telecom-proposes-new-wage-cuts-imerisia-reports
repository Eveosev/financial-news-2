Hellenic Telecommunications
Organization SA (HTO) , known as OTE, amended proposals to cut company
payroll costs as it tried to reach a collective wage agreement
with labor unions,  Imerisa  said, without citing anyone.  The company is now seeking a 35-hour working week, compared
with 40 hours, in return for a 12.2 percent pay cut this year,
an 11.1 percent reduction from today’s wage level in 2012 and
another similar 10 percent cut in 2013, the Athens-based
newspaper said.  The measures would mean savings of 204 million euros
($276.1 million) over the next three years, instead of the
original target of 300 million euros; management is keen to
avoid confrontation with unions at a time when it’s losing
subscribers on a daily basis, Imerisia said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
