Turkish two-year yields had their
biggest three-day increase in almost two years and stocks erased
this week’s gains as investors retreated from riskier assets on
concern the global economy is on the brink of another recession.  Yields on two-year benchmark Turkish bonds rose 14 basis
points, or 0.14 percentage point, to 8.64 percent at the 5 p.m.
close in Istanbul, extending their three-day jump to 61 basis
points, the most since October 2009, according to a Royal Bank
of Scotland index of the securities.  Turkey ’s “benchmark bond is really ugly,” Henza Tukel, a
trader at Turk Ekonomi Bankasi AS, the lender owned by BNP
Paribas SA, said by instant message. Local investors are
“selling the benchmark aggressively.”  Bonds and stocks rallied earlier this week, sending the
benchmark yield to a one-week low of 8.03 percent, after
 Standard & Poor’s  upgraded Turkey’s local currency debt to
investment grade on Sept. 20.  That level was “too optimistic” given investor concern
about the global economy and the selloff in markets worldwide,
Arda Kocaman, head of treasury at Finans Invest in Istanbul,
said by instant message in response to questions. Kocaman
predicted the yield may rise to 9 percent, the highest since
July 13, the last time the yield closed above that level.  The  ISE National 100 Index (XU100)  of stocks dropped 2.9 percent to
56,323.38 today, leaving the gauge down 2.7 percent this week.
Turkish lira fell 0.1 percent to 1.8478 per dollar, extending an
all-time record low.  More than $3.4 trillion has been erased from the value of
global equities this week, prompting a pledge by the Group of 20
nations to tackle rising risks.  “Country risk premium is increasing,” said TEB’s Tukel.
