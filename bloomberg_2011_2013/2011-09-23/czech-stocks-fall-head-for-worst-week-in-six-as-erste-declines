Czech shares fell to the lowest
since April 2009, led by  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) , amid concern the
global economy is on the brink of another recession.  The PX stock gauge fell 3.6 percent to 864.1 at its 4:28
p.m. close in  Prague . It had its worst week in six, losing 9.1
percent. Austria’s Erste, with a 16 percent weighting in the
index, today slid 8.1 percent to 408.1 koruna.  Commodities tumbled and European stocks dropped as much as
2.7 percent as policy makers failed to allay investor concern
that the region’s debt crisis is spreading and the economy is
weakening. In Prague, New World Resources Plc slumped 5.4
percent to 127 koruna after JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut its price
estimate for the Czech coal producer by 44 percent, citing
reduced earning forecasts.  CEZ AS (CEZ) , the biggest Czech power utility, fell 3.7 percent
to 679 koruna, a 30-month low. Power for next-year delivery in
neighboring  Germany , where CEZ exports part of its output, this
week slid 2.4 percent to 56.50 euros per megawatt-hour, heading
for its biggest retreat since Aug. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
