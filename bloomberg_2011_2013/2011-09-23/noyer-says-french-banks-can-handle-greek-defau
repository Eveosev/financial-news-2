France â€™s banks are able to handle a
default by  Greece  on its sovereign debt, French central bank
governor  Christian Noyer  said tonight.  Speaking to reporters after a meeting of policy makers from
the Group of 20 nations in  Washington , Noyer said French banks
can write off 100 percent of their exposure to Greek debt, and
that there is no need for new stress tests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
