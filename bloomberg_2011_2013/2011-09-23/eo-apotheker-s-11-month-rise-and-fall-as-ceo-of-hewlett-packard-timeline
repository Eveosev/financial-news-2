Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  ousted Chief
Executive Officer Leo Apotheker yesterday, tapping director and
former EBay Inc. CEO  Meg Whitman  to replace him. Before Sept.
21, when Bloomberg reported that he might be fired, the
company’s stock had plunged 47 percent on his watch. The
following timeline chronicles Apotheker’s tenure.  Feb. 7, 2010: Apotheker resigns from SAP AG after 10 months as
CEO. He presided over SAP’s first annual revenue decline since
2003 as customers, hit by the recession, delayed software
purchases. During his time as CEO, SAP slashed more than 3,000
jobs, its first major cuts since the company was created.  Aug. 6, 2010: Hewlett-Packard CEO Mark Hurd resigns after an
investigation found he had a personal relationship with a
contractor who received numerous inappropriate payments from the
company. Chief Financial Officer Cathie Lesjak takes over as
interim CEO.  Aug. 9, 2010: Oracle CEO  Larry Ellison  says “the HP board just
made the worst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple
board fired  Steve Jobs ,” by forcing out Hurd, Ellison’s friend.  Sept. 6, 2010: Oracle Corp. hires Hurd as a president and board
member, reporting to Ellison.  Sept. 7, 2010: Hewlett-Packard sues to block Hurd from working
at Oracle, saying the appointment may cause Hewlett-Packard to
lose customers,  trade secrets  and its competitive advantage.  Sept. 20, 2010: Hewlett-Packard and Oracle say they resolved
litigation over Hurd’s job at Oracle.  Sept. 30, 2010: Hewlett-Packard names Apotheker president and
CEO. It also appoints Ray Lane, a managing partner at Kleiner
Perkins Caufield & Byers, as chairman.  Oct. 1, 2010: Ellison tells the Wall Street Journal that “HP
had several good internal candidates...but instead they pick a
guy who was recently fired because he did such a bad job of
running SAP.” He adds, “The HP board needs to resign en
masse...right away. The madness must stop.”  Jan. 5, 2011: Hewlett-Packard Chief Marketing Officer Michael
Mendenhall resigns, replaced by  Bill Wohl , a vice president for
communications at SAP.  Jan. 20, 2011: Hewlett-Packard announces a board shakeup in the
wake of criticism over the way it handled Hurd’s departure. Four
directors leave, and Whitman is among five new members named.
Whitman joins the board after a failed bid to become
 California ’s governor.  Feb. 9, 2011: Hewlett-Packard unveils the TouchPad tablet
computer, which runs the WebOS software it acquired in its
purchase of Palm Inc. in 2010 for $1.2 billion.  Feb. 22, 2011: Hewlett-Packard lowers its 2011 revenue forecast
to $130 billion to $131.5 billion, the first of three reductions
under Apotheker. The company also misses analysts’ estimates
with its second-quarter sales and profit projections. Shares
plunge the most in more than six years when markets open the
next day.  March 9, 2011: Apotheker says he will put WebOS software in
every PC shipped by Hewlett-Packard. He also plans to use
acquisitions to expand in software and will reverse Hurd’s
emphasis on cost-cutting. “HP has lost its soul,” he says.  March 14, 2011: Apotheker raises Hewlett-Packard’s dividend for
the first time since 1998, increasing it 50 percent to 12 cents
a share. The company also announces plans to introduce a cloud-
computing service.  March 22, 2011: Oracle says it will stop all software
development on  Intel Corp .’s Itanium chip, a product Hewlett-
Packard uses in its servers. Oracle gained a rival chip called
Sparc through its 2010 purchase of Sun Microsystems Inc.  March 23, 2011: Hewlett-Packard, the biggest producer of servers
that use Itanium, says Oracle’s plan to drop support for the
chip is a “shameless gambit” that jeopardizes customers and
will cost hundreds of millions of dollars in lost productivity.  April 18, 2011: Hewlett-Packard says Thomas Hogan, executive
vice president for enterprise business sales and marketing, has
decided to leave. Jan Zadak will assume that role on May 1, the
company says.  May 17, 2011: Hewlett-Packard cuts its fiscal 2011 sales
forecast for the second time on Apotheker’s watch, to a range of
$129 billion to $130 billion. The company also forecasts full-
year earnings excluding some items that missed analysts’
estimates as consumers shun PCs and services margins narrow.  May 20, 2011: Hewlett-Packard Senior Vice President Marius Haas
is departing for private-equity firm KKR & Co., two people
familiar with the matter say.  June 1, 2011:  Leo Apotheker  says Hewlett-Packard will consider
licensing the WebOS software to other device manufacturers.  June 8, 2011: Hewlett-Packard sends a letter to Oracle demanding
that the software maker keep supporting Intel’s Itanium chip.  June 15, 2011: Hewlett-Packard sues Oracle, claiming that Oracle
has moved from partner to “bitter antagonist.” The suit cites
Oracle’s hiring of Hurd last year, and the announcement that it
would no longer support its  database software  on Hewlett-Packard
servers that use the Itanium chip.  June 29, 2011: Oracle asks a California judge to reject an
effort by Hewlett-Packard to seal court filings in the lawsuit
over Hurd and the Itanium chip.  July 11, 2011: Apotheker reorganizes the PC unit as part of a
push to broaden use of the WebOS software gained in its Palm
acquisition.  Jon Rubinstein , Palm’s former CEO, is put in charge
of product development for PCs, tablets and smartphones. Senior
Vice President Stephen DeWitt is tapped to lead a new unit
devoted to expanding use of WebOS.  July 21, 2011: Hewlett-Packard says it will buy back $10 billion
of its stock to buoy its languishing shares. Before the
announcement, the shares had dropped 14 percent in 2011.  Aug. 18, 2011: In a sweeping overhaul, Hewlett-Packard agrees to
buy software maker Autonomy Corp. for $10.3 billion and says it
is considering a spinoff of its PC unit. The company also
discontinues products running WebOS. Apotheker trims the fiscal
2011 sales forecast for the third time, to a range of $127.2
billion to $127.6 billion.  Aug. 30, 2011: Oracle accuses Hewlett-Packard of fraud and
libel, saying a settlement agreement between the two companies
over Oracle’s hiring of Hurd was unfair. Oracle also claims
Hewlett-Packard defamed the company by saying it bullies
customers.  Sept. 9, 2011: Dominique Senequier, a director with ties to
Apotheker, will leave the board in March, Hewlett-Packard says
in a regulatory filing.  Sept. 22, 2011: Hewlett-Packard names Whitman as CEO, and
Chairman  Ray Lane  becomes executive chairman. During her decade
as CEO at EBay, she took the company public and pioneered e-
commerce for small businesses. Yet in the final years of her
tenure, she couldn’t halt a slowdown in sales growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
