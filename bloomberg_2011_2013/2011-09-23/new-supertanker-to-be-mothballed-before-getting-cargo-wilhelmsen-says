A shipowner will mothball a newly
built tanker for the first time since the 1980s as a glut of the
ships erodes earnings.  The aframax tanker, capable of carrying about 600,000
barrels of crude, will be sent to a natural harbor in  Malaysia ,
Carl Schou, Kuala Lumpur-based president of Wilhelmsen Ship
Management, which will oversee the deactivation, said by phone
and e-mail. He declined to identify the ship because the details
are private.  The last time new tankers were delivered straight from
shipyards to anchorages, a process known in the industry as lay
up, was in the 1980s, with owners sending the vessels to fjords
in Norway, Eleusis Bay in  Greece  and the waters off Malaysia and
 Sri Lanka , Hong Kong-based Charles de Trenck at Transport
Trackers, an adviser on shipping and trade flows, said by e-
mail.  The particular kind of mothballing for this ship is called
warm lay-up, which normally removes vessels from trading for
between three and four months, Schou said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
