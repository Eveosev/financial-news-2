Italian Agriculture Minister
Saverio Romano, who is under investigation in Sicily for mafia
association, said the government may fall if Parliament approves
a no-confidence motion against him next week.  Should the Chamber of Deputies pass the non-binding motion
on Sept. 28, the government’s majority “would change,” Romano
told reporters on the sidelines of a news conference in  Rome 
today. Still, a lower-house vote against him “seems impossible
to me,” he said. Romano denies the allegations against him.  The vote will be another test for Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi ’s thin majority after Parliament rejected a request
yesterday to authorize the arrest of a former aide to Finance
Minister  Giulio Tremonti . In a show of unity amid  Europe ’s debt
crisis, the 630-seat lower house voted 312 to 306 against the
arrest of Marco Milanese, a ruling-party lawmaker accused of
corruption who denies wrongdoing.  Seven members of the ruling coalition defied the premier
and voted with the opposition in the secret ballot, according to
news agency Ansa. The  Northern League , Berlusconi’s ruling ally,
will vote “against the mafia and the no-confidence motion”
brought by the opposition, Romano said, adding that “nobody in
the majority has asked me to resign.”  In an e-mailed statement after yesterday’s vote, Berlusconi
expressed his full “admiration and confidence” in Romano,
whose government work “is greatly appreciated by those working
in the key sector of agriculture.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
