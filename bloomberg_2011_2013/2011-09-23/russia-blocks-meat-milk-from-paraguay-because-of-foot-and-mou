Russia banned meat and milk imports
from  Paraguay  after the discovery of foot-and-mouth disease
there.  The ban started Sept. 21, Russiaâ€™s food safety service
Rosselkhoznadzor said on its website. Paraguay reported the
outbreak on Sept. 18, leading  Brazil  and  Argentina  to suspend
beef imports from landlocked Paraguay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
