The Republican-led  House of
Representatives  should “stop playing politics” over a stopgap
spending bill containing federal disaster aid that’s needed to
keep the government open past Sept. 30, White House press
secretary  Jay Carney  said.  “This should be particularly simple,” Carney told
reporters in a White House briefing.  The House early this morning passed a bill with $3.65
billion in disaster aid that made no move toward compromise with
a separate measure in the Democratic-controlled Senate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
