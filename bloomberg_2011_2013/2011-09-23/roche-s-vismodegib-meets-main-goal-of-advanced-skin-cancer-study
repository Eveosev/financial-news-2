Roche Holding AG (ROG) ’s experimental
vismodegib treatment helped patients with a form of skin cancer
known as advanced basal cell carcinoma, according to a study
presented today at the European Multidisciplinary Cancer
Congress in  Stockholm .  The drug shrunk tumors and healed lesions in patients whose
cancer had progressed too far to be removed with surgery, Roche
said in a statement Sept. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
