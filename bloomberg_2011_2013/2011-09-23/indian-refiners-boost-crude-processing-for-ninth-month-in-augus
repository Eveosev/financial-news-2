Indian Oil Corp. and Hindustan
Petroleum Corp. led refiners in boosting the country’s crude
processing for the ninth straight month in August.  Refiners turned 14 million metric tons of crude into fuels,
3.9 percent higher than a year earlier, the oil ministry said in
a statement in  New Delhi  today.  Processing by state-owned Indian Oil, the nation’s largest
refiner, rose 0.8 percent to 4.3 million tons after its plant at
Haldia in West Bengal state increased production by 28 percent.
Hindustan Petroleum, based in Mumbai, raised output 19 percent
to 1.4 million tons.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , operator of the world’s biggest
refining complex, processed 3 million tons, a decrease of 0.9
percent. Smaller rival  Essar Oil Ltd. (ESOIL)  raised output 3.9 percent.
Reliance didn’t provide data for its newer, 29 million ton-a-
year refinery, according to the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
