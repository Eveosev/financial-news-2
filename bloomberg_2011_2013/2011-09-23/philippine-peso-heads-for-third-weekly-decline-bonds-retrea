The Philippine peso completed a
third weekly loss and bonds fell on concern foreign investors
are selling the nation’s assets as  Europe ’s worsening debt
crisis threatens to derail the global economic recovery.  The currency gained today, reversing an earlier loss, after
finance chiefs from the Group of 20 nations said they were
“committed to a strong and coordinated international response to
address the renewed challenges facing the global economy,” in a
statement issued late yesterday in  Washington .  “People are lightening positions in emerging markets due
to uncertainties in the global economy,” said Antonio Espedido,
treasurer at China Banking Corp. in Manila. “Until such time
that the market is convinced that Europe has stabilized and U.S.
policies will boost growth, the market will flock to the dollar
and U.S. Treasuries as a safe haven.”  The peso dropped 0.7 percent this week to 43.588 per dollar
as of the 4 p.m. close in  Manila , according to Tullett Prebon
Plc. The currency gained 0.4 percent today after falling as much
as 0.4 percent to 43.95, the weakest level since March 17.  The yield on the 5.875 percent government bonds due January
2018 rose 32 basis points, or 0.32 percentage point, this week
to 5.45 percent, according to Tradition Financial Services. The
rate gained 25 basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
