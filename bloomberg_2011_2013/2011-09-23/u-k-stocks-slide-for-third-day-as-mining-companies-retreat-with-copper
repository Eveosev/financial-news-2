in the final hour of trading, as a rally in banks helped the
benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  to rebound from the biggest selloff in
2 1/2 years.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  and  Barclays Plc (BARC)  jumped more than
5 percent amid speculation central banks and governments may

eight times today. The FTSE All-Share Index rose 0.3 percent and
Ireland’s ISEQ Index increased 1.6 percent.  “The FTSE 100 has steadily recovered this afternoon to end
back above the 5,000 mark,” said  David Jones , chief market
strategist at IG Index in  London . “Banks led the charge, whilst
mining stocks remained among the biggest losers. Investors
continue to give them a wide berth on the prospect of further
drops in global demand for commodities.”  The FTSE 100 jumped 1.3 percent at the open after Group of
20 finance chiefs pledged to address rising risks to the global
economy and pushed Europe to contain its sovereign debt crisis.

the  Bank of England  may instigate another round of so-called
quantitative easing within the next two months amid “strains in
the banking system and the intensifying sovereign debt crisis.”  Separately, analysts at RBS wrote that “increasingly
nervous wholesale funding and equity markets may trigger short-
term French government action to support its banks.” RBS said
the most likely option is a capital injection. BNP Paribas SA
and Societe Generale SA climbed more than 8 percent in Paris
trading today.  Mining Companies Fall  Mining companies limited gains after copper dropped to the
