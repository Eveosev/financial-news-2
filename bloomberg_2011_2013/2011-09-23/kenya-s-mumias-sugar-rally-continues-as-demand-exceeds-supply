Mumias Sugar Co.,  Kenya ’s biggest
producer of the commodity, gained for a fourth day as demand in
Kenya and in neighbouring nations continues to outstrip supply.  The stock climbed as much as 4.6 percent to 6.85 shillings
before trading 3.8 percent higher at 6.80 shillings as of 1:49
p.m. in the capital, the longest winning streak since July 20.  “To a large extent there is a deficit in Kenya and the
region, while there is a lot of demand which has pushed up
prices,” Wycliffe Masinde, an analyst at Nairobi-based Kestrel
Capital East Africa Ltd., said in a phone interview today.
“Sugar prices are also high internationally”.  Output of sugar in Kenya, east  Africa ’s biggest economy,
grew to 35,884 tons in July from 33,495 tons a year earlier, the
Nairobi-based Kenya National Bureau of Statistics said in an e-
mailed statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
