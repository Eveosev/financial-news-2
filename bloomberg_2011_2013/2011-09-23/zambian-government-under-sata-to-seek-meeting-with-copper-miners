Zambia’s government under the
Patriotic Front, whose leader  Michael Sata  won this week’s
presidential election, will seek a meeting with mining companies
to seek ways to “earn” more money from copper, said Miles
Sampa, a newly-elected lawmaker and spokesman for Sata.  “We will soon meet the mining company owners to discuss how
we can collect more money correctly from the mines,” Sampa said
in a phone interview from the capital, Lusaka, today. “We want
to reduce poverty as a priority and money from the mines will
help us achieve our plan.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
