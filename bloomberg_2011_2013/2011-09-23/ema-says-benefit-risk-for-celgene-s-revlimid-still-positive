The benefits of  Celgene Corp. (CELG) ’s
Revlimid drug for an incurable blood cancer outweigh the risks
that the treatment may be linked to other kinds of cancers, the
EU’s drug regulator said.  Revlimid was reviewed after three studies showed a higher

said in a website statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
