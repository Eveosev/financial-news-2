slumped 11 percent to 3.50 pesos, the biggest loss since

damp demand for the company’s rights offer, according to Peter
Lee, senior investment officer at IGC Securities Inc. The
company is offering one share for every six held at 3 pesos
apiece, according to an Aug. 26 prospectus. The offer started
yesterday, the stock exchange said.  “There is a probability that some shareholders will not
subscribe to the rights offer because of the negative  market
sentiment ,” Lee said. Vice Chairman Willy Ocier couldn’t be
reached at his office for comment.  San Miguel Corp. (SMC)  , the largest Philippine food and
drinks manufacturer, sank 5 percent to 115.90 pesos, the

Corp. unit this year, according to Astro del Castillo, managing
director at Manila-based First Grade Finance Inc.  San Miguel 
President Ramon Ang said SMC Global Power will proceed with the
share sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
