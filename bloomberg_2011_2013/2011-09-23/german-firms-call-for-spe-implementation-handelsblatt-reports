Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG (HDD)  and
 Siemens AG (SIE)  are among 39 German companies that have called for
the German government to implement the European Private Company,
or SPE, legal model,  Handelsblatt  reported today, citing a
letter sent by the companies to the German parliament.  The SPE form will save companies money when they establish
subsidiaries in other European Union countries by creating EU-
wide regulation to replace the different legal models for
companies in the different states, the German newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
