Finance chiefs from the Group of 20
nations showed a heightened sense of urgency with a warning of a
spillover effect from  Europe â€™s sovereign debt crisis, a U.S.
Treasury official said.  The ministers were in agreement and are committed to
getting European Financial Stability Facility approvals in the
next few weeks, the Treasury official said. The official, who
briefed reporters on condition of not being further identified,
said the G-20 meeting in  Washington  today showed a determination
to act while it did not specifically discuss the Greek rescue
plan.  The comments came after the ministers met for a working
dinner. The U.S. official said those attending had a focus on
moving with speed and urgency and Europeans laid out a clear
path to do so.  To contact the reporters on this story:
