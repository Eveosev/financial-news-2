The ruble slid 0.4 percent to
37.2066 against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket, as
of 10:05 a.m. in Moscow. That is 5.66 kopeks weaker than the
upper limit of Bank Rossii’s so-called floating corridor, which
spanned 32.15 to 37.15 rubles, VTB Group analysts wrote in an e-
mailed research note today, indicating that the regulator may
have altered the corridor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
