Transelec SA, a Santiago-based
electricity transmission company, raised $81 million through a
private placement of Chilean inflation-linked bonds.  The bonds, due in 2032, are denominated in unidades de
fomento, the countryâ€™s inflation-linked accounting unit. The
company plans to use the funds raised for new projects and other
corporate purposes, it said today in a statement to the
securities regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
