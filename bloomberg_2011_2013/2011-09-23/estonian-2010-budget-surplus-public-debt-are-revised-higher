Estonia’s statistics office revised
higher last year’s budget surplus and public debt as a
percentage of gross domestic product, citing recalculated  tax
revenue  and revised GDP data.  The general government budget surplus was 0.2 percent of
GDP in 2010, up from a preliminary estimate of 0.1 percent
published in March, the Tallinn-based office said on its website
today. Gross debt in the Baltic state, which adopted the euro in
January, reached 6.7 percent of GDP, compared with earlier
estimate of 6.6 percent, it added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
