Recapitalizing 16 European banks
which came close to failing stress tests won’t ease the
financial crisis because the banks are small and the market’s
attention is on larger French lenders,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
analysts said.  The banks that didn’t achieve a core Tier-1 capital ratio
of at least 6 percent under the European Banking Authority’s
tests are “individually small,” and they weren’t examined for
their entire investments in sovereign debt, which is now the
market’s concern, the analysts led by Jernej Omahen in  London 
wrote in a note to clients today.  European Union officials may speed up the recapitalization
of the 16 banks, the Financial Times reported yesterday. The EBA
is pushing banks to raise more and better capital to meet the
Basel III guidelines and boost investor confidence in the
industry amid the sovereign debt crisis.  “The current bank crisis is a symptom of markets’
skepticism in sustainability of European public finances; to
this, recaps do not provide an answer,” the note said.  The 16 banks include Banco Comercial Portugues SA, Espirito
Santo Financial Group SA,  Germany ’s HSH Nordbank AG and
Norddeutsche Landesbank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
