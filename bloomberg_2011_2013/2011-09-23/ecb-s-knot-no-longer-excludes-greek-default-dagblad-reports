European Central Bank Governing
Council member Klaas Knot said he no longer excludes a Greek
default, Het Financieele Dagblad reported, citing an interview.  “It is one of the scenarios. I’m not saying that  Greece 
will not default,” Knot said, according to the English
transcript of the interview provided by the newspaper. “I’ve
long been convinced that bankruptcy is not necessary. The news
from  Athens , however, is not encouraging” and “I am now less
definite in excluding a default bankruptcy than I was a few
months ago,” Knot was cited as saying by Dagblad.  Knot said he wondered “whether the Greeks realize how
serious the situation is,” Dagblad reported. “There is doubt
about the quality of the public sector and if the politicians
have enough grip on the country,” Knot said, according to the
Dagblad transcript of the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
