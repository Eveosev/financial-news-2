U.K. mortgage approvals rose to
their highest level in 15 months in August as property investors
bolstered demand, the British Bankers’ Association said.  Lenders granted 35,226 loans to buy homes, up from a
revised 33,734 in July, the London-based lobby group said in an
e-mailed statement today. From a year earlier, mortgage
approvals were up 14 percent.  While falling consumer confidence and the biggest squeeze
on Britons’ spending power since the 1970s is undermining
housing demand, prices are being supported by a lack of property
supply and record low borrowing costs. The  Bank of England  kept
its key  interest rate  at a record low this month and officials
have said it was “increasingly probable” they may need to buy
more bonds to bolster a faltering recovery.  “Banks’ new mortgage lending has ticked up in the past
couple of months with higher buy-to-let demand,”  David Dooks ,
director of statistics at the BBA, said in the report. Still,
the “weak economic environment continues to undermine
confidence in both household and business sectors.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
