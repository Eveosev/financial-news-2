The  Bank of England  will expand its
bond-purchase program and buy an extra 50 billion pounds over
three months from November, according to UBS AG.  “The MPC’s September meeting minutes paved the way for
another round of asset purchases or quantitative easing,” UBS
economist Amit Kara said in an e-mailed note to clients today.
“Our view is that there could be a shift in vote at the October
meeting towards more QE, but the tipping point is only likely to
emerge in November when the Inflation Report is published.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
