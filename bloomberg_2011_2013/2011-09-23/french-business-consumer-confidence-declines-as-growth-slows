French business and  consumer
confidence  fell in September amid concern that slowing global
growth and  Europe ’s debt crisis will crimp demand.  Confidence among factory executives fell to 99 from 102 in
August, national statistics office Insee said today. Consumer
confidence fell to 80 from 82 in August, which was also reported
today. Economists expected a reading of 100 for business and 83
for consumer confidence, according to the median forecasts in
Bloomberg News surveys.  The  International Monetary Fund  lowered its forecast for
the global expansion this week and predicted “severe”
repercussions if Europe fails to contain its debt crisis. The
French government cut its 2011 economic-growth forecast last
month, forcing President  Nicolas Sarkozy  to increase taxes and
raise spending to meet the nation’s deficit target.  “This is about the global slowdown and financing concerns
related to the euro for business and about the impact of fiscal
tightening on consumers,” said  Dominique Barbet , an economist
at BNP Paribas in Paris.  The IMF cut its euro-area growth forecast to 1.6 percent
from 2 percent this year and to 1.1 percent from 1.7 percent
next year. Its forecasts for  France  were reduced to 1.7 percent
in 2011 and 1.4 percent in 2012.  Sarkozy’s government announced 12 billion euros ($16.4
billion) of tax increases and spending cuts on Aug. 24 after
speculation mounted that France’s top credit rating was
threatened by the euro-area debt crisis. The government cut its
growth forecasts to 1.75 percent both this year and next.  To contact the reporter on this story:
