Turkish central bank Governor Erdem
Basci said the net impact of his policies is disinflationary and
the bank will “easily” meet its price-growth goal for next
year.  Basci targets 5 percent inflation for the end of 2012,
according to a statement made to the  International Monetary Fund 
and distributed by e-mail from the Ankara-based bank.  The IMF yesterday urged the central bank to tighten policy
to restore the credibility of its inflation targets. Consumer
price growth in August was 6.7 percent, compared with a target
for the end of this year of 5.5 percent.  The current-account deficit has shown a “significant
improvement” since July as long-term foreign direct investment
and external funding increase, Basci said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
