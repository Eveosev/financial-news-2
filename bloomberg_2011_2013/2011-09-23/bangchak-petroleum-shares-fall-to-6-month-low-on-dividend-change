Bangchak Petroleum Pcl (BCP) , a Thai
state-controlled refiner, fell to a six-month low in Bangkok
trading after the company reduced the proportion of profit it
will pay as a guaranteed dividend.  The shares slid 4.2 percent to 18.20 baht as of 10:07 a.m.
local time, set for the lowest close since March 15.  Bangchak changed its policy on minimum dividend payments,
reducing the level to 30 percent of net income from 50 percent,
it said in a regulatory filing. The adjustment is to “provide
sufficient cash” for future investments amid the unstable
economic environment, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
