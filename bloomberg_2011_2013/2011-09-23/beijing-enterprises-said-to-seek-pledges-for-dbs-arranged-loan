Beijing Enterprises Group Co. is
seeking bank commitments of HK$300 million to HK$400 million for
a HK$1 billion loan after hiring DBS Bank Ltd. to arrange the
facility, according to two people familiar with the matter.  The company is offering to pay an all-in fee of 275 basis
points more than the  Hong Kong  interbank offered rate, one of
the people said, asking not to be identified as details are
private. Proceeds of the three-year club loan will be used for
the acquisition of a toll road related asset.  Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for  Beijing Enterprises
Holdings Ltd. (392) , a unit of Beijing Enterprises Group, Louise Chen,
said on Sept. 20 that the group was borrowing in Hong Kong to
take advantage of lower  interest rates . She declined to comment
on the details of the financing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
