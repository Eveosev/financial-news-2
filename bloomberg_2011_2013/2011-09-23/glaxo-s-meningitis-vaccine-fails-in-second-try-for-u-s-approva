GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  said it failed
in its second attempt to win U.S. approval for MenHibrix, an
experimental combination meningitis vaccine.  The  Food and Drug Administration  notified Glaxo that it
needs more information before it can approve the drug, the
London-based drugmaker said today in a statement. The company
received its first so-called complete response letter on the
vaccine in June 2010.  Glaxo “will work to respond to the questions posed by the
FDA,” the company said in the statement.  MenHibrix is designed to prevent two types of meningitis in
infants and toddlers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
