Rodopa Exportacao de Alimentos &
Logistica Ltda ., a privately held Brazilian beef producer,
postponed a bond sale amid mounting concerns over the economic
situation in  Europe , Chief Executive Officer Sergio Longo said.  “We had it all set,” Longo said today in an interview
from the company’s headquarters in Barueri, Brazil. “But this
is not the moment to sell bonds. I don’t see the situation in
Europe improving in the short term.”  Rodopa, maker of Tatuibi meat products, said Feb. 7 it
planned to sell as much as $100 million in five-year dollar
bonds as early as this year. The company aimed to test the  bond
market  before considering a future Initial Public Offering.  Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa index entered a  bear market  on
July 27. It dropped 20 percent from a bull-market peak in
November. The index has fallen 23 percent this year.  Rodopa planned to use proceeds of the bond sale for working
capital and to refinance net debt of 46.4 million reais ($24.9
million). The postponement won’t affect the company’s financial
needs as it is reducing slaughtering, Longo said.  “We are focusing on efficiency and financial return amid
the market slump,” he said.  The company owns four beef plants in Brazil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
