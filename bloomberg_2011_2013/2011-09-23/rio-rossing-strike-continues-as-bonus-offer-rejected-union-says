Rio Tinto  Group, the world’s
second-largest mining company, said workers at its Rossing
uranium mine in  Namibia  started a strike today after rejecting a
proposed settlement amid a bonus dispute.  Workers are striking at the mine main gate after rejecting
an offer of a cash payment of 15,200 Namibian dollars ($1,830)
as well as a fourth-quarter production incentive, the London-
based company said today in an e-mailed statement.  “We showed our members the offer but they rejected the
proposal as too little,” Ismael Kasuto, the Mineworkers Union
of Namibia representative at Rossing, said by mobile phone
today.  Rossing has about 1,600 workers, with the union seeking an
additional 30,000 Namibian dollars on top of the 11,000 Namibian
dollars they have each been paid in bonuses.  Rio Tinto “continues to explore all the possible avenues
to ensure that this issue is resolved amicably to minimize the
impact of protracted industrial action which benefits no one,”
it said.  Rossing ships about 7 percent of global supply, according
to World Nuclear Association data. The mine, 70 kilometers (40
miles) inland from the coastal town of Swakopmund, began
production in 1976. Rio owns 69 percent of the operation and the
government of  Iran  owns a 15 percent stake, according to its
website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
