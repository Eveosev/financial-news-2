The  African Development Bank  will
lend  Kenya  $500 million for infrastructure projects over the
next three years, said Jeremiah Mutonga, the Tunis-based
lenderâ€™s representative in the East African country.  As much as $200 million will be paid next year and the
remainder in 2013 and 2014, Mutonga told reporters today in the
capital, Nairobi.  The bank has 25 ongoing projects in Kenya with a total
value of $1.47 billion, Mutonga said. About 43 percent of the
funds have been spent on roads, 19 percent on water and
sanitation and 14 percent each on energy and agriculture, he
said. Among the projects is a 45-kilometer (31-mile) highway
linking Nairobi with the town of Thika at a cost of $200
million.  The lender has also provided funding for a feasibility
study on a 50-kilometer mass-transit system for Nairobi,
Division Manager for Transport Amadou Oumarou said during the
briefing. The study is expected to be completed in six months,
after which detailed design will begin, Oumarou said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
