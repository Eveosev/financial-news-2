Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-largest
U.S. bank, was sued for fraud by IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG
over a sale of $4.2 million in residential mortgage-backed
securities.  An IKB unit took part in the purchase of million of notes
in a transaction underwritten and sold by New York-based
Citigroup, according to court papers filed yesterday in  New York 
State Supreme Court in Manhattan.  IKB, based in Dusseldorf, accused Citigroup of fraud,
negligent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment and breach of
contract in the one-page filing. The German lender asked a judge
to rescind the sale and award unspecified punitive damages.  Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a spokeswoman for Citigroup,
declined to comment on the complaint.  IKB filed a similar complaint against JPMorgan Chase & Co.
earlier this month in the same court over unspecified losses.
IKB, which was bailed out during the subprime mortgage crisis,
was put up for sale by buyout firm  Lone Star Funds . Dallas-based
Lone Star paid about 137 million euros ($185 million) to take
control of IKB in August 2008.  The case is  IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG (IKB)  v. Citigroup
Inc., 652609/2011, Supreme Court of the State of New York,
County of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
