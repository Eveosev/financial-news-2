European Union Monetary Affairs
Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said two dozen of Europe’s banks need to
present plans to recapitalize following stress tests earlier
this year.  “These plans are ongoing,” Rehn said in an interview in
 Washington  with Sara Eisen on Bloomberg Television. They “need
to present remedial plans, which will involve raising funds
either from the private capital markets, or if that is not
possible, together with the member states, to capitalize or
restructure.”  He said there needs to be a “conscientious approach to
ensure that European banks are being recapitalized.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
