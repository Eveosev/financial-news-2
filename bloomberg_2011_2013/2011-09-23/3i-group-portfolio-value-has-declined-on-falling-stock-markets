3i Group Plc (III) , Britain’s biggest
publicly traded private equity firm, said the value of its
assets is likely to drop as stock markets decline and the
economic outlook worsens.  Net asset value at Sept. 30 is likely to be lower than at
March 31 because 3i values its companies at a multiple of
earnings based on publicly traded competitors, the London-based
firm in a statement today. In the five months through Aug. 31,
3i stepped up asset sales, reaping 528 million pounds ($814
million), from 129 million pounds in the same period a year
earlier.  “The economic outlook looks increasingly challenging,”
Chief Executive Officer Michael Queen said in the statement.
“We face this environment with confidence having reshaped the
business over the last few years to ensure that we have both a
strong balance sheet and liquidity to continue to implement our
strategy.”  3i has been seeking to boost profit after the credit crisis
froze dealmaking. Queen, who became CEO in January 2009,
combined 3i’s leveraged-buyout team with its growth capital unit
last year and agreed to buy Mizuho Investment Management U.K.
Ltd. to expand its holdings in corporate debt.  The company said today it will boost its dividend to a
“substantially higher level.” The shares rose 3.6 pence, or
1.9 percent, to 191 pence at 8:03 a.m. in  London .  Investments rose to 303 million pounds in the period, from
257 million pounds the year before, the firm said today. Net
debt dropped to 343 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
