Oil sank below $80 a barrel and
capped the biggest weekly drop since May as a pledge by Group of
20 nations to tackle rising risks failed to ease concern that
the global economy is on the brink of another recession.  Futures fell 0.8 percent in  New York  as losses in silver,
lead, gold and zinc took the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24
commodities to its lowest level since December. Prices trimmed
an intraday decline as equities and the euro rebounded on
speculation global central banks will take coordinated measures
to prevent a financial crisis.  “The last couple of days have been pretty wild and it
looks like a lot of fears about the economy continue to weigh on
the market,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  Crude for November delivery fell 66 cents to $79.85 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the first settlement
below $80 since Aug. 9. Futures decreased 9.2 percent this week,
the first decline in five weeks and the biggest drop since the
five days ended May 6. Prices have fallen 13 percent this year.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
November, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, surged to the highest level in six
weeks yesterday for the contract nearest to expiration.
Volatility slipped to 47.2 percent at 2 p.m. in New York from
48.5 percent yesterday, according to Bloomberg data.  Brent for November delivery fell $1.52, or 1.4 percent, to
$103.97 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe 
exchange.  G-20 Pledge  G-20 finance chiefs pledged to address risks to the global
economy and pushed Europe to contain its sovereign debt crisis.
Policy makers are “committed to a strong and coordinated
international response to address the renewed challenges facing
the global economy,” group finance ministers and central bank
governors said in a statement late yesterday in Washington.  “You’re having a tug-of-war in this $80-type range,” said
 Kyle Cooper , director of research for IAF Advisors in Houston.
“There’s uncertainty regarding the equity markets, regarding
demand, regarding the entire financial system.”  Central bankers and finance ministers were to discuss the
economic outlook today at the annual meetings of the
 International Monetary Fund  and  World Bank  in Washington.  The  European Central Bank  may act to address risks to
growth as soon as next month should economic data disappoint,
Governing Council member Luc Coene said.  Potential measures include the reintroduction of longer-
term bank loans with maturities of 12 months or even longer,
Coene, who heads  Belgium ’s central bank, said in an interview in
Washington late yesterday.  Equities Rise  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.4 percent to
1,133.56 after earlier declining as much as 0.7 percent. The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  gained 1.81 points to 10,735.64. The
benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index increased 0.6 percent to
216.19, recovering from a drop of as much as 2.6 percent.  The euro rose to $1.3487 at 2:43 p.m. in New York from
$1.3465 yesterday, curbing the intraday decline in oil futures.
A stronger euro and weaker dollar boosts the appeal of
commodities as an alternative investment.  The S&P GSCI Index of 24 commodities fell as much as 2.2
percent to 594.12, the lowest level since Dec. 2. The index was
down 1.2 percent at 2:34 p.m.  “A lot of this stuff is self-correcting,” said  Adam Sieminski , chief energy economist at Deutsche Bank AG in
 Washington . “Commodities have now come down quite a bit. Energy
and metal prices are lower and that will put more money in
consumers’ pockets. Eventually you will see this reflected in
the economic data.”  Prices May Fall  Oil prices  may fall next week, according to a Bloomberg
News survey of analysts. Twenty-two of 40 respondents, or 55
percent, forecast oil will decline through Sept. 30, while nine,
or 23 percent, predicted prices will increase. Nine estimated
there will be little change. Last week, 45 percent of the
surveyed analysts projected a drop.  U.S. fuel demand rose last month as the consumption of
distillates, including diesel used by drivers, jumped to a
record for August, according to the  American Petroleum
Institute . Total deliveries of petroleum products, a measure of
demand, increased 0.3 percent to 19.7 million barrels a day last
month from a year earlier, the industry-funded group said in a
report today from Washington.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 713,513
contracts as of 2:35 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 786,485
contracts yesterday, 19 percent above the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.38 million contracts, up from
the nine-month low of 1.36 million the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
