Milling wheat in Paris fell to a
six-week low on speculation that demand for grains from the
European Union and U.S. will decline amid concern about global
economic conditions.  Commodities dropped as much as 2.2 percent today as a
pledge by the Group of 20 nations to tackle rising risk and the
Federal Open Market Committee’s “Operation Twist” to replace
short-term Treasuries with long-term bonds in its portfolio, and
not introduce a third round of so-called quantitative easing,
failed to ease concern that the global economy is on the brink
of another recession.  “Demand worries rattled the market, as the FOMC meeting
did not introduce QE3 and warned the market of negative economic
risks ahead,” Barclays Capital analyst Shiyang Wang said in a
report today. “The agriculture complex tumbled across the board
as the downbeat economic outlook takes its toll on  market
sentiment . ”  Milling wheat for November delivery fell 0.7 percent to
190.75 euros ($258.14) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in Paris by
5:28 p.m. local time, and earlier today fell as much as 3.25
euros, or 1.7 percent, to 188.75 euros, the lowest price since
Aug. 9. The price is down 24 percent this year. Futures declined
this year partly because  Russia  resumed exports of wheat on July
1 after a 10-month shipping ban was lifted.  Egypt said yesterday it purchased 240,000 tons of Russian
wheat, again shunning U.S. and European Union inventories
following a purchase of 420,000 tons on Sept. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
