Mauritius’s rupee declined for a
fourth week versus the dollar as the European sovereign debt
crisis and faltering global growth curbed demand for riskier
emerging and frontier market assets. Stocks declined to an 11-
month low.  The currency depreciated as much as 1 percent and traded
0.5 percent down at 29.10 at 5 p.m. in Port Louis, the capital,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That brings the rupee’s
five-day drop to 1.4 percent, extending the longest weekly
losing streak since May. Versus the euro, currency of its main
trading partner, the rupee strengthened for a second day,
advancing 2.5 percent to 38.6210.  BNP Paribas SA and Societe Generale SA,  France ’s two
largest lenders, are trimming 300 billion euros ($406 billion)
from their balance sheets to free up capital as the debt crisis
deepens in Europe. The  European Central Bank  may act to address
risks to growth as soon as next month should economic data
disappoint, Governing Council member Luc Coene said.  “Sentiment globally has been hit lately, with risky assets
bearing the brunt of risk-off trading,” analysts at Mauritius
Commercial Bank, the country’s largest lender by market value,
said in an e-mailed note to clients today. “Markets are
agonizing about the stalemate in Europe, with the European
banking sector now being at risk.”  Tourism, Textiles  Tourism and textiles are the Indian Ocean island nation’s
main foreign currency earners, with  Europe  as its main market,
according to Bank of Mauritius data, while the dollar accounts

a population of 1.3 million people, is a net importer of fuels
and food.  Mauritian stocks retreated for a second day. The 38-member

 State Bank  of Mauritius Ltd. were among the biggest decliners.  Buying prices for the dollar ranged from 28.0397 to 28.2074
