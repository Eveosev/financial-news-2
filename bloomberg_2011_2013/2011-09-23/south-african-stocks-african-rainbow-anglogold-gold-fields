The FTSE/JSE  Africa  All Share Index
declined for a third day, dropping 261.83, or 0.9 percent, to
30,061.21 at the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg, extending the
week’s loss to 3.2 percent.  The following are among the most active stocks in the South
African market today.  African Rainbow Minerals Ltd. (ARI)  , a producer of coal,
platinum and nickel, slid for a second day, dipping 2.47 rand,
or 1.4 percent, to 179.01 rand. Commodities were set for their

2.85 rand, or 2.2 percent, to 129.15 rand.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  , Africa’s biggest producer
of the metal, had its biggest decline this year, falling 16.40
rand, or 4.4 percent, to 355.10 rand. Gold headed for its worst
weekly performance in more than four months as investors sold
the metal alongside global equities and other commodities on
concern the world economy will falter.  Harmony Gold Mining Co. (HAR SJ), the continent’s third-
largest gold company, declined 5.90 rand, or 5.6 percent, to
99.10 rand.  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)  , the world’s fourth-biggest gold
producer, had its biggest lost since February 2010, falling 8.32
rand, or 6 percent, to 131 rand. Peru’s Congress passed a law
increasing a mining windfall tax by sixfold as the Andean
country seeks to tap metals prices to boost public spending.  MTN Group Ltd. (MTN)  , Africa’s largest mobile-phone
operator, fell to its lowest in more than a month, dropping 1.50
rand, or 1.1 percent, to 130.50 rand. Analysts at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. cut the company’s price estimate to 154 rand.  Sasol Ltd. (SOL)  , the world’s largest producer of motor
fuel from coal, declined for a third day, slipping 7.50 rand, or
