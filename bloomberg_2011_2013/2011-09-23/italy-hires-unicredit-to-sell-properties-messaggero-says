Italy hired  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  to advise
on the sale of 300 military properties as part of a plan to cut
its debt,  Il Messaggero  reported without saying where it
obtained the information.  The Treasury may transfer the assets, which include
barracks and army bases, to a real-estate fund, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
