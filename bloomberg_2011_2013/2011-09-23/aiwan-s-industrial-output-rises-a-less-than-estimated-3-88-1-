Taiwan ’s industrial production rose
less than estimated in August, signaling the island’s economic
expansion is easing as the global recovery falters.  Output advanced 3.88 percent from a year earlier, after
gaining a revised 3.63 percent in July, the  Ministry of Economic
Affairs  said in Taipei today. The median of 12 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a 4.09 percent gain.  Europe’s debt crisis and the  Federal Reserve ’s indication
the  U.S. economy  faces “significant downside risks” have dimmed
the outlook for Taiwan’s exports. A further decline in Taipei
home prices last month from a record earlier this year, and the
slowest export-order growth in August in 22 months, have
weakened the case for another rate increase next week.  “The future growth path will largely depend on how
financial markets will evolve, and whether policy makers in
 Europe  can credibly address sovereign-debt issues to prevent a
global economic downturn,” Ma Tieying, an economist with DBS
Bank Ltd. in  Singapore , said before the release.  Taiwan’s central bank will leave borrowing costs unchanged
at 1.875 percent on Sept. 29, snapping a run of five straight
quarterly increases, she said.  The Taiex stock index tumbled as Asian shares fell, closing
down 3.6 percent before the release. The Taiex has slid 21.5
percent his year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Taiwan Dollar  Slide  The Taiwan dollar declined 0.1 percent to NT$30.388 against
its U.S. counterpart at the 4 p.m. close, according to Taipei
Forex Inc. The local dollar weakened the most in more than 10
years yesterday, dropping 1.4 percent.  Overseas sales account for about two-thirds of the island’s
$355 billion gross domestic product and help to drive factory
output. The economy expanded 5.02 percent in the three months
through June from a year earlier, the slowest pace since a 1.21
percent contraction in the third quarter of 2009.  The central bank, which sets rates once per quarter, raised
borrowing costs on June 30 by 0.125 percentage point.  Output at manufacturers rose 3.83 percent in August from a
year earlier, after climbing a revised 3.4 percent in July,
today’s data showed. Output in the mining and quarrying
industries declined 8.8 percent. Production increased 20.12
percent in the construction sector.  To contact the reporters on this story:
