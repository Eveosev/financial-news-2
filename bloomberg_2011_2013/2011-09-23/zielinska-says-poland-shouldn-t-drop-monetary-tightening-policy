Poland ’s central bank shouldn’t
drop its monetary-tightening strategy because the economy is
still experiencing inflation pressure and may expand at better
than a 3 percent rate next year, avoiding a recession, Anna
Zielinska-Glebocka of the Monetary Policy Council said today in
an interview on TVN CNBC.  She added that price pressure isn’t sufficient “to force
us to increase  interest rates  at the next meeting” of the
Monetary Policy Council in October.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
