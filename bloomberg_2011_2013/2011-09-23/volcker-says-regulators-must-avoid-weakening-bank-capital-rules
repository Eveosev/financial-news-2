Paul Volcker , the former U.S.
Federal Reserve chairman, said global regulators must guard
against the weakening of rules put in place after the 2008
credit crisis that oblige commercial banks to hold more capital.  “The tendency may be to bend toward a least common
denominator, weakening the standards, and to uneven
application,” Volcker said in the text of a lecture he’s giving
today in  Washington . “Resistance to those pressures must be a
priority for regulation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
