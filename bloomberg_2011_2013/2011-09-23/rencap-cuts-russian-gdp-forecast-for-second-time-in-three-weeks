Renaissance Capital  cut its
forecast for Russian economic growth next year for the second
time in three weeks, citing “intensifying concern” over the
global economy.  “Negative U.S. growth” and “meager” increases in
domestic investment and  consumer spending  in 2012 will probably
lead to a 2.3 percent increase in Russian gross domestic product
in 2012,  Ivan Tchakarov , the Moscow-based investment bank’s
chief economist for  Russia , said in a report today.  RenCap last cut its growth forecast for 2012, from 4.4
percent to 3.5 percent, on Sept. 6. The bank also trimmed its
outlook for growth this year to 4 percent from 4.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
