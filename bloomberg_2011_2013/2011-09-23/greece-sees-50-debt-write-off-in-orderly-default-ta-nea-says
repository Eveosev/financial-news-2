Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos told members of the ruling party that he sees three
possible outcomes to the debt crisis, including one that
involves an orderly default with a 50 percent loss for
bondholders,  Ta Nea  said, without citing anyone.  Venizelos outlined “good, bad and better” scenarios to
lawmakers with the “good option” involving the implementation
of the July 21 accord for a second financing package, which
projects a 20 percent loss for bondholders, the Athens-based
newspaper said.  The “bad” scenario is a collapse of the accord and a
disorderly default, Ta Nea said. The “better” one involves an
orderly default in the euro area with Venizelos indicating a 50
percent haircut for investors, the newspaper said. That outcome
isn’t something  Greece  can request and requires the agreement
and coordination of many actors, Ta Nea said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
