The  European Central Bank  may lower
its benchmark interest by 50 basis points when policy makers
meet next month to bolster the euro-region economy, JPMorgan
Chase & Co. said.  The ECB may cut borrowing costs to 1 percent at the Oct. 6
meeting, Greg Fuzesi, an economist at JPMorgan in  London , said
in an e-mailed note. If the central bank lowered its key rate by
25 basis points at that meeting, “we would expect another move
to follow very quickly, at the latest by” December.  The euro-region economy may “slide back into recession,
with gross domestic product declining at a 1 percent annualized
pace” from the fourth quarter of 2011 to the second quarter of
2012, according to the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
