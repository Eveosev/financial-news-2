p.m. in Moscow. That brings the benchmark’s weekly decline to 13
percent. The dollar-denominated RTS Index fell 5.3 percent to
1,314.46.  The following are among the most active stocks in the
Russian market today. Stock symbols are in parenthesis.  OAO Sberbank (SBER03 RX), the country’s largest bank and
the biggest holder of ruble deposits, fell for a third day,
declining 7.6 percent to 68.42 rubles, poised for its weakest
close since May 2010. The ruble weakened 0.4 percent to  32.1850

controlled by the world’s biggest gas exporter, fell 7.6 percent

economy is headed for a recession. OAO Lukoil (LKOH RX),
 Russia ’s biggest private oil company, declined 2.1 percent to
1,564.60 rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
