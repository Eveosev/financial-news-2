Vietnam ’s five-year bonds gained
after the government’s borrowing costs declined at a debt
auction. The dong weakened.  The State Treasury sold 350 billion dong ($16.8 million) of
securities due 2016 at 12.1 percent yesterday, according to the
Hanoi Stock Exchange. It sold similar-maturity notes at 12.14
percent last week. Rates on three-year bonds also slipped to
12.05 percent yesterday from 12.14 percent at the previous sale.  “Bond yields in the secondary market will drop with the
decline of coupon rates at auctions,” said Nguyen Hong Quang, a
Hanoi-based fixed-income dealer at Bank for Agriculture & Rural
Development, the country’s biggest lender.  The yield on five-year  government bonds  fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 12.46 percent, according to
a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong weakened 0.1 percent to 20,834 per dollar as of
2:45 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,628,
unchanged since Aug. 24, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
