Peru ’s central bank will probably
cut its benchmark  interest rate  by a quarter-point in December
as the global economy deteriorates, BNP Paribas said.  Policy makers are likely to vote for a further 25 basis-
point cut in January, taking the benchmark rate to 3.75 percent,
Nader Nazmi, a senior Latin America economist at BNP, wrote in a
report issued today. Monetary conditions haven’t eased as much
in Peru as in other Latin American economies whose currencies
have depreciated more quickly, Nazmi wrote.  The Andean nation’s central bank has kept rates unchanged
at 4.25 percent at its past four meetings. It last lowered rates
in August 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
