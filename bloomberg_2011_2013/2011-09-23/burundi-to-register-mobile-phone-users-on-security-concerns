Burundi asked mobile-phone operators
to register users so security forces can track alleged criminals
whose use phones to “disturb people,” said Catherine Mabobori,
spokeswoman for the first vice presidency.  All mobile-phone subscriber-identification module cards sold
in the East African nation will be registered starting today and
current users need to enrol, including giving pictures, she said
in an interview today in Bujumbura, the capital.  The move is in line with other African countries, Mabobori
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
