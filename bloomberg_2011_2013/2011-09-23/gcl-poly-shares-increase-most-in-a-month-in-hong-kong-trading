GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd (3800) ,
 China ’s largest polysilicon maker, rose the most in a month in
Hong Kong trading after the company said it is cooperating with
Foxconn Group in the solar industry.  The stock jumped as much as 6.9 percent, the biggest
intraday increase since Aug. 23, and was 5.1 percent higher at
HK$2.29 as of 3:12 p.m. on the city’s stock exchange. This
compared with a 1.1 percent decline in the benchmark Hang Seng
Index.  GCL-Poly denied media reports that it is working with
Foxconn to produce solar cells and modules.  “The cooperation with Foxconn Group in other solar areas
is still at a memorandum-of-understanding stage,” it said in a
website statement yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
