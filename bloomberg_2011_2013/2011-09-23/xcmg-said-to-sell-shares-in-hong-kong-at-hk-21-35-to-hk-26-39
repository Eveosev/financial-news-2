XCMG Construction Machinery Co.,
 China ’s biggest crane maker, plans to sell shares in Hong Kong
at HK$21.35 to HK$26.39 apiece ($2.74 to $3.38), said two people
with knowledge of the matter.  The number of shares sold will be about 15 percent of the
total outstanding shares after the sale, people familiar with
the deal said yesterday. They requested anonymity because the
details are private. XCMG shares already trade in Shenzhen.  A person who answered the phone at XCMG’s offices in Xuzhou
City, Jiangsu province, and didn’t reveal his name, declined to
comment on the pricing.  The low end of the  price range  represents a 12 percent
discount to XCMG’s latest closing price of 19.89 yuan, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
