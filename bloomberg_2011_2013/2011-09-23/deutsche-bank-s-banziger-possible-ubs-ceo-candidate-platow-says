Deutsche Bank Chief Risk Officer
Hugo Banziger may be a candidate to replace UBS Chief Executive
Officer  Oswald Gruebel ,  Platow Brief  reported, without saying
where it got the information.  Former Bundesbank President  Axel Weber  might be closely
involved in the decision and may assume his own position at UBS
earlier than planned, Platow added.  UBS plans to nominate Weber to the board of directors on
May 3, 2012. If elected, the board plans to appoint Weber as
vice chairman next year and chairman to succeed Kaspar Villiger
in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
