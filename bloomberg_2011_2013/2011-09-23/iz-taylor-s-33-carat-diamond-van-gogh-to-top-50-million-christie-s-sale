A 33-carat diamond and a  Van Gogh 
painting will be among top lots in auctions that may raise more
than $50 million for the estate of  Elizabeth Taylor .  Christie’s International announced the contents of the  New
York  and London sales yesterday as it put on show some of the
1,000 lots of jewelry, couture and art formerly owned by the
Oscar-winning actress and philanthropist. Taylor died in March,
aged 79. Bloomberg reported in April that a sale was planned.  The star of “Cleopatra,” “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof” and
“Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf” made more than 50 movies and
was married eight times. She was an inveterate collector and
wearer of jewels.  The 33.19-carat emerald-cut diamond was a gift from  Richard Burton , whom she married twice. Burton bought the piece at
Sotheby’s, New York, in May 1968 for $305,000, then an auction
record for such a ring. The stone, worn by Taylor on an almost-
daily basis, will reappear at Christie’s Rockefeller Plaza rooms
priced at $2.5 million to $3 million on Dec. 13. The two-day
sale of Taylor’s jewels is valued at $30 million.  A necklace incorporating a pear-shaped 203-grain pearl
known as “La Peregrina” -- formerly part of the crown jewels
of  Spain  -- was another Burton gift. It is valued at $2 million
to $3 million.  The exhibition runs from today to Sept. 26 at Christie’s in
London. The show, comprising more than 100 pieces, continues on
a world tour to  Los Angeles , Dubai, Geneva, Paris,  Hong Kong  and
New York. Visitors to the London preview will be charged 10
pounds and the boxed five-volume catalog costs $300. A portion
of these proceeds will be donated to the  Elizabeth Taylor Aids
Foundation  (ETAF), the auction house said in an e-mailed
statement.  Landscape Claim  Taylor was the daughter of an  art dealer , who championed
the work of Augustus John in the U.S. He bought Van Gogh’s 1889
landscape “Vue de l’Asile et de la Chapelle de Saint-Remy” for
his daughter for 92,000 pounds at  Sotheby’s (BID)  London in 1963. The
painting subsequently became the subject of a restitution claim
that was rejected by a U.S. appeals court in 2007.  The intensely rendered canvas -- one of 17 artworks in the
preview -- is now valued at 5 million pounds to 7 million
pounds. Christie’s will include Taylor’s most valuable paintings
in its London series of Impressionist and Modern art auctions on
Feb. 7-8, 2012.  Her couture, costume, decorative arts and memorabilia will
be sold in New York on Dec. 14-16. Additional lower-value items,
including costume jewelry, will be offered online at
www.christies.com from Dec. 3-17.  The preview also includes a Chanel ballgown that Taylor
wore to the Royal Film Performance of “The Taming of the
Shrew” and a Tiziani black velvet evening cape the star
commissioned for Princess Grace of Monaco’s 40th birthday
“Scorpio Ball.” These have minimum values of $6,000 and
$2,000.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
