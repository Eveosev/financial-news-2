News Corp. (NWS)  directors will be sued
in the U.S. by victims of phone hacking by reporters at the News
of the World tabloid, a lawyer said.  Legal action will be started in the U.S. within 10 days,
Mark Lewis, a lawyer representing phone-hacking victims in
London, said in an interview broadcast on Sky News today.  The scandal not only led to the closure of the News of the
World, it also forced News Corp. to drop a takeover bid for
 British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc. (BSY)  At least 16 people have been
arrested, among them Andy Coulson, Prime Minister David Cameron’s former communications chief, and an ex-News of the
World editor.  News Corp. (NWSA)  spokeswoman Teri Everett didn’t immediately
respond to a call seeking comment.  Lewis represents phone-hacking victims including the family
of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler. Revelations the paper
accessed Dowler’s mobile-phone messages while she was missing in
2002 escalated the scandal, leading to the resignations of
Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive officer of News
Corp.’s U.K. publishing unit, and  Les Hinton , the head of the
company’s Dow Jones & Co. division.  News Corp. agreed to pay 3 million pounds ($4.6 million) to
the Dowlers and a charity to settle the family’s claims, a
person with knowledge of the matter said this week. News Corp.
Chairman  Rupert Murdoch  was personally involved in the
negotiations, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
