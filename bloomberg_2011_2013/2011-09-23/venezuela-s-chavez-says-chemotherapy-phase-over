Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez 
said he finished chemotherapy last night in Cuba and will now
prepare for a “full recovery.”  “The chemotherapy phase has finished, we can close the
chemotherapy cycle,” Chavez said from Caracas airport in
comments broadcast on state television. “Now, we’re going to
dedicate ourselves to a full recovery, the physical therapy,
exercise, a progressive and full recovery.”  Chavez, standing and wearing a blue and white track suit,
said he will assume his duties at the head of Venezuela’s
government at an “adequate rhythm.” This was Chavez’s fourth
round of chemotherapy for an undisclosed cancer.  The former paratrooper, who had a baseball-sized tumor
removed by doctors in Cuba in June, will rely more on
“technology” to canvass for votes in next year’s presidential
election as his recovery limits his ability to match the intense
campaigning Venezuelans have grown accustomed to in previous
elections. The self-professed socialist completed the first two
rounds of chemotherapy on the island nation before undertaking
the third round in  Venezuela .  To contact the reporter on this story:
