International Monetary Fund
Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  said the  European Central
Bank  is “reluctantly” supporting sovereign borrowers and
should continue being involved after new rules to the region’s
bailout fund are in place.  The Frankfurt-based ECB, which last month started buying
Italian and Spanish government debt, is playing the role of
lender of last resort for governments “reluctantly, with not
great certainty and predictability in the long run, which is
certainty a bit of an issue,” Lagarde said.  The ECB is probably doing it “as a bridge” until new
powers for the European rescue funds are ratified by all member
countries, Lagarde said during a discussion at the Bretton Woods
Committee in  Washington  today.  “I personally wonder whether it would not be necessary to
actually have a combination of both, with obvious backing of the
sovereigns and guarantees on an organized basis,” she said.  She also suggested that the Washington-based IMF could
create new precautionary credit lines for “groups of
countries.”  The Washington-based IMF this week cut its global growth
forecast and predicted “severe” repercussions if  Europe  failed
to contain its debt turmoil. The ECB started purchasing bonds
after investors demanded euro-era record yields while policy
makers grew increasingly divided over the best way to fight the
crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
