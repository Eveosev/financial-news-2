The  European Central Bank  may cut
its benchmark rate by 50 basis points in October, economists at
 Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  wrote in an  e-mailed  note to
clients.  A decision is unlikely to be unanimous, but given the
“speed of financial market deterioration we believe that a
majority will support a large cut,” said the economists who
added that they “now forecast outright recession” for the euro
area.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
