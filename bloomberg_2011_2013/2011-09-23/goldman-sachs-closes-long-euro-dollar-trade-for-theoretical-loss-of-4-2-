Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  said it
exited a bet that the euro will strengthen against the dollar
after the 17-nation currency weakened to below a so-called stop-
loss level that triggered the end of the trade.  The trade was stopped at a “theoretical loss” of 4.2
percent including interest, the New York-based company said in a
note today.  “The recent sharp increase in  risk aversion , much of this
originating in Europe, and upward pressure on the dollar across
a wide range of currencies lately, has pushed the cross below
our 1.35 closing stop,” Goldman said in the note written by
analysts including chief strategist Thomas Stolper.  The euro rose 0.6 percent against the dollar to $1.3551 at
9:42 a.m. in  London . The single European currency has weakened
1.8 percent against the dollar from last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
