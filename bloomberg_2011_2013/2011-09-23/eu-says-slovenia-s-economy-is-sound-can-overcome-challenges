Slovenia has a “sound economy”
capable of overcoming current challenges, the European
Commission said in reaction to a cut in the country’s credit
rating by Moody’s Investors Service.  “We remain very confident in the capacity of the Slovenian
economy to face these challenges in the coming months,”
commission spokesman Olivier Bailly told reporters in Brussels
today.  Bailly declined to comment directly on the Moody’s
downgrade.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
