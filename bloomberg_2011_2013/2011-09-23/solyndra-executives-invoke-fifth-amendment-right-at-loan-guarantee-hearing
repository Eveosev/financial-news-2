Solyndra LLC executives refused to
answer questions from a House energy committee investigating the
solar-panel maker’s $535 million U.S. loan guarantee, which one
Republican described as a half-billion dollar heist.  Chief Executive Officer Brian Harrison and Chief Financial
Officer Bill Stover attended the House Energy and Commerce
Committee’s investigations panel hearing today, flanked by their
attorneys, as lawmakers said they were misled about Solyndra’s
finances during meetings two months ago.  Harrison and Stover responded to questions by invoking
their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination.  To contact the reporter on this story:
