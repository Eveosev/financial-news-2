Supertankers that can carry about
8.6 million barrels a day went to  Saudi Arabia ’s Ras
Tanura, the world’s largest export facility for crude oil, ship-
tracking data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Very large crude carriers with a combined capacity of about
8.2 million deadweight tons were at the terminal from Sept. 11
to Sept. 17. To estimate what that equates to in terms of
barrels a day, the figure was first multiplied by 7.33 to
calculate the total barrels and then divided by seven, the
number of days in the period.  Singapore will get the largest share of shipments loaded
this week. Five supertankers with a combined capacity of about
1.54 million tons, or 11.3 million barrels of crude, are
sailing to the country after loading at  Ras Tanura . China will
also get five VLCCs, with a total capacity of 1.49 million tons,
while another four are sailing to  South Korea , data captured by
satellites and shore-based antennae show.  Following are the ships loading in Saudi Arabia, the
companies that hired them and estimated times of arrival, where
data are available. Drafts are expressed as a percentage of
maximum sailing depth and are an indication of cargo size.  To contact the reporter on this story:
