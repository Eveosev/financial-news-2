mailed statement. ICAP’s monthly average is 0.087 percent.  The central bank will acquire $500 million to $1.25 billion
of Treasuries maturing from November 2021 to August 2041. The
purchases are part of the Fed’s policy to continue to reinvest
the proceeds of maturing assets on its balance sheet to prevent
a tightening of monetary policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
