Russia ’s Micex Index fell, losing
the most over a two-day period since November 2008, as oil slid,
sapping demand for stocks in the world’s biggest energy
exporter.  OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel sank 8.4 percent at the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, while OAO Gazprom Neft, the oil producer
controlled by the country’s gas export monopoly, dropped 5.9
percent. Those movements left the 30-stock Micex Index down 4.5
percent at 1,327.19, bringing its two-day drop to 12 percent.
It’s the index’s worst weekly drop since February 2009. The
dollar-denominated RTS Index fell 5.2 percent, bringing the
weekly loss to 16 percent.  Urals crude, Russia’s chief export earner, lost 9.3 percent
this week, the most since May, to $106.68 a barrel. European and
U.S. policy makers failed this week to reassure investors the
global economy won’t enter recession, pushing emerging-markets
stocks down 16 percent this month, headed for the biggest drop
since October 2008.  Investors are pricing the market as though Urals had fallen
to $70 a barrel, according to  Chris Weafer , the chief strategist
at Troika Dialog in Moscow, Russia’s oldest investment bank.  “Either they are right to be that fearful, or the market
fall is overdone,” he wrote in an e-mailed note today. “It
will take a very brave investor to make that call either way
right now.”  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials fell
for a third day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
