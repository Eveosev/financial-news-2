Blackboard Inc. (BBBB)  sought to make the
loan backing its purchase by Providence Equity Partners Inc.
more attractive to investors as companies increased the discount
on as much as $4.2 billion of buyout loans this week.  Blackboard, an education-software maker, decreased the
price at which it will sell $780 million of debt backing its
buyout by as much as 3 cents to 92 cents on the dollar,
according to a person with knowledge of the transaction. AEA
Investors LLC increased the discount it was offering this week
on a $250 million loan to back its buyout of Garden Ridge Corp.
to 93 cents.  Investors are demanding more yield to buy leveraged loans
as the  Federal Reserve  announced new measures Sept. 21 to spur
growth as the recovery falters. The average discount needed to
sell institutional loans was 97.86 cents on Sept. 15, down from
99.4 cents in the first three months of the year, according to
Standard & Poor’s Leveraged Commentary & Data. That increases
borrowing costs by $15 million for every $1 billion borrowed.  “Issuers are concerned that in this seemingly risky
environment that their deals won’t be well received,” Otis Casey, a New York-based director of credit research at financial
information-services company Markit Group Ltd., said in a
telephone interview. “The secondary market has been weak
through August and that’s been fresh in everyone’s mind.”  The Federal Reserve said Sept. 21 that it saw “significant
downside risks” in the economy and it will replace $400 billion
of short-term debt with longer-term Treasuries to try to
increase growth as the economic recovery slows down.  Go Daddy  The S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan 100 Index, which tracks the 100
largest dollar-denominated first-lien leveraged loans, fell 0.42
cent yesterday to 89.42 cents on the dollar. The index is up
from a low of 59.2 cents on Dec. 17, 2008, three months after
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed. The index fell 5.34
percent in August, the biggest monthly decline since Nov. 2008.  Go Daddy Group Inc., the website registration and hosting
company being acquired by KKR & Co.,  Silver Lake Partners  and
Technology Crossover Ventures, increased the discount on its
$750 million  term loan  to 93 cents from an originally offered 96
cents yesterday. Telx Group Inc., a data center operator being
acquired by Abry Partners LLC and Berkshire Partners LLC, sold a
$255 million term loan with a 94-cent discount, increased from
an originally offered range from 96 cents to 97 cents.  BJ’s Wholesale Club Inc., the third-largest U.S. warehouse-
club chain, also increased the discount it was offering on $2.18
billion of loans backing it’s buyout by Leonard Green & Partners
LLP and  CVC Capital Partners , according to a person with
knowledge of the matter.  Garden Ridge, a retailer of home décor products, increased
the rate this week it will pay on its $250 million buyout loan,
according to a person with knowledge of the deal.  Garden Ridge Loan  The debt will now pay 7.25 percentage points more than the
 London  interbank offered rate compared with the 6.25 percentage
points to 6.5 percentage points initially offered, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the terms are
private. Libor, a rate banks charge to lend to each other, will
have a 1.5 percent floor.  Garden Ridge, based in Houston, is proposing to sell the
loan at 93 cents on the dollar, compared with 97 cents initially
proposed. A larger discount decreases the proceeds for the
company and boosts the yield for investors.  U.S consumer confidence fell last week to the weakest point
since the recession ended in June 2009. The Bloomberg Consumer
Comfort Index fell to minus 52.1 in the period to Sept. 18 from
minus 49.3. The Bloomberg consumer comfort gauge, which began
December 1985, has been stuck below minus 40 -- the level
associated with recessions or their aftermath -- since the end
of February.  Sovereign-Debt Crisis  Concern that the European sovereign-debt crisis will spread
beyond  Greece  sent markets tumbling yesterday as finance
ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20 were set to
meet in  Washington  over the weekend. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index
sank 4.6 percent to 214.89 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London, the
lowest since July 2009.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 3.2 percent yesterday
to 1,129.84 after briefly slipping below its 2011 closing low.
Ten-year Treasury yields fell as low as 1.6961 percent, the
lowest in Federal Reserve figures starting in 1953.  “Loans seem to be a little bit more resilient to what’s
going on compared to other risky assets,” said Markit’s Casey.
“The thing to keep in mind is to see if the loan market can
continue to be this resilient as we’re seeing a strong flight to
safety move.”  Blackboard increased the discount at which it will sell a
$780 million first-lien portion of a financing to back its
buyout by  Providence Equity Partners , according to a person with
knowledge of the transaction.  The company will now sell the loan at 92 cents on the
dollar, compared with the 94 cents to 95 cents initially
proposed, said the person, who declined to be identified because
the terms are private.  The debt will pay 6 percentage points more than the London
interbank offered rate, said the person. Libor, a rate banks
charge to lend to each other, will have a 1.5 percent floor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
