Central and eastern  Europe ’s
economic sentiment indicator plunged to the lowest in more than
2 1/2 years in September as the regional growth outlook dimmed
and the euro area’s debt crisis continued, the  ZEW Center for
European Economic Research  and  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  said.  The index, a measure of investor confidence, dropped 11.6
points to minus 38 points in September, the lowest since January
2009, ZEW and Erste Bank said in an e-mailed statement today.  Europe’s failure to resolve its debt crisis, coupled with
the global economic slowdown, is darkening the outlook in
eastern Europe, much of which relies on exports to fuel growth.
The European Commission last week cut its euro-area growth
forecasts for the second half and warned the economy may come
“close to a standstill at year-end.”  The plunge in confidence was probably caused by
“significantly worsened economic expectations for some
countries” and “rising concerns about eurozone’s economic
prospects,” ZEW and Erste Bank said in the statement.  Hungary  led the drop in economic expectations, with a 31.8-
point fall in its sentiment index to minus 47.5 points, the
lowest among eight countries in the survey. Hungary’s central
bank yesterday cut its 2012 growth forecast to 1 percent in
response to government plans to raise taxes on budget concerns,
from 1.5 percent earlier.  Poland’s index lost 21.6 points and stood at minus 36.8
points while Austria’s dropped by 21.2 points to minus 46.9
points. Romania had the highest index at minus 5.6 points.  The ZEW index reflects the difference between the
percentage of analysts who have positive outlooks and those with
negative views. Ratings range from a maximum of 100 points to a
minimum of minus 100 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
