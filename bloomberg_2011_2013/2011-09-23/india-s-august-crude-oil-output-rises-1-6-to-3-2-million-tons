India ’s crude oil output rose for
the 21st straight month in August as  Oil India Ltd. (OINL)  and non-
state companies including  Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR)  boosted production.  Asia’s second-biggest energy consumer pumped 3.2 million
metric tons of oil last month, a 1.6 percent increase from a
year earlier, the oil ministry said in a statement today.  Production by non-state explorers climbed 7.2 percent to
881,700 tons. Output from Rajasthan state, where Cairn India
operates the country’s biggest onshore oil deposit, rose 1.8
percent to 542,000 tons, according to the data. Cairn India
started the field in August 2009.  Oil India, the second-biggest state-run crude producer,
reported a 4.7 percent increase in output to 330,900 tons,
according to the statement.  Production by state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corp., the
nation’s largest energy explorer, fell 1.1 percent to 2 million
tons, the ministry said. The company’s Mumbai High fields
produced 1.4 million tons, a decline of 2.2 percent. The fields,
100 miles (160 kilometers) northwest of Mumbai in the Arabian
Sea, account for 44 percent of India’s oil production.  Natural gas output in India fell for the ninth straight
month, declining 5.3 percent to 4.1 billion cubic meters,
according to the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
