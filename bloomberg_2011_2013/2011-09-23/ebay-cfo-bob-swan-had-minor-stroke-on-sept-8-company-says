EBay Inc. (EBAY)  Chief Financial Officer
Bob Swan suffered a “minor” stroke on Sept. 8 and will split
time working from home and the office as he recovers, the e-
commerce company said.  Swan was discharged from the hospital within a week of
receiving care, John Pluhowski, a spokesman for EBay, said today
in a statement. The stroke affected his left arm and leg. The
executive remained actively engaged with the company through e-
mail and telephone contact, Pluhowski said.  “Bob quickly experienced partial recovery and expects to
regain full use of his arm and leg,” Pluhowski said.  Swan will continue working in the coming weeks while he
undergoes physical therapy.  EBay, the world’s largest e-commerce marketplace, rose 41
cents to $32.08 today on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Shares of the
 San Jose , California-based company have gained 15 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
