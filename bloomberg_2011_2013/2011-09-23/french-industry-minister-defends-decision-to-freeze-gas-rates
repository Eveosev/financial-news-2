French Industry Minister Eric Besson defended his decision to freeze natural-gas rates for
households after  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA pledged to appeal the ruling.  “Our preoccupation is that GDF guarantees supply and that
this doesn’t weigh on spending power,” Besson said today on
Canal Plus television, referring to  Europe ’s largest gas
company. “We won’t raise gas prices for households on Oct. 1.”  GDF Suez said yesterday a freeze on regulated residential
rates would cost the former gas monopoly 290 million euros ($392
million) in the second half. The Paris-based utility will “take
the appropriate legal action to protect its rights,” it said in
a statement.  The government will raise regulated rates for businesses by
4.9 percent on Oct. 1.  The rate increase for business customers is “marginally
better than our assumption of a full freeze until the
elections,” JPMorgan Cazenove analysts including Nathalie Casali said in a note today.  France  will hold presidential
elections in May.  The bank estimates that household rates should have risen
by 6.9 percent July 1 and 3.2 percent Oct. 1 to pay for supply
costs.  The French government in April froze household gas prices
for a year, a decision the country’s energy regulator ruled
should have been reversed from Oct. 1 to allow GDF Suez to cover
supply costs. A prolonged freeze in prices “isn’t compatible”
with law, the regulator said, citing a 2007 ruling by France’s
highest court, the Conseil d’Etat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
