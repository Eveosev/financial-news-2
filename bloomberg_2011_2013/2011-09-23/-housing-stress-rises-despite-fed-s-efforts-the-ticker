The  Federal Reserve 's efforts to lower  interest rates  are supposed to ease the financial pressure on homeowners by helping them reduce their mortgage payments. Judging from the latest Census data, they're not having much success. As of 2010, some 37.8 percent of households with mortgages were spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing costs -- a level the government considers excessive. That's up from 37.5 percent in 2009 and 34.5 percent in 2005. The increase came despite the fact that the average 30-year mortgage rate fell to 4.69 percent in 2010, from 5.04 percent in 2009 and 5.87 percent in 2005. To some extent, the figures reflect the rising price of gas and other utilities, which are included in the Census measure of housing costs. In 2010, the Labor Department's price index for fuels and utilities stood about 2 percent higher than in 2009, and 20 percent higher than in 2005. The persistent stress in housing, though, also highlights one of the main problems with the Fed's attempts at monetary stimulus: Many borrowers simply can’t take advantage of lower mortgage rates, because their income has fallen, they owe more than their homes are worth, or they shouldn’t have qualified for a mortgage in the first place.
