First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the largest maker
of thin-film solar panels, sank for a seventh day in Nasdaq
trading after losing a $1.9 billion U.S. Energy Department loan
guarantee for a project in  California  that it plans to sell.  The stock fell $2.64 to $64.21 at 10:37 a.m. local time.
That’s the lowest for the Tempe, Arizona-based company since May
2007 and increases the loss in market value to $2.3 billion for
the seven-day drop.  First Solar said it wouldn’t get the guarantee for the
Topaz power-generation project and would continue to seek a
buyer, just two weeks after panel-maker Solyndra LLC filed for
bankruptcy and left U.S. taxpayers responsible for much of its
$535 million guarantee. First Solar still expects to close on
two other loan guarantees before a Sept. 30 deadline.  “People are rapidly exiting cleantech stocks because of
politics,” Paul Clegg, an analyst at Mizuho Securities USA in
 New York , said today in an interview. “Solyndra triggered a
conversation about renewable energy subsidies that raised fears
that other loan guarantees might unravel.”  First Solar currently has conditional commitments for a
$680 million guarantee for a 230-megawatt project and a $1.8
billion guarantee for a 550-megawatt project, according to the
Energy Department’s  website . The company received a $967 million
guarantee for a project in  Arizona  in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
