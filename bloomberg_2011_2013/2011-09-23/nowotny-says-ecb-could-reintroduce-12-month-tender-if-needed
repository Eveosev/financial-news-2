European Central Bank Governing
Council memberEwald Nowotny said the bank could reintroduce 12-
month loans to euro-region banks to ease funding strains.  “There is no immediate liquidity problem for banks but
what we do see is a mismatch where banks have difficulties
refinancing themselves longer term,” Nowotny told reporters in
 Washington  today. “To address this the ECB will probably
discuss reintroducing a 12-month tender. It’s certainly
something that will be discussed in the council.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
