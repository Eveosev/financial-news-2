Hungarian shares fell, extending a
third week of declines, as OTP Bank Nyrt., the country’s biggest
lender, capped its worst weekly loss in 2 1/2 years.  The benchmark BUX index of shares fell 1.4 percent by the 5
p.m. end of trade in Budapest, bringing its loss this week to 11
percent. OTP slumped 6.6 percent to 2,798 forint, bringing its
losses this week to 25 percent, the biggest since the five days
through February 2009.  OTP’s shares, which have a 23 percent weighting in
 Hungary ’s benchmark gauge, have plunged since parliament
approved a plan on Sept. 19 allowing the repayment of mortgages
denominated in Swiss francs, euros and yen at below-market rates
at banks’ costs. European stocks declined to the lowest level
since July 2009 yesterday amid concern the global economic
recovery is stalling.  “The foreign prepayment proposal is also to weigh on the
capital base of banks,” as well as on economic growth, Zoltan Arokszallasi, an economist at Erste Group Bank AG in Budapest,
wrote in a research report today.  Hungary’s 10-year government bonds weakened for a fifth
day, extending the biggest weekly jump in yields in 10 months.
The yield rose 20 basis points, or 0.2 percentage point, to 8.32
percent today, according to generic prices compiled by
Bloomberg. That brings the week’s increase to 73 basis points,
the most since the five days through Nov. 26, 2010.  Hungary’s new Fiscal Council today backed the 2012 budget
draft, while seeing “significant risks” as revenue may miss
targets on slower growth. The three-member Fiscal Council voted
two-to-one to back the proposal, chairman Zsigmond Jarai told
reporters today in Budapest. Central Bank President Andras Simor
voted against the draft, citing lower growth and higher
inflation forecasts, Jarai said.  The forint strengthened 0.8 percent to 289.67 per euro
after  Poland ’s central bank sold foreign currencies today on the
foreign-exchange market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
