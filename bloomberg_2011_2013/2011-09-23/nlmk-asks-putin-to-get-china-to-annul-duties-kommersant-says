OAO Novolipetsk Steel,  Russia â€™s
largest steelmaker by market value, asked Prime Minister
 Vladimir Putin  to persuade China to reverse planned duties on
electrical steel, Kommersant reported, citing a company
document.  Novolipetsk, known as NLMK, sent a letter to the Russian
Economy Ministry asking that a 65 percent tariff on the steel be
raised at the next meeting of the Russia-China intergovernmental
commission chaired by Putin and his Chinese counterpart in mid-
October, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
