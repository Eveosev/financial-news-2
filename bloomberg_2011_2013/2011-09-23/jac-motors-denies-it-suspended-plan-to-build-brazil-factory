 Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group
Co Ltd’s JAC Motors said it hasn’t postponed or canceled its
plan to build a factory in  Brazil , according to the company’s
press office in  Sao Paulo .  The automaker is confident in an agreement over the new tax
rules with government officials, the press office said.    The increase of taxes on cars with less than 65 percent of
local content, announced last week by the government, makes a
new factory in the country “impracticable”, JAC Motors said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
