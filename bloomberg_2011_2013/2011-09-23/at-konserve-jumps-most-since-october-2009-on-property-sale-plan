Tat Konserve Sanayii AS (TATKS) , a Turkish
producer of canned and frozen foods, surged the most almost two
years after saying it signed agreements with two real estate
consultants to sell its 175,000 square meters of property in
Istanbul.  Tat rose 26 kurus, or 9.7 percent, to 2.95 liras at 9:50
a.m. in Istanbul, in the biggest increase since October 2009. A
close at this level would be the highest since Aug. 4, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
