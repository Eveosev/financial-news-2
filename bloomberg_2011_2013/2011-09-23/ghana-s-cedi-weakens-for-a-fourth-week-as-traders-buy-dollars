Ghana ’s cedi depreciated for the
fourth week against the dollar, as traders bought the U.S.
currency to pay for imports of goods for resale in the West
African nation.  The currency of the world’s second biggest cocoa producer
slumped as much as 0.5 percent today and last traded less than
0.1 percent weaker at 1.5728 per dollar as of 1:03 p.m. in
Accra, the capital. That brings the cedi’s drop for the week to
0.6 percent.  “Demand for dollars from the commerce industry was
basically the mover of the market this week,” Biggles Amponsah,
a currency trader at the local unit of Access Bank Plc, said in
a phone interview. “Dollar buying from the traders slowed a bit
yesterday but it picked up again today.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
