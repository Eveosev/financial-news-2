Akfen Holding AS (AKFEN) , a Turkish builder
and energy company, is in talks with as many as four
international banks to help advise on the possible sale of
stakes in airport-management units, said a person with knowledge
of the situation.  The company, which has a 26 percent stake in  TAV
Havalimanlari Holding AS (TAVHL) ,  Turkey ’s biggest airport operator, may
reduce its holding or exit some investments completely, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the plans are
private. Investors may be sought for Akfen’s stakes in a duty-
free shop operator and catering company, the person said.  Proceeds from any sales would be set aside to help compete
in forthcoming government tenders to run roads and a gas grid in
Ankara, the person said. TAV Havalimanlari runs 10 airports
including Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir as well as others in Tunisia,
Macedonia and  Georgia , according to its website.  Akfen Holding Chief Executive Officer Suha Gucsav and TAV
Havalimanlari Holding CEO Sani Sener didn’t answer phone calls
seeking comment.  Akfen shares fell 38 kurus, or 4 percent, to 9.10 liras in
Istanbul trading, the stock’s biggest fall in two weeks. TAV
rose 1.2 percent to 7 liras.  To contact the reporter on this story:
