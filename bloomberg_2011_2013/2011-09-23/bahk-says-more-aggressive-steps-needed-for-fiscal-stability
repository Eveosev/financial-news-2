South Korea’s Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said a “more aggressive, systematic and balanced
approach” is needed to ensure fiscal sustainability in the
global economy.  Large economies should consider how their fiscal and
monetary policy would affect other nations, while emerging
countries must step up efforts to mitigate excessive capital
flows, Bahk said in a statement prepared for the annual meetings
of the  International Monetary Fund  and  World Bank  in Washington.  He also called for more effective financial safety nets and
an expansion of the IMF’s available resources to cope with
crises.  To contact the reporters on this story:
