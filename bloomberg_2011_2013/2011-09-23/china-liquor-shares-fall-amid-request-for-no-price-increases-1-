Kweichow Moutai Co., the world’s
second-largest distiller by market value, and other Chinese
liquor makers fell in  Shanghai  and Shenzhen trading after the
government asked them to stop raising prices.  Shares of Kweichow Moutai fell 3.8 percent to 190.10 yuan
as of 1:54 p.m. in Shanghai, poised for its lowest close since
June 27. Luzhou Laojiao Co. fell 7.1 percent to 38.85 yuan in
Shenzhen, heading for its lowest close since Jan. 10.  Representatives from Kweichow Moutai, Wuliangye Yibin Co.,
Luzhou Laojiao and other distillers got the request not to raise
prices in a Sept. 16 meeting with the National Development and
Reform Commission, the  China  Alcoholic Drinks Industry
Association said Sept. 19 on its website. China is aiming to
control inflation that hit a three-year high in July.  “Considering recent inflation pressure, liquor products
play a special role in stabilizing market consumption even
though they are not staple  consumer goods ,” the drinks industry
association said.  The request was meant to stop the sort of increases that
Wuliangye, China’s largest liquor maker by sales, announced last
month, when it said it would raise prices 20 percent to 30
percent starting Sept. 10. Kweichow Moutai may raise prices
before Oct. 1, the 21st Century Business Herald reported Sept.
16, citing an unidentified person familiar with the situation.  Wuliangye fell 2.6 percent to 36.19 yuan in Shenzhen
trading. Anhui Gujing Distillery Co. also slid 5.2 percent in
Shenzhen to 53.10 yuan.  China’s consumer-price inflation slowed in August to 6.2
percent after reaching 6.5 percent in July, a three-year high.  To contact the reporter on this story:
