S3 Graphics Co., the image-
compression technology company being bought by phonemaker  HTC
Corp. (2498) , filed a complaint against  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  at the U.S.
International Trade Commission.  The content of the complaint filed yesterday wasn’t
immediately made public. The ITC, an arbiter of trade disputes
with the power to block imports of products found to infringe
U.S. patents, posted a  notice  of S3’s filing today.  S3, in a separate ITC case in July, won a partial ruling
against Cupertino, California-based Apple that said the Mac OS X
computer system violates patents. The judge’s decision is under
review by the full commission. Fremont, California-based S3
makes image-compression technology and its Texture Compression
feature is used in Nintendo Co.’s Wii and Sony Corp.’s
PlayStation portable gaming systems.  Taoyuan, Taiwan-based HTC,  Asia ’s second-biggest maker of
smartphones, agreed to buy closely held S3 for $300 million in
July. HTC and Apple have targeted each other in patent-
infringement complaints as part of a struggle among smartphone
makers for market share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
