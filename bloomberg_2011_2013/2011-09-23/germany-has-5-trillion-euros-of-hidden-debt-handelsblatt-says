Germany â€™s public debt is much
higher than officially shown,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing
calculations by Bernd Raffelhueschen, an economics professor at
Freiburg University.  Apart from 2 trillion euros ($2.7 trillion) of public debt,
there are liabilities of another 5 trillion euros because of
shortfalls in the social security and pension funds, according
to Raffelhueschen, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
