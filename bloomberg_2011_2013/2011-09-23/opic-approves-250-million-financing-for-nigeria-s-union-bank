Overseas Private Investment Corp.
today approved $250 million in financing for two companies to
invest in Union Bank Plc, a Nigerian lender bailed out by the
central bank in 2009, the Washington-based U.S. government
finance institution said in a statement.  Keffi Group Ltd. and Discovery Global Citizens Capital
Partners, who will receive the funds, are part of African
Capital Alliance group of investors taking over Union Bank. The
funding will be used to add new products, including mobile
banking, to enable the lender to reach parts of the population
without access to banking services, according to the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
