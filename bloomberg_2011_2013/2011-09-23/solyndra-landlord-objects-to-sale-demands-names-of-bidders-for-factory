Solyndra LLC, the bankrupt solar-
panel maker, shouldn’t be allowed to hold an auction for its
shuttered production facilities until it names the bidders, the
company’s landlord said in court papers.  The landlord, iStar CTL I, LP, asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Mary Walrath to set a deadline for Solyndra to name any bidders
who will try to take over the company’s seven-year, $129,000-a-
month lease.  Under the proposed auction rules, iStar won’t know what a
bidder wants to do with the building Solyndra leases “until
just before the sale hearing,” which doesn’t give iStar enough
time to decide whether it objects to the proposed buyer, the
landlord said in court papers filed today in Wilmington,
 Delaware .  Solyndra doesn’t yet have an initial bidder. The company
said in court earlier this month that it may have two parties
interested in buying and reopening its factory.  The company, whose $535 million federal loan guarantee is
under investigation by Republicans in Congress, filed bankruptcy
this month with a plan to either sell its eight-month-old
factory, or liquidate the specialized equipment used to
manufacture its solar panels.  After the company fired about 1,100 workers on Aug. 31 and
filed for bankruptcy, the  Federal Bureau of Investigation 
searched its Fremont, California headquarters.  The federal loan was used to help build the company’s
factory, which opened in January.  The case is In re Solyndra LLC 11-12799,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  -- Editors: Fred Strasser, Mary Romano  To contact the reporter on this story:
