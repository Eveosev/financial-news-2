Silver futures tumbled, heading for
the biggest two-day drop in 28 years, on investor sales to cover
losses from the rout in equities and raw materials.  More than $3.4 trillion has been erased from equity values
this week, sending global stocks into a  bear market , as the
Federal Reserve’s U.S. stimulus plan and a pledge by Group of 20
nations fails to ease concern that the global economy is on the
brink of a recession. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of
19 raw materials fell to the lowest since November.  “We’re in a ‘risk-off’ mentality,”  Bill O’Neill , a co-
founder of Logic Advisors in  Upper Saddle River , New Jersey,
said in a telephone interview. “Some of it certainly is a case
of sell the winning assets to meet the margin calls for the
losing assets. We’re seeing massive selling across the spectrum
in commodities.”  Silver futures for December delivery fell $4.273, or 12
percent, to $32.305 an ounce at 12:04 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . A close at that price would mark a two-day drop of 20
percent, the most since February 1983.  Before yesterday, silver jumped 31 percent this year as
Europe’s debt crisis boosted the appeal of the metal as a haven.  To contact the reporter on this story:
