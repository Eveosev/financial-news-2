The European Union removed
sanctions on the Libyan  National Oil Corp.  as forces opposed to
 Muammar Qaddafi  extend control over the country.  National Oil and Zueitina Oil Co. are the latest Libyan
entities whose assets the EU is unfreezing as the country’s
National Transitional Council seeks to establish its authority
after moving to Tripoli from the eastern city of Benghazi, where
the uprising began in February.  The EU announced the lifting of the sanctions today in the
 Official Journal . The 27-nation bloc took the decision yesterday
in Brussels.  NTC forces said yesterday that they have gained control of
most of southern Libya, including the desert town of Sabha,
while efforts continue to oust Qaddafi’s loyalists from Bani
Walid and Sirte.  In a separate  decision  published today, the EU said it
would refrain from applying sanctions to new activities of the
Central Bank of  Libya , Libyan Arab Foreign Bank,  Libyan
Investment Authority  and Libyan Africa Investment Portfolio
while keeping frozen their assets targeted before Sept. 17.  The EU also allowed for exemptions from the asset freeze
against the four entities in cases where the funds would be used
for such purposes as humanitarian needs, energy and water for
civilians, the resumption of Libyan production of hydrocarbons
and efforts to restart the country’s banking operations,
including in connection with international trade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
