India ’s central bank will allow
banks and financial companies to set up infrastructure debt
funds to attract investments into building roads, ports and
power plants in  Asia ’s third-largest economy.  Banks and finance companies with a minimum net worth of 3
billion rupees ($61 million) will be eligible to set up
infrastructure debt plans as mutual funds, the  Reserve Bank  of
India said in an e-mailed  statement  today.  India, which the World Economic Forum ranks below war-
ravaged Ivory Coast for the quality of its infrastructure, wants
to double spending on public work projects to $1 trillion in the
five years to 2017. The South Asian nation is losing about 2.5
percentage points in growth a year from regulations and approval
requirements that deter investment in roads, ports and power
generation, Credit Suisse Group AG estimates.  Banks setting up such funds would have to adhere to
existing rules including limits on their investments in
financial services companies, and in equities and bonds.  The finance minister in his budget speech for the current
fiscal year had announced the setting up of infrastructure debt
funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
