Corn rebounded from a two-month low,
paring a weekly loss, on lingering concern that global output
will not be enough to meet demand. Wheat also advanced.  The December-delivery contract rose as much as 0.9 percent
to $6.56 per bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, after
slumping to $6.475 yesterday, the lowest price for the most-
active contract since July 12. The grain traded at $6.555 at
9:47 a.m. in  Singapore , trimming the fourth weekly loss to 5.3
percent, and headed for the worst monthly performance since June.  Global output in the year that began July 1 will be smaller
than forecast a month earlier after the outlook for the U.S.
crop was cut, the International Grains Council said. Demand will
exceed harvests, paring global stockpiles to 119 million metric
tons by June 2012, from 127 million tons a year earlier, it said.  “The fundamentals, particularly for the corn market,
remain quite supportive of prices,”  Michael Creed , an agribusiness
economist at the National Australia Bank Ltd., said by phone
from  Melbourne . “There’s no reason to be bearish on prices just
yet.”  World harvests will be 845.2 million tons in 2011-2012,
smaller than the 849.1 million tons forecast in August, the
London-based council said yesterday. Demand will be 853 million
tons, it said, paring a forecast from 858 million tons, as some
feed users switch to alternatives, including wheat.  December-delivery wheat gained 1.3 percent to $6.42 per
bushel in Chicago, narrowing the worst weekly loss for the most-
active contract since July 1. Yesterday, it plunged as much as
5.2 percent to $6.3225 a bushel, the lowest price since July 12.  Wheat production will likely rise to 679 million tons, from
651 million tons a year earlier, the council said, raising its
estimate from 677 million tons. Demand will match output this
year, it said, increasing its outlook from 678 million tons.  “Wheat is very much dictated by what’s going on in the
corn market,” Creed said. “Throughout  Asia , there is very
strong demand for feed-wheat because of high corn prices.”  Soybeans for November were little changed at $12.8325 per
bushel, set for a 5.3 percent loss this week, the biggest drop
for the most-active contract since the five days to March 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
