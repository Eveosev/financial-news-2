Azerbaijan , the third-largest oil
producer in the former  Soviet Union , plans to borrow more than
$10 billion from foreign lenders to build a complex to refine
crude and natural gas, the state energy company said.  The government will fund about 30 percent of the estimated
$15 billion project, which will take the rest of the decade to
complete, said Tofiq Qahramanov, vice president for strategic
projects at State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, or Socar, said at a
conference in Baku today.  The complex will be able to turn 10 billion to 15 billion
cubic meters of natural gas a year into products including
propane and butane, while the refinery will be able to process
10 million metric tons of crude annually, Qahramanov said,
without providing further details.  Azerbaijan, on the western side of the  Caspian Sea , exports
oil and gas to European markets via the Black Sea and pipelines
through Georgia and  Turkey . The country produced 31.7 million
metric tons of oil and 17.2 billion cubic meters of gas in the
first eight months of the year, declines of 7.1 percent and 2.2
percent, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
