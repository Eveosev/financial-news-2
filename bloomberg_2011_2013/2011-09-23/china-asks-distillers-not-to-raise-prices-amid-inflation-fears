China ’s top economic planning
commission asked liquor makers including Wuliangye Yibin Co. not
to raise prices as the country grapples with inflation that
reached a three-year high in July.  Representatives from Kweichow Moutai Co., Wuliangye, Luzhou
Laojiao Co., Anhui Gujing Distillery Co. and other distillers
attended a Sept. 16 meeting in which the National Development
and Reform Commission made the request, the China Alcoholic
Drinks Industry Association said Sept. 19 on its website.  The request was aimed at stopping the sort of increases
that Wuliangye, China’s largest liquor maker by sales, announced
last month, when it said it would raise prices 20 percent to 30
percent starting Sept. 10. The NDRC said in May it would fine
Unilever, the world’s second-largest maker of  consumer goods ,
for announcing price increases, amid government efforts to
control inflation.  “Considering recent inflation pressure, liquor products
play a special role in stabilizing market consumption even
though they are not staple consumer goods,” the drinks industry
association said.  Moutai, the world’s second largest distiller by market
value, may raise prices before Oct. 1, the 21st Century Business
Herald reported Sept. 16, citing an unidentified person familiar
with the situation.  China’s inflation eased in August to 6.2 percent after
reaching 6.5 percent in July, a three-year high.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
