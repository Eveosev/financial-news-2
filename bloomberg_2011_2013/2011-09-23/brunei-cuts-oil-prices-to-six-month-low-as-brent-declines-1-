Brunei Shell Petroleum Co., the
Southeast Asian country’s biggest oil producer, cut the official
selling prices for its crude to the lowest in six months after
London-traded Brent futures fell in August.  The oil producer retroactively priced its Seria Light
Export Blend at $116.28 a barrel for August, a company official
said today, asking not to be identified because of internal
rules. That’s down $7.11, or 5.8 percent, from July. The
Champion grade, a low-sulfur variety fixed at 15 cents below
Seria Light, was set at $116.13 a barrel.  Brent crude futures dropped 1.6 percent in August, the
third monthly decline in four, as weaker  consumer confidence  in
the U.S. and  Europe  bolstered speculation fuel demand will fall.
The contract for November settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange, trading near $106 a barrel today, is
down almost 8 percent so far in September.  Brunei Shell is a joint venture between  Royal Dutch Shell
Plc (RDSA) , Europe’s largest oil company, and the Brunei government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
