Tanzania’s shilling climbed for the
first time in five days against the dollar as companies bought
the local currency to make payments.  The currency of  East Africa ’s second-biggest economy
appreciated 0.3 percent to 1,639.5 per dollar by 11:37 a.m. in
 Dar es Salaam , the commercial capital, paring its retreat this
week to 0.2 percent, a third week of declines.  “We have seen some demand for the shilling coming from
companies that need local currency to meet end-of-quarter
obligations like paying taxes,” Zainul Chandoo, head treasurer
at Stanbic Bank Tanzania Ltd., Standard Bank Group Ltd.’s local
unit, said by phone from Dar es Salaam.  To contact the reporter on this story:
