Confidence in U.S. high-yield debt
fell to approach the lowest levels in two years as a pledge by
Group of 20 nations to address rising risks failed to ease
concern that the global economy is on the brink of another
recession.  The Markit Group Ltd. CDX North America High Yield Index,
which falls as investor confidence deteriorates, declined 0.2
percentage point to 91.4 percent of face value as of 9:28 a.m.
in  New York , according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd.
That’s its fifth decline in six days. The index decreased to 91
on Sept. 12, which was the least since September, 2009.  The index declined on concern that the global economy is
weakening even after G-20 officials said they were “committed
to a strong and coordinated international response to address
the renewed challenges facing the global economy.”  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
