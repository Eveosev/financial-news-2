Jones Day , the third-biggest U.S.
law firm, hired David Brewster, a former mergers-and-
acquisitions partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, to
bolster its Boston office.  “His joining the Boston office immediately places Jones
Day among the leaders of Boston M&A and moves us closer to our
goal of creating a full-service office locally,” Traci Lovitt,
partner-in-charge of Washington-based Jones Day’s Boston branch,
said in a  statement .  Brewster spent more than 25 years at Skadden, where he
advised companies on mergers, leveraged buyouts and
restructurings, according to the statement. He got his
undergraduate degree from  Northeastern University  and his law
degree from  Harvard Law School , Jones Day said.  Jones Day opened its Boston office in January, according to
the firm’s  website . Jones Day is the third-largest U.S. law firm
by number of attorneys, with more than 2,500,  according  to the
National Law Journal, a trade publication. Skadden is sixth,
with more than 1,800, according to the National Law Journal.  Skadden, based in  New York , ranked first last year among
law firms in advising on announced global mergers and
acquisitions by dollar value, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Jones Day was 16th, according to the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
