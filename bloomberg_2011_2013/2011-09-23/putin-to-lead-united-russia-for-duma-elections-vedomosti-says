Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin will lead the ticket of his  United Russia  party in
December parliamentary elections, Vedomosti reported, citing
unidentified party officials,  Putin and President  Dmitry Medvedev , who has been urged by
his advisers to announce a re-election bid, won’t make any
announcement about which of them will run for president in March
at United Russia’s two-day congress that starts tomorrow, the
