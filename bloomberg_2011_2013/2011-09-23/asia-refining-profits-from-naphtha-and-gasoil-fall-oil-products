Asia  refining profits from making
naphtha and gasoil fell this week. Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought
ultra-low diesel and gasoline in Singapore, the region’s largest
oil-trading center.  Middle Distillates  Shell bought gasoil, or diesel, with 10 parts-per-million
of sulfur in Singapore for a second day, according to a
Bloomberg News survey of traders monitoring the Platts window.
 Europe ’s biggest oil company purchased 150,000 barrels from
Vitol Group at $2.85 a barrel over benchmark quotes. PetroChina
Co. sold a similar cargo to BP Plc at a premium of $2.90, the
survey showed.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude rose 2 cents
to $16.39 a barrel, according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a
London-based broker. This crack spread, a measure of refining
profit, narrowed for a third week.  Jet fuel ’s premium to gasoil gained 40 cents to $1.75 a
barrel, based on PVM data. This regrade widened 25 percent this
week, after narrowing the previous three weeks, indicating it is
more profitable to produce  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Hin Leong Trading Pte sold 100,000 barrels of jet fuel to
BP at 35 cents a barrel below October quotes, the survey showed.  Light Distillates  Vitol Group sold 50,000 barrels of 95-RON gasoline to
Mercuria Energy Ltd. at $120.80 a barrel. Petrochina sold
another 50,000 barrels of 95-RON to Shell at $120.70 a barrel.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures
slumped to $119.81 a ton at 6 p.m.  Singapore  time from $127.56
at the end of trading in Asia on Sept. 16, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Fuel Oil   Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 8 cents to
$4.15 a barrel, according to PVM. The gap narrowed for a third
week, signaling reduced losses for refiners turning crude into
residual products.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
was unchanged at $8.25 a ton, the lowest since Aug. 31, PVM
said. This viscosity spread narrowed for a third week,
indicating higher-quality fuel oil fell more than bunker, or
marine fuel.  To contact the reporters on this story:
