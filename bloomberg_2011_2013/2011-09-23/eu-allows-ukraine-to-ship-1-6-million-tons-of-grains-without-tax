Ukraine will be able to export 1.6
million metric tons of grains to the European Union without
duties in 2013 once the former Soviet state signs a free-trade
area agreement with the 27-member bloc.  Ukraine will be permitted to ship 950,000 tons of wheat,
250,000 tons of barley and 400,000 tons of corn, Halyna Karpa,
spokeswoman at the  Agriculture Ministry  in Kiev, said today by
phone. Ukraine will be able to increase shipments without duties
to 2 million tons within a 5-year period, Karpa said.  Ukraine, a country of 46 million people, aims to sign a so-
called association agreement with the EU, by mid-December, First
Deputy Prime Minister Andriy Klyuev said last week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
