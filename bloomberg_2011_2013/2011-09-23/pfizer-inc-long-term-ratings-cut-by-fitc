Pfizer Inc. (PFE) ’s credit rankings were
cut by  Fitch Ratings  for failing to pay off more of its debt
since the world’s biggest drugmaker acquired Wyeth in 2009.  The London-based rating service reduced Pfizer to an A+
from AA- saying its leverage level “is still not commensurate
with” the higher rating. Fitch expected the New York-based
company to reduce its debt to 1.3 times earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, said Michael Zbinovec, a Fitch analyst based in  Chicago . Instead, the New
York-based company cut its debt to 1.5 times Ebitda, he said.  Zbinovec said Pfizer had tripled its debt load after the
$68 billion acquisition of Wyeth in 2009. A combination of the
debt and a reduction in revenue growth prevented the drugmaker
from reaching the target, he said.  “Pfizer’s ability to pay its debt obligation is somewhat
constrained,” Zbinovec said. “But the new rating should be
good for the next year and a half even with the acceleration in
patent expirations that will affect Pfizer.”  The patent on Pfizer’s best-selling drug Lipitor expires in
November. The cholesterol medicine generated $10.7 billion in
2010.  Fitch also revised its outlook to stable from negative.  To contact the reporter on this story:
