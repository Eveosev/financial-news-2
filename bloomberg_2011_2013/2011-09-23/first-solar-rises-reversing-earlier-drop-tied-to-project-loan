First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the largest maker
of thin-film solar panels, rose as much as 8.4 percent, erasing
earlier losses prompted by concerns that pending U.S. loan
guarantees might not close by a Sept. 30 deadline.  First Solar climbed $3.39, or 5.1 percent, to $70.24 at
4:29 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, rebounding today from
a four-year low. The Tempe, Arizona-based company has lost 46
percent of its value this year.  First Solar yesterday said it wouldn’t get a $1.9 billion
guarantee from the U.S. Energy Department for its Topaz power-
generation project and would continue to seek a buyer. The loss
came just two weeks after panel-maker Solyndra LLC filed for
bankruptcy and left U.S. taxpayers responsible for much of its
$535 million guarantee. First Solar still expects to close on
two other loan guarantees before a Sept. 30 deadline.  “This is a volatile stock in a volatile political period
for the industry,” Paul Clegg, an analyst at Mizuho Securities
USA in  New York , said today in an interview. He has an
‘outperform’ rating on the shares and owns none.  First Solar currently has conditional guarantees of $680
million for a 230-megawatt project and $1.8 billion for a 550-
megawatt project, according to the Energy Department’s  website .
The company received a $967 million guarantee for a project in
 Arizona  in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
