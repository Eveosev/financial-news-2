India ’s market regulator said
investors can raise their holdings in companies to as high as 25
percent without having to offer to buy additional shares from
the public starting next month.  The Securities and Exchange Board of India raised the limit
from 15 percent, according to a statement on its website.
Investors who exceed the limit will have to buy an additional 26
percent, according to SEBI.  The regulations will help companies attract investors amid
a fall in the stock market. India’s benchmark stock index had
its biggest two-day drop in 31 months with the BSE India
Sensitive Index, or Sensex, declining 1.2 percent today. The
gauge has retreated 4.6 percent this week.  In Japan, the trigger for an open offer is 33.3 percent,
while in  Hong Kong  it is 30 percent and in Singapore 29.99
percent. In all three, breaching the limit requires an acquirer
to make an offer for the entire company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
