South Korea’s won reversed losses
and gained the most in almost four months after authorities said
they were prepared to intervene to curb declines.  The currency rose 1.1 percent to 1,167.31 per dollar at the
3 p.m. close in Seoul, reversing a loss of 1.4 percent, after
the  finance ministry  said it will “take action” to stabilize the
 currency market , after holding an emergency meeting with the
central bank before markets opened. “The herd behavior on one-
way bets has been excessive in the recent currency market,” the
ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
