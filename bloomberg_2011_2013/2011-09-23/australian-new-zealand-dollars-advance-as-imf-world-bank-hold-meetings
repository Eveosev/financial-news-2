The Australian dollar rebounded
from its lowest levels in more than five months against the U.S.
currency as the Group of 20 nations pledged to address rising
risks to the global economy.  The Aussie snapped a two-day decline versus the greenback
after Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services affirmed the country’s
AAA credit rating with a stable outlook.  New Zealand ’s currency
fell against the yen and the dollar for the fifth day, the
longest losing streak since March, as investors bet the central
bank will refrain from raising  interest rates .  Shorter-term investors who bet that the Australian dollar
would decline from above parity are “probably happy to take
profit ahead of the weekend in case something does get agreed on
from the G-20,” said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a Singapore-based
strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. “The market’s really
looking for some type of circuit breaker to get out of this
risk-averse mode that we’re in at the moment.”  Australia ’s dollar appreciated 0.3 percent to 97.71 U.S.
cents at 11:50 a.m. in  New York , from 97.42 cents yesterday.
Earlier it touched 96.69 cents, the weakest level this year. The
Aussie advanced 0.5 percent to 74.61 yen, from 74.27, and
touched 73.65 yen, the lowest since August 2010.  New Zealand’s currency, nicknamed the kiwi, fell 0.3
percent to 77.84 U.S. cents, from 78.05 cents yesterday. It
touched 77.24 cents, the weakest since April. The kiwi declined
0.2 percent to 59.38 yen and touched 58.83 yen, the lowest level
since March, from 59.50.  Weekly Losses  The Aussie lost 5.4 percent over the past five days against
the greenback, the worst week since May 2010. The New Zealand’s
dollar fell 6.1 percent this week, the most since January 2009.  Governments and central banks are “committed to a strong
and coordinated international response to address the renewed
challenges facing the global economy,” G-20 policy makers said
in a statement released after talks in  Washington  yesterday.  The  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand is “highly likely” to
postpone an interest-rate increase until the first quarter of
next year, Hamish Pepper, a currency strategist at Barclays Plc,
wrote in a research note today. Barclays cut its three-month
forecast for the  New Zealand dollar  to 75 U.S. cents. The Aussie
may drop to 93 cents over the same period, Pepper wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
