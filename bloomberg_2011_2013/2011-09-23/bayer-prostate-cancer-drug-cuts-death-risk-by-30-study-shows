An experimental drug developed by
 Bayer AG (BAYN)  and  Algeta ASA (ALGETA)  prolonged the lives of men with prostate
cancer that’s spread to their bones, a study found.  A trial of the drug, called Alpharadin, in 922 men was
stopped early after an interim analysis showed that patients
receiving it on top of standard treatment had a 30 percent lower
risk of dying than those receiving just the current therapy,
according to data presented today at a cancer conference in
 Stockholm .  The results suggest Alpharadin may be the first drug to
improve survival in men with cancer of the prostate that’s
spread to the bone, a worsening of the disease that occurs in 90
percent of men with the advanced stage. Bayer plans to apply for
regulatory approval in  Europe  and the U.S. by the middle of next
year, said Anna Koch, a spokeswoman for the Leverkusen, Germany-
based company.  “This is really practice-changing,” Jean-Charles Soria, a
professor of medicine at the Institute Gustave Roussy in Paris,
said at a briefing with reporters. “Pending approval, it’s
going to be a major player in prostate cancer.”  Alpharadin, also known as radium-223 chloride, may generate
peak sales of 640 million euros ($864 million) by 2018,
according to Alistair Campbell, an analyst at Berenberg Bank in
 London . The drug works by emitting small doses of alpha
radiation that damage the DNA of cancer cells, killing them,
without harming healthy cells.  To contact the reporter on this story:
