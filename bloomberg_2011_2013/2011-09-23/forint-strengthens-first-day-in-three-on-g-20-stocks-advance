The forint strengthened the first
day in three against the euro and stocks rose on speculation
Group of 20 nations may act to revive global economic growth.  The forint appreciated 0.8 percent to 289.57 per euro by
10:25 a.m. in Budapest, paring its decline this week to 1.6
percent. Hungary’s benchmark BUX Index rallied 1.3 percent, the
biggest jump in a week and rebounding from a two-year low.  The G-20 nations are “committed to a strong and
coordinated international response to address the renewed
challenges facing the global economy, notably from heightened
downside risks from sovereign stresses, financial system
fragility, market turbulence, weak economic growth and
unacceptably high unemployment,” finance chiefs said in a
statement released after talks in  Washington .  “Following a strong collapse on the stock markets, the
announcement was a welcome opportunity for the financial markets
to pause for reflection,”  Lutz Karpowitz , a strategist at
Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt , wrote in a research report today.
“The recovery is unlikely to last long.”  Hungarian stocks have retreated 8.4 percent this week as
OTP Bank Nyrt., the country’s largest lender, plunged 18 percent
in the five days. The lender snapped a four-day losing streak to
increase 2.2 percent to 3,062 forint today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
