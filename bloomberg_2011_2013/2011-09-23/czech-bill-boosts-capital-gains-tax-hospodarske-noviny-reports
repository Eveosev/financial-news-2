Czech lawmakers are debating a bill
raising the tax on capital gains to 19 percent from 15 percent
and extending it to a wider circle of investors from 2013,
 Hospodarske Noviny  reported, citing the draft legislation.  The government will tax profit on assets held by investors
for less than five years, compared with a ceiling of six months
now, the Prague-based newspaper wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
