U.S. stocks rose, trimming the Dow
Jones Industrial Average’s worst weekly loss since 2008,
European equities rebounded and Treasuries fell amid signs
policy makers will act to prevent the debt crisis from
worsening. Silver plunged the most since at least 1979.  The Dow added 0.4 percent to 10,771.48 at 4 p.m. New York
time, paring this week’s loss to 6.4 percent. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.6 percent to 1,136.43 after losing
7.1 percent in the first four days of the week. The Stoxx  Europe 
600 Index rose 0.6 percent. Ten-year Treasury yields surged 11
basis points to 1.82 percent after touching a record low 1.67
percent. Silver sank 18 percent and gold slid 5.9 percent,
giving futures the biggest two-day loss since 1983.  Europe’s governments are speeding the setup of a permanent
rescue fund, an internal working paper shows. The  European
Central Bank  may step up efforts to ease financial-market
tensions, including offering banks 12-month loans, Governing
Council members said. About $3.5 trillion had been erased from
global equity values this week before today, driving the MSCI
All-Country World Index into a bear market and price-earnings
ratios down to the lowest levels since March 2009.  “If the ECB can come up with a more credible plan that
suggests that they are being aggressive in dealing with a
deteriorating financial system, this market is going to respond
very positively,”  Alan Gayle , a senior strategist at RidgeWorth
Capital Management in Richmond,  Virginia , which oversees about
$48 billion, said in a telephone interview.  Stability Mechanism  Stocks drifted between gains and losses for most of the day
before heading higher after a staff paper obtained by Bloomberg
News showed that senior European finance officials next week
will examine the cost advantages of creating the rescue fund,
known as the European Stability Mechanism, in July 2012, a year
ahead of schedule. The fund will have 500 billion-euros ($677
billion) that could help shield countries like  Italy  and
includes provisions for sharing costs with bondholders for
countries with “unsustainable” debt.  Group of 20 officials said after talks in  Washington  that
they were “committed to a strong and coordinated international
response to address the renewed challenges facing the global
economy.” U.S. stocks tumbled this week after the  Federal
Reserve  said there were “significant downside risks” to gross
domestic product and the central bank will replace shorter-term
Treasuries in its portfolio with longer-term debt in an effort
to suppress  interest rates  and bolster growth.  Bear Markets  Benchmark measures for 32 out of the 45 nations in the MSCI
All-Country World Index have posted 20 percent declines from
their respective peaks, meeting the common definition of a bear
market, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The MSCI gauge
passed that threshold yesterday, extending its slump since May 2
to 22 percent. Among the countries with the 20 biggest losses
from their highs, 18 are located in Europe. The exceptions are
 Hong Kong  and  Brazil . The  S&P 500  has fallen about 17 percent
since reaching a three-year high on April 29.  The S&P 500 started the session trading for 12.4 times
earnings in the last 12 months, within 2 percent of a low of
12.2 reached Aug. 8, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The ratio
would have to narrow another 18 percent to match its level on
March 9, 2009, the start of the bull market in which the gauge
rose as much as 102 percent, the data show.  The price-earnings ratio as of yesterday was 5.1 percent
below the S&P 500’s average valuation of 13 at its lowest point
in the last nine bear markets,  data compiled by Bloomberg show.
To reach the lowest of those, 7 on June 21, 1982, the index
would have to fall 43 percent to about 640, based on profit in
the last 12 months of $91.41 a share.  BofA, Intel  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  rallied 4.1 percent, rebounding from
a two-year low, for the top gain in the Dow.  Intel Corp . and
Home Depot Inc. also climbed more than 2 percent to lead the
benchmark average higher.  Seven of the 10 main industry groups in the S&P 500 rose,
with companies that rely on discretionary  consumer spending  and
financial stocks leading gains. Ford Motor Co. rallied 2.5
percent after saying U.S. sales of  pickup trucks  are at their
highest pace since December. The S&P 500 Financials Index
rebounded from its lowest level since July 2009, with Citigroup
Inc. gaining 4.3 percent, JPMorgan Chase & Co. up 1.1 percent
and Wells Fargo & Co. climbing 2.2 percent.  Gold futures fell as much as $110 to $1,631.70 an ounce as
some investors sold the metal to cover losses in other assets.
Silver futures for December delivery tumbled 18 percent to
$30.101 an ounce, the most since October 1979. Copper lost 6
percent to $3.28 a pound and touched $3.215, the lowest for a
most-active contract in more than a year.  Commodities Index  The S&P GSCI Index of commodities slumped 1.4 percent to
the lowest level on a closing basis in almost 10 months.  European stocks erased a drop of as much as 2.6 percent in
the Stoxx 600 as Societe Generale SA and BNP Paribas SA,
 France ’s biggest banks, climbed more than 8.7 percent to lead a
rally in financial shares. The Stoxx 600 declined to the lowest
level since July 2009 yesterday, extending the loss from this
year’s high on Feb. 17 to 26 percent. The index lost 6.1 percent
this week, the most since Aug. 5.  A measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another in
Europe rose for a third day to the highest since March 2009. The
Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the three-month euro
interbank offered rate and overnight index swaps, climbed to 89
basis points as of 5:10 p.m. in  London , from 85 yesterday,
Bloomberg data show.  Less Lending  Money-market mutual funds reduced lending to European banks
further last month, with the biggest U.S. funds cutting their
holdings to the lowest in at least five years, as the region’s
sovereign debt crisis worsened. The 10 biggest U.S. funds
eligible to purchase corporate debt, with a combined $676
billion, reduced European bank assets to 42 percent of holdings,
the lowest level since at least 2006,  Fitch Ratings  said today
in a report.  Among European bond markets, yields on Italian and Spanish
10-year debt fell, while rates on U.K., French and German debt
increased.  Greece ’s two-year yield surged 317 basis points, or
3.17 percentage points, to 69.69 percent.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index slumped 1.6 percent,
extending its weekly loss to 11 percent, the most since November
2008. South Korea’s Kospi Index tumbled 5.7 percent for the
biggest drop among global equity gauges, while  Russia ’s Micex
