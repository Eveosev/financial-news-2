HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt AG
threatened to withdraw from talks about purchasing some WestLB
AG units,  Handelsblatt  reported today, citing unidentified
people with knowledge of the matter.  The threat resulted from a dispute with savings banks in
North Rhine-Westphalia about the potential sale of WestLB’s
business with small and medium-sized companies, the newspaper
said.  The sale process has “not been interrupted,” an
unidentified WestLB spokesperson told Handeksblatt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
