Former  Baltimore Ravens  and
Cleveland Browns offensive tackle Orlando Brown, who once sued
the  National Football League  for $200 million after a penalty
flag hit him in the eye, was found dead today. He was 40.  Brown’s body was discovered this morning in a downtown
Baltimore apartment after family members notified the police
when they couldn’t locate him, the Ravens said on their  website .
The cause of death isn’t yet known.  “We’re forever grateful for what he did for the Ravens
organization and what he did for the present team,” Baltimore
coach John Harbaugh said on the team’s website. “We can’t
express our sorrow enough on behalf of our team and our
organization for his loss today.”  Brown started 119 games in a nine-year career with the
Ravens and Browns. He retired after the 2005 season.  On Dec. 19, 1999, while playing for  Cleveland , Brown was
hit in the eye by a penalty flag thrown by referee Jeff Triplette. His eyesight was damaged and he didn’t play for three
seasons.  Brown sued the league for $200 million and settled for $25
million, according to the Baltimore Sun.  He is survived by three sons, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
