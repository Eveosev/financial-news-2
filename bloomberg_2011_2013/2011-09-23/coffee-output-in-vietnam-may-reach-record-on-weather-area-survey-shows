Vietnam , the second-largest coffee
grower, may produce a record crop in the upcoming harvest as
favorable weather and a larger cultivated area boost output in
the 2011-2012 season, increasing global supplies.  Production may total 1.32 million metric tons, according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 12 traders, growers
and exporters. That compares with 1.12 million tons, or 18.7
million, 60-kilogram bags, in the last crop, according to a U.S.
Department of Agriculture estimate. For 2011-2012, the USDA has
forecast output of 1.24 million tons, which would be an all-time
high, according to data stretching back to 1959.  Record production from Vietnam, the largest grower of
robusta coffee, used in instant drinks, may boost exports and
further lower prices that have shed 23 percent from their peak
this year. Coffee has slumped on speculation that supplies may
gain as a slowdown in global growth pares demand.  “A lot of new trees have come into play and the weather
has been favorable,” Jens Nielsen, founder of Singapore-based
 Oriental Coffee & Commodities Pte , said in a telephone interview
yesterday. “I am in no doubt we will see a new, record crop.”  Robusta futures surged to $2,672 per ton on March 18 on
 London ’s NYSE Liffe, the highest level in three years, on
concern that availability was constrained. The November-delivery
contract -- which fell to $1,996 yesterday, the lowest price
since July 21 -- was at $2,048 at 4:53 p.m. in  Singapore  today.  ‘Rude Health’  The survey finding matches the outlook from Volcafe, the
coffee unit of commodities trader ED&F Man Holdings Ltd., which
forecast a record Vietnam crop of 22 million bags (1.32 million
tons) in 2011-2012, according to a report earlier this month.
The report cited a crop “in rude health,” with rising output
backed by expansion, excellent farm management and good weather.  The harvest in Vietnam may replenish local stockpiles,
which are almost depleted after the rally in the initial months
of 2011 prompted farmers to sell more of their crop earlier in
the year, cutting export volumes in later months. Shipments may
have been 40,000 tons in August, according to an estimate from
Vietnam’s General Statistics Office on Aug. 25. That’s 49
percent lower than in the same period last year.  “The coffee price has been very good this year, and it may
prompt farmers to start picking some coffee early,” Nguyen Van An, general director of Thai Hoa Production & Trading Corp., the
country’s third-biggest exporter, said in a telephone interview.
The peak of the crop is likely to come in November, he said.  Largest Region  Weather conditions in  Dak Lak  province, Vietnam’s largest
coffee-growing region, will be favorable for production over the
next ten days, the Dak Lak Hydrology and Meteorology Office said
in a Sept. 21 report, with heavy rains at times.  Rain in  Buon Ma Thuot , the biggest coffee-growing area in
Dak Lak, totaled 1,433 millimeters (56.4 inches) this year,
compared with 1,206.5 millimeters in the same period last year,
according to figures from the meteorology office.  “There has been a lot of rain in the region and it’s very
good for the crop at this point,” said Bui Hung Manh, head of
the business department at Tay Nguyen Coffee Investment, Import
and Export Co., the country’s biggest shipper. “But if more
rains come during the picking period and drying time, then it’ll
hurt the harvest,”  Vietnam’s total area planted to coffee rose 1.8 percent to
548,200 hectares (1.35 million acres) in 2010-2011, the Ministry
of Agriculture and  Rural Development  said on Feb. 9.  To contact the reporters on this story:
