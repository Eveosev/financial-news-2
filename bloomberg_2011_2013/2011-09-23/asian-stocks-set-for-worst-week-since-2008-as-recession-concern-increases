Asian stocks fell, driving a
regional benchmark index toward the biggest weekly drop in
almost three years, on concern policy makers worldwide are
running out of tools to avert another global economic recession.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s No. 1 mining company,
slumped 3 percent in Sydney after crude oil and metal prices
tumbled yesterday and today. Korea Zinc Co., which produces gold
and silver, plunged 15 percent in  Seoul  and Samsung Electronics
Co., South Korea’s biggest exporter of consumer electronics,
lost 4.1 percent.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a clothing retailer that
gets most of its revenue in Europe, sank 4.6 percent in Hong
Kong, taking its losses in the last two weeks to 58 percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index dropped 2.1
percent to 371.65 as of 8:04 p.m. in Tokyo, poised for a 10
percent weekly drop, the most since November 2008. The measure
has plunged 15 percent this month amid concern  Europe ’s debt
crisis is spreading and signs of slowing U.S. economic growth.  “It would be flippant to suggest this is just a blip,”
said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage $1 billion in equities at
Pengana Capital Ltd. in  Melbourne . “The aggressive selling of
equity markets seems to reflect a heightened probability that
the world is moving toward a recession. There’s also a sense
that policy makers globally are limited in their ability to
alleviate the situation because of the need for fiscal
austerity.”  Volatility Surges  The Asia Pacific index pared declines today after finance
chiefs from the Group of 20 nations said they would address
“heightened downside risks” from sovereign debt and a slowing
global economy. The gauge briefly resumed losses after Moody’s
Investors Service downgraded the long-term deposit and senior
debt ratings of eight rated Greek banks by two levels.  Market fluctuations have driven gauges of volatility up
across the region, with  Hong Kong ’s HSI Volatility Index jumping
29 percent this week and a similar measure in Korea advancing 30
percent. Five-day historical implied volatility on the Asia
Pacific excluding Japan Index jumped 45 percent this week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The broader MSCI Asia Pacific Index that includes Japanese
shares, which didn’t trade today, fell more than 20 percent from
its May 2 high in intraday trading today, breaching a level some
investors say signifies a bear market.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index closed down 1.6 percent. New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index dropped 0.9 percent, making it the last
benchmark gauge in the developed world to erase all this year’s
gains, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. South  Korea ’s
Kospi Index lost 5.7 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index
sank 1.4 percent. Japanese markets are closed today for a public
holiday.  ‘Strong’ Response  The G-20 is “committed to a strong and coordinated
international response to address the renewed challenges facing
the global economy, notably from heightened downside risks from
sovereign stresses, financial-system fragility, market
turbulence, weak economic growth and unacceptably high
unemployment,” according to a statement released in  Washington .  Global share declines yesterday sent the MSCI All-Country
World Index of 45 nations into a bear market for the first time
in more than two years after the worsening European debt crisis
and threat of a U.S. recession erased more than $10 trillion
from equities since May. The world index has lost more than 20
percent since peaking on May 2.  U.S. stocks slumped yesterday in  New York , sending the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  to its biggest two-day decline since
December 2008. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 3.2 percent.
Futures on S&P 500 Index gained 0.9 percent today.  European Stocks  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index tumbled 4.6 percent yesterday to
a two-year low after the  Federal Reserve  signaled “significant
downside risks” to the world’s largest economy and Moody’s
Investors Service downgraded three U.S. banks. The gauge rose
0.8 percent today.  BHP Billiton, Australia’s biggest oil producer, fell 3
percent to A$34.55 in Sydney. Rio Tinto Group slid 3.8 percent
to A$62.65.  Alumina Ltd. (AWC) , a partner in the largest global
producer of the material used to make aluminum, declined 1.1
percent to A$1.385.  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) , the nation’s No. 2
oil and gas producer, slid 3.6 percent to A$31.37. In Seoul,
Korea Zinc tumbled 15 percent to 341,000 won and steelmaker
Dongkuk Steel Mill Co. retreated 14 percent to 22,650 won.  A measure of primary metals traded in  London  fell 6.4
percent yesterday for a fifth straight daily decline. New York-
traded copper futures dropped as much as 7.8 percent today.
Crude oil for November delivery lost as much as 2.7 percent
today in after-hours trading, having slumped 6.3 percent on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday.  Exporters Slide  Exporters also tumbled today. Esprit sank 4.6 percent to
HK$8.23 in Hong Kong. Samsung slipped 4.1 percent to 758,000 won
in Seoul and  LG Electronics Inc. (066570) , South Korea’s second-largest
electronics maker, lost 4.6 percent to 58,200 won.  In Hong Kong,  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , the biggest supplier of
clothes and toys to retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,
decreased 3.5 percent to HK$12.52.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  declined 1.9 percent to HK$59.50. The
bank, Europe’s largest, may report lower revenue for the second
half of the year than previously estimated, analysts at Espirito
Santo Investment Bank wrote in a report following a meeting with
HSBC’s finance director.  The MSCI Asia Pacific ex Japan Index lost 21 percent this
year through yesterday, compared with a 10 percent drop for the
S&P 500 and a decline of 22 percent for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index. Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 10.4 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 11.4 times for the
S&P 500 and 9.1 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporter on this story:
