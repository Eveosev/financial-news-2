     Sept. 23 (Bloomberg) --Farmers in southern  Pakistan  have
been hit by rain and floods that are worse than last year’s
flooding, with heavy monsoon rains destroying crops, the  United
Nations ’ Food and Agriculture Organization said.  The rains have destroyed or damaged 73 percent of crops and
67 percent of food stocks in the affected districts in Sindh
province, and killed nearly 78,000 head of livestock, the Rome-
based FAO said in a statement on its website today.  The UN agency is asking for $18.9 million to provide
emergency livestock and agricultural assistance, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
