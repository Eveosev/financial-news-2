Asian stocks pared declines after
Finance chiefs from the Group of 20 nations said they would
address “heightened downside risks” from sovereign debts and a
slowing global economy.  The MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index fell 2.5
percent to 369.86 as of 11:28 a.m. in  Tokyo , trimming an earlier
loss of as much as 3.1 percent. The index is set for its worst
week of decline since 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
