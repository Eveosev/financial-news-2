The Group of 20 nations will act to
maintain financial stability and economic growth, French Finance
Minister  Francois Baroin  said.  Speaking to reporters after a meeting of his G-20
colleagues, Baroin said European policy makers would defend the
regionâ€™s financial stability, and that they were open to the
idea of support from other governments.  The G-20 will respond to risks posed by sovereign debts,
Baroin said, and will seek to balance the need to reduce budget
deficits and encourage economic growth. Central banks will
provide liquidity to banks as needed, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
