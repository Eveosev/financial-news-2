A neutrino beam appears to have
moved faster than the speed of light in an experiment whose
results need to be confirmed independently, CERN, the European
Organization for Nuclear Research, said.  Italy’s INFN Gran Sasso Laboratory observed the beam on a
730-kilometer (454-mile) path by analyzing data from CERN,
located on the border between Switzerland and  France , CERN said
in a  statement  on its website today.  The measurement is “at odds with well-established laws of
nature,” CERN said, adding it will present results on a webcast
today at 4 p.m. Geneva time. “Given the potential far-reaching
consequences of such a result, independent measurements are
needed before the effect can either be refuted or firmly
established.”  According to conclusions drawn by the theoretical physicist
 Albert Einstein , nothing can exceed the speed of light.  To contact the reporter on this story:
