Natural gas futures gained for the
first time in four days as forecasts showed hot weather in the
U.S. South, raising demand for the power-plant fuel.  Gas rebounded from an 11-month low as forecasters including
Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland , said
temperatures will be above normal through Oct. 2. Houston and
Dallas may reach highs above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius)
this weekend.  “We saw some higher temperatures in Texas,” said  James Williams , an economist at WTRG Economics, an energy research
firm in  London , Arkansas. “Gas is also rebounding after the big
decline earlier this week.”  Natural gas for October delivery gained 0.8 cent, or 0.2
percent, to $3.713 per million British thermal units at 12:13
p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Gas fell to $3.705
yesterday, the lowest settlement price since Oct. 27. Prices
have dropped 16 percent this year and are heading for the fifth
weekly decline in six weeks.  November $3.75 puts, bets that prices will fall, were the
most active options in electronic trading. The puts rose 0.1
cent to 13.3 cents per million Btu on volume of 119 lots.  The price difference, or spread, between futures for
delivery in October 2011 and January 2012 narrowed 1.4 cents to
46.4 cents. The contracts represent the difference in price
between gas for delivery in the fall, when mild weather reduces
fuel use, and the winter, when demand is highest.  Texas  Heat  Dallas and Houston may “have another shot at triple-digit
temperatures this Sunday and Monday, with a quick burst of
stronger warming expected across the area,”  Matt Rogers ,
president of Commodity Weather Group, said in a note to clients.
The eastern U.S. will see normal temperatures from Sept. 28 to
Oct. 2, he said.  New York will have a high of 72 degrees Fahrenheit (22
Celsius) on Sept. 28, 2 degrees above normal, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College , Pennsylvania. Chicago will
have a high of 75 degrees.  Power plants  use about 30 percent of the nation’s gas
supplies, Energy Department data show.  Gas supplies rose 89 billion cubic feet to 3.201 trillion
in the week ended Sept. 16, above the five-year average gain of
72 billion, an Energy Department report yesterday showed.  A shortfall to five-year average inventory levels narrowed
to 1.1 percent from 1.6 percent the previous week, according to
the report.  Marketed gas production will average 65.79 billion cubic
feet a day in 2011, up 6.4 percent from 61.83 billion last year,
the Energy Department said in its monthly  Short-Term Energy
Outlook  on Sept. 7.  To contact the reporters on this story:
