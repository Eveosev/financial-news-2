(Corrects headline to say lowest level in two years.)  The ruble fell for an 11th day,
headed for its weakest close against the central bank’s target
dollar-euro basket since September 2009.  The ruble lost 0.4 percent to 37.2033 against the basket as
of 5:21 p.m. in Moscow, heading for a weekly loss of 3.9
percent, the biggest decline since July 2009. The ruble slid 0.3
percent to 32.155 per dollar and 0.4 percent to 43.325 per euro.  Urals crude,  Russia ’s chief export earner, is poised for
its worst weekly retreat since May as commodity prices tumbled
amid concern the global economy is headed for recession.
Russia’s central bank may have sold as much as $1.6 billion
yesterday to stem the ruble’s longest losing streak to the
basket since January 2009, according to VTB Group, Russia’s
second-largest lender.  “Russian monetary authorities are doing their best to keep
the situation under control,” Nikolay Podguzov, head of fixed-
income strategy in Moscow at VTB Capital, the investment-banking
arm of VTB, said by e-mail today. “Not everything depends on
the central bank -- external factors matter. If we see a big
event in  Europe , it will be difficult to remain optimistic.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
