Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said the government was focused on implementing the
July 21 accord for financing for  Greece  and no other options
were being considered.  “Greece has taken the definitive decision to do whatever
it can to fully and punctually implement all the decisions of
the European Council of July 21,” Venizelos said in an e-mailed
statement from the Athens-based ministry today.  He said “all other conversations, rumors, comment and
scenarios” just serve to distract attention from this central
goal.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
