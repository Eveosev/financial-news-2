Sugar futures in  New York  fell to a
three-month low as signs of increased output from Asia added to
concerns that faltering economic growth will leave a surplus as
demand slows. Cocoa and coffee also declined.  Sugar production in India may be the highest in four years,
based on the estimates in 10 states, including the biggest
growers. Cane output in  Thailand  may increase 11 percent this
year, an official from the Sugar Technology Program said.
Commodities and equities fell today on speculation that the
world may slide into recession.  “There’s talk of higher production in Thailand that would
help offset a decline in  Brazil , and there’s overall pressure on
this market coming from a weak commodity-demand outlook,”  Boyd Cruel , a senior analyst at Vision Financial Markets in  Chicago ,
said in a telephone interview.  Raw sugar for March delivery dropped 0.68 cent, or 2.7
percent, to settle at 24.13 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York, after touching 24.01 cents, the lowest
since June 16. The commodity has plunged 19 percent this month,
including 8.3 percent this week.  Cane production in Thailand may be 105 million metric tons
in the coming season, up from more than 95 million tons last
season, the Sugar Technology Program’s Klanarong Sriroth said
yesterday at a forum in Beijing.  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery fell 7.8
cents, or 3.3 percent, to $2.3145 a pound on ICE. Prices are
down 20 percent this month.  Cocoa futures for December delivery slid $46, or 1.7
percent, to $2,634 a ton in New York. Prices fell 5.7 percent
this week.  In  London , refined sugar, robusta coffee and cocoa fell on
NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
