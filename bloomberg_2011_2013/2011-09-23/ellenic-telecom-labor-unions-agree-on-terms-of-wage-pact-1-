Hellenic Telecommunications
Organization SA (HTO)  and worker unions today agreed on terms for a
new collective wage accord, the OME-OTE labor group said.  The main provisions include a reduction in the work week to
35 hours from 40 with a corresponding wage cut of a weighted
average of 11 percent over the next three years, Athens-based
OME-OTE said in an e-mailed statement.  The agreement is about “ensuring  job security ” and the
company won’t cut wages for any “external reasons” for the
duration of the agreement, OME-OTE said.  The accord specifies a return to existing wage levels and
work schedules by Jan. 1, 2015, the labor group added. Hellenic
Telecom started meeting with labor groups in July to discuss
ways to reduce payroll costs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
