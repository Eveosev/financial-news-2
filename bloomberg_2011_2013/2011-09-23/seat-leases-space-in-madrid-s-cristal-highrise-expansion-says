Seat SA, the Spanish carmaking unit
of  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , leased space in one of  Madrid ’s newest
highrise office complexes, Expansion reported, citing
unidentified people in the market.  The company will pay almost 500,000 ($675,000) euros a year
in rent, or 30 euros a square meter monthly, for the 1,300
square-meter space, a higher rate than recent leases in Madrid’s
Cuatro Torres Business Area, the newspaper said.  The maker of the Ibiza and Altea models took part of the
34th floor of the Torre de Cristal, one of four buildings in the
complex, breaking the ice for Spanish companies that have
considered the complex too luxurious for today’s economic
situation, Expansion said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
