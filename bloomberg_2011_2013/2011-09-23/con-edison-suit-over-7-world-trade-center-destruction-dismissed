Consolidated Edison Inc. (ED) ’s lawsuit
over the destruction of 7 World Trade Center in the Sept. 11,
2001, terrorist attacks was dismissed by a federal judge in New
York.  U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein today threw out the
suit against the developer of the 47-story tower and its primary
tenant, Salomon Inc., a unit of  Citigroup Inc. (C) , calling the
legal theory underlying it “farfetched and tenuous.”  A Con Ed power station below the office building was
destroyed when it collapsed, hours after terrorists crashed
airliners into the two nearby World Trade Center towers.  Con Ed filed the suit against Citigroup, the developer and
the architects, engineers and contractors responsible for
planning and building the tower. Hellerstein dismissed the
claims against the architects, engineers and contractors earlier
in the case.  Franklin Sachs, a lawyer representing Con Ed in the suit,
didn’t immediately return a voice-mail message seeking comment
on the ruling after regular business hours today.  The case is In re Sept. 11 Litigation, 21-MC-7272, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of  New York  ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
