U.S. 30-year bonds headed for their
best week in almost three years after the  Federal Reserve  and
Pacific Investment Management Co., manager of the world’s
biggest bond fund, issued warnings on the economy.  The extra yield long bonds offer over two-year notes
narrowed to 2.56 percentage points yesterday, the least since
March 2009. Futures contracts fell today as finance chiefs from
the Group of 20 nations said they will take “all necessary
actions” to support financial markets. Treasuries trading was
closed in  Japan  for a holiday.  “We’re darn close to a recession,” said Marc Fovinci, who
helps oversee $2.9 billion as head of fixed income at Ferguson
Wellman Capital Management Inc. in  Portland , Oregon. “The bias
is toward lower rates. We bought last week.”  Thirty-year yields dropped 52 basis points this week to
2.80 percent as of yesterday in  New York , according to Bloomberg
Bond Trader prices. It was the steepest decline since November
2008. The 3.75 percent security maturing in August 2041 rose 10
30/32, or $109.38 per $1,000 face amount, to 119 6/32.  A plunge in stocks spurred demand for the relative safety
of U.S. government debt yesterday, pushing benchmark 10-year
yields to a record low of 1.6961 percent. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  fell 3.5 percent, bringing its two-day
retreat to 5.9 percent, the biggest back-to-back slide since
December 2008, when the  U.S. economy  was in a recession.  ‘Unadulterated Panic’  “It was just sheer and unadulterated panic,”  Adam Carr ,
senior economist in Sydney at ICAP Australia Ltd., part of the
world’s largest interdealer broker, wrote in a report today.  The gap between 10- and two-year yields narrowed to 1.50
percentage points yesterday, the least since January 2009.  The world is on the eve of a financial crisis, Mohamed El- Erian, co-chief investment officer at Pimco, said yesterday.  Bill Gross , who runs the $245 billion Pimco Total Return
Fund in  Newport Beach , California, said in a Twitter post that a
recession is looming in developed economies. “Euroland already
there,” he wrote. “U.S. to follow shortly?”  Gross increased Treasury holdings to 16 percent of assets
in August from 10 percent in July, Pimco’s website showed.  The TED spread, the difference between what lenders and the
U.S. government pay to borrow for three months, widened to 36
basis points, the most in 14 months.  The G-20 will “commit to take all necessary actions to
preserve the stability of banking systems and financial markets
as required,” the group’s policy makers said in a statement
issued after talks in  Washington .  Ten-year futures contracts for December delivery declined
9/32 to 131 14/32 in electronic trading at the Chicago Board of
Trade today as of 12:54 p.m. in Singapore.  U.S. 30-year bonds have returned 16 percent this month,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data. An index of
debt securities around the world gained 1.16 percent.  The MSCI All Country World Index of stocks handed investors
