France  will say next week that it
plans to cut net issuance of government debt by as much as 16
percent in 2012 from this year as it reduces its  budget deficit ,
according to BNP Paribas SA.  Net issuance will decrease to between 75 billion euros
($101 billion) and 80 billion euros from almost 90 billion euros
this year, analysts including London-based  Ken Wattret  wrote in
an investor report yesterday.  Franceâ€™s gross funding needs will be little changed at 180
billion euros to 185 billion euros, compared with 184 billion
euros this year, because the nation will have higher bond
redemptions than this year, the analysts wrote.  France will announce the funding needs on Sept. 28, the
analysts wrote in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
