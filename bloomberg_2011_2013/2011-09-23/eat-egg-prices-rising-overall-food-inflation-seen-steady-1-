U.S. consumers will pay more for
meat and eggs this year than forecast earlier, while overall
food inflation will hold steady at the 3 percent to 4 percent
projected a month ago, the Department of Agriculture said.  The USDA left its 2011 food-price forecast unchanged for
the seventh straight month, at a rate that would be the highest
since 2008. The department kept its estimate for the increase in
retail food costs for 2012 steady at 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent,
in a  report  released today on its website.  “Cost pressures on wholesale and retail food prices due to
higher food commodity and energy prices, along with
strengthening global food demand, have pushed inflation
projections upward” from previous years, Richard Volpe, a USDA
food-inflation economist, wrote in  a note  accompanying the
report. “Price levels in 2012 will hinge significantly on
several macroeconomic factors, such as weather conditions, fuel
prices and the value of the  U.S. dollar .”  The agency increased its 2011 projection for meats, poultry
and fish expenses by a half of a percentage point, to 5.5
percent to 6.5 percent. It raised its egg-price forecasts for
both years, estimating a gain of 5 percent to 6 percent this
year and 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent next year.  Earlier this month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said
consumer food costs rose 0.5 percent in August, capping a 12-
month gain of 4.6 percent.  Corn futures in Chicago jumped 29 percent in the past year
through yesterday, soybeans and cattle climbed 18 percent and
hogs gained 7.4 percent. Wheat has declined 20 percent this
year, after rising 47 percent in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
