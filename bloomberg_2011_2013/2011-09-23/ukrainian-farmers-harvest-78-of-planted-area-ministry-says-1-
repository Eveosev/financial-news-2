Ukrainian farmers harvested 78
percent of the area planted with grains, the  Agriculture
Ministry  said, without giving a comparison with last year.  The harvest to date, including wheat and barley, was 37.6
million metric tons, the Kiev-based ministry said today in e-
mailed statement. The average yield was 3.1 tons a hectare (2.47
acres), up from 2.6 tons last year, it said.  About 2.4 million tons of corn was harvested from 469,000
hectares, or 13 percent of the planted area, the ministry said.
Corn yields advanced to 5.22 tons a hectare compared with 4 tons
a year earlier.  Sunflower harvesting was completed on 59 percent of the
seeded area and 4.8 million tons were reaped. Yields increased
to 1.8 tons a hectare from 1.5 tons.  Farmers planted 3 million hectares with winter wheat, which
will be harvested next year from late June. Thatâ€™s 45 percent of
the 6.7 million hectares forecast to be planted with winter
wheat.  To contact the reporters on this story:
