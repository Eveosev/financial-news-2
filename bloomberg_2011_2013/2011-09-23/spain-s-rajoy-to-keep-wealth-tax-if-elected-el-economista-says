Spain ’s opposition People’s Party’s
leader  Mariano Rajoy  won’t cancel the wealth tax reintroduced
this week by the Socialists for two years if he is elected,  El
Economista  reported, citing unidentified party members.  Rajoy is under pressure from local party leaders to
maintain the tax, which generates funds for Spanish regions, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
