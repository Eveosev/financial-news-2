The cost of insuring against
default on European sovereign and financial debt rose to records
amid renewed concerns the global economy is on the brink of
another recession.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of credit-default swaps
on the senior debt of 25 banks and insurers jumped as much as 23
basis points to an all-time high of 325, and cost 313 at 1:30
p.m. in  London , according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. The Markit
iTraxx SovX Western  Europe  Index of swaps on 15 governments rose
5.5 to 365.5, CMA prices show.  A pledge from the Group of 20 to address risks to the
economy failed to reassure investors Europe’s sovereign debt
crisis can be contained. More than $3.4 trillion has been erased
from equity values this week, driving global stocks into a  bear
market  and the lowest valuations since March 2009.  Policy makers’ assurances aren’t “likely to provide the
boost to sentiment markets so desperately require,” said
Harpreet Parhar, a strategist at Credit Agricole SA in London.  Swaps on sovereign debt of Belgium,  France ,  Germany , Italy
and  Spain  also rose to records. Contracts on Belgium jumped 10
basis points to 304, France climbed 3.5 to 206, Germany
increased four to 110, Italy rose 13 to 547 and Spain was 17
higher at 450, CMA prices show.  A gauge of subordinated financial debt risk rose 28 basis
points to 568.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
on 50 companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings soared 25
basis points to a 2 1/2-year high of 881.5, after earlier
dropping as much as 23 basis points.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 10 basis points to 209.5, the
highest since March 2009, JPMorgan prices show.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.5 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
