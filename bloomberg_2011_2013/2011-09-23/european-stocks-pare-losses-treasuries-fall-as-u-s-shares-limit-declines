U.S. stocks rebounded following a
four-day rout and European shares reversed declines amid
speculation central banks will take measures to prevent a
financial crisis. Treasuries fell and commodities pared
declines. The euro rose versus the dollar.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.6 percent as of
10:52 a.m. in  New York  after losing as much as 0.7 percent. The
gauge is down 6.6 percent this week. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index
rose 0.2 percent after tumbling as much as 2.6 percent. Ten-year
Treasury yields rose five basis points to 1.77 percent after
earlier falling to a record. The S&P GSCI Index of materials
fell 0.3 percent, paring a 2.2 percent loss.  More than $3.4 trillion has been erased from equity values
this week, driving global stocks into a  bear market  and the
lowest valuations since March 2009. The  European Central Bank 
may step up efforts to boost growth and ease financial-market
tensions as early as next month, Governing Council members said.
Austria’s Ewald Nowotny and  Belgium ’s  Luc Coene said in
Washington that potential measures include the reintroduction of
12-month loans to banks.  "You’d expect to see some stability after an aggressive
selloff, but it’s Friday and the question is: do investors want
to go long over the weekend?"  Alan Gayle , a senior strategist at
RidgeWorth Capital Management in Richmond, Virginia, which
oversees about $48 billion, said in a telephone interview. "The
ECB is saying good things, but the market is looking for more
tangible steps."  ‘International Response’  Group of 20 officials said after talks in Washington they
were “committed to a strong and coordinated international
response to address the renewed challenges facing the global
economy.”  U.S. stocks fell this week on the  Federal Reserve ’s
assessment that the turmoil caused by Europe’s crisis is taking
a toll on the economy. The S&P 500 has fallen 17 percent since
April 29 amid concern about a global economic slowdown.
Benchmark indexes for the U.S., U.K., Canada, Singapore and  New
Zealand  are the only ones among 24 developed countries that
haven’t fallen at least 20 percent from their highs, entering a
bear market.  The S&P 500 is trading for 12.4 times earnings in the last
12 months, within 1 percent of the 30-month low of 12.2 reached
Aug. 8, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The ratio is would have
to narrow another 18 percent to match its level on March 9,
2009, the start of the  bull market  in which the gauge rose as
much as 102 percent, the data show.  Among the 10 main industry groups in the  S&P 500 , five rose
and five declined today. Gauges of industrial and utility
companies in the S&P 500 rose more than 0.8 percent for the top
gains, while energy and consumer-staples providers lost at least
0.6 percent for the biggest declines.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
