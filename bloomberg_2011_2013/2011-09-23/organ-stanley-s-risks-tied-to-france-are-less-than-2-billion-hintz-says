Morgan Stanley (MS) , whose shares
dropped yesterday on concern French losses will mount, faces
less than $2 billion of risks linked to the country, according
to Brad Hintz, a Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analyst.  “There is solid evidence that shows Morgan Stanley has
been taking action to limit risk in preparation for potentially
difficult market conditions ahead,” Hintz, who is based in New
York, wrote in a note to clients today. “We estimate that total
risk to  France  and its banks is less than $2 billion net of
collateral and hedges.”  Morgan Stanley said in a filing last year that its exposure
was about $39 billion to French lenders, which are falling on
concern  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis will spur losses. That
figure exaggerates the value of the New York-based bank’s actual
risks because it includes all funds in French accounts, such as
client holdings, and excludes collateral posted to Morgan
Stanley, Hintz wrote.  Morgan Stanley management has increased capital and boosted
its liquidity pool to contend with Europe’s crisis, Hintz wrote.  Shares of the company dropped 52 percent this year through
yesterday as global equities fell into a  bear market  this week
for the first time in more than two years. Morgan Stanley
climbed 33 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $13.39 in composite trading
on the New York Stock Exchange at 9:39 a.m.  Mark Lake, a company spokesman, declined to comment on
Hintz’s report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
