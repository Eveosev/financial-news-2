The  News Corp. (NWS)  unit that published
the Sun and the now defunct News of the World, was sued in
London by a person identified only as “Mr. A. Coulson.”  The lawsuit was filed yesterday, according to court
filings. Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson, who
resigned as U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron’s press chief in
January, was arrested in July as revelations widened that
reporters hacked into the voice mails of celebrities,
politicians and murder victims, and may have bribed police for
stories.  News Corp.’s U.K. unit was considering whether it should
stop paying Coulson’s legal bills following reports that the
company made some payments to him after he became Cameron’s
director of communications, the  Guardian newspaper   said  in
August.  Glenn Mulcaire , the private investigator jailed in 2007
over phone hacking, sued the company last month after the
company stopped paying his legal fees.  Available court documents didn’t specify the full first
name of Coulson or the subject of the lawsuit.  Coulson’s lawyer, Jo Rickards, didn’t immediately respond
to an e-mail seeking comment. News Corp.’s U.K. unit declined to
immediately comment.  The case is A Coulson v. News Group Newspapers Ltd., case
no. 11-3525,  High Court  of Justice, Queen’s Bench Division
(London).  To contact the reporter on this story:
