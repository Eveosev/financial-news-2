South Africa , the biggest corn
producer on the continent, will probably cut its forecast for
this seasonâ€™s harvest, a survey showed.  The country may say farmers will reap 10.5 million metric
tons of corn compared with the 10.68 million tons estimated in
August, according to the median estimate of nine traders
Bloomberg surveyed. Forecasts ranged from 10.1 million to 10.62
million tons.  The  Crop Estimates Committee  will issue an eighth
assessment of the crop on Sept. 27 at 3:30 p.m. in Johannesburg.  White corn for December delivery, the most active contract
on the South African Futures Exchange, declined 0.04 percent to
2,248 rand ($270) a ton by 9:23 a.m. in Johannesburg trading.
Yellow corn for December delivery fell 0.5 percent to 2,217 rand
a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
