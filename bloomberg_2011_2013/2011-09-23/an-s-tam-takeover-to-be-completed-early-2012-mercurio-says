Lan Airlines SA (LAN)  aims to complete
the takeover of Brazilian carrier  Tam SA (TAMM4)  in the first quarter of
2012, El Mercurio wrote, citing Ignacio Cueto, Lan’s president.  Of all conditions imposed by Chile’s antitrust regulator to
approve the takeover, the most complicated are having to resign
four flight frequencies with stops in Lima, Peru, and the
obligation to review code sharing agreements, cited Cueto as
saying.  Lan hasn’t decided whether it will appeal the conditions
for the takeover to Chile’s Supreme Court, Cueto told the
Santiago-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
