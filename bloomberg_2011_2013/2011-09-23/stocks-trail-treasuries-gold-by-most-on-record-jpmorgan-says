Stocks are having the worst quarter
on record relative to U.S. Treasuries and gold, which may force
investors to buy equities to rebalance their allocations,
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s Marko Kolanovic said.  U.S. and emerging-market equities have returned 43
percentage points less, the most during a quarter since at least
2002, according to data compiled by Kolanovic, whose analysis is
based on a model portfolio composed of stocks, bonds and gold.  “This underperformance may trigger significant quarterly
rebalance flows into equities and out of Treasuries at the end
of next week,” Kolanovic, the New York-based global head of
equity derivatives strategy at JPMorgan, wrote in a note to
clients yesterday.  Stocks lagged behind by 42 percentage points during the
fourth quarter of 2008, after the bankruptcy by Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. spurred the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression, JPMorgan data show. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 
bottomed at a 12-year low in March 2009, beginning a  bull market 
that produced a 102 percent gain through April 2011.  Concern that European officials may fail to contain the
region’s debt crisis and the  U.S. economy  will slip into a
recession has prompted investors to shun risky assets. Benchmark
measures for 32 of the 45 nations in the MSCI All-Country World
Index have posted 20 percent declines from their respective
peaks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors have
sought refuge in  U.S. government debt  and precious metals,
pushing yields on 10-year notes to a record low and gold futures
to all-time highs.  Kolanovic performed the study using a model portfolio that
has 30 percent invested in the  S&P 500 , 20 percent in the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index and 10 percent in the Russell 2000 Index.
It holds 35 percent in 20-year and seven-year Treasuries, and 5
percent in gold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
