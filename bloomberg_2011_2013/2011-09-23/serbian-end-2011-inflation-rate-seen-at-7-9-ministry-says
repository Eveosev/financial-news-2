Serbia ’s  Finance Ministry  said the
inflation rate will keep dropping through 2012 when it should
reach 3.5 percent.  Inflation, which fell to an eight-month low of 10.5 percent
at the end of August after a three-year peak of 14.7 percent in
April, is projected to reach 7.9 percent at the end of this
year, the Belgrade-based ministry said today in an  update  of the
government’s economic forecasts.  The latest forecasts are part of the fiscal strategy report
that lays the ground for 2012 budget planning, the ministry
said. The Balkan nation, which hopes to become a European Union
candidate in December, adjusted its forecasts to those of the
 International Monetary Fund  which sees the economy expanding 2
percent this year and 3 percent in 2012.  The Balkan nation’s current-account deficit will be equal
to 7.6 percent of economic output this year, and widen to 8.7
percent in 2012, the ministry said.  The government expects a drop in the country’s foreign
trade deficit to 15.1 percent of GDP in 2011 from 15.2 percent
this year.  The administration of Prime Minister  Mirko Cvetkovic ,
facing general elections by spring 2012, sees GDP per capita
increasing to 4,799 euros ($6,470) next year from 4,518 euros in
2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
