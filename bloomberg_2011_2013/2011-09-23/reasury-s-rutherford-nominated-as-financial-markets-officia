Matthew Rutherford , who oversees
the  U.S. Treasury ’s debt-management office, was nominated by
President  Barack Obama  to be the department’s assistant
secretary for financial markets.  Rutherford, who is the Treasury’s deputy assistant
secretary for federal finance, would replace  Mary Miller , who
has been nominated as undersecretary for domestic finance. The
White House announced Rutherford’s nomination in a statement
today.  Rutherford, 33, and Miller, 56, led debt management as the
U.S. approached the Obama administration’s Aug. 2 deadline for
raising the federal debt ceiling. The office Rutherford oversees
makes debt-issuance decisions to finance the government.  After months of debate in Congress, lawmakers agreed to
raise the limit in increments and Obama signed the legislation
on Aug. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
