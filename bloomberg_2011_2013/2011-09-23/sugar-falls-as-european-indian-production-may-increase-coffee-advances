Sugar fell for a third day in  New
York  on speculation supplies will be enough to meet demand due
to expanding crops in  Europe  and  India , the world’s second-
largest producer. Coffee slid as commodities fell.  Sugar production in India may surge to 25.83 million metric
tons, the highest level in four years, a compilation of
estimates by sugar cane commissioners of 10 states including
 Uttar Pradesh  and Maharashtra, the biggest growers, show.
Europe’s crop for the season starting Oct. 1 will be 30 million
tons, the highest since 2005-06, F.O. Licht estimates.  “The supportive effects of recent concerns about lower
Brazilian sugar output were offset by better output figures for
India, Australia and Europe for the coming season,” Lysu Paez,
an analyst at Natixis SA in Paris, said in a report e-mailed
yesterday.  Raw sugar for March delivery dropped 1.4 percent to 24.47

$626.40 a ton on NYSE Liffe in London.  The sugar cane crop in  Brazil ’s main producing region will
drop for the first time in a decade to 510.2 million tons in the
2011-12 season, according to industry group Unica. The South
American country is the world’s largest producer of sugar.  White sugar has fallen 15 percent in London and 7 percent
in New York in the third quarter.  Indian Exports  India may have an exportable surplus of 4 million tons in
the year starting Oct. 1 as output surges, according to the
National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories Ltd.  Arabica coffee for December delivery fell 0.3 cent, or
0.1 percent, to $2.3895 a pound in New York. Robusta coffee for
November delivery retreated $3, or 0.2 percent, to $2,023 a ton
