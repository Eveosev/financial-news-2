Stada Arzneimittel AG (SAZ)  is confident
it can reach its targets for 2014, even after it wrote down 97
million euros ($131 million) in unpaid bills from Serbian
pharmaceutical wholesalers,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 
reported today, citing Chief Executive Officer Hartmut Retzlaff.  The company still aims for sales of 2.15 billion euros and
profit adjusted for special items of 215 million euros by 2014,
Retzlaff was quoted by the German newspaper as saying. When
Stada’s acquisitions, including the purchase of Cetraben and
Spirig Pharma’s Swiss generic drugs business, have been
completed, the earnings outlook for 2014 may be raised, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
