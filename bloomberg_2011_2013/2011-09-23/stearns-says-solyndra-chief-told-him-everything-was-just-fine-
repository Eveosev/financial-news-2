Representative  Cliff Stearns , a
Florida Republican, said Solyndra Chief Executive Officer Brian
Harrison “assured me that everything was just fine” about 30
days before the company closed and filed for bankruptcy.  Stearns spoke today at a U.S. House Energy and Commerce
Committee investigations panel hearing on the Energy
Department’s decision to give Solyndra, a solar-panel maker, a
$535 million loan guarantee in September 2009. The company
sought protection from creditors on Sept. 6.  Representative Diana DeGette of  Colorado , the top Democrat
on the panel, said while the subcommittee should examine why
Solyndra got the guarantee, it should also review whether U.S.
policies are adequate to “ensure that U.S. manufacturers can
compete in the global clean-energy market.”  Harrison attended the hearing with Chief Financial Officer
Bill Stover. Lawyers for both men said they would invoke their
Fifth Amendment rights and decline to answer questions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
