Los Grobo SA,  Argentina ’s second-
biggest soybean producer, plans to transfer some assets to a new
company and sell shares of the business in an initial public
offering in Brazil.  The company will be called LG Agronegocios & Participacoes
SA, according to a regulatory filing today. Los Grobo, which
produces soybeans, corn, wheat and sugar in Brazil, Argentina,
Uruguay and Paraguay, didn’t provide details on the timing or
value of the offering.  Los Grobo follows other agricultural companies in Brazil
and Argentina seeking to tap stock markets. Adecoagro SA, a farm
company with headquarters in Argentina and operations in Brazil,
held its IPO in  New York  in January, and closely held Saladillo,
Argentina-based El Tejar, the world’s biggest grains producer,
said it may hold an offering as early as 2012.  Earlier this month, BrasilAgro - Cia. Brasileira de
Propriedades Agricolas canceled its plans to sell additional
shares after it said market conditions “deteriorated.”  Argentina’s Grobocopatel family and Brazil’s Grupo Vinci
Partners, an investment company set up by former Banco Pactual
SA parter Gilberto Sayao, are among shareholders in LG
Agronegocios.  Credit Suisse Grupo AG, Banco Itau BBA SA, Banco BTG
Pactual SA and Banco Bradesco BBI SA will handle the offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
