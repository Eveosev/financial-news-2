Japanese and Australian stock futures
rose as the euro strengthened against the yen amid speculation
Europe’s debt crisis will ease and as oil prices climbed.  American depositary receipts of  Kyocera Corp. (6971) , a Japanese
electronics maker that gets more than half of its sales abroad,
gained 0.9 percent from the closing share price in Tokyo. Those

percent after the Nikkei newspaper reported the company aims to

at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200
Index rose 0.5 percent today.  “Investors are less concerned about Europe’s finances and
are returning to risk assets, which is positive for the
market,” said Hiroichi Nishi, an equities manager in Tokyo at
SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. “Gains will probably be limited
because there’s still some uncertainty about the outlook for the
U.S. economy.”  Aid for Greece  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent
today. In New York, the index advanced 1.1 percent yesterday
after  Jean-Claude Juncker , head of the group of euro-area
finance ministers, said European Union leaders will decide on
additional aid for Greece by the end of June and have ruled out
a “total restructuring” of the country’s debt.  Stocks in the U.S. gained even after the Institute for
Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said its business barometer fell
more than expected.  The yen depreciated to as low as 117.8 against the euro
late yesterday afternoon, compared with 117.05 at the close of
 stock trading . Against the dollar,  Japan ’s currency weakened to
81.77 from 81.38. A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas
earnings for Japan’s companies when repatriated.  Crude oil for June delivery gained 2.1 percent to settle at
$102.70 a barrel yesterday in New York on signs the EU will
approve aid for Greece. The London Metal Exchange Index of
