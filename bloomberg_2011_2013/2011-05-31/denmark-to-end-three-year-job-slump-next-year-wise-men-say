Denmark will emerge from three years
of job losses next year as economic growth reaches 2 percent in
both 2012 and 2013, the country’s  Economic Council  said.  The economy will grow 1.6 percent this year, losing a net
9,000 jobs, and then create 27,000 jobs in the following two
years, the council, known as the “Wise Men,” said today in a
report released in Copenhagen. The Nordic country lost a
combined 145,000 jobs in 2009 and 2010.  Denmark’s registered unemployment rate, which bottomed at
1.6 percent in June 2008, was 3.8 percent last month, equivalent
to 102,800 people, the statistics agency said May 27. The
government yesterday lifted its estimates for gross domestic
product growth this year and next and cut its 2011 deficit
estimate after the global economy revived.  “The development in employment isn’t strong enough to spur
any mentionable improvement in wage growth,” the Wise Men said
in the report. “Real wages will therefore continue to develop
weaker than productivity.”  Wages will grow 2 percent this year, less than consumer
price inflation of 2.5 percent, the Wise Men said. Next year,
wages will rise 2.2 percent, compared with inflation of 2
percent, the council said.  Denmark’s government said yesterday the economy will grow
by 1.7 percent this year and by 1.9 percent in 2012. The  budget
deficit  will widen to 4.1 percent of GDP this year, compared
with a December forecast of 4.7 percent, from 2.9 percent in
2010, the government said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
