Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  dropped as much as 8.5
percent in Helsinki trading after the Finnish mobile-phone
manufacturer cut its second-quarter and full-year devices and
services outlook.  The shares dropped as much as 49 cents to 5.27 euros and
were down 8.3 percent as of 3:11 p.m.  Nokia now expects devices and services net sales to be
substantially below its previously expected second-quarter range
of 6.1 billion euros to 6.6 billion euros, it said in a
statement today. The company said it lowered its forecast
because of lower than previously expected average selling prices
and mobile device volumes.  Chief Executive Officer Stephen Elop turned to Microsoft’s
Windows Phone 7 to restore Nokia’s smartphone prospects after
determining that the company’s own Symbian and MeeGo systems
couldn’t keep up with Google Inc.’s Android, the fastest-growing
smartphone platform, and  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
