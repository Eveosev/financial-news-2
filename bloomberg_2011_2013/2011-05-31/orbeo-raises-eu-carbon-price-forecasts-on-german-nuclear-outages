Orbeo raised some of its price
forecasts for European Union carbon permits after Germany
decided not to reopen eight closed nuclear stations.  Analysts including Paris-based Emmanuel Fages at Orbeo, the
carbon venture of  Rhodia SA (RHA)  and Societe Generale SA, raised
their estimate for the second quarter of this year by 8.1
percent to 17.30 euros a metric ton and by 3 percent for the
third quarter to 17 euros a ton, according to an e-mailed
research note dated yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
