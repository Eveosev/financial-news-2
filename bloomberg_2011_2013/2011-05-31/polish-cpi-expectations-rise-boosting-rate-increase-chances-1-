Polish inflation expectations rose
this month as the economy strengthened, boosting chances that
the central bank will raise  interest rates  soon.  Polish companies and households expect an annual inflation
rate of 4.3 percent within the next 12 months, up from 4 percent
in the April survey, the central bank said today on its website.  “These inflation expectations are likely to go up over the
next months, which could be worrying for the Monetary Policy
Council as they look out for second-round effects,” said  Maja Goettig , chief economist at Bank BPH in Warsaw, by phone. “This
could be another argument for the council to hike rates as soon
as June.”  The central bank unexpectedly raised its benchmark seven-
day reference rate by a quarter-point to 4.25 percent this
month, the third increase this year, after inflation accelerated
to 4.5 percent in April. Other eastern European countries,
including  Russia , are also increasing rates as central bankers
seek to combat inflation caused by rising food and oil prices.  Poland’s economy expanded 4.4 percent from a year earlier
in the first quarter, driven by private consumption, the  Central
Statistical Office  in Warsaw said today. Fixed investment rose
an annual 6 percent, compared with a revised 1.6 percent in the
fourth quarter and an 11.4 percent decline in the first quarter
of 2010.  The inflation expectations survey is compiled by researcher
Ipsos and the central bank from monthly interviews with about
1,000 people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
