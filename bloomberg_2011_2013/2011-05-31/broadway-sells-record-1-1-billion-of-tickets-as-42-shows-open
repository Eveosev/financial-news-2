Broadway sold a record $1.1 billion
of tickets in the past 12 months, buoyed by “Wicked,” “The
Book of Mormon” and other hits that charge $300 and up for the
top seats.  Ticket revenue was up 5.9 percent from a year ago, said the
Broadway League, a trade association of producers and theater
owners, in a release. The top sellers over the past week, which
included the three-day Memorial Day weekend, were “Spider-Man:
Turn Off the Dark” ($1.3 million), “Book of Mormon” ($1.2
million), “The  Lion King ” ($1.6 million) and “Wicked” ($1.7
million).  All told, 42 shows opened during the season, the second-
highest total in at least 24 years.  “We had such a variety of product,” said Stephanie Lee,
president of ticket agency Group Sales Box Office. “So many
shows opened, which is appealing to us because we have a lot to
talk about.”  Attendance was 12.5 million, up 5.4 percent from a year
earlier. Comparing revenue and attendance with previous seasons
is inexact. Every seven years the Broadway season is 53 weeks,
instead of 52. The 2010-2011 season was 53 weeks. Moreover,
“Young Frankenstein,” which ran from November 2007 to January
2009, never reported its grosses to the Broadway League, unlike
other shows.  The average ticket price, $86.21 in 2010-2011, was up 43
cents from $85.78 last season. Hits charge more, as producers
adjust prices based on demand.  Prices also vary widely at different sellers. As of 3 p.m.
this afternoon, a pair of fourth-row orchestra seats was
available for tonight’s “Mormon” -- an exuberant satire of
Mormonism and musicals -- for $815.75 from Telecharge.com, the
show’s primary ticket outlet.  Those prices are a bargain relative to what’s available for
tonight’s “Mormon” from the online marketplace StubHub: a pair
in the mezzanine sells for $1,181.  The Broadway League’s season total excludes markups that
online markets and ticket brokers charge.  Despite the record revenue, just one fall opening,
the Beatles tribute “Rain,” is still running on Broadway.
Among new musicals this spring, “Mormon” was the only one to
enjoy uniformly strong reviews.  The season’s two musical revivals, “How to Succeed in
Business Without Really Trying” and “Anything Goes,” have
played to full houses.  To contact the writers on this story:
