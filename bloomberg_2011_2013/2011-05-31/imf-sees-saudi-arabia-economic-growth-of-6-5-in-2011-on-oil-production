     May 31 (Bloomberg)  -- The  International Monetary Fund  said
it sees economic growth of 6.5 percent in Saudi Arabia this
year, with increased oil output boosting the fiscal surplus.  “The strong near-term economic outlook provides an
opportunity to address longer-term priorities,’’  Masood Ahmed ,
the Director of the Middle East and Central Asia Department,
said in an e-mailed statement today. “Key steps will be to
continue progress in diversifying the economy, building on the
positive business environment, and continuing to improve access
to finance” for small businesses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
