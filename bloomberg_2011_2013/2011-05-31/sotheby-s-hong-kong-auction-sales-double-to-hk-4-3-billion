     May 31 (Bloomberg) ---Sotheby’s  Hong Kong  auction sales
doubled in the first half to HK$4.3 billion ($540 million) from
the same period a year ago as demand rises, Patti Wong, 
chairwoman of Sotheby’s  Asia , said today.  The year-to-date tally was boosted by proceeds of HK$681
million from today’s sale of 25 works by 20th Chinese master
 Zhang Daqian , including a painting that sold for a record HK$191
million, including premium, to an Asian telephone bidder. The
price was more than nine times the high estimate.  The ink-and-color hanging scroll, entitled “Lotus and
Mandarin Ducks,” sets a record for Zhang, exceeding the HK$107
million established in May 2010 at China Guardian Auction Co.’s
spring sale.  The works sold today belonged to the Mei Yun Tang
Collection, amassed by Mr. and Mrs. Kao Ling-mei, friends of
Zhang’s for more than 40 years. The paintings have unparalleled
provenance (ownership credentials), said C.K. Cheung, the head
of  Sotheby’s (BID)  Chinese paintings department.  The first-half sales figures for Sotheby’s do not include
proceeds from after-auction sales and private sales, Wong said.  To contact the writer on the story:
