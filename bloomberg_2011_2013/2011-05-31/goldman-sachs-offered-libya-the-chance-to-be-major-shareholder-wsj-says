Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  offered
 Libya  the opportunity to become one of its biggest shareholders
two years ago, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing
unidentified people familiar with the matter and Libyan and
Goldman documents that it’s reviewed.  The offer of preferred shares or unsecured debt in Goldman
followed the almost total loss during the financial crisis of an
investment of $1.3 billion in the bank by the  Libyan Investment
Authority , the Middle East country’s sovereign wealth fund, the
newspaper said.  Talks between Goldman and the fund continued for months
during the summer of 2009, eventually coming to nothing, the
Journal said.  Discussions inside Goldman about how to repair the
relationship with Libya, which was furious about the loss,
included Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein,
David Viniar, the finance chief, and Michael Sherwood, the
bank’s top executive in Europe, the newspaper said, adding that
all three executives declined to comment  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
