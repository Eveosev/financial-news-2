Letting the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office set its own fees and keep all the money it collects is
“critical” to promoting innovation, according to the Commerce
Department, which oversees the agency.  The House is considering a measure known as the  America
Invents Act  that would mark a fundamental change in how patents
are reviewed and the biggest revision to U.S. patent law since
1952. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke wrote in support of the
proposed legislation in letters today to Representative  Lamar Smith , a Texas Republican who chairs the House Judiciary
Committee, and Michigan Representative John Conyers, the panel’s
top-ranking Democrat.  The Senate passed a similar measure in a 95-5 vote on March
8. Locke said the administration, which supported the Senate
version, wants “prompt passage” of legislation, saying it may
help promote  job creation .  “Enactment of a balanced bill is an important part of the
administration’s goal of ‘out-innovating’ our economic
competitors and winning the future -- and it can be done with no
cost to taxpayers and no addition to the deficit,” Locke wrote.  The House may take up the measure some time next month,
according to the office of Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a
Virginia Republican.  A key provision of the legislation would give the patent
office more power over its funding by allowing the agency to
alter its fee structure and keep Congress from diverting fees
for non-patent purposes.  ‘America’s Innovators’  “This structure is critical to enable the USPTO to better
meet the needs of America’s innovators,” Locke wrote,
suggesting there should be technical changes to allow the patent
office to make interim fee adjustments “so it can best use this
new authority on day one.”  The measure also calls for granting patents to the first
inventor to file an application, eliminating an often years-long
procedure to determine who first came up with an idea. The
first-to-file system is used in most countries.  “We strongly support the proposed transition of the  United
States  to a first-inventor-to-file system,” Locke wrote. It
would help U.S. businesses “by providing a more transparent and
cost-effective process that puts them on a level playing field
with the rest of the world.”  Among the companies supporting the proposal are  General
Electric Co. (GE) , DuPont Co., Eli Lilly & Co.,  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ,
 International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)  and Advanced Micro Devices
Inc. Trade groups backing the measure include those representing
the drug and biotechnology industries, universities, bankers,
financial services, insurance companies and accountants.  Some technology companies, including  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and  Apple
Inc. (AAPL) , have expressed reservations about certain provisions in
the legislation even as they have supported changes to how the
patent office is funded.  Other sections supported by the administration include a
new procedure to review issued patents and allowing third
parties to submit information on pending applications. Locke
said the administration will work with the committee to address
other provisions.  The House patent bill is H.R. 1249.  To contact the reporter on this story:
