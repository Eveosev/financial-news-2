The cost of insuring corporate bonds
against non-payment rose in  Japan , according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index advanced 3 basis points to
126 basis points as of 9:22 a.m. in Tokyo, according to
Citigroup Inc. prices.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index decreased 1 basis point
to 110 basis points as of 10:20 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking
Corp. prices show. The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50
investment-grade borrowers outside Japan also fell 1 basis point
to 110 as of 8:20 a.m. in Singapore, according to Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc.  Credit-default swaps protect bond investors against
default, and traders use them to speculate on credit quality. A
drop signals improving perceptions of creditworthiness.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
