Spot gasoline in the Midcontinent
market slipped to the weakest level in three weeks, the day
before it trades against the cheaper July futures contract.  “Everybody’s looking at backwardation on the” Nymex
exchange, said Jim Mosby, supply manager at ADMO Energy LLC, a
supply consultant in  Kansas City . Backwardation occurs when the
front-month contract has a higher value than later contracts.  Gasoline’s front-month contract has been priced higher than
the following month for almost two months. The June contract
expired at $3.1504 a gallon today on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , 10.01 cents above July.  The premium for conventional, 87-grade gasoline in the
Midcontinent over Nymex June futures narrowed 4 cents to 0.25
cent a gallon at 2:40 p.m. It was the smallest premium since May
5. The prompt price lost 0.2 cent to $3.1275.  In  Chicago , conventional gasoline’s premium to futures
gained 12 cents to 35 cents a gallon as a catalytic cracker at
Exxon Mobil Corp.’s 248,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Joliet,
 Illinois , was down for unplanned repairs. The price for prompt
delivery rose 13.91 cents to $3.4004.  In the Gulf Coast market, the fuel lost 3.25 cents to trade
at a 14.5-cent discount. The prompt-delivery price fell 1.35
cents to $2.9053.  To contact the reporter on this story:
