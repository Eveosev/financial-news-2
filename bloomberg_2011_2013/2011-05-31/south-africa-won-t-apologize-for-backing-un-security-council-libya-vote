South Africa  won’t apologize for
backing the United Nations Security Council resolution that
allowed the bombing of troops allied to Libyan leader  Muammar
Qaddafi  by forces from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
and other countries.  “By the time we voted on the resolution more than 2,000
people were mowed down by their own government,” Maite Nkoana-
Mashabane, South Africa’s Minister of International Relations
and Cooperation, told lawmakers in Cape Town today.  South Africa’s President Jacob Zuma has raised the issue of
locating the body of Anton Hammerl, a South African photographer
killed by Libyan forces, and returning it to South Africa with
Qaddafi, the minister said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
