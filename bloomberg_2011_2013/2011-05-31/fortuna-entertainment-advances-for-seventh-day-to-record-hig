Fortuna Entertainment Group NV (FORTUNA)  gained
for a seventh day to its highest price on record after the Czech
bookmaker offered to buy assets of bankrupt competitor Sazka AS.  The stock rallied 8 percent to 148 koruna by 11:21 p.m. in
Prague, its strongest intraday level since it started trading in
October 2010. The gain made Fortuna the best performer in the PX
index of 15 companies, which advanced 0.6 percent.  Fortuna offered to pay 2 billion koruna ($118 million) to
2.5 billion koruna for Sazka’s assets, the Amsterdam-registered
company said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday. The move
came after a court sent Sazka to bankruptcy last week.  “This is positive for Fortuna even if the acquisition
fails,” analysts led by Milan Vanicek at Prague-based Atlantik
FT brokerage wrote in a report to clients today. “The
unresolved problems regarding Sazka would make it much easier
for Fortuna to start the lottery and acquire a market share
faster.”  Fortuna has gained 33 percent this month after saying on
May 5 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization rose an annual 44 percent in the first quarter. The
bookmaker has said it will debut lottery operations in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
