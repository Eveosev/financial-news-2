America Movil  SAB filed a motion for
constitutional protection from a $1 billion fine against the
wireless carrier by Mexico’s antitrust agency, Reforma reported
on its  website , without saying where it got the information.  The company argues that Eduardo Perez Motta, president of
the Federal Competition Commission, should have recused himself
from the decision because he had made public comments that
compromised his impartiality in the case, Reforma said today.
Perez Motta cast the tiebreaking vote among the agency’s board
members to issue the fine, the newspaper said.  The Mexico City-based company cited interviews Perez Motta
did with local news media and with Bloomberg Television in
January 2008, the newspaper said. America Movil did request in
March that Perez Motta recuse himself, and while the agency
disclosed on its website that it rejected the request, the
company said it wasn’t legally notified in the appropriate
manner, according to Reforma.  Blanco Lobo Dominguez, the 12th district judge in
administrative matters, will decide the matter, Reforma said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
