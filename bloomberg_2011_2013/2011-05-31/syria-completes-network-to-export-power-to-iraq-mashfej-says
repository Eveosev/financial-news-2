Syria  completed work on a power
network to export electricity to neighboring Iraq and is ready
to negotiate sales contracts, a Syrian government official said.  Syria will test the network for 72 hours before starting
talks, Hisham Mashfej, deputy electricity minister, said in a
telephone interview from Damascus today.  Syria increased power exports by 70 percent to 1.05 billion
kilowatt-hours last year as domestic output increased 7.2
percent to 46.4 billion kilowatt-hours, the Ministry of
Electricity said in a report on May 4.  Iraq asked Syria for permission to join a regional  power
grid  to import electricity from Turkey, state-sponsored Iraqiya
television said March 15. The regional grid connects Syria,
Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan,  Turkey , Egypt, Libya and the Palestinian
territories.  Iraq has been facing violent street protests demanding
improved living conditions and electricity supply.  To contact the reporter on this story:
