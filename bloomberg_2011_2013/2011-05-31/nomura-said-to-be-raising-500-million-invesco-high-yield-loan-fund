Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  is seeking to
raise a $500 million loan fund to be managed by  Invesco Ltd. (IVZ) ,
according to people with knowledge of the deal.  The collateralized loan obligation includes a $330 million
piece rated AAA by Standard & Poorâ€™s, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the terms are private.  CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return.  To contact the reporter on this story:
