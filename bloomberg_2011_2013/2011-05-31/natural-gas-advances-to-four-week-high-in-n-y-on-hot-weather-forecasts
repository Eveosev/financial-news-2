Natural gas futures rose to the
highest price in four weeks as forecasts showed hotter-than-
normal weather, boosting demand for the power-plant fuel to run
air conditioners.  Gas gained 3.3 percent as the  National Weather Service  said
temperatures will be above normal from June 5 to June 9 in the
U.S. East, Midwest and South. The high temperature in New York
may be 88 degrees Fahrenheit (31 Celsius) tomorrow, 13 degrees
above normal, according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,
Pennsylvania.  “This is the beginning of the summer cooling season and
you have the hurricane season coming in too,” said Carl Neill,
an energy consultant at Risk Management Inc. in Atlanta. “I
don’t see a whole lot of downside in prices.”  Natural gas for July delivery rose 14.8 cents to settle at
$4.666 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement price since May 3.
Gas has risen 5.9 percent this year and dropped 0.7 percent this
month.  Gas futures are nearing the upper Bollinger band. Some
traders use Bollinger bands, developed by technical analyst  John
Bollinger , to judge support and resistance levels based on
moving averages. A move above the upper band may trigger
selling.  Air Conditioners  Cooling demand in the U.S. may be 37 percent above normal
from June 6 through June 10,  David Salmon , a meteorologist with
Weather Derivatives in Belton, Missouri, said in a note to
clients today.  Power plants  use about 30 percent of the nation’s gas
supplies, according to the Energy Department.  Scheduled gas shipments to power plants in the Northeast
rose 17 percent today, the most since May 2, to 2.1 million
dekatherms, according to Bloomberg data.  “Traders seem to think that it will be a long, hot
summer,”  Peter Beutel , the president of Cameron Hanover, an
energy advisory company in  New Canaan ,  Connecticut , said in a
note to clients today.  The Atlantic  hurricane season  will be “above normal” this
year with 12 to 18 named storms, the  National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration  said on May 19.  Six to 10 of those storms may become hurricanes and 3 to 6
are likely to become major systems with winds of at least 111
mph (178 kph), the agency said. The Atlantic storm season begins
tomorrow.  Production Report  U.S. natural gas production  rose 3.3 percent in March,
climbing for a second month as onshore output increased, the
Energy Department reported today.  Gas production rose to 77.83 billion cubic feet a day from
a revised 75.33 billion in February, the department’s Energy
Information Administration said in a monthly report known as
EIA-914.  Output in the lower 48 states advanced 3.8 percent to 68
billion cubic feet a day from 65.51 billion, rising for the
first time in three months.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
