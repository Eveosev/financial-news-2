Aquila Resources Ltd. (AQA) , said an
initial study estimated the cost of its planned Eagle Downs
coking joint venture with  Vale SA (VALE)  in  Australia  at A$1.2 billion
($1.3 billion).  The project in Queensland state is expected to produce an
average of 4.5 million metric tons of coal annually from 2016,
Perth-based Aquila said today in a statement. A decision to
develop may be taken around April 2012, it said.  Aquila and Vale have applied to ship coal through proposed
expansions at the Wiggins Island, Abbot Point and Dalrymple Bay
export terminals, with the first being the preferred option, the
company said. Wiggins Island is expected to start shipping in
2014 with an annual capacity of 27 million tons, later rising to
about 80 million tons as part of a second stage expansion.  The feasibility study can’t be completed “due to a lack of
a logistics solution and firm off take arrangements,” the
company said.  Aquila rose 1.7 percent to A$8.49 at 11:28 a.m. Sydney time
on the Australian stock exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
