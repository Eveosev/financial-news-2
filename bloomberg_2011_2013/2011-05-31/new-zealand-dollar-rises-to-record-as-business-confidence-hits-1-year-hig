New Zealand ’s dollar climbed to a
record versus its U.S. counterpart on speculation the nation’s
central bank will raise  interest rates  after a report showed
business confidence increased to a 12-month high in May.  The Australian and New Zealand currencies rose against the
yen as prospects that European nations will give more aid to
 Greece  boosted demand for higher-yielding assets.  Australia ’s
dollar dropped to a three-month low against New Zealand’s after
data showed the bigger nation’s current-account deficit widened
and home-building approvals fell.  “The big news today has been the kiwi,” said Kurt Magnus,
executive director of currency sales at Nomura Holdings Inc. in
Sydney. “ New Zealand dollar  has been outperforming everything.
Business confidence is way up: There’s no doubt that the
emergency rate cut after the earthquake has to get taken off
pretty quickly.”  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, climbed to 82.64
U.S. cents, the strongest level since the currency was freely
floated in 1985, before trading at 82.31 cents at 11:54 a.m. in
 New York , up 0.8 percent. It closed yesterday at 81.63 cents.
The kiwi strengthened as much as 2.1 percent to 67.43 yen, the
highest in a year, before trading at 66.97 yen, up 1.4 percent
from 66.08 yen yesterday.  Australia’s dollar slipped 0.3 percent to $1.0663, from
$1.0691, and appreciated 0.2 percent to 86.74 yen, from 86.53.
The currency dropped 1.1 percent to NZ$1.2952, from NZ$1.3095,
after touching NZ$1.2940, the weakest level since Feb. 2.  Business Confidence  The kiwi gained 1.6 percent in May versus the greenback.  A survey by ANZ National Bank Ltd. today showed a net 39.7
percent of New Zealand’s companies expect their own sales and
profits will rise over the next 12 months, up from 29.5 percent
in April. The net figure subtracts the number of pessimists from
the number of optimists.  The  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand will boost its benchmark
rate by 65 basis points, or 0.65 percentage point, over the next
12 months, a Credit Suisse index showed, compared with a
prediction for 52 basis points of increases a week ago. Policy
makers cut the rate in March to 2.5 percent to spur economic
recovery from the nation’s deadliest earthquake in 80 years.  Australia’s currency fell against New Zealand’s after the
Bureau of Statistics in Sydney said the Australian current-
account deficit increased to A$10.45 billion ($11.21 billion) in
the first quarter from a revised A$8.09 billion. The number of
permits granted to build or renovate houses and apartments
declined 1.3 percent in April from March, separate data showed.  Australia’s gross domestic product shrank 1.1 percent in
the first quarter, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News before the report, due at 9:30 p.m. New York time.  The Aussie and kiwi gained after the Wall Street Journal
reported  Germany  may stop demanding an early rescheduling of
bonds for Greece so the debt-strapped nation can new aid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
