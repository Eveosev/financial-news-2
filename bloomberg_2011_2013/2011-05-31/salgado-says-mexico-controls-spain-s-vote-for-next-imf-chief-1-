Spain’s support for  Christine Lagarde 
in the race to lead the IMF may take a backseat to Mexico, which
is trying to install its own candidate and controls the vote of
the caucus on which Spain sits at the Washington-based lender.  Finance Minister Elena Salgado said Spain backs her French
counterpart Lagarde to be the next managing director of the
 International Monetary Fund . Still, the country shares a voting
chair in the fund with Mexico and other Latin American
countries, with Mexico holding the rotating executive
directorship of that seat, Salgado said.  “We have to separate our presence in a chair, in which the
vote is indivisible,” from Spain’s support for Lagarde, who
would be an “excellent candidate,” Salgado told a news
conference in  Madrid  today.  Mexico and other developing nations are seeking to break a
half-century tradition whereby the top IMF job is reserved for a
European, and Central Bank Governor Agustin Carstens is trying
to win backing for his bid. The IMF said on May 21 it will aim
to pick a leader to succeed  Dominique Strauss-Kahn  by the end of
June and promised to choose the most-qualified candidate from
among front-runners announced by the agency.  To contact the reporters on this story:
