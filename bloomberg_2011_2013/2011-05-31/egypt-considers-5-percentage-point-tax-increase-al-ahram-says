The Egyptian government is
considering increasing taxes on high earners by as much as five
percentage points,  Al Ahram  reported, citing Finance Minister
Samir Radwan.  “We will deal with the progressive taxes issue in a way
that realizes social justice without negatively affecting
investment,” Radwan told the Cairo-based state-run newspaper in
an interview. “We proposed this to the business community and a
big percentage approved of the idea.”  A possible increase in company profits taxes would allow
the government to boost its spending on “social projects,”
Radwan told  Al Ahram .  To contact the reporter on this story:
