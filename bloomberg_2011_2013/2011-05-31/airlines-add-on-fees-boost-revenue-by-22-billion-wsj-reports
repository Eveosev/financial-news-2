Airlines increased revenue by a total
of almost $22 billion last year through adding special fees to
ticket sales, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a study
by Amadeus IT Group SA and IdeaWorks Co.  According to the study, to be released today, 47 of the
world’s biggest carriers, accounting for almost half of global
airline revenue, reported ancillary sales of 15.11 billion
euros, 38 percent more than in 2009, the newspaper said.  Ian Wheeler, who heads distribution and marketing at
Amadeus, an airline-technology provider, told the Journal in an
interview that “ancillary revenue is a growth market” and is
here to stay.  Services formerly included in ticket prices that are now
often charged for include baggage and food; fees for in-flight
Internet connections are another source of revenue, according to
the Journal.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
