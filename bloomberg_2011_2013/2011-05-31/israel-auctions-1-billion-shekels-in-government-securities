Israel’s Ministry of Finance raised 1
billion shekels ($291 million) at debt auctions today, bringing
sales this month to 3.9 billion shekels.  It sold 250 million shekels of bonds due in January 2022
paying a coupon of 5.5 percent, according to data from the
ministry on Bloomberg. The government also sold 200 million
shekels of bonds maturing in September 2013, 250 million shekels
of inflation-linked bonds due in June 2013 and 300 million
shekels of 140-day notes.  “There wasn’t much interest in the auction as prices were
just a little below the market,” Moshik Yaniv, head of the
local fixed-income desk at Migdal Capital Markets Ltd. in  Tel
Aviv , said by telephone. “Demand is high for floating-rate
notes as  interest rates  are expected to continue to rise, which
the ministry didn’t auction this month.”  The government plans to raise 3.9 billion shekels at debt
auctions next month, including 850 million shekels of inflation-
linked bonds and 200 million of floating-rate notes, according
to data on the Finance Ministry website.  The ministry plans to raise 3 billion shekels each in July
and August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
