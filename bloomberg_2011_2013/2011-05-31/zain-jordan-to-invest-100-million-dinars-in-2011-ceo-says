Zain  Jordan , a unit of Kuwait-based
Mobile Telecommunications Co., plans to invest 100 million
dinars ($141 million) in 2011 to develop services, Chief
Executive Officer Abdul Malik al-Jaber said.  “We have 3 million subscribers and this is a 25 percent
increase from a year before,” he told reporters in Amman.
“Our market share is 39 percent, so we are the largest company
in Jordan.”  Zain Jordan invested 150 million dinars last year, mostly
on high-speed packet access wireless Internet, which has lured
350,000 subscribers since it started operations in March, he
said. “We expect the total number of subscribers to reach
500,000 by the end of the year,” he said.  “The future of the industry is moving toward the Internet,
as the mobile market is saturated in Jordan where penetration is
over 100 percent so there is no more room for growth there,” he
said.  Zain Jordan’s investments in infrastructure amount to 700
million dinars since the company started operations in 1995, he
said. “Per year, we provide the Jordanian treasury with about
$100 million, so the total amount since our company’s inception
in 1995 is 1.1 billion dinars,” he said. These are from taxes
and revenue share, he said.  Jordan’s mobile-phone subscriptions rose 10 percent to 6.6
million in 2010, the country’s Telecommunications Regulatory
Commission said on May 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
