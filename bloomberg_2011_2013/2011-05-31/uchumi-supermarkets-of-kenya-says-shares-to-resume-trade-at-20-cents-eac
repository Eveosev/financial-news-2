Uchumi Supermarkets Ltd., a Kenyan
retailer that emerged from bankruptcy, fell as it resumed
trading in Nairobi after a five-year suspension.  The shares slumped as much as 26 percent to 10.80 shillings
before trading 13 percent down at 12.60 shillings by 2.33 p.m.
in the capital, Nairobi. The shares last traded on May 31, 2006,
at 14.50 shillings, according to Bloomberg data.  The company went into receivership in June 2006 with debts
of 2.2 billion shillings ($26 million), of which 957 million
shillings was owed to  Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB)  and PTA Bank
Ltd. The receivership ended on March 4, 2010, after most of the
company’s debts were cleared and others converted into shares.  “There are investors who have been holding the shares for
a long time and want to unlock some money,” Victor Odendo, an
investment manager at Nairobi-based CIC Asset Management Ltd.,
said in a phone interview today. “The biggest beneficiaries are
the debenture holders who got in at 10 shillings and are
unlocking value.”  Yesterday the company said a total of 85.4 million new
shares would be issued today at 10 shillings each. The creation
of the stock will result in the Kenyan government becoming the
biggest shareholder in Uchumi, with a 13.4 percent stake.
Uchumi’s stock was to resume trading at 17.50 shillings each,
the Nairobi-based company said in a statement in the Daily
Nation newspaper.  The new stock will fully convert 498.5 million shillings
issued by the  company  to its debenture holders and partly
convert the government of  Kenya ’s loan of 350 million shillings
and accrued interest into shares, Chief Executive Officer
Jonathan Ciano said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
