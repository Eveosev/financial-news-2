Mauritius’s trade deficit may
increase 25 percent this year, the  Central Statistics Office 
said, as accelerating economic growth draws in imports.  The  trade gap  is forecast at 83 billion rupees ($3 billion)
in 2011, the highest since 2005, the Port Louis-based agency
said on its website today. It was 66.5 billion rupees in 2010.
Imports are expected to advance to 161 billion rupees from 135.4
billion rupees, and exports to 78 billion rupees from 68.9
billion rupees, according to the data agency.  The Indian Ocean island nation’s economy is expected to
grow 4.6 percent, the central bank said on March 28, up from 4.4
percent the previous year. The country is a net importer of
fuels. Textiles and tourism are the main sources of foreign
currency.  “The surge in imports can be a seen as a positive sign, as
demand from consumers and industries increases,” Eric Ng, an
economist and director of the Port Louis-based PluriConseil
Ltd., said in a phone interview. “Companies are accumulating
more stock than before on these grounds”,  The trade deficit widened by 16 percent from a year earlier
in the first quarter to 17 billion rupees, the statistics office
said today. Imports rose 21 percent to 34.7 billion rupees, and
exports jumped 26 percent to 17.8 billion rupees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
