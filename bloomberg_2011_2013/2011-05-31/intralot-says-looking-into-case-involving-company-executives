Intralot SA, the world’s second-
biggest gambling services provider, said its lawyers are
examining a case in which company executives may face
prosecution relating to a contract with  Opap SA (OPAP)  and said an
initial examination doesn’t equate to wrongdoing.  Probes by the European Commission and Greek courts have
showed the “absolute legality” of the contract between Opap
and Intralot, Athens-based Intralot said in an e-mailed
statement late yesterday. The charges are based on a complaint
filed in 2010, according to the statement.  Eleftherotypia  newspaper reported yesterday that Intralot
Chairman Sokratis Kokkalis may face prosecution following
investigation into a technical-services contract between 2005
and 2007. The Athens Court of First Instance district attorney
will investigate the deal, which reached 300 million euros ($432
million) from an initial estimate of 96 million euros, the
Athens-based newspaper said.  “In  Greece , the initiation of prosecution doesn’t amount
to evidence of guilt in relation to the persons involved but on
the contrary it constitutes the initiation of the process for
examining on whether or not any evidence of wrongdoing exists,”
according to the statement.  Intralot shares rose 5.5 percent to 1.73 euros at 11:42
a.m. in Athens trading, after a 22 percent decline yesterday.
The May 30 closing price “does not represent the fundamentals
and financials of the company,” Intralot said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
