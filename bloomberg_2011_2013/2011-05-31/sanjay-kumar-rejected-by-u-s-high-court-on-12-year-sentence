The U.S. Supreme Court refused to
second-guess the 12-year prison sentence imposed on former  CA
Inc. (CA)  Chief Executive Officer  Sanjay Kumar  for leading a $2.2
billion fraud at the software company.  The justices today turned away an appeal by Kumar, 49, who
pleaded guilty in 2006 to charges of conspiracy, fraud and
obstruction of justice. He is serving his sentence at a  federal
prison  in New Jersey.  Kumar argued unsuccessfully that the trial judge used the
wrong version of the federal sentencing guidelines in imposing
the prison term.  He pleaded guilty in 2006 to inflating revenue by
backdating sales contracts. CA, based in Islandia, New York, was
known as Computer Associates International Inc. when Kumar ran
the company.  Prosecutors said Kumar erased his computer hard drive after
being told to preserve evidence for a federal investigation.
Kumar also allegedly authorized the payment of $3.7 million to
silence a potential witness.  The case is Kumar v.  United States , 10-961.  To contact the reporter on this story:
