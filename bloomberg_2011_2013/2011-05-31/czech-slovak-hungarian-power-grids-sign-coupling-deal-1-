The  Czech , Slovak and Hungarian
power-transmission networks, market operators and energy
regulators signed a memorandum of understanding on linking their
markets in the first half of next year, according to OTE AS, the
company that runs the Czech  electricity market .  Linking the already coupled Czech-Slovak area with Hungary
is a logical interim step before integrating the area with the
central western European region, OTE said in a  statement . The
initiative is open to other countries, according to the attached
text of the memorandum.  “The parties declare that their common intention is to
enhance the market integration in the central and eastern Europe
region and to proactively apply market coupling as decided by
the CEE Transmission System Operators and other countries may
access to this congestion management,”  it said .  By connecting countries through the market-coupling process
the efficiency of international cables is maximized. The
European Commission has set a target to achieve complete market
coupling by 2015, gradually bringing prices in neighboring
countries closer together.  The mechanism was in January introduced on a cable between
 Norway  and the Netherlands, while  Germany  was linked with
 France , the Netherlands and Belgium in November. Poland and
Sweden linked their day-ahead power markets through a 600-
megawatt undersea cable in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
