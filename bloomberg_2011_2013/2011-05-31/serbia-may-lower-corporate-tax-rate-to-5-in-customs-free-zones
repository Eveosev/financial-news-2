Serbia  may cut the corporate tax to 5
percent for investors who set up production in a free trade
zone, a  Finance Ministry  official said.  Under a five-year development strategy for the duty-free
areas, the tax authorities plan to trim the rate from 10 percent
for foreign investors who bring their businesses to Serbia, on
condition that  production is intended for export, said Milan
Ristic, the  Finance Ministry ’s director for free trade zones.  “We also consider reducing rates for payroll taxes and
property tax” for export-oriented investors, Ristic said today
in Belgrade after signing a cooperation protocol with the
 Italian-Serb Chamber of Commerce .  Serbia wants to attract investors to boost its post-
recession economy and expected 3 percent growth this year.
Already offering incentives to investors who create jobs and
help narrow Serbia’s trade gap, the country wants to make the
free trade zones particularly attractive and increase their
number to 11 from nine, Ristic said.  The newest is being created in the southern city of Nis, as
asked by  Benetton Group SpA (BEN) ,  Italy ’s largest clothing retailer,
where it bought a former textile factory for 3 million euros.  “Benetton made it a condition that we create a new trade
zone there” before agreeing to take over  Nitex d.o.o ., Ristic
said.  Chairman Luciano Benetton signed the takeover papers today
in Nis, with Serbia’s President  Boris Tadic  attending the
ceremony, as it prepares Serbian production on a 43.2 million-
euro investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
