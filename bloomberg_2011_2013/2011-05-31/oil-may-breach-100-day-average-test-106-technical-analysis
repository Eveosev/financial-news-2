Oil may test $106 a barrel for the
first time in three weeks if it breaks through technical
resistance at its 100-day moving average, according to  technical
analysis  from Blue Ocean Brokerage LLC.  Crude has traded in a range of $95 to $102 after settling
below the 100-day average on May 11. A breach would position the
July contract to rise near $106, a price that corresponds with
both the 50-day moving average and the 76.4 percent retracement
level on a Fibonacci study, said Carl Larry, Blue Ocean’s New
York-based director of energy derivatives and research.  “We’re definitely targeting the 50-day moving average,
which is around $106, as we see new money come in” at the
beginning of June, Larry said. The 50-day average is at $106.17
and the 76.4 percent Fibonacci level is at $106.08.  Crude oil for July delivery gained 36 cents, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $100.59 a barrel May 27 on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . U.S. financial markets were closed
yesterday for the Memorial Day holiday. The contract edged up
0.5 percent last week.  If oil fails to breach the 100-day average this week, it’s
likely to test support at the 50 percent Fibonacci level, or
$95.79, Larry said. Below that, it will look to the 200-day
moving average at $93.89, he said.  Technical analysts use historical chart patterns and tools
such as moving averages to predict potential future price
movements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
