Malaysia’s official selling price for
Tapis oil, a benchmark in the Asia-Pacific region, will fall for
the first time in six months, reflecting a decline in futures.  The low-sulfur crude will sell for $122.71 a barrel in May,
down $4.08, or 3.2 percent, from April, according to a Bloomberg
News calculation using a formula set by state-owned Petroliam
Nasional Bhd. The company known as Petronas will formally
announce official prices retroactively for May shipments later
this week.  Brent crude futures in  London  are down almost 8 percent in
May, set to snap an eight-month rising streak, on concern
 Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis will slow growth and damp fuel
demand. The contract for July settlement on the ICE Futures
Europe exchange today traded above $116 a barrel.  Petronas’s Tapis formula comprises a price-adjustment
factor plus the average of assessments from the Asian Petroleum
Price Index, a Hong Kong-based panel of traders that publishes
prices on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  Kuala Lumpur-based Petronas sells its Labuan and Miri Light
grades at the same price as Tapis, while Bintulu and Dulang are
shipped for 30 cents a barrel less.  To contact the reporter on this story:
