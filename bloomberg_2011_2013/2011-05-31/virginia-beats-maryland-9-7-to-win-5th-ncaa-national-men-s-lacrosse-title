The  University of Virginia  defeated
Atlantic Coast Conference rival University of Maryland 9-7 to
win college lacrosse’s national men’s tournament for a fifth
time in school history.  Colin Briggs scored a career-high five goals as the
seventh-seeded Cavaliers collected their fourth National
Collegiate Athletic Association title under coach Dom Starsia.  “We’re a completely different team than we were six or
seven weeks ago,” Starsia told ESPN in a televised interview.
“This is a team that I would have been really proud of even if
we hadn’t won this game, but the fact that we were able to come
back and win it epitomized the whole season for us.”  Starsia, 59, became the college lacrosse coach with the
most wins with  Virginia ’s 13-9 quarterfinal win over second-
seeded Cornell. Starsia also led the Cavaliers to NCAA titles in
1999, 2003 and 2006.  Yesterday’s game at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore was the
first NCAA final between  ACC  teams since North Carolina beat
Virginia 10-9 in overtime in 1986.  Unseeded  Maryland  has now lost six times in the final since
claiming its second national title in 1975.  The Terrapins led 1-0 after the first quarter on a goal
from Grant Catalino.  Virginia responded with scores by Briggs and Matt White.
John Haus then tied it, and the Terrapins went 3-2 ahead when
Owen Blye scored. Virginia made it 5-3 at halftime with two more
goals from Briggs and one from Nick O’Reilly.  Second Half  In the second half, Briggs made it 6-3 before the Terrapins
rallied to tie it with 11:43 to play with goals from Catalino,
Brian Farrell and Ryan Young.  White got his second goal with 10:03 remaining to restore
Virginia’s advantage and completed his hat-trick with 5:29 to
play to make it 8-6. Briggs got his fifth goal of the game with
1:50 remaining and  Maryland ’s Jake Bernhardt completed the
scoring 16 seconds from the end.  Northwestern University  won the women’s title yesterday,
also by beating Maryland.  College lacrosse may be transformed in coming years after
the  University of Michigan  said May 25 that it will spend as
much as $10 million on men’s and women’s varsity lacrosse
facilities, joining Penn State and the University of Florida as
traditional college athletic powers pouring resources into the
sport.  The interest from state schools -- with their booster clubs,
conference television packages and football revenue -- may
threaten the dominance of private schools such as  Johns Hopkins
University  in Baltimore and Cornell in Ithaca,  New York .  The University of  Florida  spent $15 million on a stadium
and fielded its first varsity women’s team two years ago. The
Gators were ranked as high as No. 2 this season and made it into
the quarterfinals of this year’s NCAA tournament.  Youth participation in the sport increased to 297,271 in
2009 from 125,000 in 2001, according to Baltimore-based  U.S.
Lacrosse .  To contact the reporter on this story:
