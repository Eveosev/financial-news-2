The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign debt fell in  Europe , according to traders of credit-
default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of swaps on 40 companies
with mostly high-yield credit ratings declined 5 basis points to
368, and the Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 investment-grade
companies fell 2.25 to 102, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. A
decline signals improvement in perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments fell 4 basis points to 196, according to CMA.
Contracts on Ireland dropped 18 basis points from a record
closing price to 665, Greece tumbled 54 to 1,396 and Portugal
declined 12.5 to 674.5 while Spain fell 9.5 to 248.5,  Italy 
decreased 4.5 to 162 and Belgium was 5 lower at 149.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers decreased 5 basis points to 156 and the
subordinated index was 8 lower at 255.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.4 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
