Namibia  has banned large scale
jatropha-based biofuel projects in its north east until a study
on its impact is undertaken, according to the country’s
communications ministry.  The southern African nation’s Cabinet recommended a halt to
jatropha in the Kavango and Caprivi regions “due to its negative
impact on  food security , land tenure, and loss of access to
communal land; climate change implications; yield rates; and low
financial viability,” the ministry said today in an e-mailed
statement.  The Namibian government’s study will “determine the
suitability of jatropha plant and other fuel plants” in the
regions, the ministry said. Plantations of up to 400,000
hectares have been proposed by some investors, the statement
said, exceeding the government’s plan of having 63,000 hectares
under cultivation by 2013.  Seed harvested from jatropha trees yields oil that can be
used in the manufacture of biodiesel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
