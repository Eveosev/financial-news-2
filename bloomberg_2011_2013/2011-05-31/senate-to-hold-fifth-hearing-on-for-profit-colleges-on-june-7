U.S. Senator  Tom Harkin , chairman of
the Senate education committee, will hold a fifth hearing on
for-profit colleges on June 7.  The hearing will focus on debt levels among former students
of the colleges, said Justine Sessions, a spokeswoman for
Harkin, an Iowa Democrat. A list of witnesses for the hearing is
forthcoming, she said today in a telephone interview.  The Education Department is preparing to release
regulations that will restrict government aid to for-profit
colleges whose former students struggle to repay their loans.
Harkin’s hearings have focused on the colleges’ recruitment
techniques and their rising share of federal student aid. He has
said he plans to introduce legislation to protect college
students.  “We will not be surprised if this hearing has a decidedly
negative slant on the industry,” Jeff Silber, an analyst at BMO
Capital Markets in  New York , said in a note to clients today. He
has a “market perform” rating on the industry.  Republican members of the Senate committee won’t attend the
hearing because it will examine only for-profit colleges, rather
than public and nonprofit institutions, according to a letter
that Wyoming Senator Michael Enzi, the senior Republican on the
education committee, sent to Harkin today.  “We agree that the rising cost of higher education, student
debt and student outcomes are issues that warrant the attention
of Congress,” Enzi said in the letter. “However, these problems
exist throughout all sectors of higher education.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
