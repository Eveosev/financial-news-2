Israel Corp. rose the most in eight
weeks after the holding company controlled by the Ofer family
said it won’t be affected by U.S. sanctions on affiliate Tanker
Pacific Management ( Singapore ) Pte. Ltd.  The shares advanced 3.1 percent, the most since April 4, to
3,710 shekels at 12:51 p.m. in  Tel Aviv . Before today, the stock
had declined 5.5 percent after the U.S. on May 24 imposed
sanctions on seven companies, including the Ofer Brothers Group,
for conducting business with Iran’s energy industry in ways that
might bolster Iran’s “illicit” nuclear activities.  Ofer Brothers, Tanker Pacific and another company were put
under sanctions for their roles in a September transaction that
provided a tanker to the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping
Lines, according to a U.S. State Department fact sheet.  Separately, the Ofer family said today it “respects”
statements from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Minister
of Defence Ehud Barak yesterday that the government had no prior
knowledge of, or gave permission to, alleged business links
between Ofer-owned companies and  Iran .  The family “disassociates” itself from comments by
“alleged associates to this family affair,” according to an e-
mailed statement from their spokesman’s office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
