Gasoline futures advanced to a two-
week high in  New York  as the euro gained against the dollar on
speculation European officials will approve additional aid to
 Greece  next month.  Prices rose 1.9 percent as the dollar lost 0.7 percent
against the euro as of 2:41 p.m. in New York, increasing the
investment appeal of commodities. The euro gained on optimism
that the additional aid to Greece dimmed prospects for a
sovereign-debt restructuring.  “Today is mostly the dollar being down,” said Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management Institute
in New York.  Gasoline for June delivery rose 5.84 cents to settle at
$3.1504 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . It was the
seventh consecutive gain and highest settlement since May 10.
The June contract expired today.  Futures lost 9.1 percent this month, after reaching $3.4648
a gallon on April 29, the highest level since July 2008, as
refinery outages tightened supplies. The fuel is up 28 percent
this year, the biggest gainer in the GSCI.  The more actively traded July contract gained 1.9 cents, or
0.6 percent, to settle at $3.0503 a gallon.  The Energy Department is scheduled to report last week’s
inventories on June 2, a day later than usual because of
yesterday’s holiday.  Gasoline stockpiles probably rose 800,000 barrels,
according to the median estimate of 11 analysts in a survey by
Bloomberg News. Supplies of diesel and heating oil were likely
unchanged.  Commodity Advance  Gasoline gained as part of a broader commodity advance. The
Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index gained 1.1 percent, with 13
of 19 commodities rising.  “What seems to get the market in the buying mood is the
latest bailout of Greece,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of
research at PFGBest in  Chicago .  On a four-week average, gasoline demand in the week ended
May 20 was 2.1 percent below a year earlier, according to
department data.  Regular gasoline at the pump fell 0.5 cent yesterday to
$3.78 a gallon, the lowest price since April 10, AAA said on its
website.  Heating oil for June delivery added 6.58 cents, or 2.2
percent, to settle at $3.0563, the highest level since May 4.
Prices dropped 6.1 percent this month and have shed 7.9 percent
since reaching $3.3197 a gallon on April 8. The July contract
advanced 5.16 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $3.053 on the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
