Egypt ’s central bank accepted more
bids for repurchase contracts, or repos, at an auction today
than last week after almost meeting its fund-raising target for
treasury bills over the last week.  The central bank accepted 7.58 billion Egyptian pounds
($1.3 billion) in seven-day repo agreements after 6 billion last
week, according to data it published on Bloomberg. The contracts
allow banks to sell  government securities  back to the central
bank to access funds at an interest rate of 9.25 percent.  The North African country’s  Ministry of Finance  raised 10.8
billion pounds in treasury bills at auctions in the past week as
yields stabilized, or 94 percent of its target, compared with 66
percent of its goal in the previous week.  Egypt’s 5.75 percent dollar bond due April 2020 rose,
pushing the yield down four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 5.92 percent at 6:12 p.m. in Cairo. The pound gained
0.1 percent against the dollar to 5.9405, the highest level in
more than two weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
