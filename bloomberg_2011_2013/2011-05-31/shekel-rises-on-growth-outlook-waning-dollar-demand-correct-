The shekel rose to the highest in
more than three weeks and bond yields climbed on bets the Bank
of  Israel  will increase its main lending rate after Governor
Stanley Fischer said the bank may raise its growth forecast.  The forecast for 2011 “is bound to be higher” and “no
doubt 2012 will also be raised,” Fischer said in a speech
today. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
increased its estimate to 5.4 percent on May 25. The
 unemployment rate  fell to 6 percent in the first quarter, the
lowest level in at least two years, as the economy grew, the
Jerusalem-based  Central Bureau of Statistics  said today.  “If Fischer’s forecasts materialize, the central bank will
need to continue to raise borrowing costs, widening the rate
differential with the U.S., which is supportive of shekel
strength,” Adiv Kabiri, senior currency dealer at Gift Asset
Management Ltd. in  Tel Aviv , said by telephone.  The shekel rose 0.5 percent to 3.4335 per dollar at 5:30
p.m. in Tel Aviv. The  Bank of Israel  earlier bought “tens of
millions of dollars,” according to Rony Gitlin, head of spot
trading at Bank Leumi Le-Israel Ltd., after the currency gained
as much as 0.8 percent to 3.4240, the highest intraday level
since May 6.  Rising Rates  The shekel is also gaining as dollar demand wanes on
increased bets  Germany  may stop demanding an early rescheduling
of bonds for  Greece , Kabiri said. IntercontinentalExchange
Inc.’s Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against
those of six major trading partners including the euro and yen,
fell 0.5 percent.  The Bank of Israel raised the benchmark interest rate a
quarter percentage point to 3.25 percent on May 23, the fourth
increase this year. The  Federal Reserve  has said it will hold
 interest rates  at record lows for an “extended period.” Low
interest rates in the U.S. have spurred increased inflows into
Israel and other countries where borrowing costs are higher.  The benchmark Mimshal Shiklit bond due January 2020 fell,
pushing the yield up three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 5.09 percent at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv.  Israel’s Ministry of Finance raised 1 billion shekels ($291
million) at debt auctions today, bringing sales this month to
3.9 billion shekels. It sold 250 million shekels of bonds due in
January 2022 paying a coupon of 5.5 percent, 200 million shekels
of bonds maturing in September 2013 and 250 million shekels of
inflation-linked bonds due in June 2013.  It also auctioned 300 million shekels of 140-day notes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
