New Zealand’s business confidence
rose to a 12-month high in May as record-low  interest rates  and
higher commodity prices bolster the prospect for an economic
recovery from the nation’s deadliest earthquake in 80 years.  A net 39.7 percent of companies expect their sales and
profits to increase over the next year, the highest since May
2010 and up from 29.5 percent in April, a survey by ANZ National
Bank Ltd. released in Wellington today showed. The net figure
subtracts the number of pessimists from the number of optimists.  Confidence has been recovering from the Feb. 22 earthquake
in Christchurch, which caused sentiment to plummet in March by
the most since the global financial crisis in 2008. Exports rose
to a record in April, bolstering the income of farmers and
adding to the case for growth to accelerate later this year.  “The economic patient is beginning to show real signs of
life,” ANZ National Chief Economist Cameron Bagrie said in an
e-mailed statement.  New Zealand ’s dollar, known as the kiwi, was little changed
at 82.31 U.S. cents at 1:10 p.m. after rising to 82.43 cents,
the highest since exchange-rate controls were lifted in 1985.  Rate Outlook  ANZ National’s composite growth indicator suggests the
economy will grow 4.5 percent over the next 12 months, Bagrie
said. The Treasury Department this month forecast growth of 2.5
percent in the year ending June 30, 2012.  A recovering economy adds to signs central bank Governor
Alan Bollard may raise interest rates from a record-low 2.5
percent later this year. There is a 92 percent chance of a
quarter-point increase by December, according to swaps trading
after the release.  A net 15 percent of companies expect to increase investment
in the next year, compared with 6.1 percent in April, today’s
survey showed. A net 13 percent intend to boost employment,
compared with 5.9 percent in the March survey. A net 23 percent
expect higher profits.  The measure of overall confidence in the economy also
rallied, with a net 38.3 percent of the 433 companies surveyed
expecting the economy will improve over the next year, up from a
net 14.2 percent in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
