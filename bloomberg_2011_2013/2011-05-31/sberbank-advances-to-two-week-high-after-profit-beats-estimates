OAO Sberbank jumped to its highest
level in two weeks after the Russian lender’s first-quarter
profit beat analysts’ estimates.  The shares added 0.3 percent to 97.61 rubles, a sixth day
of gains and the highest level since May 16.  Sberbank’s profit doubled to 86.8 billion rubles ($3.1
billion) under international accounting standards, according to
a statement on the website of  Russia ’s largest bank. That beat
the 78.3 billion rubles average estimate for net income from 12
analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
