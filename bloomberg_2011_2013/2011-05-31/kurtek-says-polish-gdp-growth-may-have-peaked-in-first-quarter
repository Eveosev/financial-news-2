Monika Kurtek, chief economist at
Bank Pocztowy in Warsaw, comments on Poland’s first-quarter
economic-growth data, released today in Warsaw.  Gross domestic product expanded an annual 4.4 percent,
compared with 4.5 percent in the previous period, the  Central
Statistical Office  said.  “This is a fast growth pace. It’s not a surprise and
unfortunately is probably the highest rate we will see this
year. The April output data and forecasts for May suggest that
the growth outlook won’t be so bright in the coming quarters. On
top of that, last year’s high growth rate will have a negative
effect on annual growth at the end of this year.  ‘‘First-quarter consumption can only be interpreted as
strong, especially when compared to the previous quarter, when
fear of higher prices spurred  consumer spending .  ‘‘While investment growth is a lot better than in the
fourth quarter, a reading of 6 percent can be regarded as a
decent, moderate pace. Public investments are still the driver,
which means that we still aren’t seeing the pickup in private
investment that the Monetary Policy Council is waiting for. That
also means that we should probably revise any expectations of
better than 10 percent investment growth this year. My forecast
is for 8.5 percent at most.  ‘‘In terms of policy makers, 4.4 percent GDP growth
supports the case for higher rates, while the investment data
argues the opposite. I expect the MPC will keep rates unchanged
in June because they’ll want to wait for the central bank’s new
inflation projection in July.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
