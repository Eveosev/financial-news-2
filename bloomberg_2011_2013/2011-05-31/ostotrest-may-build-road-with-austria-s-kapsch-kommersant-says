OAO  Mostotrest (MSTT) , a Russian
infrastructure builder part-owned by Vladimir Putin’s judo
partner Arkady Rottenberg, agreed with Austria’s Kapsch
TrafficCom AG to bid jointly for construction of a toll road in
southern  Russia ,  Kommersant   reported.  Rottenberg previously partnered with France’s  Vinci SA (DG)  to
build a road from Moscow to  St. Petersburg  via the Khimki
forest, a project which was delayed by a civil environmental
protest, the Moscow-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
