Azerbaijan, the third-largest oil
producer in the former  Soviet Union , agreed to buy the country’s
first communications satellite with U.S. funding and plans to
launch it next year.  AzerSat is being developed by Dulles, Virgina-based  Orbital
Sciences Corp. (ORB)  and will cost $120 million, Deputy Information
Technology Minister Elmir Valizada said in an interview in Baku.
A loan from the U.S. Export-Import bank will cover 85 percent of
the total.  Arianespace, the world’s biggest launcher of commercial
satellites, agreed to lift AzerSat into orbit next year,
Valizada said. If all goes well, Azerbaijan will buy a second
satellite within two years of the first launch, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
