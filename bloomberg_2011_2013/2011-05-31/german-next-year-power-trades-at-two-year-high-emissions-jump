German electricity for next year fell
after earlier trading at its highest price in two years as the
country’s government yesterday confirmed that eight reactors
will remain halted. European carbon permits gained.  Baseload power for 2012 in  Europe ’s biggest market fell 45
cents, or 0.7 percent, to 60 euros ($86.27) a megawatt hour at
5:30 p.m. Berlin time, according to broker data compiled by
Bloomberg. It earlier rose to its highest level since June 2009,
trading at 60.90 euros. Baseload electricity is delivered around
the clock.  Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition won’t allow eight
reactors halted for safety checks and repairs to start, forcing
Europe’s biggest economy to rely on alternative sources and
imports. Seven reactors were shut in March after the nuclear
disaster in  Japan  caused concern about safety. The eighth unit,
Vattenfall AB’s Kruemmel, has been shut since 2009.  Europe’s biggest power market was importing 3,943
megawatts of electricity from France in the hour end at 4 p.m.,
according to data on the website of European grid group Entsoe.
 Germany  was also importing from Scandinavia and its eastern
European neighbors,  Poland  and the  Czech Republic .  European carbon permits for December 2011 rose to their
highest price since November 2008, briefly gaining as much as
7.6 percent on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe exchange. They closed
at 16.99 euros, up 0.6 percent.  Bloomberg tracks power prices from brokers including  GFI
