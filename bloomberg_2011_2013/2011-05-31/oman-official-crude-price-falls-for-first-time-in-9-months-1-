Oman crude’s official selling price
will drop for the first time in nine months in July as refiners
balked at paying more amid slumping processing profits.  The July official selling price for Oman oil will be
$109.20 a barrel, based on the average of daily futures
settlement prices on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange calculated by
Bloomberg News. That’s 6.3 percent less than June’s level of
$116.51 and the first decline since the September 2010 benchmark
price was set. The price reached a record $133.08 in September
2008. Today’s settlement at 12:30 p.m. Dubai time was $109.16.  Premiums for similar Middle Eastern grades for July loading
such as Qatar Marine fell from a high of 43 cents a barrel on
May 20 to a discount of 48 cents today, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Refiners are reluctant to pay as much for
supplies as their profits narrowed over the month.  A decline in gasoil margins has limited the amount of
profit they make from upgrading  fuel oil  to higher value
products such as diesel. The black-white spread, or the price
difference between fuel oil and diesel, rose to $27.50 a barrel
today. That’s still a drop of 18 percent since April 29.  Open interest in the July Oman futures was 10,599 contracts
as of 4:26 p.m. Singapore time, the equivalent of about 10.6
million barrels of crude, or 21 cargoes of 500,000 barrels,
according to Bloomberg data. That compares with open interest of
9,671 at the same time last month.  Oman futures for August delivery rose $1 to $110.27 a
barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 5:19 p.m. Singapore
time, with 80 contracts traded.  Oman crude for immediate loading climbed 91 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $109.89 barrel, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Dubai oil for loading in July rose 0.8 percent to
$109.39. Abu Dhabi’s Murban grade climbed 0.8 percent to $114.31.  The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps for July widened 21
cents to $6.37 a barrel, according to data from PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a London-based brokerage. The exchange for
swaps for August increased 23 cents to $6.23 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
