Danny Faure will be retained as the
finance minister of the Seychelles when a new Cabinet is sworn
in later today, President James Michel said.  Michel plans to retain his existing Cabinet with the
exception of Housing Minister Jaqueline Dugasse who will retire,
his office said in a statement today. Michel, who also heads the
defense, tourism, legal and information ministries, will take
over from Dugasse, it said.  “It is important to maintain continuity in the current
economic climate,” Michel said in the statement. “Major
changes” may happen after a review of the government’s systems.  Seychelles,  Africa ’s smallest nation with a population of
about 89,000, is undergoing an International Monetary Fund-
backed economic reform program that saw the $900 million economy
expand about 6 percent last year, the IMF said March 17. The
Indian Ocean archipelago relies mainly on tourism and tuna
fisheries for its income.  To contact the reporter on this story:
