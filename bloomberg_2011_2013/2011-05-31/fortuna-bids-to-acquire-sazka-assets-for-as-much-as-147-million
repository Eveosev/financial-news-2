Fortuna Entertainment Group NV (FORTUNA) , a
Czech betting company that sold shares last year, offered to buy
assets of bankrupt lottery operator Sazka AS for as much as
$146.8 million.  The offer was made in association with Fortuna’s
controlling shareholder, private-equity company Penta
Investments Ltd., which would give financial help with a
takeover, Fortuna said in an e-mailed statement. The company
sent its bid to Sazka’s administrator, Josef Cupka, yesterday.  The Prague Municipal Court declared Sazka bankrupt after a
meeting with its creditors. Penta said on May 29 that it would
bid for the lottery business as soon as the company was declared
insolvent.  The price bid is based on valuations of Sazka’s logo,
distribution network and licenses, Fortuna said. The final offer
will depend on the “actual” state of Sazka’s assets, it added.  Fortuna, which sold shares to the public in October, is set
to introduce its own lottery program in the coming months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
