The global zinc surplus may decline
after an earthquake and tsunami reduced production and sales at
smelters in  Japan , turning the world’s third-largest economy
into a net importer in April as purchases soared to a record.  Toho Zinc Co., the third-biggest producer, will sell 9.4
percent less this fiscal year, Kunio Yamamiya, representative
senior managing director, said in an interview. The company
joins Mitsui Mining & Smelting Co., the top maker, in reducing
output of the metal used to galvanize steel for the car industry.  The drop in supply may support prices of zinc, which are
trading near their highest level in a month. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. recommended last week that investors buy the metal,
predicting demand will outpace supply next year. Zinc is the
worst-performing metal on the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24
raw materials this year, declining 8 percent as the
International Lead & Zinc Study Group forecasts a surplus.  “Japan’s earthquake will eventually help reduce a surplus
in world zinc supplies and may boost the price as the country
will need more galvanized steel to rebuild,” said Hwang Il Doo,
a senior trader at Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co. in  Seoul .  Zinc will average $2,475 a metric ton in 2011 and $2,500 in
2012,  Michael Widmer , head of metals research at Bank of America
Merrill Lynch in  London , forecast on May 23. Three-month
delivery metal added 0.2 percent at $2,277.50 a ton at 12:17 p.m.
in on the London Metal Exchange.  Surplus Narrows  “Demand growth is outpacing supply growth sufficiently to
tip the market into deficit in 2012,” Goldman said in a May 24
report. “ China  is a growing net importer of zinc raw materials,
setting up for sizable upside for the metal even before
important mine closures are set to take place in 2013-2015.”  World zinc supply will outpace demand this year by 161,000
tons compared with a surplus of 264,000 tons last year,
according to the International Lead & Zinc Study Group. Last
year was the fourth consecutive annual surplus.  “Given the excess in zinc smelting capacity globally, I
believe that the impact would be short lived,”  Gayle Berry , an
analyst at  Barclays Capital  in London, said in an e-mailed reply
to questions from Bloomberg. “The concentrate would most likely
be redirected to other smelters and processed elsewhere.”  The March 11 temblor and tsunami damaged factories,
including metal smelters and refineries, and knocked out power
plants. Toho Zinc said April 12 that it partly restarted
operations at its Annaka smelter, while its Onahama smelter may
resume production in early June. After the quake, it declared
force majeure on raw-material shipments to Onahama.  ‘Production Loss’  Toho Zinc will sell 115,000 tons of zinc in the year
started from April 1, compared with 127,000 tons in the previous
year, Yamamiya said May 27.  Mitsui Mining said April 11 that it will cut output by 16
percent to 92,900 tons in the six months to Sept. 30 from a year
ago, and restart its Hachinohe smelter with a capacity of
112,000 tons in early June.  Toho Zinc’s  Annaka  smelter in Gunma prefecture, north of
 Tokyo , has an annual capacity of 139,200 tons of zinc, according
to spokesman Yasuo Motoishi. The company plans to shut the
Annaka smelter for a month in August for regular maintenance.  “Following the disaster, we may see a production loss of
at least 12,000 tons of zinc ingots,” Yamamiya said. The Annaka
smelter is operating at 30 percent of normal capacity because of
limited supply of processed metal from its  Onahama  plant in
Fukushima prefecture, he said.  Toho Zinc will increase the raw-material procurement rate
from its mines to 73 percent from 35 percent as its unit, CBH
Resources Ltd., plans to start concentrate production from July
2012 at the Rasp mine in New South Wales,  Australia , he said.  Record Imports  The company also plans to raise concentrate output to
85,000 tons this year at its Endeavor mine in the same
Australian state from 68,000 tons last year, he said. Toho Zinc
imports 240,000 tons of zinc concentrate a year.  Japan’s zinc ingot imports reached an all-time high of
31,376 tons in April, compared with 4,053 tons a year earlier,
trade data from the finance ministry show. In March, imports
totaled 3,963 tons versus 578 tons a year earlier. Australia and
 South Korea  were major suppliers to the country in April.  The country’s exports fell 50 percent to 4,190 tons in
April from a year earlier after dropping 35 percent to 7,444
tons in March. In 2010, Japan imported 31,856 tons, while
exporting 97,745 tons.  Toho Zinc, the country’s top lead producer, plans to sell
92,000 tons this fiscal year, compared with 94,000 tons a year
earlier, Yamamiya said. The company is running its  Chigirishima 
lead smelter in Hiroshima at full capacity as demand from
nuclear  power plants  and battery makers has been increasing
after the quake, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
