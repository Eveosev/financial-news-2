The Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corp.
is extending deadlines for planting claims for a second straight
year after wet weather inhibited field work, the provincial
 Agriculture Ministry  said.  Farmers around Kindersley, Rosetown, Leader, Swift Current,
Moose Jaw and Estevan should be able to plant insured crops
until June 20, the Saskatchewan Agriculture Ministry said today
in a  statement  on its website. Other regions may be able to
plant some insured crops through June 15, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
