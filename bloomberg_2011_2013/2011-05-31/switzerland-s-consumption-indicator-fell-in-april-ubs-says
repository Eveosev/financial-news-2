A gauge of Swiss consumer demand fell
in April as  consumer confidence  dropped.  The consumption indicator decreased to 1.58 from a revised
1.68 in March, the Zurich-based bank said today in an e-mailed
statement.  “Consumer sentiment may have been adversely affected by
negative reporting on the European debt problem and the disaster
in Japan,” UBS said in the statement. Fundamentally, the
outlook for consumers is still positive, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
