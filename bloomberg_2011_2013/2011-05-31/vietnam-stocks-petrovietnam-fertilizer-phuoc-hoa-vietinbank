Shares of the following companies had
unusual moves in Vietnam trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the 11 a.m. local-time close.  The VN Index, the benchmark measure of the Ho Chi Minh City
Stock Exchange, gained for a fourth day, rising 2.3 percent to
421.37. The gauge sank 12 percent this month, the biggest
monthly decline since November 2009.  PetroVietnam Fertilizer & Chemical Joint-Stock Co. (DPM VN)
surged by the daily limit of 5 percent to 31,800 dong. The Ho
Chi Minh City-based company plans to buy back 500,000 shares
from June 3 to Sept. 3, it said in an exchange filing.  Phuoc Hoa Rubber Joint-Stock Co. (PHR VN), the country’s
biggest listed rubber company, advanced 1.3 percent to 30,800
dong. Rubber gained, heading for the first monthly advance since
January, on optimism that demand will remain strong in  Japan  and
the U.S. and  China  may increase purchases to replenish
stockpiles.  Vietnam Joint-Stock Commercial Bank for Industry & Trade
(CTG VN), the country’s second-largest listed bank by market
value, increased 2.7 percent to 26,900 dong. VietinBank, as the
company is known, expects its total assets to rise to $70
billion and registered capital to climb to $4 billion by 2015,
Chairman Pham Huy Hung said today.  Total assets were about 367.7 trillion dong ($17.9 billion)
as of Dec. 31, 2010, he said. The bank expects total assets to
rise 20 percent this year, Hung said, without providing a
figure.  --Diep Ngoc Pham in Hanoi. With reporting by Giang Nguyen.
