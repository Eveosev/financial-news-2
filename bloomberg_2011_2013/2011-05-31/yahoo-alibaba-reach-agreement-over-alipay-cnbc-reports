Yahoo! Inc., owner of the largest
U.S. Web portal, reached an agreement with  China ’s Alibaba Group
Holding Ltd. over online-payment business Alipay, Reuters
reported, citing people close to the matter.  The accord requires the consent of Softbank Corp. founder
Masayoshi Son, who sits on the board at Alibaba Group, Reuters
said. Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo, the biggest shareholder
of Alibaba Group, has been negotiating with the Chinese company
over the loss of Alipay.  Yahoo’s shares climbed 3.3 percent yesterday, buoyed by the
Reuters report. The shares had fallen 14 percent since May 10,
when Yahoo said Alibaba had shifted Alipay to a company mostly
owned by Alibaba Group Chief Executive Officer Jack Ma. The
change raised concern that Yahoo’s Chinese assets might lose
value. Alibaba Group, which owns e-commerce businesses in China,
helps Yahoo investors benefit from growth in the world’s largest
Internet market.  Alibaba spokesman John Spelich declined to comment on the
Reuters report. Yahoo also declined to comment on the report in
an e-mailed statement.  “We continue to be encouraged by our discussions,” Yahoo
said in the statement.  Yahoo gained 53 cents to $16.55 yesterday on the Nasdaq
Stock Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
