U.S. nuclear-power production fell 2
percent after  Exelon Corp. (EXC)  shut the Limerick 2 reactor in
Pennsylvania and  Southern Co. (SO)  shut the Edwin I. Hatch Unit 2 in
Georgia, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission reported.  Power generation nationwide decreased by 1,629 megawatts
from May 27 to 81,182 megawatts, or 80 percent of capacity,
according to an NRC report today and data compiled by Bloomberg.
Nineteen of the nationâ€™s 104 reactors were offline.  The 1,134-megawatt Limerick 2 reactor was operating at 100
percent of capacity on May 27. It returned to service on April
23 from a refueling and maintenance outage that began March 28.  The plant is about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northwest of
Philadelphia. Another reactor at the site, the 1,134-megawatt
Limerick 1, is operating at full power.  The 883-megawatt Edwin I. Hatch 2 reactor was operating at
92 percent of capacity on May 27. The 876-megawatt Hatch 1 is
operating at full power at the plant 74 miles west of Savannah.  Scana Corp. (SCG)  started the 966-megawatt Virgil C. Summer
reactor in  South Carolina . The unit is operating at 20 percent
of capacity near Jenkinsville, about 26 miles northwest of
Columbia.  Duke Energy slowed the 846-megawatt Oconee 2 reactor in
South Carolina to 20 percent of capacity from 100 percent on May
27. The plant is located about 30 miles west of Greenville.  Other Oconee Units  Of two other reactors at the site, which also have
capacities of 846 megawatts, Oconee 1 is shut and Unit 3 is
operating at full power.  The Tennessee Valley Authority lowered output from the
1,123-megawatt Watts Bar 1 reactor in Tennessee to 25 percent of
capacity from 92 percent on May 27. The unit, 55 miles southwest
of Knoxville, was shut for refueling April 4.  The TVA boosted the 1,065-megawatt Browns Ferry 1 and the
1,104-megawatt Unit 2 to full power from 88 and 86 percent of
capacity, respectively, on May 27. The Alabama plant powered up
after storms April 27 knocked out parts of the regional
transmission grid.  There was no damage to the plant, located 84 miles north of
Birmingham on Wheeler Lake, near the  Tennessee  line. The 1,115-
megawatt Browns Ferry 3 is expected to resume service after
further repairs to transmission lines.  Byron Output  Exelon increased output from the 1,136-megawatt Byron 2
reactor in Illinois to full power from 27 percent of capacity on
May 27. The unit was shut May 21 to replace a pressure relief
valve. Another unit at the site, the 1,164-megawatt Byron 1, is
operating at 99 percent. The plant is 85 miles west of  Chicago .  Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL)  boosted the 572-megawatt Monticello
reactor in  Minnesota  to 92 percent of capacity from 35 percent
on May 27. The plant, 37 miles northwest of  Minneapolis , shut
for refueling on March 7.  Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG)  raised power from the
1,130-megawatt Salem 2 reactor in  New Jersey  to 100 percent of
capacity from 90 percent on May 27. Another unit at the site,
the 1,174-megawatt Salem 1, is operating at full power.  The plant is about 18 miles south of Wilmington,  Delaware .  Some reactors are closed for maintenance and refueling
during the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating
and cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
