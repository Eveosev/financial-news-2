(Corrects story from yesterday to clarify context of
chairman’s comments in third paragraph.)  Citadel Capital SAE, an Egyptian
private-equity firm, said it had a $241.7 million consolidated
loss for 2010 because two oil-exploration investments are
“underperforming.”  The result fell short of the $12 million average loss
estimate of two analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The Cairo-based
firm had a $28.7 million profit in 2009, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It didn’t release a figure for last year
in today’s statement.  Citadel will continue to focus on its existing investments,
be cautious and “take steps to minimize the economic impact of
the Egyptian revolution” on its investments, Chairman Ahmed
Heikal said today in an e-mailed statement announcing the
results. “Part of this process is the frank admission that two
of our oil exploration platforms are underperforming.”  The firm said it wrote down its units NOPC/Rally Energy and
National Petroleum Co. by 100 percent and 50 percent,
respectively.  The platforms sit on “very substantial reserves, but
ongoing technical challenges” have stalled efforts to bring the
reserves into production, Heikal said.  Total assets under management for Citadel rose by $363.6
million in the year to $4 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
