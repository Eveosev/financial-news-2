Vietnam ’s benchmark five-year bonds
rose on speculation investors added to holdings of the debt
after a drop in interbank lending rates made it cheaper to buy
the securities with borrowed funds. The dong was little changed.  Yields fell from a 30-month high reached yesterday
“following the strong decline in interbank rates, which dropped
to as low as 11 percent from as high as 20 percent early this
month,” said Luu Hai Yen, a Hanoi-based analyst at Thang Long
Securities Joint-Stock Co.  The yields fell five basis points to 12.80 percent, the
biggest drop since May 19, and trimming a rise this month to 33
basis points, according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. Rates are likely to climb further because inflation
is still high, Yen said.  Consumer prices rose 19.8 percent in May from a year
earlier, compared with 17.5 percent in April, according to data
released by the General Statistics Office in Hanoi May 24.
That’s the quickest pace since December 2008.  The dong was little changed at 20,555 per dollar as of 3:34
p.m. in Hanoi, compared with 20,550 yesterday, the same level as
April 29, according to prices from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank set the  reference rate  at 20,643 today,
unchanged from yesterday, its website showed. The currency is
allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the official
rate.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang in Hanoi. Editors: Simon Harvey  To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story:
