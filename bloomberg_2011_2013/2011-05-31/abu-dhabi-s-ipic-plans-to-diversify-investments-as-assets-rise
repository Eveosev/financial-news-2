International Petroleum Investment
Co. plans to diversify its investments into agriculture and
industry as the Abu Dhabi government-backed investor’s assets
under management reached about $58 billion.  "IPIC plans to enter new investments in areas it has not
entered before such as agriculture and industry," Managing
Director Khadem Abdullah Al-Qubaisi said in an e-mailed
statement today. IPIC’s main investment area remains the
 energy industry , he said.  IPIC said last month its plans to build a 200,000 barrel-a-
day oil refinery in Fujairah at an estimated cost of $3 billion.
In February, the company agreed to buy Total SA’s stake in oil
refiner Cia. Espanola de Petroleos SA as part of a 3.97 billion-
euro ($5.37 billion) offer to increase its stake in the Spanish
company to 100 percent.  IPIC’s 2010 profit attributable to shareholders dropped 67
percent to $1.25 billion as costs increased and the company
booked losses from financial instruments, the company said in a
 statement  to the London Stock Exchange. Assets under management
were $47.9 billion at the end of last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
