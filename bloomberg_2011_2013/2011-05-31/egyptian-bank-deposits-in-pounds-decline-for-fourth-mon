Bank deposits  in local currency in
Egypt declined for the fourth consecutive month as the economy
reacts to the impact of the popular uprising that toppled
President  Hosni Mubarak .  Deposits fell to 643.1 billion pounds ($108.3 billion) in
April from 644.7 billion pounds in March, according to  central
bank  data published on its website. Private sector borrowing
declined to 321.3 billion pounds from 321.6 billion pounds,
according to the data. Total domestic credit rose to 879 billion
pounds from 870.5 billion pounds, it showed.  Mubarak resigned on Feb. 11 after 18 days of mass
demonstrations and handed power to a military council. The
turmoil that accompanied the revolt saw tourists fleeing and
factory output hit by strikes. Economic growth may slow to 1
percent this year, the  International Monetary Fund  has said.
That would be slowest growth since 1992, according to IMF data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
