Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  restarted its Line 6B
at reduced rates late yesterday and expects to restart Line 6A
today after a storm caused external power failures that affected
pump stations in  Michigan .  Enbridge’s 283,100-barrel-a-day crude pipeline 6B was
restarted at reduced rates at 10:30 p.m. Mountain time yesterday
after power was restored at a pump station in Marshall,
Michigan, Lorraine Grymala, a company spokeswoman, said in an e-
mail. The line connects Griffith,  Indiana , and Sarnia, Ontario.  “Power utility crews continue working to restore power to
Mendon and Stockbridge stations” in Michigan, said Grymala.
Line 6B, which was shut at 12:30 p.m. on May 29, is expected to
return to full service today, she said.  About 36,000 customers of Consumers Energy in Michigan
remain without power after a thunderstorm swept across the state
May 29, according to Terry DeDoes, a company spokesman.  Enbridge’s Line 6A, which has a capacity of 666,700 barrels
a day and runs between Superior,  Wisconsin , and Griffith, will
start pumping today, according to Grymala. The line was shut at
10 p.m. Mountain time May 29 as the result of full tanks at
Griffith, Indiana.  Lines 4, 67  Line 4, which has a capacity of 795,700 barrels a day and
runs from Edmonton,  Alberta , to Superior, is operating at
reduced rates and will return to normal operations after Line 6A
returns to service, she said.  Line 67, which runs from Hardisty, Alberta, to Superior and
has a capacity of 449,700 barrels, is also at reduced flows and
is expected to return to previously scheduled rates after the
restart of Line 6A, according to Grymala.  The U.S. imported  1.934 million  barrels a day of crude in
the first quarter from  Canada , the biggest U.S. oil supplier,
according to the Energy Department.  Line 17, which has a capacity of 100,600 barrels a day and
runs from Stockbridge, Michigan, to Toledo, Ohio, was also
closed as a result of the Line 6B shutdown, according to
information sent to shippers yesterday obtained by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
