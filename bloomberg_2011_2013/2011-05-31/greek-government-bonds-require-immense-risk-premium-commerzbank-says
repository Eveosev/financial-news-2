Greek government bond yields may
remain near record levels as an extension of aid to the debt-
stricken nation fails to reassure investors, according to
Commerzbank AG.  “Intermediate to longer-term Greek  government bonds  will
require an immense risk premium for the time being,”
Christopher Rieger, head of fixed-income strategy in  Frankfurt ,
said in an interview with  Mark Barton  on Bloomberg Television’s
“On the Move.” “A new deal is likely to carry a maturity of
two to three years so 2013 is still a very key year. I think the
risks are very real that by that time the debt will need to be
restructured.”  Greek debt advanced today after the head of the euro-region
group of finance ministers Jean-Claude Juncker yesterday said a
“definitive answer” to the nation’s debt crisis should be
reached by the end of June.  The Greek 10-year yield dropped 30 basis points to 16.13
percent as of 11:05 a.m. in  London . It climbed to a euro-era
record of 17.10 percent on May 24. The yield on two-year notes
slid 22 basis points to 25.09 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
