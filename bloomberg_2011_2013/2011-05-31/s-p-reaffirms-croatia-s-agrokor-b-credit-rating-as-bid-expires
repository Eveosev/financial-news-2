Standard & Poor’s  Rating Services
reaffirmed Agrokor d.d.,  Croatia ’s biggest company, with a
rating of ‘B’ as its bid for a stake in Slovenian supermarket
chain  Mercator Poslovni Sistem (MELR)  d.d. expired.  S&P affirmed its ‘B’ long-term corporate credit and senior
secured and unsecured debt ratings on Agrokor, the rating agency
said in an emailed statement today. S&P put Agrokor on April 7
on negative watch, saying its interest in Mercator may hurt its
liquidity.  Agrokor was vying against Warburg Pincus LLC and Mid Europa
Partners Ltd. for the Mercator stake offered by  Pivovarna Lasko (PILR) 
Group d.d. Mercator on March 31 called on shareholders to form a
group to sell a majority stake in the largest publicly traded
retail chain in the Balkans. Lasko rejected the bid on May 4.  “The affirmation reflects the expiration of Agrokor’s bid
to acquire a 23 percent in Mercator,” the rating agency said.
It also said it is its “view that Agrokor is unlikely to make a
new bid in the nearest future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
