French  consumer spending  on
manufactured goods fell in April as higher energy costs reduced
disposable income.  Spending dropped 1.6 percent from March, when it fell 0.7
percent, national statistics office Insee said in a statement
today in Paris. Economists predicted a 0.3 percent drop, the
median of 16 forecasts gathered by Bloomberg News showed.
Spending advanced 1.2 percent from a year earlier.  With oil prices up 12 percent in a year, French motorists
are paying more for gasoline, while President Nicolas Sarkozy’s
government has approved electricity-price increases for later
this year. That’s slashing spending power and confidence at a
time when as Sarkozy is cutting government outlays, including
car-sale incentives that ended in March.  “Higher  oil prices  may be squeezing  household income ,”
said Pierre-Olivier Beffy, chief economist at Exane BNP Paribas
in Paris. Car sales are also “down due to the end of the
scrappage scheme.”  A subsidy for new car purchases that was initiated in
December 2008 to counter the recession expired Dec. 31, though
the incentive was still offered to buyers who ordered cars
before the deadline and delayed delivery and payment to the
first three months of this year.  To contact the reporter on this story: Mark Deen in Paris at
