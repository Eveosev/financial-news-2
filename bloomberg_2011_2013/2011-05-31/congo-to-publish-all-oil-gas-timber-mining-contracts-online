The Democratic Republic of Congo will
make all contracts involving mineral, timber, oil and gas
concessions public within 60 days of signing, the government
said.  Documents will be published in the official government
gazette, as well as on ministry websites and in at least two
Congolese daily newspapers, according to a decree signed by the
Prime Minister and Ministers of Environment, Hydrocarbons, and
Mines on May 20. The decree was published on the Mines
Ministry’s website yesterday.  Congo has a third of the world’s cobalt, 4 percent of its
copper, and deposits of gold, tin ore and diamonds. The Central
African country has the second-largest tropical forest in the
world and is in the process of offering licenses for oil
exploration.  Four decades of dictatorship and war destroyed most of
Congo’s infrastructure and devastated its economy. The  World
Bank , which has been pushing for Congo to make its contracts
public to increase transparency in the natural-resource
industry, named the country as one of the most difficult places
in the world to do business in its 2011 Doing Business guide,
ranking it 175 out of 183 nations surveyed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
