Vardhan Dharkar, chief financial
officer at KEC International Ltd.,  India ’s second-largest maker
of power transmission towers, comments on economic growth and
business outlook.  The country’s economy expanded 7.8 percent in the three
months ended March from a year earlier, the government said in a
report today. The median of estimates in a Bloomberg News survey
was for an 8.1 percent increase.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
rose 1.3 percent to 18,470.1 as of 1:41 p.m. in Mumbai.  Dharkar spoke in a phone interview from the city.  “It looks difficult now for India to meet its growth
target of around 8 percent.  ‘‘Slowing down of growth, higher borrowing and raw
materials costs will definitely lead to a slowdown in capital
expenditure in the infrastructure sector.  ‘‘Companies that are planning new projects are most likely
to put them on hold and wait for the macro parameters to ease
out.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
