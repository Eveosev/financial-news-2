Florida Governor  Rick Scott , saying
residents shouldn’t subsidize substance abusers, signed a bill
that will require welfare recipients to submit to drug tests.  Under the  law , applicants for the federal Temporary
Assistance for Needy Families program who test positive for
illegal substances won’t be eligible to receive benefits for one
year or until they successfully complete a substance-abuse
treatment program. More than 113,000 Floridians received TANF
benefits in the last fiscal year.  “While there certainly are legitimate needs for public
assistance, it is unfair for Florida’s taxpayers to subsidize
drug addiction,” Scott, a 58-year-old Republican, said in
remarks prepared for a ceremony in Panama City on the Panhandle.  The House passed the bill in April by a 78-to-38 margin,
and the Senate approved it this month in a 26-to-11 vote.
Republicans have a veto-proof majority in both chambers.  At least 10 states have introduced legislation to increase
drug-screening requirements for welfare recipients. Lawmakers in
at least two,  Arizona  and  Missouri , passed the bills.  Florida ’s law differs because it appears to be the only one
mandating drug tests for all TANF recipients, said  Liz Schott , a
policy analyst at the Washington-based Center on Budget and
Policy Priorities, which focuses on public programs that affect
low- and moderate-income families. Others limit testing to cases
where there is reasonable suspicion that a recipient is using
illicit substances, she said.  ‘Smearing People’  “There’s a world of difference on a practical level and on
a legal level,” she said. “This is about smearing people who
are getting welfare.”  The 1996 Welfare Reform Act gave states authority to test
recipients for illegal drug use, according to a  fact sheet  from
the  American Civil Liberties Union .  Michigan , which was the only
state to implement mandatory drug testing before 2008, scrapped
its law in 2003 after a U.S. district court judge found it
unconstitutional.  The  Florida chapter  of the ACLU is “looking very closely
at the issue and weighing all our options, including a legal
challenge,” said Derek Newton, a spokesman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
