Israel ’s unemployment rate declined
to 6 percent in the first three months of the year, its lowest
level in at least two years, as the economy expanded.  The jobless rate dropped from a revised 6.5 percent in the
previous quarter, the Jerusalem-based  Central Bureau of
Statistics  said today on its website.  “Growth has been rapid,” said Amir Kahanovich, an
economist at Clal Finance Investment Management Ltd. in  Tel
Aviv . “When the economy is growing, there is more demand for
workers and unemployment declines.”  The economy grew an annualized 4.7 percent in the first
quarter, following an expansion of 7.6 percent in the previous
three months, the fastest in four years. The Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development raised its growth forecast
for Israel to 5.4 percent on May 25 and predicted that the
jobless rate would drop to 6.2 percent this year.  Bank of Israel Governor  Stanley Fischer  has been gradually
raising the benchmark interest rate from a record low of 0.5
percent in August 2009, stepping up the pace since the beginning
of the year, as inflation remains above the government’s 1
percent to 3 percent target. Last week, Fischer increased the
rate for the fourth time this year, boosting it by a quarter
percentage point to 3.25 percent.  Israel’s benchmark TA-25 stock index has gained about 17
percent in the past 12 months, led by Israel Corp., a holding
company with interests in shipping and chemicals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
