Gold futures rose for the second
straight session as the dollar’s decline and  Europe ’s debt woes
spurred demand for an alternative investment.  The greenback fell to the lowest in almost three weeks
against six major currencies. Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean- Claude Juncker said European leaders will decide on additional
aid for Greece by the end of next month and have ruled out a
“total restructuring” of the nation’s debt. Russia and Mexico
raised gold reserves in April, International Monetary Fund data
show.  “The weaker dollar sentiment is creating a positive metal
sentiment,”  James Moore , an analyst at TheBullionDesk.com in
London, said today in a report. Gold continues “to benefit from
investment and physical buying as the threat of peripheral euro-
zone default intensifies.”  Gold futures for August delivery rose $2, or 0.1 percent,
to $1,539.30 an ounce at 11:25 a.m. on the Comex in  New York .
The price climbed 0.9 percent on May 27. Floor trading was
closed yesterday for a U.S. holiday.  Accelerating inflation and fighting in Libya helped drive
gold to a record $1,577.40 on May 2. The  Federal Reserve  has
kept its benchmark rate at zero percent to 0.25 percent since
December 2008 and pledged to buy $600 billion in U.S. Treasuries
through the end of June to help revive the  U.S. economy .  “The market currently believes that the Fed will end its
quantitative-easing program on June 30, but will reinvest the
proceeds and maintain the size of its balance sheet,” said Tom Pawlicki, an analyst at MF Global Holdings Ltd. in Chicago.
“Such a delay in normalizing policy could be seen as positive
for precious metals.”  Russia raised its  gold reserves  by 13.72 metric tons in
April to 824.83 tons, according to IMF data. Mexico increased
its holdings by 5.93 tons to 106.14 tons.  Silver futures for July delivery rose 55.7 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $38.42 an ounce. This month, the metal has tumbled
more than 20 percent, the most since August 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:
