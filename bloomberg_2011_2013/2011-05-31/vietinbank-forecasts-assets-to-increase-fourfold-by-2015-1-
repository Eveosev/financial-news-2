Vietnam Joint-Stock Commercial Bank
for Industry & Trade, the country’s second-largest lender by
market value, expects total assets to surge fourfold by 2015 as
it raises more funds to expand its operations.  Assets will rise to $70 billion from $17.9 billion at the
end of 2010, Chairman Pham Huy Hung said. The lender also
expects assets to rise to 441 trillion dong ($21 billion) in
2011, he said at a meeting with shareholders in Hanoi today.  Pretax profit of the Hanoi-based lender, known as
VietinBank, may increase 11 percent to 5.1 trillion dong in
2011, Hung said. The bank also plans to sell $500 million to $1
billion of bonds in the second half, Le Duc Tho, deputy general
director, said in an interview today.  “We expect to sell the bonds in late third quarter or
early fourth quarter,” Tho said. “The international market is
a potential channel for capital mobilization, helping VietinBank
to supplement medium and long-term funding and contributing to
plans for the growth of total assets and expanding credit and
investment activities.”  Shares of VietinBank rose 2.7 percent to 26,900 dong at the
11 a.m. close at the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange, the
country’s main bourse. The stock climbed 17 percent this year,
compared with a 13 percent decline in the benchmark VN Index.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang in Hanoi. Editors: Linus Chua, Chitra
