South African Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said the country is still considering whether to
nominate a candidate to head the  International Monetary Fund  in
consultation with other developing nations.  The European Union is backing French Finance Minister
 Christine Lagarde  as the next IMF managing director, which has
historically gone to a European. Emerging-market countries,
which are challenging the status quo, have yet to agree on a
candidate to replace Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who stepped down
this month to contest sexual-assault charges.  “We are all very aware of the fact that we require
consensus among ourselves and we require a consultative
process,” Gordhan told reporters in Cape Town today. “We have
until June 10. It’s work in progress. We are talking about a
shift from an entitlement to heading certain institutions to a
more democratic process.”  While Gordhan’s predecessor,  Trevor Manuel , has been named
as a possible candidate for the job, he has yet to say that he
is willing to accept the position. Gordhan declined to say
whether Manuel was being considered as a nominee, saying it was
President Jacob Zuma’s prerogative to decide on a candidate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
