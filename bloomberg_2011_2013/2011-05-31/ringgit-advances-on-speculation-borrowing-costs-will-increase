Malaysia’s ringgit gained for a
fourth day, trimming a monthly decline, on speculation the
central bank will raise  interest rates  or tolerate currency
gains to help damp inflation as power prices rise.  The government approved a 7.1 percent increase in average
electricity charges from tomorrow to help claw back state
subsidies. The move will boost consumer prices in  Southeast
Asia ’s third-largest economy, Citigroup Inc. said. The ringgit
also advanced on optimism European officials will sanction more
financial aid to  Greece . Bonds fell in May as faster inflation
eroded demand.  “With more price pressure, the market sees some certainty
in either a stronger ringgit or a rate hike in the coming
month,” said D. Sivadass, a foreign-exchange forwards trader at
EON Capital Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “We have a positive backdrop
in  Europe  that the Greece crisis will not get out of hand.”  The ringgit gained 0.3 percent to 3.0115 per dollar as of
4:13 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency declined 1.5 percent in May, snapping a
five-month rally.  The government said yesterday it will allow power
distributor Tenaga Nasional Bhd. to raise electricity prices for
the first time in three years as state-owned oil company
Petroliam Nasional Bhd. reduces gas subsidy to power generators.  Inflation in June may be between 3.7 percent and 3.8
percent, supporting another 25-basis point increase in the
policy rate in July, Citigroup analysts Kit Wei Zheng and Brian
Tan wrote in a report.  Consumer prices rose 3.2 percent from a year in April, the
most in two years.  Bank Negara Malaysia  raised its overnight
policy rate to 3 percent from 2.75 percent on May 5, saying
growth remained steady and inflation will quicken. Policy makers
next meet to decide on interest rates on July 7.  Five-year notes completed a first monthly loss since the
government sold more of the securities in March.  The yield on the 4.262 percent note maturing in September
2016 increased four basis points, or 0.04 percentage points, to
3.58 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia. The price dropped
0.25, or 2.5 ringgit per 1,000 ringgit face amount, to 103.25.  The government raised 7.5 billion ringgit from the sales of
2016 and 2017 notes this month, taking this year’s proceeds to
43.5 billion ringgit versus 24.5 billion ringgit at the same
time last year, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
