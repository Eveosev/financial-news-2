Fitch Ratings  confirmed its top AAA
ratings on France’s euro and foreign-currency borrowing and said
its outlook is “stable,” while warning that the government
needs to control the growth of its debt.  The Fitch report cited the country’s “wealthy and
diversified economy” and its “effective political, civil, and
social institutions.” It also noted government efforts to cut
the debt, such as last year’s increase in the  retirement age  and
a draft law calling for balanced budgets.  “However, continued fiscal consolidation is needed to
stabilize and then start to reduce public debt, which reached
81.7 percent of GDP as of end-2010,” Maria Malas-Mroueh, a
director in Fitch’s sovereign team, said in the statement
published in  London  today.  Fitch said it doesn’t envisage any changes to its ratings
of French banks as a result of their exposure to Greek debt,
adding that the banks have “very limited direct exposure” to
Portuguese and Irish risk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
