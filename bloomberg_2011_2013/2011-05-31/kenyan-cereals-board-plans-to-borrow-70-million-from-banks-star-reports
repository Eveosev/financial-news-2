Kenya ’s National Cereals and Produce
Board plans to borrow 6 billion shillings ($70 million) from
banks to fund its operations instead of relying on government
funding, The Star reported.  Kenya’s government owes the board 5 billion shillings for
services delivered over the past five years, the Nairobi-based
newspaper said. The agency will continue to carry out work for
the government, including distributing relief food, purchasing
and storing cereals for the Strategic Grain Reserve and buying
and distributing farm inputs including fertilizer, the Star
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
