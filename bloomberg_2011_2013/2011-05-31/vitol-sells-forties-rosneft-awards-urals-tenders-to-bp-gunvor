Vitol Group sold  North Sea  Forties
crude at a lower price for the second session. No bids or offers
were made for Urals in northwest Europe and the Mediterranean.  OAO Rosneft awarded Urals crude tenders for seven cargoes
totaling 700,000 metric tons loading in June from the Baltic Sea
port of Primorsk to BP Plc and Gunvor International BV.  North Sea  Vitol sold one shipment of Forties crude for June 19 to
June 21 to Statoil ASA at 20 cents a barrel below the cash cost
of North Sea crudes for July, compared with a discount of 10
cents for a cargo it sold May 27, according to a survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Platts trading window.  Reported North Sea market activity typically occurs during
the Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before
the window, Forties loading in 10 to 21 days cost 20 cents more
than Dated Brent, compared with 31 cents on May 27, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for July settlement traded at $116.84 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange at the close of the
window, up from $114.71 yesterday. The August contract was at
$116.52, 32 cents less than July.  BP will shut the North Sea Forties Pipeline System from
Aug. 1 to Aug. 5 for planned maintenance and the removal of an
unexploded World War II mine found in March.  Daily production of Forties will rise about 16 percent in
September to an average of 461,000 barrels from a revised
forecast for 399,000 barrels in August, BP said in a forecast on
its website.  The share of Buzzard crude in the Forties blend fell to 17
percent last week, from 18 percent in the period to May 22, the
London-based company said.  Statoil said production at the Njord oil field in the
 Norwegian Sea  partly resumed in mid-May.  Mediterranean/Urals  Rosneft awarded BP five Urals cargoes and Gunvor two, said
two traders who participate in the market.  Sytrol,  Syria ’s state-run oil company, cut the official
selling price of its Souedie crude for June loading by 25 cents
a barrel, a company official said.  Souedie, also known as Syrian Heavy, will be priced at
$13.25 a barrel below the Dated Brent benchmark, compared with a
discount of $13 for May, the official said today. He declined to
be identified, citing company policy.  West Africa  The Republic of the Congo plans to export seven cargoes of
920,000 barrels of Djeno crude in July, one more than June,
according to loading programs obtained by Bloomberg News.  The country will also ship three 950,000-barrel
consignments of its N’Kossa grade for July, compared with two
next month, the plans showed.  Daily output of Ghana’s Jubilee crude may rise to 120,000
barrels by July from the current 70,000 barrels, said Dai Jones,
the president and general manager of operator Tullow Ghana Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
