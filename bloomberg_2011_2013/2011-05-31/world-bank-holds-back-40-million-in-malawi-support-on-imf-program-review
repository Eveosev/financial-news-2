The  World Bank  is holding back $40
million in budget support to Malawi because the country hasn’t
completed the review of its program with the  International
Monetary Fund , the Daily Times reported, citing the bank’s
country manager.  The lender is waiting for a review of reforms to help
address persistent external economic imbalances, the Blantyre-
based newspaper cited Sandra Bloemenkamp, the World Bank’s
manager for Malawi, as saying. The money is for the budget for
the fiscal year through June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
