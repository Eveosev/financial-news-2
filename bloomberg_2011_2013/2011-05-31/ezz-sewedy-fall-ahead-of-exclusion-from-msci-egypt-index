Ezz Steel (ESRS) ,  Egypt ’s biggest publicly
traded manufacturer of the metal, fell the most in more than a
month ahead of its exclusion from the  MSCI Egypt (MXEG)  Index. El
Sewedy Electric Co., the other stock to be dropped, lost for the
first time in six days.  Ezz Steel plunged 6.9 percent, the most since April 26, to
9.86 Egyptian pounds at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo. El Sewedy,
the country’s biggest publicly traded cables manufacturer, fell
3.2 percent, the most in almost two weeks, to 38.23 pounds.
Egypt’s benchmark EGX 30 Index retreated 1.2 percent.  The two companies will be left out of the MSCI Egypt Index
as of the end of trading today, MSCI said in a release on its
website on May 16. The move will reduce the number of members of
the index to nine, according to Bloomberg data.  “Investors are anticipating an increase in selling
pressure on both stocks after they are dropped by MSCI,” said
Ashraf Akhnoukh, senior equity sales trader at Cairo-based
Commercial International Brokerage Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
