Counterfeit alcohol served on a
cruise from the Turkish vacation town of Bodrum led to the
hospitalization of 30 Russian tour guides and killed one of
them,  Vatan  newspaper reported.  The guides, who work for travel company Mostravel, departed
for the company-organized cruise on May 26, Vatan said. Many
became ill while on board, and 15 who were in critical condition
were taken by medical jet to the Akdeniz University hospital in
Antalya, it said.  Three of the passengers remain hospitalized with their
lives in danger, Vatan said. Police arrested the owner of the
boat and four workers, it said.  Doctors said the poisoning was from highly toxic methanol,
or methyl alcohol, Vatan said, which is difficult to
differentiate between the ethanol alcohol used in beverages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
