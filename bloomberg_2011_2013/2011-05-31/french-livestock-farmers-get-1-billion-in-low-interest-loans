Credit Agricole SA (ACA) ,  France ’s third-
largest bank by market value, is offering livestock farmers 700
million euros ($1 billion) in low-interest loans as some regions
contend with the worst drought in a half century.  The loans will allow farmers to buy straw and feed before
they get advance payments from the European Union’s Common
Agricultural Policy in October, the bank said in an e-mailed
statement today. Interest rates will range from 1.5 percent to 2
percent, depending on the age of the farmer, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
