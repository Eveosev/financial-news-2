AT&T Inc. (T) ,  Intel Corp. (INTC)  and  Cisco
Systems Inc. (CSCO)  said Congress should pass legislation “this year”
to let regulators auction airwaves voluntarily relinquished by
television stations.  More airwaves would make it easier to extend mobile high-
speed Internet service, the companies said in a letter today to
leaders of Senate and House commerce committees. The letter,
with 33 signatory companies, was distributed by CTIA-the
Wireless Association, a Washington-based trade group.  The administration of President Barack Obama backs the
auctions, which can’t take place without legislative approval.
Congress hasn’t acted. Broadcasters have raised concerns about
whether the auctions will be truly voluntary.  The auctions are to be the topic of a hearing tomorrow
before the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s Subcommittee on
Communications and Technology.  To contact the reporter on this story:
