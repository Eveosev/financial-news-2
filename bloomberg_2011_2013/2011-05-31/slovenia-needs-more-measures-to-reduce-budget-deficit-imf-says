Slovenia must spell out and implement
additional measures to narrow its budget deficit, the
 International Monetary Fund  said in an annual review of the
country’s economy.  “Directors emphasized the need to keep the recovery on
track, safeguard the sustainability of public finances, enhance
financial sector resilience, and strengthen competitiveness,”
the IMF said after a May 20 board meetings whose conclusions
were released today.  The country’s budget shortfall will widen to 5.8 percent of
gross domestic product this year, from 5.6 percent in 2010, with
debt rising to 42.8 percent of GDP from 38 percent, the European
Union estimated May 13. By comparison, the Greek deficit will
narrow to 9.5 percent from 10.5 percent, and its debt will
increase to 158 percent from 143 percent, the EU forecasts.  The Washington-based IMF said the role of changes in the
pension system is “crucial” and that Slovenia needs additional
measures to what has been announced, which “will likely fall
short in generating the needed savings in the long run.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
