U.S. corn, soybean and spring-wheat
planting trailed the year-earlier pace last week, after wet
weather in the eastern Midwest and northern regions inhibited
fieldwork.  About 86 percent of the corn crop, the worldâ€™s biggest, was
planted as of May 29, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said
today in a report. That compares with 79 percent a week earlier
and 97 percent a year earlier. The average was 95 percent at
this time of year, from 2006 to 2010.  Soybean planting was 51 percent complete, compared with 41
percent a week earlier, 71 percent a year earlier and the five-
year average of 71 percent. About 68 percent of the spring-wheat
crop was seeded, compared with 54 percent a week earlier and an
average 95 percent for the past five years, the department said.  The cotton crop was 73 percent planted, compared with 57
percent a week earlier and 77 percent a year earlier, the USDA.
The five-year average is 76 percent.  About 44 percent of the winter-wheat crop was in very poor
or poor condition, compared with 45 percent a week earlier and 9
percent a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
