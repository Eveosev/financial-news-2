Peru’s sol headed for its strongest
monthly gain in more than 1 1/2 years as Congresswoman Keiko Fujimori maintained her lead over former army rebel Ollanta Humala in an opinion poll before a June 5 presidential runoff.  The sol strengthened 0.2 percent to 2.7680 per  U.S. dollar 
at 1:12 p.m.  New York  time, from 2.8265 on April 30. That brings
the currency’s gain to 2.1 percent this month, the biggest
monthly advance since September 2009.  Fujimori led Humala by 4.1 percentage points in a poll
published May 29 by Datum Internacional. She trailed Humala by 8
percentage points in the first round of elections April 10.
Humala, a one-time ally of Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez ,
pledges to revise agreements with trading partners including the
U.S. and change the constitution to strengthen the state’s role
in the economy.  “You’ve had a very strong recovery that has taken the sol
to levels of appreciation unexpected before the presidential
race went through balloting,” said  Enrique Alvarez , head of
Latin American fixed-income research at IDEAglobal in New York.
“It’s all poll related. Keiko Fujimori’s advantage has become
steadier in the overall view of investors. She’s been able to
reverse the trend, and it seems that she should come out
ahead.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
