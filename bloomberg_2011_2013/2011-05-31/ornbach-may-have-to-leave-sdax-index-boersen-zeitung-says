Hornbach Holding AG (HBH3)  will probably
have to leave  Germany â€™s SDAX stock index of small companies as
trading volume is too small, Boersen-Zeitung reported, citing
Silke Schluensen, an analyst at Close Brothers Seydler Bank.  Hornbach, a Neustadt, Germany-based retailer of building
materials, will most likely be replaced by GSW Immobilien AG
when the index membership is revised on June 20, the newspaper
said today, citing Anke Platzek, an analyst at Landesbank Baden-
Wuerttemberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
