Sierra Leone’s government has signed
a $750 million agreement with Joule Africa to complete a hydro-
electric power project,  Agence France-Presse said , citing
Patrick Beckley, a company spokesman.  The Bumbuna hydro-electric project in the north of the
country was started in 1975 and stopped during Sierra Leone’s
civil war, AFP said. The first phase of the project was
completed in 2009, supplying 50 megawatts of electricity, the
 news agency  said.  The company plans to complete the 400 megawatt project in
five years, tripling the country’s power production by 2017, AFP
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
