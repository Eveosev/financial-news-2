German stocks fell the most in a week
amid slowing European and Chinese manufacturing and after a
private report showed companies in the U.S. added fewer workers
than forecast to payrolls last month.  Bechtle AG (BC8)  retreated 7.7 percent after BWK GmbH said it
will sell shares in the computer and software retailer.  Q-Cells
SE (QCE)  and  Nordex SE (NDX1)  snapped two days of gains. ThyssenKrupp AG and
Salzgitter AG dropped with metal prices.  Medion AG (MDN)  jumped the
most in 8 1/2 years after Lenovo Group Ltd.,  China ’s biggest
maker of personal computers, offered to buy the company.  The benchmark  DAX Index (DAX)  decreased 1.1 percent to 7,217.43
at the 5:30 p.m. close in Frankfurt. The gauge rallied 1.9
percent yesterday after  Jean-Claude Juncker  said European Union
leaders will decide on additional aid for  Greece  by the end of
June and have ruled out a “total restructuring” of the
nation’s debt. The broader  HDAX Index (HDAX)  dropped 1 percent today.  “Macroeconomic risks matter today,” said Daniel Weston, a
Munich-based portfolio adviser at Schroeder Equities GmbH.
“Poor manufacturing and employment data have finally put
pressure on equity markets which had been resilient to bad news
in the past week.”  A gauge of manufacturing in the 17-nation euro area slipped
to 54.6 in May from 58 in April, London-based Markit Economics
said today. That’s below an initial estimate of 54.8 released on
May 23. A reading of more than 50 indicates growth.  Chinese Economy  China’s manufacturing expanded at the slowest pace in nine
months in May as the government extended a campaign to cool
inflation and the  property market .  German stocks extended declines as U.S. employment
increased by 38,000 last month, the smallest gain since
September, from a revised 177,000 in April, according to figures
from ADP Employer Services. The median estimate in the Bloomberg
News survey called for a 175,000 advance for May. A separate
report showed manufacturing in the U.S. expanded in May at the
slowest pace in more than a year.  Bechtle slumped 7.7 percent to 28.68 euros, the largest
drop since September 2009. BWK said it will offer as many as 3.9
million Bechtle shares at 29 euros apiece to institutional
investors.  Q-Cells slid 12 percent to 1.82 euros, while Nordex
declined 5.3 percent to 6.75 euros. Alternative-energy stocks
had rallied for two days as German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
coalition set 2022 as the final date to close the country
nuclear reactors, making  Germany  the largest nation to abandon
atomic power.  Steelmakers Slip  ThyssenKrupp and Salzgitter, Germany’s biggest steelmakers,
fell 1.3 percent to 32.57 euros and 2.3 percent to 50.16 euros,
respectively. Aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc all
retreated on the London Metal Exchange.  Medion soared 18 percent to 13 euros, the largest advance
since October 2002. Lenovo offered to buy the consumer-
electronics company for 466 million euros ($671 million) in its
biggest acquisition since the purchase of International Business
Machines Corp.’s PC business more than six years ago.  GSW Immobilien AG gained 1.9 percent to 22.85 euros, the
highest price since the company’s initial public offering in
April. The German real-estate company that sold shares to the
public for the first time in April plans to pay a dividend of at
least 90 cents a share for this year, Boersen-Zeitung said,
citing Chief Financial Officer Andreas Segal.  Separately, Commerzbank initiated coverage of the stock
with a “buy” rating and a price estimate of 26.50 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
