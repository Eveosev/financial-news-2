Peru’s sol posted its strongest
monthly gain in more than 1 1/2 years as Congresswoman Keiko Fujimori maintained her lead over former army rebel Ollanta Humala in an opinion poll before a June 5 presidential runoff.  The sol strengthened 2.1 percent this month, including a
0.2 percent gain today, to 2.7694 per  U.S. dollar  from 2.8265 on
April 30. It was the currency’s biggest monthly advance since
September 2009.  Fujimori led Humala by 4.1 percentage points in a poll
published May 29 by Datum Internacional. She trailed Humala by 8
percentage points in the first round of elections April 10.
Humala, a one-time ally of Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez ,
pledges to revise agreements with trading partners including the
U.S. and change the constitution to strengthen the state’s role
in the economy.  “You’ve had a very strong recovery that has taken the sol
to levels of appreciation unexpected before the presidential
race went through balloting,” said  Enrique Alvarez , head of
Latin American fixed-income research at IdeaGlobal in  New York .
“It’s all poll related. Keiko Fujimori’s advantage has become
steadier in the overall view of investors. She’s been able to
reverse the trend, and it seems that she should come out
ahead.”  Concern that Humala, who topped the field in the first
round of elections April 10, will win the presidential vote and
slow the region’s fastest-growing economy led investors to dump
Peruvian assets last month, causing the sol to fall to a 10-
month low of 2.8384 per dollar on May 2.  Fujimori Support  The sol rose to a 3-year high of 2.7454 on May 26 after
polls showed stronger support for Fujimori, who pledges to keep
the $153 billion economy open to foreign investment.  Peru ’s central bank bought dollars May 23 for the first
time in more than three months to slow the sol’s advance. The
bank didn’t buy dollars today, it said on its website.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell three basis points today,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 6.70 percent, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The bond’s yield dropped 43 basis points
this month, the steepest decline in 10 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
