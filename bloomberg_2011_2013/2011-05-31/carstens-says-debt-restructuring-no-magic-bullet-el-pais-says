Debt restructurings for countries
like Greece are no “magic bullet” and should only be
undertaken as a last resort and as one step amongst a range of
others, Agustin Carstens, governor of the Bank of  Mexico , said
in an interview with Spain’s El Pais newspaper.  In comments about his bid to lead the  International
Monetary Fund , Carstens told the newspaper he believes he can
attract the support of a “good part” of the emerging nations.
While he faces a “difficult process” in ending a tradition of
IMF leadership by Europeans, Carstens told El Pais it was time
that the role of emerging nations in the international economy
was recognized.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
