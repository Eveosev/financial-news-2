Scania AB (SCVB) , the Swedish truckmaker
controlled by  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , said it obtained a 1 billion-euro
($1.4 billion) loan to refinance existing debt.  The revolving-credit facility has a maturity of five years
with two one-year extension options and will be used to
refinance a loan of the same size coming due next year,
coordinator  Nordea Bank AB (NDA)  said in an e-mailed statement.  VW began a public takeover bid for German truckmaker  MAN SE (MAN) 
as  Europe ’s largest carmaker seeks a partner for its Scania
division in manufacturing commercial vehicles. A merger of the
van divisions would put Wolfsburg, Germany-based VW in control
of Europe’s largest truckmaker, surpassing its Volvo AB and
Daimler AG rivals.  VW took a controlling stake in Soedertaelje, Sweden-based
Scania in 2008. The truck maker rose 1.3 percent to 151.6 kronor
as of 12:37 p.m. in  Stockholm .  BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup Inc., Danske Bank A/S, Deutsche
Bank AG, DNB NOR Bank ASA, Svenska Handelsbanken AB, HSBC
Holdings Plc, ING Groep NV, Morgan Stanley, SEB AB, Swedbank AB
and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc also helped arrange the
loan, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
