Shares of the following companies had
unusual moves in U.S. trading. Stock symbols are in parentheses
and prices are as of 4 p.m. in  New York .  American Superconductor Corp. (AMSC)   plunged 24 percent
to $8.11, the biggest decline in the  Russell 2000  Index. The
maker of wind-turbine components and transmission lines delayed
filing its annual report, saying it needed time to review
revenue from shipments to  China  and expects to exclude a
“material amount” of revenue that had been included in its
sales estimate for the fiscal year ended in March.  Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG)   dropped 7.9 percent, the most
since March 8, to $10.79. The Houston-based liquefied-natural-
gas company said it will sell 8.7 million shares in a public
offering.  Daktronics Inc. (DAKT)   rose 9.2 percent, the most since
Nov. 17, to $11.74. The maker of Times Square video displays and
other electronic billboards reported fourth-quarter earnings and
sales that beat analysts’ estimates  Dollar General Corp. (DG)   sank 9.3 percent, the second
biggest drop in the Russell 1000 Index, to $31.81. The largest
U.S. dollar-store chain reported first-quarter profit that
missed analysts’ estimates, hurt by rising gasoline prices.  Supermarket chains  Safeway Inc. (SWY)   and  Supervalu Inc. (SVU) 
 also slumped, declining 6.2 percent to $23.16 and 6.4
percent to $9.60 respectively.  Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc. (JOSB US) slumped 13 percent,
the most since September 2008, to $49.51. The maker of men’s
apparel posted first-quarter profit of 64 cents a share, missing
the 66-cent average analyst estimate.  Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR)   slumped 9.9 percent to
$32.97, the biggest decline in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.
The network equipment maker’s Chief Executive Officer  Kevin
Johnson  indicated at a Bank of America Corp. conference that
“the quarter is back-end loaded,” fanning concern that results
will be worse than investors anticipated, according to Michael Genovese, an analyst at MKM Partners LLC.  Orexigen Therapeutics Inc. (OREX)   rallied 18 percent to
$3.34, the second-biggest gain in the Russell 2000. The
developer of a prescription diet pill said it will provide a
regulatory update on its Contrave on June 3.  SkyPeople Fruit Juice Inc. (SPU)   plunged 18 percent to
$2.08, the lowest price since October 2008. The Xi’an, China-
based fruit juice producer may be “massively overvalued”
because it has misrepresented its revenue and profit, short
seller Absaroka Capital Management LLC said in a report to
clients.  Stream Global Services Inc. (SGS)   surged 22 percent, the
most in the Russell 2000, to $3.72. The provider of technical
support and business outsourcing services received a nonbinding
offer from Trillium Capital LLC for $4.65 a share in cash.
Trillium said it would also assume $200 million high-yield bonds
due in 2014.  Telvent GIT SA (TLVT)   climbed 15 percent to $39.73, the
biggest gain since December 2008. The Spanish information
technology provider agreed to be bought by Schneider Electric SA
(SU FP) for about 1.4 billion euros ($2 billion), or $40 a
share.  T. Rowe Price Group Inc. (TROW US) fell 6 percent, the most
since June 2009, to $59.52. The mutual  fund manager  was cut to
“neutral” from “buy” at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
