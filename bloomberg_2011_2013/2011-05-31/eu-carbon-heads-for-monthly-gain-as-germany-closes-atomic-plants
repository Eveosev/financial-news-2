European Union carbon permits headed
for a gain this month as utilities boost demand for hedging
forward sales of power.  EU allowances for December rose 1.6 percent today to 17.16
euros ($24.72) a metric ton on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange
in London as of 2:38 p.m. That would be the highest close since
May 3 and compares with 17.14 euros on April 29. December 2013
permits jumped 2 percent today to 19.13 euros.  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s coalition won’t allow eight
reactors halted for safety checks and repairs to restart,
leaving Europe’s biggest economy to rely on alternative sources
and imports. Seven reactors were shut in the second half of
March after the nuclear disaster in  Japan  caused concern about
safety. The eighth unit, Vattenfall AB’s Kruemmel, has been shut
since 2009.  Carbon permits may advance as high as 17.80 euros a ton
this week, Bloomberg New Energy Finance analysts including
Konrad Hanschmidt said today by e-mail.  “As the proposal is expected to become a political
certainty by July 8, power companies will need to cover their
nuclear power forward sales” by buying back electricity or
purchasing EU permits and fuels to produce it using gas or coal,
Hanschmidt said.  “The reported lack of utility hedging recently, despite
the healthy dark spreads, could indicate that they are yet to
cover much of their nuclear-generation shortage,” he said.
“Once they enter the market to adjust their over-sold nuclear
position, we could see further EU-allowance-price jumps.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
