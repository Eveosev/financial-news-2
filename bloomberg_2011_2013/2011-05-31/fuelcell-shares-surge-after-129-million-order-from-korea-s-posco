FuelCell Energy Inc. (FCEL) , a maker of low-
pollution power plants, surged as much as 13 percent in early
New York trading after winning a record $129 million order from
a unit of Korean steelmaker  Posco. (005490)   FuelCell climbed 14 cents, or 9.6 percent, to $1.60 at 8:36
a.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Earlier, the stock reached
as high as $1.65. The Danbury, Connecticut-based company
initially sold shares in June 1992, at $9 each.  The company will sell Posco 70 megawatts of fuel cells over
two years starting in October, it said today in a statement. The
order will help FuelCell maintain annual production capacity of
55 megawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
