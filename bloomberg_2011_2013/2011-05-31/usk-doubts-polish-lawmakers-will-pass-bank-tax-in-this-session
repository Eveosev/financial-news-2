Poland  probably won’t pass a special
tax on the country’s banks before the end of the current
parliament’s term, Prime Minister  Donald Tusk  said.  Since there are still 200 bills pending and only seven or
eight sessions are left until the end of term, I “doubt the
parliamentary agenda can fit in new legislations projects,”
Tusk said at a press conference in Warsaw today.  Poland expects annual revenue of between 500 million zloty
($181 million) and 700 million zloty from the tax on the banks
it plans to impose next year, the PAP newswire said, citing the
Polish government’s draft bill.  To contact the reporters on this story:
