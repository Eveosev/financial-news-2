Tanzania’s banks almost tripled the
amount of assets they hold over the past five years as loans
swelled, Serengeti Advisors Ltd. said.  Assets expanded to 15.3 trillion shillings ($9.9 billion)
by December 2010 from 5.5 trillion shillings in 2006, the Dar es
Salaam-based consultancy said in its Tanzania Banking Survey
2011 report released today.  The industry’s loan-book more than tripled to 5.9 trillion
shillings in the period, while the number of lenders in East
Africa’s second-biggest economy increased to 41 from 33,
according to the report.  Tanzania’s three biggest banks by assets are  FBME Bank
Ltd. ,  CRDB Bank Plc (CRDB)  and National Microfinance Bank Plc, the
report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
