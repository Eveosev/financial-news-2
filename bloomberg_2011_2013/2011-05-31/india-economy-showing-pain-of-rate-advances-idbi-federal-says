Aneesh Srivastava, who oversees $465
million as chief investment officer at IDBI Federal Life
Insurance Co. in Mumbai, comments on  India’s economy  and the
outlook for the nation’s stocks.  The country’s economy expanded 7.8 percent in the three
months ended March from a year earlier, the government said in a
report today. The median of estimates in a Bloomberg News survey
was for an 8.1 percent increase.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index pared a gain of
as much as 1 percent. The gauge rose 0.5 percent to 18,327.55 at
11:23 a.m. local time.  Srivastava spoke by telephone.  “The GDP number shows that interest rate increases have
started to impact economic growth. The pain has started coming
in. This will also translate into a moderation in corporate
earnings.”  On the markets:  “The market’s not going to go anywhere in a hurry. It is
building in an economic growth of somewhere around 8 percent to
8.2 percent going forward.”  On his investment strategy:  “One has to be defensive. We would prefer sticking to
makers of  consumer goods  and pharmaceuticals. It is better to
have lower exposure to engineering and infrastructure stocks.”  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
