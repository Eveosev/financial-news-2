Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ)  said
it is scrapping plans for a mid-June partial restart at its
Horizon oil sands upgrader after forest fires forced workers
from the site.  All four coke drums at Horizon will now be started together
in August, the Calgary-based company said in a statement. The
plant should reach full production within two to three weeks of
start up.  Horizon was shut by an explosion and fire Jan. 6. Repairs,
which had been delayed by cold weather, were further hampered
May 16 when forest fires burning in the region forced the
evacuation of workers. Canadian Natural said the fires put
repairs about three weeks behind schedule and work will resume
at the site June 4.  Canadian Natural said its full-year production guidance
won’t change because of the delay. Its estimated repair cost of
C$350 million ($362 million) to C$450 million hasn’t changed.  Horizon can produce 110,000 barrels of synthetic crude
daily. The company had planned to produce 55,000 barrels a day
by the start of the third quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
