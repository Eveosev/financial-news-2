The ranks of millionaires expanded by
12 percent in 2010, led by Singapore, as gains in financial
markets lifted global wealth for a second straight year, the
 Boston Consulting Group  said.  The number of millionaire households increased to about
12.5 million, the Boston-based firm said in a study released
today. Singapore millionaires rose by almost 33 percent after
jumping about 40 percent a year earlier. The U.S. had the most
$1 million-plus households, with 5.2 million, followed by  Japan 
and  China .  “We have seen a growth from 2008 to 2010 that matches the
growth from 2005 to 2007,” Peter Damisch, a partner based in
the firm’s Zurich office and head of the wealth-management
practice in  Europe , said in a telephone interview. “But the
growth from 2008 to 2010 was driven by the recovery of equity
markets and much less by the generation of new wealth.”  Global assets under management rose by 8 percent to $121.8
trillion in 2010, beating the study’s previous peak of $111.8
trillion in 2007. The U.S. and  Canada  had the greatest absolute
gain, climbing $3.6 trillion to $38.2 trillion and replacing
Europe as the richest region. Assets in Asia-Pacific, excluding
Japan, rose 17 percent, the fastest among regions.  The study looked at 62 countries representing more than 98
percent of global gross domestic product. Some numbers may
differ from those in last year’s report because of currency
fluctuations and the availability of newer data, said Damisch, a
co-author of the report.  More Equities Owned  The increase in wealth last year was mostly a result of
strong performance by financial markets, the report said. The
MSCI AC World Index, which tracks stocks in developed and
emerging markets, returned 13 percent last year, including
dividends.  North America  continued to have the highest
proportion of wealth held in stocks, at 44 percent.  Less than 1 percent of households globally were considered
millionaires, which is defined as investable assets of more than
$1 million, excluding real estate and property such as art.
Wealth became more concentrated, with millionaire households
controlling 39 percent of the world’s assets, up from 37 percent
a year earlier, the study said.  Singapore also had the highest proportion of millionaire
households at 15.5 percent, followed by  Switzerland  and Qatar.
 Saudi Arabia  had the highest concentration of ultra-high-net-
worth households, which are those with more than $100 million in
assets, at 18 per 100,000. Switzerland was second, and  Hong Kong 
was third.  Offshore Wealth  The amount of offshore wealth, defined as assets housed in
a country other than the investor’s legal residence or tax
domicile, increased by $300 billion to $7.8 trillion because of
market performance and asset inflows, primarily from emerging
markets. The proportion of wealth held offshore declined to 6.4
percent from 6.6 percent in part because of stricter regulations
in Europe and North America.  Global wealth will increase at a compound annual rate of
almost 6 percent from year-end 2010 through 2015 to about $162
trillion, the study said. Wealth in the Asia-Pacific region,
excluding Japan, is expected to rise at almost double the global
rate, which will result in the region’s share of global wealth
increasing to 23 percent in 2015.  New Assets  The report’s authors also looked at the performance of 120
wealth management firms worldwide. Revenue increased by an
average of 8.5 percent, and assets under management increased by
7.5 percent, down from 12.8 percent a year earlier.  Net new assets, which is the difference between asset
inflows and outflows, increased to 2.3 percent of overall assets
managed at the end of the previous year in 2010 from 1.3 percent
in 2009, yet remained below pre-crisis levels, the study said.
The 2009 number was reduced from 1.5 percent after the firm
received more samples. There will continue to be “stronger
flows” back to wealth management firms, according to Monish
Kumar, a senior partner in the firm’s New York office.  “Wealth management has been a fabulous business and going
forward it’s still going to be a very good business, but a
little less attractive because of more demanding clients,
pricing pressure and increased regulatory costs,” Damisch said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
