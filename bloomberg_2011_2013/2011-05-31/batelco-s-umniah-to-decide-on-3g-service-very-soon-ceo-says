Umniah , a unit of Bahrain
Telecommunications Co., will decide “very soon” on when to
introduce a faster 3G wireless service, Chief Executive Officer
Ihab Hinnawi said.  If Umniah starts its 3G service this year as planned then
investment will double to $100 million, Hinnawi told reporters
in Amman today.  The kingdom has three mobile operators. Zain  Jordan , a unit
of Kuwait-based Mobile Telecommunications Co., is the largest
with 3.3 million subscribers and 39 percent of the market, Chief
Executive Officer Abdul Malik al-Jaber said today. Last year,
 Jordan Telecom (JTEL)  Corp. was the second largest, the country’s
Telecommunications Regulatory Commission said May 19.  “We have more than 2.2 million subscribers, up by 40
percent from the previous year and that is the highest growth in
the market,” Hinnawi said. “We are the second-largest operator
in Jordan, with a market share of 31.5 percent.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
