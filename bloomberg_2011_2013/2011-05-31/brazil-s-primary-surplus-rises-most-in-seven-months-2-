Brazil ’s budget surplus before
interest payments rose the most in seven months in April, and
pushed the year-to-date total up to nearly half of the
government’s target for 2011.  The primary surplus, which includes federal and local
governments as well as state companies, increased to 18.1
billion reais ($11.4 billion) in April, from 13.6 billion reais
in March, the central bank said today. The surplus was lower
than the 19.4 billion reais median forecast in a Bloomberg
survey of 14 analysts.  Policy makers’ 2012 inflation outlook assumes President
 Dilma Rousseff ’s government will hit its 2011 target of a 117.9
billion reais primary surplus, the central bank said in its
quarterly inflation report published in March. Central bank
President Alexandre Tombini on May 19 said Brazil has “work
ahead” to bring inflation back to the mid-point of its 2.5
percent to 6.5 percent target range next year.  “It’s a good omen for the accomplishment of the target,
but it is going to take some time for market participants to
really believe that the central government and the public sector
are going to deliver,” said  Jankiel Santos , chief economist at
Espirito Santo Investment Bank.  The accumulated surplus in the first four months of the
year was 57.3 billion reais, equivalent to 48.6 percent of the
annual target. Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  on May 27 forecast
a consolidated primary budget surplus of 60 billion reais for
the January-April period, half the 2011 goal.  In the first four months of 2010, the accumulated surplus
was equal to 35 percent of the target, Tulio Maciel, head of the
central bank’s economic department, told reporters in Brasilia.  Policy Balance  The April primary surplus was less than economists expected
due to higher spending from regional governments, which posted a
surplus of 2.6 billion reais before interest payments, down from
4.4 billion reais in March.  Having already reached nearly half their budget target for
the year, the government may adopt a looser control of spending,
said Enestor  Dos Santos , senior Brazil economist for BBVA in
 Madrid .  “They will do whatever they have to do to meet the target
but not more than that,” Dos Santos said in reply to an e-
mailed question.  The yield on the interest rate future contract maturing in
January 2012, the most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 12.34 percent at 2:06 p.m.
New York time. The real strengthened 1 percent to 1.5782 to the
 U.S. dollar .  Rate Outlook  Net debt fell to 39.8 percent of gross domestic product in
April, from 39.9 percent in March. Brazil’s net debt will fall
to 39.3 percent of gross domestic product in May, and to 38
percent by the end of the year, Maciel said.  The  budget deficit  narrowed to 1.6 billion reais, from 6.9
billion reais in March, the central bank said.  Rousseff’s administration pledged to cut 50.7 billion reais
from this year’s budget to help the central bank contain
inflation.  Annual inflation was 6.51 percent through mid-May, above
the upper limit of the target range for the first time since
2005. Economists expect prices to rise 6.23 percent this year,
and 5.1 percent in 2012, according to the central bank’s weekly
survey of economists published May 30.  Traders are wagering that the central bank will raise
borrowing costs by 25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, to
12 percent at its June 7-8 policy meeting, interest-rate futures
contracts show.  Industrial production fell 2.1 percent from March,
surprising analysts who had expected output to rise in  Latin
America ’s largest economy.  The result was worse than all 35 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey had expected, whose median estimate had been for a 0.2
percent increase. Output fell 1.3 percent from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
