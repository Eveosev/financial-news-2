Canadian stocks fell the most in nine
months, led by financial and energy companies, after private
reports showed growth in U.S. employment and manufacturing
slowed last month.  Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the country’s fifth-
largest lender by assets, dropped 3.5 percent after an analyst
at  Royal Bank of Canada (RY)  cut his rating on the shares.  Canadian
Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) , the country’s second-largest energy
company by market value, lost 4 percent as oil futures
retreated. BlackBerry maker  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  declined 5.1
percent after UBS AG named it a “least-preferred” stock.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index decreased 275
points, or 2 percent, to 13,527.88 after the Institute for
Supply Management’s index of U.S. manufacturing dropped to its
lowest level since September 2009. The May figure trailed 82 of
83 economists’ forecasts in a Bloomberg survey.  “This is a further confirmation of a slowing down of the
economy,” said Sebastian van Berkom, a  money manager  at Van Berkom & Associates in  Montreal , which oversees C$1.6 billion
($1.6 billion). “The statistics are coming down below
estimates, therefore the market reacts negatively.”  The index yesterday completed its third-straight monthly
loss, the longest streak since February 2009. Indexes of S&P/TSX
energy and materials stocks slumped 4.5 percent and 5.9 percent,
respectively, in May as crude futures sank 9.9 percent and
silver plunged 21 percent while the  U.S. dollar  climbed for the
first time since November. Energy and raw-materials companies
make up 49 percent of Canadian stocks by market value, according
to Bloomberg data.  Slow Hiring  ADP Employer Services said today that U.S. employers added
38,000 jobs last month, missing the median estimate 175,000 in a
Bloomberg survey of economists.  Also today, Moody’s Investors Service cut its  credit rating 
on Greek bonds to Caa1 from B1, and JPMorgan Chase & Co. reduced
its forecast for U.S. second-quarter economic growth to an
annualized rate of 2 percent from 2.5 percent.  An index of S&P/TSX financial stocks declined the most
since August.  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) ,  Canada ’s second-largest
lender by assets, fell 3.2 percent, the most in a year, to
C$80.81. Royal Bank, its bigger rival, decreased 2.9 percent to
C$54.98.  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) ,  North America ’s fourth-
largest insurer, slid 4.8 percent to C$16.44.  CIBC retreated 3.5 percent to C$77.54 after Andre-Philippe Hardy, an analyst at Royal Bank, cut his rating to “sector
perform” from “outperform.” The lender has the most to lose
among Canadian banks from a slowdown in domestic  consumer
lending , Hardy wrote in a note to clients.  The S&P/TSX Energy Index fell for the first time in six
days as crude oil dropped the most in three weeks and natural
gas futures declined.  Encana, Cenovus  Encana Corp. (ECA) , Canada’s largest nautral gas producer, lost
2.6 percent to C$32.15.  Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE) , the country’s
fifth-biggest energy company, declined for the first time in
eight days, decreasing 4.4 percent to C$34.21. Canadian Natural
retreated 4 percent to C$40.48.  Corridor Resources Inc. (CDH) , which explores for oil and gas in
eastern Canada, plunged 25 percent to an 18-month low of C$3.18
after saying Apache Corp. has pulled out of a shale-gas joint
venture in  New Brunswick .  Oilfield services company  Trinidad Drilling Ltd. (TDG)  fell 6
percent, the most in nine months, to C$10.29 after reporting
profit and sales that missed analyst estimates.  Base-metal and coal producers dropped as copper declined.

Anglo American Plc’s partner in the Pebble project in  Alaska ,
decreased 5.9 percent to C$11.55.  Profit Miss  Reitmans (Canada) Ltd., which owns the country’s biggest
chain of women’s clothing stores, tumbled 7.2 percent, the most
in 25 months, to C$16.47 after reporting first-quarter profit of
1 Canadian cent a share, excluding certain items. Two analysts
had estimated earnings of 23 Canadian cents a share and 24
Canadian cents a share, respectively.  RIM, Canada’s largest technology company, slumped 5.1
percent to C$39.23 after closing at a four-year low yesterday.
In a note to clients, Amitabh Passi, an analyst at UBS, said
increasing competition in the smartphone market may reduce
profit margins.  Intact Financial Corp. (IFC) , Canada’s biggest property and
casualty insurer, soared 9.7 percent to more than a four-year
high of C$54.62 after agreeing to buy Axa SA’s Canadian unit for
C$2.6 billion. The purchase will increase Intact’s premiums by
C$2 billion to more than C$6.5 billion, the company said in a
statement.  Sino-Forest Corp., a forestry company with operations in
 China , dropped 5.5 percent to C$18.21 after a purchasing
