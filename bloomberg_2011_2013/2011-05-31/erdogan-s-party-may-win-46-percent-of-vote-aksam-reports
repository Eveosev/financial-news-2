Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s
governing party may win 46 percent of the vote in an election
next week, Aksam said citing an opinion poll by research company
IKSara.  The main opposition  Republican People’s Party  has 28
percent support and the Nationalist Action Party 11 percent, the
Istanbul-based newspaper reported.  One in six people are still not certain which party they
will vote for, the poll showed, according to Aksam.  Seventy percent of those questioned said the Nationalist
Action Party wouldn’t be affected by a recent wave of
resignations, Aksam said. Twenty-three percent of voters said
the party’s vote would be affected positively, it said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
