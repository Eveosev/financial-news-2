Israel Discount Bank Ltd. (DSCT) , the
countryâ€™s third-largest lender by assets, jumped the most in
almost two years after first-quarter profit almost doubled as
provisions for doubtful debt declined.  The shares advanced 5 percent, the most since September
2009, to 6.859 shekels at the 4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv .  Net income rose to 278 million shekels ($81 million) from
143 million shekels a year earlier, the Tel Aviv-based bank said
today, topping the 211 million-shekel median estimate of three
analysts on Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
