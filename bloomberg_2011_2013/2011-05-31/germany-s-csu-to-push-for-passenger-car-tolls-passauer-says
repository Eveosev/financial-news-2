Horst Seehofer, the head of the
 Christian Social Union , allies of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, said the country needs
highway tolls for passenger cars to help finance road and rail
projects, Passauer Neue Presse reported, citing an interview.  Seehofer said he will fight for the tolls, with the main
aim being to require people from outside  Germany  to pay for
using the country’s highways, according to an e-mailed preview
