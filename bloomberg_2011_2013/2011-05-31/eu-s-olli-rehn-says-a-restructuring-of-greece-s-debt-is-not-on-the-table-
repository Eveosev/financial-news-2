European Union Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said today Greek “debt
restructuring is not on the table.”   Rehn, speaking in a Bloomberg Television interview, said
that “EU negotiations haven’t been easy. They’ve been quite
difficult.” He said that “all EU member states are on board”
with discussing a Vienna-style initiative for  Greece .  As head of the group of euro-area finance ministers,
Luxembourg Prime Minsiter Jean-Claude Juncker “certainly knows
what he is talking about,” Rehn said during the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
