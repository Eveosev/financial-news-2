Grain plantings in Poland, the
European Union’s third-largest producer behind  France  and
 Germany , fell by 0.4 percent this year to about 8.1 million
hectares (20 million acres), the Warsaw-based  Central
Statistical Office  said today.  In its spring estimate of crop conditions, the office said
rapeseed plantings had decreased 12.5 percent from a year
earlier to about 700,000 hectares, according to a survey carried
out in the first 10 days of May. Sugar beet plantings were 2.2
percent lower at 195,500 hectares.  The winter wheat crop was graded 3.5 on the office’s five-
point scale, in which 3 is an “adequate” rating and 4 is
“good.” That compares with a 3.6 grade last year. The
statistics office rated year’s rapeseed crop at 2.9, down from
3.6 a year ago.  Winter kill totaled 1.4 percent of all grain plantings, 1
percent of winter wheat and 16 percent of rapeseed, the
statistics office said.  Poland ’s grain production in the 2010-2011 season ending
next month will be 27 million tons, compared with 65 million
tons for France and 44 million tons for Germany, according to
the International Grains Council.  To contact the reporter on this story:
