(Corrects first and second paragraphs to specify that EADS
isn’t commenting on source of allegations.)  European Aeronautic, Defence & Space
Co. said it is probing allegations related to contracts in the
U.K. against a unit of Paradigm Services, the division that
supplies satellite services in the country.  “Certain allegations have been made and these are being
properly investigated,” an EADS spokesman, Alvaro Meredith,
said by telephone. He said he was unable to comment on the
nature of the allegations nor on the body that had made the
allegations.  EADS is being investigated in connection with the award of
a $3.3 billion contract for communications and intranet services
for the Saudi National Guard,  Reuters reported  today, citing a
person close to the investigation. The allegations were first
reported in the Sunday Times.  David Jones , a spokesman for the U.K.’s Serious Fraud
Office, which prosecutes corruption, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
