The amount of cocaine trafficked
through West Africa has been declining steadily over the past
four years, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and
Crime.  Narcotics that transit from  South Africa  to  Europe  via West
Africa have seen a “plateau to slight drop,” said Preeta
Bannerjee, an information officer with Vienna-based UNODC.  Since peaking at as much as 47 metric tons in 2007, the
amount of trafficking drugs along that route may have fallen to
as low as 21 tons in 2009, the latest year for which data is
available, she said in an e-mailed statement. The volume of
cocaine consumed in Europe, however, has doubled in the last
decade, Bannerjee said.  The UN’s anti-crime agency will release new estimates of the
amounts of trafficked drugs on June 23, she said.  During a May 17 interview, Manuel de Almeida Pereira, a
legal adviser with the UNODC in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau’s capital,
said that traffic of Europe-bound cocaine from West Africa had
doubled since 2006.  “We don’t have data to substantiate this claim,” Bannerjee
said by phone May 30. “If we go by seizures -- that’s the solid
evidence we have -- the seizures don’t suggest that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
