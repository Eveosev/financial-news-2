Canadian natural gas rose as hot
weather in Toronto and the U.S. Northeast boosted demand for
gas-fired generators to run air conditioners.  Temperatures in  Canada ’s most-populous city may reach 32
degrees Celsius (90 Fahrenheit) today, 8 degrees higher than
normal, according to  Environment Canada .  New York  temperatures
hit 87 Fahrenheit, 12 degrees above the norm, according to State
College, Pennsylvania-based forecaster AccuWeather Inc.  “The forecast is for a lot of heat,” said Kyle Cooper,
director of research with IAF Advisors in Houston. “That seems
to be the driver of the market.”  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near  Chicago 
surged 36.66 cents, or 8.4 percent, to $4.7446 per million
British thermal units on the  Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance
is an express line that can carry about 1.5 billion cubic feet a
day to the Midwest from western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas jumped 26.63 cents, or 6.5 percent, to $4.3884,
according to ICE. At Malin, Oregon, where Canadian gas is traded
for California markets, gas was up 24.02 cents to $4.481.  Alberta gas for July delivery rose 14 cents, or 3.6
percent, to C$3.975 per gigajoule ($3.89 per million British
thermal units) as of 3:30 p.m. New York time, according to  NGX, 
a Canadian Internet market. Gas traded on the exchange is
shipped to users in Canada and the U.S., and is priced on
TransCanada’s Alberta system.  On the Nymex  Natural gas for July delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  gained 14.8 cents, or 3.3 percent, to settle at $4.666
per million Btu.  Volume on  TransCanada Corp.’s   Alberta  system, which
collects the output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.7
billion cubic feet as of 2.30 p.m. in New York, 277 million
below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.59 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.6 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 879 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.42 billion cubic feet today, about 62 percent of its
capacity of 2.3 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.06
billion cubic feet at 2:20 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
