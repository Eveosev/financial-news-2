S.A.G. Solarstrom AG rose as much as
4 percent in Frankfurt electronic trading after its shareholders
approved increasing the dividend 25 percent and re-authorized
the company to buy and own as much a tenth of its shares. The
German solar park developer said today in a filing that it
currently holds 3.7 percent of its stock, and that shareholders
also approved it selling new shares to increase capital by as
much as 15 million euros.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
