Kenya’s budget may be delayed after a
civil-rights group petitioned the Constitutional Court to halt
the process because provisions of the country’s constitution
weren’t followed, Business Daily reportd.  The International Centre for Policy and Conflict charged
that Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  didn’t submit revenue
estimates and spending proposals to parliament before his
speech, which is scheduled for June 8, the Nairobi-based
newspaper said.  Under the constitution, Kenyatta should have submitted the
proposals at least two months before the fiscal year ends on
June 30, the newspaper cited the group as saying.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
