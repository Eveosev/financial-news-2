Gas Natural SDG SA (GAS)  aims to rise among
Spanish renewable-energy producers to the third ranking from its
fifth position over “the medium term,” El Economista reported,
citing unidentified company officials.  The utility plans to invest 1.2 billion euros ($1.7
billion) by 2014 and carry out planned investments in projects
it won in contests in several regions of  Spain , including wind
farms in its home region of Catalonia, the report said.  The Barcelona-based natural gas supplier, which lags behind
 Iberdrola SA (IBE) ,  Acciona SA (ANA) , EDP-Energias de Portugal SA and Enel
Green Power in producing low-polluting electricity in Spain,
aims to multiply its installed base 2.6 times to 2.5 gigawatts
so that it can produce 6,000 gigawatt-hours annually.  The goals were reaffirmed after Gas Natural yesterday
completed its accord with  Enel Green Power SpA (EGPW)  to break up their
joint venture, giving the Spanish company about 500 megawatts of
wind, minihydroelectric and co-generation assets, plus a
pipeline of wind, solar-thermal and biomass projects.  Gas Natural is potentially a bidder for clean-energy assets
that Actividades de Construccion y Servicios SA has put up for
sale, the report said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
