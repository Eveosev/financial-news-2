SEB AB has won 20 new corporate
customers in  Germany  this year,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 
reported, citing Fredrik Boheman, head of SEB’s German unit.  The Swedish bank, which sold its German retail business to
Spain’s  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  last year, grows its German corporate
business volumes of 20 billion euros ($29 billion) by about 10
percent a year, the newspaper reported today. Germany is “by
far the most important growth market” for SEB as a group,
Boheman told the Frankfurt-based newspaper. SEB has 400
corporate clients in Germany, he said, according to FAZ.  To contact the reporter on this story:
