China ’s stocks rose, ending the
longest losing streak for the benchmark index since December
2008, as investors speculated losses were excessive.  Huaneng Power International Inc. (600011) , the listed unit of
China’s largest power group, advanced the most in three weeks
after a government official said electricity prices will be
raised. China Shenhua Energy Co. led energy companies higher as
coal and oil prices increased. Poly Real Estate Group Co. slid
to a six-month low after the Shanghai Daily said the central
bank may boost interest rates as soon as this weekend.  The Shanghai Composite Index rose 21.43, or 0.8 percent, to
2,727.79 at 2:04 p.m., snapping an eight-day, 5.8 percent
retreat. The CSI 300 Index added 0.8 percent to 2,978.38.  “The power price increase may help lift  market
sentiment ,” said Wu Kan, a  fund manager  at Dazhong Insurance
Co., which oversees $285 million. “The move should go some way
to easing power shortages and removing some pressure on
production capacity.”  The government will raise retail electricity prices
starting next month, the first increase in more than a year, to
curb demand and boost power generation as the nation battles a
shortage that may be the worst in history.  The Shanghai Composite has lost 6.3 percent this month, the
biggest loss since June 2010, on concern growth in the world’s
second-largest economy is slowing after the central bank raised
the reserve-requirement ratio for banks 11 times and boosted
 interest rates  four times to cool inflation. The gauge has
plunged 11 percent from this year’s high on April 18, a sign to
some investors that the market has entered a correction.  Relative Strength  Stocks on the Shanghai Composite trade at about 15.3 times
reported earnings, compared with a peak of about 53 times in
2007. The gauge’s relative strength index dropped to 24
yesterday, below the 30 point level that indicates an asset may
rebound in value.  Huaneng Power gained 1.6 percent to 5.62 yuan, set for the
biggest rise since May 9. China Yangtze Power Co. advanced 1.2
percent to 7.40 yuan.  Power prices for industrial users in 15 provinces will
increase starting tomorrow and those paid by residential users
will remain unchanged, said an official with the National
Development and Reform Commission, the top economic planner, who
declined to be identified because of internal rules.  China is battling an electricity supply shortfall that may
reach as much as 40 gigawatts this summer, surpassing the
shortage in 2004, the country’s worst, according to State Grid
Corp. of China. The price increase, the first since November
2009, may spur  power plants  to increase utilization rates after
rising coal costs and government caps on electricity tariffs.  Earnings Boost  The tariff increase “only partially removes the price
distortion,” Citigroup Inc. analysts led by Minggao Shen said
in a report dated yesterday. After the rise, the power
tariff/coal price ratio is still  “far below” the average
level in 2009-2010, they wrote. Still, the increase may indicate
the bottom for earnings of independent power producers and boost
coal companies, the analysts said.  Shenhua Energy advanced 0.8 percent to 28.06 yuan. Yanzhou
Coal Mining Co. added 1.2 percent to 31.94 yuan. PetroChina Co
rose 0.2 percent to 11 yuan.  Benchmark power-station coal prices at Qinhuangdao port
increased 0.6 percent yesterday from a week earlier to the
highest level since October 2008, according to data from the
China Coal Transport and Distribution Association. Crude for
July delivery gained as much as 86 cents to $101.45 in  New York 
and was at $101.17 recently.  Inflation Concern  The central bank may raise interest rates ahead of a public
holiday on June 6 because consumer prices are expected to rise
to a new high in May, Shanghai Daily said today, citing UBS AG.
Inflation rose 5.3 percent last month, exceeding the
government’s full-year target of 4 percent.  A gauge tracking property stocks on the Shanghai Composite
was the worst performer among the five industry groups. Poly
Real Estate fell 2.5 percent to 9.27 yuan, set for its
lowest close since Dec. 10. China Vanke Co., the nation’s
largest developer by market value, dropped 0.8 percent to 7.74
yuan.  Home sales in China may decline by more than 10 percent
this year because of government tightening measures, the
Shanghai Daily said, citing Nie Meisheng, head of the China Real
Estate Chamber of Commerce.  The government has intensified its crack-down on
speculation in the  property market  by introducing purchase
limits in some cities.  --Irene Shen. Editor: Richard Frost  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
