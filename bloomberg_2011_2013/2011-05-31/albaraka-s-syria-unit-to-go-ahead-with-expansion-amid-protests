Albaraka Banking Group (BARKA) ’s unit in
Syria plans to open five branches this year even as a popular
uprising in the Arab nation enters its 12th week.  Al Baraka Bank Syria  will open a branch in the northern
city of Aleppo this week, the unit’s Chief Executive Officer
Mohammad Halabi said in an interview May 30. "We are continuing
with our plans because we have confidence in the Syrian economy
and because we believe that the current unrest is only a
temporary situation," he said.  The Syrian government is seeking to end unrest in some
parts of the country after protest broke out in the southern
city of Daraa in mid March as people demand greater freedom.  The Shariah-compliant bank, which started operations in
2010, has four branches in  Syria , according to the company’s
website. Al Baraka plans to capture as much as 30 percent of the
Islamic finance market by 2013, Halabi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
