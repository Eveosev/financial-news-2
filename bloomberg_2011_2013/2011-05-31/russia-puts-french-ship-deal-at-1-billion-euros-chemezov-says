Russia  expects to soon sign a
contract to buy four Mistral helicopter carriers from France,
Russian Technologies Corp. Chief Executive Officer  Sergei Chemezov  told reporters today in Moscow.  “We would like to sign it soon,” Chemezov said, declining
to say whether it would take place next month. The price for
four warships is about 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion), he said.  President  Dmitry Medvedev  said last week in Deauville,
France, that the two countries reached a final agreement on
Mistrals, two of which will be built in Russia.  France’s state-owned military contractor DCNS and the
shipbuilder STX will build the first two ships in France, with
two others to be built in Russia. The Mistral is a 200-meter
(656-foot) ship, capable of carrying as many as 700 combat
troops, 16 helicopters and 60 armored vehicles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
