Inflation risks are increasing and
the European Central Bank’s monetary policy remains
accommodative, said ECB governing council member  Mario Draghi .  “The risk of inflation is rising,” Draghi said in a
speech at the Bank of Italy’s annual meeting in Rome. “There is
now a greater need to proceed with monetary policy normalization
so as to prevent expectations of higher inflation from becoming
entrenched.”  Draghi will be guiding European monetary policy when he
takes over as ECB president when Jean-Claude Trichet’s term ends
later this year. Draghi used his speech today to drive home the
point that the region’s sovereign debt crisis and
undercapitalized banks will not distract the ECB from its
primary goal of protecting  price stability .   “Neither the existence of sovereign risks nor some banks’
abnormal dependence on ECB financing can divert it from this
objective,” he said.   Greece, Ireland and  Portugal , which have received 256
billion euros ($369 billion) in bailouts, have the potential to
cause “significant systemic risk.” he said. European governments
must continue to control their public finances, even at a time
when most advanced economies are still struggling to recovery
from the global financial crisis  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
