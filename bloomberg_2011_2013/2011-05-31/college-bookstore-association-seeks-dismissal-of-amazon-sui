A trade group for college bookstores
that has challenged  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) ’s advertising claims for
discounted textbooks asked a federal judge to dismiss the online
retailer’s lawsuit against it.  The National Association of College Stores Inc. was sued by
Amazon.com May 3 in a complaint seeking a court order declaring
that its advertised 30 percent discounts on new textbooks and 90
percent discounts on used books aren’t false or misleading.  In March the Oberlin, Ohio-based group asked the Better
Business Bureau’s national advertising division to review the
ads, which it says are deceptive and haven’t been substantiated.
Amazon.com hasn’t been harmed by the association or its request
for a review, so the complaint should be thrown out, the group
said in a May 27 court filing in federal court in  Seattle .  The lawsuit appears to have been filed to thwart the
college store group’s effort to have the Amazon.com ads reviewed
by the bureau, the filing says. The complaint was closed because
the bureau doesn’t accept cases that are the subject of
lawsuits, the filing says.  A voice-mail message left at Seattle-based Amazon.com’s
media office wasn’t immediately returned.  The case is Amazon.com v. National Association of College
Stores Inc., 11-754, U.S. District Court, Western District of
 Washington  (Seattle).  To contact the reporter on this story:
