Stocks with the most reliable
earnings are underperforming those with the least predictable
results by the most since at least 1997 and may soon start to
outperform, Morgan Stanley Investment Management said.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares the performance of so-called
high-quality companies on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index with
low-quality businesses. S&P awards all equities a quality rating
based on the sustainability and robustness of both their
earnings and their balance sheets.  “Despite all the uncertainty in the market, quality is
very cheap at the moment,” said Bruno Paulson, the portfolio
manager of MSIM’s global franchise strategy, which has $6.3
billion under management, in  London . “It’s not unreasonable to
expect some re-rating from here. I don’t know what will trigger
it; it might be the end of liquidity.”  So far this year, MSIM’s global franchise strategy, which
only invests in so-called quality companies such as British
American Tobacco Plc, Kellogg Co. and Nestle SA, has attracted
almost $1 billion of positive gross inflows from clients,
according to Paulson.  “You’ve got this tension between profits being good and
growing and an awful lot that can go wrong in the world,” he
said. “We think now is an attractive entry point given how
cheap quality is today. I can tell you what Nestle will be
earning going forward, but whether the market goes up or down I
simply don’t know.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
