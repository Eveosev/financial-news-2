The  California Public Employees’
Retirement System , the largest U.S. public pension, named Real Desrochers, a former Saudi Arabian Investment Co. executive, to
run the fund’s $49 billion in private-equity assets.  Desrochers replaces Leon Shahinian, who stepped down in
August after being named in a state lawsuit against  Alfred Villalobos , a former Calpers board member turned middleman. The
state claimed Villalobos improperly influenced fund investment
decisions by lavishly entertaining its managers. Shahinian
wasn’t accused of any wrongdoing in the case.  The $235.7 billion fund earned a return of 18.6 percent on
assets in the first nine months of its fiscal year. The fund’s
performance was led by gains in stocks and private equity, which
produced a 17.6 percent increase, though reporting of the latter
results may lag as much as four months behind other categories.  Desrochers also ran the alternative-investment program
including private-equity assets for the California State
Teachers’ Retirement System for a decade until he left in 2009.
At Saudi Arabian, he was chief investment officer, according to
a Calpers statement.  Joe Dear , Calpers’s chief investment officer, managed the
private-equity assets during the search to replace Shahinian.  To contact the reporter on this story:
