Cocoa rose in New York and  London  as
concerns about supplies from top producer  Ivory Coast  remain
even as output soars in Ghana, the world’s second-largest
grower. Sugar climbed.  Cocoa prices will trade “in the region” of $3,000 a
metric ton in New York this year as security concerns may
prevent some farmers from tending to their crops in Ivory Coast,
the  International Cocoa Organization  said. Ghana reaped a record
903,646 tons of the chocolate ingredient in its main growing
season, an increase of 54 percent, figures from the  Ghana Cocoa
Board  showed.  “Maybe it will take some time before shipments from Ivory
Coast resume and supply enters the market,” Commerzbank AG
analyst  Carsten Fritsch  wrote in an e-mail today. “The reports
from Ghana and Ivory Coast suggest that the market will be
flooded with  cocoa beans .”  Cocoa for July delivery climbed $28, or 0.9 percent, to
$2,997 a ton by 9:21 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. Cocoa
for July delivery advanced 15 pounds, or 0.8 percent, to 1,828
pounds ($3,015) a ton on NYSE Liffe in London.  Ivorian supplies were disrupted earlier this year as an
armed conflict erupted between the supporters of President
 Alassane Ouattara  and those of former leader  Laurent Gbagbo , who
refused to cede power after losing a Nov. 28 election. Gbagbo
was captured last month and Ouattara was sworn in as the
country’s president on May 21.  Ivory Coast  “In the west of the country, because of the particularly
ferocious battles that took place there, quite a few farmers
have left their villages so we believe that there is a
likelihood that some cocoa farms will not be tended at all,”
ICCO Executive Director Jean-Marc Anga said in an interview at
the organization’s offices in London last week.  Crop disruptions may buoy prices even after companies such
as Archer Daniels Midland Co., Cargill Inc. and  Barry Callebaut
AG (BARN)  resumed exports earlier this month. Cocoa futures reached a
32-year high of $3,775 a ton on March 4, during the fighting.  Raw sugar for July delivery rose 0.18 cent, or 0.8 percent,
to 23.17 cents a pound on ICE. White, or refined, sugar for
August delivery climbed $15.90, or 2.4 percent, to $674.20 a ton
on NYSE Liffe.  Indonesia  issued permits to import 224,200 tons of raw
sugar, Deddy Saleh, director general of foreign trade at the
country’s trade ministry, said today. The imports will be used
to address idle capacity, Saleh said.  Arabica coffee for July delivery gained 2.70 cents, or 1
percent, to $2.664 a pound in  New York . Robusta coffee for July
delivery gained $8, or 0.3 percent, to $2,602 a ton in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
