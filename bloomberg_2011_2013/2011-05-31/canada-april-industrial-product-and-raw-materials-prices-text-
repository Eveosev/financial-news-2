The following is the text of the
industrial product and raw material prices report as reported
by  Statistics Canada .  In April, the Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI) increased
0.5% compared with March, led by higher prices for petroleum and
precious metals. The Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI) rose 6.8%
as a result of a strong upward movement in crude oil prices. The
overall increase in the RMPI was moderated by a sharp decline in
radioactive concentrates.  The IPPI posted a growth rate of 0.5% in April, slower than
those of 0.8% in February and 1.0% in March. The gain in April
was primarily driven by a 4.2% increase in petroleum and coal
products and a 1.9% rise in primary metal products. Chemical
products (+0.7%) and meat, fish and dairy products (+0.6%)
contributed more modestly to the increase.  Prices for petroleum and coal products increased in April, but
at a more moderate pace than the 8.2% observed in March.  In April, prices for primary metal products rose 1.9% and
registered their 10th consecutive advance. Silver and platinum
(+19.0%) as well as precious metal basic manufactured shapes
(+15.0%) grew sharply, while copper, iron and steel, and
aluminum products made very modest gains. On the other hand, the
upward movement in primary metal products was dampened by a 3.8%
decline in nickel products. Reduced production in  Asia  continued
to negatively affect the demand for metals.  The IPPI advance was moderated by a 1.0% decline in prices for
motor vehicles and other transport equipment. The decrease was
largely the result of the 1.9% appreciation of the Canadian
dollar against the US dollar.  Some Canadian producers who export their products to the  United
States  are generally paid on the basis of prices set in US
dollars. Consequently, the strength of the Canadian dollar in
relation to the US dollar had the effect of reducing the
corresponding prices in Canadian dollars. Without the impact of
the exchange rate, the IPPI would have risen 1.0% instead of
0.5%.  In April, excluding petroleum and coal products, the IPPI
decreased 0.1% after remaining unchanged in March.  12-month change in the IPPI: The upward trend continues  The IPPI rose 5.0% in April compared with the same month a year
earlier, after advancing 3.7% in February and 5.0% in March. Of
the 21 major commodity aggregations, 16 were up and 5 decreased,
which is comparable to the distribution in March.  In the past 12 months, the IPPI advance was driven mainly by
higher prices for petroleum and coal products (+28.7%) and
primary metal products (+12.3%).  Year over year, the largest contributors to the increase in
primary metal products were precious metals, particularly silver
and platinum (+104.8%), as well as precious metal basic
manufactured shapes (+103.0%). Copper and iron and steel
products played a less important part, with respective increases
of 13.1% and 3.8%.  Chemical products (+4.9%) and fruits, vegetables, feeds and
other food products (+6.2%) made smaller contributions to the
IPPI growth.  In April, the 4.9% year-over-year increase in the value of the
Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar dampened the IPPI
advance. Without the impact of the  exchange rate , the IPPI would
have risen 6.1% instead of 5.0%.  Prices for motor vehicles and other transport equipment, which
are particularly sensitive to the exchange rate, fell 2.3% in
April compared with the same month a year earlier, continuing
the downward movement that started in October 2009.  Excluding petroleum and coal prices, the IPPI increased 2.1%
year over year in April, a rate of growth similar to those
observed in January and February, but inferior to that of 2.6%
in March. This index has recorded year-over-year increases since
May 2010.  Raw Materials Price Index: The upward trend intensifies for a
third month  The Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI) rose sharply by 6.8% in
April, compared with increases of 2.2% in February and 5.8% in
March. The RMPI growth was primarily driven by mineral fuels
(+13.2%). Following a 16.2% increase in March, crude  oil prices 
rose 14.1% in April. The crude oil price index was 32.8% higher
than in January.  Price increases for animals and animal products (+1.6%),
vegetable products (+1.4%) and wood products (+1.8%) contributed
more modestly to the RMPI advance in April.  Non-ferrous metals (-0.6%) slightly dampened the impact of
higher crude oil prices on the RMPI.  The drop in prices for non-ferrous metals in April was driven by
a sharp decline in the price of radioactive concentrates (-
17.3%), which resulted from the earthquake and the tsunami in
Asia in March. The decrease in radioactive concentrates offset
the advances of all other metals. With the exception of
radioactive concentrates, prices increased for all non-ferrous
metals, particularly precious metals (+7.4%).  Excluding mineral fuels, the RMPI increased 0.6% in April,
following a 1.8% decline in March.  Compared with the same month a year earlier, the RMPI was up
22.4% in April, following gains of 11.4% in February and 16.8%
in March. Year over year, the RMPI has been on an upward trend
since November 2009. The main contributors to the RMPI year-
over-year increase in April were mineral fuels (+30.0%), non-
ferrous metals (+17.2%), vegetable products (+40.3%) and animals
and animal products (+9.7%).  Excluding mineral fuels, the RMPI recorded a year-over-year
increase of 15.1% in April, slower than the growth rates of
20.0% in February and 17.2% in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
