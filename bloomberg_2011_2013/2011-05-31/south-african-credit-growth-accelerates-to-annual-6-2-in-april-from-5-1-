South African credit growth
accelerated in April as  interest rates  at a 30-year low spurred
 consumer spending  in Africa’s biggest economy.  Borrowing by households and businesses rose an annual 6.2
percent, up from 5.1 percent in March, the Pretoria-based
 Reserve Bank  said on its website today. The median estimate of
14 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for growth of 5.6
percent.  The Reserve Bank cut its benchmark interest rate three
times last year to 5.5 percent to help support the economy’s
recovery, resulting in a pick-up in consumer spending, which
accounts for two-thirds of demand in the economy. The bank’s
monetary policy committee left the rate unchanged for a third
consecutive time on May 12.  “The accommodative monetary policy stance of the bank over
the past few years has certainly helped to prop up household
consumption expenditure,”  Daniel Mminele , one of bank’s deputy
governors, said in a May 27 speech in Pretoria.  The broad M3 measure of  money supply  increased an annual
6.0 percent in April, down from 6.5 percent in March. The median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey was for M3 to advance 6.9
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
