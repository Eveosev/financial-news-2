Colombia ’s peso rose to its strongest
level in three weeks, a day after the central bank lifted its
key lending rate in a bid to curb inflation.  The peso rose 0.5 percent to 1,799.91 per dollar at 9:36
a.m. New York time, its strongest since May 10. The peso closed
at 1,808.50 per dollar yesterday.  The seven-member board, led by bank chief Jose Dario Uribe,
increased the benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage
point to 4 percent yesterday, matching the forecasts of all 25
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Policy makers have lifted the
key rate at each of their monthly meetings since February.  Banco de la Republica also extended a plan to purchase a
minimum of $20 million per day in the  spot market  to “at
least” Sept. 30. The program was set to expire June 17.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024 was
little changed at 8.17 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
