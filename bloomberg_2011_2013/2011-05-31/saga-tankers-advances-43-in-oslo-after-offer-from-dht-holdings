Saga Tankers ASA (SAGA) , a Norwegian company
that transports crude oil by sea, jumped 43 percent in Oslo
after New York-listed rival DHT Holdings Inc. said it will make
an offer for all the companyâ€™s shares.  Saga climbed to as much as 5.01 kroner in Oslo and
was up 36 percent at 4.74 kroner as of 1:04 p.m. in the
Norwegian capital, giving it a market value 412.2 million kroner
($77 million.)  The board of DHT and Saga entered into a transaction
agreement regarding an acquisition of Saga by DHT, Saga said in
a statement today. The offer will be 0.25 DHT shares for every
Saga share. DHT closed at $4.01 in the U.S. on May 27.  To contact the reporters on this story:
