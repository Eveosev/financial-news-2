European stocks climbed after the
euro rallied to a three-week high as investors speculated that
European officials will sanction additional financial assistance
for Greece.  Alpha Bank SA and  EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA (EUROB)  led a rally in
Greek banks, climbing more than 8 percent in Athens trading.
Vestas Wind Systems A/S led alternative-energy stocks higher for
a second day. Steelmakers also advanced after  Voestalpine AG (VOE) 
posted higher full-year profit.  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  plunged 18 percent
after the company cut its second-quarter and its full-year
outlook for devices and services.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index rose 0.8 percent to 281.06 at
the 4:30 p.m. close in London, paring this month’s loss to 1
percent. The gauge had fallen for four straight weeks amid
speculation that Greece will restructure its debt. Since
reaching this year’s high on Feb. 17, the Stoxx 600 has
retreated 3.5 percent.  “We have gone through a period in which a lot more
pessimism surrounding this topic has come into the market and we
are seeing something of a rebound off the back of that,” said
Valentijn Van Nieuwenhuijzen, head of strategy at ING Investment
Management, in a Bloomberg Television interview. “The
likelihood of an explosion of the Greek situation over the next
couple of months seems to have come down.”  The euro rallied against the dollar after Luxembourg Prime
Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said European leaders will decide
on a new aid package for  Greece  by the end of next month, while
also ruling out a “total restructuring” of the nation’s debt.
Junker spoke yesterday in Paris.  Inspectors from the European Union, the  International
Monetary Fund  and the European Central Bank plan to conclude
their review of Greece’s progress in meeting the terms of last
year’s 110 billion-euro ($158 billion) bailout in the coming
days. The EU will then formulate its plan for additional aid.  German Demands  The Wall Street Journal said  Germany  may stop demanding
that Greece reschedules its bonds so that the Mediterranean
nation can get a new package of loans. The newspaper cited
unidentified people.  National benchmark indexes advanced in all but 3 of the 18
western European markets today. France’s  CAC 40 Index (CAC)  climbed
1.6 percent and Germany’s DAX Index jumped 1.9 percent, while
the U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index gained 0.9 percent. Greece’s ASE Index
soared 5.6 percent, its largest gain in a year.  German Retail Sales  In Europe, German retail sales rose in April as
unemployment fell below 3 million for the first time in almost
19 years. Separate figures from the European Union’s statistic
office showed that inflation in the euro area slowed in May to
2.7 percent from 2.8 percent in April while in Denmark, the
economy unexpectedly contracted for a second quarter, joining
 Portugal , which received a bailout in May, in recession.  Alpha Bank, Greece’s third-biggest lender, rallied 8.6
percent to 3.16 euros in Athens, while Eurobank, the country’s
second-largest bank, surged 11 percent to 3.18 euros. Both
stocks tumbled more than 6 percent yesterday as the IMF reviewed
Greece’s efforts toward meeting fiscal targets.  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  rose 1.4 percent to 1,628 pence
after Nomura Holdings Inc. raised its recommendation for the
U.K. bank that makes the majority of its profit in  Asia  to
“buy” from “neutral,” saying the firm remains “well
positioned’ for the long term.  Analysts also raised their price estimate for the shares to
1,800 pence from 1,770 pence. The revised projection is 12
percent higher than last week’s closing price.  Vestas, Solarworld, Q-Cells  Vestas soared 3.4 percent to 156.20 kroner in Copenhagen,
while Germany’s  Q-Cells SE (QCE)  surged 7.9 percent to 2.07 euros.  Alternative energy stocks rallied for a second day after
German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition yesterday set 2022
as the final date to close the country nuclear reactors, making
Germany the largest nation to abandon atomic power.  Voestalpine advanced 4.4 percent to 34.78 euros after
Austria’s largest steelmaker said fiscal full-year profit rose
almost fivefold to 512.7 million euros as the global economy
improved.  ‘‘Further positive economic development in the second half
of calendar year 2011 can be expected,” the company said.
“Against this backdrop a further significant improvement of
Voestalpine results should be possible in 2011/12.”  Kloeckner & Co. SE, the German steel trader operating in 15
countries in Europe and  North America , gained 2.5 percent to
20.60 euros and  ArcelorMittal (MT) , the world’s largest steelmaker,
rose 1.2 percent to 23.18 euros.  Salzgitter AG (SZG) , Germany’s
second-biggest steelmaker, jumped 2.6 percent to 51.35 euros.  Nokia, Barratt Developments  Nokia tumbled 18 percent to 4.75 euros, its lowest price
since 1998, after the Finnish mobile-phone maker forecast that
devices and services net sales in 2011 will miss its previous
projection of 6.1 billion euros to 6.6 billion euros.  Barratt Developments Plc (BDEV) , the U.K.’s biggest homebuilder by
volume, climbed 0.8 percent to 113.4 pence after the Centre for
Economics & Business Research forecast that U.K. house prices
will rise 16 percent over the next four years after slipping 1.4
percent in 2011.  Wolseley Plc (WOS)  jumped 3.4 percent to 2,058 pence after the
