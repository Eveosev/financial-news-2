Grain losses after harvests in sub-
Saharan Africa cost about $4 billion a year, the  United Nations ’
Food & Agriculture Organization said in a report.  Food lost to decay and pest infestation could feed 48
million people, said Maria Helena Semedo, the FAO’s assistant
director-general, in today’s report. Grain losses prior to
harvest can total as much as 20 percent, the FAO said.  “If we agree that sustainable agricultural systems need to
be developed to feed 9 billion people by 2050, addressing waste
across the entire food chain must be a critical pillar of future
national food strategies,” Semedo said.  Adding metallic silos, providing sealed bags and applying
crop protectants will help prevent food loss after harvest,
according to the report. Localizing solutions to fit the
environment in  Africa  also will prevent losses, the FAO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
