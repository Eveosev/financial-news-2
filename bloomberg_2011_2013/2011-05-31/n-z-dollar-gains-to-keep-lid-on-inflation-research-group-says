New Zealand ’s dollar, the best
performing G-10 currency in the past three months, is likely to
stay high and help limit price gains, according to the  New
Zealand Institute of Economic Research .  “We expect the  New Zealand dollar  to remain elevated for
some time,”  Shamubeel Eaqub , principal economist at the
Wellington-based nonprofit research group said in an e-mailed
statement. “A high dollar is helping to keep a lid on inflation
for now.”  The currency surged to a record yesterday and has advanced
11 percent since early March on speculation interest rates may
need to rise after a report showed business confidence this
month at a 12-month high. Improving prospects may embolden
companies to raise prices just as rebuilding from the nation’s
deadliest earthquake in 80 years starts to fan inflation next
year, Eaqub said.  “Despite a gradual recovery, medium-term inflation
pressures are building,” he said. “The  Reserve Bank  will need
to raise rates next year toward 4 percent to offset these
inflationary pressures.”  The official cash rate is at a record-low 2.5 percent.
There is an 86 percent chance that central bank Governor Alan Bollard will raise the cash rate by a quarter point by December,
according to swaps prices late in Wellington yesterday.  The institute forecasts economic growth will recover to 3.7
percent in 2012 from 0.3 percent this year as reconstruction
gets under way in the southern city of Christchurch, where a
magnitude 6.3 earthquake on Feb. 22 killed more than 180 people
and shut the central business district.  To contact the reporter on this story:
