European Energy Exchange AG, which
merged its power business with Powernext SA of  France  in 2009,
expanded its spot natural gas markets to include around-the-
clock trading and buying and selling in the Dutch market.  A total of 36,988 megawatt-hours was traded in the 24-hour
gas market in its first session yesterday, while 528 megawatt-
hours of the commodity was bought and sold on the exchange’s
Dutch market, EEX said today in an e-mailed statement. The
exchange’s German gas trading covers the Gaspool and the
NetConnect Germany market areas.  The Leipzig, Germany-based exchange was formed in 2002 by
the merger of two regional exchanges. Utilities, energy
companies, banks and  hedge funds  trade electricity, natural gas,
coal and carbon-emission contracts on the platform.  To contact the reporters on this story:
