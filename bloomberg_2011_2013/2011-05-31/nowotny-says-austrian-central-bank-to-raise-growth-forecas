Austrian Central Bank Governor Ewald Nowotny said that the bank will raise its growth projection for
the Alpine republic when it presents its new forecast next month.  “It looks like growth will be higher and the deficit
lower” than previously predicted, Nowotny said in a speech
Vienna today, without giving details. This doesn’t mean that the
Austrian government should reduce its efforts to cut back on the
deficit, he said.  The central bank in December said that  Austria ’s gross
domestic product may be 2.1 percent in 2011 and 2.3 percent in
2012. It predicted at the time that the budget deficit would be
3 percent this year and 2.6 percent next year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
