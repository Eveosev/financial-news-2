Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  shut crude Line 6B
after a power failure affected pump stations in Mendon, Marshall
and Stockbridge,  Michigan , according to information sent to
shippers yesterday and obtained by Bloomberg News.  Line 17 was closed as a result of the Line 6B shutdown,
according to the information. Line 6A was closed May 29 due to
high inventories at the Griffith terminal and flow rates on
lines 4 and 67 will be reduced, according to the information.  Lorraine Grymala, a spokeswoman for Enbridge, declined
immediate comment today. “I will respond to your inquiry as
soon as I have an update to share with you,” she said in an e-
mail.  Line 6B has a capacity of 283,100 barrels a day and runs
between Griffith, Indiana, and Sarnia, Ontario. The 666,700
barrel a day Line 6A runs between Superior, Wisconsin, and
Griffith.  To contact the reporter on this story:
