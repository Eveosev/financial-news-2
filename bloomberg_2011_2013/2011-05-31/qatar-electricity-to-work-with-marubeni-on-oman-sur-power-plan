Qatar Electricity & Water Co. (QEWS) , the
third-largest publicly traded utility in the Middle East by
revenue, has joined with  Marubeni Corp. (8002)  to bid for the
construction of the Sur power plant in Oman.  The company expects a decision on which companies will be
awarded the project by the end of next month, Qatar Electricity
General Manager Fahad al-Mohannadi told reporters today at the
opening of a new power plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar.  “We are there and they are opening the bid this week,”
he said.  Qatar Electricity, which owns stakes in gas-fired
generators inside the Persian Gulf emirate, seeks to expand
outside of Qatar, where a rush to build new plants in recent
years has left it with 2,500 megawatts of surplus capacity.  The company was recently “prequalified” for a project to
build a 1,500-megawatt electric generating plant in Dubai, al-
Mohannadi said. The company “shelved” plans to build two power
plants in Syria because of disagreements and recent unrest in
the country, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
