Bank of  Israel  Governor  Stanley Fischer  said the central bank may raise its 2011 and 2012
economic growth forecasts for the country this week and that
Israel will meet its deficit targets in the two-year period.  The forecast for 2011 “is bound to be higher,” when it is
updated, Fischer said in the southern city of Beersheva today.
“No doubt 2012 will also be raised.”  The economy grew an annualized 4.7 percent in the first
quarter, following an expansion of 7.6 percent in the previous
three months, the fastest in four years. The Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development raised its growth forecast
for Israel to 5.4 percent on May 25 and predicted that the
jobless rate would drop to 6.2 percent this year.  Fischer said the OECD forecast may be a bit high.  To contact the reporter on this story:
