The U.K. is planning to draw up a
blacklist of the “most contrived and aggressive” tax-avoidance
programs under a proposal to be published today, the Financial
Times reported, citing Exchequer Secretary, David Gauke.  Taxpayers employing one of the programs on the blacklist
will be made to pay the disputed tax upfront or face a larger
bill if an investigation determines the program is invalid, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
