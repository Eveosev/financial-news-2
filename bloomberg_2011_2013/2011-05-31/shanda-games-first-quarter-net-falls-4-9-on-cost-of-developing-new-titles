Shanda Games Ltd. (GAME) , China’s third-
biggest provider of online games, said first-quarter net income
fell 4.9 percent after the company increased spending to develop
new titles.  Net income dropped to 312.9 million yuan ($47.7 million),
or 1.10 yuan per American depositary receipt, from 329 million
yuan, or 1.14 yuan, a year earlier, Shanda Games said in a
statement today. This missed the 317 million yuan average of six
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 9.6 percent
to 1.25 billion yuan from 1.14 billion yuan.  Shanda boosted spending to develop new games such as
“Dragon Nest” and upgrade existing ones including “Mir 2” to
revive sales, after trailing  Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700)  and
 NetEase.com (NTES)  Inc. in  China ’s $5 billion online games market last
year. Shanda plans to release more games for smartphones as the
devices become more popular, and reduce its reliance on titles
for personal computers.  Research and development expenses jumped 50 percent to
156.5 million yuan, Shanda said. General and administrative
expenses rose 30 percent to 109.6 million yuan.  Tencent accounted for 31 percent of China’s online games
market in the first quarter, compared with 15.9 percent for
NetEase and 12.3 percent for Shanda, according to research
company IResearch.  Shanda Games ADRs rose 20 cents to $7.14 in U.S. trading
today before the announcement. The stock has gained 11 percent
this year, compared with the 28 percent increase in NetEase and
the 33 percent rise in the Hong Kong-traded shares of Tencent,
China’s biggest Internet company by market value.  In 2010, China’s online games market generated revenue of
32.7 billion yuan, according to IResearch.  To contact the reporters on this story:
