Schibsted ASA (SCH)  Chief Executive Officer
Rolv Erik Ryssdal said the Oslo-based newspaper group, which
also owns free newspapers in France and  Spain , doesn’t plan to
purchase any newspapers outside Scandinavia, the Financial Times
reported, citing an interview with Ryssdal. The company’s future
use of capital will be “disciplined,” while publishers of
print titles face a “race against time to find new business
models,” the FT cited Ryssdal as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
