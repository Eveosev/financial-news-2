Indonesia ’s rupiah advanced for a
fourth day on speculation European officials will approve
additional assistance for  Greece , spurring demand for emerging-
market assets.  The currency recorded a fourth monthly gain as overseas
investors boosted holdings of Indonesian government debt by 1.2
percent to 224.06 trillion rupiah ($26.2 billion) this month
through May 30, official data show. European Union leaders will
decide on a new aid package for Greece by the end of June,
Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said yesterday.
Economists predict inflation will ease for a fourth consecutive
month in May ahead of official data due tomorrow.  “Markets are positive as  Europe  is close to finding a
solution for Greece,” said Mika Martumpal, a currency analyst
at PT Bank Commonwealth in Jakarta. “Indonesia’s inflation will
probably slow this month and that’s encouraging foreign
investors to buy more local bonds.”  The rupiah rose 0.1 percent to 8,538 per dollar as of 4:24
p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 8,531 earlier, the strongest level since May 12. The
currency gained 0.3 percent for the month.  Year-on-year inflation in May will slow to 5.94 percent,
compared with 6.16 percent in April, according to the median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Ten-year benchmark bonds fell, snapping four days of gains.
The yield on the 8.25 percent note due July 2021 climbed one
basis point or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.39 percent, prices
from the Inter-Dealer Market Association show. The rate fell 29
basis points this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
