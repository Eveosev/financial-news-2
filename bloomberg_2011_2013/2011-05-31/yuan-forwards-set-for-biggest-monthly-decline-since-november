Yuan forwards headed for their
biggest monthly decline since November on speculation the
government will reduce the pace of appreciation due to concern
the economy is cooling.  Nomura Holdings Inc. joined Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
JPMorgan Chase & Co. yesterday in having cut economic growth
forecasts for  China  this month, reflecting the impact of four
interest-rate rises and eight increases in lenders’ reserve-
requirement ratios since September. The yuan has gained 1.7
percent this year, prompting the U.S. Treasury Department to
issue a report to Congress on May 27 saying China has made
“insufficient” progress in letting its currency strengthen.  “The market is not very convinced the People’s Bank of
Chian will be very aggressive on the currency front,” said Ho Woei Chen, an economist at United Overseas Bank Ltd. in
 Singapore . “The renminbi appreciation will have an impact on
the social fabric in China in terms of the cost of living and
its impact on the export sector.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards declined 0.8 percent
this month to 6.3595 per dollar as of 10:37 a.m. in  Hong Kong , a
1.9 percent premium to the onshore spot rate, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts rose 0.02 percent today.  The yuan advanced 0.14 percent this month to 6.4819 per
dollar, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
The currency gained 0.02 percent today and touched 6.4815
earlier, the strongest level since the country unified official
and market exchange rates at the end of 1993.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the currency appreciated
0.03 percent to 6.4815, paring this month’s decline to 0.3
percent.  The People’s Bank of China raised the currency’s reference
rate 0.02 percent to 6.4845 per dollar today, the strongest
level since July 2005. The yuan isn’t allowed to move more than
0.5 percent on either side of the central bank’s daily fixing.  China’s gross domestic product will expand 9.4 percent this
year, slower than an earlier forecast of 9.8 percent, Nomura
Holdings Inc. said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
