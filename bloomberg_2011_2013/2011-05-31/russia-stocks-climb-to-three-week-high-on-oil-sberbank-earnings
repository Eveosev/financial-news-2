Russian stocks rose to the strongest
level in three weeks as oil topped $102 a barrel and OAO
Sberbank, the country’s biggest lender, posted the most
profitable quarter in its 170-year history.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  of 30 stocks gained 1.3 percent to 1,666.3
by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, its highest since May 10. The
increase pared the decline this month to 4.3 percent, a second
of decreases. OAO Lukoil,  Russia ’s second-largest oil producer,
jumped 3.8 percent. Sberbank, which has a 12.5 percent weighting
in the Micex, climbed 0.3 percent. OAO Uralkali, the country’s
second-largest potash producer, gained 2.9 percent. The dollar-
denominated RTS Index rallied 1.2 percent to 1,888.6.  Crude, Russia’s main export earner, rose as much as $2.11
to $102.70 a barrel in  New York  on speculation European
officials will approve more aid for  Greece  and as a leak shut a
pipeline carrying crude to the largest U.S. storage hub.
Sberbank’s net income doubled to 86.8 billion rubles ($3.1
billion) in the first quarter, topping the 78.3 billion-ruble
average estimate of 12 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  “Oil above $101 a barrel and Sberbank’s better-than-
expected earnings is helping Russia today,” Marco Casas,
Moscow-based vice-president for equity sales at Otkritie
Financial Corp., said in e-mailed comments today. “The new aid
package for Greece is also boosting overall risk appetite.”  Sberbank gained for a sixth day, the longest winning streak
since October. The company’s results were “impressive,” Leonid Slipchenko, a banking analyst at UralSib Financial, wrote in an
e-mailed report today. Profit was 16 percent above UralSib’s
estimates, he said.  Emerging-market stocks and currencies gained after
Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker , who leads the group of euro-
area finance ministers, said yesterday that European Union
leaders will decide on a new aid package for Greece by the end
of next month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
