South African Reserve Bank Governor
Gill Marcus said  Greece ’s debt crisis is “deteriorating at an
alarming rate” and may undermine the recovery in the global
economy if not contained.  “While some form of debt restructuring would seem to be
inevitable, and some would say overdue, the impact on the
European banking system would be significant,” Marcus told
economists in Johannesburg today. Greek, Irish and Portuguese
sovereign debt constitutes “a significant proportion” of
German and French banks’ balance sheets, she said.  Slower growth in  Europe , which buys a third of  South
Africa ’s manufactured goods, may hurt the recovery in  Africa ’s
largest economy. Manufacturing was the best-performing industry
in South Africa last quarter, helping to boost economic growth
to an annualized 4.8 percent from 4.5 percent in the previous
three months, the statistics office said today.  “Failure to contain the systemic problems could have
financial stability implications not only for the European
economies but for the global economy in general,” Marcus said.  The  Reserve Bank  cut its benchmark interest rate three
times last year to a 30-year low to help bolster growth. That’s
helped to fuel credit demand, which rose an annual 6.2 percent
in April, up from 5.1 percent in March, the central bank said
today.  “At this stage in South Africa we’re not seeing signs of a
massive build up of credit or rapidly rising asset prices,”
Marcus said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
