Crookes Brothers Ltd. (CKS) , a South
African farming group, will keep its tourist operation where
crocodile burgers are on the menu even after closing its
breeding unit due to poor skin prices and rising competition.  The company, which sold its herd of about 9,000 reptiles in
January, will keep some breeding stock for its tourist operation
and restaurant in Scottburgh, a coastal town in South Africa’s
KwaZulu-Natal province, Finance Director Phillip Barker said by
phone today.  Crookes Brothers, which started breeding crocodiles in
1985, can no longer compete with better quality skins from
abroad, he said. “The decline began with the financial crisis
and South Africa can’t easily compete” now, Barker said.  The company, which traces its history back to the 1860s,
will now focus on its farming business, which produces sugar,
bananas, deciduous fruit and grain in  South Africa  and Zambia.
It also farms sheep and cattle, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
