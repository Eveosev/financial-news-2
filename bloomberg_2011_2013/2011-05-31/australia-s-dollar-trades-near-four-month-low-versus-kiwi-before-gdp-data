Australia ’s dollar rose toward a
three-week high, snapping a two-day loss, after a government
report showed the nation’s economy contracted less in the first
quarter than some analysts forecast.  The Aussie gained against 12 of its major counterparts
after the report showed first-quarter gross domestic product
shrank 1.2 percent from the previous three months, compared with
the median estimate for a 1.1 percent drop of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. The  New Zealand  dollar fell as a
technical indicator signaled its recent rally to a record high
was overdone.  “The market did see a worse result, and the Aussie dollar
has underperformed other commodity currencies leading into the
data,” said Greg Gibbs, a currency strategist at Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc in Sydney. “So this may deviate some of the
underperformance and catch up a little.”  Australia’s dollar rose 0.2 percent to $1.070 as of 12:49
p.m. in  New York  from $1.0672 yesterday, when it reached
$1.0758, the highest since May 11. The currency fell 0.6 percent
to 86.51 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar fell 0.2 percent to 82.24 U.S. cents
from 82.39 cents yesterday, when it reached 82.64, the strongest
since the currency was freely floated in 1985. It weakened 0.9
percent to 66.53 yen.  Australia’s GDP fell 1.2 percent from the fourth quarter,
when it rose a revised 0.8 percent, the Bureau of Statistics
report released in Sydney today showed. That was stronger than a
2 percent contraction forecast by David Colosimo, a Melbourne-
based economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  The Aussie also gained after data showed  China ’s
manufacturing expanded in May at a faster pace than economists
forecast. The Asian nation is Australia’s largest trading
partner.  The  New Zealand dollar ’s 14-day relative strength index
versus the greenback was at 66.1, approaching the 70 threshold
that some traders see as a sign an asset’s price has risen too
far and is poised to drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
