Dan Wheldon earned $2.57 million for
his second victory at IndyCar’s Indianapolis 500.  The 32-year-old Briton won the 100th anniversary edition
yesterday after J.R. Hildebrand erred on the last corner of the
200-lap race and slammed into the outside wall while leading.  The 23-year-old Hildebrand received $1.06 million for
finishing second, the  Indianapolis Motor Speedway  said on its
website, and got another $25,000 as the race’s best rookie.  Graham Rahal, who was third, received $646,945.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
