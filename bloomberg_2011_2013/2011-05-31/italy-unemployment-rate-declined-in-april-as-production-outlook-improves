Italy’s unemployment rate fell last
month as the outlook for the country’s export-led recovery
improved after a rebound in industrial production.  The jobless rate fell to 8.1 percent from 8.3 percent in
March, Rome-based national statistics institute  Istat  said in a
preliminary estimate today. The reading was lower than the
median 8.3 percent forecast by 10 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey.  Italy’s industrial output increased for a second month in
March as sales abroad partly offset weak domestic demand. Still
the euro region’s third-biggest economy expanded just 0.1
percent in the first quarter, the same as in the three months
through December. Business confidence fell more than economists
forecast in May as the recovery lost momentum, while household
morale rebounded from the lowest in more than two years as
consumers grew less concerned about the outlook for employment
and growth.  Italy’s credit-rating outlook was lowered on May 21 to
negative from stable by  Standard & Poor’s , which cited the
nation’s slowing growth.  Joblessness among those between the ages of 15 and 24 was
little changed at 28.5 percent in April, from 28.6 percent the
previous month, Istat said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
