Hong Kong ’s stocks rose, sending the
Hang Seng Index to its biggest gain in seven months, amid
optimism European nations will pledge more funds for  Greece  to
resolve its debt crisis, and as coal companies advanced.  Cosco Pacific Ltd. (1199) , which operates container facilities at
Piraeus, Greece’s largest port, climbed 3.8 percent, while  HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,  Europe ’s No. 1 bank by market value, advanced 1.7
percent. China Shenhua Energy Co., a unit of the country’s
biggest coal producer, rose 3.2 percent after benchmark power-
station coal prices rose for a seventh week.
      The Hang Seng Index climbed for a sixth day, gaining 2.2
percent to 23,684.13 at the close, its steepest increase since
Nov. 1. The gauge posted its longest winning streak since the
period ended Jan. 6, though it is still down 0.2 percent for the
month. All but one stock advanced on the 45-member gauge. The
Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of Chinese companies’ H shares
rose 2 percent to 13,268.39.  “There is more risk-conviction, given easing fears over
Greece,” said  Gavin Parry , managing director of Parry
International Trading Ltd. in Hong Kong.  Cosco Pacific advanced 3.8 percent to HK$15.42, while HSBC
rose 1.7 percent to HK$82.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , which got 83
percent of its fiscal 2010 revenue from Europe, gained 2.8
percent to HK$29.25. Li & Fung Ltd., which received about a
quarter of its sales from Europe last fiscal year, advanced 2.7
percent to HK$17.28.  Greek Debt  European Union leaders will decide on additional aid for
Greece by the end of June and have ruled out a “total
restructuring” of the nation’s debt, said  Jean-Claude Juncker ,
head of the euro-area finance ministers’ group. Greek Prime
Minister  George Papandreou  said last week he’ll press ahead with
new austerity measures after failing to win backing from the
main opposition parties.  Germany  may stop demanding an early rescheduling of bonds
for Greece so that Greece can get a new package of loans, the
Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified people.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  has risen 0.7 percent this year through
yesterday as corporate profits and economic reports eased
concern  Japan ’s nuclear crisis and Europe’s debt problems will
slow global economic growth.  Shares in the gauge traded at an average 12.4 times
forecast earnings yesterday, compared with 14.4 times at the end
of last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Coal Prices  China Shenhua Energy climbed 3.2 percent to HK$38.65. China
Coal Energy Co., the country’s second-largest coal producer,
increased 2.9 percent to HK$10.52.  Benchmark power-station coal prices at China’s Qinhuangdao
port rose 0.6 percent to between 830 yuan and 845 yuan a metric
ton as of May 30 compared with a week earlier, according to the
 China  Coal Transport and Distribution Association. That’s the
highest level since October 2008.  China will raise electricity prices for business and
farmers from June, the first increase in more than a year,
according to an official with the National Development and
Reform Commission, the top economic planner, who declined to be
identified because of internal rules.  Coal companies may “benefit from power tariff
normalization,” Citigroup Inc. wrote in a report dated
yesterday. The brokerage continues to favor China Resources
Power Holdings Co. and Yanzhou Coal Mining Co., it said.  China Resources Power, the Hong Kong-listed mainland
electricity producer that develops, owns and operates coal-fired
 power plants  in China, rose 2.7 percent to HK$15.62. Yanzhou
Coal jumped 4.7 percent to HK$32.50.  Biggest Gain  I.T Ltd., a Hong Kong clothier that sells fashion brands
including D&G and  Fred Perry , surged 16 percent to HK$7.35 after
reporting a 48 percent increase in full-year profit.  Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13) , controlled by billionaire Li Ka-
shing, jumped 5 percent to HK$90, the second-biggest gain in the
Hang Seng Index.  Husky Energy Inc., a Canadian energy producer owned by Li,
said in a statement yesterday it may seek a secondary listing in
Hong Kong. Li owns about 70 percent of Husky personally and
through Hutchison Whampoa.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index increased 1.9 percent to
23,543. The HSI Volatility Index, the benchmark gauge for Hong
Kong stock options, fell 5.8 percent to 17.26, indicating
options traders expect a swing of 4.9 percent in the Hang Seng
Index in the next 30 days.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
