Paul Scholes  retired after 676 games
for  Manchester United  and will join the coaching staff of the
Premier League soccer champion.  The 36-year-old midfielder entered as a substitute on May
14 as United drew 1-1 at Blackburn to clinch the Premier League
title, his 10th championship with the team. He also came on as
a substitute in a 3-1 loss against  Barcelona  in the Champions
League final three days ago.  “I am not a man of many words but I can honestly say that
playing football is all I have ever wanted to do and to have had
such a long and successful career at Manchester United has been
a real honor,” Scholes said on United’s  website .  Coach  Alex Ferguson  told the website that United would
“miss a truly unbelievable player” who has been inspiration to
teammates. Scholes joins United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar in
retiring after the season.  “This was not a decision that I have taken lightly but I
feel now is the right time for me to stop playing,” Scholes
said.  Scholes also made 66 appearances for the England national
team, scoring 13 times, and played at the 1998 and 2002 World
Cups.  Scholes will have a testimonial match in August at Old
Trafford stadium, United said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
