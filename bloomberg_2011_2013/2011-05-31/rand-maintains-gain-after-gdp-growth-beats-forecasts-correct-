(Corrects to say GDP data refers to first quarter in first
paragraph.)  South Africa ’s rand maintained its
advance after the economy grew faster than economists’
expectations in the first quarter.  The rand traded at 6.8928 per dollar at 11:35 a.m. in
Johannesburg. Growth accelerated to 4.8 percent from a revised
4.5 percent in the last three months of 2010, the statistics
office said in a statement today. The median estimate of 18
economists was for growth to slow to 4.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
