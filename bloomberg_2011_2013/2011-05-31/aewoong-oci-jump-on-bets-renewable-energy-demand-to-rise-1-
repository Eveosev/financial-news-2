Taewoong Co., a South Korean maker of
parts for wind power plants, rose the most in more than eight
months in  Seoul  trading on speculation demand for renewable
energy will increase.  Taewoong advanced 8.3 percent to 44,400 won as of the 3 p.m.
close on the Korea Exchange, the biggest gain since Sept. 15.
OCI Co., South Korea’s biggest maker of polysilicon, rallied 9
percent. Hanwha Chemical Corp. rose 9.6 percent, the second-best
performer on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index.  Germany wants to double renewable energy output by 2020
from 17 percent last year,  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
yesterday at a press conference in Berlin. Merkel’s coalition
endorsed a blueprint to shut its nuclear-power plants by 2022,
repealing the law she pushed to extend the life of the reactors
to become the biggest nation to exit atomic power.  “The news flow from  Germany  is definitely driving
renewable energy companies higher especially after some of those
companies recently were badly hit by concerns of lower price
outlooks,” Han Sang Soo, a fund manager at Samsung Asset
Management Co. in Seoul, which oversees about $29 billion in
assets, said by phone today.  Switzerland’s cabinet this month decided to phase out
nuclear power by 2034 following the meltdown of three
earthquake-hit reactors in  Japan . Japanese Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  also pledged to generate 20 percent of the nation’s
electricity from renewable forms of energy by the 2020s.  To contact the reporters on this story:
