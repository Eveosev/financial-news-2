Novacaixagalicia, a grouping of
Spanish savings banks, is holding talks with 27 investors as it
seeks to sell a 25 percent stake in its new bank, Cinco Dias
reported, citing people at the company it didn’t identify by
name.  The lender will whittle the amount of potential investors
down to 10 in coming days, the newspaper said. While investors
are asking for a big discount to invest in Novacaixagalicia, it
won’t sell a stake for a value of less than 50 percent of book
value, Cinco Dias said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
