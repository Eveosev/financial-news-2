The U.S. Northeast’s cap-and-trade
program will auction almost 280,000 fewer carbon-dioxide permits
next week because New Jersey plans to exit the 10-state market
for pollution rights.  The  Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative  commented today in a
statement on its website. New Jersey’s Republican Governor  Chris
Christie  announced May 26 that his state will leave the cap-and-
trade program by the end of this year.  This means the total number of carbon permits, or
allowances, to be offered at a June 8 auction will be cut from
44.2 million to 43.9 million, according to the statement from
the cap-and-trade program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
