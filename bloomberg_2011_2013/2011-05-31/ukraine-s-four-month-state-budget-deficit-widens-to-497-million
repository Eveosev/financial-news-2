Ukraine’s four-month state budget
deficit widened to 3.97 billion hryvnia ($496.5 million), the
 Finance Ministry  said.  Spending totaled 93.4 billion hryvnia, compared with
revenue of 89.9 billion hryvnia, the Kiev-based ministry said
today in a  statement  on its website.  The government wants to keep the full-year shortfall at
38.6 billion hryvnia, or 3.1 percent of gross domestic product,
in order to qualify for funds from the International Monetary
Fund’s $15.6 billion bailout loan.  Ukraine’s economy expanded 5.2 percent in the first quarter
from the same period a year ago, according to the state
statistics data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
