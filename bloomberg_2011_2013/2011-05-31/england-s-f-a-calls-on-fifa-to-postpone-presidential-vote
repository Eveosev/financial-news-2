England’s Football Association called
on world soccer body FIFA to postpone tomorrow’s presidential
election.  The F.A was already abstaining from the vote, which has
been overshadowed by a bribing scandal. Incumbent Sepp Blatter
is the only candidate after Mohamed Bin Hammam withdrew.  “Events of the last few days have reinforced our views,
and we call on FIFA and ask other national associations to
support us with two initiatives,”  F.A. Chairman David
Bernstein said in a statement .  “First, to postpone the election and give credibility to
this process, so any alternative reforming candidate could have
the opportunity to stand for President.  ‘‘Secondly, to appoint a genuinely independent external
party to make recommendations regarding improved governance and
compliance procedures and structures throughout the FIFA
decision making processes for consideration by the full
membership.’’  The F.A. its requests are the ‘‘minimum that should take
place.’’  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
