China should aim to make
breakthroughs in the development in alternative energy
over the next five years as it has abundant wind, solar, ocean
and biomass resources, two people from the  Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences  wrote in a China Daily commentary today.  The Asian nation should accelerate the pace of nuclear
power development, increase the use of solar and thermal power
and push the development of its biomass and geothermal power
industries, Shi Dan and Li Qionghui of the Institute of Finance
and Trade Economics under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences
wrote in the newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
