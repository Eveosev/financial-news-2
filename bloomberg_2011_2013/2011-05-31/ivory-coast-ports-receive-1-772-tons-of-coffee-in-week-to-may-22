Coffee deliveries to ports in  Ivory
Coast ,  Africa ’s third-biggest grower of the beans, totaled 1,772
metric tons in the week ended May 22, a document obtained from
the industry’s regulator showed.  In addition to deliveries of 1,270 tons, the figure
includes 502 tons of coffee beans that were not reported in the
preceding week, the document from the Abidjan-based Bourse du
Cafe et du Cacao showed. Arrivals since the start of the season
on Jan. 1 total 10,609 tons, the document said. Ivory Coast
grows mainly the robusta variety of beans that are commonly used
in instant coffee. July-delivery robusta rose $6, or 0.2
percent, to $2,602 per ton by 2:42 p.m. in  London .  The following is a table of the amount of coffee beans, in
metric tons, as registered by exporters and exporting
cooperatives in the week from May 16 to May 22.  To contact the reporters on this story:
