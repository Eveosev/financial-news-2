Kenya ’s high court on May 27
temporarily suspended implementation of a law known as the
Alcoholic Drinks Control Act, following a case filed by  East
African Breweries Ltd. (EABL) , the nation’s biggest beer-maker.  EABL, as the company is known, filed a case challenging a
section of the law that requires alcohol manufacturers to place
health-warning messages on 30 percent of the total surface area
of the product as opposed to the 30 percent of the label, the
company said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  In June, Kenya’s government increased duties on alcohol by
20 percent and President Mwai Kibaki approved a law passed by
parliament restricting alcohol advertising and hours of
consumption.  “The interim orders will remain in force until June 2,
2011 when the case, filed under a certificate of urgency, will
be heard with EABL, the government and the regulator present,”
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
