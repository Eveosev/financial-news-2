Iceland’s special prosecutor
conducted house searches today and detained four individuals for
questioning in relation to its investigation of loans made by
Exista hf and insurer VIS hf.  “Among the matters being investigated are numerous loans
given to a number of companies and individuals in the years 2007
to 2009,” prosecutor Olafur Hauksson said in an e-mailed
statement.  Exista is a holding company that owned a stake in failed
lender Kaupthing Bank hf, and now holds a controlling stake in
VIS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
