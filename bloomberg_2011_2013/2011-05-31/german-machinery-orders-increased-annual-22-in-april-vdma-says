Plant and machinery orders in
 Germany ,  Europe ’s largest economy, increased 22 percent in April
from a year earlier, the VDMA machine makers’ association said.  Domestic orders rose an annual 16 percent when adjusted for
inflation, while export orders jumped 26 percent, Frankfurt-
based VDMA said in an e-mailed statement today. In the three
months through April, orders gained 26 percent from the year-
earlier period.  Export orders will probably slow as “several geopolitical
and economic headwinds are showing an impact,” Ralph Wiechers,
chief economist at VDMA, said in the statement. “We’ll see in
the coming months if that’s a lasting or, like last autumn, a
temporary phenomenon.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
