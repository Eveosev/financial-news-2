The next head of the  International
Monetary Fund  must be capable of helping to create a new global
framework, for the existing U.S.-led order has had its day,
Jeffrey Sachs, who heads the Earth Institute at  Columbia
University , wrote in the Financial Times.  For the past 20 years, the U.S. has been unable to provide
monetary stability, financial regulation and fiscal rectitude;
if the dollar remains the only key currency, the world will go
on suffering the consequences of America’s troubles, as happened
during the financial crisis, Sachs said.  The answer is a system based on several regional
currencies: the dollar, the euro, the yuan and, perhaps, the
Brazilian real and the Indian rupee; that means regional groups
such as the eurozone, the Arab world and the main economies of
southeast  Asia  must assume responsibility for monetary policy,
financial regulation, tax coordination and enforcement and
fiscal policy harmonization, he said.  The IMF would still have plenty to do, for the world is
“rife with lawlessness and recklessness, with tax havens and
regulation-free zones catering to the avarice of globally mobile
capital,” Sachs said.  A new IMF leader should not be “anointed” but selected on
the basis of careful vetting, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
