Noble Energy Inc. (NBL)  said it was paid
$97 million for energy assets in  Ecuador  after the government
canceled a contract last year for the company to produce natural
gas from an offshore field.  The company, based in Houston, announced its exit from
Ecuador after getting paid for its stake in the Block 3 and
Amistad fields as well as the Machala gas-fueled power plant,
according to a statement today. Noble Energy sold 30 million
cubic feet of gas a day from its Ecuador operations in 2010,
before a production-sharing contract was terminated in November.  The Block 3 field held an estimated 160 billion cubic feet
of gas, according to a Feb. 10 regulatory filing. The Ecuadorean
holdings accounted for “less than 2 percent” of the company’s
production, said David Larson, a  Noble Energy  spokesman. The net
book value for the assets was about $68 million and they have
been transfered to government-owned entities, the company said
in the statement.  Ecuador’s government in November canceled Noble Energy’s
lease in the Gulf of Guayaquil and seized the power plant in the
city of Guayaquil after the company refused to sign a new
contract giving the state greater control over gas reserves. The
government said it would nationalize assets belonging to
companies that didn’t comply.  Ecuador last year also seized Rio de Janeiro-based  Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (PETR4) ’s local oil concessions and has said it plans to
pay an “adequate” price for the company’s assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
