China  has more than a million
millionaires as economic growth, savings and a strengthening
currency helped swell their ranks by 262,000 last year,
according to a  Boston Consulting Group  survey.  Millionaire households jumped 31 percent in 2010 from the
previous year to 1.11 million, the BCG Global Wealth Survey
released yesterday showed.  China’s number of millionaire households ranks it third,
behind the 5.22 million in the U.S. and  Japan ’s 1.53 million,
according to BCG. Still, wealth in privately held businesses and
property wasn’t accounted for in the survey, thereby missing a
major chunk of economic assets in the mainland.  “This grossly underestimates true overall wealth in
China,” said Tjun Tang, a partner at BCG in  Hong Kong  and one
of the report’s authors. The survey also excludes works of art,
fine wines and yachts, a growing class of assets among China’s
well-heeled.  China ranks eighth globally for households with assets
worth more than $100 million, with 393, according to the survey.  The Asian nation’s affluent class only holds about 5
percent of its wealth offshore, said Tang, and international
wealth management companies are constrained by the number of
products they can offer inside China.  Highest Concentration  The number of millionaire households globally increased to
about 12.5 million, the Boston-based firm said in a study
released today. Singapore millionaires rose by almost 33 percent
after jumping about 40 percent a year earlier.  Singapore had the highest concentration of millionaires,
accounting for 15.5 percent of the population, the study showed,
followed by  Switzerland  with 9.9 percent, Qatar with 8.9 percent
and Hong Kong with 8.7 percent.  Hong Kong had the 10th most millionaire households in the
world, with 200,000, as well as 223 households worth more than
$100 million.  The Chinese city saw 10,000 newly minted millionaire
households last year. In 2005 it had 120,000 millionaires, BCG
said.  Wealth in the Asia-Pacific region excluding Japan is
expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 11.4 percent from
2010 to 2015, raising its share of global wealth from 18 percent
to 23 percent. Global wealth is projected to increase at about
half that pace from $121.8 trillion to $162 trillion in the same
period, according to the report.  India , which has 190,000 millionaires, ahead of 12th ranked
 Canada , with 180,000, is expected to see wealth grow 14 percent
annually over the next five years, while China will see 18
percent annual growth.  The measures of wealth are converted to U.S. dollars using
the  exchange rate  at the end of each year, boosting the value of
Asian wealth as the region’s currencies strengthened in 2010.  China ranks first among 22 emerging Asian economies as the
country most likely to maintain steady and rapid growth over the
next five years, according to the Bloomberg Economic Momentum
Index for Developing  Asia .  To contact the reporter on the story:
