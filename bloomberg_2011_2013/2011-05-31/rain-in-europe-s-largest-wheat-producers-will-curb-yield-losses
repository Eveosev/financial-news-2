Rain in  France  and Germany this week
will curb yield losses in  Europe ’s largest wheat exporters,
according to World Weather Inc.  Wet weather forecast for this week in “many areas” of
Europe “should help improve late spring and summer crops,”
Drew Lerner, president of World Weather, said in a report today.
“This week’s moisture will stop the decline in production
potentials.”  Wheat production in the European Union, which makes up a
fifth of global output, may fall 2.1 percent this year, the
International Grains Council said on May 26. The driest weather
in 50 years in France and the hottest April in at least 352
years in the U.K. have hurt yields. Germany’s wheat harvest will
fall 7.2 percent, Deutscher Raiffeisenverband e.V. said May 18.  Wheat futures for July delivery on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade fell 39.5 cents, or 4.8 percent, the biggest decline in
two weeks, by 11:28 a.m. in Chicago. Futures for November
delivery on NYSE Liffe in  London  fell 2.8 percent while the
price in Paris gained 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
