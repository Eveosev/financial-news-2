Pace Plc (PIC) , the world’s biggest maker
of digital television set-top boxes, named Allan Leighton as its
next chairman to succeed Mike McTighe, who is retiring after 10
years as a director.  Leighton, a former chairman of Royal Mail Group Ltd. and
former chief executive officer of Asda Group Ltd., the U.K. unit
of  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , was appointed a director today and will
become chairman in the next few months, the Shipley, northern
England-based company, said in a Regulatory News Service
statement today.  Pace will miss analysts’ estimates for revenue and
operating profit, the company said in separate statements in
March and earlier this month. Altium Capital Ltd. analyst Jon Fletcher said following the operating profit warning that the
company’s leadership needed refreshing.  “I’ve always felt there is a ‘great technology company’ in
there” having watched the company for 15 years, Leighton said
in today’s statement. “My task now with the management and the
board is to deliver that ‘great technology company’ and the
value that goes with it without the bumps. This process will
start with a strategic review of the company.”  Pace shares climbed as much as 4 percent to 119.5 pence and
closed at 117.8 pence at 4:30 p.m. in  London , giving the company
a market value of 358.8 million pounds ($590 million).  McTighe, who is also chairman of JJB Sports Plc, had been
chairman of Pace for five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
