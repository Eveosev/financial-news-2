Wildlife Works Carbon LLC, a U.S.
conservation business, said it received a second batch of
voluntary carbon credits for its project to safeguard forests in
 Kenya , following verification checks by Det Norske Veritas
Climate Change Services AS.  The Kasigau Corridor Project, Phase II, received voluntary
credits under a forest-protection program known as Reduced
Emissions from Deforestation and Degredation, or REDD, and was
validated and verified under the Verified Carbon Standard, or
VCS, and the Climate, Community and Biodiversity Standard, or
CCB, the company said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
