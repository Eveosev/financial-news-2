The longest stretch of declines for
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in a year has left valuations at
the lowest level ever compared with speculative-grade debt.  Earnings from the past 12 months for companies in the
benchmark gauge for U.S. equities reached 6.64 percent of share
prices this month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That
compared with the 6.61 percent average yield on  junk bonds , data
from Barclays Plc show. It was the first time the spread, a way
of comparing debt and equity values, has shown stocks with a
higher yield, according to Bloomberg data going back to 1987.  Concern the U.S. economic recovery will falter as the
government reduces its unprecedented stimulus has sent the S&P
500 down four weeks in a row, reducing valuations relative to
profits. When the gap with bonds approached this level in
September, the  stock index  returned 19 percent in the next six
months, doubling the return in credit markets.  “People will recognize that there is something of an
anomaly there,” Paul Niven, the London-based head of multi-
asset investments at F&C Asset Management Plc, which oversees
106 billion pounds ($175 billion) said in an interview on May
25. “You are better to be in equities than credit at this point
of the cycle. There is a better valuation cushion.”  Greek, Irish Bonds  The  S&P 500  fell 2.4 percent in May through last week,
after rising to an almost three-year high, as data showed the
slowest economic growth since the second quarter of 2010. The
gauge lost 0.2 percent to 1,331.10 last week after applications
for jobless benefits exceeded forecasts and an index of Chinese
manufacturing dropped to a 10-month low. Greek and Irish bond
yields reached the highest levels since the adoption of the euro
on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen.  The Barclays index of 1,073 speculative-grade companies,
which goes back to 1987, has returned 0.4 percent in May. Yields
on bonds rated below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and BBB-
at S&P have dropped from a record 23 percent in December 2008 as
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  cut the target interest
rate for overnight loans between banks to near zero and pledged
to repurchase up to $600 billion in  government bonds , a program
that’s set to end next month.  The Barclays high-yield bond index gained 113 percent
through last week, including coupon payments, since the Fed last
lowered  interest rates  on Dec. 16, 2008. The S&P 500 returned 62
percent, when dividends are included. The S&P 500 climbed 0.9
percent at 9:44 a.m. in New York today.  Profit Growth  The S&P 500’s earnings yield has fallen from 9.89 percent
at the start of the  bull market  in March 2009, while per-share
profit has climbed six straight quarters.  Ford Motor Co. (F) , based in Dearborn,  Michigan , sold notes at
5 percent in April, the second-lowest coupon at the time for
speculative-grade issues in 2011, Bloomberg data show. The
second-largest American automaker has an earnings yield of 13.77
percent, using profit from the past year.  R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co. sold $600 million of seven-year,
7.25 percent notes on May 17, a day after the commercial
printer’s debt rating was cut to junk. The Chicago-based company
founded in 1864 has an earnings yield of 8.37 percent, Bloomberg
data show.  John Paulson , whose New York-based hedge fund Paulson & Co.
made about $5 billion in 2010, cited the spread between profit
yield and U.S. Treasury rates as a reason to be bullish in a
January letter to investors obtained by Bloomberg News.  Fed Model  The comparison is a variation on the so-called Fed model,
which  Edward Yardeni  derived from a July 1997  report  that showed
the central bank used the technique to compare equity and
Treasury valuations. Yardeni, who worked for Deutsche Bank AG at
the time, now runs Yardeni Research Inc. in  New York .  The S&P 500’s dividend yield, another valuation gauge,
overtook rates on 10-year Treasuries in November 2008 for the
first time since 1958. That preceded the start of a two-year
bull market in equities that gave the S&P 500 a 111 percent
return while Treasuries gained 6.1 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg and Barclays show.  “We don’t see a lot of potential in the credit market,”
Zurich-based Thomas Steinemann, the chief strategist at Vontobel
Asset Management Ltd., whose team helps oversee about $80
billion and doesn’t hold high-yield bonds, said in a May 26
telephone interview. “The Damocles’ sword of a Greek default
may kill all risk assets, but the argument until then is in
favor of equities.”  Flawed Techniques  Valuation techniques that assume profits won’t change over
time are flawed, and high-yield bonds are a preferable
investment to equities, said  Andrew Milligan , who helps oversee
$262 billion as Edinburgh-based head of global strategy at
Standard Life Investments Ltd.  The S&P 500 was trading at 17.3 times annual profits at the
end of 2007, near its historical average valuation after
companies earned $84.67 a share. Compared with net income in the
following year, when more than $2 trillion in credit losses
spurred the first global recession since World War II and pushed
earnings down to $60.57 a share, the multiple was 24.2.  “The Fed model works sometimes, and sometimes it
doesn’t,” said Milligan, whose firm is “neutral” on equities
and “overweight” junk bonds. “Corporate bonds are well
protected at the moment. Companies have very good cash levels,
and defaults are very low.”  Profit gains have kept valuations below their historical
average. Per-share earnings in the index jumped 36 percent to
$84.58 in 2010, Bloomberg data show.  Twice the Gain  Before 2011, the lowest spread between the earnings yield
and junk bond payouts was set on Nov. 9, 2010, when it narrowed
to 33 basis points, according to data compiled by Barclays and
Bloomberg. The S&P 500 returned 12 percent in the next six
months, while high-yield bonds gained 5.4 percent.  “Equities are mispriced relative to bonds,” said Brian Barish, Denver-based president of Cambiar Investors LLC, which
oversees about $8 billion. “Companies with access to credit are
being heavily encouraged by relative  price levels  to issue debt,
to buy other businesses, or to buy back stock. There’s a very
favorable relationship in terms of relative debt pricing versus
implied equity valuations.”  Announced takeovers in which U.S. companies were the target
totaled $395.4 billion in 2011 through last week, up 23 percent
from a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Executives announced $195 billion in stock buybacks during the
first four months of 2011, 56 percent higher than a year
earlier, according to data compiled by Westport, Connecticut-
based Birinyi Associates Inc.  Earnings Yield  Before this month, earnings yield had never risen above
rates on junk bonds. The spread by which payouts on speculative
debt exceeded equity profits has averaged 5.79 percentage points
since 1987, Bloomberg data show.  Companies have sold $165 billion in junk bonds this year,
poised for the most since at least 1999, according to Bloomberg
data. Default rates have fallen to 2.5 percent in 2011, from 8.5
percent a year ago, according to S&P.  Toby Nangle, who helps oversee $54 billion as director of
 asset allocation  at Baring Asset Management in  London , said his
model portfolio for U.S. institutional clients holds equities
and no high-yield corporate bonds.  “High yield has had an astonishingly good run of
performance, and with hindsight we should have been in it,” he
said. “But we don’t find them as compelling now. Junk bonds
should have a  liquidity premium  over equities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
