European sugar companies including
 Germany â€™s Nordzucker Gmbh & Co. KG are interested in acquiring
Hellenic Sugar Industry SA,  Imerisia  reported.  Agrana Beteiligungs AG (AGR) , the Austrian unit of German refiner
 Suedzucker AG (SZU) , and London-based commodity trader ED&F Man
Holdings Ltd. also are interested in buying the unit from
 Agricultural Bank of Greece (ATE)  SA, the Athens-based newspaper
reported, without saying how it got the information.  Several of the interested parties may make a joint offer
for Hellenic Sugar, Imerisia said. Agricultural Bank is selling
units unrelated to banking as part of a reorganization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
