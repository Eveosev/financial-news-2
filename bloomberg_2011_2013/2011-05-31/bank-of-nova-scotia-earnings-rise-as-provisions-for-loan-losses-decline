Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) , Canada’s third-
largest bank, said profit climbed for the seventh straight
quarter, bolstered by higher international-banking and wealth-
management earnings and fewer loan-loss provisions.  Net income for the three months ended April 30 climbed 41
percent to a record C$1.54 billion ($1.58 billion), or C$1.36 a
share, from C$1.1 billion, or C$1.02, a year earlier, the
Toronto-based lender said today in a statement.  Scotiabank, which does business in 50 countries, said
international banking surged 68 percent to a record C$402
million because of increased lending in  Asia ,  Peru ,  Chile  and
the Caribbean.  “Scotia’s earnings continue to be rewarded from its
international diversification,”  John Aiken , an analyst at
 Barclays Capital , said today in a note to clients. The
international bank results “helped take much of the attention
away from the disappointing results in its Canadian banking
segment,” said Aiken, who has an “underweight/positive”
rating on the stock.  The company follows Toronto-Dominion Bank and  Bank of
Montreal (BMO)  in setting aside less money for loan losses, reserving
C$262 million in the quarter, down from C$338 million a year
earlier.  Excluding one-time items such as a C$286 million gain for
recent acquisitions that were applied under new accounting
standards, Scotiabank earned C$1.12 a share. That topped the
C$1.09-a-share average estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Three of the five other Canadian lenders to
report results this quarter missed estimates.  Domestic Banking  Bank of Nova Scotia rose 38 cents to C$59.36 at 4 p.m. in
Toronto Stock Exchange trading. The shares gained 3.3 percent
this year through yesterday, lagging behind the 7.9 percent gain
for the 10-member S&P/TSX Banks Index.  Scotiabank may continue to make international acquisitions
“within our footprint,” Brian Porter, head of international
banking, told investors today on a conference call.  Domestic consumer-banking profit declined 1.6 percent to
C$444 million on lower revenue and compressed net interest
margin, the difference between what the bank charges for loans
and pays in deposits.  Profit from the global wealth-management unit more than
doubled to C$489 million. The bank completed its acquisition of
money manager DundeeWealth Inc. in March. Investment-banking
earnings fell 8.7 percent to C$357 million because of higher
expenses and lower revenue.  Net Interest Margin  The net interest margin narrowed to 1.68 percent from 1.73
percent in the quarter. All six Canadian banks have reported
narrower margins.  Royal Bank, the country’s largest lender, said May 27 that
profit climbed 13 percent to C$1.51 billion. Toronto-Dominion
Bank said profit rose 13 percent to C$1.33 billion.  Bank of Montreal reported a 7.5 percent increase in profit
to C$800 million. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said
earnings rose 2.7 percent to C$678 million, while National Bank
of  Canada  said profit was C$295 million, a 13 percent increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
