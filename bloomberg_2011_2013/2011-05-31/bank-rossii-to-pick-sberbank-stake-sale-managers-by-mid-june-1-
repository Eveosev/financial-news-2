Russia’s central bank aims to pick
four or five banks by mid-June to manage its sale of a 7.58
percent stake in OAO Sberbank, the country’s biggest lender,
Bank Rossii’s First Deputy Chairman  Alexei Ulyukayev  said.  The regulator seeks to complete the sale in September to
avoid competing with other Russian companies’ offerings,
Ulyukayev told reporters today in  London . It also wants to place
the shares before parliamentary elections in December and the
presidential vote in March next year, he added.  “We have a large number of delayed IPOs and the market
will get crowded,” he said. “A number of political events that
always make investors a bit cautious” are also approaching, he
said.  Five Russian companies including Euroset Holding NV, a
mobile-phone retailer, and OAO Russian Helicopters delayed
offerings in London and Moscow this year because of weak demand.
Competition among  emerging markets  IPOs is set to rise,  Andrei Kostin , the chief executive officer of VTB Group, Russia’s
second-biggest lender, told a conference in London today.  “The supply of shares is growing and demand is cautious,”
he said.  While the central bank aims to sell its entire stake in
Sberbank, it will ultimately follow the advice of the banks
managing the sale, Ulyukayev said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
