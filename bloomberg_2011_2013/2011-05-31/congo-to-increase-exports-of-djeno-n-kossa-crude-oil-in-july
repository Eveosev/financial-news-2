The Republic of the Congo plans to
export seven cargoes of 920,000 barrels of Djeno crude oil in
July, one more than June, according to loading programs obtained
by Bloomberg News.  The country will also ship three 950,000-barrel
consignments of N’Kossa crude for July, compared with two next
month, the plans showed.  Total SA,  France ’s largest oil producer, operates the two
fields. The crudes are sweet, or are low in sulfur. N’Kossa is a
lighter grade than Djeno and yields more lucrative fuels such as
gasoline and diesel when processed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
