German 10-year government bond yields
climbed the most in 10 weeks amid optimism that European
officials will approve additional aid for  Greece  to help counter
the region’s debt crisis.  Greek bonds advanced, pushing 10-year yields to a seven-day
low, as Luxembourg’s Jean-Claude Juncker said a “definitive
answer” to the nation’s debt crisis should be reached by the
end of June. Greek securities led bonds from the region’s most
indebted nations higher, while the Irish two-year yield dropped
the most since January. German bunds fell even as data showed
inflation in the 17-nation bloc unexpectedly slowed in May.  “There is some relief, a bit of a risk-on mood, after the
news regarding a follow-up Greek aid package,” said  David Schnautz , a fixed-income strategist at Commerzbank AG in London.
“The debate regarding Greece is clearly in the spotlight.”  The yield on the 10-year bund rose five basis points to
3.02 percent as of 4:25 p.m. in  London . It earlier advanced as
much as eight basis points, the biggest intra-day gain since
March 17. The 3.25 percent security due in July 2021 fell 0.40,
or 4 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,438) face amount, to 101.940.  Yields on two-year notes were two basis points higher at
1.61 percent. They reached 1.56 percent yesterday, the least
since March 18.  German bonds have risen over the past month, pushing the
10-year yield down 22 basis points. Two-year note yields have
fallen 13 basis points as concern that Greece may restructure
its debt burden boosted demand for the safest assets.  ‘Total Restructuring’  European Union leaders ruled out a “total restructuring”
of Greece’s debt, Juncker, who leads the group of euro-area
finance ministers, said in Paris yesterday.  Greece, whose 10-year bond yields have risen more than 40
basis points over the past month, remains shut out of the
financial markets a year after it became the first euro-region
nation to request external assistance. Ireland and Portugal have
since requested aid deals.  Inspectors from the European Union,  International Monetary
Fund  and  European Central Bank  are set to conclude a review of
Greece’s progress in meeting the terms of last year’s 110-
billion-euro bailout in coming days. The EU will then formulate
its plan for further aid to Greece, Juncker said.  The Greek two-year note yield dropped 52 basis points to
24.79 percent, falling below 25 percent for the first time since
May 20. It climbed to a euro-era record of 27.19 percent on May
24. The yield on 10-year Greek debt was down 36 basis points at
16.07 percent, the lowest since May 20.  Greek Spread  The yield difference, or spread, between German 10-year
bunds and similar Greek securities narrowed 41 basis points to
1,305 basis points. It reached 1,402 basis points on May 23, the
most since Bloomberg began collecting the data in 1998.  “The speculation about a new rescue package for Greece is
driving bunds lower and also driving peripheral spreads
narrower,” said Ralf Umlauf, head of floor research at Helaba
Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen in  Frankfurt . “We have had some
weeks where bunds were preferred because of uncertainty about
the Greek situation, and now the market is correcting.”  Portuguese two-year notes rose, pushing the yield down 44
basis points to 10.94 percent, while 10-year yields fell 11
basis points to 9.65 percent.  Ireland’s two-year note yield dropped 77 basis points to
11.48 percent, the most since January 25. Bank of Ireland Plc
announced it will seek to impose losses of as much as 90 percent
on 2.6 billion euros of subordinated debt as it offers
bondholders an exchange for cash or equity. The lender was
ordered to raise 5.2 billion euros of capital by the Irish
central bank in March to boost reserves and cover loan losses.  French Affirmation  French debt fell even as the nation’s long-term foreign and
local currency Issuer Default Ratings were affirmed at AAA by
 Fitch Ratings . Fitch cited the country’s “wealthy and
diversified economy” and financing flexibility.  France ’s 10-year yield gained five basis points to 3.39
percent.  Retail sales in  Germany  increased 0.6 percent in April from
March, when they fell 2.7 percent, data showed today. Economists
had forecast a 1.8 percent gain. Euro-region unemployment held
at 9.9 percent in April from the previous month, a separate
report showed. Inflation in the currency zone slipped to 2.7
percent in May from 2.8 percent in April, which was the fastest
pace since October 2008.  The ECB lifted its main refinancing rate by 25 basis points
to 1.25 percent in April and will increase it by a further 50
basis points by the end of the year, according to the median
estimate of 28 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Euribor futures fell as investors increased bets that the
ECB will raise borrowing costs. The implied yield on the March
2012 contract rose three basis points to 1.97 percent.  German  government bonds  have returned 0.2 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by the European Federation
of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg, while Treasuries
have handed investors 2.6 percent. Greek debt has lost 13.4
percent, while  Portugal ’s has lost 14.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
