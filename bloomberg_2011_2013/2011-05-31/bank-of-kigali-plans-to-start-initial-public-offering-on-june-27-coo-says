Bank of Kigali Ltd. , Rwanda’s biggest
lender by assets, will begin its initial public offering on June
27, said Chief Operating Officer Lawson Naibo.  The company is planning an investor roadshow in Nairobi,
the capital of Kenya,  London , Cape Town and Johannesburg before
listing, Naibo said in a phone interview yesterday from Kigali,
the capital. The bank is selling a 25 percent stake and Rwanda’s
government will offer a 20 percent share to private investors.  The offering is expected to be completed in August,
Chairman Lado Gurgenidze said today in an e-mailed response to
questions.  “Given the sizeable retail offering tranche that is
envisioned, the IPO is a rather lengthy process,” he said. “It
takes weeks for tens of thousands of small retail bids to be
accepted, processed, tabulated” and settled, Gurgenidze said.  In January, Heineken NV’s Rwandan unit, Brassieries et
Limonaderies du  Rwanda  SA, became the first company in the East
African country to hold an IPO before its listing on the Rwandan
Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
