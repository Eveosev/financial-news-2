Sevan Drilling ASA expects to avoid
being affected by a possible default by  Sevan Marine ASA (SEVAN) , acting
Chief Executive Officer Scott Kerr said.  Sevan Drilling aims to convince its lenders that it has a
stable financial position and protect itself from cross-default
clauses on the 2.6 billion kroner ($483 million) of debt it
holds in common with Sevan Marine, Kerr said today in an
interview. Some of the companies’ debt agreements weren’t
separated before the Arendal, Norway-based driller was listed
earlier this month.  “One of our focus areas is running the operations on
Driller that helps to show the banks that in fact we are very
well secured and that this company can deliver on what it
says,” Kerr said. The banks don’t have an incentive to enforce
a cross default, although they could if they saw that Sevan
Drilling wasn’t able to deliver, he said.  Negotiations started with the banks to decouple the two
companies’ debt after Sevan Marine last week failed to complete
a planned rights offer that would have provided equity needed to
avoid a breach of liquidity covenants on debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
