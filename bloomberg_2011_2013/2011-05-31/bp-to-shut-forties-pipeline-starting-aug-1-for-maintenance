BP Plc (BP/) ,  Europe ’s second-biggest oil
company, will shut the North Sea Forties Pipeline System from
Aug. 1 to Aug. 5 for planned maintenance and the removal of an
unexploded World War II mine found in March.  “Routine maintenance is taking place at the same time as
the removal of the ordnance,” Mark Salt, a London-based
spokesman for BP, said today in an e-mail. “Local shippers have
been made aware.”  BP found an 11-foot (3.3 meters) “piece of World War II
military ordnance” on March 22 during a routine survey of the
pipeline, according to an April 27 statement. The mine is lying
close to the line and about 40 kilometers off the coast from
Peterhead,  Scotland , the company said.  North Sea Forties oil flowing through the pipeline system
accounts for more than a third of U.K. supplies. Production may
average 413,000 barrels a day in August, BP said on its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
