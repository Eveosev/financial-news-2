Japanese carmakers’ April domestic
production fell 60 percent to 292,001 vehicles after the record
earthquake in the nation disrupted output.  Exports dropped 68 percent to 126,061 vehicles, the  Japan 
Automobile Manufacturers Association said in a statement today.
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s biggest carmaker, said last week
its production in Japan plunged 78 percent, the most in 35
years, to 53,823 vehicles.  Toyota, Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co. are working to
restore full plant operations in Japan and at factories abroad
that are running short of parts. Toyota’s plants will operate at
70 percent of planned levels in June, up from 50 percent in
April and May. The company expects production to normalize by
November or December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
