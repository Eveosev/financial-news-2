Denmark’s economy unexpectedly
contracted for a second quarter, joining bail-out-reliant
 Portugal  as the only other European nation in a recession, after
consumers in the Nordic nation reduced spending.  Gross domestic product shrank 0.5 percent in the first
quarter, as the government also cut spending amid a widening
 budget deficit . GDP contracted a revised 0.2 percent at the end
of 2010, Copenhagen-based Statistics Denmark said today.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected growth of 0.5
percent in the first quarter.  “The figures are highly surprising,” Steen Bocian, an
economist at Danske Bank A/S, the largest Danish bank, said in
an e-mail. “The reason for the lower consumption is a
combination of higher taxes and higher inflation, driven by raw
material prices.”  The smallest Scandinavian economy is struggling after
emerging from a recession in 2009 amid declining employment, a
slump in real estate and widening deficits. Public and private
consumption fell 0.8 percent in the first quarter from the
previous three-month period and fixed investments dropped 8.3
percent, the agency said. Employment slid 0.1 percent, after
declining 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter.  Government Forecasts  Danish shares underperformed as  Denmark ’s C20 benchmark
index rose 0.4 percent, lagging behind a 1.9 percent advance in
the Euro Stoxx 50 index as of 1:15 p.m. in Copenhagen. Danske
Bank shares declined 0.3 percent to 109 kroner.  The yield spread on Danish 10-year government debt versus
German same-maturity bonds narrowed to 19 basis points from 21
basis points yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Denmark’s  Finance Ministry  said yesterday the economy will
expand by 1.7 percent this year and by 1.9 percent in 2012,
lifting its estimate for both years by 0.2 percentage point,
citing a recovery in global trade. The government expects the
budget deficit to widen to 4.1 percent this year from 2.9
percent in 2010.  “There are still considerable challenges,” said Rasmus Gudum-Sessingoe, an economist at Handelsbanken Capital Markets
in Copenhagen, in a note. “There are threats in the short term
from rising energy prices, a strong trade-weighted krone and
signs that growth has reached a peak in our most important
trading partners, Germany and  Sweden .”  House prices , which surged an annual 26 percent in the
second quarter of 2006, then slumped 28 percent through the same
period in 2009. Nykredit A/S, Denmark’s biggest mortgage lender,
said April 6 that house prices will also decline “slightly”
this year and stagnate in 2012.  Foreclosures Rise  Denmark had 411 home foreclosures in April, up from 390 the
month before, the agency said May 5. That compares with a
monthly average of 103 foreclosures in 2006, the year with the
lowest level since the agency’s data started in 1979.  Denmark will emerge from three years of job losses next
year as economic growth reaches 2 percent in both 2012 and 2013,
the country’s Economic Council said in a report today. The
economy will grow 1.6 percent this year, losing a net 9,000
jobs, and then create 27,000 jobs in the following two years,
the council, known as the “Wise Men,” said. The Nordic country
lost a combined 145,000 jobs in 2009 and 2010.  The country is also grappling with faster-than-average
inflation, spurred by rising electricity and gasoline costs. The
annual inflation rate rose to 2.9 percent in April, the agency
said May 10. That compares with a 20-year average of 2.1
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Earnings Miss  Seven of Denmark’s 13 benchmark companies have in the last
two months reported first-quarter earnings that missed analyst
estimates. Danske Bank said on May 10 net income fell to 709
million kroner ($137 million) last quarter, falling short of the
858 million-krone average estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Denmark pegs the krone to the euro in a 2.25 percent band.
The government backed away from a pledge to hold a euro
referendum by the end of its term in November as the financial
crisis left  Greece , Ireland and Portugal in need of bailouts and
undermined confidence in the single currency. Prime Minister
Lars Loekke Rasmussen hasn’t set a new date for a plebiscite.  Denmark’s central bank raised on April 7 its benchmark
lending rate to 1.3 percent from 1.05 percent following a
quarter-point move by the  European Central Bank  that day.  Portugal’s economy contracted 0.7 percent in the first
quarter after shrinking 0.6 percent in the fourth, according to
Bloomberg data.  Denmark’s GDP grew 1.1 percent in the first quarter
compared with a year earlier, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
