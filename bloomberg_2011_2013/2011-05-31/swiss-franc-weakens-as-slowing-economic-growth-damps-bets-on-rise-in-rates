The  Swiss franc  weakened against most
of its 16 major counterparts as data showed economic growth
slowed in the first quarter, damping speculation the  Swiss
National Bank  may raise borrowing costs.  The currency depreciated for a second day versus the euro
as Swiss statistics showed gross domestic product rose 0.3
percent from the fourth quarter, when it increased a revised 0.8
percent, the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs in Bern said
today. That compares with the 0.7 percent median estimate of 18
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The economy expanded 2.4
percent compared with a year ago.  “The franc’s weaker as the GDP numbers look as if the SNB
is going to be on hold for quite a while,” said Peter Rosenstreich, chief currency analyst at Swissquote Bank SA in
Geneva. “The event risk of the SNB coming in with tightening
rhetoric is now off the table.”  The franc weakened 0.8 percent to 1.2271 per euro as of
10:05 a.m. in  London . It reached 1.2102 on May 27, the strongest
on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Swiss
currency appreciated 0.1 percent to 85.12 centimes per dollar.
It strengthened to 85.65 centimes on May 27, the strongest since
1971.  The euro rose on speculation European officials will
approve additional assistance for  Greece  as part of efforts to
counter the region’s sovereign-debt crisis. Luxembourg Prime
Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said European leaders will decide
on a new aid package by the end of next month and have ruled out
a “total restructuring” of Greece’s debt.  “The idea that the situation in Greece is now starting to
resolve itself in the short-term has given the euro a boost,”
Rosenstreich said. “We could see the franc weaken to 1.2500 or
1.2700” versus the 17-nation shared currency.  The franc has strengthened 3.2 percent against a basket of
nine developed-market peers this month, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, the second-best
performance tracked by the measure after the  New Zealand dollar .  To contact the reporter on this story:
