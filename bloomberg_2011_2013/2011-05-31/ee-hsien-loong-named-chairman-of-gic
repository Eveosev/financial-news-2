Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was named chairman of Government of Singapore Investment
Corp., which manages more than $100 billion of the island’s
assets, succeeding his father  Lee Kuan Yew .  The elder Lee will be senior adviser to the sovereign
wealth fund and the changes are effective June 1, according to
an e-mailed statement today.  Lee, 87, and Singapore’s first prime minister, announced
May 14 he would resign from the cabinet, where he held the title
of minister mentor, to make way for younger leaders. The fund,
the biggest investor in companies including  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and
UBS AG, seeks to boost assets to tackle future crises and meet
the country’s long-term spending needs. GIC is ranked the
world’s eighth-largest state investment company by Sovereign
Wealth Fund Institute.  GIC had average annual returns similar to a 10.2 percent
rise in equities since its 1981 inception, said the elder Lee at
the fund’s 30th anniversary celebration on May 10. GIC will
capitalize on its global reach, multiasset class and long-term
perspective to produce good returns, he said.  Prime Minister Lee’s ruling  People’s Action Party  won the
general election with the smallest margin of popular votes since
independence. The party that has ruled Singapore for more than
five decades won 81 out of 87 parliamentary seats and 60.1
percent of the popular vote. The district held by the elder Lee
was the only one that went uncontested by the opposition,
meaning he retains his seat in parliament until the next
election that must be held within five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
