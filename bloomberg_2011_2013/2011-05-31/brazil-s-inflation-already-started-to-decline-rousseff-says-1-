Brazil ’s President  Dilma Rousseff 
said the country’s inflation started to decline without the
government taking measures that jeopardize economic growth.  “I can assure you that inflation started to decline with
more strength,” Rousseff said in her weekly column posted on
the Presidency’s website. “Everything we do is taken with a lot
of criteria and balance to control inflation without
jeopardizing economic growth and job creation.”  Rousseff said an easing of commodity prices are helping
contain prices.  The government raised the benchmark interest rate three
times this year, slashed public spending and took measures to
curb credit to bring the fastest inflation since 2005 back to
the 4.5 percent target next year. The central bank expects
economic expansion to slow to 4 percent this year from 7.5
percent in 2010.  Inflation quickened to 6.51 percent last month, breaching
the upper limit of the central bank’s target range. She also
said the government is keeping in place measures to boost
investment in a bid to increase output.  The yield on the interest rate futures contract maturing in
January 2012, the most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, fell two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 12.33 percent at 8:54 a.m.
New York time. The real gained 0.7 percent to 1.5827 per  U.S.
dollar .  To contact the reporter on this story:
