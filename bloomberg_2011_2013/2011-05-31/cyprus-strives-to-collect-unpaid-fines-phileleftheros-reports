Cyprus’s government plans to link the
police force’s database with those of government departments to
make it easier to collect 126 million euros ($181 million) of
unpaid fines,  Phileleftheros  reported.  Drivers may no longer renew their road licenses and
companies may no longer participate in public tenders unless
they pay the fines, including ones imposed for traffic offenses
or for non-payment of social security contributions,  the
newspaper said, without saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
