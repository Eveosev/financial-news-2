Indian Energy Ltd. (IEL) , an operator of
wind farms in the south Asian nation, is in exclusive talks with
a potential buyer and expects a formal offer within weeks.  “We expect to have an offer from them within a reasonable
amount of time,” Chief Executive Officer Rupert J. Strachwitz
said in a telephone interview today. “We’re talking weeks, not
months.”  Strachwitz declined to name the potential buyer or say how
much Indian Energy expects to receive. The company is seeking a
strategic investor to help grow the business, he said. A buyer
may offer to acquire 100 percent of the company, he said.  If it cannot find a buyer, the company may sell its wind
farms to raise money, he said.  “We have sufficient capital to go on for some time but we
don’t believe being in limbo is creating any value for our
shareholders,” he said. “We want to see a deal concluded in a
relatively short period of time,” whether that’s finding an
investor or selling some assets, Strachwitz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
