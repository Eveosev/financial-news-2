Asia naphtha fell for the first time
in 11 months as the crack spread narrowed. Royal Dutch Shell Plc
bought cargoes of naphtha, gasoline and gasoil in  Singapore , the
region’s largest oil-trading center.  Light Distillates  Open-specification naphtha for delivery to  Japan  dropped
$115.50, or 11 percent, in May to $977 a metric ton, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the first monthly decline
since June and the biggest in a year.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded  Brent crude  fell to
$100.42 a ton from $102.75 at the end of Asian trading on May
27, Bloomberg data showed. This crack spread is down 30 percent
this month, indicating reduced profit from making the
petrochemical feedstock.  Benchmark 92-RON gasoline in Singapore fell $15.60, or 11
percent, from April to $120.55 a barrel, based on Bloomberg
data. Gasoline’s premium to naphtha advanced to $13.90, the
highest since May 11. A widening reforming margin shows it’s
more profitable to turn naphtha into gasoline.  In Singapore, Shell bought two 50,000-barrel cargoes of 97-
RON gasoline, traders said.  Europe ’s biggest oil company paid
$126.40 a barrel to PetroChina Co. and $125.90 to BP Plc.
PetroChina bought a 92-RON cargo from Noble Group at $120.60.  Shell bought a naphtha forward contract for second-half
July from Vitol Group at $977 a ton, traders said.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil, or diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur fell $10.60, or
7.7 percent, in May to $128 a barrel, according to Bloomberg
data. Jet fuel dropped $11.25, or 8 percent, from April to
$129.10. Each product ended an eight-month rising streak.  In Singapore, Total SA sold 250,000 barrels of 0.5 percent
sulfur gasoil to Glencore International AG at 10 cents a barrel
over average quotes for June, traders said. Reliance Industries
Ltd., owner of the world’s largest refining complex, sold
150,000 barrels with 10 parts-per-million of sulfur to Shell.
The price was $2.20 a barrel over quotes, the same premium Shell
paid in the most recent transaction May 26.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude climbed 71
cents to $18.41 a barrel at 6 p.m. Singapore time, based on data
from PVM Oil Associates, a broker. This crack spread, a measure
of refining profit, lost 5.5 percent in May, decreasing for a
second month.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil was unchanged for a second day
at $1.25 a barrel, PVM said. This regrade is down 19 percent
this month, signaling it’s less profitable to produce  aviation
fuel  than diesel.  Fuel Oil  Benchmark 180-centistoke fuel oil dropped $23.50, or 3.4
percent, in May to $659.75 a ton, according to Bloomberg data.
The price of 380-centistoke fuel oil, mainly used as marine
fuel, fell $22, or 3.3 percent, to $650. Each variety dropped
for the first time in nine months.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 10 cents to
$7.10 a barrel, based on Bloomberg data. The difference narrowed
44 percent in May, the most since January 2010, indicating
reduced losses for refiners turning oil into residual products.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade was down $1.25 at $9.75 a ton, Bloomberg data showed. This
viscosity spread narrowed 13 percent this month, meaning bunkers
declined less than higher-quality  fuel oil .  To contact the reporter on this story:
