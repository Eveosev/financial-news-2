Japan ’s 10-year government bond
yields were half a basis point from a two-week high on concern
political divisions will keep Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  from
taking measures to ease the nation’s debt burden.  Kan is facing a no-confidence vote over his handling of a
record earthquake and a continuing crisis at a tsunami-damaged
nuclear plant. Bonds maintained losses after today’s auction of
10-year securities drew bids worth 2.70 times the amount on
offer, compared with a so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 2.73
times at the previous auction in May.  The political situation “is a risk factor for bonds as the
market has supported Kan’s initiative toward fiscal
rehabilitation,” said  Akitsugu Bandou , a senior economist in
 Tokyo  at Okasan Securities Co., one of the 24 primary dealers
obliged to bid at government debt sales. “The auction itself
wasn’t bad, but its impact on the market has been muted.”  The yield on the 1.1 percent bond due March 2021 rose half
a basis point to 1.155 percent as of 3:01 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan
Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker.
The price fell 0.043 yen to 99.516 yen. The yield earlier
reached 1.16 percent, the highest since May 18. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  Ten-year bond futures for June delivery declined 0.09 to
140.54 at the afternoon close at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  At least fifty-three members of Kan’s  Democratic Party of
Japan  will support a no-confidence measure in the Diet’s lower
house, an Asahi newspaper poll today showed. While that leaves
the main opposition  Liberal Democratic Party  and other groups at
least 32 votes short of passage, the paper said it had contacted
less than 60 percent of the DPJ’s legislators.  The lowest price at the auction was 100.20 yen, matching
the median forecast by 12 traders in a Bloomberg News survey.
That price was 0.04 yen below the average, compared with a
difference of 0.03 yen at the previous sale in May. The so-
called tail is the difference between the lowest and the average
prices. The longer the tail, the less bids are clustered around
the average price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
