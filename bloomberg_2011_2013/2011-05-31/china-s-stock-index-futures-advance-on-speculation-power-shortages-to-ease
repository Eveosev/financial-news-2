China ’s stocks rose, ending the
longest losing streak for the benchmark index since December
2008, as investors speculated losses were excessive.  Huaneng Power International Inc. (600011) , the listed unit of
China’s largest power group, advanced the most in three weeks
after a government official said electricity prices will be
raised. China Shenhua Energy Co. led energy companies higher as
coal and oil prices increased. Poly Real Estate Group Co. slid
to a five-month low after the Shanghai Daily said the central
bank may boost  interest rates  as soon as this weekend.  The Shanghai Composite Index rose 37.1, or 1.4 percent, to
2,743.47 at 3 p.m. close, the most since March 7 and snapping an
eight-day, 5.8 percent retreat. The CSI 300 Index added 1.6
percent to 3,001.56.  “The power price increase may help lift  market
sentiment ,” said Wu Kan, a  fund manager  at Dazhong Insurance
Co., which oversees $285 million. “The move should go some way
to easing power shortages and removing some pressure on
production capacity.”  The government will raise retail electricity prices
starting next month, the first increase in more than a year, to
curb demand and boost power generation as the nation battles a
shortage that may be the worst in history.  The Shanghai Composite has lost 5.8 percent this month, the
biggest loss since June 2010, on concern growth in the world’s
second-largest economy is slowing after the central bank raised
the reserve-requirement ratio for banks 11 times and boosted
interest rates four times to cool inflation. The gauge has
plunged 10 percent from this year’s high on April 18, a sign to
some investors that the market has entered a correction.  --Irene Shen. Editor: Richard Frost  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
