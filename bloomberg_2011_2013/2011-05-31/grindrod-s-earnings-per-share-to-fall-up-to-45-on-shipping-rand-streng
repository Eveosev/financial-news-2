Grindrod Ltd. (GND)  said earnings per share
for the six months to June 30 are expected to decline by between
35 percent and 45 percent from a year earlier due to weak
shipping earnings and a stronger rand compared to the dollar.  “The performances of the other operating divisions are
expected to be similar to the first half of 2010,” Grindrod
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
