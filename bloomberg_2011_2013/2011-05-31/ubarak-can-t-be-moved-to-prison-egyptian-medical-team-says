A medical committee that examined
former Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  concluded he can’t be
transferred to prison, saying his health is “unstable,” the
public prosecutor’s office said.  The six-member committee asked that Mubarak remain under
the supervision of a medical team in the Sharm el-Sheikh
hospital where he is being treated, according to a statement
issued by the office. The hospital at Cairo’s Tora prison “is
not equipped for the transfer of a patient in a critical and
unstable condition,” it said.  Egypt’s public prosecutor on May 24 ordered that Mubarak
and his two sons, Gamal and Alaa, be sent to a criminal court on
charges of killing demonstrators and corruption, meeting one of
the main demands of protesters who have been pressing for his
prosecution. Mubarak is accused of instructing police officers
to shoot at protesters in rallies that began on Jan. 25 and of
acquiring benefits by misusing his position as president, the
office said in a faxed statement on May 24.  The committee found that Mubarak suffers from heart
conditions, depression and “muscle weakness” and needs to be
helped out of bed, the statement said. The medical committee’s
report has been sent to the criminal court in charge of
Mubarak’s case.  Mubarak’s three-decade rule ended in February when he ceded
power to  Egypt ’s Supreme Council of the Armed Forces after 18
days of mass protests.  To contact the reporters on this story:
