U.K. government bonds declined,
paring this month’s advance, as equities rose amid renewed
optimism the European Union will take steps to resolve  Greece ’s
debt crisis without forcing investors to incur losses.  Two-year note yields also increased after reaching the
lowest this year last week. The pound weakened against the euro
as  Jean-Claude Juncker , head of the group of euro-area finance
ministers, said EU leaders will decide on additional aid for
Greece by the end of June and have ruled out “total
restructuring” of the nation’s debt. The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  of U.K.
shares advanced 1 percent.  “We’re coming toward the end of the gilt-market rally,”
said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist at RIA Capital
Ltd. in Edinburgh, a broker for banks and investors. “There
seems to be a slight improvement in risk appetite today, and
that’s taken the shine slightly off gilts. Gilts look pretty
rich at these levels.”  The 10-year bond yield rose to 3.30 percent as of 4:15 p.m.
in  London  from 3.29 percent on May 27. The market was closed
yesterday for a holiday. The price of the 3.75 percent security
maturing in September 2020 fell 0.025, or 25 pence per 1,000-
pound ($1,647) face amount, to 103.590. The yield is down from
3.43 percent on April 29.  The two-year note yield rose to 0.93 percent from 0.92
percent on May 27, paring the security’s third-straight monthly
advance.  Pound, Dollar  U.K. bonds and the pound rose last week as investors sought
an alternative to euro-denominated assets amid concern that the
debt crisis would worsen. Gilts have returned 2.5 percent so far
this year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies,
outperforming German bunds, with a 0.2 percent profit. U.S.
Treasuries have made investors 2.6 percent.  The U.K. Debt Management Office said it will sell
conventional 4 percent gilts maturing in 2060 via banks in the
second half of June, and will offer two more securities in so-
called syndicated sales in the third quarter.  The London-based agency will sell 0.75 percent inflation-
linked securities maturing in 2034 in the second half of July,
and it will issue a long-dated conventional bond in the second
half of September, it said today in a statement.  The pound weakened 0.8 percent to 87.35 pence per euro and
was little changed at $1.6473.  Resistance Level  Sterling may strengthen toward $1.6745 should it breach a
key resistance level, Commerzbank AG said, citing technical
indicators.  “Pound-dollar has eroded resistance at $1.6480-$1.6520,
the May 11 high,”  Karen Jones , head of fixed-income, commodity
and currency technical analysis in London, wrote in an e-mailed
report today. “In doing so,” the  currency pair  “targets
$1.6600-$1.6640, the last defence for the $1.6745 April high.”  U.K. central bank officials are locked in a debate over
whether to tighten monetary policy after inflation accelerated
to 4.5 percent in April, the fastest since 2008.  Bank of England 
Governor  Mervyn King  has said it’s too soon because the recovery
remains weak. The  European Central Bank  and Sweden’s Riksbank
have already started raising rates.  The implied yield on the short-sterling futures contract
expiring in December rose two basis points to 1.05 percent,
trailing a three basis-point increase in December Euribor
futures yields, which sent them to 1.87 percent.  The British Chambers of Commerce said yesterday it had
pushed back its forecast for an increase in Bank of England
 interest rates  to August from May and cut its U.K. growth
forecast for the year to 1.3 percent from 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
