The  Hungarian forint  gained to the
strongest in more than a week against the euro and stocks
climbed on speculation European nations will pledge more funds
to repair  Greece ’s finances.  The forint appreciated 0.7 percent to 266.56 per euro by
9:35 a.m. in Budapest, reducing May’s losses to 0.9 percent,
which would be the first month of depreciation since November.
The benchmark BUX index of shares rose 0.9 percent to 22,989.58,
led by a 2.2 percent gain in OTP Bank Nyrt. The BUX pared its
monthly loss to 4.7 percent.  European Union leaders will decide on additional aid for
Greece by the end of June and have ruled out a “total
restructuring” of the nation’s debt, said  Jean-Claude Juncker ,
head of the euro-area finance ministers’ group. Greek Prime
Minister  George Papandreou  said on May 27 he’ll press ahead with
new austerity measures after failing to win backing from the
main opposition parties.  “Investors’ attention is fixed on the new aid package to
be given to Greece,” analysts at Erste Group Bank AG in
Budapest including Zoltan Arokszallasi wrote in a research note.
“The EU has signaled that the country can probably count on
another assistance package, though member states are still
divided on the issue.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
