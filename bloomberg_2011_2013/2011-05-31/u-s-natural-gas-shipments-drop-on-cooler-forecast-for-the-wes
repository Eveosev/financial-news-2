Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. electricity generators slipped for the first time in three
days as meteorologists forecast cooler weather in the West that
may limit air-conditioner use.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to  power plants  in the
U.S. and Canada shows shipments declined 9 percent to 15.1
million dekatherms (14.7 billion cubic feet), according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Shipments to power generators in Texas
fell 48 percent after gaining about 12 percent yesterday.  Cooling demand in  San Francisco  and  Los Angeles  will be
less than 15 percent of normal until at least June 3, according
to Belton, Missouri-based forecaster Weather Derivatives. Power
plants use 30 percent of U.S. gas supplies.  “Across the West, the forecast has trended cooler, with
‘belows’ expected to linger across California,” according to
MDA EarthSat Weather of Gaithersburg, Maryland. The high in
Burbank, California, is forecast to reach 76 degrees Fahrenheit
(24 Celsius) today, falling to 70 tomorrow.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. residences fell 23.6 percent
to 21.2 million dekatherms after a 0.3 percent gain yesterday.  Wholesale gas at the SoCal Border hub, where gas is
delivered to the Southern  California  Gas Co., gained 42.78
cents, or 10 percent, to $4.5589 per million British thermal
units as of 2:49 p.m. New York time on the Intercontinental
Exchange.  Gas at the Henry Hub in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
rose 26.65 cents, or 6.1 percent, to $4.6245 per million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
