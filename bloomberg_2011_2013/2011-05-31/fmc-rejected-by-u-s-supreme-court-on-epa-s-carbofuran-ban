The U.S. Supreme Court refused to
question a federal ban on the insecticide carbofuran as the
justices turned away an appeal by  FMC Corp. (FMC) , formerly the
country’s sole manufacturer of the bug killer.  FMC and three agriculture industry trade groups challenged
the ban, faulting the Environmental Protection Agency for never
holding a hearing before enacting it. In siding with the EPA, a
federal appeals court said a hearing wasn’t warranted.  The EPA banned carbofuran in 2009, concluding that it
wasn’t safe even in small amounts.  The case is National Corn Growers v. Environmental
Protection Agency, 10-1031.  To contact the reporter on this story:
