Ampal-American Israel (AMPL)  Corp. and other
shareholders in East Mediterranean Gas Co. said they may take
legal proceedings against Egypt if natural gas supply is not
restored.  “If gas supply is not restored expeditiously and at the
precise contracted quantities, the EMG international
shareholders shall resort to any and all legal remedies
available to them in any relevant jurisdiction to protect their
investment,” Ampal Chief Executive Officer Yosef Maiman said in
a statement today.  Egypt suspended natural-gas exports to Israel and Jordan
for the second time this year on April 27 after saboteurs blew
up a monitoring room in the pipeline network that transports
fuel. On May 26, an Egyptian Natural Gas Co. official said the
company expected the pipeline to be fixed within two weeks.  Maiman said possible litigation against  Egypt  could be “in
excess of $8 billion” and brought against the government in
Washington and other international courts.  Ampal rose 4.2 percent to 4.32 shekels at the 4:30 p.m.
