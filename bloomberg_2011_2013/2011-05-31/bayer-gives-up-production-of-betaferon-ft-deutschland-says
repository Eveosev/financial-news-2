Bayer AG (BAYN)  will hand over the remaining
production of its multiple sclerosis treatment betaferon to
rival Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH,  Financial Times Deutschland 
reported, citing a company spokeswoman.  Ceasing production of the drug in Emeryville,  California ,
will result in the loss of 540 jobs, on top of an already
announced plan to cut 4,500 positions, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
