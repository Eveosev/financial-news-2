U.S. stocks advanced, trimming the
 Standard & Poor’s 500  Index’s biggest monthly decline since
August, amid speculation the European Union will decide on
additional aid for Greece.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and Citigroup Inc. increased at least
1 percent, following gains in European financial companies.
 Mosaic Co. (MOS)  and Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. advanced more
than 2.9 percent after Citigroup raised its recommendations
for the fertilizer producers.  Intel Corp. (INTC)  gained 1.4 percent as
the world’s largest chipmaker seeks to challenge  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s
iPad and other tablets with a new “ultrabook” laptop.  The S&P 500 rallied 1 percent to 1,344.47 at 9:34 a.m. in
New York. The benchmark gauge for American equities fell 2.4
percent this month through May 27. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  added 123.14 points, or 1 percent, to 12,564.72 today.  “Speculation that European officials will provide further
assistance to Greece is a positive trigger for an upward move in
equity markets today,” said Jens Finkbeiner, who manages about
$200 million at F+M Financial GmbH in  Frankfurt . “I’m expecting
the markets to rise further in the next few days, though the
question remains to know whether this is sustainable.”  The S&P 500 fell from an almost three-year high on April 29
on concern about  Europe ’s debt crisis and weaker-than-forecast
economic data. Still, the gauge rose 5.8 percent from the end of
2010 through May 27 amid government stimulus measures and
higher-than-forecast corporate profits.  Additional Aid  Global stocks rallied today after  Jean-Claude Juncker , head
of the group of euro-area finance ministers, said European Union
leaders will decide on additional aid for  Greece  by the end of
June and have ruled out a “total restructuring” of the
nation’s debt.  Inspectors from the EU, the  International Monetary Fund  and
the  European Central Bank  are set to wrap up a review of
Greece’s progress in meeting the terms of last year’s 110
billion-euro ($158 billion) bailout in coming days. The EU will
then formulate its plan for further aid to Greece, which remains
shut out of financial markets a year after the rescue package.  Stock futures rose before the open of exchanges even after
a report showed that  home prices  in 20 U.S. cities dropped in
March to the lowest level since 2003, showing housing remains
mired in a slump almost two years into the economic recovery.  Weakest Since 2003  The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 cities
fell 3.6 percent from March 2010, the biggest year-over-year
decline since November 2009, the group said today in New York.
At 138.16, the gauge was the weakest since March 2003 and broke
the low of 139.26 reached in April 2009, two months before the
recession ended.  Banks rallied, following gains in European financial
stocks. Bank of America added 1.6 percent to $11.88. Citigroup
gained 1.1 percent to $41.41.  Mosaic increased 2.9 percent to $72.04.  North America ’s
second-largest fertilizer producer and Potash were raised to
“buy” from “hold” at  Citigroup Inc. (C) , which cited a better
outlook for the companies’ earnings. Potash rose 3.2 percent to
$57.80.  Intel advanced 1.4 percent to $22.53. The world’s largest
chipmaker is promoting a new type of thinner laptop called an
ultrabook seeking to help the personal-computer industry fend
off a challenge from Apple’s iPad and other tablets.  Radian Group Inc. (RDN)  gained 8.6 percent to $5.20. The mortgage
insurer was raised to “overweight” from “neutral” at Piper
Jaffray Cos., which cited a stronger position on both credit and
capital.  Junk Bonds   The longest stretch of declines for the S&P 500 in a year
has left valuations at the lowest level ever compared with
speculative-grade debt.  Earnings from the past 12 months for companies in the
benchmark gauge for U.S. equities reached 6.64 percent of share
prices this month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That
compared with the 6.61 percent average yield on junk bonds, data
from Barclays Plc show. It was the first time the spread, a way
of comparing debt and equity values, has shown stocks with a
higher yield, according to Bloomberg data going back to 1987.  Concern the U.S. economic recovery will falter as the
government reduces its unprecedented stimulus has sent the  S&P
500  down four weeks in a row, reducing valuations relative to
profits. When the gap with bonds approached this level in
September, the  stock index  returned 19 percent in the next six
months, doubling the return in credit markets.  “People will recognize that there is something of an
anomaly there,” Paul Niven, the London-based head of multi-
asset investments at F&C Asset Management Plc, which oversees
106 billion pounds ($175 billion) said in an interview on May
25. “You are better to be in equities than credit at this point
of the cycle. There is a better valuation cushion.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
