Ethanol futures declined from a one-
week high, falling with corn on forecasts of higher temperatures
in the U.S. Midwest.  The biofuel followed corn lower on speculation warm weather
in the U.S. Midwest will increase corn yields. The grain is the
primary input for ethanol production, with one bushel distilling
into at least 2.75 gallons of the gasoline additive.  “Corn was kind of weak and ethanol just kind of went along
with it,” said Will Babler, a broker at First Capitol Risk
Management Inc. in Galena,  Illinois . “It’s a little bit of
weather. It’s still wet, but fairly hot.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery fell 1.8 cents, or 0.7
percent, to settle at $2.642 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the first decline since May 24. Prices have increased 11
percent this year.  In cash market trading ethanol in the U.S. Gulf gained 2
cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.785 a gallon and on the West Coast
the biofuel increased 1.5 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $2.815,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago added 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.655
a gallon and in  New York  the additive lost 1 cent, or 0.4
percent, to $2.735.  Corn futures for July delivery fell 11 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $7.475 a bushel in  Chicago . The grain has more than
doubled in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
