Three-time  Tour de France  winner
 Alberto Contador  will be free to take part in this year’s race
after sport’s top court delayed a hearing into a drug case.  The matter will now be heard Aug. 1-3, the Court of
Arbitration for Sport said  on its website . The court said last
week it was postponing scheduled for next week to allow
witnesses and experts to take part. The Tour runs from July 2-24.  Cycling’s ruling body is challenging a decision to the
Spaniard of doping at last year’s race. The  Union Cycliste
Internationale  is appealing to the CAS in Lausanne,  Switzerland ,
after “an in-depth study” of the judgment made by the Spanish
cycling federation. Initially, he faced a one-year ban.  Contador blames eating contaminated beef for testing
positive for the stimulant clenbuterol.  Tests last year found he had 50 picograms per milliliter of
clenbuterol in his body on the last rest day of the 2010 Tour. A
picogram is one trillionth of a gram.  Clenbuterol is used to treat respiratory disorders such as
asthma and can increase aerobic capacity by improving the flow
of oxygen in the bloodstream. Farmers sometimes use it illegally
to bulk up cattle more quickly.  Last weekend Contador won the Giro d’Italia, one of the top
three stage-races, for the second time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
