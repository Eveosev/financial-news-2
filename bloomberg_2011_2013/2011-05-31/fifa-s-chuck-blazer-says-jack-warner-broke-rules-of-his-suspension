FIFA executive committee member Chuck
Blazer said he reported Jack Warner for breaking the rules of
his suspension from the world soccer body.  “I’ve sent a communication to FIFA,” Blazer of the U.S.
said in Zurich, without specifying the alleged breach by Warner.  The Zurich-based soccer body, which gets $4 billion from
its quadrennial World Cup tournament, on May 29 suspended
Mohamed Bin Hammam, the Qatari head of soccer in  Asia , and
Warner, two of the longest-serving executive committee members.  They’re accused of trying to bribe Caribbean
officials with $40,000 in cash each to vote for Bin Hammam over
Blatter in FIFA’s presidential election tomorrow. They’ve both
denied wrongdoing, and Bin Hammam has withdrawn from the
election in Zurich.  Sky Sports  said Warner had urged the Caribbean Football
Union to back Blatter, the sole remaining candidate, in the
election.  Blazer said his decision to report Warner was not connected
with the Trinidadian's reported request to the Caribbean union.  “It’s a completely different matter,” Blazer said. “It
has to do with other violations.”  He declined to say what those violations were as he said he
wanted FIFA to look at the information first.  The English and Scottish soccer bodies have called on FIFA
to postpone tomorrow’s vote.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
