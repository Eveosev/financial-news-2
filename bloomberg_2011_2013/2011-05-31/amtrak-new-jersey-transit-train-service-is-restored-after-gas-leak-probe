Amtrak and  New Jersey Transit  said
they restored service that was temporarily halted amid a public-
safety investigation of a reported gas leak in Elizabeth, New
Jersey.  New Jersey Transit trains on the halted Northeast Corridor
and New Jersey Coast routes were running on or close to schedule
as of 2:30 p.m. local time, the railroad said. Amtrak had
suspended service between  New York City  and Philadelphia and
predicted residual delays, according to a separate statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
