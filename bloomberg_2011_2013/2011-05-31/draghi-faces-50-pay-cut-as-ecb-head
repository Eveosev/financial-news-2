Bank of Italy governor  Mario Draghi 
will face a pay cut of 50 percent when he replaces Jean-Claude Trichet as president of the  European Central Bank  in November.  Draghi’s salary in 2010 was 757,714 euros ($1,090,123),
more than twice Trichet’s take, the Rome-based bank said on its
 website  yesterday. It was the first time the governor’s salary
was made public. Trichet’s basic pay  was  367,863 euros,
according to the ECB’s website. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  pulled in $199,700 in 2010.  On May 17, euro-area finance ministers nominated Draghi to
become the next head of the Frankfurt-based central bank when
Trichet’s eight-year term ends on Oct. 31. Draghi, 63, who also
heads the Basel-based Financial Stability Board, is currently
the only candidate and European Union leaders are due to ratify
him for the post at a two-day meeting in Brussels starting June
23.  In addition to their basic salaries, Trichet and ECB board
members receive allowances for expenses such as accommodation.
Trichet is provided with a residence owned by the Frankfurt-
based ECB in lieu of a housing allowance.  Draghi’s successor at the Bank of  Italy  won’t fare as well
as the outgoing governor. The central bank has adopted a 10
percent pay cut starting in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
