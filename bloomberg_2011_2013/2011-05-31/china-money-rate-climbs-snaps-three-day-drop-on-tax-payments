China ’s money-market rate rose,
snapping a three-day decline, on speculation companies are
holding on to funds to make annual tax payments due today.  The seven-day repurchase rate, a gauge of cash in the
banking system, also advanced as lenders have to meet loan-to-
deposit ratio targets at month-end as stipulated by the China
Banking Regulatory Commission, according to Albert Leung, a Hong
Kong-based currency and rates strategist at Citigroup Inc.
About 600 billion yuan ($92.6 billion) of bills and  repurchase
agreements  will mature in June, he said.  “The repo rate has temporarily gone up today because
companies have to pay tax,” said Leung. “Overall, liquidity is
not very tight, but the market has been talking about a possible
interest-rate increase in June.”  The seven-day repurchase rate gained 37 basis points to
3.83 percent as of 11:30 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to a
weighted average compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center.  One-year interest-rate swaps, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, declined one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.45 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 3.83 percent government bond due January
2018 was little changed at 3.63 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center. The rate fell to 3.625 percent
yesterday, a record low for the notes that were sold in January.  -- Andrea Wong . Editors: Simon Harvey, Ven Ram  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
