The  Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission  lacks comprehensive legal authority to quickly
respond to cyber attacks on the network that distributes
electric power, a top agency official said.  FERC’s jurisdiction for the electric grid doesn’t extend to
Alaska, Hawaii or local electricity distribution facilities,
Joseph McClelland, director of the Office of Electric
Reliability, said today at a House committee hearing in
Washington.  The lack of agency oversight “may leave significant
facilities vulnerable to the threat of a cyber or physical
attack,” McClelland said in his prepared testimony.  Congress is considering legislation to bolster the security
of the grid. McClelland said any new legislation should allow
the government to take pre-emptive action to avoid an attack.  To contact the reporter on this story:
