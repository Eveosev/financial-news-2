Cotton futures rose the most in five
months on mounting concern that adverse weather will slash
output in the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter.  Orange juice 
fell.  Conditions in  Texas , the biggest U.S. producer, range from
“abnormally dry” to “exceptional” drought, the most-severe
ranking on the  U.S. Drought Monitor . Cotton futures for December
delivery, the contract with the highest open interest, rose 8.1
percent last week.  “Everyone was waiting to see what would happen with the
weather and production, and the news wasn’t good,” said  Mike Stevens , an independent trader in Mandeville, Louisiana. “This
is a critical period, and it looks like we have weak supply.”  Cotton for December delivery rose the exchange limit of 6
cents, or 4.6 percent, to settle at $1.355 a pound at 2:37 p.m.
on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . That’s the biggest gain for a
most-active contract since Dec. 3.  Orange-juice futures for July delivery fell 2.85 cents, or
1.5 percent, to $1.825 a pound.  The markets were closed yesterday for a U.S. holiday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
