Pork imports by South  Korea , the
third-biggest buyer of U.S. supplies, soared in the first
quarter after the country’s worst foot-and-mouth outbreak cut
output, helping meat processors such as  Smithfield Foods Inc. (SFD)   Shipments jumped 85 percent to 81,154 metric tons in the
first three months, with purchases from the U.S. more than
tripling, according to the Korea Meat Trade Association. The
pace may slow in the second half as inventories climb and zero-
tariff measures end on June 30, according to an importer group.  Increased demand from Korea helped hog futures in Chicago
climb in April to the highest level since at least 1986. The
country’s pig herd slumped by about a third because of disease
and culling, boosting local pork prices and sending inflation in
March to the highest level since 2008.  “Imports rose more than expected,” said Choi Jong Sun,
chairman of the Korea Meat Importers’ Association. “Importers
snapped up purchases on expectations that demand will rise after
the foot-and-mouth outbreak and the tariff removal.”  Hog futures, which touched $1.0435 per pound on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange on April 1, have gained 11 percent this year,
closing at 88.6 cents on May 27. Demand from  South Korea  is
“underneath this market,”  Don Roose , president of U.S.
Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines ,  Iowa , said on Feb. 25,
before the price rallied 17 percent the following month.  Output Drops  Pork production in South Korea may drop 32 percent to
760,000 tons this year from an estimated 1.11 million tons in
2010, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s  Foreign Agricultural
Service  said March 7. Imports may jump as much as 20 percent
this year from 179,500 tons in 2010, Choi forecast in January.  Shipments from the U.S. soared 209 percent to 37,621 tons
in the first quarter, the trade data show. Canada was the
second-biggest supplier, selling 11,484 tons. Korea was the
third-biggest market for U.S. pork in March, said the USDA.  Export markets “only look to be very solid to getting
better,” Smithfield Chief Executive Officer C. Larry Pope said
on a conference call on May 17. “We’ve had incidences in  Japan 
with the tsunami and the impact on the pork market, the
incidence with foot-and-mouth disease in Korea. There could
always be the wild card.”  Smithfield shares have gained about 20 percent over the
past year, closing at $20.67 on May 27.  Livestock Industry  The Korean livestock industry may be “sluggish for a long
time” after the outbreak, Kim Chi Young, a director at the
Korea Feed Association, said on May 23. “It will probably take
a long while for the pork industry, in particular, to recover.”  The monthly wholesale price of pork gained 64 percent on
average in the first quarter,  data  from the trade association
show. Korea’s consumer prices rose 4.2 percent in April from a
year earlier, the fourth-straight month exceeding the central
bank’s target of 2 percent to 4 percent through 2012.  The government increased tariff-free imports of pork by
20,000 tons to 130,000 tons in the first half, the Ministry of
Strategy and Finance said on May 3.  Import growth may slow in the second half unless the
government extends the zero-tariff rate or expands the scope of
the measure as importers have high inventories at present, said
the importer group’s Choi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
