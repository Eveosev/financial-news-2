Indian stocks climbed, paring the
benchmark index’s biggest monthly loss since January, as gains
in Asian equities prompted some investors to overlook data that
showed the nation’s economic expansion slowed last quarter.  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index gained 1.4 percent, heading for
its highest close since May 12 amid speculation European
officials will sanction more assistance for  Greece .  India ’s

ended March from a year earlier, after a revised 8.3 percent
gain in the previous quarter, the Central Statistical Office
said in a statement in  New Delhi  today.  HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB) , the
nation’s second-largest private lender, jumped 3.2 percent,
pacing gains among lenders.  ITC Ltd. (ITC) , Asia’s second-largest
cigarette maker by market value, rallied 2.9 percent.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index added 274.01, or
1.5 percent, to 18,506.07 according to preliminary closing
prices as of 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai. The gauge has lost 3.3 percent
this month, the most since the 11 percent slump in January. The
S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd.
rallied 1.6 percent to 5,561.15. Its June futures traded at
5,552.20. The BSE 200 Index added 1.6 percent.  Overseas investors bought a net 2.54 billion rupees of
Indian equities on May 27, paring total outflows from equities
