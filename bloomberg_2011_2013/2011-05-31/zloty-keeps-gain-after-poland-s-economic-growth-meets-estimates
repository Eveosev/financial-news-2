The zloty stayed stronger versus the
euro after a report showed  Poland ’s economy expanded last
quarter at the pace predicted by economists.  The zloty advanced 0.5 percent to 3.9584 per euro as of
10:05 a.m. in Warsaw. Gross domestic product expanded at an
annual 4.4 percent rate in the first quarter, the Warsaw-based
Central Statistical Office reported today. That matches the 4.4
percent median estimate of 26 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
