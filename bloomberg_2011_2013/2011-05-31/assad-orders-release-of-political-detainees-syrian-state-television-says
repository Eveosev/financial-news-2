Syrian President Bashar al-Assad
ordered the release of political detainees including members of
the banned Muslim Brotherhood movement, state television
reported today.  “The pardon includes members of all political currents,
including the Muslim Brotherhood,” the television said. The
step also cuts in half prison sentences for some common crimes
committed before May 31, it said.  Protests against Assad’s rule have swept the country,
inspired by the uprisings that ousted the longtime rulers of
Egypt and  Tunisia . Syrian security forces have killed more than
1,100 people and detained more than 10,000, human-rights groups
say. The government blames the protests on Islamic militants and
foreign provocateurs.  Assad had ordered the release on April 10 of 191 people
detained during the unrest. The uprising in  Syria  drew initial
pledges of reform from the president, who lifted an emergency
law in place since 1963 and named a new government. He hasn’t
repeated the assurances in recent weeks as security forces
stepped up their assaults.  The Muslim Brotherhood has been banned in Syria since the
1963 coup that brought to power the secular Baath party, which
continues to rule the country. Membership of the Muslim
Brotherhood is punishable by death under Syrian law.  To contact the reporters on this story:
