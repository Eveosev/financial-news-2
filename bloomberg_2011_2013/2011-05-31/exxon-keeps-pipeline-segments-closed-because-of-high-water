Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  said it is keeping
three oil  pipeline segments  shut near  Baton Rouge , Louisiana,
because of high water.  “The pipelines are still shut down, the water is still
high in area,” Patricia Errico, a spokeswoman for ExxonMobil
Pipeline Co. in Houston, said in an e-mail. Exxon said on May 13
it was shutting two 12-inch crude oil lines and a 16-inch
products pipeline to reduce risk of damage from flooding along
the Mississippi River.  The crude line segments supply Exxon’s Baton Rouge refinery
and  Alon USA Energy Inc. (ALJ) ’s Krotz Springs plant. The products
pipeline originates at the Baton Rouge refinery, according to
Exxon’s  website .  Alon shut its 83,000-barrel-a-day refinery near Krotz
Springs on May 23 because of supply disruptions caused by rising
water levels on the Atchafalaya River. The company said it would
reopen in June.  Exxon’s Baton Rouge refinery is the second-largest in the
U.S. with a capacity of 525,500 barrels a day. The plant is on
the east bank of the  Mississippi .  To contact the reporter on this story:
