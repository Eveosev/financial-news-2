Iron ore  prices will face “downward
pressure” in the next three months because of increasing supply
from  Brazil  and weakening global steel demand, Standard
Chartered Plc said.  There is also a risk of iron ore destocking in China,
Standard Chartered analyst Judy Zhu wrote in a report dated
today. Spot iron ore, Indian origin, will be $170 a metric ton
in the third quarter compared with $175 a ton in the second
quarter, according to the report.  “Softer steel markets in many regions have negatively
impacted  market sentiment ,” Zhu wrote. “We expect modest
declines in spot iron-ore prices in the next three months as
Brazil’s exports recover further and demand enters the off-peak
season with the start of the summer holidays in Europe and the
U.S.”  China , the world’s biggest consumer of iron ore to make
steel, produced about 47 percent of the world’s output of the
metal in April, according to the World Steel Association.
Production may fall from next month as the country rations
power, forcing mills to reduce manufacturing, RS Platou Markets
AS in Oslo said on May 25.  Vale SA, the world’s biggest iron ore producer, is based in
Rio de Janeiro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
