Venture-capital firms are showing
greater interest in U.S. higher education because as a system,
it’s no longer working, said Sebastian Thrun, co-founder of
online learning company Udacity Inc.  “Education is broken. Face it,” said Thrun, a Stanford
University research professor who helped create Google Inc.’s
self-driving car. “It is so broken at so many ends, it requires
a little bit of Silicon Valley magic,” he said in an interview
today at Bloomberg’s Next Big Thing summit in Half Moon Bay,
 California .  Udacity, which has received funding from Andreessen
Horowitz and Charles River Ventures, is among providers of
massive open online courses, or MOOCs, that are sweeping across
higher education. Competitor Coursera Inc., started by two other
Stanford computer-science professors, has backing from  New
Enterprise Associates  and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. EdX,
a third provider, was formed last year by  Harvard University  and
the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology .  “If you look at Stanford, they are wonderful but they are
small, by choice,” Thrun said. “What is missing is scale.”  Thrun said the tens of thousands of people around the world
who took one of his classes on artificial intelligence online
would never have been accepted to Stanford.  “Reaching people that are left out of high-quality
education will change the world,” he said.  Bloomberg LP, the parent of  Bloomberg News , is an investor
in Andreessen Horowitz.  To contact the reporter on this story:
