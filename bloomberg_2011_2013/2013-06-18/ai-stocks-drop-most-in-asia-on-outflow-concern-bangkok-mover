Thailand ’s  stocks  fell, reversing
earlier gains, amid speculation overseas investors may add to
the biggest monthly net sales in almost two years.  The benchmark  SET Index (SET)  slid 3 percent to close at
1,427.42, the steepest loss in a week and the most among Asian
benchmark indexes.  Siam Commercial Bank Pcl (SCB) , the nation’s third-biggest lender by total assets, and PTT Pcl were the biggest
drags on the index. All but one of the gauge’s 27 industry
groups retreated.  “More pressure from foreign selling is likely,” Veera Vutthikongsirigool, chief investment officer at Krung Thai Asset
Management Co., which oversees about $14 billion of investments,
said today. “Market volatility will remain high.”  Foreign investors sold a net $1 billion of Thai shares in
June through yesterday, the most for a month since August 2011,
according to exchange  data  compiled by Bloomberg. The SET has
plunged 13 percent since May 22, when Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben S. Bernanke said U.S. policy makers may scale back stimulus
efforts if the employment outlook improves sufficiently.  The recent declines pared the SET gauge’s gain this year to
2.6 percent, after the measure surged 36 percent in 2012.  Siam Commercial sank 4 percent to 167 baht. PTT tumbled 2.4
percent to 321 baht.  To contact the reporter on this story:
