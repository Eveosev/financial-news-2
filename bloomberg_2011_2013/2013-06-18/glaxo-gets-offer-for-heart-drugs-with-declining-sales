GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  said  Aspen
Pharmacare Holdings Ltd. (APN)  made an offer for branded heart
medicines Arixtra and Fraxiparine and a related manufacturing
site as it seeks to sell older medicines with declining sales.  The products generated about 420 million pounds ($656
million) in global revenue in 2012 compared with 510 million
pounds the previous year, Simon Steel, a spokesman for London-based Glaxo, said by phone today. The sale excludes rights to
the products in China, India and Pakistan, Glaxo said in a
statement.  Glaxo owns an 19 percent stake in Aspen, a Johannesburg-based maker and distributor of generic medicines. Aspen shares
rose 4.6 percent to 193.55 rand by 2:45 p.m. in Johannesburg.  Arixtra and Fraxiparine are part of a portfolio of more
than 50 older products that Glaxo has carved out into a separate
unit, according to Steel. The decision follows a similar move by
 Pfizer Inc. (PFE) , which is considering splitting its branded and
generic-drug businesses into separate units.  “The proposed transaction is aligned to Glaxo’s strategy
of focusing on products with the most growth potential and the
delivery of its pipeline,” the company said.  The manufacturing site is located in Notre Dame de
Bondeville in northern  France , according to Glaxo, which
declined to disclose the financial terms of the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
