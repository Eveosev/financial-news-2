Ascent Solar Technologies Inc. (ASTI) , the
U.S. thin-film photovoltaic manufacturer that’s shifting its
focus to consumer electronics, will receive $6 million from a
private investor in  Asia .  Ascent, based in Thornton,  Colorado , will issue Series A
preferred stock that may be converted into 7.5 million common
shares for 80 cents each, according to a statement today. The
company also will issue three-year warrants to acquire an
additional 2.63 million shares at 90 cents each.  The company rose 4 percent to 78 cents at the close in New
York.  Ascent plans to use the funds to expand its line of
EnerPlex consumer products, which includes a solar charging case
for Apple Inc.’s iPhone.  The first of three funding tranches, worth $1 million, is
expected to close this week and the remainder will occur after a
registration statement is declared effective by the Securities &
Exchange Commission, according to the statement.  Ascent hasn’t reported a profitable quarter since it went
public in 2006, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. The
company also is pursuing transportation, aerospace and off-grid
applications for its products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
