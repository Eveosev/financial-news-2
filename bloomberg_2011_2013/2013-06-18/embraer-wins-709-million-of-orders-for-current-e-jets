Embraer SA (EMBR3) , the Brazilian planemaker
upgrading its signature family of regional jets, won $709
million of orders from four airlines for the current versions,
Chief Executive Officer Frederico Curado said.  Conviasa will take seven E-190s, while Air Lituanica will
receive four of the jets and Air Costa will order one, Curado
said today in an interview at the  Paris Air Show . Japan Airlines
Co. bought four of the smaller E-170 variant, he said.  The orders follow yesterday’s introduction of the so-called
E2 versions of Embraer’s E-Jets regional lineup at the Paris
expo, the industry’s biggest trade event. SkyWest Inc. and
International Lease Finance Corp. are among buyers placing 365
firm orders and commitments for the new aircraft, which will
arrive later this decade.  “My sales priority is the existing family,” Curado said.  The E-170 has a list price of $38.7 million and seats  70 to
78 people , according to the website of  Sao Jose dos Campos ,
Brazil-based Embraer. The E-190 carries a $46.2 million list
price and can hold as many as 114 passengers, Embraer has said.
Airlines typically buy at a discount.  To contact the reporters on this story:
