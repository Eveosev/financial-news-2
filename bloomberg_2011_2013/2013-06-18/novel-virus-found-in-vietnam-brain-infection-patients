Researchers have discovered a new
virus in patients in  Vietnam  suffering from severe brain
infections, a team of scientists reported today in mBio, the
journal of the  American Society for Microbiology .  The virus was detected in 28 of 644 patients who had severe
brain infections and none of 122 patients who had non-infectious
brain disorders, according to researchers at the Oxford
University Clinical Research Unit,  Wellcome Trust  South East
Asia Major Overseas Programme and the Academic Medical Center,
University of Amsterdam. It’s tentatively called CyCV-VN and is
part of a group of viruses known as Circoviridae known to
circulate in animals such as birds and pigs, they said.  “We don’t yet know whether this virus is responsible for
causing the serious brain infections we see in these patients,
but finding an infectious agent like this in a normally sterile
environment like the fluid around the brain is extremely
important,” Rogier van Doorn, head of emerging infections at
the Wellcome Trust Vietnam Research Programme and Oxford
University Clinical Research Unit Hospital for Tropical Diseases
in Vietnam, said in a statement.  Brain infections can be fatal and may leave people who
survive them with severe disabilities, the researchers said.
Bacteria, parasites, fungi and viruses can cause the infections,
though doctors can’t pinpoint the cause of more than half of
them.  The study was funded by the Wellcome Trust, the  European
Union  and the  Li Ka-Shing  Foundation-University of Oxford Global
Health Programme.  To contact the reporter on this story:
