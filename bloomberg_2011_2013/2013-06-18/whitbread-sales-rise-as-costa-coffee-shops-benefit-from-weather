Whitbread Plc (WTB) , the owner of Premier
Inn budget hotels and Costa coffee shops, said like-for-like
sales climbed 3.1 percent in the 13 weeks to May 30 as the
wintery British weather forced consumers indoors.  Sales at Costa outlets open at least a year rose 8 percent
because of unseasonably cold conditions, the Dunstable, England-based company said today in a statement. Like-for-like sales at
Premier Inn rose 2.7 percent.  Whitbread has been growing its business while competitor
Travelodge Ltd., another budget hotel chain, has been focused on
restructuring its debt. Whitbread shares climbed as much as 4.8
percent to 3,064 pence in London, the highest since January
1992.  “We aren’t seeing any more competition,” Chief Executive
Officer Andy Harrison said on a conference call today. Whitbread
has taken 10 or 12 sites from Travelodge’s development pipeline,
he said.  Premier Inn reported a 1.7 percent increase in revenue per
available room, an industry gauge of profitability, to 42.57
pounds ($50), Whitbread said.  The update “lays solid foundations for another strong
year,” analysts at Deutsche Bank said in an emailed note. “If
the positive hotel and Costa trading momentum is maintained, we
think forecast risks are to the upside.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
