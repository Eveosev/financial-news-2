Hog futures advanced for the first
time in four sessions on speculation that animal supplies in the
U.S. may shrink. Cattle prices fell.  Wholesale  pork  rose 0.5 percent to $1.0482 a pound
yesterday, the highest since Aug. 22, 2011,  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data show. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, a hog
disease that has spread to at least 11 states, may slow weight
gain and shrink hog litters, said Lawrence Kane, a senior market
adviser at Stewart-Peterson Group.  Prices are up on “the concern of the supply getting
tighter with this hog disease,” Kane said in a telephone
interview from  Yates City ,  Illinois . “It’s an unknown, and it’s
scary to us right now.”  Hog futures for August settlement rose 1 percent to 97.6
cents a pound at 10:16 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
The August contract gained 0.2 percent this year through
yesterday.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported a detection of
PEDV on May 17 and noted that it doesn’t affect people and is
not a food-safety concern. Spot  hogs  added 0.4 percent to 99.58
cents a pound yesterday, the sixth gain in seven sessions,
government data show.  Cattle futures for August delivery declined 0.1 percent to
$1.1915 a pound in  Chicago . Prices were down 9.9 percent this
year through yesterday.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement slipped 0.3
percent to $1.44075 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
