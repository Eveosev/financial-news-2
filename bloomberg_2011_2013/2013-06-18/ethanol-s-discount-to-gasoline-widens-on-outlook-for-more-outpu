Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
expanded on speculation that the longest streak of positive
returns for making the biofuel since 2011 will prompt companies
to boost output.  The spread widened 1.06 cents to 36.17 cents a gallon at 11
a.m.  New York  time as the corn crush spread, or the cost
difference between a gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to
make it, grew to 6 cents, compared with minus 33 cents on Jan.
2, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Ethanol producers will keep as much of their ethanol
capacity producing as long as there’s a profit,” said Larry
Johnson, owner of LLJ Consulting and Business Development in
Cologne,  Minnesota . “There’s an operating margin. Profit is
better than most of last year.”  Denatured ethanol for July delivery rose 0.6 cent to $2.511
a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices are up 15 percent
this year.  Gasoline for July delivery advanced 1.66 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.8727 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 94 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool on June 7, up from 89 percent the previous
week, EIA said.  Ethanol Production  Production has climbed 15 percent to 884,000 barrels a day
in the week ended June 7 from a record-low 770,000 barrels a day
in January, data from the Energy Information Administration
show.  Stockpiles of the biofuel that week fell 2.6 percent to 16
million barrels, the lowest level in records going back to June
2010, said the EIA, the Energy Department’s analytical arm.  Last summer’s drought pushed corn prices to a record and
forced ethanol companies to reduce operations.  Corn for July delivery fell 0.75 cent to $6.6775 a bushel
in  Chicago .  Johnson said he expects ethanol production to increase
gradually during the summer and into the corn harvest in
September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
