Thunder Horse  and other Gulf Coast
crudes traded at the smallest premiums to benchmark West Texas
Intermediate in more than two years, following gains by WTI
against Brent oil.  Brent’s  premium  to WTI shrank to $7.37 a barrel at 2:45
p.m. in New York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. When
WTI strengthens against Brent, it often weakens the value of
U.S. grades that compete with foreign crudes priced against the
international benchmark.  “With WTI-Brent and also with these spreads, you’ve got to
look at historicals,” said  Andrew Lebow , a senior vice
president at Jefferies Bache LLC in New York. “You’re getting
back into levels that we’ve seen throughout this decade, at
last.”  The premium for Thunder Horse, which has a lower sulfur
content than other Gulf crudes like Mars, Poseidon and Southern
Green Canyon, declined 50 cents a barrel to $4.90 over WTI at
1:54 p.m.  The premiums for Light Louisiana Sweet and Heavy Louisiana
Sweet over WTI fell by 25 cents and 35 cents, respectively, to
$8 a barrel.  Eugene Island crude’s premium narrowed by 30 cents to $4.65
a barrel over WTI, and Bonito Sour weakened by 45 cents to $4.75
over WTI.  Poseidon’s premium shrank 35 cents to $1.30 a barrel, and
Mars Blend weakened 40 cents, to $2 a barrel over WTI. Southern
Green Canyon fell 40 cents a barrel to a $1 premium.  Bakken fell 25 cents a barrel to a premium of $2 against
WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
