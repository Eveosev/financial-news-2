Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE) , the Canadian
oil and gas producer with refineries in the U.S., will increase
the amount of oil it moves by rail fivefold by the end of 2014.  Cenovus ships 6,000 barrels of oil each day by train. By
yearâ€™s end, it plans to increase that to 10,000, and then triple
it to 30,000 by the end of 2014, said Brett Harris, a Cenovus
spokesman.  Cenovus announced the shift during an investor presentation
at its headquarters in Calgary. Eight hundred cars have been
leased, 300 of which will have heated coils and are able to
carry heavy bitumen crude, said Harris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
