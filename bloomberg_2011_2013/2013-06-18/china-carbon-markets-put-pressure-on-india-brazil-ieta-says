Jeff Swartz, director for
international policy at the International  Emissions Trading 
Association in Brussels, comments on how  China ’s carbon markets
will place pressure on other emerging nations to deal with their
output of heat-trapping gases. He commented by phone on June 14.
China started today a test carbon market in Shenzhen, the first
of seven.  On the probable impact of China’s markets on other nations: “It
puts pressure on other countries including Brazil, India and
 Russia ” to cut their emissions.  On China’s challenges:  “The role of offsets needs to be defined. There’s no
process for a trader to open an account. The legal framework is
still a little murky. We still don’t know what the emissions
target is. Clearly there is a lot of work to do. Eventually, all
the kinks will be worked out,” Swartz said. China is seeking
respectful criticism of its plans, he said.  On China’s attitude to carbon markets:  “They are interested how to make money out of emissions
trading. These pilots are an experimental period for China. It’s
remarkable how quickly China has embraced emissions trading”
because it was skeptical about it when the  Kyoto Protocol  was
being negotiated in the mid-1990s, Swartz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
