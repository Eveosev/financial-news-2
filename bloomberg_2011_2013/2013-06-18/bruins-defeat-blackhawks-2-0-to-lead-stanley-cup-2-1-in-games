The Boston Bruins defeated the
Chicago Blackhawks 2-0 to lead the  National Hockey League ’s
Stanley Cup Final by two games to one.  Daniel Paille and  Patrice Bergeron  scored second-period
goals for the Bruins at TD Garden in Boston.  Game 4 in the best-of-seven series is scheduled for the
same venue on June 19.  The series pits the 2010 champion against the following
year’s Stanley Cup recipient. The Blackhawks ended a 49-year
wait for a fourth NHL title three years ago and the Bruins
snapped a 39-year gap between titles when they claimed a sixth
championship in 2011.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
