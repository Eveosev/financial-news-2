TransDigm Group Inc. (TDG)  surged to a
record as the maker of aircraft components said it is
considering a special dividend of as much as $1.8 billion.  Shares of TransDigm rose 3 percent to $156.85 at the close
in New York, the highest price since March 2006 when the company
first sold stock.  TransDigm is asking lenders to agree to a new financing
plan, including $700 million in new loans, according to a
statement today by the Cleveland-based manufacturer. The company
will use proceeds from the new debt arrangements to pay a cash
dividend of $1 billion to $1.8 billion.  It would be the third  special dividend  the company has paid
out after declaring one-time payouts in 2012 and 2009. TransDigm
had $3.6 billion in  total debt  at the end of the fiscal year
ending in September, the highest since at least 2004, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In the refinancing, the company also wants to change
certain ratios in its existing senior secured credit facility
and may seek to raise $700 million of new debt. TransDigm is
presenting its plan to lenders today and there is no assurance
that the refinancing or the special dividend will go ahead, it
said.  The company’s shares have gained 15 percent this year,
compared with a 16 percent advance for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
