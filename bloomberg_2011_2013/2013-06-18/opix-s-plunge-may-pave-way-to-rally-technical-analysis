Japan ’s biggest equity rally in a
quarter century may scale new heights after rebounding from a
three-week, $400 billion drop, according to Kenji Abe, chief
Japan equity strategist at Citigroup Global Markets.  The  Topix index’s  15 percent decline since reaching a near
five-year high on May 22 mirrors similar declines in 2003 and
2004, Abe said. The earlier drops in Japan’s broadest share
gauge also occured when the economy was showing signs of
recovery, with the index then trading within a range before
ascending to new highs, he said.  The recent rout left the gauge  trading  at 13.76 times
forecast earnings per share as of yesterday, down from 16.63
last month. The index traded at a multiple of 20 in October 2003
and 25 in May 2004. Even with the correction, the Topix rallied
50 percent through yesterday from Nov. 14 on optimism Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe’s push for record stimulus would spur
economic growth and end decades of deflation.  “Taking into account that the current environment
surrounding Japan’s markets is better in terms of valuations and
boldness of monetary policy, the period when markets trade in a
range will be much shorter,” Citigroup’s Abe said. “The
markets will gradually turn to rise around the second half of
July when earnings season starts.”  On Nov. 19, 2003, the Topix capped a 14 percent correction
and rallied 28 percent over the next five months, according to
Bloomberg data. On May 17, 2004, the measure completed a 13
percent correction and traded in a 149-point range for nearly a
year before breaking out and gaining 60 percent through April 7,
2006.  The Topix will rise to 1,300 at year-end and 1,320 by the
close of March 2014, Citigroup’s Abe projected, adding that
financials and auto manufacturers are attractive sectors. Nomura
Holdings Inc., Japan’s biggest brokerage, projected the gauge
will rise to 1,500 by the end of December. Earnings for Topix
companies will jump 53 percent this fiscal year to 78.85 yen a
share, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
