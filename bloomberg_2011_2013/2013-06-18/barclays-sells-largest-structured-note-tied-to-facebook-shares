Barclays Plc (BARC)  sold $25.2 million of
one-year notes tied to shares of  Facebook Inc. (FB) , the largest such
offering since the stock started trading publicly 13 months ago.  The securities, issued June 13, yield three times the gains
of the stock with a maximum of 32.75 percent, and all capital at
risk, Barclays said in a  prospectus  filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. Bank of America Corp. distributed the
notes for a 1.75 percent commission.  Facebook, the social networking company started by  Mark Zuckerberg  in his Harvard University dorm room, has fallen 9.1
percent this year to $24.21.  “Average user growth in developed markets such as North
America continues to decelerate,” Carlos Kirjner, an analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in New York said in a telephone
interview.  Sanford Bernstein   lowered  its 12-month target price for the
stock to $27 on Feb. 12 from $33.  The security is one of eight offerings since Aug. 28 linked
to the Menlo Park, California-based company, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Brandon Ashcraft, a spokesman for Barclays in New York,
declined to comment on the note.  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
