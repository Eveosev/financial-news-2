Palm oil  jumped to the highest level
in almost three months on speculation that exports from
 Indonesia  and Malaysia, the top producers, may increase ahead of
the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.  The contract for September delivery climbed as much as 0.7
percent to 2,480 ringgit ($786) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives, the highest price for the most-active
futures since March 25, and was at 2,476 ringgit at 12:15 p.m.
in Kuala Lumpur. Palm for local  physical  delivery in July was at
2,440 ringgit yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Shipments from Indonesia probably advanced for the first
time in four months in May to 1.57 million tons from April, the
median of estimates from three plantation executives, a refiner
and an analyst compiled by Bloomberg showed. That’s the first
gain since an 8.2 percent increase in January, the survey
showed. Exports from  Malaysia  jumped 18 percent to 709,860 tons
in the first 15 days of this month, surveyor Intertek said on
June 15.  Exports from Malaysia “should increase month-on-month in
June due to the expected stock-up ahead of Ramadan,” said Alan Lim Seong Chun, an analyst at Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd. “The
news about Indonesian exports gaining should be slightly
positive to the market because it shows that the demand for
Ramadan is really coming in. Also, northern hemisphere is still
in warm weather so palm oil is still usable.”  Demand typically picks up ahead of Ramadan, which falls in
July this year, when Muslims break day-long fasts with communal
meals. Palm oil clouds in cooler temperatures.  Soybean oil  for December delivery advanced 0.2 percent to
47.97 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, while
soybeans for delivery in November climbed 0.5 percent to $12.92
a bushel. Refined palm oil for January delivery gained 0.6
percent to 6,296  yuan  ($1,027) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange , while soybean oil for delivery in the same month rose
0.8 percent to 7,696 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
