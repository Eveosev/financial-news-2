Costa Rica’s government unexpectedly
revised its economic growth  data  for the first four months of
this year after it found that export figures were incorrectly
reported, central bank president Rodrigo Bolanos said.  Expansion in the period was revised to 2.1 percent from 3.4
percent, Bolanos told reporters today in  San Jose . Growth in
April, the most recent month reported, was cut to 1.9 percent
from 3.1 percent. Exports from free-trade zone businesses were
incorrectly entered into the central bank’s system last week,
which resulted in the inflated growth figures, he said.  “The problem was that the customs system introduced
duplicate information about exports from free-trade zones,”
Bolanos said. “Due to that, we overestimated the export figures
for the year.”  The $41 billion Central American economy will probably grow
less than the 4 percent originally forecast for this year,
Bolanos said. Inflation is still expected to stay within the
range of 5 percent, plus or minus one percentage point, for the
year.  The yield on Costa Rica’s dollar bonds due in 2023 rose 8
basis points to 4.92 percent at 11:55 a.m. local time. The
currency, the colon, gained 0.3 percent against the dollar to
498.61. The colon has rallied 1.9 percent versus the dollar this
year, the biggest gain among 16 Latin American and Caribbean
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Exporters from free trade zones in Costa Rica include  Santa
Clara , California-based  Intel Corp . and  Palo Alto , California-based  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)   To contact the reporter on this story:
