Playing sports can help boost
leadership skills for female executives, according to accounting
firm Ernst & Young.  A survey published today by the company said 55 percent of
women in senior management and executive roles in the U.S.
participated in sports at a university level, compared to 39
percent of other female managers. Almost three-quarters of the
women surveyed said women who have competed in sports work more
effectively in teams compared to those who haven’t.  The survey “underscores the fundamental role that
participation in sports plays in developing women leaders,”
Beth Brooke, global vice chairwoman, public policy at Ernst &
Young, said in an e-mailed statement.  “Not only do the majority of senior women executives have
sports in their background, they recognize that the behaviors
and techniques learned through sports are critical to motivating
teams and improving performance in a corporate environment,”
she said.  The survey got the views of more than 800 executives at
companies with annual revenue of more than $250 million. About
40 percent of those who responded in May were women, and 44
percent of those managers held board-level posts.  The Ernst & Young statement didn’t list comparable
statistics for men or say if such figures were known.  The research forms part of a wider effort by Ernst & Young,
introduced in March, to tap into the leadership potential of top
women athletes once they retire from competition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
