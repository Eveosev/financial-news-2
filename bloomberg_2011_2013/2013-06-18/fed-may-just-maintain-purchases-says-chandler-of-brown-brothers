Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke will probably say tomorrow after a central-bank meeting
that policy makers will maintain current bond purchases until
improvement in the economy changes their mind, said Marc Chandler of Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.  “Bernanke’s going to be clear, as clear as the Federal
Reserve chairman is, that they haven’t decided to do anything
except to continue the current policy until the data change
their mind,” Chandler, chief currency strategist at Brown
Brothers in New York, said during an interview on Bloomberg
Radio’s “Surveillance” with  Tom Keene  and  Michael McKee . “And
so far the data hasn’t changed their mind.”  The Fed, which opened a two-day policy meeting today, is
buying $85 billion of Treasuries each month to put downward
pressure on borrowing costs. It has kept its  target rate  for
overnight lending between banks at almost zero since 2008 to
support the economy.  Bernanke told U.S. lawmakers May 22 the Fed could begin
slowing bond purchases if it sees sustainable improvement in the
labor market. While U.S. employers added 175,000 jobs in May,
more than economists forecast, the  unemployment rate 
unexpectedly rose to 7.6 percent, the Labor Department reported
on June 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
