Jefferies Group LLC, the investment
bank owned by  Leucadia National Corp. (LUK) , said fiscal second-quarter profit fell 34 percent as trading revenue declined.  Net income for the three months ended May 31 slid to $42
million from $63.5 million a year earlier, the New York-based
firm said today in a statement. Jefferies was acquired this year
by New York-based Leucadia, whose quarter ends June 30.  Jefferies saw a “significant slowdown” in fixed-income
trading during March and April resulting from uncertainty about
the direction of the Federal Reserve’s bond-buying program,
Leucadia Chief Executive Officer Richard Handler, who oversees
Jefferies, said in the statement. Fed officials have indicated
that the central bank would slow its bond purchases if they saw
improvement in the economy.  Sluggish trading in the first two months of the quarter
“offset better fixed-income results in May,” Handler, 52,
said.  Volatility, a measure of swings in the prices of
securities, surged in May after dropping in March and April,
according to the  Bank of America Merrill Lynch MOVE index . The
gauge, which is based on prices of over-the-counter Treasury
options, jumped to 84.8 on June 6 from a low of 48.9 on May 9
after averaging 62.2 over the last 12 months.  Investment Banking  Revenue from sales and trading fell 13 percent to $358.8
million in the quarter from a year earlier, the firm said. That
was led by a 27 percent decline in revenue from trading fixed-income securities, which slid to $213.3 million. Revenue from
equities trading increased 22 percent to $145.5 million.  Investment-banking revenue declined 6.7 percent to $277.1
million from a year earlier, the firm said.  Jefferies said it restated its after-tax first-quarter
profit to exclude $8.5 million in professional expenses that
should have been counted in the second quarter. This had the
effect of boosting first-quarter net income by $5.3 million.  Leucadia fell 1.4 percent to close at $27.36 in New York.
The shares have  climbed  18 percent this year, compared with the
16 percent advance of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Jefferies was purchased by its biggest shareholder for $3.2
billion in a deal that the companies said would help the firm
weather market turmoil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
