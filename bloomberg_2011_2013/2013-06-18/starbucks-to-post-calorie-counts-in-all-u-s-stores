Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  is making it easier
for customers to count calories.  Beginning June 25, Starbucks stores will post  calorie
counts  on menu boards and pastry cases in all of its 11,100 U.S.
cafes, the Seattle-based company said today in a statement. The
posted information will be for standard drinks and won’t include
options such as soy milk and sugar-free syrups.  Starbucks joins other  restaurant chains , such as  McDonald’s
Corp. (MCD) , in trying to attract Americans with more transparency
around its food. The coffee seller has also been trying to make
its menu healthier ahead of a pending U.S. health-law mandate
that would require eateries with more than 20 locations to list
calories. In 2009, Starbucks cut high-fructose corn syrup from
its baked goods, and stores recently began selling salads with
fewer than 450 calories.  Starbucks rose 0.3 percent to $66.24 at 9:33 a.m. in  New
York . Through yesterday the  shares  had gained 23 percent this
year, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 15
percent.  Starbucks in 2007 set nutrition standards for its new
products to have fewer than 500 calories. At Starbucks, a 16-ounce  latte  has 190 calories, while a cheese danish packs 420
calories.  McDonald’s, the world’s largest restaurant chain, in
September began posting calorie counts on menu boards in the
U.S. after being criticized for selling unhealthy foods. The Big
Mac seller has also recently introduced lower-calorie options
such as a 250-calorie egg-white breakfast sandwich.  To contact the reporter on this story:
