Chrysler Group LLC’s decision to
repair as many as 2.7 million sport-utility vehicles linked to
51 deaths in post-crash fires averts what could have been the
biggest showdown with U.S. regulators in three decades over a
safety defect.  Chrysler, based in  Auburn Hills ,  Michigan , said in a
statement yesterday it reached an agreement with the U.S.
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for a “voluntary
campaign” to inspect and repair  Jeep Grand Cherokee  and Jeep
Liberty vehicles with fuel tanks mounted behind the rear axles.
The company, in a letter to NHTSA yesterday, said the vehicles
in question are safe.  “I’m sure they had some legal experts say that with the
preponderance of the evidence, it was going to be very hard to
tip the scales in their favor given the deference courts give
government regulatory agencies,” said  David Kelly , an acting
NHTSA administrator during the George W. Bush administration
who’s now a transportation safety consultant.  Chrysler on June 4 said it would refuse NHTSA’s request to
recall the vehicles because they didn’t pose a safety risk. Had
the company held that position by yesterday’s deadline to
respond to the regulator, the standoff could have proceeded to a
public hearing and possibly to court.  The company is majority owned by  Italy ’s  Fiat SpA (F) , which
 declined  as much as 9 cents, or 1.6 percent, to 5.56 euros and
was down 1.2 percent as of 4:07 p.m. in Milan trading. The
shares have climbed 47 percent this year, valuing the Turin,
Italy-based automaker at 6.98 billion euros.  Vehicle Reputation  Chrysler stuck by its defense of the vehicles’ safety,
saying in the statement yesterday they aren’t defective and are
among the safest in their peer group.  “Chrysler Group recognizes that this matter has raised
concerns for its customers and wants to take further steps, in
coordination with NHTSA, to provide additional measures to
supplement the safety of its vehicles,” the company said.  The negative publicity that would have persisted through
regulatory or court challenges may have pushed Chrysler Chief
Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne  to change his mind, said
Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst for auto-researcher Edmunds.com
in  Santa Monica ,  California .  “Chrysler can’t afford to have that vehicle’s reputation
damaged,” Krebs said in a telephone interview. “It’s the heart
and soul of Jeep and a source of big profit to Chrysler.”  Trailer Hitches  The repair involves installing or repairing trailer hitches
to enhance protection in a low-speed crash, Chrysler said.  For 1.56 million Liberty and older Grand Cherokee vehicles,
a hitch assembly will be installed if one isn’t there now, the
company said in an e-mailed statement. If a vehicle has an
aftermarket hitch not made by Chrysler, it may be replaced.  The fixes “incrementally improve the performance” of some
of the vehicles in low-speed crashes, Chrysler said in the
letter.  On about 1.14 million Grand Cherokees from model years 1999
through 2004, no action will be taken on those without a hitch.
Vehicles with after-market trailer hitches will be inspected,
and the units will be replaced if needed, Chrysler said.  NHTSA will continue its investigation “pending a review of
the documents provided by Chrysler in its recall action,” the
agency said in an e-mailed statement.  “Consumers impacted by the safety recall and customer
satisfaction campaign should have their vehicles serviced
promptly once they receive notification from Chrysler,” NHTSA
said.  Pinto Comparison  A recall of 2.7 million vehicles would be one of the 20
 biggest  in U.S. history,  Clarence Ditlow , executive director of
the Center for Auto Safety based in  Washington , has said. Ditlow
pushed Chrysler to recall the SUVs.  Ditlow, in a statement yesterday, said the repair isn’t
sufficient and he will keep pressuring Marchionne for a recall.  “In view of Chrysler’s refusal to recall 1999-04 Grand
Cherokees, we call on NHTSA to move to an initial determination
of a defect in order to force their recall as well,” he said.  Ditlow asked NHTSA to crash test the repaired Jeeps the
same way the agency did in 1978 with  Ford Motor Co. (F)  Pintos that
had a similar defect and were fixed by the automaker.  “If the modified Jeeps do not pass, we call on NHTSA to
require Chrysler to develop a more effective remedy just as
NHTSA did with the Pinto when it failed the first round of
tests,” Ditlow said.  Ditlow, in a 2011 letter to Marchionne, called the Grand
Cherokee a “modern-day Pinto for soccer moms.”  Two-Year Probe  NHTSA, in  letter  Chrysler disclosed June 4, proposed
recalls for Grand Cherokees in model years 1993 to 2004 and the
Liberty in model years 2002 to 2007. Chrysler said yesterday
those model years that will be covered in its effort.  NHTSA Administrator  David Strickland  last week said the
Chrysler vehicles in question have safety defects and it’s up to
owners to decide whether the SUVs are safe to drive.  The Transportation Department, which includes NHTSA, has
investigated the Chrysler SUVs for more than two years. A year
ago, NHTSA upgraded a defect investigation into the fuel systems
in as many as 5.1 million Jeep vehicles following reports of
about two dozen fires. NHTSA opened its probe into the Chrysler
vehicles in October 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
