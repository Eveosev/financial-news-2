Max Scherzer became the first
Detroit Tigers’ starting pitcher in 104 years to start a season
with a 10-0 record, allowing one run over six innings in a 5-1
victory over the Baltimore Orioles.  George Mullin had been the most recent Tigers’ starter to
win his first 10 decisions during the 1909 season, according to
the Elias Sports Bureau. The last  Major League Baseball  starting
pitcher to open a season with a 10-0 record was  Roger Clemens ,
who won his first 11 decisions in 1997.  Scherzer had 10 strikeouts and was backed by  Miguel Cabrera ’s 19th home run of the season, a two-run shot during the
bottom of the first inning in Detroit.  The New York Mets waited out a 3 hour, 52 minute rain delay
before losing to the Atlanta Braves 2-1 on a two-run, game-ending homer by Freddie Freeman in the bottom of the ninth
inning. Dillon Gee drove in a run with a single and pitched 8
1/3 scoreless innings before Freeman’s home run.  The Kansas City Royals won for the 11th time in 13 games,
beating the Cleveland Indians 2-1 as pinch-runner Elliot Johnson
scored on a wild pitch in the ninth inning.  To contact the reporter on this story:
