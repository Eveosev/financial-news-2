A lawyer for a son of deposed Libyan
dictator  Muammar Qaddafi  asked the  International Criminal Court 
for “an urgent ruling” on a Libyan government appeal to try
Saif al-Islam Qaddafi in Libya instead of the Hague.  Saif al-Islam’s attorney filed his request with the ICC’s
appeals chamber today, Fadi Al Abdallah, an ICC spokesman, said
by telephone. Libya asked the ICC June 7 to suspend its decision
to try Saif al-Islam in the Hague. Abdallah didn’t specify a
deadline for the ruling.  Libya has said it will offer guarantees for a fair trial.
The ICC wants to try Saif al-Islam for alleged crimes against
humanity committed during the 2011 uprising which led to the
capture of Qaddafi in October of the same year.  Libya’s General Prosecutor’s office said Saif al-Islam, who
is being held in Libya, will be tried along with several other
Qaddafi-era officials in August, the state-owned Libyan  News
Agency  reported yesterday.  They face alleged crimes of indiscriminate killing of
Libyans, inciting rape and drug dealing, LANA said.  The  Associated Press  reported earlier that Saif al-Islam’s
lawyer filed a request for appeals judges to reject Libya’s
request to allow a trial in Libya.  To contact the reporter on this story:
