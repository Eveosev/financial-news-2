U.S. tallow exports are forecast to
fall 3.7 percent this year as growing domestic use of the animal
grease to make biodiesel squeezes supply, keeping prices high,
Oil World said.  Tallow shipments from the U.S. may decline to 680,000
metric tons in 2013 from 706,000 tons last year, the Hamburg-based industry researcher wrote in an e-mailed report. They’ve
dropped from a record 1.32 million tons in 1998, Oil World said.  Tallow is a by-product of beef production, meaning supply
is not price sensitive, according to the report. Use of the fat
to make biodiesel jumped 60 percent in the past two years,
requiring demand rationing in chemistry and for edible purposes.  “Virtually stagnating world supplies and the increasing
consumption from the biodiesel industry have considerably
squeezed supplies available for other consumers,” Oil World
said. “We expect this trend to continue in 2014, keeping tallow
prices well supported.”  Tallow prices are expected to average $1,050 a ton this
year in Rotterdam, down from $1,085 in 2012, Oil World said.
They’ve more than doubled from $446 a ton in 1998, according to
the researcher.  World usage of tallow to make biodiesel rose to 1.6 million
tons last year from 1 million tons in 2010, according to Oil
World. With rising consumption by biodiesel makers, tallow
production has been insufficient and prices have been
“unusually high” since 2011, the researcher wrote.  Singapore has become an important consumer and is forecast
to lift tallow imports to 250,000 tons from 158,000 tons in
2012, from “virtually zero” five years ago, according to the
report. The fat is being used to make biodiesel for export to
the European Union, Oil World said.  Brazil  has turned into a net importer from net exporter on
rising domestic biodiesel needs, according to the researcher.  To contact the reporter on this story:
