The  New York Yankees  and Los Angeles
Dodgers are scheduled to play a doubleheader in New York today
after last night’s game was postponed because of rain.  Tickets for last night’s game at Yankee Stadium are valid
for the first game, which has a 1:05 p.m. New York time start.
The second game, which requires a separate admission, has a 7:05
p.m. first pitch.  The two-game series marks the first time the Dodgers, who
are managed by former Yankees All-Star  Don Mattingly , are
playing in the Bronx since the 1981 World Series.  That postseason matchup, won by the Dodgers, capped a five-year stretch in which the teams played three times for
baseball’s championship. They’ve met 11 times in the  World
Series , more than any other two teams, with the Yankees holding
an 8-3 lead.  The Dodgers played in New York City’s Brooklyn borough
before moving to Los Angeles for the 1958 season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
