Wheat advanced for the first time in
three days on concern that rains in parts of the U.S., the
world’s largest exporter, will further delay harvesting that’s
lagged behind last year’s pace.  The contract for delivery in September increased 0.8
percent to $6.93 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade by 10:03
a.m. in  Singapore  on volume that was 25 percent below the 100-day average for that time of day. Futures fell 0.9 percent in
the two sessions through yesterday.  About 11 percent of the winter-wheat crop was  collected  as
of June 16, behind last year’s pace of 51 percent and an average
of 25 percent in the previous five years, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said yesterday. Rains that came too late to improve
the outlook for maturing wheat in central and southern plains,
may delay the harvest, DTN said in a report yesterday. The
nation was hit last year by the worst drought since the 1930s.  “The current slower-than-normal harvest pace is providing
some near price support,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist
at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia , wrote in a report today.  Corn for December delivery rose as much as 0.5 percent to
$5.41 a bushel in Chicago, before trading at $5.4075. Soybeans
for November delivery gained 0.7 percent to $12.9475 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
