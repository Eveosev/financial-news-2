Foreign investors were net buyers of
 Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  shares for the first time in eight days
yesterday after the stock’s  valuation  fell to the lowest level
since at least August 2007.  Foreigners  bought  a net 2.5 billion won ($2.2 million)
worth of the company’s stock in  Seoul  trading, after selling
more than 2 trillion won of shares from June 5 through June 14,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Samsung traded for 6.1
times projected 12-month profit yesterday, compared with the
benchmark Kospi index’s 9.4 times.  Morgan Stanley was one of three global banks and brokerages
that cut its earnings forecasts for the company on June 10,
citing lower-than-expected sales of its flagship Galaxy S4
phone. The stock, which makes up about 19 percent of the  Kospi (KOSPI) ,
gained 0.6 percent to 1.37 million won today, paring this
month’s loss to 11 percent. The Kospi increased 0.6 percent.  “It’s not yet safe to say that foreigners have changed
their stance, but the massive selloff has eased somewhat,” Park Moon Seo, an analyst at KTB Investment & Securities, said by
phone from Seoul today.  Overseas funds were net sellers of $66 million of Korean
stocks yesterday, extending a seven-day selloff to $3.3 billion
since June 5. Foreigners have sold $6.72 billion of the nation’s
shares this year, the most among 10 Asian markets tracked by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
