Chinese President  Xi Jinping  pledged
a “thorough cleanup” of the ruling Communist Party as part of
a yearlong campaign aimed at ridding its ranks of formalism,
bureaucracy and extravagance.  The campaign will focus on party agencies and officials at
or above the county level, who will be required to reflect on
their own behavior and correct any misconduct, the official
Xinhua News Agency reported, citing Xi’s remarks at a conference
yesterday.  The Communist Party can only be stable when it has “a
single mind” and shares the joys and woes of the people, Xinhua
cited Xi as saying at the meeting, also attended by the other
six members of the Politburo Standing Committee, China’s top
decision-making body. “Winning or losing public support is an
issue that concerns the CPC’s survival or extinction,” Xi was
quoted as saying.  Since becoming head of the Communist Party in November and
President in March, Xi has vowed to combat official corruption
and has spoken of a  China  Dream that promises what leaders call
the renewal of the Chinese nation. Achieving that requires
relying on the people and mobilizing their creativity and
enthusiasm, Xinhua cited Xi as saying at the meeting yesterday.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
