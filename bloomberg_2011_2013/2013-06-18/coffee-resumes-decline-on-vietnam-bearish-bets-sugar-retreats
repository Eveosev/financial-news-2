Robusta coffee, down 7.3 percent
this month, resumed declines as speculators bet on lower prices
and rains improve the outlook for the next crop in  Vietnam , the
world’s top producer of the variety. Sugar retreated.  Regular rains in the main growing region of Vietnam are
aiding fruit growth and boosting the crop’s quality. Cherries
are “a bit bigger than last year,” said Cao Van Tu, chairman
of Dak Lak-based Ea Pok Coffee Co. The next crop will be better
than the last one, according to Mai Ky Van, deputy director at
October Coffee-Cocoa One Member Ltd. Money managers boosted bets
on falling prices of robusta by 35 percent to a  17-month high  in
the week ended June 11, according to NYSE Liffe.  Robusta coffee climbed more than 4 percent in January and
February on speculation dry weather in Vietnam would cut output
for the season that starts in October. Vietnamese coffee fell to
36,600 dong ($1.74) a kilogram (2.2 pounds) on June 14, the
lowest since Feb. 3, 2012,  data  from the Daklak Trade and
Tourism Center showed. Prices rose to 37,000 dong today.  “Drought conditions in the central highlands of Vietnam
are no longer a factor,” Sterling Smith, a futures specialist
at Citigroup Inc. in  Chicago , said in a report e-mailed
yesterday. “Our outlook for robusta is neutral to mildly
bearish. Barring a weather disruption we expect prices to range
from $1,700 a metric ton to $1,900 a ton.”  Robusta coffee for September delivery fell 0.6 percent to
$1,753 a ton by 11:41 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in  London . The price
was unchanged yesterday and gained 1.9 percent on June 14.
Arabica coffee for September delivery was little changed at
$1.233 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  Arabica coffee prices fell 3 percent this month as dry
weather helped accelerate the harvest in  Brazil , the world’s
leading producer. Growers will gather a record crop for a year
in which trees enter the lower-yielding half of a two-year
cycle, the government estimates.  White, or refined, sugar for August delivery fell 0.7
percent to $488.50 a ton in London. Raw sugar for October was
1.4 percent lower at 17.01 cents a pound in New York.  Cocoa for delivery in September gained 0.2 percent to 1,462
pounds ($2,286) a ton on NYSE Liffe. Cocoa for September
delivery was up 0.1 percent at $2,216 a ton on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
