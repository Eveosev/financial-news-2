Corn in  South Africa  gained the most
in almost two weeks after the rand declined for a third day,
making imports of the grain more expensive.  Yellow corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
jumped 3.1 percent to 2,296 rand ($228) a metric ton, the most
for the contract since June 5, by the midday close in
Johannesburg. The price of the white variety gained 2.8 percent
to 2,325 rand a ton, also the most since June 5.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest economy declined for a
third day before data that may tomorrow show that the nation’s
current-account shortfall widened.  “The weaker rand caused today’s rise in prices,” Thys Grobbelaar, an analyst at Klerksdorp, South Africa-based Senwes
Ltd., said by phone today.  South Africa is the continent’s largest producer of the
grain and meal made from the white variety is a staple food
while yellow corn is mainly used as  animal feed .  Wheat for delivery in July increased 1.6 percent to close
at 3,575 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
