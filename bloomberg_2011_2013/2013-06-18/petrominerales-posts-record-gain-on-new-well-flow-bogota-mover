Petrominerales Ltd. (PMG)  rallied the most
on record after the Canadian driller said output jumped by at
least 8.8 percent from first-quarter levels as a new well in
 Colombia  added to production.  Petrominerales rose 12 percent to 12,500 pesos at 12:29
p.m. in Bogota after early increasing as much as 16 percent, the
biggest intraday gain since the shares started trading in August
2011. The stock was the biggest winner today on the Colombian
 Colcap index , which rose 0.9 percent.  The Curito-1 exploration well in central Colombia produced
an average 5,973 barrels of oil per day initially with an
electric pump, the company said in a statement yesterday. Under
natural conditions without the pump, the well has been flowing
at a stabilized rate of more than 2,700 barrels a day. The
company said its total output is now more than 24,000 barrels a
day, up from an average of 22,063 barrels a day in the three
months through March.  Rising output “should modestly ease” concern about
funding challenges, Jared Dziuba, an analyst at BMO Capital
Markets, wrote in a research report today.  Petrominerales, which is selling assets after its cash
balance tumbled by 89 percent over the past year, has received
interest from prospective buyers in stakes in Colombian oil
pipelines, Chief Executive Officer Corey Ruttan said in a
telephone interview yesterday. Holders of convertible bonds are
expected to exercise an option to demand repayment of about $200
million in August, he said.  Petrominerales, which reported a 35 percent drop in first-quarter output from a year earlier, is seeking to “maintain and
modestly grow production this year,” Ruttan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
