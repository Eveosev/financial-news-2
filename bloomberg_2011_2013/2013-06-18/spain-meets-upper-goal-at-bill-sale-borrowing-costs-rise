Spain met its upper goal at a bill
sale even as its borrowing costs rose ahead of the start of the
U.S. Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting to review monetary
policy.  The Madrid-based Treasury sold 5.04 billion euros ($6.74
billion) of bills, compared with an upper target of 5 billion
euros. It sold six-month bills at an average 0.821 percent
today, up from 0.492 percent on May 14. It sold 12-month debt at
1.395 percent, compared with 0.994 percent last month.  Investors are waiting to see whether the Fed’s Open Market
Committee will begin to pare stimulus measures and decide to
slow the pace of its monthly bond purchases as early as
September. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke is scheduled to speak
after the central bank’s decision tomorrow.  “It’s a reasonable set of results with adequate demand,”
said Richard McGuire, a senior fixed-income strategist at
Rabobank International in  London . “Higher yields reflect a
rising yield environment driven predominantly by speculation
over reduction of central bank stimulus and specifically of Fed
stimulus.”  The yield on Spain’s  10-year benchmark bond  fell one basis
points to 4.569 percent at 11:29 a.m. in Madrid, compared with a
euro-era record of 7.75 percent on July 25, before European
Central Bank President Mario Draghi first pledged to support the
euro.  Demand for six-month debt was 3.82 times the amount sold,
down from 4.65 last month. The ratio rose to 2.10 from 2.03 on
the longer-dated securities, the Bank of Spain said.  The Treasury said on June 6 it had covered 60 percent of
its planned mid- and long-term gross funding needs for 2013 even
as the fourth-largest  economy  in the euro region is mired in its
second recession since 2008, fueling a surge in its public  debt
load . It is due to return to the markets this week to sell as
much as 4 billion euros of bonds maturing in 2018, 2021 and
2023.  To contact the reporters on this story:
