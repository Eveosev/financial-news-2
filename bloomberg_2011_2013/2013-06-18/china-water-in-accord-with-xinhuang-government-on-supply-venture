China Water Affairs Group Ltd. (855) , a
municipal water and sewage-treatment provider, and the
government of Xinhuang county in central Chinaâ€™s Hunan province
formed a venture to try to address water-supply needs.  Xinhuang will contribute its existing water production and
supply business to the venture and a 30-year concession while
Beijing-based China Water said it will provide cash. Registered
capital will total about 30 million  yuan  ($4.9 million),
according to the statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange.
China Water will hold a majority stake, it said.  The pact follows one in July in which a China Water unit
agreed to establish a venture for water-related investments and
construction in Henan and neighboring Chinese provinces.  To contact the reporter on this story:
