North America  reclaimed the top spot
with the most millionaires last year, beating  Asia  as the
world’s ultra-rich pushed global wealth to a record high,
according to a report by Cap Gemini SA and  Royal Bank of Canada .  People in North America with at least $1 million in
investable assets climbed 11.5 percent to 3.73 million in 2012,
according to the 17th annual  World Wealth Report . High-net-worth
individuals in the Asia-Pacific region, which overtook North
America a year earlier, increased 9.4 percent to 3.68 million,
boosted by Singapore and  Hong Kong .  The combined wealth of the world’s millionaires rose 10
percent to a record $46.2 trillion last year, after declining
1.7 percent in 2011. North America remained the richest region
with $12.7 trillion of high-net-worth assets, compared with $12
trillion in Asia-Pacific where the wealthy are expected to
retake the top spot in “the very near future” and lead growth
over the next three years, according to the study.  “Both the U.S. and  Canada  benefited from marginal GDP
growth as well as equity and real estate markets,” Jean
Lassignardie, chief sales and marketing officer for Paris-based
Capgemini Global Financial Services, said at a press conference
in  New York  yesterday when the report was released. Still, Asia-Pacific’s total wealth increased 12.2 percent, outpacing North
America’s 11.7 percent growth, he said.  The increase in wealth was led by the super-rich, those
with at least $30 million to invest, whose assets and numbers
rose by about 11 percent following declines in 2011, according
to the report.  Latin America  The MSCI World Index, which tracks global stocks in
developed and  emerging markets , climbed 13 percent in 2012 and
has advanced 11 percent this year. The MSCI AC Asia Pacific
Index jumped 14 percent last year and is up 2.8 percent in 2013.  All regions had strong gains in high-net-worth populations
and wealth except  Latin America , which faltered amid slow
economic growth and “challenged” equity markets, according to
the report. The population of millionaires worldwide rose 9.2
percent to 12 million, the report showed.  In  Europe , the high-net-worth population increased 7.5
percent to 3.41 million and their wealth climbed 8.2 percent to
$10.9 trillion, the study found.  In Asia, Hong Kong’s number of high-net-worth individuals
climbed 36 percent to 114,000 people worth a combined $560
billion, the report stated.  Singapore ’s jumped 10 percent to
101,000 with wealth of $489 billion.  Global wealth will grow at 6.5 percent annually over the
next three years, led by the 9.8 percent increase from the Asia-Pacific region, according to the report. Assets of the high-net-worth are projected to reach $55.8 trillion in 2015.  Wealthy Entrepreneurs  The dominant source of wealth for the world’s richest
people is from entrepreneurship rather than inheritance,
according to a separate report this week by London-based
 Barclays Plc. (BARC)  Wealth is being created twice as quickly in
developing regions such as Asia-Pacific and  Africa , where it
took rich people an average of 12 years and 16 years,
respectively, to accumulate their assets, the study found.  A Pew Research Center study in April found that while the
 U.S. economy  has recovered for households with net worth of
$500,000 or more, the recession continues for almost everyone
else. Wealthy U.S. households boosted their net worth by about
21 percent between 2009 and 2011 as the rest of America lost 4.9
percent of household wealth, the Pew study found.  “Asia’s wealth generation is less dependent on markets,”
Barend Janssens, head of RBC Wealth Management’s emerging
markets division, told reporters in Singapore today, citing the
region’s entrepreneurship. That compares with “the Western
world where they manage a lot of inherited money. That creates
the potential to grow very quickly.”  Cautious Rich  The world’s affluent remained cautious in 2012, with a
focus on preserving assets, according to the report from
 Capgemini (CAP)  and Royal Bank’s RBC Wealth Management unit, which
surveyed more than 4,400 high-net-worth individuals. A third
were primarily focused on preserving wealth, while 26 percent
sought to increase assets. Almost 30 percent of high-net-worth
wealth was held in cash and deposits, the report found.  Millionaires in the  Middle East  and Africa were the most
focused on wealth accumulation, with about 42 percent making
asset growth a priority compared with 33 percent seeking
preservation, the study found.  North America’s wealthy held most of their assets in
 equities , at 37 percent, while those in Latin America and Asia-Pacific, excluding  Japan , preferred property. Latin America’s
rich had 30 percent of their portfolios in real estate, compared
with 25 percent for Asia-Pacific. Millionaires in Europe favored
cash and real estate, allocating 27 percent to each.  Capgemini and RBC Wealth Management compiled data from 71
countries accounting for 98 percent of global gross national
income. Toronto-based RBC Wealth Management manages more than
C$369 billion ($361 billion) for customers globally.  To contact the reporters on this story:
