Google Inc. (GOOG)  was asked by global data
protection regulators to explain how it will protect the privacy
of people viewed by users of the company’s Web-enabled
eyeglasses.  Google’s Glass -- a wearable computer in use by a limited
number of testers, which can take pictures and videos and share
information via the Internet -- poses potential concerns that
need to be discussed with regulators, watchdogs from the 27-nation European Union, Switzerland,  Canada , Australia, New
Zealand and  Mexico  said in a  letter  to Google’s Chief Executive
Officer  Larry Page  today.  “We would strongly urge Google to engage in a real
dialogue with data protection authorities about Glass,” said
the regulators, in the letter published on the Dutch data
authority’s website. As a leader in such products, Google will
be the “first to confront the ethical issues” linked to their
functions, said the regulators.  Google, operator of the world’s largest search engine,
already faces probes after it changed its privacy system to
create a uniform set of policies for more than 60 products last
year. Six data protection regulators started “coordinated”
enforcement measures in April over the Mountain View,
California-based company’s failure to fix complaints about the
new system.  Al Verney, a Brussels-based spokesman for Google, didn’t
immediately return a call and e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
