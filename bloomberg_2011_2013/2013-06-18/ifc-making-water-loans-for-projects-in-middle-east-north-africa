International Finance Corp., the
World Bank’s Washington-based lending arm, is arranging as much
as $70 million in financing for water-efficiency and wastewater
projects in the Middle East and North Africa.  The IFC will provide $50 million in loans to Metito and
arrange a $20 million loan as well to the private Dubai-based
water company from the German development finance institution
DEG—Deutsche Investitions und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH,
according to a statement.  “Providing long-term finance to the private sector is
necessary to meet the demands of water-scarce regions and
countries,” the IFC said. The Middle East and North Africa have
“poor rates of wastewater recycling but with greater
urbanization and a growing population, re-using water is
becoming increasingly important, especially for industry.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
