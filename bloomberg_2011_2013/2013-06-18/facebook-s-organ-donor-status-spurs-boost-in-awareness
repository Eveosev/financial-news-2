Facebook ’s addition of a way for its
users to tell people their organ-donor status helped boost the
number of people who registered as donors 21-fold in one day.  Two weeks after the social networking website set up the
profile information on May 1, 2012, the rate of new organ donors
was still climbing twice as fast as before, according to a paper
published today in the  American Journal of Transplantation .  Organ donation has long been an interest of Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer at Menlo Park, California-based  Facebook Inc. (FB)  Demand for organs far outpaces the number of
donors, with more than 118,000 Americans waiting for a life-saving transplant, according to the U.S. Department of Health &
Human Services. Eighteen people die daily, on average, waiting
for an organ.  “There’s a real emotional reward for doing the right thing
and telling people about it, and that leads to the best kind of
peer pressure,” said  Andrew Cameron , a study author, and the
surgical director of the liver transplant program at Johns
Hopkins Medicine, in a telephone interview. “You hope it’s
contagious.”  The study compared the number of Facebook organ donor
profile updates from May 1, 2012 to May 28, 2012, with the organ
donor registration data for 43 states and the  District of
Columbia . Data was unavailable for  Alaska ,  Delaware , North
Dakota,  New Jersey ,  Pennsylvania , South Dakota and  West
Virginia .  Potential Donors  The first day the field was available, almost 60,000 users
updated their organ donor profile. On the first day of the
initiative, there were 13,000 new online organ donor
registrations, a 21-fold increase over the baseline registration
rate of 616 people a day. There were a total of almost 40,000
new organ donors registered over the course of the first 13
days, or almost 33,000 more people registering than usual. The
number of new updates per day decreased to 538 on May 13.  Doctors can save as many as eight lives with a single
person’s organ donation and more than that with tissue donation,
said Cameron. The  Institute of Medicine  estimated that 10,000 to
15,000 people who would make good donors are lost due to lack of
consent, according to a 2006 report.  “The question is, when do we see an impact of a campaign
like this?” Cameron said. “Probably not for many years, it
will take years and years for the cohort to live their lives and
pass away.”  This isn’t the first research on Facebook’s networking
effect. A single message sent to 60 million people on Facebook
may have encouraged about 340,000 extra votes in the 2010 U.S.
election, according to a paper published in September in Nature.
Facebook is also working with the suicide prevention group
SAVE.org to boost research into the mindset of people who harm
themselves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
