Deloitte LLP  agreed to pay $10
million to  New York  State regulators and halt consulting
services for state-regulated financial institutions for one
year.  Regulators found “misconduct, violations of law and lack
of autonomy” in Deloitte’s consulting work with Standard
Chartered Plc, the state’s Department of Financial Services said
in a statement today. Standard Chartered hired Deloitte in 2004
to review anti-money laundering controls at the bank, according
to the regulator.  “Today, we are taking an important step in helping ensure
that consultants are independent voices - rather than beholden
to the large institutions that pay their fees,” Benjamin M. Lawsky, New York’s superintendent of financial services, said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
