German stocks  were little changed as
a report showed U.S. housing starts rose less than forecast last
month and investors awaited signs from the Federal Reserve on
whether it will begin to pare stimulus measures immediately.  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  fell 1 percent after a report
showed it sold fewer cars in the European Union last month.

stock exchange said it will seek 70 million euros ($94 million)

recovery, we expect the Fed will stop flooding the market,
leaving financial markets running without crutches,” Societe

“The Fed is likely to begin cutting large-scale asset purchase
programs in September, and should be done with QE3 no later than
January 2014.”  The DAX has lost 3.5 percent from a record on May 22, as
Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the central bank could pare

U.S. economy improves sustainably. The Fed begins its two-day
policy meeting today, with Bernanke scheduled to speak after its
policy decision tomorrow.  U.S. Housing  Housing  starts  in the U.S. climbed 6.8 percent to a 914,000

Bloomberg survey had called for an increase to 38.1.  BMW lost 1 percent to 69.87 euros. The world’s biggest
luxury carmaker sold 6.6 percent fewer cars in Europe in May,
