Natural gas gained a second day in
New York on forecasts for hotter weather in late June that would
spur demand from  power plants .  Gas for July delivery rose as much as 0.8 percent to $3.907
per million British thermal units in electronic trading on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , and was at $3.890 per million Btu
at 1:33 p.m. Singapore time. The contract jumped 3.8 percent
yesterday, the most in seven weeks, to $3.875.  The U.S. Northeast and parts of the Midwest may have above-normal temperatures from June 22 through June 28, according to
Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland. The high in
New York on June 25 may be 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius), 8
more than usual, according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,
Pennsylvania.  The high in St. Louis on June 23 may be 92 degrees
Fahrenheit, 5 more than usual, AccuWeather said.  “The market is taking its cues from the weather,”  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
Stamford, Connecticut, said yesterday. “We’re seeing a little
heat, especially in the Midwest and Northeast.”  Gas prices at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana,
will average $3.92 per million Btu this year, up from the May
estimate of $3.80, the Energy Information Administration, the
Energy Department’s statistical arm, said in its June 11 Short-Term Energy Outlook. The average for the third quarter was
raised 7.4 percent to $4.05 from $3.77.  To contact the reporter on this story:
