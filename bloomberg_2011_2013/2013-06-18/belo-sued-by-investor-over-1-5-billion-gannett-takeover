Belo Corp., the TV station operator,
was sued by an investor seeking to block a $1.5 billion takeover
by USA Today publisher  Gannett Co. (GCI)  because the $13.75-a-share
bid is too low.  The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local
363 pension fund sued Dallas-based Belo in Delaware Chancery
Court, saying company directors are obligated to get the best
price and agreed to an inadequate offer, according to filings
made public today in Wilmington.  “The process by which Belo was sold to Gannett was not an
auction process,” the fund said in the complaint. “Gannett CEO
Gracia Martore acknowledged that the deal came about as a result
of exclusive talks.”  The fund asks a judge to stop the deal under its present
terms and to award unspecified legal fees and expenses.  Meghan Gavigan, a Belo spokeswoman with Sard Verbinnen &
Co., said Belo had no comment on the lawsuit.  Belo operates 20 TV stations, reaching more than 14 percent
of households in 15 major markets, the companies said in a June
13 joint statement. Gannett, based in McLean,  Virginia , owns 82
newspapers and 23 TV stations.  The case is IBEW Local 363 Pension Trust Fund v.  Belo
Corp. (BLC) , CA8649, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
