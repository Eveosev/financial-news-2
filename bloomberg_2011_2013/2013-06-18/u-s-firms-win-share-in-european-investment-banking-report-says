JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. and BNP Paribas SA have been gaining market share in
European  investment-banking  fees as most Swiss and European
securities firms retreat,  Freeman & Co.  reported.  The European banks including the Swiss are “recognizing”
they don’t need to be “in every product or geography,” and are
relying on steadier fee earners such as their wealth-management
businesses, the New York-based research firm said today in an e-mailed report. Other companies including  Credit Agricole SA (CA) ,
Credit Lyonnais SA and Commerzbank AG have exited or closed
parts of their investment-banking businesses, reducing market
share, according to the Freeman report.  “The result is that European firms share of total
investment-banking fees are down 20 percent post-crisis,”
Freeman said. “Firms in  Canada , Asia, Australia and  South
America  have benefited as European firms shrink.”  Most European securities firms have struggled as the
sovereign debt crisis hurt revenue, and regulators force them to
hold more capital and limit compensation.  UBS AG (UBSN) , Switzerland’s
largest bank, announced plans last year to eliminate 10,000 jobs
and exit most debt-trading businesses to concentrate on money
management and boost profitability.  To contact the reporter on this story:
