Rubber declined on speculation that
supply from  Southeast Asia  will grow after top producers failed
to agree on export restrictions in a meeting last week.  The contract for delivery in November fell as much as 1.6
percent to 235 yen a kilogram ($2,479 a metric ton) on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange, snapping a two-day rally. Futures traded at
237 yen at 10:24 a.m., extending losses this year to 22 percent.  A global surplus will expand 57 percent to 490,000 tons
this year, enough to meet U.S. demand for six months, according
to RCMA Commodities Asia Group, the Singapore-based trading
company.  Thailand , Indonesia and  Malaysia , representing about 70
percent of world supply, failed to agree on new curbs after
reducing exports by 300,000 tons in the six months through March.  “A lack of agreement from the meeting of the three
producing countries is disappointing,” Hideshi Matsunaga, an
analyst at broker ACE Koeki Co. in  Tokyo , said by phone today.
“Thailand’s unilateral steps aren’t enough to bolster prices.”  Futures will drop to 225 yen by the end of December,
according to the median of 16 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Five anticipate 200 yen, a price last seen in 2009.  Thailand, the world’s largest producer and exporter, plans
to set up a fund to trade on the Agricultural Futures Exchange
of Thailand, or AFET. An initial 210 million baht ($6.8 million)
is expected to buy about 42,000 tons of rubber, Deputy Farm
Minister Yuttapong Charasathien said June 14.  Thai rubber free-on-board rose 0.3 percent to 86 baht a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of Thailand. Rubber for delivery in September on the Shanghai
Futures Exchange lost 0.4 percent to 18,045  yuan  ($2,944) a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
