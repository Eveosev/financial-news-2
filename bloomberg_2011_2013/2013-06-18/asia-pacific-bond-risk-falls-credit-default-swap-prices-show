The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds against non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
fell, according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  decreased 1 basis point to 131 basis
points as of 8:45 a.m. in Singapore, Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The benchmark is headed for its third
consecutive daily drop, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index declined 4 basis points
to 121 as of 10:18 a.m. in Sydney, according to National
Australia Bank Ltd. prices. The measure is also set for its
third straight fall, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index declined 2 basis points to
106 basis points as of 9:18 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to
Citigroup Inc. prices. The gauge advanced 2.5 basis points
yesterday, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
