The  yuan  fell the most in almost two
weeks as the People’s Bank of China halted five days of
strengthening the currency’s fixing amid speculation the  Federal
Reserve  will taper its bond-buying program.  The central bank set the yuan’s  reference rate  0.09 percent
weaker at 6.1651 per dollar, lowering it by the most since May
13. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asian Dollar Index dropped for a
second day before the Fed starts a two-day meeting. Currency
strategists from Barclays Plc to Deutsche Bank AG are advising
investors to sell the yuan, the best-performing emerging-market
currency in the past six months, as growth slows in the world’s
second-largest economy and inflows wane.  “We should not expect the fixing to go stronger and
stronger,” said Suan Teck Kin, an economist at  United Overseas
Bank Ltd. (UOB)  in  Singapore . “You don’t want to send a message of
one-way appreciation for the currency. The rest of  Asia  is also
down because of uncertainty over the Fed policy direction.”  The yuan fell 0.06 percent to 6.1285 per dollar in  Shanghai ,
the biggest decline since June 6, according to China Foreign
Exchange Trade System prices. It has rallied 1.7 percent this
year and touched 6.1210 on June 3 and May 27, the strongest
level since the government unified official and market exchange
rates at the end of 1993.  The onshore spot rate is allowed to diverge from the fixing
by a maximum 1 percent. The yuan has on average been 0.4 percent
weaker than the upper limit of its permitted trading range in
June, after hovering within 0.1 percent of the ceiling on most
days in the previous three months.  Foreign Inflows  Foreign direct investment in  China  rose in May by the least
in four months, official data showed today. Inbound non-financial investment increased 0.3 percent from a year earlier
to $9.26 billion, after a 0.4 percent gain in April.  Yuan positions at local financial institutions accumulated
from sales of foreign exchange, an indication of capital flows
into China, rose 66.86 billion yuan ($10.9 billion) in May, the
central bank reported June 14. That was the smallest gain since
November.  In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan fell 0.11 percent
to 6.1343 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards dropped 0.28 percent to
6.2745, trading 2.3 percent weaker than the onshore exchange
rate. The discount hasn’t been bigger since February 2009.  One-month implied volatility in the yuan, a measure of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
increased five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 1.76
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
