BC Partners  Ltd., a private-equity
firm, is close to an agreement to buy German academic publisher
Springer Science & Business Media GmbH from EQT Partners AB just
days after talks broke down over price, people with knowledge of
the negotiations said.  BC Partners, based in  London , may agree to pay 3.1 billion
euros ($4.2 billion) as well as another 200 million euros based
on performance targets, said two of the people, who asked not to
be identified as the deal is private. An agreement will probably
be announced as early as today, the people said.  EQT hoped to receive 3.5 billion euros for the company,
then lowered its asking price to 3.25 billion euros after BC
Partners emerged as the final bidder in the auction, people
familiar with the matter said previously.  BC Partners had refused to raise its offer above 3.1
billion euros, said the people, prompting EQT to make a
statement June 14 saying it intended to take Springer Science
public on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange this summer.  BC Partners’ lenders are set to meet tonight to approve the
new  capital structure  for the deal, one of the people said.  Representatives of BC Partners and Springer Science
declined to comment. A spokesman for EQT couldn’t be immediately
reached for comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
