Elders Ltd. (ELD) , an Australian
agricultural company, rejected a bid for its rural services unit
because it was too low and said it had begun exclusive talks to
sell its auto parts business. The stock plunged.  The offer for the Elders Rural Services was “inadequate
with respect to value, execution risk and other
considerations,” the Adelaide-based company said today in a
statement, without saying who made the bid.  Ruralco Holdings
Ltd. (RHL)  said on June 14 it had made an offer for the unit and that
there was no certainty a transaction would be completed.  Ruralco, which has a 12 percent stake in Elders according
to data compiled by Bloomberg, originally proposed a merger with
the rural services unit, Elders’s largest, last year. Elders has
been looking for buyers for the unit and its automotive
business.  The  stock  slumped 11 percent to 8 Australian cents in
Sydney trading at 11:19 a.m. local time. Elders has fallen 30
percent this year, compared with the 3.3 percent gain in the
benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index.  Elders has entered into a short period of exclusive talks
with one of three parties that made bids for its Futuris
Automotive unit, the company said. It expects the talks to lead
to a sale and proceeds from any deal will be used to repay debt,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
