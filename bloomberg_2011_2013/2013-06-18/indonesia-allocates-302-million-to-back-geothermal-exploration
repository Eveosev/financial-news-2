Indonesia  started a fund to finance
the exploration of geothermal energy resources as the nation
seeks to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels for electricity.  The finance ministry’s investment  agency  will manage 3
trillion rupiah ($302 million) this year for geothermal
exploration, Saritaon Siregar, the agency’s chairman, said in an
interview at a conference in Jakarta today. Local governments
that have geothermal areas can use the fund to determine their
potential, he said.  “If exploration shows good results, the local government
can put the area for bidding and investors that win can repay
the exploration funds to us,” Siregar said.  The energy source produces 1,341 megawatts, or less than 5
percent of Indonesia’s potential geothermal generating capacity
of 29,038 megawatts, according to data from the energy and
mineral resources  ministry .  Private investors can also apply for loans for geothermal
exploration, Siregar said. The agency hasn’t started
distributing funds, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
