Daimler AG (DAI)  and Warren Buffett-backed
 BYD Co. (1211) ’s venture, developing electric cars under the Denza
brand, said  Zhongsheng Group Holdings Ltd. (881)  is among dealers that
may offer the vehicle in China.  Shenzhen BYD Daimler New Technology Co.  plans to announce
its Denza dealers for Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen by the end
of July, said Hu Xiaoqing, manager at the venture’s marketing
department. Porda Havas International Finance Communications
Group, representing Zhongsheng for media queries, declined to
comment.  The Denza cars would add to the growing number of all-electric vehicles being introduced in China, the world’s biggest
auto market.  SAIC Motor Corp. (600104) , China’s biggest automaker, has
been offering the Roewe E50 electric car since November, and is
planning other zero-emission vehicles with its foreign partners.
