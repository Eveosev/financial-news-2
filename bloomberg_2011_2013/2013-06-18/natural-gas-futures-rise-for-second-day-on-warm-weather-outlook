Natural gas futures rose for a
second day in New York as forecasts called for above-normal
temperatures in the Northeast and Midwest that may boost demand
from  power plants .  Futures advanced 0.8 percent as hot weather will spread
across the northern U.S. from June 23 to June 27, according to
Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland . Prices pared
earlier gains after an update to the  National Weather Service ’s
Global Forecast system model predicted lower temperatures than
previous reports.  “The market continues to rebound from last week’s three-month low,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “Once we start to
put a little heat in the forecast, especially in the key
consuming regions of the Midwest and Northeast, the market seems
to catch a bid.”  Natural gas for July delivery gained 3 cents to settle at
$3.905 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Volume was 2.8 percent below the 100-day
average at 2:31 p.m. Prices have risen 17 percent this year.  Gas dipped on June 11 to $3.724, the lowest settlement
since March 13, on expectations for above-average  stockpile 
increases. The Energy Information Administration reported June
13 that inventories expanded by 95 billion cubic feet to 2.347
trillion in the week ended June 7, compared with the five-year
average injection for the week of 84 billion.  The midday forecast update called for temperatures to be at
or slightly above normal compared with earlier calls for hotter
weather, said  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group
LLC in Bethesda, Maryland.  Milder Weather  “The midday American model came in cooler for next week
and the week after for the Midwest and the East Coast,” Rogers
said today. “It did take a big chunk of demand out of the
picture that was there before.”  Temperatures in  Chicago  may reach 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25
Celsius) on June 27, 6 lower than average, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  Washington  will
rise as high as 86 degrees on June 29, 2 below normal.  A boom in  production , driven by new technology such as
horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has
pushed U.S. gas output to an all-time high. Marketed gas
production will rise to 70.01 billion cubic feet a day in 2013
from 69.18 billion last year, the EIA said in its June 11  Short-Term Energy Outlook.   The gains helped the U.S. meet 88 percent of its energy
needs in February, the highest monthly level since April 1986,
EIA data show.  Shale Gas  Output from shale plays such as the Marcellus in the
Northeast have pushed supplies to records in each of the past
four years. Natural gas in storage reached an all-time high of
3.929 trillion cubic feet in November. Inventories will reach
3.813 trillion at the end of October, the EIA said.  “It appears that in the next week, you’re going to start
to see the peak cooling season getting under way,” said Teri Viswanath, director of commodities strategy for BNP Paribas SA
in  New York . “We’ll start to see the industry curbing inventory
injections. For the next two months, we’ll likely see gas
supported above $4.”  July $4 calls were the most-active options in electronic
trading, rising 0.6 cent to 3.1 cents on volume of 774 as of
2:50 p.m. August $3.50 puts were the next-most active, declining
0.6 cent to 2.2 cents cent on volume of 503. Calls accounted for
54 percent of options volume.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
August was 29.82 percent at 2:45 p.m., compared with 30.03
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
