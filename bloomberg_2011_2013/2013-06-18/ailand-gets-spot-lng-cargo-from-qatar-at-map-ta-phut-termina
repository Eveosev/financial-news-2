PTT Pcl (PTT) ,  Thailand ’s importer of
liquefied natural gas, has received a spot cargo from Qatar at
its Map Ta Phut terminal, according to a company official.  The Onaiza, with a capacity of about 206,000 cubic meters,
arrived yesterday at the Gulf of Thailand terminal, said the
official who asked not to be identified because he isn’t
authorized to speak to the media. The tanker loaded its cargo at
Qatar’s Ras Laffan LNG terminal and departed on June 5,
according to ship transmissions captured by IHS Fairplay on
Bloomberg.  PTT owns and operates the Map Ta Phut terminal in Rayong,
which has a capacity of 5 million metric tons a year. The
company,  Southeast Asia ’s first LNG importer, signed its first
long-term contract with Qatargas in December 2012 for 2 million
tons annually for 20 years starting in 2015, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  PTT needs to buy as much as 2 million tons of spot LNG this
year to meet power-industry demand, the official said on April
12. The company last month purchased a mid-July cargo and one
for end-July through its fourth tender this year, according to
the official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
