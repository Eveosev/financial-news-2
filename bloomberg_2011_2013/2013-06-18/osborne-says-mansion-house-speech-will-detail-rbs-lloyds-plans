Chancellor of the Exchequer  George
Osborne  said he will use his Mansion House speech tomorrow to
set out plans for the return of  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) 
and Lloyds Banking Group Plc to the private sector.  An “important provision” is that taxpayers that rescued
the banks in 2008 get their money back, Osborne said in an
interview with BBC Radio 4.  “Absolutely at the heart of this is my determination that
we have a banking system that works for the British economy
rather than an economy that supports the banking system, which
is what we inherited,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
