Turkey ’s central bank kept its three
main interest rates unchanged for the first time since August,
citing a “healthy” recovery in domestic demand while exports
remain hobbled by a global slowdown.  The bank in Ankara kept its benchmark one-week  repo rate  at
4.5 percent, according to an e-mailed statement. It also kept
the overnight lending and borrowing rates, which mark the
boundaries of its so-called interest-rate corridor, at 6.5
percent and 3.5 percent respectively. The decision matched the
expectations of all economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The central bank has been cutting rates this year to spur a
slowing economy and prevent capital inflows from strengthening
the lira. The bank made no reference in its statement today to
the protests that have engulfed Istanbul and other cities in the
past three weeks, leading business and tourism groups to warn of
risks to the economy.  Capital inflows have weakened due to “uncertainty over
 interest rates  at the global level,” and the bank will maintain
“flexibility in its monetary policy in both directions” as
required by international conditions, it said today. Credit
growth in Turkey “remains above the reference level,” the bank
said.  The lira and bonds pared losses after the central bank’s
decision. The currency was down 0.2 percent at 1.878 per dollar
as of 2:25 p.m. Yields on benchmark two-year debt were up 45
basis points to 6.69 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
