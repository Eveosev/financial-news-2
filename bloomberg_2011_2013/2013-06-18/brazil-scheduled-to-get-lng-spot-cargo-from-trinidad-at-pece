Petroleo Brasileiro SA,  Brazil ’s
importer of liquefied natural gas, is scheduled to receive a
spot cargo from  Trinidad & Tobago , ship-tracking data show.  The Madrid Spirit, with a capacity of about 135,000 cubic
meters, is headed to the port of Pecem in northeastern Brazil,
according to transmissions captured by IHS Fairplay on
Bloomberg. Rio de Janeiro-based Petroleo Brasileiro, or
Petrobras, has a floating regasification terminal at Pecem.  The vessel was originally scheduled to dock yesterday,
according to the data. It sailed from Atlantic LNG Co.’s Point
Fortin terminal, where it loaded the supercooled natural gas and
departed on June 12.  Brazil doesn’t have long-term LNG supply contracts with
Trinidad & Tobago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Petrobras will import as many as 60 cargoes this year, up from
56 in 2012, Hugo Repsold, an executive manager, said June 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
