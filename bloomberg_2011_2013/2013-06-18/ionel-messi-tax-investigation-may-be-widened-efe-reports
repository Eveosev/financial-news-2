Spain may expand an investigation
into whether Barcelona soccer player  Lionel Messi  evaded income
tax on advertising deals,  Efe news agency  reported.  Public prosecutor Raquel Amado said in a complaint filed at
a Barcelona district court on June 12 that the four-time world
player of the year evaded 4.2 million euros ($5.6 million) in
tax between 2007 and 2009.  Spain’s tax authority may widen the investigation to
include the three years through 2012, Efe said, citing legal
sources it didn’t identify.  Messi, soccer’s top-earning player last year after  David
Beckham  according to France Football magazine, denies
wrongdoing. He said last week he has always fulfilled his tax
obligations.  To contact the reporters on this story:
