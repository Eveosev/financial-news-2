Kyuko-Lease Inc., a unit of  Orix
Corp. (8591) , is seeking to develop about 50 megawatts of solar
projects in Japan by March 2016 together with  Kyudenko Corp. (1959)  and
JFE Engineering Corp.  The three companies will start with a 1.7 megawatt solar
station in the southwestern prefecture of Kumamoto, they said in
a statement today. The plant is scheduled to start running in
September.  The partners will consider developing geothermal and wind
power projects, according to the statement. Orix has a 90
percent stake in Kyuko-Lease. The remainder is held by Kyudenko.  To contact the reporter on this story:
