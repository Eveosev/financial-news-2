International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) , the largest computer-services provider, said it will sell
software over the Internet direct to corporate executives, going
beyond the traditional model of doing business with chief
information officers.  IBM will market more than 100 cloud applications to heads
of marketing, supply chain, human resources and others, changing
the way it sells software as competition from Silicon Valley
startups mounts.  It’s the company’s second big move into cloud delivery this
month, following the purchase of SoftLayer Technologies Inc., a
cloud-computing storage provider that will help it compete with
Amazon.com Inc. Many of IBM’s customers are just starting to
become interested in software delivered via the Internet, known
as software-as-a-service or SaaS, said Marc Dietz, the director
of SmartCloud solutions for IBM.  “We’re serving a growing demand with a new way that we’re
going to market,” Dietz said. “It’s really an expansion and a
comprehensive cloud strategy for our clients.”  With SaaS, customers buy software as they use it and can
access it through the Internet, as opposed to signing multiyear
contracts for installation and support.  IBM, based in Armonk,  New York , is also adding new software
to the portfolio, including a social-media analytics product
that will allow businesses to monitor customer sentiment on
Facebook and Twitter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
