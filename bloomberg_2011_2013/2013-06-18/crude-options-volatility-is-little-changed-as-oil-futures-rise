Crude oil options volatility was
little changed as the underlying futures rose for the fourth
time in five days.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
August, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 18.78 percent on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  as of 1:20 p.m., compared with 18.86 percent
yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery rose 45
cents to $98.48 a barrel at 1:24 p.m. on the Nymex.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
December $120 calls, which gained 10 cents to 35 cents a barrel
on volume of 1,512 lots traded at 1:24 p.m. August $103 calls
were the second-most active, advancing 6 cents to 50 cents a
barrel on volume of 1,463 contracts.  Calls accounted for 59 percent of electronic trading
volume. In the prior session, bullish bets accounted for 54
percent of 130,035 contracts.  August $100 calls were the most-active options traded
yesterday, with 6,384 contracts changing hands. They fell 14
cents to $1.21 a barrel. December $100 calls increased 6 cents
to $3.62 a barrel on volume of 6,232 lots.  Open interest was highest for September $85 puts with
53,378 contracts. Next were December $105 calls with 36,624 lots
