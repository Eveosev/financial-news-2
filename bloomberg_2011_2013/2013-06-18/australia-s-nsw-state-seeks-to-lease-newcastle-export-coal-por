Australia ’s New South Wales state is
planning to offer a long-term lease for Newcastle port, the
world’s biggest export harbor for coal used in power stations,
as it seeks funds for infrastructure projects.  The proposed lease is subject to a scoping study, Mike Baird, NSW treasurer, said in e-mailed speech notes for the
state’s budget that was released today. The government in April
sold 99-year leases for Port Botany in southern Sydney and Port
Kembla in Wollongong for A$5.07 billion ($4.8 billion) to a
group including Industry Funds Management and a unit of Abu
Dhabi Investment Authority.  NSW, Australia’s most-populous state, is offering leases to
raise funds for infrastructure including road and rail projects,
Baird said.  Glencore Xstrata Plc (GLEN) , the world’s biggest exporter
of thermal coal,  Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU)  and Rio Tinto Group are
among companies that ship coal from Newcastle to countries such
as  Japan ,  South Korea  and China.  “The success of Port Botany and Port Kembla dictates that
we act now,” Baird said, announcing a budget deficit of A$374
million for the financial year ending June.  Port Botany is the nation’s second-biggest container port
after Melbourne and sits on Botany Bay. The Port Kembla terminal
is about 72 kilometers (45 miles) south of Sydney and is the
conduit for coal transported from mines in the south and west of
the state, according to its website. NSW is home to about a
third of Australia’s almost 23 million people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
