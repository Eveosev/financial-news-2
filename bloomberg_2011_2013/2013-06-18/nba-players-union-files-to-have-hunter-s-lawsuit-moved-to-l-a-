The National Basketball Players
Association filed a motion to transfer the lawsuit brought by
former union executive director Billy Hunter to Los Angeles,
saying the complaint was improperly filed last month.  Hunter sued the union, president Derek Fisher and his
publicist Jamie Wior, alleging they engaged in secret
negotiations with team owners to end the 2011 NBA lockout. The
complaint was filed in Alameda County,  California , where the
union said Hunter regularly worked, while Fisher and Wior live
in Los Angeles and the NBPA is headquartered in New York.  “The suit has no merit and my clients, Mr. Fisher and Ms.
Wior, plan to defend it vigorously,” attorney Andrew A. Kassof
said in an e-mailed statement. “First however, it must be moved
to the appropriate court as Mr. Hunter filed this action in
Alameda County which has no relation to this case.”  Hunter was fired as the union’s executive director in
February, ending a 16-year tenure. Player representatives from
24 of the 30 NBA teams in Houston for the All-Star weekend voted
unanimously to oust the former federal prosecutor.  The lawsuit is the latest in a battle between the union,
Fisher and Hunter, who was criticized in an independent review
of association business and hiring practices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
