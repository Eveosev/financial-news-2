Mexico ’s peso fell for a third day
as mounting concern that Federal Reserve policy makers will
signal this week that they’re preparing to scale back monetary
stimulus damps demand for emerging-market assets.  The peso fell 0.5 percent to 12.8958 per  U.S. dollar  at
10:27 a.m. in Mexico City. The currency’s one-month historical
volatility, a measure of the magnitude of fluctuations during
the period, surged to the highest since July 2012. Yields on
peso bonds due in 2024 rose nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, to 5.40 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Mexico’s currency has tumbled 5.9 percent since the
beginning of May as U.S. Treasury yields surged on speculation
the Fed may pare the stimulus program. The Fed starts a two-day
policy meeting today after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
last month that asset purchases could be scaled back if the
employment outlook showed sustainable improvement.  “The market is still thinking that the Fed will say
something about the tapering,”  Pedro Tuesta , senior economist
for  Latin America  at Washington-based 4Cast, said in a telephone
interview. “It’s basically everybody trying to cover their
short dollar positions.”  The Fed has been buying assets at an $85 billion monthly
pace, including $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities, to
bolster growth and reduce the jobless rate.  Housing starts in the U.S. climbed 6.8 percent, less than
analysts forecast, to a 914,000 annualized rate after a revised
856,000 pace in April, the Commerce Department said today in
 Washington . Applications to build one-family homes increased 1.3
percent to a 622,000 pace, the fastest since May 2008.  Mexico sends about 80 percent of its exports to the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
