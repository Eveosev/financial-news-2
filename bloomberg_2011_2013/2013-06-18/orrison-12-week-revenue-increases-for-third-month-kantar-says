William Morrison Supermarkets Plc (MRW) ’s
12-week sales advanced for a third straight month, signaling the
U.K. grocer’s push to get shoppers back into its stores with
revamped shops and fresh food is paying off.  Sales rose 1.2 percent in the 12 weeks to June 9, according
to researcher Kantar Worldpanel, the third consecutive increase
after six periods of decline. Morrison’s market share fell to
11.6 percent in the period from 11.8 percent a year earlier.  “Although Morrison’s’ share continues to decline, the loss
this period is the lowest for 2013 and indicates a small
underlying improvement for the grocer,” Kantar said in a
statement.  Morrison last month entered into a 170 million-pound ($265
million) deal with online supermarket  Ocado Group Plc (OCDO)  for a
belated entry to the Web grocery market in the U.K. Still, the
U.K’s fourth largest grocer, along with its bigger rivals  Tesco
Plc (TSCO)  and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s Asda, is losing market share to
discounters Aldi and Lidl and upscale competitors Waitrose and J
Sainsbury Plc.  “Savvy shoppers are looking for a good deal, but Britain’s
largest supermarkets should not lose sight of the other
attributes consumers are looking for in their grocer -- quality
products, clear provenance and an enjoyable in-store
experience,” said Fraser McKevitt, a retail analyst at  Kantar
Worldpanel .  Sainsbury (SBRY)  was the only one of the four biggest U.K.
grocers to win market share on an annual basis, the Kantar data
showed, while discounters Aldi and Lidl had record market
shares. Spending at Sainsbury increased 3.5 percent in the 12-week period and market share rose to 16.7 percent from 16.6
percent a year earlier, Kantar said.  The U.K.’s largest supermarket Tesco Plc’s share fell to
30.5 percent from 31 percent, with sales up 1.3 percent.  Waitrose’s 12-week sales climbed 10.4 percent, while its
market share rose to 4.9 percent from 4.6 percent. Aldi’s
revenue jumped 30 percent and market share advanced to 3.6
percent from 2.8 percent.  Market share at  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) ’s Asda chain weakened
to 16.9 percent from 17.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
