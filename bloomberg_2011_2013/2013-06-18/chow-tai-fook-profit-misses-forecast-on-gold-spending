Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group Ltd. (1929) ,
the world’s largest listed jewelry chain, rose the most in two
months in Hong Kong trading after saying it sees signs of
improving demand.  Chow Tai Fook jumped 2.3 percent to HK$8.86, the biggest
gain since April 19. The city’s  Hang Seng Index  dropped 1.1
percent.  The jeweler sees “gradual signs” of recovery even as the
macro-economic environment remains uncertain, it said in a
statement after the market’s close yesterday. Chow Tai Fook
expects sales to climb in the “double digits” this fiscal
year, Chairman Henry Cheng said on a video conference, beating
the 1.5 percent growth in the 12 months ended March 31.  “We expect first quarter to be very strong given a spike
in sales following the drop in gold prices in April,” Aaron Fischer, a Hong Kong-based analyst at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets,
wrote in a research note today. The brokerage raised its rating
on the stock to buy from outperform, and has a 12-month price
estimate of HK$10.80.  Retail sales of gold across  China  tripled April 15-16 as
the metal fell, according to the China Gold Association. Chow
Tai Fook outlets had to be restocked over the period because of
increased demand, according to the company.  The jeweler’s nine factories produced about 1.2 million
pieces of pure gold products in April, double the monthly
average of 600,000, it said. About 57 percent of the company’s
revenue came from gold products in the year ended March 31,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Profit Decline  Net income fell 13 percent to HK$5.51 billion ($710
million) in the year ended March because of higher costs and
weaker  consumer spending , Chow Tai Fook said yesterday. That
missed the HK$5.57 billion average of 25 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales rose 1.5 percent to HK$57.4 billion, coming under
pressure from “declining confidence of domestic consumers,”
and slower economic growth, the company said.  China’s economy 
expanded 7.7 percent in the first quarter, easing from 8.1
percent growth a year earlier.  “It’s not unrealistic to expect our compound annual sales
growth to be more than 20 percent for the next three years,”
Cheng said on the video conference from Beijing. “We’ve seen
signs of a recovery and we’ll have a lower base year.”  Chow Tai Fook’s selling, distribution and administrative
 expenses  increased to HK$9.2 billion from about HK$8 billion a
year earlier as it opened more shops. The company said it
expects capital expenditure to increase 42 percent to HK$1.1
billion in the 12 months ending March 31.  The jeweler plans to add 200 outlets this year, Managing
Director Kent Wong said at a briefing in  Hong Kong  yesterday. It
aims to have 2,000 stores by the end of 2014, an increase from
1,731 outlets as of March 31.  Shares of the company, founded by Chow Chi Yuen in 1929 in
the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, have lost 28 percent
this year, compared with a 7.4 percent drop for the Hang Seng
Index. “Tai Fook” means “big blessing” in Chinese.  To contact the reporter on this story:
