Hormel Foods Corp. (HRL) , the maker of
Spam luncheon meat and Jennie-O Turkey Store products, fell the
most in more than six months after saying profit in its current
year will be less than previously forecast amid rising costs.  The shares dropped 3.6 percent to $39.19 at the close in
 New York . The stock has climbed 26 percent this year, compared
with a 16 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Hormel in January agreed to acquire the Skippy peanut-butter business from Unilever for about $700 million to expand
further into  China . The company is looking to that product to
complement its recent introduction of its pork-based Spam to the
Asian nation. Lower-than-expected results in its pork operations
contributed to the lower forecast, the company said in a
statement.  “Higher input costs and softer sales of our retail
products in our Refrigerated Foods segment are the primary
reason for the expected shortfall in our second-half results,”
Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey M. Ettinger said in the
statement.  Profit per share in the year ending in October will be
$1.88 to $1.96, down from a previous forecast of $1.93 to $2.03,
the Austin, Minnesota-based company said today in the statement.
The average of 10 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg was
$1.99.  To contact the reporter on this story:
