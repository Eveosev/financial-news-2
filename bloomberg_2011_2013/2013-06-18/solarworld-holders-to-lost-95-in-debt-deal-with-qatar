Shareholders of  Solarworld AG (SWV)  will
lose 95 percent of their holdings in  Germany ’s biggest maker of
solar panels in a capital restructuring aimed at bringing in new
investors to save the company.  Qatar Solar S.P.C. seeks to buy a stake of 29 percent in
the Bonn-based company by purchasing new shares after the
current share capital is reduced 150:1, Solarworld said today in
a statement outlining an agreement with its creditors.
Bondholders will receive the proceeds from the Qatari investment
and an additional share purchase by Chief Executive Officer
Frank Asbeck, it said.  “The agreement is now subject only to reservations of
corporate body consent on the part of two participating
financial institutions,” the company said. “The management
board assumes that this reservation will be resolved and that
the agreement will become effective shortly.”  Solarworld is among companies battling competition mainly
from  China  that cut solar panel prices about 20 percent last
year. That tipped more than a dozen German businesses including
 Solar Millennium AG (S2M)  and Q-Cells SE, once the largest solar-cell
maker, into bankruptcy.  Shares of Solarworld fell as much as 20 percent in
Frankfurt trading after closing up 18 percent yesterday.  Solarworld, which seeks to hold an extraordinary general
meeting on Aug. 7, said the restructuring is to close between
Nov. 2013 and Feb. 2014.  To contact the reporters on this story:
