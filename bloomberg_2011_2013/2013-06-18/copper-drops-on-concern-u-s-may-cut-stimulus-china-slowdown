Copper declined for a second day on
concern that the U.S. Federal Reserve may scale back stimulus
measures and that further signs of slowdown in  China , the
biggest user, will curb demand for the metal.  Copper for delivery in three months fell as much as 0.5
percent to $7,047.50 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange
and was at $7,068.25 at 10:48 a.m. in  Shanghai . Earlier it
gained as much as 0.7 percent. The contract for delivery in
September on Comex lost 0.4 percent to $3.1970 a pound.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  indicated on May 22 that
stimulus aimed at bolstering the world’s largest economy could
be scaled back if the employment outlook shows “sustainable
improvement.” The central bank currently buys $85 billion a
month of Treasury and mortgage debt.  “Copper is likely to be capped in a range in the short
term,” said Cao Yanghui, an analyst at Nanhua Futures Co.
“Investors seem to have lost the interest as there are more
negative factors than positive ones now.”  China’s new home prices rose in almost all cities in May,
led by major centers, as the government’s latest property
measures failed to deter buyers. New home prices in China gained
in 69 cities out of 70 cities tracked by the government in May
from a year ago, data showed today. That compared with 68 cities
a month earlier.  The October futures contract on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange declined 1.2 percent to 51,090  yuan  ($8,336) a ton.  On the LME, nickel and tin declined, while zinc gained.
Aluminum and lead were little changed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
