Governments worldwide will spend
$449.5 billion on information technology this year, a decline of
0.1 percent from 2012, according to a  Gartner Inc. (IT)   report  that
revises an earlier estimate of an increase.  The main priorities will be mobile technologies, IT
modernization and cloud computing, the Stamford, Connecticut
research company said today in a statement. The estimate
includes hardware, software, IT services and telecommunications.  The revision from its earlier outlook for a 0.2 percent
increase comes as “government agencies continue to struggle
against weak economic development,” Gartner said. The estimate
is based on a study from June through September last year in 13
countries, including China, Brazil, India, the U.S. and Germany.  “Cloud computing, in particular, continues to increase
compared with prior years, driven by economic conditions and a
shift from capital expenditure to operational expenditure, as
well as potentially more important factors such as faster
deployment and reduced risk,” Christine Arcaris, Gartner’s
research director, said in the statement.  Earlier this month,  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) ,
a longtime federal contractor, successfully protested a $600
million contract award for Amazon.com Inc. to provide cloud-computing services to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.
IBM’s protest is ”potentially preventing a new competitor, like
Amazon, in getting more government work,” said  Amit Daryanani ,
an RBC Capital Markets analyst in San Francisco.  To contact the reporter on this story:
