The pound weakened versus the dollar
before a report economists said will show consumer-price
inflation in the U.K. accelerated last month for the first time
since February.  Sterling declined from near its strongest level in more
than four months against the dollar. The annual  inflation rate 
climbed to 2.6 percent in May from 2.4 percent in April, the
 Office for National Statistics  in  London  will say today,
according to the median prediction of 36 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.  The pound fell 0.3 percent to $1.5674 at 7:22 a.m. London
time, after climbing to $1.5752 yesterday, the highest since
Feb. 11. Sterling was little changed at 85.07 pence per euro.  The pound has strengthened 4.1 percent in the past three
months, the best performer among 10 developed-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro rose
3.2 percent and the dollar fell 0.1 percent.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 1.6 percent this year
through yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.
German bonds dropped 0.7 percent and Treasuries declined 1.1
percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
