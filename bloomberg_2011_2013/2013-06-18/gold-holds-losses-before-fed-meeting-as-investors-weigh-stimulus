Gold futures fell to a three-week
low on speculation that the  Federal Reserve  may signal a
reduction of U.S. economic stimulus. Palladium dropped to the
cheapest in more than a month as European car sales plunged.  Fed policy makers began a two-day meeting today. The
central bank currently buys $85 billion a month of Treasuries
and mortgage debt. Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last month the
pace of purchases may be scaled back if the employment outlook
shows sustainable improvement. Physical gold demand in  North
America  and  Europe  has dropped 80 percent from April, Kitco
Metals Inc. said in a report.  “Everybody is waiting for tomorrow’s statement,”  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview. “There is a complete lack of interest on
the physical side.”  Gold futures for August delivery declined 1.2 percent to
settle at $1,366.90 an ounce at 1:44 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . The price touched $1,360.20, the lowest for a most-active
contract since May 23.  The cost of living in the U.S. rose less than forecast in
May, restrained by the first drop in food prices in almost four
years, a government report showed today.  Gold has fallen 18 percent this year, partly as investors
lost faith in the commodity as a store of value amid low
inflation. Global holdings in  exchange-traded products  backed by
the metal extended a slump to the lowest since March 2011.  Silver futures for July delivery slid 0.4 percent to
$21.677 an ounce on the Comex.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , palladium futures for
September delivery dropped 1.3 percent to $708.35 an ounce.
Earlier, the price touched $697.10, the lowest since May 10.  Platinum futures for July delivery rose 0.4 percent to
$1,440.10 an ounce. Both the metals are used in jewelry and
pollution-control devices in cars.  European auto sales fell to a 20-year low in May amid
rising joblessness caused by a recession in the euro region.  To contact the reporters on this story:
