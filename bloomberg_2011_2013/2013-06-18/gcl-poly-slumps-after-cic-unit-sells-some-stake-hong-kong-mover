GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. (3800) 
dropped the most in 20 months after a unit of China Investment
Corp. sold 1.2 billion shares in the largest maker of materials
used in solar panels.  GCL-Poly dropped as much as 13 percent to HK$1.82, the
sharpest fall since Oct. 4, 2011, and was at HK$1.86 as of the
noon trading break in Hong Kong. The city’s benchmark  Hang Seng
Index  declined 0.6 percent.  Chengdong Investment Corp., a subsidiary of CIC, sold 1.2
billion shares of GCL-Poly, representing 7.8 percent of the
polysilicon maker’s equity capital, at HK$1.87 each, according
to a GCL-Poly statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange today.
The announcement triggered a selloff among concerned investors,
according to Peter Sheng, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Guotai
Junan Securities HK Ltd.  “Fundamentals of GCL-Poly haven’t changed even as the
share sale from CIC injected a sense of bear sentiment into
investors’ minds,” said Sheng, who has a $HK2 target price for
GCL-Poly shares. “I see this round of selloff as a good buying
opportunity for those who’ve paid enough attention to the
company’s fundamentals.”  Chengdong continues to own 12.3 percent of GCL-Poly’s share
capital after the sale, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
