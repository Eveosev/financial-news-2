Five-time champion  Venus Williams 
said she will skip Wimbledon this year because of a back injury.  The 33-year-old American said on her Facebook page that she
planned to return to the courts for a World Team Tennis event in
Washington on July 8. Wimbledon is set for June 24-July 7 at the
All England Club in London.  “Unfortunately, I will not be able to participate in
Wimbledon this year,” Williams said. “I am extremely
disappointed as I have always loved the Championships, but I
need to take time to let my back heal.”  Williams, who has won a total of seven Grand Slam singles
titles, lost in the first round of the  French Open  last month.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
