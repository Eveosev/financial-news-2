Verny Capital, the Kazakh manager of
billionaire Bulat Utemuratov’s money, plans to spend $300
million to build a commercial and hotel complex in Astana, the
country’s capital.  The Talan Towers project will include a 30-floor, 145-meter
(475-foot) office building and a 26-story residential complex
with a Ritz-Carlton hotel, Verny said in a statement distributed
today to reporters in Astana, where’s it’s based.  The central Asian nation, which holds about 3 percent of
the world’s oil and is the largest uranium supplier, moved its
capital to Astana from Almaty in 1998. Verny manages about $4
billion of assets in industries from energy to
telecommunications in countries including Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, Russia and  Austria , according to the company’s
website.  Verny already owns hotels under the Ritz-Carlton brand, in
Moscow and Vienna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
