Charter Hall Group (CHC) , which owns and
manages Australian commercial properties, said its unlisted
office fund and two partners will buy an office building and
mall in Perth for A$458 million ($434 million).  Charter Hall’s Core Plus Office Fund has partnered with a
domestic pension fund and a global institutional partner to
purchase the property from the receivers of Westgem Investments
Pty, the Sydney-based company said in a regulatory filing,
without identifying the partners. The acquisition in Perth’s
center includes an office building leased to the Bank of Western
Australia Ltd. and the Raine Square shopping center, anchored by
a lease to  Wesfarmers Ltd (WES) .-owned Coles supermarket, it said. The
property has a combined lettable space of 61,564 square meters
(662,669 square feet).  “The acquisition is in line with our strategy of raising
and deploying capital into core real estate investments,” David
Harrison, joint-managing director of Charter Hall, said in the
statement. “Despite the slowdown in the resource sector, we are
confident about the longer-term outlook for Perth and are
attracted to the security of a non-resource tenant of Bankwest’s
caliber.”  Charter Hall, which didn’t invest in the properties, will
manage them, it said. The acquisition won’t affect the company’s
earnings this financial year, which ends June 30, and will add
to income in fiscal year 2014, it said.  Charter Hall  shares  have risen 12 percent this year,
compared with a 3.6 percent gain in the benchmark S&P/ASX 200
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
