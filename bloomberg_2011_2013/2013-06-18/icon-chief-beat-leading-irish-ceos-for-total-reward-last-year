Icon Plc (ICLR)  Chief Executive Officer
Ciaran Murray earned the equivalent of $9.46 million in 2012, a
higher remuneration higher than that of CEOs at the 15 biggest
listed Irish companies on the benchmark  ISEQ Overall Index. (ISEQ)   Murray, who became CEO of clinical research business Icon
in October 2011 after serving as chief financial officer, was
awarded a bonus of $5.45 million in 2012, according to documents
posted online yesterday ahead of the annual meeting. Murray’s
total compensation in 2011 was $1.78 million.  “As the company is, to a large extent a people business,
the board recognized the importance of financially rewarding key
members of the executive management team for delivering such a
successful 2012,” Chairman Thomas Lynch said in a letter to
shareholders dated June 14.  Icon, which carries out clinical trials for companies such
as Pfizer Inc., ended its Irish Stock Exchange listing and moved
its primary listing to the U.S. Nasdaq at the start of the year.
The stock  rose  62 percent in 2012 and climbed 29 percent to
$35.94 this year as of yesterday, giving the company a market
value of $2.2 billion. Net income more than doubled to $55.4
million last year.  Part of Murray’s bonus has already been paid and he will
receive $1.94 million in March 2014 and the same figure again
the following year, according to the company documents. The
unpaid bonus is payable in cash or shares, at the discretion of
the Dublin-based company’s compensation committee.  Incentive Plan  Murray’s salary at Icon was 606,000 euros ($813,000) last
year, in addition to share-based compensation of $2.09 million,
the annual report shows. The company discloses individual parts
of compensation in dollars or euros.  Under a separate long-term incentive plan, Murray also
stands to benefit from restricted stock units and awards worth
$5.96 million as of May 1, when they were granted, if he meets
certain targets and remains employed until May 2018.  “Our compensation levels are benchmarked against, and are
comparable with, our global industry peers,” Icon said in a
statement. “The rise in certain compensation levels in 2012
appropriately reflects that this was a very successful year for
Icon.”  Myles Lee, CEO of  CRH Plc (CRH) , Ireland’s largest listed company
with a market value of 11.3 billion euros, earned 2.72 million
euros last year, according to the company’s annual report.  Steve Cutler, president of Icon’s clinical research
services, earned $4.2 million in 2012 including deferred
payments, while Murray’s successor as CFO Brendan Brennan earned
$2.4 million.  To contact the reporter for this story:
