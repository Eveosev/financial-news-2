Paul Jablansky, the head of
structured products at fixed-income manager Western Asset
Management Co., has left the unit of  Legg Mason Inc. (LM)   Jablansky resigned last week from the firm, which  oversees 
about $460 billion, and is still deciding what to do next, he
said today in a telephone interview.  He will be replaced on an interim basis by Dennis McNamara
in overseeing a team of 10 focused on U.S. home-loan bonds
without government backing, commercial-mortgage securities and
asset-backed securities, said  Mary Athridge , a spokeswoman for
Baltimore-based Legg Mason.  “Western is committed to this sector of the market and is
currently in discussion with a couple highly qualified
candidates,” Athridge said in an e-mailed statement. She said
the firm has a “deep and experienced team” that worked with
Jablansky.  Jablansky joined Western Asset in 2011 from Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc, where he was a securitization strategist. He
previously was chief investment officer at hedge-fund manager
400 Capital Management LLC, after serving as global head of
principal finance at Bank of America Corp. through 2008. Ron Mass, who became co-head of structured products when Jablansky
arrived, left in 2012 after 21 years at the firm.  Steve Fulton, who heads  Western Asset ’s investments in
government-backed mortgage securities, “will continue to work
closely” with the managers focusing on non-agency debt, Athridge
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
