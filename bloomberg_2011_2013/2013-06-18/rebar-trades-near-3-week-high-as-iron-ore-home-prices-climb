Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
Shanghai traded near a three-week high after  iron ore  prices
climbed and new  home prices  increased in Chinese cities.  Rebar for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange climbed as much as 0.4 percent to 3,492  yuan  ($570) a
metric ton and was at 3,479 yuan at 10:22 a.m. local time. The
contract yesterday touched 3,508 yuan, the highest since May 28.  Iron ore prices  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port in
China gained 1.2 percent to $115 yesterday, rising for a third
straight day, according to The Steel Index Ltd. The raw material
is a key ingredient for steel production. New home prices rose
in May from a year ago in 69 out 70 cities tracked by  China ’s
statistics bureau, according to a statement on its website
today. That compares with 68 cities in April.  “Higher production costs will provide support for the
steel product for the time being,” Zheng Ge, an analyst at
Wanda Futures Co., said today by phone from Beijing. “Iron ore
prices seem to be supported at the moment given that Chinese
mills have stepped up purchases of iron ore amid lower domestic
mine output.”  The  average spot price  for rebar in China was little
changed at 3,376 yuan a ton yesterday, according to data from
Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
