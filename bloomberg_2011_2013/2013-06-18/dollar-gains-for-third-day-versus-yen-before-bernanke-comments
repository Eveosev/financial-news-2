The dollar fell against all of its
16 most-traded peers amid bets Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  will signal the central bank plans to maintain bond
purchases that risk debasing the currency.  Europe ’s 17-nation currency traded at almost its highest
level against the dollar since February and the yen rallied
before the U.S. central bank also releases revised economic
forecasts. Sweden’s krona rose to a two-month high versus the
dollar after the jobless rate unexpectedly fell in May and a
government research institute said the central bank won’t cut
its main lending rate further.  “Markets are looking for a constructive outcome in terms
of the Fed really explaining and clarifying,”  Vassili Serebriakov , a foreign-exchange strategist at BNP Paribas SA in
 New York , said in a phone interview. “Markets are still
reluctant to put on risk. I don’t think the market expects
Bernanke to completely backtrack on the previous hint of
tapering.”  The dollar fell 0.2 percent to 95.19 yen at 1:33 p.m. in
New York after weakening 1.1 percent in the previous two days.
 Japan ’s currency was little changed at 127.65 per euro. The euro
gained 0.1 percent to $1.3409 after appreciating to $1.3416
yesterday, the highest since Feb. 13.  Technical Levels  The Dollar Index, which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to monitor the greenback against the currencies of six U.S.
trade partners, fell 0.1 percent to 80.531. The gauge’s 80.35 to
80.25 range is “an important test” that may suggest whether
further “retracement” will develop,  Niall O’Connor , a
technical analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York, wrote
today in a report.  South African inflation slowed for the first time in five
months, while the current account deficit unexpectedly shrank,
improving the outlook for Africa’s largest economy. The rand
erased declines and rallied 0.4 percent after the release of the
inflation and current-account data to 9.9561 per dollar.  The ruble slid for a third day on weaker-than-forecast
economic data as Russia canceled its second bond sale this month
and the central bank chairman warned capital outflow remains
“abnormally high.” Russia’s currency weakened 0.6 percent to
32.1895 versus the greenback.  Trading in over-the-counter foreign-exchange options
totaled $20.8 billion, compared with $24.1 billion yesterday,
according to data reported by U.S. banks to the Depository Trust
Clearing Corp. and tracked by Bloomberg. Volume in options on
the dollar-yuan  exchange rate  was $8.8 billion, the largest
share of trades at 42 percent. Dollar-yen options were the
second most actively traded, at $4.9 billion, or 24 percent.  Options Data  Dollar-yuan options trading was 229 percent more than the
average for the past five Wednesdays at a similar time in the
day. U.S. dollar-yen options trading was 27 percent less than
average.  Bernanke will hold a press conference in  Washington 
following the Fed’s two-day meeting. He said on May 22 the
central bank could reduce its monthly purchases of $45 billion
of Treasuries and $40 billion of mortgage securities if the
employment outlook shows sustainable improvement.  The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbed to 2.29
percent on June 11, the highest level since April 2012. It was
little changed today at 2.21 percent.  The JPMorgan Global FX Volatility Index was at 10.58
percent. It climbed to a one-year high of 11.43 percent on June
13, while the average for the past 12 months is 8.65 percent.  Fed Views  “Bernanke’s going to be clear, as clear as the Federal
Reserve chairman is, that they haven’t decided to do anything
except to continue the current policy until the data change
their mind,”  Marc Chandler , chief currency strategist at Brown
Brothers Harriman & Co. in New York, said during an interview on
 Bloomberg Radio ’s “Surveillance” with  Tom Keene  and  Michael McKee . “And so far the data hasn’t changed their mind.”  The yen has strengthened 6.3 percent in the past month, the
best performer among 10 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro rose 1.9 percent, while
the dollar fell 2.8 percent.  The krona rose for a second day after the Swedish National
Institute of  Economic Research  said on its website the Riksbank
will keep its benchmark  interest rate  at 1 percent this year.
The $500 billion economy will grow 1.5 percent this year and 2.5
percent in 2014 after expanding 0.7 percent in 2012, it
predicted, raising estimates from March.  A separate report showed the Swedish  unemployment rate  fell
to 8.2 percent in May from 8.7 percent a month earlier.
Economists had expected a reading of 8.8 percent, according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Sweden Economy  “All in all good Swedish numbers that should further lower
the probability for the Riksbank cutting in July,” strategists
at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Copenhagen wrote in an e-mailed note. “It
points to a further move lower” in the euro against the krona,
they wrote.  Sweden’s krona advanced 0.9 percent to 6.3849 per dollar
after reaching the strongest level since April 16. It gained 0.8
percent to 8.5573 per euro after touching the most since June 3.  New Zealand ’s dollar rose for the first time in four days
after  Statistics New Zealand  said the nation’s current-account
deficit narrowed in the first quarter to 4.8 percent of gross
domestic product from 5 percent in the previous three months.  The kiwi climbed 0.7 percent to 80.45 U.S. cents after
dropping 1.4 percent during the previous three days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
