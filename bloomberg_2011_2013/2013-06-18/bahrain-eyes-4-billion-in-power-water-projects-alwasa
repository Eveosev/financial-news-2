Bahrain plans to spend as much as $4
billion by 2018 on power projects and water desalination plants
to meet demand, Alwasat newspaper said, citing Electricity and
Water Minister Abdul Hussain Ali Mirza.  The minister told the paper the island-kingdom plans to
finance projects with support from the Gulf Cooperation Council
countries, which have pledged $10 billion in aid to boost social
spending and help upgrade infrastructure.  The projects include a second power and desalination plant
at Ad Dur with a generation capacity of 1,200 megawatts,
according to Mirza. The plant will cost about $2 billion and is
expected to open by late 2015 or early 2016, he told the daily.  Bahrain generates 3,418 megawatts of power with almost a
third of that from the existing plant at Ad Dur, according to
statistics from the Electricity and Water Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
