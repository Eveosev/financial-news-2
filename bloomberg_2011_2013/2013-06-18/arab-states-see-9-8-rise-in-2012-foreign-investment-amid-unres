Foreign direct investment into Arab
states rose 9.8 percent to $47.1 billion in 2012 even amid
regional unrest, according to the Arab Investment & Export
Credit Guarantee Corp., which insures such funding against non-commercial risks.  FDI increased in 15 of 20 countries with available data for
last year, the Kuwait-based organization, known as Dhaman, said
in an e-mailed report today. Increased FDI was recorded in all
of the countries that have experienced an Arab Spring except
 Syria , for which there was no available data last year.  The economies of Gulf Cooperation Council states are the
most attractive for investments in the Arab region, Dhaman said.
The  United Arab Emirates  topped the list and held a 20.4 percent
share of total Arab FDI inflows last year, according to the
report. The U.A.E. had an investment growth rate of 25 percent
in 2012 over the previous year, while Kuwait saw FDI increase by
118 percent last year to $1.9 billion, Dhaman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
