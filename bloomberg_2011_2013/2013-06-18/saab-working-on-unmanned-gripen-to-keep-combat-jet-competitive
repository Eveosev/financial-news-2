Saab AB (SAABB)  is working on a version of
its Gripen fighter that could fly without pilots as the company
explores ways to keep the program viable for another 30 years.  “What we are talking about is an optionally manned
aircraft,” Chief Executive Officer Hakan Buskhe said in an
interview at the  Paris Air Show . The concept would follow
development of the Gripen E, an upgraded model of the jet Saab
is developing for the Swedish and Swiss air forces, he said.  The emergence of increasingly sophisticated air defenses is
driving military planners around the world to explore greater
use of unmanned planes to mitigate risk to personnel. The U.S.
is boosting spending to develop unmanned combat aircraft, with
 France  and the U.K. cooperating on an attack drone project and
 China  showing a prototype.  “Just because you need an unmanned fighter does not mean
it is affordable to build a new platform,” Bushke said. “If
you like for a mission you can put a pilot into the aircraft and
if you need to use it for high risk you fly without a pilot.”  Evolving the Gripen E to feature such a capability “is not
a big step,” Bushke said, without saying when such a version
may fly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
