Stuart Pearce  was dropped as coach
of the England Under-21 soccer team after it failed to score a
point at the European Championship in  Israel  earlier this month.  Pearce’s contract, which runs out at the end of this month,
won’t be renewed, the Football Association said in a  statement 
on its website.  Pearce, a former England and Nottingham Forest player, was
told of the decision “following Club England board
discussions,” the F.A. said. He’d been in charge since 2007 and
had led the team to four straight European Championship
tournaments.  Pearce “has done extremely well in qualifying for finals
tournaments, but after the disappointment of the past two
tournaments, we believe it is time to change coach,” F.A.
Chairman David Bernstein said. He thanked Pearce for his “hard
work” and “commitment to the job.”  The England Under-21 side also didn’t make it out of the
group stages in the 2011 European Championship.  To contact the reporter on this story:
