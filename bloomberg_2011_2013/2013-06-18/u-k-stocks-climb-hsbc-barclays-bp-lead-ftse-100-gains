U.K. stocks  climbed, sending the
benchmark  FTSE 100 (UKX)  Index higher for a fourth day, as the  Federal
Reserve  began its two-day meeting on monetary policy.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s largest bank, and  Standard
Chartered Plc (STAN) , both rallied more than 1 percent amid speculation
China may cut  interest rates  to boost growth.  Whitbread Plc (WTB) 
gained 3.6 percent after reporting an increase in sales.  EasyJet
Plc (EZJ)  rose 2.2 percent after agreeing to buy new Airbus SAS jets.  The FTSE 100 rose 43.72 points, or 0.7 percent, to 6,374.21
at the close of trading in London. The gauge has still lost 6.8
percent since May 22 amid concern the Federal Reserve will rein
in its stimulus measures that helped send the FTSE 100 to its
highest level since 1999. The FTSE All-Share Index climbed 0.6
percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index added 0.3 percent.  “With activity so light ahead of the Federal Open Market
Committee announcement, moves in the market are being
accentuated within a tight range,” said Ioan Smith, a
strategist at  Knight Capital  Europe Ltd. in London. “The best
course of action is probably not to read too much into the price
action at this stage.”  The FOMC began its two-day policy meeting today, with Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  scheduled to speak after the central
bank’s rate decision tomorrow. Bernanke may signal the Fed is
close to tapering its quantitative easing program, according to
the Financial Times. The newspaper didn’t cite anyone.  The volume of shares changing hands in companies listed on
the FTSE 100 was 13 percent lower than the average of the past
30 days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China Speculation  Stocks rallied in early morning trading amid speculation
China may ease its monetary policy. The China Securities Journal
reported earlier that interest rates may be cut to help reduce
companies’ debt burdens if the economic slowdown worsens. The
newspaper cited  Liu Yuhui , a researcher at Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences.  “There is unconfirmed speculation of a China rate cut
circulating that is being offered as the reason for move higher
in the market,” said Knight Capital’s Smith. “But it’s more
than likely related to comments from the CASS.”  HSBC climbed 2.1 percent to 696 pence and  Standard
Chartered , which generated about 67 percent of its 2012
operating profit in the Asia-Pacific region, rose 1.8 percent to
1,469.5 pence.  Whitbread climbed 3.6 percent to 3,031 pence, its highest
price since at least 1992. The owner of Premier Inn budget
hotels and Costa coffee shops reported a 3.1 percent increase in
like-for-like sales in the 13 weeks to May 30. Sales at Costa
outlets open at least a year jumped 8 percent while like-for-like sales at Premier Inn advanced 2.7 percent.  EasyJet Buys  EasyJet gained 2.2 percent to 1,279 pence after the low-cost airline agreed to buy 135 Airbus jets worth about $13.22
billion at list price.  Oriel Securities Ltd. said the new aircraft will bring
capacity growth of 3 percent to 5 percent, in line with Ryanair
Holdings Plc. Numis Securities Ltd. upgraded EasyJet to add and
raised its full-year pretax earnings estimate to 441 million
pounds ($690 million) from 416 million pounds.  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  increased 0.9 percent to 184.4 pence
after Liberty Global Plc made a preliminary bid for Kabel
Deutschland Holding AG, pitting the cable company against the
U.K. telecommunications operator for control of Germany’s
largest cable provider.  RSA Upgraded  RSA Insurance Group Plc (RSA)  added 2.2 percent to 120.4 pence as
Credit Suisse Group AG raised its recommendation for the insurer
to outperform, the equivalent of a buy rating, from neutral. The
bank also increased its price estimate for the shares 10 percent
to 138 pence, saying earnings are poised to improve.  Arm Holdings Plc (ARM)  advanced 1.9 percent to 846 pence as
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. unveiled three new products aimed at
making a dent in rival Intel Corp.’s sales. AMD’s products
include its first server chip based on ARM’s technology.  Aggreko Plc (AGK)  lost 2.2 percent to 1,752 pence. The provider
of mobile power supplies forecast underlying first-half revenue
to grow about 5 percent, while trading profit will be in line
with a year earlier.  SDL Plc tumbled 30 percent to 271 pence, its biggest fall
on record, after the U.K. maker of translation software forecast
a drop in full-year earnings and said faltering economic growth
caused first-half earnings to miss the company’s predictions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
