For three years, Christopher Kostow has pestered Momofuku chef  David Chang  to join his “Twelve Days of Christmas” charity dinners.  “Every time I saw David, he would say, ‘I’ll come, I’ll come,’” Kostow said in an interview at Bloomberg world headquarters in  New York .  Luckily for Kostow, Chang, this year’s co-winner of the James Beard Foundation’s award for Outstanding Chef in the U.S., had a break in his December schedule.  Each year Kostow turns over his kitchen at the  Restaurant at Meadowood  in  Napa Valley ,  California , a recipient of three Michelin stars, to some of the world’s best chefs. They create meals keyed to the Christmas song and priced at $395 for the main dining room and $750 for the chef’s counter.  Chang will join Thai-food master Andy Ricker of Pok Pok Ny, Carlo Mirarchi of  Brooklyn  tasting room Blanca, and Rasmus Kofoed, the 2011  Bocuse d’Or  competition winner from the two-Michelin-starred Geranium in Copenhagen.  “We like to invite people who have a culinary point of view,” said Kostow, this year’s winner of the  James Beard Award for Best Chef in the Western U.S . “We are not concerned at all about the price point of their restaurant or how refined or unrefined they are.”  “Twelve Days,” now in its sixth year, has become one of the hot charity dining experiences during the U.S. holiday season. Tickets go on sale today and they usually sell quickly. Enthusiasts in the past have signed up for as many as eight dinners during the two-week event.  Abused Women  Meadowood will donate 20 percent of the event’s proceeds to the  Napa Emergency Women’s Services , which provides aid and shelter for victims of domestic violence, and the  Holly Cranston Memorial Fund , which gives scholarships to those who want to serve people with disabilities.  “At its heart, ‘Twelve Days’ is a charitable event,” Kostow said. “People come without their egos, and we make sure that their needs in the kitchen are well covered.”  “The last night is very celebratory,” said Kostow, who is the featured chef that evening. “It’s both the end of the event and the end of the year, and it’s one of those dinners that last until the wee hours of the morning because no one leaves.”  (The “Twelve Days of Christmas” charity dinners are Dec. 6-21 at the Restaurant at Meadowood, 900 Meadowood Lane in  St. Helena , California. Tickets go on sale today. Information and reservations: +1-707-967-1205 or reservations@therestaurantatmeadowood.com)  Muse highlights include  Joe Mysak  on  books , Philip Boroff on  theater .
