U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew
said there is no evidence of political involvement in Internal
Revenue Service employees targeting politically oriented groups.  Lew’s comments, made to Spanish-language television
Univision today, follow a release of transcripts’ from
interviews that congressional investigators conducted with IRS
employees. Those were triggered by an inspector general report
released in May and saying IRS staff used phrases such as “ Tea
Party ” to determine which applications for tax-exempt status
would receive more attention.  The interview transcripts released so far show no evidence
of influence from outside the IRS and no knowledge by IRS
officials above Lois Lerner, who oversaw tax-exempt
organizations for the agency.  “There’s no evidence that there was any political
involvement. It was actions that were taken within the
management of this program,” Lew said, according to a
transcript sent by Univision. “Anyone whose actions in this
area were inappropriate will be held accountable.”  Separately, Lew expressed his support for an overhaul of
immigration laws and said adding legal immigrants would help
fund  Social Security  and Medicare.  “It means tens of billions of dollars into the Medicare
trust fund,” he said. “The combination of fairness and
economic opportunity come together in immigration reform. And
that’s why I think you’re seeing so much bipartisan interest in
getting it done.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
