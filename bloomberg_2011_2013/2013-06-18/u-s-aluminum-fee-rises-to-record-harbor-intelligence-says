The fee buyers pay to obtain
aluminum in the U.S. climbed to a record amid longer waits for
warehouse supplies and reduced availability of scrap metal,
 Harbor Intelligence  said.  The so-called Midwest premium is 12 cents to 13 cents a
pound, an all-time high, according to Harbor Intelligence, an
Austin, Texas-based researcher. The fee was 11.75 cents to 12.5
cents earlier this month. The surcharge is added to the price of
aluminum for immediate delivery on the London Metal Exchange.  “A steady supply of metal is getting into warehouses and
lengthening queues,” Jorge Vazquez, a managing director at
Harbor, said in a telephone interview. “We’re also seeing
tighter markets for scrap and off-grade metals, as well as a
slight pickup in physical demand outside the LME.”  Orders to remove aluminum from warehouses monitored by the
LME in  Detroit , the biggest U.S. repository of the metal, have
jumped 28 percent in the past 12 months, bourse data show.  Backlogs have grown as more metal gets tied up in financing
deals that typically involve the purchase of metal for nearby
delivery and a forward sale to take advantage of a market in
contango, where prices rise into the future.  To contact the reporter on this story:
