Hong Kong  stocks  declined amid
concern a broad gain in Chinese  home prices  will limit the scope
for monetary easing. GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. plunged after
a unit of China’s sovereign-wealth fund agreed to sell a stake
in the company.  GCL-Poly sank 12 percent after Chengdong Investment Corp.
offered 1.2 billion shares in the largest maker of materials
used in solar panels.  Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science &
Technology Co. (1157)  retreated 1.1 percent after the machinery maker
said a former employee took bribes and sold company secrets.  The Hang Seng Index lost 0.8 percent to 21,056.33 as of
9:50 a.m. in Hong Kong. About nine shares fell for each that
rose on the 50-member gauge, with volume 11 percent above the
30-day intraday average. The Hang Seng  China  Enterprises Index
slid 1.1 percent to 9,640.79.  “Any expansion of policy by the government and central
bank will be limited,” said Ben Tam, a Hong Kong-based fund
manager who helps oversee about $1.5 billion at IG Investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
