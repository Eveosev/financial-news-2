New Jersey  Governor  Chris Christie ,
a Republican seeking a second term in November, said he doesn’t
need to decide whether to run for president until 2015.  The governor, 50, also said he won’t concern himself with
attacks from fellow Republicans. He said on  MSNBC ’s “Morning
Joe” that he’s “shocked” by inaction and partisanship in
Congress.  Christie’s calls for smaller government and lower taxes
have made him a national Republican figure. In October 2011 he
turned down requests to run for president, saying he couldn’t
abandon his commitment to help New Jersey recover from the
recession. He hasn’t ruled out a 2016 White House bid.  “Probably not until 2015,” he said when asked about how
soon he needs to decide on a presidential announcement following
his re-election bid. “What I think we should be focused on is
nominating the best possible candidate we can in 2016 who can
get elected.”  Republicans at the state level, including the party’s
governors and legislators, are “doers and pragmatists,”
Christie said. At the national level, Congress has a record-low
approval rating and President  Barack Obama , a Democrat, hasn’t
done enough to win over lawmakers, he said.  “Almost anything I see that comes from the floor of
Congress from both parties shocks me,” Christie said. “People
are playing the end zones. No one is playing the middle of the
field and no one is trying to get anything done. They’re yelling
at each other.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
