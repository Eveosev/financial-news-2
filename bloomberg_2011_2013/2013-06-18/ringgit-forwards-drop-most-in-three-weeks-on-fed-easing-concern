Malaysia’s ringgit forwards fell the
most in almost three weeks on speculation the  Federal Reserve 
will unwind stimulus that has spurred inflows to emerging
markets. Government bonds were little changed.  The Fed starts a two-day meeting today, after a report
yesterday showed confidence among U.S. homebuilders surged in
June to the highest level in seven years. Fed Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said last month stimulus could be reduced if the jobs
outlook shows sustainable improvement. Malaysian inflation
probably held at an 11-month high of 1.7 percent in May,
according to economists in a Bloomberg survey before official
figures due June 19.  “There’s still concern and risk of capital outflows and
what the Fed might say in terms of asset-purchase tapering,”
said  Sacha Tihanyi , a foreign-exchange strategist at Bank of
Nova Scotia in Hong Kong. “That’s the prime concern.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards declined 1.1 percent,
the most since May 29, to 3.2094 as of 9:55 a.m. in  Kuala
Lumpur , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Non-deliverable
forwards are settled in dollars. The contracts to fix the
exchange rate in a year’s time were at a 1.9 percent discount to
the spot rate, which slipped 0.6 percent to 3.1509.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, climbed 29 basis
points, or 0.29 percentage point, to 9.15 percent. The yield on
the 3.26 percent government bonds due March 2018 held at 3.26
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
