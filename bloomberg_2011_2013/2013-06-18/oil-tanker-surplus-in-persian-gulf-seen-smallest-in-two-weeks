The  surplus  of tankers competing to
ship 2 million-barrel oil cargoes from ports in the  Persian Gulf 
fell to a two-week low, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  There are 15 percent more very large crude carriers seeking
charters over the next 30 days than probable shipments from the
world’s largest cargo-loading region, the median in the survey
of four shipbrokers and two owners showed today. The glut was
the lowest since June 4 and compared with 18 percent last week.  The VLCC fleet’s capacity expanded 39 percent in the past
five years, according to data from IHS Fairplay, a Redhill,
England-based maritime-research company. Seaborne crude-oil
imports will average 38.4 million barrels a day this year, 0.5
percent more than in 2008, according to Clarkson Plc, the
world’s largest shipbroker.  Freight rates for VLCCs on the benchmark route to Asia from
the  Middle East  slumped 1.4 percent yesterday to 41.75 industry-standard Worldscale points, according to figures from the  Baltic
Exchange  in  London . That equated to daily earnings of $15,016,
the lowest since June 12, the data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
