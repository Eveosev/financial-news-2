Skylar Capital Management LP, a
Houston hedge fund that spun off from Centaurus Advisors LLC
last year, hired Loftus Fitzwater to trade natural gas.  Fitzwater, 42, has worked for Citadel Investment Group
Inc., Fortis Energy Marketing & Trading, and Enron Corp., Mitch
Ackles, a spokesman for Skylar, said in an e-mail today. Bill Perkins founded Skylar last year after  John Arnold  announced he
was closing Centaurus.  Skylar is one of at least two  hedge funds  to emerge from
the breakup of Centaurus. The firm had raised $102 million from
five investors as of October, according to a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.  Another Centaurus spinoff, Copperwood Energy Fund LP, had
raised more than $743 million from 50 investors as of November,
SEC records show. Copperwood is run by former Enron President
Lawrence “Greg” Whalley.  Arnold, a former Enron trader who became a billionaire
betting on natural gas prices, said in a May 2012 letter
obtained by  Bloomberg News  that he was shutting Centuarus “to
pursue other interests.” The fund gained fame betting against
Amaranth Advisors LLC, a hedge fund that collapsed in 2006 after
losing $6.6 billion on bad  natural gas  gets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
