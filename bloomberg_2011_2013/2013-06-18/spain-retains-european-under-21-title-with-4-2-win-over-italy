Captain Thiago Alcantara scored
three goals as Spain defeated Italy 4-2 in the final to retain
its European Under-21 soccer title.  Barcelona’s Thiago opened the scoring in the sixth minute
in  Jerusalem  and Ciro Immobile leveled four minutes later.
Thiago then added two more goals, one from the penalty spot,
before halftime and Isco scored a second penalty in the 66th
minute.  Fabio Borini got a goal back for Italy 10 minutes from the
end.  It’s the fourth time that Spain has won the title. The
nation’s senior team is the world and European champion.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
