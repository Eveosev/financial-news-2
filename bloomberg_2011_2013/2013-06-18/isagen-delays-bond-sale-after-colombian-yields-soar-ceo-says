Isagen SA (ISAGEN) , Colombia’s second-biggest
publicly traded power company by sales, said it will delay a
planned bond sale to August or September after credit costs in
the country surged to 16-month highs.  The surge in bond yields in the past six weeks is behind
the postponement after the board approved a 1.6 trillion-peso
($840 million) debt sale on May 30 to tap low funding costs,
Chief Executive Officer Luis Fernando Rico said today.  “We went to the board and told them that the conditions
were excellent and asked for authorization to acquire new
funding, and right at that moment the market changed,” he said
in an interview in Bogota.  Yields on  Colombia ’s dollar-denominated bonds due 2024 rose
as much as 120 basis points, or 1.2 percentage point, since the
beginning of May, as speculation the US Federal Reserve may curb
its asset-purchase program lured money away from emerging-market
economies.  “We are going to see how the conditions develop,” said
Rico. “We are waiting for it to stabilize because this is a
period with a lot of turbulence.”  Isagen is developing the Sogamoso hydroelectric plant that
will increase the company’s installed capacity by 42 percent and
earnings before items by as much as 80 percent, he said. The
plant probably will begin in July or August next year, ahead of
its previous scheduled December start date, said Rico.  To contact the reporter on this story:
