Argentina ’s  Supreme Court  blocked
part of the judicial changes proposed by President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  in a move that threatens to stall her
ambitions to “democratize” the nation’s legal system.  The court ruled today that proposed changes to the
selection of members of the council of magistrates is
unconstitutional, according to a copy of the ruling published by
the Court information  website . Six of seven judges objected to
the proposed changes, saying they were against the principles
established in the 1853 Constitution amended in 1994.  Argentina’s Congress approved four bills in May promoted by
Fernandez, including limits on injunctions against the state and
expanding the number of members on the council of magistrates, a
body that oversees judges’ rulings and conduct. According to the
bill, new council members would be elected through popular vote.  “Powers are limited,” the majority six judges said in the
ruling. “If somebody wants to change this, the Constitution
should be modified.”  Fernandez, 60, has clashed with the courts over the last
year as government initiatives including the regulation of media
groups and the expropriation of the Rural Society’s grounds in
 Buenos Aires  have been left unenforceable through injunctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
