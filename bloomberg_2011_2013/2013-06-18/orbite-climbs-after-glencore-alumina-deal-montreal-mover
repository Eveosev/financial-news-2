Orbite Aluminae Inc. (ORT) , a developer of
mineral deposits in  Quebec , rose the most in four weeks after it
said  Glencore Xstrata Plc (POT)  will buy output from a proposed
alumina plant in the Canadian province.  Orbite climbed 23 percent to 86 Canadian cents in Toronto,
the biggest one-day gain for the Montreal-based company’s  shares 
since May 21.  Glencore, based in Baar, Switzerland, agreed to buy all of
the smelter-grade alumina from the facility under a 10-year off-take agreement when commercial production begins, Orbite said
yesterday in a statement after the markets closed. Alumina is a
raw material used to make aluminum.  “The agreement also foresees that Orbite and Glencore will
undertake negotiations relating to Glencore’s potential
financial participation in the ownership and operation” of the
proposed plant, Orbite said in the statement.  No timetable has been set for the talks, Orbite said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
