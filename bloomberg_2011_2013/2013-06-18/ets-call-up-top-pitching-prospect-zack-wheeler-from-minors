The  New York  Mets have called up top
pitching prospect Zack Wheeler to start the second game of
today’s double-header against the  Atlanta Braves .  Wheeler, a 23-year-old right-hander, had a 4-2 record with
a 3.93 earned run average in 13 starts this season for the Mets’
Triple-A minor league affiliate in  Las Vegas . After going 0-1
with a 5.79 ERA in his first five starts, he’s won four games
with a 2.98 ERA in his past eight appearances.  “This kid is very, very talented,” Mets manager Terry Collins said before yesterday’s game. “We’re very lucky to have
him. Everybody is looking forward to seeing him pitch.”  Wheeler was the sixth overall pick by  San Francisco  in the
2009 Major League Baseball draft and joined the Mets as part of
the 2011 trade that sent  Carlos Beltran  to the Giants.  Wheeler joined a Mets’ rotation that also features 24-year-old Matt Harvey, who pitches today’s first game and is 5-1 with
a 2.04 ERA in 14 starts this season.  “It’s a great thing for this organization and the fan base
to look forward to see what the future’s going to be like,”
Collins said. “We’ve got two young guys that have a chance to
be very, very good. Pitching is the name of this game, and we’re
going to run two guys out there who can take this organization
north pretty fast.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
