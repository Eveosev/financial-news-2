Smithfield Foods Inc. (SFD) , the U.S. hog
producer that agreed last month to be acquired by Shuanghui
International Holdings Ltd., got another $34-a-share offer from
a foreign company.  Talks between the other bidder ended because the potential
acquirer couldn’t announce a bid earlier than June 13,
Smithfield said today in its proxy statement. Smithfield
announced May 29 that it would be acquired by Shuanghui for $34
a share.  The other bidder wasn’t identified by Smithfield, which
described it as a publicly traded, non-U.S. company. That
company initially approached Smithfield in April indicating it
was interested in acquiring a minority stake in the company,
according to the filing.  Thailand’s  Charoen Pokphand Foods Pcl (CPF)  and Brazil’s  JBS SA (JBSS3) 
were preparing bids for Smithfield before the U.S. company
agreed to the $4.72 billion offer from  China ’s Shuanghui, people
familiar with the matter said May 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
