Boeing Co. (BA)  Chief Executive Officer
Jim McNerney may seek to stay past the age of 65 even though the
company’s practice has been for CEOs to retire at that age.  “There are rules that are easily waived,” he told
journalists at the  Paris Air Show  today. “They have been in the
past.”  McNerney has been chairman and chief executive of Boeing
since 2005, overseeing the development of the 787 Dreamliner.
The Chicago-based company introduced the 787-10, a new version
of that plane today and is about to develop an upgraded version
of the popular twin-engine 777 as Boeing seeks to defend its
lead in large jets over rival Airbus SAS.  “I love my job. I’m having a good time,” he said during a
Boeing reception at the show. “There’s no official time that I
have to depart. There is a practice.”  Editors: Niamh Ring, Cecile Daurat  To contact the reporters on this story:
