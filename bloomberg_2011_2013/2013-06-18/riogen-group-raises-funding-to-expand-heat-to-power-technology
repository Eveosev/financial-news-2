Triogen Group BV , a Dutch maker of
equipment that turns waste heat into electricity and water,
raised 6.5 million euros ($8.7 million) to expand.  New investor Wadinko NV led the funding round, which also
attracted existing investor Yellow&Blue Investment Management
BV, Goor-based Triogen said today in a  statement .  Triogen’s technology can be installed in biomass power
stations, factories and wastewater-treatment plants. The company
is benefiting from increased demand to convert waste heat into
electricity and hot water as businesses from manufacturers to
utilities seek to generate cleaner power and boost efficiency.  “We see significant opportunities for our technology,”
Director Ron Aan de Stegge said in the statement. Triogen, which
operates in  Europe , made its first sales in Finland, Slovakia
and  Latvia  in the first half, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
