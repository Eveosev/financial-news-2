Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP) , the
solar-panel manufacturer involved in bankruptcy proceedings in
China, said Swiss judicial authorities extended a moratorium on
creditor claims on its European unit.  Suntech Power International Ltd. was granted a six month
moratorium in Schaffhausen, Switzerland, that may be extended,
the Wuxi, China-based company said yesterday in a statement.  “The definitive moratorium allows SPI time to restructure
debt and reach an agreement with creditors,” Suntech Chief
Executive Officer David King said in the statement. “SPI will
continue normal operations during this process.  Suntech climbed 5 percent to $1.05 at the close in  New York 
yesterday.  The European unit was granted a two-month provisional
moratorium on creditor claims on April 9. Suntech was the
world’s biggest panel supplier in 2011.  Creditors in  China  pulled Suntech’s main operating unit
into bankruptcy proceedings in March after the company defaulted
on a $541 million bond. Bondholders sued Suntech in New York
June 11 over unpaid principal on convertible senior notes, plus
other costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
