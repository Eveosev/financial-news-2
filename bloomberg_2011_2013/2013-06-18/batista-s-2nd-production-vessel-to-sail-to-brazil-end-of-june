OSX Brasil SA (OSXB3) , billionaire  Eike Batista ’s shipbuilder, is getting ready to send a second
production vessel to Brazil, where it is expected to start
pumping crude before the end of this year.  The $800 million OSX-3 production unit is in Singapore and
will leave for Brazil around the end of June,  Modec Inc. (6269) , the
company OSX hired to build the vessel, said in an e-mailed reply
to questions. The vessel, known as an FPSO, will arrive in
Brazil in the third quarter after it was christened on May 31,
OSX said in an e-mail.  OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes SA , the oil producer
Batista controls, plans to use the vessel at the Tubarao Martelo
field in the Campos basin where Petroliam Nasional Bhd., or
Petronas, agreed on May 8 to buy a 40 percent stake in the field
for $850 million. The deal is contingent on OGX meeting
production targets.  OGX has lost 82 percent this year after output at its first
project, Tubarao Azul, missed estimates and had to temporarily
shut two of its three wells to replace pumps. OSX, the company
that relies on OGX for most of its revenue, is down 81 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
