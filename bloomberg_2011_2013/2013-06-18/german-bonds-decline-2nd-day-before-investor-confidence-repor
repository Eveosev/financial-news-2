Germany ’s bonds dropped for a second
day as investors weighed what Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will say about the central bank’s asset-purchase
program when he holds a press conference tomorrow.  The 10-year bund yield rose from near the lowest level in a
week after a German report showed investor confidence improved
in June, damping demand for the euro area’s safest assets.
Portuguese securities rose after the European Union said it may
help the nation exit its aid program. Finland’s bonds declined
as the nation auctioned 1.5 billion euros ($2 billion) of debt.
Bernanke said last month the Fed could reduce quantitative
easing if the job market shows sustainable improvement.  “The market is completely focused on the tapering topic,”
said Marius Daheim, a senior fixed-income strategist at
 Bayerische Landesbank  in Munich. “Bernanke will tread very
carefully on the topic of QE tapering and that will fit very
well with bund yields staying in a range of 1.50 to 1.60
percent.”  Germany’s 10-year bund yield rose five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 1.57 percent at 4:32 p.m.  London  time.
The rate fell to 1.51 percent yesterday, the lowest level since
June 7. The 1.5 percent security due in May 2023 dropped 0.435,
or 4.35 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 99.37.  The 10-year bund yield will climb to 1.60 percent in three
months, Bayerische Landesbank’s Daheim forecast.  Sentiment Improves  Bernanke said on May 22 the U.S. central bank could reduce
its monthly purchases of $85 billion of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities if the employment outlook shows sustained
improvement.  An  index  of investor and analyst expectations in Germany
climbed to 38.5 this month from 36.4 in May, the ZEW Center for
European Economic Research in Mannheim said. That’s higher than
the 38.1 forecast by the median of 38 estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey of economists.  Portugal ’s bonds rose after EU Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said in Brussels the EU is
looking at possible “precautionary arrangements” that might
help the nation and Ireland exit their aid programs.  The yield on Portuguese 10-year bonds slid 16 basis points
to 6.09 percent. The rate on similar-maturity Irish debt was
little changed at 3.90 percent.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said officials
were considering further non-standard monetary policy tools.  Draghi has in recent months held out the possibility of
charging lenders to hold cash at the ECB by introducing a
negative deposit rate, one of several measures that may be
considered in attempts stimulate the euro-area economy.  ‘Open Mind’  “We will look with an open mind at these measures that are
especially effective in our institutional setup and that fall
within our mandate,” Draghi said in  Jerusalem . “Some of those
measures may have unintended consequences. This does not mean
that they should not be used, but it does mean that we need to
be aware of those consequences and manage them appropriately.”  Finland  auctioned 1 billion euros of bonds due in April
2023 at a record-low  average yield  of 1.774 percent and 500
million euros of 2042 securities at 2.547 percent. The nation
last sold 10-year  government bonds  on Oct. 23 at 1.806 percent.
It allotted 30-year debt the same day at 2.588 percent.  Finland’s 10-year bond yield climbed four basis points to
1.81 percent.  German Auction  Germany is scheduled to auction 5 billion euros of 10-year
bunds tomorrow. It last sold the securities at an average yield
of 1.41 percent on May 22, up from a  record low  of 1.36 percent
at a sale on April 17. Investors bid for 1.58 times the bunds on
offer last month.  “Any nervousness ahead of Wednesday evening’s FOMC
statement, along with the small back-up in yield recently, could
support the auction,”  Huw Worthington , a fixed-income
strategist at Barclays Plc in London, wrote in an e-mailed
investor report today.  Volatility on Danish bonds was the highest among European
markets today followed by those of Sweden and Germany, according
to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and
10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Denmark’s 10-year yield rose five basis points to 1.68
percent after  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE) , the nation’s biggest lender, was
told by the country’s financial watchdog it had underestimated
risky assets.  The Financial Supervisory Authority ordered the bank to
adjust its models in a step that will force it to add about 100
billion kroner ($18 billion), or 13 percent, to risk-weighted
assets “over time,” according to a statement late yesterday.  German bonds handed investors a loss of 0.7 percent this
year through yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond
Indexes. Spanish securities returned 5.7 percent and Italian
bonds earned 3.1 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
