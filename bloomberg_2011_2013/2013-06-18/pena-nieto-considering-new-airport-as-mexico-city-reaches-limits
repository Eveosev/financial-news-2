Mexico  is studying a plan to build a
new airport for its capital, among other potential measures, to
alleviate congestion in the busiest hub in  Latin America ,
President Enrique Pena Nieto said.  Plans under consideration include replacing Benito Juarez
International and expanding airports near Mexico City such as in
Toluca and Puebla, Pena Nieto said in an interview yesterday in
 London . He said the government may opt to overhaul the existing
Mexico City airport, which traces its roots to an airfield that
was built in 1928 and later updated.  The capital’s airport surpassed its hourly limit on
takeoffs and landings by an average of once a week last year,
 according  to the Ministry of Communications and Transportation,
which is in talks with airlines to move more flights to non-peak
times. Mexican carriers including  Grupo Aeromexico SAB (AEROMEX*)  pushed
aircraft purchasing to a record in 2012 as the nation’s air
passenger traffic rose at the fastest pace since 2007.  “It’s evident that Mexico City’s airport is saturated,”
Pena Nieto said. “It’s evident that we need to take precautions
already and we’re doing studies and evaluations related to the
eventual modernization of the current airport, or the
possibility of building a new airport.”  He didn’t provide details for when the government will
decide whether to build a new airport, how much investment would
be required or where the project would be located.  To contact the reporters on this story:
