Wheat may extend a slump in the year
starting from July as farmers around the world are set to boost
production and as demand declines for the grain in livestock
feed, an Australian government forecaster said.  The price at Gulf ports for hard-red winter wheat, the most
exported U.S. variety, may average $315 a metric ton in the 12
months from July 1 compared with $320 forecast in March and $348
a year earlier, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and
Resource Economics and Sciences said in a  report . World output
will probably gain 5.3 percent to 690 million tons, it said.  Wheat, corn and soybeans that surged as drought cut output
in 2012 have tumbled into bear markets, helping ease global food
costs. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  estimates world wheat
output will climb 6.1 percent as bigger harvests in  Australia 
and  Canada  counter a smaller U.S. crop. The downside potential
for crop prices is the biggest trading opportunity across
commodities, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. says.  “For grain markets in general, it’ll be the first time in
three or four years that the world will be building grain
stocks,” said  Paul Deane , an agricultural economist at
 Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  in  Melbourne .
“That’s the key reason why we’re looking at lower prices.”  Australia increased its harvest estimate last week after
rains improved soil moisture. Output is set to reach 25.4
million tons, 2 percent more than a March estimate and compared
with 22.1 million tons a year earlier, Abares said June 12.  Global Harvests  Farmers worldwide will harvest 695.9 million tons in
2013-14 from 655.6 million tons a year earlier, the USDA said
June 12. A 6.6 percent increase from Canada and gains of 43
percent in Russia and 24 percent in Ukraine will counter an 8.3
percent drop in the U.S., the agency forecasts.  The rebound follows dry conditions last year that hurt
harvests from  Russia  to Australia and pushed prices to $9.4725 a
bushel on July 23, the highest level since 2008. Wheat for
September delivery gained 0.4 percent to $6.9075 a bushel on the
Chicago Board of Trade today. The contract is down 14 percent
this year.  The “price decline largely reflects the combined effect of
an expected increase in world wheat production,” Abares said.
The outlook for higher corn production may reduce demand for
wheat used in livestock feed, it said.  Corn Output  World corn output will climb 12 percent in 2013-14 to 960
million tons on a record U.S. crop, Abares said. U.S. farmers
will harvest 355.7 million tons in the year beginning Sept. 1,
boosting  world  output to the highest ever, the USDA estimates.
While plants are maturing behind the normal pace after excess
rain, the USDA said yesterday that corn crops were in better
 condition  than in the previous week.  Global  food prices  have dropped 9.5 percent from a record
237.9 points in February 2011, data from the  United Nations ’
Food & Agriculture Organization show. Hard-red winter wheat,
used to make bread, is the largest variety produced and exported
by the U.S., the world’s biggest shipper, according to the USDA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
