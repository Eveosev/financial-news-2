Sun Life Financial Inc. (SLF) ,  Canada ’s
third-largest insurer, signed a C$150 million ($147 million)
deal with the Canadian Wheat Board to take on the risk of
funding its  pension plan .  Sun Life will assume risk of inflation-linked pensions of
the board’s members, the Toronto-based insurer said today in a
statement. It’s the largest single-day purchase of inflation-linked annuities in Canada, Sun Life said.  “It’s a game changer in Canada,” Brent Simmons, Sun
Life’s senior managing director of defined benefit solutions,
said in a phone interview from Toronto. “For the companies that
have made the decision to transfer that risk to an insurer, it’s
a proactive step that let’s the company focus on its core
business.”  Employers are seeking ways to manage obligations linked to
workforces. Verizon Communications Inc. agreed last year to
transfer about $7.5 billion in pension obligations to Prudential
Financial Inc.  Sun Life said it has C$94 billion of fixed-income assets
under management. The Canadian Wheat Board, based in Winnipeg,
Manitoba, is a marketer of wheat and barley and said it has sold
grain to more than 70 countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
