Kenya  Airways Ltd., sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s third-largest airline, declined to the lowest level
since 2004 after it reported its second annual loss in four
years.  The company’s shares, the second-worst performers in Kenya
this year, dropped 3.9 percent to 10 shillings by the 3 p.m.
close in the capital Nairobi, the lowest since April 2004. About
2.7 million shares were traded, more than six times the three-month average volume.  The carrier posted a loss of 7.86 billion shillings ($92
million) in the 12 months through March, compared with a profit
of 1.66 billion shillings a year earlier, it said on June 14.
Kenya Airways failed to boost passenger numbers and revenue was
eroded by a stronger shilling, it said. The shares retreated 6.5
percent since the announcement.  “Some investors are re-shifting their portfolio,” Linet Muriungi, a research analyst at Nairobi-based Kestrel Capital
( East Africa ) Ltd., said today by phone. “They are lightening
their weight in Kenya Airways until the company gets the
business in order because some of the reasons for the poor
performance are fundamental.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
