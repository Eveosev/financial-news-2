Emirates President  Tim Clark  said
the stretched version of the  Boeing Co. (BA)  Dreamliner unveiled
today may lack the capacity to satisfy its fleet requirements.  The 787-10, for which Boeing has been drumming up orders at
the  Paris Air Show , might not meet the needs of the world’s
largest international airline given operational constraints at
its Dubai hub, Clark said in an interview.  Emirates pushed for a larger 787 during the Dreamliner’s
development and refrained from orders when Boeing opted to build
the smaller -8 and -9 variants first. The average size of the
Gulf carrier’s planes has been swollen by record numbers of
Airbus SAS A380 superjumbos and Boeing 777s, while Dubai
International airport is reaching its capacity limits.  “We’ll certainly study the 787-10, but it could be a tad
small for us,” Clark said in Paris, where he’s attending the
world’s biggest aviation expo. The model would need to have a
range of 4,000 nautical miles (7,400 kilometers) and be able to
carry a 50-ton load to come into the reckoning for Emirates, he
said.  There may be more scope to add Dreamliners once the airline
moves to the bigger  Dubai World (DPW)  Central airport, removing
capacity hurdles, Clark said. The largest Dreamliner seats about
330 passengers, compared with 368 passengers on the 777-300ER,
of which Emirates is the biggest operator.  Emirates also has orders for 70 Airbus A350s, the model
developed by the European company when carriers pressed to a
response to the 787 targeted at a higher seating range.  A380 Block  “In the days when we placed the A350 order, the Dreamliner
was too small,” Clark said. “The 787-10 wasn’t launched and
the -8 and -9 were no good for us.”  The first flight of the new Airbus A35-900 last week
“looked fine,” Clark said. “It stayed up there for four hours
and didn’t come racing back,” he said. “They exceeded their
expectations.”  Emirates is unlikely to be able to add further Airbus A380s
to the world’s biggest superjumbo fleet until a scarcity of
specially designed boarding gates at its current base is
resolved, and perhaps not until a firm timetable for the move to
Dubai World has been set, the executive said.  Clark said he’s eager for Boeing to press ahead with a
commitment to build an upgraded 777 plane, its largest twin-engine airliner, to help meet a requirement for the replacement
of existing aircraft and the development of routes spanning as
many as 20 hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
