Elena Kolchina, head of fixed income
at Renaissance Asset Managers, said she is leaving the Moscow
investment firm following its acquisition by Kazimir Partners.  Kolchina, who joined nine years ago from ING Groep NV, will
start in “a new place” on July 1, she said in e-mailed
comments, without providing further details. Mary Zerner, a
London-based spokeswoman for Renaissance, declined to comment.  Kazimir, a hedge-fund firm focusing on  Russia  and the
former Soviet Union nations, bought the fund manager in March
from founder Stephen Jennings, whose Renaissance Capital
investment bank has been dismantled over the past year. Started
in 2003, Renaissance Asset Managers employs more than 50 people
and oversees $2.8 billion in  emerging markets , according to its
website.  Kazimir Partners was founded in 2002 by Frank Mosier and
Dmitri Kryukov, both former senior executives at RenCap. It’s
currently merging its team and funds with those of Renaissance,
which focused on Russia, eastern Europe and Africa.  Jennings left Renaissance Capital in November after his
billionaire partner,  Mikhail Prokhorov , rebuffed requests for
additional cash. A New Zealand native, Jennings surrendered his
stake in RenCap and kept control of Renaissance Asset, urban
development projects in  Africa , consumer lending in Nigeria and
real estate funds in Russia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
