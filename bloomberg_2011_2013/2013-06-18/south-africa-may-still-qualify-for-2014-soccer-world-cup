South Africa still has a chance of
qualifying for the World Cup in  Brazil  next year after Ethiopia
admitted to fielding an ineligible player.  Ethiopia, which leads Group A in the Africa qualification
zone, will be deducted 3 points and fined 6,000 Swiss francs
($6,500) after the error in a 2-1 win against Botswana on June
8, said Sahilu Gebremariam, the head of the country’s football
federation.  “There is no way to appeal to FIFA” world soccer’s
governing body, he said in a phone interview from the capital,
Addis Ababa, today. “We accept the allegation.”  The situation means South Africa can make it to the finals
even after losing 2-1 to Ethiopia in Addis Ababa on June 16.
They will be two points behind the East Africans going into the
final game of the initial African qualifying phase.  Ethiopian administrators failed to communicate to the team
management an instruction from FIFA that Minyahil Teshome Beyene
was suspended for receiving two yellow cards in previous
matches, Sahilu said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
