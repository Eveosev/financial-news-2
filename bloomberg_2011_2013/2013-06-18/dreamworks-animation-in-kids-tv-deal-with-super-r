DreamWorks Animation SKG (DWA)  will sell
half-hour television shows for children based on films including
“How to Train Your Dragon” to Germany’s Super RTL channel.  The five-year licensing agreement includes more than 1,100
half-hours installments of programming for Cologne-based Super
RTL, a children’s TV station, the companies said today in a
statement.  DreamWorks is expanding its television operations to create
revenue sources to supplement its feature film business. The
Glendale, California-based company said yesterday it will supply
 Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  with TV shows based on new movies and characters
from its library, including “Casper the Friendly Ghost” and
“The Lone Ranger.”  DreamWorks will begin delivering programs to Super RTL in
September, the companies said. “How to Train Your Dragon” and
a series based on the movie “Turbo,” scheduled for release in
the U.S. on July 17, will be the first to air on the channel,
they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
