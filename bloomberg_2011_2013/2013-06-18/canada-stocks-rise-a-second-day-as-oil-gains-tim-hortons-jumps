Canadian  stocks  rose to a one-week
high as energy producers climbed with oil prices and investors
await the outcome of a Federal Reserve meeting for clues to the
central bank’s stimulus plans.  Tim Hortons Inc. (THI)  gained the most in 22 months after
activist investor Scout Capital Management LLC bought a 5.5
percent stake. Petrominerales Ltd. jumped 14 percent as its
chief executive officer said it has received interest for
pipeline assets. Encana Corp. and Talisman Energy Inc. advanced
at least 1.8 percent after crude rose. BlackBerry gained 4
percent after an analyst with RBC Capital Markets increased his
shipment estimates for the BB10 smartphones.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 78.56
points, or 0.6 percent, to 12,367.46 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. The
gauge has rallied 1.5 percent in the past two days to the
highest level since June 10. Trading volume was 12 percent lower
than the 30-day average.  “From a sentiment standpoint we’ve had a lot of lousy
days, and I think it was overdone on the downside,” John Stephenson, fund manager with First Asset Investment Management
Inc., said from Toronto. He helps manage C$2.70 billion ($2.65
billion) at the firm. “It’s idiotic if people didn’t realize
that stimulus was going to end at some point. In  Canada ,
everything that was interest-rate sensitive was slaughtered.
People have reassessed things and said effectively, rates will
back up but we’ve sold way beyond that.”  The Fed’s policy-setting Open Market Committee begins two
days of meetings today. Officials in recent months have debated
whether to scale back, or taper, their $85 billion a month in
bond purchases as the world’s largest economy continues its
recovery. The U.S. is Canada’s largest trading partner.  June Decline  The benchmark Canadian stock index has  declined  2.2 percent
in June and is down 0.5 percent for the year, making it the
third-worst performer among 24 developed markets in 2013.  Nine of 10 industries in the S&P/TSX advanced today.
Technology companies, energy stocks and producers of consumer-discretionary products rose at least 1.2 percent to pace gains.  BlackBerry, formerly known as Research In Motion Ltd.,
increased 4 percent to C$15.13. Mark Sue, analyst with RBC
Capital Markets, raised his estimates for BB10 smartphone
shipments to 3.5 million from 2.75 million in the first quarter
and 4 million from 3 million in the second.  Oil and gas stocks rose 1.2 percent as a group, for a two-week high. Encana added 2.6 percent to C$18.48 and Suncor Energy
Inc. rose 1.6 percent to C$31.75.  Pipeline Stakes  Petrominerales soared 14 percent to C$6.82, the highest
level since March 12, after saying it has received interest from
prospective buyers of oil pipeline stakes and disclosing an oil
discovery at one of its wells in Colombia.  Talisman Energy increased 1.8 percent to C$12.05. The
company is considering selling its shale holdings in  Texas  for
as much as $2 billion, Reuters said, referring to people
familiar with the deal.  Health care stocks rose 0.8 percent. Valeant
Pharmaceuticals International Inc. added 1.7 percent to C$87.74.
The drugmaker has scheduled a bank meeting for this Wednesday to
begin a $9.3 billion financing for its planned purchase of
Bausch & Lomb, Reuters said.  Tim Hortons rallied 4 percent to C$56.05 for its biggest
gain since August 2011. New York-based hedge fund Scout Capital
 said  in a filing it has “engaged in discussions” with the
coffee and doughnut retailer regarding its capital structure,
spending, share buybacks and compensation.  Raw-materials producers were the only group in the
benchmark index to retreat. The S&P/TSX Gold Index fell 3
percent, with 26 of 29 members declining. The precious metal’s
price slumped to a three-week low on speculation the Fed may
signal a reduction in economic stimulus.  OceanaGold Corp. plunged 9.8 percent to C$1.47 and Banro
Corp. slid 12 percent to C$1 to lead losses among miners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
