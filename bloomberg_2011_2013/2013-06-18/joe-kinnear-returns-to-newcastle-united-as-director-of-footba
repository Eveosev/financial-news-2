Joe Kinnear is returning to
 Newcastle United  as director of football on a three-year
contract, the English Premier League soccer club said.  Kinnear, 66, followed Kevin Keegan as Newcastle manager
during the 2008-09 season but left after having a heart attack.
A former Republic of Ireland international, he spent 10 years
playing for Tottenham Hotspur and also coached clubs including
Wimbledon, Luton and Nottingham Forest.  “The board are pleased to welcome Joe back to the club,”
managing director Derek Llambias said in a  statement  on the team
website today. “Joe has many years of experience working within
the game, and this experience will be of great benefit to the
club in achieving our objectives over the coming seasons.”  Newcastle, coached by  Alan Pardew , finished last season in
16th place in the 20-team league.  Kinnear will report directly to the board as the senior
executive in charge of all soccer-related matters, the club
said. Chief scout Graham Carr and Pardew will report to Kinnear.  The confirmation of Kinnear’s appointment comes two days
after he told  Sky Sports  he was returning to Newcastle.  To contact the reporter on this story:
