Kanye West ’s Messiah complex has
reached new heights. The man who once said that people looked at
him as if he was Hitler has a new album called “Yeezus” with a
one song, “I Am a God” (subtitled “featuring God”.)  West isn’t Jesus, perhaps not even a music deity to his
fans any more. He certainly isn’t Public Enemy or Jay-Z, or as
good as them. This CD is nowhere near his best.  It pushes X-rated hip-hop bragging off the scale with its
abrasive beats. This driving industrial music is not so radio-friendly: Think Nine Inch Nails mixed with Nirvana or Radiohead
at its most experimental.  West has repeatedly stated he is being ironic and is
misunderstood. He has nobody but himself to blame with efforts
like “New Slaves.”  The lyric goes: “f*** you and your Hampton house/ I’ll f***
your Hampton spouse/ c*** on her Hampton blouse/ and in her
Hampton mouth/ Y’all ’bout to turn s*** up/ I’m ’bout to tear
s*** down/ I’m ’bout to air s*** out/ Now what the f*** they
gon’ say now?” Oh, just shut up. Rating: No stars.  After 40 minutes of this fantasizing, it’s good to turn to
rock that’s more rewarding and by people who actually have
brains that they use.  New dad Kanye could learn much by listening to a female
rapper. While we wait for Azealia Banks’s debut album, “Broke
With Expensive Taste,” we still have her fine single “212” as a
taster. Rap need not be macho, it’s official. Rating: ***.  M.I.A. is also taking her time in releasing her new
collection “ Matangi .” Still, the single “ Bring the Noize ,”
released yesterday, sounds like a summer hit if ever there was
one. Rating: ***.  Daft Punk’s “ Random Access Memories ” is a blast of retro
dance. The French band has cooked up a quirky blend of 1980s
disco and cutting-edge electronics. It comes roaring out of the
speakers on “Give Life Back to Music” and rarely lets up -- with
the No. 1 hit “Get Lucky” a highlight. Rating: ****.  Queens of the Stone Age  have made a career with hard-edged
ZZ Top-style rock with a metallic edge. The bombast and pomp has
often been too much. That said, “…Like Clockwork” is its best
yet, with Dave Grohl on drums. Josh Homme peppers the tracks
with fuzzy guitar solos. Rating: ***.  Laura Marling ’s “Once I Was an Eagle” is a wonderfully
literate reflection. The English singer-songwriter is sensitive
and thoughtful: everything that West so often is not. She is
still only 23 and this is her fourth impressive record. Marling
is a  Joni Mitchell  for our times.  Ok, Marling’s acoustic strums are folk rather than hard
rock; the songs medley into each other and there’s hardly a
chorus to be heard. It’s still great. Rating: ****.  (Mark Beech writes for Muse, the arts and leisure section
