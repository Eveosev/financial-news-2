Corn gained, extending the biggest
monthly rally in more than two decades as the worst U.S. drought
in half a century persists, threatening global supply.  December-delivery corn gained as much as 1.4 percent to
$8.1675 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade after jumping to
a record $8.205 yesterday. Futures, which surged 27 percent last
month, the biggest monthly gain since 1988, traded at $8.15 at
12:31 p.m. Singapore time.  Temperatures in the Midwest will be mostly above normal in
the six to 10 days from yesterday and a few areas in the
northeastern part of the region may see normal rainfall, Telvent
DTN Inc. said. Twenty-four percent of the U.S. corn crop was
 rated  good-to-excellent as of July 29, the lowest since 1988,
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said July 30.  “The Midwest weather forecast remained unfavorable,” Eric Bailon, president of Manila-based Paritas Trading Corp., said
today. “Most of the corn crop was beyond repair.”  In the European Union, the largest corn-producing  region 
after North and South America, output will fall to 61.7 million
metric tons, from 66.8 million tons forecast last month and last
year’s 67.7 million tons, the EU Commission said yesterday.  Soybeans for November delivery advanced as much as 1.2
percent to $16.60 a bushel, extending a 15 percent jump in July,
the biggest monthly rally for the most-active contract since
June 2008, and traded at $16.57.  About 29 percent of soybeans were in good-to-excellent
 condition  as of July 29, the lowest ratings since 1988,
according to the USDA. About 55 percent of the crop was setting
pods, the USDA said July 30. That stage is when the plants begin
to set the pods and fill them with seeds, making it critical for
determining yields.  “The crop most impacted by this weather pattern during the
next few weeks will be pod filling soybeans,” Telvent said
yesterday.  Wheat for September delivery gained as much as 0.9 percent
to $8.965 a bushel, after a 17 percent rally in July. Futures
last traded at $8.9525 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
