London’s Docklands Light Railway
service, serving four Olympic sites, has resumed after a 30-
minute interruption because of a signal failure, Transport for
London said.  The service experienced severe delays on all routes,
including the Stratford station, Linda Egan, a spokeswoman for
Transport for London said in a telephone interview.  The DLR is one of the busiest lines during the  Olympic
Games  as it serves the Olympic Park in Stratford, the ExCel
center, Greenwich Park and the Royal Artillery Barracks.  The Marble Arch station, which was also closed due to a
 power failure , has reopened, TFL said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
