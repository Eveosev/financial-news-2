The yield on  Ghana ’s $750 million
Eurobonds fell for a fourth day after President John Dramani Mahama nominated central bank governor Kwesi Amissah-Arthur to
be his deputy, a week after the death of John Atta Mills.  Yield on the 8.5 percent debt, due 2017, declined six basis
points to 5.589 percent as of 2:21 p.m. in Accra, the capital,
the lowest since May 11 on a closing basis, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The appointment of Amissah-Arthur, a former deputy finance
minister, was announced to lawmakers today and referred to the
Parliament’s appointments committee, Speaker Joyce Bamford-Addo
said during proceedings.  “Amissah Arthur’s nomination as vice president will bring
vital technical expertise to the leadership and suggests policy
continuity, particularly given Mahama’s commitment to continuing
the late President John Atta Mills’ Better Ghana Agenda,” Sian
Bradley, an analyst with risk advisory company Maplecroft, based
in Bath,  England , said in an e-mailed note today. “In
conjunction with the smooth transition of power witnessed last
week, such policy consistency is likely to support the market’s
perception of decreasing risk.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
