Arise Windpower AB (AWP)  rose the most in
more than four months after the power producer said it signed a
contract to take over a project in northern  Sweden  that already
has the necessary permits.  The shares rose as much as 6.2 percent, the biggest
intraday jump since March 16, and traded at 27.30 kronor as of
12:05 p.m. local time.  The project outside Ornskoldsvik covers 40  wind turbines ,
of which Arise initially plans to build 25 to 30, according to a
statement today. The agreement is conditional on the resolution
of some remaining issues with landowners. The company plans to
have about 700 megawatts, or about 300 wind turbines, in
operation or under construction by 2014.  “The acquisition of the project is in line with the
company’s strategy to develop large wind farms in Norway and
Sweden,” Halmstad, Sweden-based Arise Windpower said in the
statement. “Detailed development plans are currently being
drawn up and it is expected that the wind farm will be connected
to the grid and go into operation by summer 2014.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
