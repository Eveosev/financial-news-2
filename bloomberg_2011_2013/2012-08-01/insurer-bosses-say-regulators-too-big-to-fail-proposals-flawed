International insurance regulators’
proposed method of designating companies with global systemic
importance could jeopardize the financial system and distort
competition, according to the industry’s top executives.  “The insurance sector and the wider financial system could
be destabilized if a designation method overlooks companies that
should be designated systemically risky or does not provide the
appropriate incentives to eliminate potential sources of
systemic risk,” The Geneva Association of insurance executives
 said  in a comment yesterday on a consultation paper posted on
the International Association of Insurance Supervisors’  website.   The IAIS and the Financial Stability Board, which
coordinates the work of regulators around the world, plan to
consider criteria including size, global activity and the amount
of non-insurance business to identify firms considered too big
to fail and thus deserving greater scrutiny.  “A designation based on size would be intuitively against
the basic insurance concept of the law of large numbers and the
benefits of the diversification of risks,” according to the
Geneva Association, a group of 90 chief executive officers from
insurance companies and reinsurers led by Munich Re CEO Nikolaus von Bomhard.  Countries and lenders may have greater trouble financing
themselves should insurance companies be motivated to cut their
holdings of government and bank debt to reduce their “systemic
risk” ranking, the group said.  The most appropriate way to identify systemic risk is to
look at industrywide practices and activities rather than
examine individual institutions, the Geneva group said. In a
research report in April 2011, it identified speculative
derivatives trading on non-insurance balance sheets and the
mismanagement of short-term funding as activities that could
pose systemic risks as defined by the FSB.  The IAIS had invited interested parties to comment on its
consultation document in May. The Financial Times reported the
Geneva Association’s comments earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
