The ruble weakened the most in more
than a week and yields on  Russia ’s local debt rose as demand for
the currency waned following the end of the monthly tax payment
period.  The Russian currency depreciated 0.5 percent to 32.3375 per
dollar by the close in Moscow after an 0.8 percent gain last
month. The country’s 54 billion rubles ($1.7 billion) of local
debt due March 2018 fell, increasing the yield by 13 basis
points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 7.93 percent.  Brent crude  rose to $106.15 per barrel, after dropping 1.2
percent yesterday. The U.S. Federal Reserve will forgo
announcing a third round of asset purchases after a two-day
meeting ends today, according to 88 percent of economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. Russian companies pay taxes in the second
half of every month. Exporters convert revenue from abroad into
rubles to pay the government, supporting the local currency.  “Oil’s two bucks lower, the tax period is over and
according to the Fed quantitative easing is not wanted now,”
Sergey Fishgoyt, deputy head of foreign exchange at Otkritie
Financial Corp. in Moscow, said by e-mail. “As for the EU,
things are scary. So it’s time to close longs in the ruble.”  Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said the  European
Central Bank  shouldn’t exceed its mandate in a June 29 interview
published today, a sign  Germany  may not approve further support
for countries affected by the region’s debt crisis.  The ruble dropped 0.5 percent to 39.7925 per euro and
35.6923 against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket.
Investors increased bets on the currency weakening, with non-
deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 32.8054 per dollar in
three months, compared with expectations of 32.715 per dollar
yesterday.  Russian  government bonds  worth 150 billion rubles matured
today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  Finance
Ministry  sold 9.3 billion rubles of 10-year notes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
