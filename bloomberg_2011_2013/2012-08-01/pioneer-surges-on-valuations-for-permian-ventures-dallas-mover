Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (PXD) , the
most active driller in Texas’s Permian Basin, rose after the
company said it expects higher valuations than a competitor for
joint ventures in shale oilfields.  Pioneer  gained  5.9 percent to $93.86 at the close in New
York.  Pioneer, based in Irving, Texas, expects to receive higher
prices for stakes in Permian Basin fields than  Devon Energy
Corp. (DVN) , which said today it sold a 30 percent stakes in two shale
oilfields to  Sumitomo Corp. (8053)  for $1.4 billion.  “Our acreage is a lot more proven and has a lot more
upside,” Pioneer Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Scott Sheffield said today during a conference call with analysts.
“It obviously should demand a much, much higher price.”  Pioneer can target as many as five producing deposits with
each well, compared with one zone for wells in the area where
Devon holds leases, he said.  Wells in the planned joint-venture area in the Wolfcamp
shale play in the Permian Basin produce an average of the
equivalent of 365 barrels of oil a day, according to the
company.  Devon is getting about $6,500 an acre in its venture with
Sumitomo, according to  Scott Hanold , a Minneapolis-based analyst
for RBC Capital Markets LLC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
