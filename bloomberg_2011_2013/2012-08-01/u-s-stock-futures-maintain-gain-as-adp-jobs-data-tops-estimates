U.S. stock futures maintained gains
after a private report showed employers last month added more
jobs than economists forecast, while investors focused on
today’s policy statement from the  Federal Reserve .  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring next
month were up 0.3 percent at 1,378.9 at 8:16 a.m. in New York.  Companies in the U.S. added 163,000 workers in July,
according to figures from ADP Employer Services. The median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey called for an advance of
120,000. Estimates of the 38 economists ranged from increases of
75,000 to 180,000.  The ADP report will be followed by the government’s monthly
jobs data on Aug. 3. Non-farm payrolls probably grew by 100,000
in July and the  unemployment rate  lingered at 8.2 percent,
according to the median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg
survey.  The S&P 500 rallied 1.3 percent in July, its second
successive month of gains, as euro-area policy makers pledged to
preserve their common currency and speculation grew central
banks will take measures to boost growth.            Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will probably
forgo announcing a third round of large-scale asset purchases
today, and is more likely to wait until September to unveil
plans to buy $600 billion in housing and government debt,
according to median estimates of economists in a Bloomberg News
survey.  `Door Open'  “Bernanke will leave the door open,” Larry Kantor, head
of research at  Barclays Capital , said on Bloomberg Television’s
City Central. “He doesn’t want to disappoint market
expectations too much but I don’t see the Fed making any move at
all this week.”  Eighty-eight percent of economists say the  Federal Open
Market Committee  will refrain from starting new purchases.
Forty-eight percent say the FOMC will announce the buying at its
Sept. 12-13 meeting, according to the July 25-27 survey of 58
economists.  Investors should buy stocks before the Fed’s announcement,
if history is any guide, according to Bespoke Investment Group
LLC. The  S&P 500  has advanced on 20 out of the past 29 decision
days since the Fed pledged to keep  interest rates  near zero in
December 2008, a Bespoke study showed. Fed days accounted for
about 38 percent of the equity gauge’s gain during the period,
the data show.  A report at 10 a.m. in Washington may show the  Institute
for Supply Management ’s factory index rose to 50.2 last month
from 49.7 in June, according to the median estimate of 83
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Fifty marks the dividing
line between expansion and contraction.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
