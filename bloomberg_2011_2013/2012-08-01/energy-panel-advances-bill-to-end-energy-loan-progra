A Republican-led panel advanced a
bill to bar the U.S. from issuing loan guarantees for energy
projects submitted since Jan. 1, a deadline Democrats said would
keep some cleaner-coal and nuclear efforts eligible for aid.  The “No More Solyndras Act” was approved 29-19 along
party lines today by the House Energy and Commerce Committee.  The bill was offered by Republicans after the collapse of
Solyndra LLC, recipient of a $535 million U.S. loan guarantee.
The legislation was proposed at the end of an 18-month
congressional investigation of the U.S. Energy Department award
to Solyndra. The Senate isn’t considering a similar measure.  Republicans said the bill will save money by ending
government efforts to pick winners and losers among energy
projects.  Representative  Edward Markey , a Massachusetts Democrat,
sought to amend the bill to end the loan program, a step that
would block projects already under review that include nuclear
and coal efforts that Republicans favor. His effort failed 3-39.  Representative Ed Whitfield, a Kentucky Republican, said
continuing to review applications submitted before Jan. 1 is
“only fair” to companies expecting aid. The Energy Department
has $34 billion in loan-guarantee authority left.  Republicans said solar- and wind-energy projects are among
existing applications that can proceed if the bill passes.  Democrats said the loan program has been a success, even
with Solyndra’s collapse.  The bill is H.R. 6213.  To contact the reporter on this story:
