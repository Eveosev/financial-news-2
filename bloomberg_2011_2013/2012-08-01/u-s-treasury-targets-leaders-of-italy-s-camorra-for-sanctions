The U.S. Treasury Department said it
designated five leaders of the Italian crime organization known
as the Camorra as targets for sanctions.  President  Barack Obama  designated the Camorra, which is
centered in and around the city of Naples, as a transnational
criminal organization on July 24, the Treasury said today in a
faxed statement. The group is one of Europe’s biggest crime
syndicates, involved in money laundering, extortion, alien
smuggling, robbery, blackmail, kidnapping, political corruption
and counterfeiting, according to the statement.  “The action is designed to squeeze the Camorra out of the
global financial system and protect the U.S. financial system
from laundering of its criminal proceeds,” Under Secretary for
Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
