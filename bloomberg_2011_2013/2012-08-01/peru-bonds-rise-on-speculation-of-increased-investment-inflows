Peru  government bond yields fell the
most in two weeks on expectations that Latin America’s fastest-
growing economy will attract investment from abroad.  The yield on the 7.84 percent sol-denominated bond due
August 2020 declined nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage
point, to 4.55 percent, the biggest drop since July 13. The
price rose 0.67 centimo to 121.79 centimos per sol.  Peru will post the fastest economic growth among major
Latin American economies this year, expanding 5.7 percent,
according to the median estimate of five analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Annual inflation  slowed to 3.28 percent in July from
4 percent a month earlier, the national statistics agency said
today, adding to evidence the central bank will leave its
benchmark interest rate unchanged for a 15th month.  “There’s a perception that Peru’s fundamentals remain
solid and it’s an attractive investment option,” said Juan
Carlos Odar, an economist at  Banco de Credito del Peru (CREDITC1)  in Lima.
“It’s perceived as a safe haven.”  Peru’s central bank on July 12 kept the overnight lending
rate unchanged at 4.25 percent.  The sol appreciated 0.1 percent to 2.6245 per  U.S. dollar ,
according to prices from Deutsche Bank AG’s Lima unit. The
central bank said it didn’t buy dollars in the  spot market 
today. The bank’s  international reserves  reached a record $58
billion yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
