Romania ’s heat wave that’s dried out
fields and damaged corn crops in the European Union’s second-
largest grower of the grain is set to continue into next week,
the country’s weather agency said.  Temperatures will climb as high as 38 degrees Celsius (100
degrees Fahrenheit) in the period through Aug. 8, the National
Meteorological Administration wrote in an agro-weather  bulletin 
today.  Average daily temperatures will range from 20 to 31 degrees
Celsius for most agricultural areas, 1 to 8 degrees higher than
normal, the weather office wrote. Small amounts of rain may fall
locally, particularly in the north and southeast.  Most of the country will continue to be in drought, ranging
from moderate to extreme, the forecaster said. Hot weather and a
lack of water is forcing crop maturation, causing wilting and
curling leaves and weakening corn and sunflowers, the weather
office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
