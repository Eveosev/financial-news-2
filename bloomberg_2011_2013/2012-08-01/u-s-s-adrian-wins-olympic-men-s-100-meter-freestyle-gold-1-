(Corrects name in first paragraph.)  Nathan Adrian of the U.S. won the
Olympic men’s 100-meter freestyle, upsetting world champion
James Magnussen of  Australia  by 0.01 second.  Adrian won in 47.52 seconds, while Magnussen took silver in
47.53 seconds. Brent Hayden of Canada got the bronze in 47.80
seconds.  Magnussen had been the favorite to win the race after he’d
clocked the fastest time in the semifinal. He had finished in
fourth place with the Australian 400-meter freestyle relay team.
Adrian was a gold medalist in the 400-meter freestyle relay at
the Beijing Olympics.  Adrian’s victory is the first for the U.S. in the event
since Matt Biondi won gold at the Seoul  Olympic Games  in 1988.  To contact the reporter on this story:
