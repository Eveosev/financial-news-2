British insurers paid out 200 million
pounds ($312 million) to homeowners, motorists and retailers
over the 12 months since last August’s riots in  London ,
Birmingham and Manchester.  Insurance companies have settled or made initial payments
on about 95 percent of the 3,000 claims made, the  Association of
British Insurers  said in an e-mailed statement today. The figure
doesn’t include uninsured businesses making claims against the
police under the Riot Damages Act of 1886.  More than 1,500 people were arrested following the worst
civil disorder since the 1980s in London, when rioters broke
into shops, looted goods and set cars and property on fire. The
unrest began Aug. 6 in the north London suburb of Tottenham
after a local black man,  Mark Duggan , was shot and killed by
police who had stopped his car intending to make an arrest. The
violence later spread to other U.K. cities including Manchester,
Birmingham, Bristol and Leeds.  “While insurers have settled or paid against the vast
majority of claims, over half of claims submitted by insurers to
police authorities under the Riot Damages Act have been
declined,” Aidan Kerr, head of property at the ABI, said in the
statement. “This shows insurers are doing all they can to look
after their customers, despite not getting their claims settled
by the police authorities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
