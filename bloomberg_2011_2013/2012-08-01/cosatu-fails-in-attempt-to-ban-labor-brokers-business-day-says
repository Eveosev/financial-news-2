The Congress of South African Trade
Unions said it was unsuccessful in its attempt to have labor
brokers banned in the country, Business Day reported, citing
Prakashnee Govender, the union federation’s parliamentary
officer.  Cosatu will report back to its members on its failure to
abolish companies that provide temporary workers and will
continue to push to have them banned, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper cited Govender as saying before Parliament’s labor
committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
