German plant and machinery orders
declined at a slower pace in June as domestic sales gained for
the first time in six months, the VDMA machine-makers’
association said.  Orders, adjusted for inflation, fell 1 percent from a year
earlier after declining an annual 6 percent in May, the
Frankfurt-based VDMA said in an e-mailed statement today. While
orders from abroad fell 3 percent from a year ago, domestic
orders rose 3 percent. In the second quarter, orders decreased 6
percent from the same period last year.  “Demand from the non-euro countries seems to have passed
through the low point,” said VDMA economist Olaf Wortmann.
“There were some surprises from the euro area, although the
increase of 18 percent relates partly to base effects. June 2011
was the second-weakest month last year. There were also some
bulk orders in June 2012.”  For the first half of the year, VDMA said orders overall
fell 7 percent compared to the same period in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
