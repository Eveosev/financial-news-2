The European Union may miss a January
2013 deadline to implement tougher capital and bonus rules, the
U.K.  Financial Services Authority  said on its website today.  Discussions among lawmakers and finance ministers from the
27-member bloc have taken longer than originally scheduled,
making it “clear the legislation will not be adopted earlier
than autumn 2012,” the U.K.  financial watchdog said  in a
statement. Translation, verification and signing of the text
make it “unfeasible” that the rules will take effect on time.  Governments face a January 2013 deadline set by the Basel
Committee for Banking Supervision to implement the draft law,
which would more than triple the core capital that lenders must
have to 7 percent of their risk-weighted assets. The Group of 20
nations said banks should boost their reserves to prevent any
repeat of the wave of taxpayer bailouts that followed the 2008
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  “In light of these developments the FSA will keep the
situation under active review and continue to support the
European institutions in their efforts to reach a conclusion on
the final version of the legislation,” the watchdog said in the
statement.  EU lawmakers have sought to limit bankers’ bonuses to no
more than their annual salary as part of their implementation of
the rules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
