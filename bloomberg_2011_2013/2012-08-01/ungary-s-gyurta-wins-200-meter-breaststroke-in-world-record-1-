Missy Franklin, Dana Vollmer and
Allison Schmitt all won their second gold medals of the London
Games as the U.S. swam to victory against  Australia  by almost a
second and a half in the 800-meter freestyle relay.  Daniel Gyurta of  Hungary  won the 200-meter breaststroke in
world-record time, American Nathan Adrian swam to the 100-meter
freestyle gold medal by a hundredth of a second and Jiao Liuyang

42.92 seconds, while Australia took silver in 7:44.41.  France 
got the bronze in 7:47.49.  “The first three ladies had an amazing swim and I just
wanted to bring it home for them,” Schmitt told reporters after
anchoring the winning relay team. “I just wanted to feed off
that energy and bring home the gold tonight for the relay.”  Franklin, 17, a Colorado high school senior, had won her
first gold medal in the 100-meter backstroke. Vollmer, 24, was
first in the 100-meter butterfly and Schmitt, 22, won earlier in
the 200-meter freestyle event.  Gyurta, 23, won the gold in 2 minutes, 7.28 seconds, ahead
of Britain’s Michael Jamieson in second place, and Ryo Tateishi,
22, of  Japan  in third. Kosuke Kitajima of Japan, who was
attempting to become the first man to win the same swimming
event at three consecutive Olympics, was fourth.  Adrian defeated world champion James Magnussen of Australia
by 0.01 seconds. Magnussen, 21, clocked the fastest time in the
semifinals.  “It’s pretty amazing seeing a 1 next to your name,”
Adrian told reporters. “I almost started crying in the water.”  Adrian was in third place after the first 50 meters before
rallying to take the gold. Magnussen swam back for the silver
medal after being in fifth place on the first leg.  Adrian’s Win  Adrian won in a time of 47.52 seconds, while Magnussen
touched the wall in 47.53.  Canada ’s Brent Hayden got the bronze

before Gyurta took over and broke the record of 2:07.31 set by
Australia’s Christian Sprenger in 2009.  “It won’t change me,” said Gyurta, the world champion in
2009 and 2011. “The only thing it will change is my cabinet at
home.”  World champion Jiao won the 200-meter butterfly in an
Olympic record of 2:04:06, ahead of Mireia Belmonte Garcia of
 Spain  in second place and Natsumi Hoshi of Japan in third.  To contact the reporter on this story:
