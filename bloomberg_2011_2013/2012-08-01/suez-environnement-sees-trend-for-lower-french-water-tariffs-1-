Suez Environnement,  Europe ’s second-
biggest waste and water utility, said French municipal water
contracts are being signed at lower rates.  “Are we expecting a trend for lower prices during
renegotiations in France? The answer is yes,” Chief Financial
Officer Jean-Marc Boursier said today on a conference call,
referring to accords due for renewal. “We remain more or less
in line with what we published at the start of the year which is
10 to 12 percent lower at the moment of renegotiation.”  Competitor  Veolia Environnement SA (VIE) ’s margins are shrinking
on the French market due to “contractual erosion,” it said May
4. Veolia has 34.5 percent of the French drinking-water market
and 22 percent of the treatment industry while  Suez
Environnement (SEV) , through its Lyonnaise des Eaux unit, has 20
percent of the markets for both water distribution and
treatment, according to 2010 figures from industry group FP2E.  “In France we win more sales than we lose,” Boursier
said. “Sometimes we are forced to lower prices,” which can be
due to less investment or services included in the contracts, he
said.  “For the first half of 2012 we have renewed all our big
contracts,” Chief Executive Officer Jean-Louis Chaussade said.  Last month, Suez Environnement signed a preliminary
agreement to renew a water-treatment contract in Bordeaux that
will lower rates for households.  To contact the reporter on this story:
