Australia ’s resources boom is
boosting demand for office space, with vacancies in the biggest
cities falling to 7.8 percent as of July 1, the lowest since
2009, even as supply rose above historical levels, according to
the  Property Council of Australia .  Office vacancies in central business districts fell to 7.3
percent as of July 1, from 8.3 percent a year earlier, with
three quarters of the demand from Perth and Brisbane, the
council said in its Office Market Report. Some 404,857 square
meters (4.35 million square feet) of office space was added
across Australia’s eight state capitals in the six months to
July 1, compared with a 20-year historical average of 283,986
square meters, according to the statement.  “While demand for  office space  is a buoyant 50 percent
above the 20-year historical average, three quarters of net
central business district absorption occurred in just Perth and
Brisbane,” Peter Verwer, chief executive officer of the
Property Council, said in an e-mailed release.  Australia hasn’t suffered a recession since 1991 and the
nation’s mining boom, driven largely by Chinese and Indian
demand for  iron ore , coal and liquefied natural gas from Western
Australia and Queensland states, is expected to last decades.
Western Australia’s unemployment rate fell to 3.5 percent in
June from 3.8 percent the previous month, the lowest in the
country, while Queensland dropped to 5.3 percent from 5.7
percent.  The vacancy rate in central Perth fell to 4.2 percent as of
July 1, compared with 7.8 percent a year earlier, even as
157,926 square meters of space was added in 2012, the highest on
record. Sydney and  Melbourne  also saw vacancies fall, to 8.2
percent from 9.4 percent a year ago, and to 5.6 percent from 5.8
percent respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
