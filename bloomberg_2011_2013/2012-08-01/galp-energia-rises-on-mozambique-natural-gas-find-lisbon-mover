Galp Energia SGPS SA, Portugal’s
biggest oil company, rose in Lisbon after announcing a “giant
natural-gas discovery” in an offshore block in Mozambique in
which it holds a stake.  The stock closed up 0.7 percent at 11.075 euros. Galp holds
10 percent in the group that discovered the natural gas.  Eni
SpA (ENI) , Italy’s largest oil producer, has 70 percent.  “Good results from companies in the sector may also be
bolstering” the stock, said  Pedro Oliveira , a trader at Go
Bulling in Lisbon.  Eni’s second-quarter adjusted net income rose to 1.46
billion euros ($1.8 billion) from 1.44 billion euros a year
earlier, the Rome-based company said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
