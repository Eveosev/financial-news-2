India’s 10-year bonds rose, snapping
a six-day decline, on speculation yields near a seven-week high
will attract investors.  Yields jumped yesterday after the central bank lowered the
amount of  debt  banks need to hold to 23 percent of deposits from
24 percent with effect from Aug. 11, the first reduction since
2010. The  Reserve Bank  of India kept the repurchase  rate 
unchanged at 8 percent at the policy review yesterday while
cutting its economic-growth forecast for the year through March
2013 to 6.5 percent from 7.3 percent.  “These are probably good levels to add to holdings,” said
Mumbai-based Srinivasa Raghavan, vice president of treasury at
Dhanalaxmi Bank Ltd. “Given the concerns over growth, it’s a
question of time before  interest rates  are cut. I expect that to
happen within three months.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.23 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. The rate
touched 8.25 percent yesterday, the highest level since the debt
was sold on June 11.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose three basis
points to 7.76 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
