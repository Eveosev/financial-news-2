Bonds of  Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP) 
plummeted to the lowest price since January as analysts raise
questions about the Chinese solar manufacturer’s ability to
refinance its debt.  Suntech’s $541 million of convertible notes due March 2013
dropped to 45 cents on the dollar yesterday, down from 70.8
cents on July 24, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. That’s
the lowest since Jan. 3.  Suntech, which has said it needs additional funding to
continue operating, may have been defrauded by an affiliate, the
firm said July 30. After the Wuxi, China-based company
guaranteed a 554.2 million-euro loan in 2010 to a Global Solar
Fund S.C.A. backer, it discovered financial irregularities at
GSF, which is managed by a former sales representative, Javier Romero.  “We think the company will never be able to repay its
debt, and we have consistently called the company a poor steward
of investor capital,”  Jesse Pichel , an analyst with Jefferies
Group Inc. in  New York , said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporters on this story:
