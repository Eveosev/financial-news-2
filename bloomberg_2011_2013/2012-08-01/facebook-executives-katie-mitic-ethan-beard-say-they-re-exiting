Facebook Inc. (FB)  executives Katie Mitic
and Ethan Beard are leaving to pursue new opportunities, 
bringing to three the number of high-profile management departures 
since the social-networking website’s May initial public offering.  Mitic, former director of platform marketing, will be
working at a mobile startup, she said today on her Facebook
profile page. Beard, who was director of platform partnerships,
posted on his profile that he’s starting his own venture.  “After an amazing two years at Facebook, it’s time to
start my next entrepreneurial adventure,” said Mitic, who is
also on the board of online retailer  EBay Inc. (EBAY)  “I’m so grateful
to have met, learned from and worked with the incredible people
here.”  Facebook’s former chief technology officer, Bret Taylor,
said in June that he was leaving. The resignations come as the
company faces greater pressure to add products and services to
woo more developers and users to its site. Since the May 17 IPO,
Facebook’s shares have fallen 45 percent on concern that growth
in advertising revenue won’t keep pace with membership.  Beard said he plans to take some time off to “recharge”
before his new venture and thanked Chief Executive Officer  Mark
Zuckerberg  and Chief Operating Officer  Sheryl Sandberg .  “For the past 4+ years I’ve had the privilege of working
with some of the most brilliant people on one of the most
impactful products the world has ever seen,” he said.  Facebook, based in Menlo Park, California, fell 3.8 percent
to $20.88 at the close in New York today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
