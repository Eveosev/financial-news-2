Chelyabinsk Pipe Works (CHEP) ’s lenders want
more guarantees from the plant’s owners in restructuring its
debts worth of 113 billion rubles ($3.5 billion),  Vedomosti 
said, citing four unidentified people familiar with the matter.  Creditors want to get personal guarantees from owners of
the plant, a non-state producer of pipes for the oil and gas
industry known as ChelPipe, besides the state guarantees they
already have, the newspaper said. The lenders, which include 20
banks, require owners Andrey Komarov and Alexander Fedorov to
put their shares up as security as well, Vedomosti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
