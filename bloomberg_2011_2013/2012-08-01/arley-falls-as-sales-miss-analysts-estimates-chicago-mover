Harley-Davidson Inc. (HOG) , the biggest
U.S. motorcycle maker, fell the most in 3 1/2 years after
second-quarter revenue trailed analysts’ estimates and the
company said currency exchange rates will hurt profit margins.  The  shares  slid 4.5 percent to $41.27 at 12:09 p.m. in  New
York  after tumbling 12 percent for the steepest intraday drop
since January 2009. The Milwaukee-based company’s stock had
gained 11 percent this year through yesterday.  Harley reported quarterly sales excluding financial
services of $1.57 billion, compared with the $1.63 billion
average of 10 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Chief Financial
Officer  John Olin  said on a conference call today that currency
rates reduced revenue per bike in the quarter and are expected
to contribute to lower gross margins in the second half.  “In the first quarter, particularly in  North America , we
saw a release of some pent-up demand along with the warm winter
and spring, which pulled some sales forward,” Keith Wandell,
Harley’s chief executive officer, said in an interview. “Now,
we’re sort of swinging back into being more conservative and
trying to figure what’s going to happen with the global economy
and the election and where our economy is headed.”  Harley sold 55,761 motorcycles in the U.S. during the
second quarter, a 4 percent increase from a year earlier, as
global sales rose 2.8 percent to 85,714, according to its
earnings statement. The company’s U.S. sales had surged
26 percent in the first quarter.  Profit Increase  Net income  for the maker of Super Glide and Night Rod
motorcycles rose 30 percent to $247.3 million, or $1.07 a share,
compared with $190.6 million, or 81 cents, a year earlier,
Harley said. The average  estimate  of 12 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was $1.05 a share.  Revenue excluding financial services rose 17 percent from
the second quarter of 2011, as total sales increased 15 percent
to $1.73 billion. The company gets about a third of its revenue
from motorcycles and related products outside the U.S.  Harley benefited from reduced costs through renegotiating
labor contracts at factories in Pennsylvania and  Wisconsin .
Bikes such as the $7,999 Super Low, less pricey and easier to
handle, are winning new riders. The company hired Wandell in
2009 from the No. 2 position at Johnson Controls Inc. to revive
operations.  Second-quarter  gross margin  widened to 35.9 percent of
sales from 35 percent. Operating margin from motorcycles and
related products climbed to 19.7 percent from 16.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
