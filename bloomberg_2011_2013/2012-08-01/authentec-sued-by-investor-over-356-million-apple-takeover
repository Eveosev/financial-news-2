AuthenTec Inc. (AUTH) , the electronic
fingerprint-authentication provider that  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  is buying
for $356 million, was sued by an investor who contends the price
is too low.  AuthenTec directors have a duty to get the best value for
shareholders and wrongly accepted Apple’s bid of $8 a share, the
plaintiff, Craven Lee, said in a Delaware Chancery Court
complaint made public today in Wilmington.  “AuthenTec, if properly exposed to the market for
corporate control, would bring a price materially in excess of
the amount offered,” Lee said in the complaint.  Apple, based in Cupertino, California, agreed to acquire
AuthenTec to gain fingerprint-authentication and encryption
security technology for the iPad and iPhone. Under the
agreement, Apple also has the right to pay patent licenses
totaling as much as $115 million.  AuthenTec, based in  Melbourne , Florida, makes fingerprint
sensors that corporations use to secure access to  computer
networks . The company would have to pay Apple a termination fee
of $10.95 million in cash if the company decides to accept an
alternative offer, according to court papers.  Brent Dietz, a spokesman for AuthenTec, didn’t return a
call seeking comment on the lawsuit.  AuthenTec fell 1.7 percent to $8.26 at 12 p.m.  New York 
time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Apple fell 0.6 percent to
$606.86.  The case is Lee v. AuthenTec Inc., CA7735, Delaware
Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
