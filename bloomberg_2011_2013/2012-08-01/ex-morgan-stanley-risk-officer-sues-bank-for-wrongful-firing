A former risk officer for  Morgan
Stanley (MS)  Smith Barney LLC sued the firm over claims he was
unfairly fired for reporting securities “flipping” by one of
the firm’s wealth managers.  Clifford Jagodzinski alleged in a complaint filed today in
federal court in New York that he was terminated in April after
reporting the wealth manager’s questionable trading, which he
claimed was “obviously designed to bilk investors” by driving
up commissions.  Jagodzinski said his superiors at first praised him for
reporting the trading, as well as pointing out other activities
he thought were improper, then told him to halt his
investigations. He was fired days after he said the trading
should be disclosed to the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority, according to the complaint.  “This was the very archetype of unlawful retaliation,”
according to the complaint.  Christine Pollak, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley, said
in a phone interview that the company believes “the complaint
is without merit” and will defend itself in the case.  Jagodzinski also claimed he had discovered improper trading
by other employees, found that some financial advisers failed to
register home offices as alternative work sites, and found that
one adviser was abusing drugs.  The complaint, alleging violations of the Dodd-Frank
whistle-blower statute, seeks reinstatement and at least $1
million in damages.  The case is Jagodzinski v. Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC,
12-cv-5891, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York 
( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
