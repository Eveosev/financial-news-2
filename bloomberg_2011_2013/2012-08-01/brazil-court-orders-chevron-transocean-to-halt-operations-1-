A Brazilian court ordered  Chevron
Corp. (CVX) , the second-biggest U.S. energy company, and  Transocean
Ltd. (RIG)  to halt operations in 30 days while investigations of two
oil spills are conducted.  Each company will have to pay 500 million reais ($243
million) for each day it fails to comply with the order, the
court said in an e-mailed statement. The halt will last until
the federal prosecutors office, the country’s oil regulator and
environmental agencies complete investigating oil spills in
November and March, the court said.  Chevron had an  oil spill  at the Frade project off the coast
of Brazil in November and identified oil seeps on the ocean
floor in March. The company halted output at Frade in March and
doesn’t produce at any other fields in Brazil. Transocean
provided the drilling rig for the well that leaked and has nine
rigs operating in the country, according to information on the
company’s website.  Brazil’s oil regulator has estimated the size of the
November oil spill at 3,700 barrels, while Chevron says it
spilled about 2,400 barrels. There were no injuries in the
drilling accident or damage to marine life, according to
Chevron’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
