Iranian officials signed a contract
valued at $25 million with a domestic company to develop the
Soumar oil field in the country’s western region, the Oil
Ministry’s website Shana  reported .  Iranian Central Oil Fields Co., an affiliate of National
Iranian Oil Co., signed the agreement today with a state-owned
construction and investment company, Shana said, citing Mehdi
Fakour, the managing director of Iranian Central Oil Fields.  The Soumar field in Kermanshah province has an estimated
475 million barrels in reserves and will be developed in two
phases in two years, the report said. It will produce 5,000
barrels a day of crude after completion of the first phase and
15,000 barrels after the second, according to Shana.  To contact the reporter on this story:
