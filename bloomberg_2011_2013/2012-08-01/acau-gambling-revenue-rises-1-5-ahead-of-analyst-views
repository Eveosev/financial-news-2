Macau gaming revenue rose 1.5 percent
in July, beating estimates from some analysts who predicted a
little changed or lower result on declining demand from mainland
Chinese gamblers and the impact of a  Hong Kong  typhoon.  Gaming revenue in the world’s biggest gambling hub rose to
24.6 billion patacas ($3.08 billion) from 24.2 billion patacas,
a year earlier, the city’s Gaming Inspection and Coordination
Bureau said in a statement today. The growth beat the
expectations of analysts at Wells Fargo & Co. and Bank of
America Merrill Lynch.  Sands China Ltd. (1928) , the Asian unit of  Sheldon Adelson ’s Las
Vegas company, climbed 2.2 percent to close at HK$23.45. Wynn
Macau Ltd. gained 4.4 percent,  SJM Holdings Ltd. (880)  rose 3.8
percent.  Cameron McKnight, an analyst at Wells Fargo, wrote in a
research note to clients this week that revenue near the end of
July may have been hurt by a typhoon in Hong Kong, from where
ferry services operate to Macau. McKnight had predicted the
revenue could be unchanged or down.  July’s growth was the slowest pace since June 2009. High-
stake bettors from China’s mainland have pulled back as  Asia ’s
largest economy has slowed. Wynn Macau last month reported a
drop in revenue for the second quarter and Sands  China  posted a
40 percent drop in second-quarter profit after an impairment
charge and lower winnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
