Egypt ’s presidency has initiated
legal action against several journalists over alleged insulting
and inaccurate reports about President Mohamed Mursi, the state-
run  Al-Ahram  newspaper reported today.  Legal measures were also taken against a foreign news
agency that allegedly fabricated an interview with Mursi,
presidential spokesman Yasser Ali was quoted as saying by the
Cairo-based daily. He did not identify any of the journalists or
the foreign agency.  Mursi’s office earlier denied that he was interviewed by
Iran’s Fars News Agency. The agency published an interview with
him hours before he was declared the winner in a presidential
runoff race last month, quoting him as saying that he would work
to improve relations with  Iran .  To contact the reporter on this story:
