The Philippine peso fell from a one-
week high before policy decisions by the  European Central Bank 
and the  Federal Reserve . Government bonds advanced.  The ECB may unveil additional economic stimulus tomorrow
after President  Mario Draghi  said on July 26 that policy makers
are “ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro.” Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will probably forgo announcing a third
round of large-scale asset purchases this week, and is likely to
wait until September, according to median estimates of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. China reported today that
manufacturing expanded at the slowest pace in eight months.  The major central banks “will definitely do something, but
it’s a matter of whether it’s a game changer,” said Leong Sook
Mei, the regional head of global currency research at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in Singapore  “There’s some degree of
caution.”  The peso dropped 0.1 percent to 41.762 per dollar in
 Manila , according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency touched
41.74 yesterday, the highest level since July 20. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, declined 25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage
point, to 6 percent.  The peso has appreciated 4.9 percent this year, the best
performance among Asia’s 11 most-active currencies, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to 50.1 in July
from 50.2 in June. That’s less than the 50.5 median estimate in
a Bloomberg News survey of 24 economists. A reading above 50
indicates expansion.  The yield on the government’s 5.875 percent bonds due March
2032 fell three basis points to 5.63 percent, according to
prices from Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
