Business conditions in Turkish
manufacturing worsened in July, with a reading of 49.4
indicating a contraction for the first time since March.  The July manufacturing HSBC purchasing managers’ index fell
to the lowest level since August last year from 51.4 in June,
Markit Economics and HSBC Holdings Plc said in an e-mailed
 report  today. Anything above 50 indicates an expansion.  “Both output and new orders decreased in July,” they
said. “New business fell for the fourth month in 2012 so far
following stagnation in June. A number of panelists reported
that weakness in European markets had prevented stronger growth
of new export business.”  Turkey ’s economic growth is slowing from an annual
expansion of 8.5 percent last year. The economy shrank 0.4
percent quarterly in the first three months, the first
contraction since March 2009, after the crisis in the  euro zone 
intensified and the central bank tightened monetary policy to
slow consumer demand for imports that had widened the current
account deficit to a record.  Yields on  benchmark two-year bonds  fell four basis points,
or 0.04 percentage points, to 7.58 percent at 10:33 a.m. in
Istanbul, the lowest level since January 2011. The lira
strengthened 0.2 percent to 1.7923 per dollar. The main  ISE
National 100 (XU100)  share index climbed 0.3 percent to 64,481.16.  Employment is rising, though at a weaker pace, HSBC and
Markit Economics said in the report. Output prices declined for
the first month since November 2009, they said.  Consumer confidence  in Turkey declined to 94.6 in July from
96.3 in June, CNBC-e television reported from Istanbul today
citing a survey it commissioned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
