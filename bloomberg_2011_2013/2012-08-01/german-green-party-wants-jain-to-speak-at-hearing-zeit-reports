Germany’s Greens want  Deutsche Bank
AG (DBK)  co-Chief Executive Officer Anshu Jain to speak at a hearing
of the lower house of parliament’s finance committee, Die Zeit
reported, citing  Gerhard Schick , the party’s finance spokesman.  Large banks haven’t changed many of their ways since the
financial crisis and it is unacceptable for taxpayers to fund
rescues without politicians gaining insight into their practices
to correct mistakes, the newspaper cited Schick as saying.  The Green Party wants to schedule a hearing for September
and invite the most important executives in Germany’s financial
industry, Die Zeit reported, citing the lawmaker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
