China North East Petroleum Holdings
Ltd. (CNEP)  must face a shareholder lawsuit accusing the company of
inflating proven oil reserve numbers, a U.S. appeals court
ruled.  The U.S. Court of Appeals in  Manhattan  today reversed a
lower court’s dismissal of the case, finding that shareholders’
losses weren’t necessarily remedied by a recovery in the stock
price.  “A share of a stock that has regained its value after a
period of decline is not functionally equivalent to an inflated
share that has never lost value,” U.S. Circuit Judge Chester Straub wrote for the three-judge panel.  Investors had alleged that New York-based China North East
Petroleum’s stock price fell sharply in 2009 and 2010 following
disclosures about a misevaluation of oil reserves and a failure
to account for certain warrants.  In May 2010, the company said that the  New York  Stock
Exchange had halted trading in its shares and that members of
management would be resigning, Straub wrote. Trading resumed in
September 2010, according to the opinion.  The company argued that rebounds in the stock price could
have erased shareholder losses, the opinion said.  “The decision will have zero impact on the case,” Michael
Coffino, a lawyer for China North East Petroleum, said in a
phone interview today. “All the theories and arguments remain
intact and we’re looking forward to a dismissal on other grounds
in the near future.”  The case is Acticon AG v. China North East Petroleum Ltd.,
11-cv-4544,  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Second Circuit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
