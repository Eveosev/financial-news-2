Turkey ’s bond yields fell to the
lowest in more than 1 1/2 years after a manufacturing gauge re-
entered contraction territory.  Yields on two-year benchmark debt slid for a third day,
retreating two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.60
percent by the close in Istanbul, the least since January 2011.
The lira depreciated for the first time in six days, trading
less than 0.1 percent weaker at 1.7960 per dollar.  The July manufacturing HSBC purchasing managers’ index fell
to 49.4, the lowest since August, from 51.4 in June and 49.6 in
March, HSBC said in an e-mailed statement today. A reading below
50 indicates contraction. Turkey’s  consumer confidence  index
fell to 94.6 in July from 96.3 in the previous month, CNBC-e
television reported from Istanbul today, citing a survey it
conducted. Turkey’s  trade deficit  narrowed to $7.2 billion from
$10.2 billion a year ago, the statistics office in Ankara said
on its website yesterday.  “Worries about growth are becoming more emphasized and
there is a generally rate-friendly environment in the world,”
Sercan Kiliclar, a fixed-income trader at  Akbank TAS (AKBNK)  in
Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments. “Today’s data are
supporting this.”  The Turkish government sees economic growth falling to 4
percent this year from 8.5 percent last year. Gross domestic
product contracted 0.4% in the first quarter, the first time
since March 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
